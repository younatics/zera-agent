"By . James Chapman, Political Editor . For all those Britons with an overseas holiday booked and paid for – but still waiting for their long-delayed passports to drop through the letter box, it wasn’t the most tactful of remarks. Tourism minister Helen Grant suggested they consider holidaying at home. In fact, she said, there was a ‘lot to be said for the “staycation”.’ To rub salt into the wound, the minister’s pronouncement emerged as she watched England take on Uruguay – in her other role as sports minister – in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Scroll down for video . Sport and Tourism Minister Helen Grant watched the World Cup match between Uruguay and England at Arena de Sao Paulo in Brazil last night . Sport and tourism minister Helen Grant, right, tweeted this picture of herself with her Uruguayan counterpart Liliam Kechichián at a FA reception in Sao Paulo tonight . Last night her intervention attracted a . furious response with victims of the passport crisis denouncing her . comments as ludicrous and appalling. Earlier . this week, Home Secretary Theresa May apologised to people whose travel . plans had been disrupted by delays at the Passport Office – there is a . backlog of around 30,000 applications – and unveiled a series of . emergency measures to speed matters up. Miss . Grant, asked about the situation in an interview with political . magazine The House, said: ‘I’m in no doubt, I’m very confident that . people will get their passports. ‘But . if they don’t want to go away, we have some fantastic places to visit . and holiday. I think there’s a lot to be said for the “staycation”. People need to do what they like. ‘We . are going to have a great summer, we are certainly going to have a . great summer of sport too, there’s lots of opportunities to build your . holiday around a spoilt-for-choice list of events – the Tour de France . Grand Depart, we’ve got the golf, we’ve got the Commonwealth Games. It’s . a wonderful place to have your holiday.’ Government . sources said it was clear Miss Grant, the MP for Maidstone and the . Weald, had not been telling people where to holiday, but simply . extolling the virtues of Britain as a destination. However, retired . nurse Eileen Shepherd, 68 – who had to miss out on a £1,750 cruise after . she was told the day before she was due to sail that her passport was . not ready – said of Miss Grant: ‘How dare she tell us where to go on . holiday? Cheeky sod. People will be gunning for her.’ Mrs . Shepherd, of Darlington added: ‘She is not living in the real world. It . is appalling. Ministers have no business telling me where I can take a . break.’ Martin Cook, 43, . from Ipswich, only got his passport the day before he flew out to Prague . for a weekend away with his wife Annabel last month, despite submitting . his application four weeks earlier. Miss Grant had said she was confident the passport application backlog would be cleared, despite holidaymakers queuing outside the Passport Office in London . The . BT project manager said: ‘Helen Grant’s comments are laughable. It is . ludicrous. It is not her place to tell people where to holiday. If . somebody has made their plans and put their passport application in in . good time they should be able to travel where they like.’ Labour . also condemned Miss Grant’s remarks. David Hanson, immigration . spokesman, said: ‘What does she know that we don’t? Is this crisis going . to last all summer? Holidays in Britain are fantastic but ministers . shouldn’t be trying to divert attention from the chaos  they created. ‘People . need their passports for business, family funeral visits, residency . permits and other personal reasons as well as holidays. Helen Grant . should be on to the Home Office to get this sorted now, rather than . telling families they won’t be going abroad any time soon.’ But . Labour also risked embarrassment, after former minister Tom Watson . appeared to agree with Miss Grant. ‘It’s already bad enough that holiday . companies ramp up the cost of flights in school holidays,’ he said. ‘Perhaps the passport fiasco will encourage people to stay at home, to . support the British tourism industry.’ Passport . officials say they have been hit by the highest level of applications . for 12 years, with the usual summer increase starting far earlier than . usual. David Cameron has . said that anyone with imminent travel  plans would be fast-tracked . without charge. Applicants renewing from overseas will have a  12-month . extension to their  existing passport. A . Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesman said: ‘Helen Grant . was crystal clear that she was confident that people would get their . passports to be able to travel overseas. As tourism minister it is . completely right that she champions the domestic tourism market but she . was in no way linking the two issues.’ The backlog of passport applications at an office in Liverpool.

"By . Chris Pleasance . The South Korean navy held a live-fire drill near a set of disputed islands yesterday, despite protests from Japan over the 'deplorable' exercise. The Korean defence ministry said the drill around the Seoul-controlled islets, called Dokdo by the South and Takeshima by Japan, were part of the military's 'regular' national defence training. The navy and coastguard have staged joint exercises near Dokdo many times, but a live-fire drill is rare and it prompted an angry response from Japan. Scroll down for video . The SOuth Korean navy has held a live-fire drill in the Sea of Japan near a set of dispute islands which has drawn condemnation from the Japanese government . Japan's chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga described the drill as 'extremely deplorable' and demanded that South Korean stop the exercise . 'Japan can never accept the drill given its position on Takeshima, and so we strongly demanded that the South Korean government stop its plans,' Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters in Tokyo. Suga, the government's top spokesman, said the decision to push ahead with the exercises was 'extremely deplorable'. Seoul dismissed the Japanese protests out of hand. 'This is a military drill to bolster the defence of the Republic of Korea, so any outside demand or interference is not a subject for consideration,' ministry spokesman Wi Yong-Seop said. 'The drill is now being carried out as scheduled,' Wi said. A total of 19 naval ships and aircraft were involved, including a light destroyer and a Lynx anti-submarine helicopter. A Navy spokesman said the exercise was . playing out defence scenarios against a variety of potential . antagonists, 'including North Korea'. Earlier . this week, North Korean state media released pictures of leader Kim . Jong-un overseeing a naval drill from the turret of a submarine. The Dokdo-Takeshima islands have been the subject of a bitter and decades-old territorial dispute between South Korea and Japan. The row escalated in 2012 following a surprise Dokdo visit by then South Korean President Lee Myung-Bak. South Korea defended the drill, involving 19 ships and aircraft, as routine saying it was designed to test their response against a range of threats including North Korea . Relations between the two neighbours are at their lowest ebb for years, largely linked to Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule over the Korean peninsula (pictured, a torpedo is fired) Relations between the two neighbours are currently at their lowest ebb for years, with Washington viewing the rift between its two main Asian military allies with growing alarm. The tensions are largely linked to Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule over the Korean peninsula. Many South Koreans believe Japan has failed to properly atone for abuses carried out during the occupation. The live-fire drill came as Japan began a controversial review of its landmark 1993 apology over the use of many South Korean and Chinese women as wartime sex slaves for its troops. Japan is also embroiled in a territorial dispute with China over a separate set of islands in the East China Sea. The Japanese coastguard said two Chinese coastguard vessels had encroached Friday within the 12-nautical-mile band around one of the Senkaku islands, which China also claims and calls the Diaoyus.","South Korea holds rare live-fire drill with 19 ships and aircraft .

"By . Neil Sears . There was finally some good World Cup news for England last night. Sadly, it did not come from Brazil, where our footballers’ have lost their first two qualifying games. Instead, it was at the rugby Junior World Championships in Auckland, New Zealand, where England’s Under-20s triumphed over South Africa to retain the title they had won in France last year. Dressing room heroes: England's Aaron Morris, Nathan Earle and Maro Itoje . In action: Tom Woolstencroft of England makes a break during the final of the Junior World Championships . Yesterday’s game ended 21-20, with a nail-biting finish which would have been familiar to football fans – except that it ended with our team’s victory. Commentators praised England’s defence and attack, with tries from our promising young players Nathan Earle and Joe Conlon as the team came from behind to beat the South Africans. Jubilant Gloucester fly-half Billy Burns, who scored two penalties and a conversion for England, said after the match: ‘Absolutely buzzing. 'Obviously that last 20 minutes was real nail-biting and to get through it is a massive achievement and full credit to the boys, we deserved that. Winners: Woolstencroft fends against Andre Esterhuizen of South Africa. The nail-biting game - held in Auckland, New Zealand, finished in a 21-20 victory for England . Victory: Billy Burns of England makes a break. The team were praised for their defence and attack by commentators watching the final . ‘We’ve worked hard all campaign, it’s been tough but to come through and win something like that at the end of it just shows how hard we’ve worked, so it’s real satisfying.’ Burns is the younger brother of Freddie Burns, who is due to line up for the senior England side in the third Test against the All Blacks in New Zealand, today. His father’s side have lost the first two Tests. Their success came as England crashed out of the world cup. Fans were left in ruins once more after Costa Rica upset the odds by beating Italy 1-0 - condemning Roy Hodgson's men to an early World Cup exit. In their worst performance in the tournament since 1958 - losses to Italy and Uruguay in their first two fixtures mean they will be leaving Brazil before the knockout stages. Their future in the tournament was left hanging by a thread last night after Luis Suarez led the South American side to a 2-1 win in Sao Paulo - leaving England bottom of Group D. Final: Maro Itoje and Nathan Earle of England celebrate their victory. Promising player Earle was praised for his scoring a try during the epic last match of the competition . Their fate was still in the balance today, but Bryan Ruiz's 44th minute header led Costa Rica to a shock 1-0 win against the Italians. A victory for the Azul would have given England a glimmer of hope going into their final fixture - but the result leaves it mathematically impossible for them to qualify. The nation has spent months watching football-themed adverts, seeing streets and shops taken over by St George's flags, and hearing hours of punditry explaining why this could be England's year. But after just two group games in Brazil, Three Lions fans were left with that all too familiar feeling of anti-climax this morning, as they woke to hangovers following yet another night of bitter disappointment. Celebration: England players take pictures in the dressing room retaining their title . Former captain Rio Ferdinand accepts a 'naive' England did not deserve to stay in the World Cup, but is confident the young squad will grow stronger from the disappointment of Brazil 2014. 'The World Cup for me would have been a better place with England in it, but you have to earn the right to stay in a tournament. Unfortunately for us, we have not done that, Ferdinand said on BBC One. 'Maybe we were a bit naive in situations, in the game yesterday when we got back into it at 1-1, we had a chance to get a point and dust ourselves down, to say 'right, we are ready for the last game when everything is going to be on it,' but we did not give ourselves the opportunity.'","England's Under-20s triumphed at Junior World Championships .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Dr Nurpur Mittal, arriving for sentencing at Canterbury Crown Court yesterday, after being convicted of stealing money from a patient's handbag . A GP who stole money from a mother’s purse during an appointment for her sick baby was fined £5,000 yesterday and now faces being struck off. Dr Nurpur Mittal, 33, took £130 cash from Kelly Wissenden’s purse after the mother-of-two left the consultation room to obtain a specimen from her nine-month-old son Zaio Headley. Miss Wissenden, 29, said she thought it was ‘odd’ when she returned and saw Dr Mittal ‘fiddling around’ in her bag, which she had left on her child’s buggy in the doctor’s room. But she only realised the money was missing when she checked the purse as she left White Cliffs Medical Centre in Dover, Kent. It emerged in court that Dr Mittal had previously been given a ‘fiscal warning’ for shoplifting in Scotland. She now faces the possibility of being struck off the medical register as she will be ordered to appear before a General Medical Council disciplinary board. And she was warned yesterday by Judge James O’Mahony at Canterbury Crown Court that she will be sent to jail if she doesn’t pay the fine within six months. Dr Mittal, from Shepherdswell, near Dover, was convicted of theft by a jury last month. Judge O’Mahony told her: ‘This is a sad state of affairs. ‘A patient has the right to expect that the last person in the world who would steal from them was  a doctor.’ The court heard that Miss Wissenden was intending to use the money to pay for repairs to her car. Andrew Forsyth, prosecuting, said: 'Miss Wissenden later described seeing Dr Mittal fiddling around near the change bag and the buggy, looking very flustered. 'She thought it strange at the time but didn't say anything.' After checking her bag outside and finding the money had gone missing, she returned inside the surgery and told the receptionist Christine Button about her cash disappearing from her purse. Dr Mittal stole the cash from Kelly Wissenden, pictured, when she attended an appointment with her son Zaio Headley at the White Cliffs Medical Centre in Dover . She said they searched the doctor's room and the changing area where they had taken her son but did not find anything. However, after following Dr Mittal's advice, they returned a short while later and found the cash on the floor of the changing room. Miss Wissenden phoned the police later that day to report the doctor and what had happened. The court was told Dr Mittal phoned Miss Wissenden later that evening asking her to withdraw the theft allegation. Dr Mittal, from Shepherdswell, near Dover, was convicted of theft by a jury last month after she had denied the charge. Before sentencing Dr Mittal, he asked for a report about her mental state as he could not understand why someone who 'probably receives a healthy salary' would want to steal £130. The theft took place at White Cliff's Medical Centre in Dover, pictured, and Dr Mittal's name has been removed from the website as a list of doctors practicing at the centre . The court also heard yesterday that Dr Mittal was married but her husband is filing for divorce from her. Her name has been taken off the website list of doctors practising at the White Cliffs Medical Centre in Dover. Yesterday the practice manager at the medical centre said they did not want to comment. After the court hearing, Miss Wissenden, who works as a stewardess for P&O Ferries, said: 'It's really shocking, it's horrible. 'I put my faith in her, my son's life was in her hands and she stole from me. 'It's been such a stressful time. The reaction you get when you tell people is 'really, but she's a doctor?'. 'The barrister even told me to expect a not guilty verdict because the jury was more likely to believe a doctor over me.'","Dr Nurpur Mittal, 33, took £130 cash from Kelly Wissenden's purse .

"By . Adam Crafton . Follow @@AdamCrafton_ . Six years have now passed since the Champions League final hosted two English teams and 10 English players in the glittering Luzhniki Stadium. These days, such an event would feel an outer-world experience, as though an illusion that this nation could ever enjoy such worldly superiority as it did when Manchester United and Chelsea slugged it out on that dramatic night in Moscow. English clubs have had their moments since, Chelsea battling courageously and improbably to win the competition in 2012, but recent years have been exercises in containment, rigidity, ill-discipline and usually, hard-luck stories. VIDEO Scroll down to see Steven Gerrard reveal he is ""broken"" my World Cup failure . Gone: England have been eliminated from the 2014 World Cup after losing their first two Group D matches . Minority: Joe Hart (left) and Gary Cahill (right) were two of just four England players, starting against Uruguay, who played Champions League football last season . Chelsea against Atletico Madrid, Arsenal against Bayern Munch, Manchester United against Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. Three English semi-finalists in three consecutive seasons between 2006 and 2009, playing a confident and dominant brand of football now feels a lifetime away. It is as though English teams no longer feel comfortable in their own skin, reverting only to stifling tactics on the showpiece occasion. Now, finally challenged to rediscover an attacking verve, the England team went gung-ho, liberating the restraint that has strangled the national culture in recent years. History: Six years have passed since two English team battled it out for the Champions League in 2008 . Failed: Roy Hodgson (left) and Steven Gerrard were unable to lead the Three Lions into the World Cup last 16 . Sidelines: 11 players in the England squad to played in the Champions League last season but five haven't kicked a ball in Brazil . It may explain the giddinness and . faltering concentration that engulfed Roy Hodgson's side following . equalisers in both matches, almost as though many of these players were . on work experience before the main event in two years. It is a . very sad time for English football when a World Cup in Brazil - a once . in a life-time opportunity for many of us, we would presume - is tossed . away so liberally. England . should have done more. Uruguay had been beaten by Bolivia, Costa Rica . and even those whipping boys Spain in the past couple of years. Italy . went into this World Cup on the back of draws with Armenia, Denmark, . Luxembourg and Nigeria. The . debate will rage over whether England underperformed or whether this is . simply an England team that does not possess the requisite pedigree for . the world stage. It may well be a bit of both. Consider this for a . moment: just four of the players that started the match against Uruguay . have started a Champions League match in the last two seasons. The . Premier League is a fine breeding ground but it simply does not provide . that very same brutal induction into the unforgiving and ruthless . nature of football at the highest level. England conceded goals from a . corner and a goal-kick at this World Cup, the final blow from Luis . Suarez a goal transplanted from the Hackney Marshes scrapbook for its . amateurish, child-like simplicity. Learning curve: The likes of Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw have just 10 England caps between them . Experience: All 11 of Germany's starting line-up against Ghana were in the Champions League last season . Dip: Could the Three Lions be suffering from English team's poor performances in Europe? Look elsewhere at this World Cup and it becomes clear that major European experience is needed. Taking into account the most recent starting XIs selected, England possess less players from last season's Champions League than Holland, Portugal, Brazil, France, Belgium, Italy, Argentina and Germany. On Saturday, Argentina started with eight, Germany with all eleven. Of course, there are no guarantees. Spain's entire squad of 23 participated in last season's Champions League and they are on the first plane home. Then again, they can take comfort in two European Championships and a World Cup in the last six years. Louis van Gaal's exciting Holland squad has just nine Champions League players in their 23-man squad but in Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Nigel de Jong, they arguably have the form players in the world at this moment. England's finest never threatened to reach such a level. Mistake? Chelsea duo Frank Lampard (left) and Ashley Cole have years of Champions League experience but the latter wasn't even selected by Hodgson . Ever-present: Chelsea have been the only English team to perform in the Champions League and won the competition in 2012 . Even amongst those who have dined on the continent's top table in recent times, question marks remain. Of . the starters against Uruguay, Wayne Rooney is England's best but he has . scored just three Champions League goals in the last two seasons and . has not inscribed his name into a knockout match since Manchester United . 2011 final defeat by Barcelona. Danny Welbeck has his qualities but he . will never decide a football match alone. Gary Cahill is not the same . player without John Terry beside him. Joe Hart's Manchester City have barely been exposed to the knockout-stages of the European competition. Not good enough: Manchester United were knocked out of the Champions League by Bayern Munich . Stalwarts: Arsenal have qualified for the Champions League for the 17th consecutive year but the Gunners are yet to win the trophy . So maybe there should be little surprise that for all England's flirtation with attacking aspiration - and that is all it was, a shimmy across the dance floor, an awkward chat-up line and then the abrupt put-down - England rarely appeared at ease at this World Cup, rarely in control of their own fate. Once again, England gave notice that they fear, rather than relish, such a stellar stage, frightened to seize the occasion in the way that the Chileans, Ghanians and Costa Rican's have done. The hazard signs have been flashing for some time now, the European malaise now reflected in a national team that is shorn of quality, devoid of self-belief and happy to do little more than hop along for the ride. The manager and players will bristle at the suggestion but the noises from the FA - Alex Horne suggesting that mere qualification for the World Cup constitutes success, Greg Dyke irritatingly backing Hodgson on the day England exited the competition - only contributes to the feeling that English football increasingly appears to be apathetic, out of ideas, and suffering yet another crisis of confidence. Pedigree: 65.2% of the Brazil World Cup squad took part in Europe's biggest competition last season . Regular: Eight of Argentina's starting 11 against Iran could draw from Champions League football in 2013/14 . Exception: All 23 players in the Spain squad played Champions League football last season, but that didn't stop La Roja from crashing out of the World Cup . Goodbye: Sergio Ramos (left) and Diego Costa stand dejected at Spain are knocked out of the World Cup .","Only four players in England's starting line-up against Uruguay took part in Champions League football last season .

"By . Sean Poulter . Sainsbury's is to take on Aldi and Lidl at their own game by bringing Netto discount food stores back to Britain . The exodus of middle income families to the thriving budget chains ended almost ten years of growth for Sainsbury’s and its response is to take a 50 per cent share in new Netto stores in partnership with Danish owners Dansk Supermarked. The first Netto will open in the north of England this year with plans for 15 by the end of 2015, potentially followed by hundreds more. Discount supermarket Netto is to make a return to the UK as part of a joint venture with Sainsbury's that will take on booming rivals Aldi and Lidl . Netto moved into the UK in 1990 and . built up a network of nearly 200 stores in less affluent areas. But it . exited in 2010, selling the premises to Asda in a £778million deal that . was seen as evidence that discount chains could not survive against the . financial muscle of the big four – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and . Morrisons. But the tables . have been turned in spectacular style. Now, it is the big four that are . losing billions of pounds in sales to Aldi, which is growing at more . than 35 per cent a year, and Lidl, where sales are rising by more than . 20 per cent. Aldi has 500 . outlets and is opening new stores at the rate of more than one a week . and Lidl is also expanding at a breakneck pace. The UK discount sector . is forecast to double in size to an annual £20billion sales in the next . five years. The big four supermarkets - Sainsbury's, Morissons, Asda and Tesco - are in the middle of a price war as their market shares are squeezed between discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl and upmarket rival Waitrose . Sainsbury’s and . Dansk are each initially investing £12.5million in the venture. However, . Jon Copestake, retail analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said . the UK relaunch of Netto, which operates in a number of European . countries, was not without risk. ‘Consumer . austerity has carved out a growing market share for discounters such as . Lidl or Aldi and both Netto and Sainsbury’s will be keen to tap into . this trend,’ he said. ‘However, . Netto is entering a very different market to the one it left. Aldi and . Lidl have expanded aggressively and established themselves as viable . alternatives to mid-market retailers on both price and quality.’ The . Netto outlets will be more upmarket than previous stores, with a focus . on fresh food and an in-house bakery offering premium Danish breads and . pastries. ■ It has been praised for its cut-price lobster and champagne, but Aldi has flopped with a much more modest product.

"By . Helen Carroll . Most mornings, Saskia Pearson’s ten-year-old son would awake groggy and bleary-eyed and announce to his mum: ‘I need a coffee.’ It was an astonishing start to the day for such a young boy, but what is more incredible still is that Jake’s caffeine dependency had developed at a Costa Coffee outlet in a local school. Jake, now 12, was at the time a pupil at an independent primary school in Hampstead, North London, and would visit friends on his way home at the nearby private University College School, which is one of 70 schools with its own Costa Coffee concession or vending machines. Students at Wren Academy Sixth Form building in North London queue up for their caffeine fix. More than 70 schools across the country now have such outlets . ‘The Costa Bar is in the school’s sports centre, which is open after school while there are clubs and activities going on,’ says Saskia. ‘He and his friends saw the bigger children drinking coffee and it became the “cool” thing to do. Strictly speaking, the coffee bar is for sixth-formers and people using the sports centre, but I don’t think anyone checks, especially after school. ‘So he started drinking lattes and cappuccinos. At first I thought it was all right as an occasional treat but after a while I realised that it was getting out of control. He was acting like a stressed-out adult. I put a stop to it right away.’ Saskia, 35, is angry at what she sees as the cynical exploitation of children by Costa, which last year made more than £807 million and is opening coffee shops in the UK at the rate of three a week. ‘Jake would never have got into drinking coffee at such a young age if the Costa concession hadn’t been in a school,’ says Saskia. ‘School should be a safe place, not one where big businesses can promote unhealthy products to children.’ So how has this sudden surge in coffee bar concessions in schools come about? While parents who can afford private education have the choice to opt for schools without ready access to caffeine-laden Americanos, those with children in state schools do not. Pupils at University College School, Hampstead, pictured, can buy Costa in the sports centre - which is open after school hours for clubs and activities . There are a number of state schools with Costa outlets including Hadley Learning Community in Telford, Shropshire; Hinchingbrooke School in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire; Appleton School in Benfleet, Essex; Greenford High in West London; Wren Academy in North London; Highams Park School in East London; Xaverian College in Manchester; and North Durham Academy in Stanley, County Durham. In most cases they are introduced by catering companies, such as Sodexo and Chartwells, which provide school meals. These firms pay to become Costa franchisees and, in turn, make money from selling coffee in schools. It is unclear whether the schools themselves profit. It’s a particularly attractive proposition, not least because the products sold are 20 per cent cheaper than on the High Street, owing to their VAT exemption as they’re being served to children. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Costa says it has ‘seen an increase  in the number of [school] catering teams approaching us directly.’ ‘In all instances the college, school or their caterer will come to us,’ a spokesman said. According to new figures from parent company Whitbread, Costa Enterprises, the branch which includes its coffee business, has seen sales rise by 18.5  per cent to £79.5 million in the first quarter of this year. State school Hinchingbrooke School in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire is another institution with a Costa Coffee machine. In most cases, they are introduced by catering companies, such as Sodexo and Chartwells, which provide school meals . Paul Stafford, from the British Franchise Association, says that, aside from raising the company’s profile among coffee drinkers of the future, the benefit to Costa is the money it makes from selling its franchise to catering companies that supply the schools. The caterers are also obliged to buy raw materials from Costa. ‘Any profits made from the outlet would usually go straight to the catering company as franchisee,’ says Mr Stafford. So what’s in it for the schools? A Sodexo spokeswoman says coffee outlets in schools are an ‘emerging trend’ because ‘schools encourage their sixth-form students to remain in school when they have breaks. ‘Sodexo has a wholesale agreement with Costa which enables the company to serve Costa products. We are provided with everything from the machines, beans, milk and cups.’ She didn’t know what profit they would make from Costa bars in schools but ‘it’s not something we would comment on’. She also said she didn’t know how or if the profits were split between the school, the catering company and Costa. Dr . Antony Faccinello is senior deputy head of Alleyn’s, a smart private . school in South London. He says the outlet at his school has proved . popular with adults visiting the theatre that is also housed on site, as . well as with sixth-formers and younger pupils who may visit after . school. He insists, however, that the outlet doesn’t raise any additional money for the school. Figures from parent company Whitbread suggest Costa Enterprises, the branch which includes its coffee business, has seen sales rise by 18.5¿¿per cent to £79.5¿million in the first quarter of this year . ‘A parent asked me on open day whether it was ethical to have a company like Costa in our school,’ says Dr Faccinello. ‘I think that if you are going to drink coffee, then you might as well drink a decent brand. ‘Our Costa was set up when we built a new theatre which is used by students as well as the general public. It’s a good facility. ‘We do monitor the pupils carefully, however, to make sure that they don’t buy more than two per day. The younger pupils tend to buy hot chocolate and cookies. We are also looking at a policy whereby the older pupils can only buy caffeinated drinks in the morning. After first break they would have to have decaf.’ One of the secrets of Costa’s success must certainly be excellent forward planning. Already an unmissable presence in garages, service stations and hospitals, the company appears to have turned its attention to the youngest and most impressionable members of society. Paul Kilvington, owner of The Branding Experts, which works with some of Britain’s top independent schools, says he would advise clients considering an outlet to ‘proceed with caution’. Experts say the company's move in to schools is to ensure brand loyalty at an early age (library image) ‘Why is Costa keen to get in schools? Effectively it is a marketing exercise to build brand loyalty,’ says Mr Kilvington. ‘If children drink Costa at school, they are more likely to choose Costa over the competition.’ Fiona Spotswood, a lecturer in the Business School at the University of the West of England, who has researched marketing to children, agrees. ‘What Costa is trying to do here is secure loyal customers at a ridiculously early age,’ says Ms Spotswood. ‘There has been a lot of research into bank accounts and mobile phones which shows it is effective. ‘Children make a connection between consumption and popularity: You have to wear the right clothes, own the right phone and why not drink the right sort of coffee? ‘This sort of branded marketing is insidious because children don’t have the critical faculties to make informed choices.’ Aside from what critics would regard as blatant exploitation, there is also the implication for health. Astonishingly, it is possible to notch up in excess of 3,000 calories — more than a full day’s allowance for a grown man — in one Costa drink: a large mocha latte with extra cream, syrup and a chocolate flake. In a country with a growing child obesity problem, this is surely a serious concern. Dr Amina Selmi-Aitsi, who specialises in public health and obesity, believes there are ‘alarming ramifications’ to Costa’s presence in our schools. ‘We want children to develop good nutritional habits, so what are we teaching them if we’re selling them sugary coffee?’ she says. ‘We know that coffee can have addictive properties, as does sugar, so this can be a doubly potent drink. ‘If I were a coffee marketer, I would think it genius to get children buying my products so early in their lives.’ Fortunately, Saskia Pearson stepped in before her son became too dependent on coffee, given that caffeine withdrawal can cause symptoms including violent headaches, nausea and the shakes. But other children in state schools up and down the country who are developing expensive habits, courtesy of the taxpayer, may not be so fortunate.

The Chelsea skipper is new to the social media platform with his club team-mate Marco van Ginkel encouraging others to follow the 33-year-old with his message: ‘Follow our captain. New on instagram! John Terry,’ on his own Instagram profile. Terry's personal displays at Chelsea last season warranted some calls from the media for Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson to recall him for this summer's showpiece in Brazil. The defender retired from international duty in September 2012 after winning 78 caps, shortly before he was found guilty by the Football Association of racially abusing QPR's Anton Ferdinand. Despite appeals for his reinstatement Terry was omitted from Hodgson's World Cup squad, with the former Liverpool and Fulham boss choosing his club colleague Gary Cahill, Everton's Phil Jagielka and Manchester United duo Phil Jones and Chris Smalling as his four central defenders in the squad.

One of the offerings is a ‘puerile’ Radio 1 feed from Scott Mills and co-host Chris Stark which has greatly annoyed members of the BBC Sport team in Brazil, who are intent on covering the tournament professionally. The pair’s contribution during the Brazil v Mexico game was called by one insider: ‘The most puerile, childish, pathetic stuff that you could wish to hear. There are 11million watching the game and we’re directing viewers to listen to utter garbage.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch the latest update from Brazil by Charles Sale and Neil Ashton . Controversy: BBC DJ Scott Mills (pictured) and co-host Chris Stark have been criticised by fellow staff for their 'childish' World Cup coverage . On top of that, BBC Sport bosses seem unclear what control they have over red button content with the cringeworthy Radio 1 option appearing higher in the drop-down list than the proper  5 Live commentary. A BBC spokesman said: ‘We are offering the best service we can on all platforms and the Radio 1 audio is for a Radio 1 audience. The guys loved doing it and we may use them again.’ The spokesman was unaware who decides when the Radio 1 feed is used. Not good enough: An insider described the extra audio of Mills and Stark as 'pathetic' during Brazil's 0-0 draw with Mexico . Richard Keys and Andy Gray, the Sky Sports rejects, claim in their risible World Cup diary that your Sports Agenda columnist doesn’t exist.

"By . Simon Watkins . Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in his Mansion House Speech to City dignitaries earlier this month said: 'I want Britain to be not just the western hub of Chinese finance - but of Islamic finance too' The first Islamic government bonds could be issued by the Treasury as early as this week after a roadshow by Whitehall officials in the Middle East  and Asia. The Government plans to raise £200million from the bond issue – the first carried out by a Western country – as part of an effort to make the UK a global hub for Islamic finance. Sharia forbids Muslims earning or paying interest, but carefully designed products avoiding interest payments are widely used in the Islamic world to raise finance within religious rules. Officials . from the Treasury and Britain’s Debt Management Office toured Islamic . cities last week visiting, among others, Jeddah, Dubai, Riyadh and Kuala . Lumpur. A . Treasury spokesman said the meetings with Islamic financiers had been . productive and that there was ‘quite a lot of support’. The bonds - . properly know as Sukuk - could be sold to Islamic investors ‘as early as . next week’. A key deadline is June 29 when the Islamic holy month of . Ramadan begins. The money raised will be repayable in five years. But  instead of interest, bond-buyers will earn rental income from three Government offices. While widely used in many Islamic countries Sukuk is still controversial among some conservative Islamic scholars who regard it as a contrived way of getting round Sharia. The Sukuk is being handled for the UK Treasury by a syndicate of banks led by HSBC. Chancellor George Osborne has made clear his desire for London to be a centre for international finance with a particular focus on the Islamic world and China, an aspiration repeated by the chancellor during last week’s visit by Chinese premier Li Keqiang. David Cameron  greets Chinese Premier Li Keqiang outside 10 Downing Street this week on his first official visit to London .

The trio were spotted at Manchester airport with the rest of the Rooney clan as they prepared to fly out ahead of England's crunch clash against Uruguay on Thursday. Despite Wayne and his teammates losing 2-1 to Italy at the weekend, Coleen looked hopeful of a long stay as she was accompanied by 15 pieces of luggage. Scroll down for video . Excited: Coleen Rooney leads her family through Manchester airport to catch a flight to Brazil for the World Cup .

While Kai and Klay wore matching England kits with their names on the back, Coleen too had her own personally-made Louis Vuitton weekend bag with her initials on the side. Her travel outfit was smart yet casual, opting for a white blazer with black top, faded grey skinny jeans, and finished off with some coloured gem sandals.

Defender: The mother-of-two has been taking on Twitter trolls who have criticised her husband's performance in the England v Italy game . Many took to Twitter to comment on what they thought was a dismal performance by one of the most experienced players in the squad, though he was put out of position to make room for Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling. Coleen wasn’t letting any online trolls get away with the criticism directed at her and her husband, often tweeting profanity to deal with some overzealous haters. The family weren’t able to be in Rio for the first match, but the mother of two guarantees she’ll be cheering Wayne on throughout their campaign, however long that may be. Good luck: No doubt Wayne will be hoping his family's presence will spur him on and not let the critics mess with his head on the pitch . Mascot: Kai wore an England kit with matching Nike trainers and his father's number on the back . Matching: Baby Klay also sported an England kit and his daddy's number . 'We're off!': Coleen shared a cute picture of her and her boys on their way to Brazil .

"Vicente del Bosque has received the backing of the Spanish Football Federation, in spite of Spain's disastrous World Cup campaign which has seen the holders exit the tournament after just two games. The coach is under contract until after the European Championships in 2016 but admitted after Spain's 2-0 defeat to Chile, which followed the humiliating 5-1 thrashing at the hands of Holland, that his future was not certain, saying: 'We need to decide what's best for Spanish football, and that includes myself.' However, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) insist they want the 63-year-old, who has won the World Cup and European Championships with Spain, to stay in charge of La Roja. Vote of confidence: The Spanish FA have given their backing to coach Vicente del Bosque despite the defending champions' early exit from the World Cup . Humbled: Spain were beaten 5-1 by Holland in their opening group match and then lost 2-0 to Chile . 'From top to bottom in the Federation we are all behind Del Bosque,' Jorge Perez, Spain's director of football, told radio station Cope. 'If we have the best coach around, why would we change?' Perez revealed that the Federation preferred not to discuss Del Bosque's future with the coach just yet, and would wait until after Spain's final World Cup game with Australia. End of the world: Spain's Iker Casillas, Andres Iniesta and Fernando Torres trudge off the pitch after the 2-0 defeat by Chile in the Maracana . Not good enough: Koke, Javi Martinez and Raul Albiol reflect on the World Cup exit . 'We still haven't spoken with Del Bosque, it's better to put a bit of distance between us and wait and then speak calmly in Madrid,' he said. 'When Del Bosque signed the contract he said that if there was any motivation that we thought he shouldn't continue, he would leave. But I want him to stay. 'He wont be affected by the criticism. His family might convince him to leave, but we aren't going to find anyone better. Del Bosque has not resigned.

"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . The big players have parked their tanks on Wimbledon’s lawns, with Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal both declaring that they are fit and ready to fire over the next fortnight. The top two seeds issued upbeat assessments of their chances yesterday, with the Serb insisting his wrist is fine and world No 1 Nadal believing he is equipped to avoid the shock exits that have befallen him since 2011. Djokovic missed last month’s Madrid Open with soreness in his wrist that first appeared at the start of the clay court season  and he pulled out of his regular  pre-Wimbledon exhibition at Stoke Park on Thursday as a precaution. Champion: Murray prepares to defend his title at Wimbledon - but the rest of the 'Big Four' are ready too . Look over your shoulder: Murray has a whole host of rivals who have their eye on his Wimbledon crown . He feels going into Wimbledon without any preparation on grass has been a price worth paying because easing himself in appears to have cured the problem. He said: ‘When I was changing surfaces from clay to grass, during the opening few days of practice here, I got a bit of a strange sensation in the wrist. But now it’s fine.’ While Djokovic has been staggeringly consistent at the Grand Slams — he has not lost before the quarter-finals since the French Open five years ago — Nadal has become prone to upsets on the grass. The Serb took some time off in Ibiza after Roland Garros, while Nadal had some downtime at home in Mallorca before coming to London last Wednesday. They both feel it is the right formula for success and in the Spaniard’s case he believes it will lead to him sticking around longer. Nadal is so confident about the state of his body he has stepped up his preparations from previous visits to the All England Club. Watchful eye: Djokovic practices watched over by his coach Boris Becker as he limbers up at SW19 . ‘I’m practising more hours than I usually do,’ he said. ‘It’s positive that my physical level gives me that chance because this is the only tournament where you don’t have weeks of matches to understand how you are playing. ‘It’s the most dangerous tournament of the year. When I arrive at Roland Garros I can more or less imagine how I am going to play. Here the courts are a bit faster at the start and the feeling on court is a little strange for everybody.’ Nadal has the toughest initial draw of any top player, facing the useful Slovakian Martin Klizan in the first round, then possibly his 2012 conqueror Lukas Rosol and potentially the giant-serving Ivo Karlovic. He dismissed any significance in his loss 10 days ago against Dustin Brown in Germany, saying: ‘I am feeling better this year than the past couple. I am able to move more freely, I’m not scared about my knee and that is the most important thing for me. ‘I didn’t play as much as I would like to play on grass for the last couple of years but I am not starting from zero because I have already played a lot on it in my career. ‘But you don’t have much time to control a match on grass, you make two mistakes on your serve and you don’t have much chance to get it back.’ Chilled: Nadal has been out practicing on the outer courts at Wimbledon as he sets his sights on glory . Not wishing to be outdone, Roger Federer was also in confident mood. The great Swiss, who won the German ATP event at Halle, is the fourth favourite for this event as he approaches his 33rd birthday but he questions the relevance of that. ‘I don’t know if it changes a whole lot,’ he said. ‘Sometimes I was the big favourite but if you believe you can win the tournament then you’re just focused on yourself.’ He lost in the second round last year against Sergiy Stakhovsky but now feels able to joke about that result. ‘We can only face each other in the final this year — so it’s all good for both of us,’ he says. Crucially he believes more in himself at Wimbledon: ‘Maybe in Paris it’s slightly dependent on Rafa. Here I feel if I play my game then it’s more on my racket.’ Don't forget me! Federer may be fourth favourite but he is still a tough opponent on grass .","Djokovic and Nadal declare themselves ready to challenge at SW19 .

Upbeat: Adam Gemili believes Great Britain can challenge Jamaica and the USA . The 20-year-old, one of nine British men to have dipped under 10.2secs for 100m already this season, said: 'Everyone in British sprinting is running ridiculously quick at the moment.

He said: 'At the trials and European Champs I'll probably do the 200m as I'm already selected for the 100m at the Commonwealth Games. It's a long season as there are only eight days between the Commonwealths and Europeans.

Ms Bishop's comments come after a chilling video was released by the extreme terrorist group, Insurgent group Islamic State in Iraq and Levant (ISIL), also known as ISIS, with Australians calling on their fellow countrymen to join them in their fight in Syria and Iraq. She said the Government was aware Australians were heading to both Syria and Iraq to join up with jihadist groups, putting the number of those already involved in the fighting at 150. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says the government is working to prevent Australian jihadists returning home with 'new-found abilities and talents in terrorism' US President Barack Obama shares Julie Bishop's concern about the threat posed by returning jihadists. 'We are particularly concerned with the reports of Australians who are heading off not only to train, but to take leadership roles in radicalising others,"" she told ABC television on Sunday. 'The fear is they will come back to Australia with these new-found abilities and talents in terrorism. US President Barack Obama shared similar concern about the threat posed by returning jihadists. 'Our National Security Committee is discussing this matter, and we are working out ways to ensure that Australians are safe from what I find to be a deeply disturbing development in our domestic security' - Julie Bishop . 'There is no doubt the problem in Syria is one that we have been paying a lot of attention to over the last couple of years as you see jihadists coming in from Europe and as far as Australia to get trained and then going back into their home countries,' he told CNN. Ms Bishop said the overseas insurgents' activities were being monitored and assessed all the time, and the government was 'ever vigilant' to ensure Australians were kept safe from the threat posed by returning fighters. All ministers, agencies and departments were involved in seeking to solve this problem, she said as the government had already cancelled a number of passports. 'We are doing what we can across government - it is a topic that is engaging the Australian government at every level,' Ms Bishop said. 'Our National Security Committee is discussing this matter, and we are working out ways to ensure that Australians are safe from what I find to be a deeply disturbing development in our domestic security.'

The 13-minute recruitment video titled, There Is No Life Without Jihad, shows five extremists urging people to 'respond to Allah' and 'wake up and be part of the effort'. Two of the militants are thought to be Australian, and one who is identified as Brother Abu Yahya ash Shami and speaks with a strong Australian accent is believed to have been killed shortly after the taping.

"Tony Gwynn, the Hall of Famer with a sweet left-handed swing who spent his entire 20-year career with the Padres and was one of San Diego's most beloved athletes, died of cancer Monday. He was 54. Gwynn, nicknamed 'Mr. Padre,' had been on a medical leave since late March from his job as baseball coach at San Diego State, his alma mater. He died at a hospital in suburban Poway, agent John Boggs said. San Diego Padres' Tony Gwynn pictured here in the final game of his career, died of cancer on Monday at the age of 54 . In a rarity in pro sports, Gwynn played his whole career with the Padres retiring in 2001 . 'For more than 30 years, Tony Gwynn . was a source of universal goodwill in the national pastime, and he will . be deeply missed by the many people he touched,' Commissioner Bud Selig . said. Gwynn had two operations for cancer in his right cheek between August 2010 and February 2012. The second surgery was complicated, with surgeons removing a facial nerve because it was intertwined with a tumor inside his right cheek. They grafted a nerve from Gwynn's neck to help him eventually regain facial movement. Gwynn had said he believed the cancer was from chewing tobacco. San Francisco Giants third base coach Tim Flannery played a long time with Gwynn and then coached him. Flannery says he'll 'remember the cackle to his laugh. He was always laughing, always talking, always happy.' 'The baseball world is going to miss one of the greats, and the world itself is going to miss one of the great men of mankind,' Flannery said. 'He cared so much for other people. He had a work ethic unlike anybody else, and had a childlike demeanor of playing the game just because he loved it so much.' In a rarity in pro sports, Gwynn played his whole career with the Padres, choosing to stay rather than leaving for bigger paychecks elsewhere. His terrific hand-eye coordination made him one of the game's greatest contact hitters. Gwynn had said he believed the cancer that took his life was from chewing tobacco . He had 3,141 hits, a career .338 average and won eight NL batting titles. He excelled at hitting singles the other way, through the '5.5 hole' between third base and shortstop. Gwynn played in the Padres' only two World Series and was a 15-time All-Star. He homered off the facade at Yankee Stadium off San Diego native David Wells in Game 1 of the 1998 World Series and scored the winning run in the 1994 All-Star Game. He was hitting .394 when a players' strike ended the 1994 season, denying him a shot at becoming the first player to hit .400 since San Diego native Ted Williams hit .406 in 1941. Gwynn befriended Williams and the two loved to talk about hitting. Gwynn steadied Williams when he threw out the ceremonial first pitch before the 1999 All-Star Game at Boston's Fenway Park. Gwynn retired after the 2001 season. He and Cal Ripken Jr. — who spent his entire career with the Baltimore Orioles — were inducted into the Hall of Fame in the class of 2007. Gwynn was a two-sport star at San Diego State in the late 1970s-early 1980s, playing point guard for the basketball team — he still holds the game, season and career record for assists — and outfielder for the baseball team. Gwynn always wanted to play in the NBA, until realizing during his final year at San Diego State that baseball would be the ticket to the pros. He had 3,141 hits, a career .338 average and won eight NL batting titles over his career . 'I had no idea that all the things in my . career were going to happen,' he said shortly before being inducted into . the Hall of Fame along with Ripken in 2007. 'I sure didn't see it. I . just know the good Lord blessed me with ability, blessed me with good . eyesight and a good pair of hands, and then I worked at the rest.' He was a third-round draft pick of the Padres in 1981. After spending parts of just two seasons in the minor leagues, he made his big league debut on July 19, 1982. Gwynn had two hits that night, including a double, against the Philadelphia Phillies. After doubling, Pete Rose, who had been trailing the play, said to Gwynn: ""Hey, kid, what are you trying to do, catch me in one night?"" Survivors include his wife, Alicia, daughter Anisha and son Tony Jr., who plays with the Philadelphia Phillies.","Died of cancer on Monday at the age of 54 .

"By . Leesa Smith . The bizarre life of internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom continues with strangers invited to  a spontaneous pool party at his New Zealand mansion to celebrate the All Blacks victory which ran until the crack of dawn. The eccentric German millionaire, who now resides in Auckland, sent out a tweet before the All Blacks versus England match on Saturday, declaring if the New Zealand rugby team won he would ‘walk into a random bar in Auckland & pickup 20 ppl for a 38 degree pool party at the mansion.’ Predicting the team’s victory before the siren, the Internet Party founder sent a follow-up tweet saying the party was going ahead and asking for suggestions of bars to go to for the ‘victory pool party pickup.’ Kim Dotcom (pictured with friends aboard a yacht in the British Virgin Islands in 2012) is quite partial to announcing a spontaneous pool party via Twitter - the internet mogul has held two in the past two years . The founder of Mega, a file hosting service, then invited another 20 random punters to message him directly for the ‘secret mansion security password’ to gain VIP access to the party'. Just before midnight, Dotcom arrived at 1885 in Auckland's Britomart precinct in a 4WD Mercedes with black tinted windows to whisk three women back to his Coatesville mansion, The New Zealand Herald reported. The newly-single Dotcom, who is a father of five, was seen posing for selfies while the crowd cheered him on. A tweet during the evening from the mogul suggested that noise complaints had been made: ‘Turn't down for what?! #PoolParty #AllBlacks #Whaaaat’ The wild bash wound up at 5am on Sunday with Dotcom tweeting: ‘he had a great night with total strangers who became friends. #Happiness’ As irony would have it, Ben Smith, an IT worker with the same name as the All Blacks wing player, was one of the lucky VIP guests; ‘Off to @KimDotcom mansion to party to celebrate the All Blacks win later on tonight! How exciting!’ But not everyone was quite so lucky to be a guest of Dotcom, who changed his name from Schmitz in 2005, with a few international followers expressing wishing to have Kiwi nationalities. While Matt Adams tweeted that he was ‘gutted’ that he missed the shindig and asked him to have a party in London next time.

Kim Dotcom's new-found friends were recruited from Twitter and a bar in Auckland's Britomart precinct . Meanwhile, Dotcom tweeted two hours later about the ‘great news’ that his four Filipina nannies to his five children, including twin girls, had received a 12 month extension on their works visas, in the same week Dotcom announced the end of his five-year marriage to Mona. This is just yet another colourful chapter in the life of Dotcom who received a suspended prison sentence in Germany in 1994 for computer fraud and data espionage, and another suspended prison sentence in 2003 for insider trading and embezzlement. New Zealand Police placed him in custody in  January 2012 in response to US charges of criminal copyright infringement in relation to his Megaupload website. Dotcom was accused of costing the entertainment industry $500 million through pirated content uploaded to his file-sharing site. He has vigorously denied the charges, and is fighting the attempt to extradite him to the United States.

"By . Mike Dawes . Reece Lyne's late try made the difference as Wakefield Trinity Wildcats stunned defending First Utility Super League champions Wigan to record their first win over the Warriors since 2009. A youthful Wigan side without the likes of Sean O'Loughlin, John Bateman and Matty Bowen played their part in an excellent match but ultimately fell to a 36-28 defeat. Wakefield edged an entertaining first half which swung one way then the other thanks to tries from Danny Kirmond, Tim Smith, Richard Owen and Richard Moore. Jack Hughes, Liam Farrell and Anthony Gelling crossed during a purple patch for Wigan, who had the first word in the second period as Farrell went over again. Paul Sykes made it five from five with the boot to give the Wildcats the lead but it was short-lived, Dan Sarginson putting Wigan back in the box seat. Purple patch: Jack Hughes bursts away from the defence to score during a spell of Wigan dominance . Danny Washbrook's try moved Wakefield back ahead and Lyne went over four minutes from time to claim the win and knock Wigan off top spot. Warriors hooker George Williams went closest to breaking the deadlock after a tight opening 15 minutes when he was adjudged to have knocked the ball on reaching for the line. It was Wakefield who took the lead as Kirmond took a short ball from Tim Smith close to the Warriors line and crashed over. The Wildcats were almost in again from the restart but Chris Riley was unable to hold onto the ball after a break by Lyne. Riley's error proved costly as Hughes took a flat pass from Matty Smith and showed a good turn of pace to beat Richard Mathers to the line. Wigan were in again from the restart courtesy of Liam Farrell's try on the back of a surging run by Jack Murphy, who was making his first appearance of the season. It looked as if the writing was on the wall for Wakefield when Gelling showed good athleticism to collect Matty Smith's high kick and touch down. Wigan-bound Taulima Tautai was on receiving end of a dangerous tackle by Liam Farrell in an incident which saw the Warriors forward put on report and Wakefield took full advantage as Tim Smith jinked his way over. The hosts were back on level terms when Skyes converted after Owen finished from 40 metres out following a bit of magic by Pita Godinet. Wakefield had the momentum and they retook the lead on the stroke of half-time when Moore crashed onto Godinet's pass from dummy half to power over. Tautai was denied a try at the start of the second half after referee George Stokes penalised the Wildcats for obstruction and they were quickly on the back foot, Liam Farrell crossing for his second try after half-backs Matty Smith and Sam Powell combined. A Sykes penalty edged Wakefield ahead with just over a quarter of the game to go but Wigan were back in front when Sarginson showed good footwork to score. Matty Smith's missed conversion ensured Wakefield had only a two-point deficit, which was wiped out thanks to Washbrook's close-range effort. Sykes missed a straightforward conversion before Murphy had a try ruled out for a forward pass. Wakefield decided against going for goal after a high tackle by Matty Smith and that decision was vindicated as Lyne finished on the back of a good offload by Sykes, who converted to seal a famous win.","Late try sees Wakefield beat Wigan for first time in five years .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It is loved worldwide for its humour but The Simpsons also contains more hardcore maths than most people realise, an academic has suggested. The hit TV show contains more maths-related gags than any other prime time TV programme, according to Simon Singh, an author who specialises in writing about scientific and mathematical topics. He said that the jokes, which usually appear in background shots or in a single frame, are mainly the work of two of the show's writers, Mike Reiss and Al Jean. Scroll down for video . The hit TV show contains more maths-related gags than any other TV programme, according to Simon Singh . The duo, who have worked on the series since it began, first met at Harvard University. 'They put maths in the show as a way of expressing their love of maths,' Mr Singh said. Speaking at the Sunday Times Festival of Education at Wellington College in Berkshire, he said that over the years, numerous mathematical concepts have appeared in the show. One episode, about Lisa running a baseball team, contained a shot of a book bearing Euler's equation Mr Singh said, which is seen by many mathematicians as one of the most beautiful equations because it contains a number of key maths elements including zero and one. The first ever episode of the show included a joke about calculus, he added. And while he is not known for his intelligence, Homer Simpson has also played his part in subtly imparting some mathematical knowledge. Mr Singh said writers Mike Reiss and Al Jean 'put maths in the show as a way of expressing their love of maths' In an episode where he attempting to be an inventor, Homer is seen scribbling a number of equations on a blackboard, one of which relates to the mass of the Higgs boson. Mr Singh also told the festival that the name of Springfield's cinema, the Googolplex, is a nod to the mathematical term 'googol' - the definition of 10 raised to the power of 100. He said: 'It's never been a secret. The writers are very proud of what they've done. 'They've hidden the maths away because they don't want to scare people but they're really happy for people to find out about it.'","Show contains more maths gags than any other programme, expert says .

"By . Leesa Smith . and Aap . Retiring Liberal senator Sue Boyce has gone out with a bang - labelling Prime Minister Tony Abbott as a ‘sexist’ and accusing the Opposition of ‘dog whistling’ with its asylum seeker policies. Speaking on her departure from federal parliament at the end of the month after seven years, Senator Boyce told the Sydney Morning Herald she thought Julia Gillard's famous misogyny speech was ‘powerful’ and within context, ‘brilliant’. Although, the former Liberal Women's Council president said Mr Abbott would have been better described by Ms Gillard as a ‘subtle sexist’ - one of many in federal politics. Scroll down for video . Retiring Liberal senator Sue Boyce has  labelled Prime Minister Tony Abbott as a 'subtle sexist' But Senator Boyce, a former journalist and public relations practitioner, conceded that Mr Abbott had been more willing to listen to women's views than many of her male colleagues during her time in office. Some of the opposition's older MPs still ‘yearned for the life when proper mothers stayed home and looked after the children and proper fathers who had their slippers handed to them’, the mother-of -three said. Senator Boyce said she was also concerned by the government swinging too far to the right, particularly on issues such as asylum seekers, action against climate change and same-sex marriage. ‘I think the whole asylum seeker issue is sort of fraught with dog whistling,’ she said, adding that she did not appreciate the language used by Immigration Minister Scott Morrison, particularly the term ‘illegal maritime arrivals’. Meanwhile, Ms Gillard discussed on the Diane Rehm radio show in America what her reasoning was in deciding to deliver the 'misogyny speech' to parliament in October 2012. But Senator Boyce conceded that Mr Abbott was more willing to listen to women's views than many of her male colleagues during her time in office . 'I think for me, the sense that after everything that I as the first woman prime minister had seen happen around me about gender and to me in that position, I was not going to stand there and get lectured about sexism.' Ms Gillard said she had the opportunity, as Australia’s first female prime minister, to discuss sexism with other female heads of state, including Hillary Clinton. 'I think for men, that conversation starts with: ""What kind of leader will he be? Strong? Weak? Compassionate? Strident?"" And for women it starts with: ""Can she lead?"" and it's a subtle but significant difference,' she said. 'Yes we have talked about those things, Hillary and I, and I've had the opportunity to talk to some other leading women around the world about them.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Grumpy and miserable people in the workplace are more productive, according to a new study . He or she may not be the most popular person in the workplace, but your grumpy colleague may just be the person to turn to when a task needs completing. Researchers say workers described as ‘haters’ are more focused because they spend a lot of time on fewer activities. It means they are good at their job because they hone their skills in specific tasks. However, those seen as the life and soul of the workplace – ‘likers’ – spread themselves more thinly, possibly making them less productive employees. The findings, from researchers at the Universities of Illinois and Pennsylvania and published in the journal Social Psychology, may have implications for understanding the development of expertise. Participants in the study reported their activities over a week and also completed a measure of ‘dispositional attitudes’ – how they reacted to various situations. Although haters and likers did not differ in the types of activities they pursued, the former tended to do fewer. Likers may have difficulty sustaining attention on a task because they perceive so many interesting opportunities in their environment. To prove their point, in two studies participants reported all their activities over a week and also completed a measure of dispositional attitudes. Although haters and likers did not differ in the types of activities they pursued, the former tended to do fewer throughout the period. Almost 15 percent of the differences in how many activities people conducted was associated with their personality. However, those seen as the life and soul of the workplace spread themselves more thinly, says the study . Haters and likers also did not differ in how much time they spent on them, just the number they managed. As a result, haters spent more time on any given activity. So, compared with likers, haters would be characterised as less active because they do fewer things, or as more focused because they spend more time on the small number of things they do. Dr Hepler said: “The present results demonstrate that patterns of general action may occur for reasons other than the desire to be active versus inactive. 'Indeed, some people may be more active than others not because they want to be active per se, but because they identify a large number of specific behaviours in which they want to engage.' They added likers may have more difficulty sustaining attention on a task because they perceive so many interesting and distracting opportunities in their environment. In contrast, because haters like so few things, they may be unlikely to be distracted when they are doing a task, and thus their generalized dislike may actually benefit their attention .","Grumpy workers are more productive as they spend more time on fewer tasks .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A wartime bunker used by Winston Churchill to watch his troops prepare for the D-Day landings has been listed by English Heritage. The British Prime Minister was joined by Supreme Allied commander Dwight D. Eisenhower and King George VI at the observation point on the eve of the historic invasion of Europe. Fort Henry is today looked after by the National Trust and has been given a Grade Two listing in recognition of its historical significance. Vantage point: The wartime bunker in Dorset, known as Fort Henry, is today looked after by the National Trust . Historical significance: Winston Churchill, King George VI, Eisenhower and Montgomery all watched Operation Smash, a practice D-Day invasion, from the bunker in 1944 . Nearby Second World War beach defences including gun emplacements, pill boxes, and concrete anti-tank 'pimples' have also been listed for protection. It is the first time the fort overlooking Studland Bay, in Dorset, has been listed for its historical importance. English Heritage listed the building because of its historical associations, design and good state of preservation. Six weeks before D-Day in 1944, Studland Bay was the scene of the largest live ammunition practice of the entire war. Thousands of troops took part in Exercise, or Operation, Smash, a full-scale rehearsal for the invasion of occupied Europe. The bay was considered a possible target for a German invasion and was heavily fortified from 1940 onwards. 'We shall fight on the beaches': A Winston Churchill lookalike stands in the bunker at the National Trust's opening of Fort Henry in 2005 . Coastal look-out: The concrete bunker lies on the Dorset coast and offers fine views of the English Channel . How he might have looked: The Churchill lookalike stands in front of the observation point, looking out over Studland Bay . In April 1944 the fort was used by King George VI, Churchill, General Eisenhower along with General Bernard Montgomery and Acting Admiral Louis Mountbatten to watch the exercise. From the bunker, which offers outstanding views over the bay, the VIPs watched a demonstration of carpet bombing followed by an assault landing by troops. The use of live ammunition in a rehearsal run was not regular practice, but military leaders wanted it to be as realistic as possible for the soldiers. Full scale rehearsal: This mural in a nearby hotel shows the scale of Operation Smash, the rehearsal for the D-Day landings held at Studland Bay in 1944 . Built in 1943, Fort Henry was a specially constructed concrete bunker and observation post. It was 90ft long with walls, floor and ceiling all three feet thick, and was considered a safe place for the VIPs to witness the rehearsal of the Normandy landings. These days visitors can go inside the bunker and look through the same observation slit the men used to view the training exercise. V for victory: Sir Winston Churchill is widely regarded as one of the greatest wartime leaders of the 20th century . An English Heritage spokesman said: 'Fort Henry provides an impression of the scale and significance of the preparations for D-Day and is associated with the most prominent figures of the Allied forces. 'Studland Bay is known for its beaches and wildlife but it is great that its role in the Second World War has now been recognised.' Fort Henry was built by Canadian Royal Engineers, who named it after their home base in Ontario. Together with other surviving defences, the bunker forms part of the Studland Beach Second World War walk.","English Heritage bestow Grade II listing on important WWII relic on coast .

"By . Louise Cheer . The vandalism of a Ukrainian church in Sydney's west with swastikas and racial slurs has been labelled 'heinous' and 'disgusting'. Members of the Ukrainian community - including children attending Saturday morning school - found Lidcombe's St Andrew's Ukrainian Catholic Church and cars in its parking lot covered in blue and yellow spray paint. Swastika symbols and slogans reading 'traitors and facists', 'Burn in hell for Bandera' and 'Burn in hell for the Sins of Poroshenko' were sprayed on the building. Stepan Bandera was a former leader of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists, which fought both Nazi Germany and Soviet forces during World War II, and Petro Poroshenko is the democratically elected President of Ukraine. Scroll down for video . The Ukraininan community is in uproar after a catholic church in Sydney's west was vandalised . On Saturday, the Ukrainian community found their church in Lidcombe vandalised with swastikas and racial slurs . Father Simon Ckuj told Channel Nine News the act had left him 'sick in the gut'. 'The church is a sacred place - a place of peace and of love,' he said. 'Also to the elderly community who survived the Second World War, to see swastikas painted on the church, will be a most devastating thing.' St Andrew's Ukrainian Catholic Church was built 50 years ago by the Ukrainian community after they emigrated over to Australia after World War II. It was dedicated to those who were died during the war, . 'Our church is actually a memorial church and in part commemorates Ukrainians who fought against Nazism in World War II,' Father Ckuj said. 'This act completely defiles the memory of those who died fighting fascism.' It is thought the graffiti was done between midnight and 7am on Saturday . Ukrainian leaders - Father Simon Ckuj (left) and Peter Schmigel (right) of the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations - have condemned the act . Despite the terrible act, Father Skuj said the church would pray for the offenders on Sunday morning during liturgy and ask God to forgive them. Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations' Peter Shmigel has called on officials to condemn the actions of perpetrators. 'The Ukrainian Australian community has alerted the NSW Police, the Commonwealth Government and the NSW Government about this disgusting and worrisome incident, and we ask them to act decisively in the interest of public safety and community harmony,' he said. Not even cars at St Andrew's Ukrainian Catholic Church were exempt from being emblazoned with swastikas . Some of the slogans read 'traitors and facists', 'Burn in hell for Bandera' and 'Burn in hell for the Sins of Poroshenko' 'This act completely trashes the principles of multicultural and democratic Australia, where we should always seek to live in a harmonious manner that respects all cultures and religions. 'There is no room for people – like those who attacked our church – to import their foreign conflicts to Australia and Sydney, where our community has made a positive contribution for 65 years.' Communities and Citizenship Minister Victor Dominello said the act was completely unacceptable. 'To use an international racial dispute to vilify a community in Sydney is abhorrent,' he told AAP. 'The use of swastikas as a means of denigrating and attacking any community in NSW is utterly offensive.'","The graffiti was discovered on Saturday morning in Lidcombe .

"By . Mary Greene . What am I bid for this bed? Rococo, ornate, property of a shipping tycoon whose wife has admitted, after 30 years of marriage, that she's always hated it. Bidding starts at £400... it's sold for £2,200 to the man decorating apartments for wealthy Chinese clients. When the well-heeled residents of Chelsea feel the urge to declutter last season's conspicuous consumption, Lots Road Auctions is where they sell off their old stuff. Customer Lili Tarkow-Reinisch, with one of the lots from Chelsea's infamous auction house . Every Sunday afternoon there are bargains galore, whether you fall for the fibre-optic polar bear or a bookcase with zebra-skin lining. Now a new Channel 4 series takes viewers behind the scenes, meeting the auctioneers who would sell their own grandmother - and the customers so desperate for a bargain they'd probably buy her. Every week, valuer Andrew Mackay gets on his push-bike to visit some of west London's wealthiest homes. One lady had paid £30,000 for two corner sofas, he recalls. Andrew Mackay heading off to do a valuation . She got bored with them after six months, put them into storage costing £1,000 a month for three years - by which time they'd cost her £66,000 - and was delighted when they fetched £1,500 each at auction. 'We're lucky here because the vendors aren't selling because they're skint. We get lots of celebrities... They don't want to sell on eBay or have strangers coming to their house - this is a lot more anonymous.' Andrew points to a nondescript leather armchair and footstool. It turns out it's Ralph Lauren, cost £6,000 on Bond Street and now has an estimate of £800-£1,200. You wouldn't look at it twice. 'When there's no chiselled sales assistant, it loses its glitter,' he laughs. It finally goes for £2,000. But not every thing sells. A set of bar stools upholstered in whale skin, originally from Aristotle Onassis's yacht Christina, had to be withdrawn from sale for legal reasons. 'The owner didn't want them back, so we just got rid of them.' Some people are addicted to auctions, such as friends Lili Tarkow-Reinisch and Sam Edge, who are trying to furnish Lili's new seven-bedroom Georgian mansion. 'I've bought eclectic things like an old roulette wheel that was valued at £3,500 but I got for £600, and my kids love it,' says Sam. 'It's no good looking for anything specific; something has to catch your eye.' Sam's tip is to turn up on Monday after the auction, when you can sometimes make a 'cheeky offer' for lots that haven't sold. 'I got a pair of fantastic chandeliers. They were estimated at £2,000-£3,000; I got them for £750.' Most unsold lots - if they're unclaimed - go to a charity furniture shop in Watford. 'They do very well out of us,' says Andrew.

"By . Tom Latchem . He's spent his career playing despicable characters - a rapist in Doctors, a homophobe in Hollyoaks, an abusive boyfriend in Casualty, and now Ross Barton, Emmerdale's womanising crook. But Michael Parr couldn't be happier. 'I think it's better to play baddies,' says the 27-year-old St Helens-born actor. 'They're always in the thick of the action and you get all these wicked things to say and do.' As Emmerdale's resident bad boy Ross, he's had his fair share. Ross arrived in the village a year ago, attacking Laurel Thomas and stealing her car. Since then he's been shot in a drug-gang dispute, bungled a robbery with corrupt cop Donna Windsor, and is now falling for her. Michael Parr insists that, in real life, he doesn't live up to his bad boy character . 'Ross is great to play – he's someone you love to hate,' says Michael. 'And even though he does horrible things, now and then he has a lighter side. 'The lines they give me are absolute gold dust. I don't know what it is about me that gets me chosen for these roles. I think I have a menacing stare that puts the wind up people – that's all I can put it down to.' New York or Dubai? I go to New York all the time because my mum's family come from there.Curry or pizza? Pizza. I had one last night, and the night before, and the night before that - seriously! Beer or spirits? G&T in the summer, but lager the rest of the time. Pub or club? At 27 I already feel I'm older than everyone else in clubs, so I'm becoming a pub person.Oasis or Nirvana? My first album was Nevermind by Nirvana. I like walking with aggressive music, like rock and hip-hop, in my headphones.Designer clothes or high street? I prefer plain clothes to labels.Football or boxing? I did Thai boxing for years and love watching pretty much any kind of martial art. In real life, Michael couldn't be more different from his on-screen character. After graduating from drama school aged 21 and while auditioning for acting roles, he worked as a teaching assistant in special needs schools in London. 'Some days it could be the hardest job I've ever done, but it was also incredibly rewarding,' he recalls. 'When you see the children are learning, and you're growing very fond of them, no other job can compare. I think I was a positive role model,' Michael says proudly. 'I'm still in contact with some of them and write job references for them. 'But they made more of an impression on me! The main thing I took from it is to never feel sorry for myself again. Lots of them had problems at home, so coming to school was a major issue, but they were still excited to be there. It gave me another outlook on life.' But Michael's main goal was always acting and after landing minor roles in other TV soaps and dramas he beat off dozens of rivals for the part of Ross. It came just in time for his biggest fan to see him perform in a major soap. 'My grandma sadly passed away at Christmas, but it meant she got to see me on screen and she had the ultimate bragging rights at church,' he smiles. Michael's acting success is even more remarkable given that he's dyslexic. 'I've always got by,' he says. 'Reading scripts is fine. But if you asked me to do a presenting job, reading an autocue, I just wouldn't have a hope.' He says his hectic schedule leaves little time for romance. 'I've had girlfriends, but nothing too serious as at the moment I'm so busy at work! But never say never...'","Michael Parr always plays the bad guy - from a rapist to a homophobe .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . You may have varying tastes when it comes to actors and singers you find attractive, but when it comes to real relationships, most people have a ‘type’. Dating site Match.com is now offering a high-end service that uses image recognition software to specifically find new dates who fit this type, based on pictures of old flames. Users are asked to send a photo of their ex so it can then be used to find matches with similar characteristics, such as face shape and characteristics. Making use of old memories: Users of Match.com and Three Day Rule's service will be asked to send a photo of their ex (illustrated) so it can then be analysed by facial recgintion technology to find matches with similar characteristics, such as face shape . The first facial recognition app for Google's Glass wearable computer launched in February - and it claims to be able to spot a perfect date in a crowded room. It can scan the room, trying to match people with pictures takes from social networking and dating site, and the app's makers claim it can even check the sex offenders register before deciding on a match. Called NameTag, it blurs the lines between online and offline dating by allowing smartphone users to simply glance at someone nearby, or take their photo, and instantly see that person's name, occupation and even visit their Facebook profile. But finding a partner using the technology comes at price of $5,000 for a six month membership, On the Media reported. The service is not currently available outside of the U.S, and MailOnline has contacted the company about a potential global rollout. The technology is also not currently available for lesbian, gay and bisexual Match.com users. This price does, however, include a dating coach who will meet up with users to talk about their ideal partner, and give tips on how to not blow the first encounter. The dating site has partnered with a firm called Three Day Rule, to let its members upgrade to the Los Angeles-based company’s service and software. Talia Goldstein, the founder of Three Day Rule, told Mashable: ‘People have a type and it's not necessarily about height or race or hair colour, but a lot of it is about face shape.’ ‘I've noticed over my years in matchmaking that people have types. 'I always ask my clients to send me photos of their exes.' She added that although many people claim to not have a type, ex partners usually have the similar facial structures, even if their skin colour, hair or height is different. The dating app (pictured) partnered with Los Angeles-based Three Day Rule to let its members upgrade to the premium service from their existing accounts. It is not currently available outside of the U.S, and the technology is also not currently available for lesbian, gay and bisexual users . Although there aren't precise details on how Three Day Rule's technology works, facial recognition systems (illustrated) generally compare selected facial features from a photograph with a database. These algorithms typically map the relative size and shapes of features such as the eyes, cheekbones and chin . The company said it uses a hybrid approach to find people partners, combining in-depth personality assessments with the facial recognition technology.

"By . John Selby . For Yasmine Smart, granddaughter of circus supremo Billy and niece to Billy Smart Jr, childhood was like growing up in Disneyland. 'I used to think the chimps were my best friends. They'd come to my birthday parties. And I'd play with lions and tigers and polar bears. It's only as an adult that I came to realise just what a great childhood it was.' She's back with Billy Smart's Circus on a tour that will criss-cross the UK for the rest of the year. But any preconceptions of a brash circus veteran, sawdust in her veins, are dispelled in the flesh. Yasmine is now the Ringmaster of her uncles legendary circus . Yasmine, who now takes the role of ringmistress, sounds a bit like Angela Rippon and looks quite a lot like Fiona Bruce's glamorous elder sister. Her family's story is one of fabulous wealth, fierce rivalries and – in Billy Smart Jnr – a playboy dedicated to the pursuit of famous female flesh. Diana Dors, Jayne Mansfield, Shirley Bassey and, yes, even Princess Margaret (or so it was rumoured) all had their names linked to the flamboyant showman in the 50s and 60s. The story begins in the 1930s when Billy Smart Snr, one of 23 children and father to 11, set up a successful travelling fairground. Immediately after the war he added a modest circus which quickly went on to eclipse the funfair. Yasmine recalls her grandfather with affection. Billy Smart was known for hosting some of the world's most glamorous celebrities . 'I was 12 when he died but I remember him well. He was a big personality and a wonderful grandfather although an extremely old-fashioned, autocratic father. He had seven daughters and insisted they were locked up in their caravans by nine o'clock when the funfair was travelling the country.' In 1966, Billy Snr collapsed over a cup of tea in his caravan, felled by a fatal heart attack at 72. There was no shortage of family members only too happy to carry on plying the famous name, and the three surviving brothers – David (Yasmine's father), Ronnie and Billy Jnr – picked up the baton. 'My father was the impresario, Uncle Ronnie was the businessman and Uncle Billy was the larger-than-life figure who appeared in the show.' He was the second Billy Smart Jnr. Tragically, the first died as a lad following an accident in which a vat of scalding water fell on him. 'My grandparents' 11th child was a boy they named Stanley but he hated it and was soon known as Billy, something he changed officially by deed poll when he was older.' The second Billy Smart Jnr quickly became the stuff of legend. Though it was known to few at the time, he was illiterate, unable to read or write until the day he died. He'd ask his wife Hanna or only daughter Baccara to tell him what was on the menu so he could order in a restaurant and then get one or other of them to sign his cheques. But all that happened much later. Billy didn't succumb to marriage until he reached his 40s. First, there was the urgent business of sowing as many wild oats as possible. A child at the time, Yasmine can still remember rumblings of an affair between her uncle and Princess Margaret. 'She came to see one of the shows,' she says, 'and spent lots of time with him in his trailer afterwards.' She can also recall Shirley Bassey being a frequent visitor. 'This was the very end of the 50s and she'd just had her first big hit, Kiss Me, Honey Honey, Kiss Me. I deliberately learnt the words so I could sing them to her. She couldn't have been nicer to me.' Yasmine was her Uncle Billy's favourite niece, she says. 'Every Sunday I'd go and have a cuddle with him. It was entirely innocent, I should add. But I do remember one particular Sunday trotting over and discovering three girls in his trailer: a blonde, a brunette and a redhead.  I was little but I felt very indignant. Clearly he liked having his hands full.' Princess Margaret, Billy Smart and Yasmine when the Princess came to visit the circus . Billy Smart Jnr cut a similar dash in his professional dealings. When the costs of touring became prohibitive at the beginning of the 70s, the big tent was folded for the last time and the three brothers bought Windsor Safari Park as well as a 100-room mansion overlooking it. The Smarts still performed charity shows for the Variety Club and presented TV specials every Easter and Christmas. Yasmine enjoyed a certain notoriety on these TV shows in which she was ringmistress, the first woman to perform such a role and kitted out in fishnet tights, black boots and a red tailcoat. 'I had quite a following. My father used to vet my fan mail in case it contained anything he judged to be unsuitable.' Billy was dazzled by celebrity. Stanley Baker, Michael Caine, Paul Newman – all became friends of the family (Caine later became godfather to Billy's daughter). 'Princess Maragaret came to see one of the shows and spent lots of time with him in his trailer afterwards' Ringo Starr was a regular visitor with the other Beatles dropping round from time to time. After one of Elvis Presley's concerts in America, Billy invited him out for a drink, impressed so legend has it by the King's impeccable manners. And then there were the Royals. Prince Rainier of Monaco loved the circus and would often come to visit. Although the British Royals were fans of Windsor Safari Park – and near neighbours, of course – the relationship suffered a strain after a visit from Prince Charles in the 70s. The Smart brothers had bought a whale, unaware that it was a killer. Charles phoned one day to ask if he could swim with the newcomer. Just as the whale was beginning to eye up the heir to the throne, he was hauled out of the water in the nick of time. 'I don't think his parents were amused,' says Yasmine. 'He nearly became the Prince of Whales.' Yasmine was heartbroken when the circus folded in 1971. 'They told me it would only be for a year and that all efforts in the meantime had to go into the safari park. But everyone got too comfortable living in bricks, as it's known, the park was making lots of money and life was much easier than being on the road.' For the past two decades she's mostly performed in circuses in Europe and America. But when her father, David, died in 2007 of lung cancer, she returned to the UK to be nearer her mother, Olga. Billy had died two years earlier aged 70. Yasmine's cousin Gary revived the circus in 1993 and now, after nearly four decades, she's once again back in scarlet tails and high boots, 'but no fishnets these days,' she says with a smile. 'The moment I stepped into the ring and said: ""Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Billy Smart's Circus,"" it just felt right. It was like coming home.'

"By . Mike Dawes . Amelie Mauresmo has no plans to make major changes to Andy Murray's game, but believes she can help him refine his mental approach as he prepares the defence of his Wimbledon title. Mauresmo, the former women's number one, was named as Murray's coach earlier this month, giving her only a couple of weeks to work with the Scot before his Wimbledon schedule gets under way with a first round clash against David Goffin on Monday. 'His DNA is not going to change dramatically,' Mauresmo said in the Independent on Sunday. 'Maybe I'm trying to add a few little things here and there, but the timing is difficult.' Tweaking: Amelie Mauresmo believes she can help refine Andy Muray's mental approach during Wimbledon . Fighting against time: Mauresmo has only worked with Murray for a few weeks after beoming his coach earlier this month . While the short time available is one factor, the Frenchwoman noted she is not the sort of coach who plans to work on technical details, and will instead take a more philosophical approach. 'Andy knows that,' she added. 'We've talked about this. That's what I did with both Marion (Bartoli) and Vika (Victoria Azarenka), more about the game, how to play, but also how to approach it, approach the moment, approach competitions, and, with Marion last year, (how to) approach the length of the Grand Slam - which Andy knows pretty well already. I'm not going to invent any fancy new drills or anything.' The philosophy Mauresmo espouses could hardly be more different, and more laid back, than Murray's previous coach, the intense Ivan Lendl. 'It's tough to compare Ivan and me,' she said. 'We are so different - in every way. I think our personalities are very different. I don't know Ivan very well. I know him through Andy's eyes. I don't think I will bring him the same as Ivan, which is good, because Ivan brought him a lot and maybe I can bring him different things.' Favourable draw: Murray, pictured during Sunday's practice, will face David Goffin in the first round . Murray's victory at Wimbledon last summer ended a 77-year wait for a British winner of the men's title in SW19. Mauresmo, a former winner herself, has already seen the difference in Murray's approach with the burden lifted. 'It feels great, I think the pressure is less important now that he's won last year,' she said. 'I would say it's pure joy. Of course there is the goal (of winning again) and focusing on the game and what to do on the court, and how to be. But I feel first of all it's joy and being so proud to be there to defend the title.'","Mauresmo has no plans to make major changes to Murray's game .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The brain differences between the young and the old, people with autism, and even female mice have been revealed in a series of beautiful rainbow images. The collection of pictures use a kaleidoscope of colours to highlight neurons, electrical connections between cells, and other brain activity, and will go on show for the first time in St Andrew Square, Edinburgh later this month. The pictures were created using MRI scans, microscopic images and electrical monitoring and are part of an exhibition called The Brain Is Wider Than The Sky. Colourful images show the activity in the human brain in a kaleidoscope of colours and will go on show for the first time in St Andrew Square, Edinburgh. This Wiring The Brain image shows shows detailed maps of brain wiring in a sleeping newborn baby (left) and an adult in their seventies (right) visualised using an MRI scanner . Researchers from the University of Edinburgh created the exhibition to show the beauty they encounter while studying neurological disorders, such as autism. The exhibition also highlights the advanced technologies used by scientists to image the brain and its cells in action. Some of the pictures, including one titled The Female Mosaic, look like impressionist artwork, but instead show neurons in the brain of a female mouse. During the course of their research, the scientists who created the images found that autism and intellectual disability - linked to the X chromosome - are more prevalent in men than women. The pictures are created from MRI scans, microscopic images and electrical monitoring, and are part of an exhibition called The Brain Is Wider Than The Sky. This image, called The Breakdown In Communication, shows differences between a typical brain (left) and autism (right) Researchers from the University of Edinburgh have created the exhibition to show the beauty that they come across while studying neurological disorders such as autism. The Sensory Superhighway is pictured, which shows the complex electrical connections between brain cells . Males have one X and one Y chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes - one inherited from each parent. To compensate for this second X, each cell in a female body randomly ‘turns off’ one X chromosome. The picture shows that neurons in the mouse’s brain have turned off the X chromosome inherited from the mother (in green) and those that have silenced the X inherited from the father (in red). In another picture called Glial Grandeur, the image created looks almost like a picture of deep space taken from the Hubble Telescope. An Electron's View Of The Brain shows that neurons talk to one another across a gap called the synaptic cleft, rather than being directly connected to one another. A trained eye can identify the wires . This image, titled High Fidelity, shows the difference in brain signals from a typical brain (left) and from a brain affected by a condition similar to Fragile X Syndrome, which is the most common inherited form of autism . The brain has two main cell types - neurons and glia. Glia - named from the Greek word for glue - were originally thought of as the support cells for neurons. But it is now known that they are essential for many brain functions. The image in the collection shows two main types of glia from a human brain - astrocytes (in green) and a white oligodendrocyte. Researchers from the university’s Patrick Wild Centre collaborated with the Scottish charity Mindroom, to create the exhibition. ‘The human brain has more cells than there are stars in the Milky Way and these cells communicate through a thousand times as many connections,’ said Sally Till, a fellow at the centre. This image, titled The Female Mosaic, shows neurons in the brain of a female mouse. It reveals the neurons that have switched off the X chromosome inherited from the mother (in green), and those that have silenced the X chromosome inherited from the father (in red) ‘Our goal is to understand how even small changes in these connections can have such detrimental effects on learning and memory.’ Sophie Dow, Founder of Mindroom, added: ‘These images are simply too beautiful to be hidden away in a lab. ‘They were created to further our understanding of the brain but they can also be viewed as stunning examples of abstract art. 'Our hope is that people admiring the pictures on show will also come away with a greater awareness of what it means to be affected by learning difficulties and other brain conditions.’ This image might look like one taken by the Hubble Telescope of deep space, but Glial Grandeur shows the two main types of glia from a human brain - astrocytes (in green) and a white oligodendrocyte. They also look a little bit like a spider's web, only this web measures just 1/20 of a millimetre.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Most of us have sat cowering behind a cushion, or deep in a cinema chair unable to look away from the screen as a character is maimed or killed in a horror film. And while this might seem like strange and morbid behaviour, scientists have discovered what is going on in our bodies to drive this reaction. They found people exposed to blood and guts showed higher levels of attention the more extreme the content became - even though the people watching admitted to being disgusted. Scientists claim they have discovered that morbid fascination is a physiological reaction, which explains why people are unable to look away when watching a scary film (illustrated). Tests showed that people exposed to blood and guts had higher levels of attention the more disgusting the content became . Participants in the study watched film clips showing three types of disgust: socio-moral, body product and death, and gore. Previous studies claim socio-moral disgust includes unacceptable human transgressions, such as lying and betrayal. People reacted relatively slowly to clips that elicited socio-moral disgust. They were initially attentive before feeling negative. But participants reacted to core disgusts – triggered by the showing of bodily fluids, gore and death – immediately and were at once negative and defensive. Body product disgusts in particular showed an initially defensive response. Instead of becoming attentive straight away, viewers became immediately negative, while the heart rate accelerated, indicating the content was, at first, too disgusting to watch. People typically forgot that they had seen before watching a gory film clip. However, their memory improved after watching all three types of clips and their heart rate slowed, suggesting they became more attentive over time. A total of 120 people watched film clips showing three types of disgust, described as socio-moral, body product and death, and gore. The experiment was devised by Bridget Rubenking of University of Central Florida, and Annie Lang of Indiana University. Previous studies have given examples of socio-moral disgust as unacceptable human transgressions, such as lying and betrayal. During the viewings, scientists measured the participants’ heart rate, facial expressions and skin moisture while they watched the footage. They then tested the viewers’ memories after watching the clips to examine the differences between the recollections, and the physiological levels of activity. Measurements were taken from before the onset of disgust in each clip to time points immediately afterwards. They then compared the data across the different types of clips. Clips that triggered socio-moral disgust elicited a slower response of disgust from the participants who were initially attentive and then increasingly negative, according to the study, published in the Journal of Communication. But . participants reacted to core disgusts – triggered by the showing of . bodily fluids, gore and death – immediately and were at once negative . and defensive. 'Body . product disgusts' in particular showed an initially defensive response. Instead of becoming attentive straight away, viewers became immediately . negative and aroused, while the heart rate accelerated, indicating that . the content was at first too disgusting to pay attention to. Memory improved during and after watching revolting clips, across all disgust types, and participants' heart rates showed a deeper deceleration over time. This means people became more attentive and couldn't look away. A still of Marion Crane, played by Janet Leigh, in Psycho is pictured . Memory of content that appeared before the gory scenes was at 'near-chance levels' - this means it disrupted peoples’ thought processes and made them forget what they had seen before watching the disgusting clip. Memory improved during and after watching revolting clips, across all disgust types, and participants' heart rates showed a deeper deceleration over time, which suggested to the scientists that people became more attentive to the content as it went on. Together, this data suggests that despite being fully aware of how disgusted they were, participants could not turn away from any of the disgusting content and actually paid more attention the more revolting the clips content got. This pattern was especially pronounced in response to the gory videos. ‘We often choose to view entertainment media to simply make ourselves feel good and we also likely often choose entertainment media that will provide meaning, fulfilment and spark introspection,’ Dr Rubenking said. ‘Despite whatever motives encouraged the decision to watch or not watch, this study demonstrates that when we're watching entertainment content that introduces specific types of disgust, our bodies react as being disgusted, and we can articulate that we are disgusted by the content.’ ‘However, we pay more attention once disgust is introduced and we remember the content with disgust better, making it a smart device for content creators to use, in moderation.’","Scientists from the University of Central Florida Indiana University made 120 people watch three types of disgusting video clips .

"By . Associated Press . Ralph Lauren's love for the American flag and American style earned him high honors Tuesday from the Smithsonian Institution, celebrating his five decades in fashion. Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton helped present the James Smithson Bicentennial Medal to the 74-year-old designer at the National Museum of American History following a naturalization ceremony for 15 new U.S. citizens. The award also marks the 200th anniversary of the actual flag that inspired the national anthem. Lauren helped fund a major effort to preserve that flag. Scroll down for video . Taking an award: Designer Ralph Lauren (right), stands with Smithsonian Secretary G. Wayne Clough (left), and Hillary Clinton (center) has received the James Smithson Bicentennial Medal 'for his embodiment of the American experience through the medium of fashion, design and philanthropy' Applause: Mrs Clinton presented the legendary American designer with his award, wearing her first custom Ralph Lauren creation out of symbolism - a cobalt blue pantsuit . Mrs Clinton noted that Mr Lauren is the son of immigrants from Belarus who grew up in the Bronx, New York. 'Now surely Ralph and his family ... could not have imagined, or maybe they could have when they landed in the Bronx, that their lives would be the embodiment of the American dream,' Mrs Clinton said. 'In particular, Ralph, the youngest, would become synonymous with American aspiration and style.' Mr Lauren told the Associated Press that he cultivated this style as a young child, not out of an interest in fashion, but out of a yearning to fit in at school. Because he was the youngest of four children, all of his clothes were hand-me-downs - many of which were old-fashioned or not his taste. This inspired Mr Lauren to design and create his own clothes. He explained: 'When your parents are not able to afford the kind of clothes as a kid growing up, I had to work myself and earn my way and buy my own things. I just wanted to look like one of the guys and have the girls look at me.' Mrs Clinton wore a pantsuit to Tuesday's event that was Mr Lauren's first-ever custom-designed outfit for her, which included a cobalt-blue structured silk jacket. She toted a white Ralph Lauren Collection Soft Ricky Bag, which retails for $2,500. 'I think she looked fabulous,' Mr Lauren told U.S. News, adding: 'The color was spectacular, she loves color.' Earnest beginnings: While Mr Lauren is at the helm of a massive fashion brand today, he started his career by selling ties out of a drawer in the Empire State Building . Mr Lauren also wore an old suit - a pintstripe style that he continuously comes back to because he finds it comfortable and stylish. He explained: 'I can say that I'm about style, not fashion. I'm about timeless style, about quality, and that doesn't mean it has to be boring. That means it's something that continues on because I don't throw out my clothes. 'The suit that I'm wearing is an old suit. I didn't just make this suit. I like the familiarity in a way because it's mine.' Mrs Clinton and Mr Lauren first joined forces in 1998, when she was First Lady, to raise money for the Smithsonian to preserve the original 'Star-Spangled Banner' flag that inspired the national anthem, along with other historic artifacts, through her Save America's Treasures program. Mr Lauren donated $10 million to help restore the flag and another $3 million to support the historic preservation program. 'Ralph responded to the call. He didn't have to,' Mrs Clinton said. 'But he understood because it was deep within him that part of being an American is giving back.' The admiration is mutual. When asked by U.S. News if he would support a Clinton presidential bid, Mr Lauren said 'when she says yes, we’ll talk about it. I am a fan of Hillary’s.' Mr Lauren is known for designs that have defined American fashion and for his patriotic uniforms for U.S. Olympic athletes. Just like them: Mr Lauren, the child of Jewish immigrants, took his award immediately following a naturalization ceremony for 15 new U.S. citizens . Kind words: In her speech for Mr Lauren, Mrs Clinton said that the designer, 74, is 'synonymous with American aspiration and style' He got his start selling ties from a drawer at the Empire State Building. Now Ralph Lauren Corp. has 25,000 employees worldwide. But as Mr Lauren explained, his meager beginnings are the moments he is most proud of in his career. 'I started with neckties, which are a very small thing and people aren't even wearing them today. Neckties helped start my career. When a man wore a tie, it had to make a statement,' Mr Lauren said of his first entrepreneurial push, which is one of his favorite career moments. The Smithsonian award citation honored Mr Lauren 'for his embodiment of the American experience through fashion, design and philanthropy.'","On Tuesday Mr Lauren was awarded with the James Smithson Bicentennial Medal .

"By . Associated Press . The Ebola outbreak ravaging West Africa is 'totally out of control' and doctors are stretched to the limit in their attempts to respond to the disease, a senior medic said today. The current outbreak has caused more deaths than any other on record, said an official from the Doctors without Boarders charity. Ebola has been linked to more than 330 deaths in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, according to the latest numbers from the World Health Organization. International organizations and the governments involved need to send in more health experts and increase public education messages about how to stop the spread of the disease, Bart Janssens, the director of operations for the group in Brussels, said on Friday. Scroll down for video . People protest outside a hospital as Liberia President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf  visits the area as reports suggest hundreds have died from Ebola in Monrovia, Liberia. Senior medics have called for more health experts to be flown in and for public safety messages to be increased . 'The reality is clear that the epidemic is now in a second wave,' Janssens said. 'And, for me, it is totally out of control.' The outbreak, which began in Guinea either late last year or early this year, had appeared to slow before picking up pace again in recent weeks, including spreading to the Liberian capital for the first time. 'This is the highest outbreak on record and has the highest number of deaths, so this is unprecedented so far,' said Armand Sprecher, a public health specialist with Doctors Without Borders. According to a World Health Organization list, the highest previous death toll was in the first recorded Ebola outbreak in Congo in 1976, when 280 deaths were reported. Because Ebola often touches remote areas and the first cases sometimes go unrecognized, it is likely that there are deaths that go uncounted, both in this outbreak and previous ones. The multiple locations of the current outbreak and its movement across borders make it one of the 'most challenging Ebola outbreaks ever,' Fadela Chaib, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organization, said earlier in the week. The outbreak shows no sign of abating and that governments and international organizations were 'far from winning this battle,' Unni Krishnan, head of disaster preparedness and response for Plan International, said Friday. A Liberian nurse at the Redemption Hospital in Monrovia, Liberia where a nurse reportedly died of Ebola virus . But Janssens' description of the Ebola outbreak was even more alarming, and he warned that the governments affected had not recognized the gravity of the situation. He criticized the World Health Organization for not doing enough to prod leaders and said that it needs to bring in more experts to do the vital work of tracing all of the people who have been in contact with the sick. 'There needs to be a real political commitment that this is a very big emergency,' he said. 'Otherwise, it will continue to spread, and for sure it will spread to more countries.' The World Health Organization did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But Tolbert Nyenswah, Liberia's deputy minister of health, said that people in the highest levels of government are working to contain the outbreak as proved by the fact that that Liberia had a long period with no new cases before this second wave. The governments involved and international agencies are definitely struggling to keep up with the severity of the outbreak, said Krishnan of Plan, which is providing equipment to the three affected countries and spreading information about how people can protect themselves against the disease. But he noted that the disease is striking in one of the world's poorest regions, where public health systems are already fragile. 'The affected countries are at the bottom of the human development index,' he said in an emailed statement. 'Ebola is seriously crippling their capacities to respond effectively in containing the spread.' The situation requires a more effective response, said Janssens of Doctors Without Borders. With more than 40 international staff currently on the ground and four treatment centers, Doctors Without Borders has reached its limit to respond, he said. Empty hospital beds at the hospital after nurses and patients fled the hospital due to a number of deaths. 330 lives have been claimed following the outbreak . 'It's the first time in an Ebola epidemic where (Doctors Without Borders) teams cannot cover all the needs, at least for treatment centers,' he said. It is unclear, for instance, if the group will be able to set up a treatment center in Liberia, like the ones it is running in in Guinea and Sierra Leone, he said. For one thing, Janssens said, the group doesn't have any more experienced people in its network to call on. As it is, some of its people have already done three tours on the ground. Janssens said this outbreak is particularly challenging because it began in an area where people are very mobile and has spread to even more densely populated areas, like the capitals of Guinea and Liberia. The disease typically strikes sparsely populated areas in central or eastern Africa, where it spreads less easily, he said. By contrast, the epicenter of this outbreak is near a major regional transport hub, the Guinean city of Gueckedou. He said the only way to stop the disease's spread is to persuade people to come forward when symptoms occur and to avoid touching the sick and dead. 'There is still not a real change of behavior of the people,' he said. 'So a lot of sick people still remain in hiding or continue to travel. And there is still news that burial practices are remaining dangerous.'

"By . Emma Glanfield . Josh Grant, 26, pictured, was shocked when Apple asked for written consent from his mother, who passed away from breast cancer earlier this year, to unlock her iPad . A grieving son has accused Apple of having an 'utter lack of understanding and discretion' after the company refused to unlock his dead mother’s iPad - and asked for written permission from her. Josh Grant, 26, from London, became the co-executor of his mother Anthea Grant’s will and estate with his brother Patrick when she passed away from breast cancer, aged 59, earlier this year. He said his mother enjoyed playing games on the iPad after her husband died in 2010 and said she liked its raft of new security measures since updating to iOS7. However, when the brothers contacted Apple following their mother’s death on January 19, they were told they would need 'written permission' from their mother to access the account. On his blog, named Mustn’t Grumble, Josh wrote: ‘Unfortunately in her dying days she didn’t think to tell us her Apple ID password. Funnily enough, I think she had bigger things to worry about. ‘Patrick and I were named co-executors of the will and found ourselves responsible for mum’s estate. 'A tiny piece of that estate is her iPad, which my brothers and I agreed could go to Patrick. ‘In order to clear mum’s account from the iPad and set Patrick’s up they have asked for written permission from mum.’ After reiterating to Apple that their mother had passed away, Josh said the tech giant asked to see copies of her death certificate, will and a letter from the family’s solicitor. However, this was still not enough and the brothers were then told by the US firm to provide a court order to unlock the device, invoking the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. Josh, who said the court order could cost hundreds of pounds, was left disappointed with the way Apple handled the sensitive issue. He blogged: ‘I have always been a fan of Apple but this incident has changed my opinion of them completely. ‘Their utter lack of understanding and discretion in a time of great personal sadness has been astonishing. For a company that sells itself on the idea we are all part of one big Apple family, they have been very cold. 'For a company that sells itself on the idea we are all part of one big Apple family, they have been very cold.' Josh Grant . ‘Understandably, my brother has given up and we now have a redundant iPad. If anyone has any suggestions for an unusable iPad please do send them in. I’ve suggested illuminated placemat and shiny paperweight.’ Apple said confusion surrounded the iPad because Patrick asked the firm to provide his mother's Apple ID password which can’t be released without a court order. However, the company said the matter had since been resolved after it was confirmed he actually wanted to use the iPad for himself rather than access Apple ID protected files. The tech giant said it was then able to turn off the Activation Lock security feature which only requires a copy of the death certificate and a legal document confirming the right to transfer the deceased's property. The new iOS7 security measures are designed to protect users' online iCloud accounts which can be used to store personal information, documents and photographs. In iCloud's terms and conditions, Apple warns: ‘You agree that your Account is non-transferable and that any rights to your Apple ID or Content within your Account terminate upon your death. ‘Upon receipt of a copy of a death certificate your Account may be terminated and all Content within your Account deleted.'","Anthea Grant passed away from breast cancer, aged 59, earlier this year .

The Bru, also known as Reang, fled Mizoram in 1997 following ethnic conflicts with the Mizos and have been in refugee camps since. The repatriation process was due to be carried out today but the Bru have refused to return to the neighbouring state without cash worth about £1,400 per family, increased food rations and a written agreement from the Mizoram government ensuring their safety. The tribes women stood together with placards saying 'We demand land allotment' and 'We want a written agreement' among their demands before they go back to Mizoram. Others staged a sit-in.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Brits are being ripped off by resort shops while on holiday – with prices up to 53 per cent more expensive than out-of-town supermarkets. New figures show travellers on self-catering trips abroad should head outside their resorts to get the lowest prices, according to Post Office Travel Money and holiday company Cosmos. The biggest disparity was in Majorca, where basic provisions for a one-week family holiday cost £86 in supermarkets but were as much as £133 - or 53 per cent more - in resort shops. Price difference: Tourists are being advised to buy basic produce out of town rather than resort shops . While in the Portuguese Algarve, products were found to be 48 per cent more expensive at a resort mini-market than at a supermarket. Including items such as bread, milk and breakfast cereals, supermarket costs in the Algarve were just £56 for one week, but as much as £83 at an in-resort mini-market. Those able to get to supermarkets would also get better value in Lanzarote, Crete, Minorca, Majorca and Limassol in Cyprus. Rip off: Local shops in destinations such as Mallorca are more expensive, according to the survey . The next best-value supermarket prices (£59) were to be found on Spain's Costa Blanca, which was one of the few destinations surveyed where resort prices were better value than supermarket ones. Of the destinations in the survey, Limassol had the highest supermarket prices, with the provisions costing £94. Andrew Brown, of Post Office Travel Money, said: ‘Self-catering can be a great way to save money on holiday but the wide price variations between resorts makes it important to do some homework before booking. ‘Our research shows that well over half of families bust their holiday budget by hundreds of pounds and food shopping is one of the main reasons why.’","Prices compared for basic provisions for a one-week family holiday .

Robin Lewis, co-author of The New Rules of Retail, told Business Insider the retailer's CEO, Mike Jeffries, 'doesn't want larger people shopping in his store, he wants thin and beautiful people. 'He doesn't want his core customers to see people who aren't as hot as them wearing his clothing,' Mr Lewis added. 'People who wear his clothing should feel like they're one of the ""cool kids.""' Calling all thin people: Abercrombie & Fitch, which only employs 'good looking people' and doesn't make women's sizes above large, was accused of purposefully excluding plus-sized customers . While Abercrombie & Fitch offers men's sizes in XXL, Mr Lewis believes this is to appeal to muscular football players and wrestlers. Mr Jeffries told Salon in a 2006 interview: 'That’s why we hire good-looking people in our stores. Because good-looking people attract other good-looking people, and we want to market to cool, good-looking people. We don’t market to anyone other than that.' In 2004, the company was sued for giving positions to white applicants, to the exclusion of minorities; and in June 2009, British student Riam Dean, who was born without a left forearm, won approximately $12,000 in an employment tribunal.

Managers at Abercrombie & Fitch's London store had forced her to work in the stock room, out of sight of customers. And last year, it emerged staff were . forced to carry out military-style exercises while at work, in order to . maintain the 'thin and beautiful' aesthetic they had been hired for. Company policy: CEO, Mike Jeffries, 'doesn't want larger people shopping in his store, he wants thin and beautiful people' According to a company email, male employees at the retailer's Milan flagship had to carry out ten push-ups, while women who failed to measure up were given ten squats. Despite the risk of alienating . potential customers (both H&M and American Eagle offer XXL sizes for . men and women, and use models larger than size 12 in advertising . campaigns), Mr Jeffries sees it as good branding to exclude particular . shoppers. 'In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids,' he explained candidly. 'We . go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid . with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don’t belong . [in our clothes], and they can’t belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.' He argues that ostracizing some customers, by using sex and six-packs to sell clothes, leaves his loyal customers wanting more. 'Those . companies that are in trouble are trying to target everybody: young, . old, fat, skinny. But then you become totally vanilla.

"By . Tim Shipman, Deputy Political Editor . A group of 37 MPs have put their names to a report which says packaging should remain on cigarettes to help struggling small businesses . Plans to sell cigarettes in plain packaging should be dropped, a group of influential Tory MPs demand today. The Free Enterprise group of backbenchers, which includes many rising stars from the new intake, today calls for the plans to be abandoned in order to prevent small shops being hit by a fall in tobacco sales or a rise in tobacco smuggling. Some 37 MPs have put their names to a report published today on ways to promote ‘the growth of Britain’s small businesses’ which demands a cull of damaging regulations. The report calls on ministers to ‘drop proposals for plan packaging tobacco products’. The Prime Minister appeared to kill off plans to impose plain packaging in July, saying further evidence was needed to show whether it would be effective. But in a surprise move, public health minister Jane Ellison announced last week that paediatrician Sir Cyril Chantler will carry out a rapid review of the evidence by March - meaning plain packs could be brought in by the time of the 2015 election. The review was ordered in response to evidence emerging from Australia, which last year became the first country to introduce plain packaging. The change of heart was welcomed by health campaigners, but tobacco companies said a ban lead to an increase in smuggling and counterfeit products. The Free Enterprise Group of MPs warned that introducing plain packs is unnecessary regulation that will hurt small businesses. Those who have signed the paper include the chairman of the Treasury select committee Andrew Tyrie, David Cameron’s envoy to the Indian community Prit Patel and leading backbenchers like Jesse Norman, Nadhim Zahawi, Andrea Leadsom and Margot James. David Cameron appeared to rule out the possibility of plain packets last July but a recent U-turn means they could be on shelves by the next election in 2015 . One of the MPs involved told the Mail: ‘This is a an unnecessary burden for business. Lots of businesses sell tobacco. It could be a problem for small businesses.’ Their report was written before the government u-turn but Kwasi Kwarteng, who coordinates the activities of the group, said it would be published unchanged today. He called on the Chantler review to consider the risks to business, as well as those of public health. Kwasi Kwarteng MP, said: ‘I look forward to seeing Sir Cyril Chantler’s conclusions and would also hope that the potential consequences for businesses feature in the government’s decision making. ‘This is a complex and technical area of policy and the government is absolutely right to take the time to consider all the available evidence rather than to rush towards legislating as the Labour opposition is demanding.’","Group of MPs have backed report calling for regulation to be dropped .

"By . Bianca London . Kiev has been turned upside down by the bloodiest protests of recent European history and the stand-off between Russia and the West has left the Ukrainian capital in the biggest state of chaos since the Cold War. As Ukraine's government grappled with Russia taking control of Crimea and armed pro-Russian separatists seizing government buildings, designers were quietly preparing for fashion week against all the odds. In response to the unrest, the designers last week put on a series of eerie silent shows with pervasive political themes dedicated to those killed. Scroll down for video .

Ukraine's fashion scene has grown rapidly in recent years thanks to increasing votes of confidence from the mainstream industry - they now have their own version of Vogue - and the designers are regularly featured in British Vogue and the Financial Times. However, the future of fashion is currently looking uncertain as designers struggle to maintain business in a country wrecked by violence.

"By . Stephanie Linning . Reform: Sir Roderick Floud, former president of University UK, said that the current higher education system is 'messy and muddled' and that many existing institutions should be closed or merged . Half of British universities should be closed and others merged in sweeping reforms to the 'messy, muddled' higher education system, a leading academic has said. Sir Roderick Floud, former president of Universities UK - which represents 121 of the nation's universities - said that there were too many universities and that they were not focusing enough on research and education. He said that this created a 'messy, muddled non-system' that was ineffective and in need of significant change. The former vice-chancellor of London Metropolitan University, which was formed by the merger of two of the capital's institutions, said that major cities like London, Leeds and Oxford did not need to have more than one university and said they should either close or merge. Writing in the Times Higher Education magazine he said: 'In London, the situation is even more bizarre, with some 40 universities within the M25 and more arriving by the day.' He said that in the current system universities in the same city were left 'glowering at each other and competing to attract the attentions of businesses and local authorities.' There was also a suggestion that universities such as Oxford and Cambridge should stop recruiting undergraduate students and focus instead on postgraduate study and research. This plan would affect more than 6,000 undergraduate students a year who are enrolled at the elite institutions. Sir Roderick also suggested that universities should be allowed to increase the current £9,000 cap on tuition fees for undergraduate students. He said that without an increase institutions that are supposed to be independent would remain dependent on public money and fees from international students - who pay more than those based in Britain. The argument to raise fees has also been put forward by current Universities UK president and Surrey University vice-chancellor Sir Christopher Snowden who said that they should be raised in line with inflation. In an interview he said that fees 'can't remain frozen forever' and that in real terms, by 2016, oncurrent inflation rates the maximum fee will be worth about £8,250. Lack of focus: Pembroke College at Oxford University. Sir Roderick said that universities such as Oxford and Cambridge should stop recruiting undergraduates and focus instead on postgraduate study and research . Sir Roderick's comments come just before he delivered a lecture at Gresham College, London, where he has been provost for the past six years. They are at odds with the view of universities minister David Willets, who has indicated that he intends to expand on the number of higher education institutes - there are currently more than 150 - by building campuses in areas where there are none. In addition to teaching and research, many of universities host conferences, organise catering services, offer career advice - they even invest in the stock market.","Sir Roderick Floud said the higher education system is 'ineffective'

"By ANTHONY BOND . Updated: . 11:07 EST, 8 October 2011 . Heathrow and Gatwick airports could be linked by a high speed rail network to create the world's first 'virtual hub' airport under proposals being considered by ministers. Dubbed 'Heathwick', the scheme would see a £5 billion high-speed rail service linking the west London site to west Sussex in 15 minutes. Travelling at speeds of 180mph, trains would leave every five minutes and would follow the route of the M25. Ambitious: An image showing the route of the high-speed trains which would travel between Heathrow and Gatwick airports . Heathwick would need to transfer passengers and their baggage from one airport to the other within 75 minutes in order to be considered a hub. It is hoped the scheme would ease the congestion of flights over the capital. The plans have been welcomed by Gatwick airport and business groups. However BAA - the operator of Heathrow - and the budget airlines of Ryanair and EasyJet are firmly against the idea. Speaking to The Times, BAA said: 'A virtual hub between Heathrow and Gatwick faces insurmountable technical, operational, political and financial challenges, and would take many years to deliver. 'It provides no extra runway capacity in the South East, which is the key problem identified by the Department for Transport's own passenger forecast'. Change: The plans for 'Heathwick' would see Heathrow airport, pictured, linked with Gatwick . Business leaders, however, are piling pressure on the government to develop air links following concerns that Britain risks losing trade deals with emerging markets such as China and Brazil. Supporters argue that Heathwick would provide a quicker and cheaper answer to capacity problems at Britain's airports rather than building a new airport in the Thames Estuary. They say Heathwick would allow London's airports to better compete with Charles de Gaulle, Frankfurt and Schiphol by encouraging more transfers. Britain currently loses £1.2 billion a year to the Netherlands, Germany and France. Big plans: Passengers from Gatwick airport, pictured, could be transferred along with their baggage to Heathrow in just 75 minutes under proposals being considered by ministers . Victoria Borwick, a member of the transport committee on the Greater London Assembly, is keen for the scheme to go ahead. Speaking to The Times, she said: 'There are all sorts of ideas about but most of them are long-term. None of them addresses the issue of capacity that faces us now. 'If we can link Heathrow and Gatwick in 15 minutes, that would be phenomenal.' The proposals to create the world's first 'virtual hub' airport between Heathrow and Gatwick have not gone down well with budget airlines. The 'Heathwick' scheme would see Gatwick focusing on short and medium-haul flights to and from Europe while Heathrow would focus on long-haul destinations. Low cost carriers such as EasyJet and Ryanair would be encouraged to leave Gatwick for Stansted and Luton airports to create extra capacity for flights from the west Sussex site. However, Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary is firmly against the proposals. Speaking to the Financial Times, he said there was 'no way of moving the budget airlines out of Gatwick'. He added: 'There won't be a high speed rail link between Heathrow and Gatwick in my lifetime. The cost of it would be prohibitive'. EasyJet was also dismissive about the scheme, saying: 'EasyJet will fight any attempt to force us out of Gatwick all the way'. Professor David Begg, chairman of the British Chambers of Commerce infrastructure Commission, said trade with markets to which Britain is connected with direct flights is 20 times greater than with those it does not. Speaking to The Times, he said: 'Hub airports need a large percentage of transfer passengers to make their wide and far-reaching network of routes economic. It is this connectivity which is crucial to our economy.' The Government is currently reviewing aviation policy and examining how to expand air capacity around London without jeopardising green targets. It follows the coalition overturning plans for a third runway at Heathrow. Two of the potential problems with the scheme are that both airports have different owners and in the current economic uncertainty funding could also be an issue. Taxpayers are already forking out £2 billion a year for the Crossrail project, which will not be finished before 2018. Bosses at Gatwick airport are positive about Heathwick, saying: 'We would be very pleased to discuss the idea further with ministers'.","180mph trains would link both sites in just 15 minutes .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A dilapidated school where pupils were forced to have lessons in the corridor because of the decaying classrooms is still in a state of disrepair one year on. Teachers at Richard Lee Primary School, in Wyken, Coventry, have told how nothing has changed. One one occasion in the last twelve months, a corridor was turned into a river after blocked and cracked storm drains overflowed. Bleak outlook: Pupils Georgia Diston and Harvey Billing have to resort to holding an umbrella at Richard Lee Primary School in Coventry because there are so many leaks in their dilapidated classroom . Disrepair: After class, the two youngsters have to then walk along crumbling corridors, one of which became a river when a cracked storm drain overflowed . And in the last two weeks, six leaks have sprung up in classroom roofs, forcing the children to hold umbrellas during lessons. It all adds to a tale of woe at the 509-pupil school - soon to increase to 700 students in September - that includes crumbling walls, moldy carpets, drafty doors, cracked windows, collapsing roofs and freezing classrooms. When Nick Gibb, minister of state for schools, visited he dubbed the conditions the worst he has ever seen. Mr Gibb added: 'I would be very cross about the standard of the building if I was a parent with children at the school. This is clearly a very poor building that was built in the 1950s and needs work. Patch job: Headteacher Nicola Harwood in one of the out-of-bounds classrooms, which have sprung six leaks in the last two weeks . Expensive: Mrs Harwood looks up at one of the large leaks in the corridor. She believes it will revealed that it would cost upwards of £1million to bring the school up to standard . 'Children failed': Schools Minister Nick Gibb (pictured) said they were the worst conditions he had ever seen when he visited the school this week . The run-down primary school hit the . headlines last year when four and five-year-olds were forced to have . lessons in a corridor after their classroom was flooded by a faulty . boiler. And just five months later part of a roof collapsed - again forcing kids out of their classroom. Pupils, . teachers and parents have since campaigned for a rebuild - even taking . their fight to Downing Street and the Department for Education in July. Their . protests prompted a visit from Mr Gibb yesterday, where the minister . praised staff in keeping teaching standards at the school high, even . when the facilities were not. He . said: 'This is a school focused on making sure that children improve . their reading and arithmetic, despite the problems that they labour . under.' The school is now part of seven in Coventry bidding for funding as part of the Priority Schools Building Programme. But headteacher Nicola Harwood said: 'We will have to wait and see if funding materialises. Hopefully our school will be at the top of the list to receive money or a rebuild. Frustrated: Mrs Harwood, pointing out a crack in the food store cupboard, is desperately hoping for funding to materialise before conditions get any worse . 'Children failed': Schools Minister Nick Gibb (pictured) said they were the worst conditions he had ever seen when he visited the school this week . 'For now we will have to keep patching up the school and continue to make sure Richard Lee is fit for purpose.' Nicola revealed that it would cost . upwards of £1million to bring the school up to standard - including a . £40,000 boiler system and £25,000 to install new doors and windows . throughout. The headteacher added: 'Since last year when we moved classes into a corridor, that has been flooded by broken storm drains overflowing. 'It was like a river running down the corridor. We are running out of rooms which don’t have anything wrong with them to be honest. 'It meant we had to take classes into the main hall, which is not ideal. 'I think there are issues over funding for schools. They need to do surveys to make sure schools don’t get to the stage we are at again. 'The most frustrating thing is that the decision on who will receive money keeps on being put back. 'It could be another year before we see any change but I am very optimistic and the minister had nothing but good things to say about the level of teaching. Coventry MP Bob Ainsworth, who has raised the school's plight in parliament, said: 'We made sure the schools minister was aware of the really shocking state of the building and he said it was the worst he had seen. 'I knew that if he came he would be shocked and all we can hope for is that it puts Richard Lee at the centre of minds when it comes to deciding funding allocations for the Priority Schools Building Programme.'","Crumbling walls, moldy carpets, cracked windows and collapsing roofs...

The firm claims that its design would give fans of brands the chance to stay in a place that is totally of a company’s aesthetic.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An Illinois fourth grader is suing one of his classmates for bullying him over the span of his third grade year. On Tuesday, Matthew and Deveri . Del Core filed suit  on behalf of their son Joaquin, naming a classmate identified as 'C.A.' in court papers as well as that boy's parents, the school district, and the principal of Robert Frost Elementary school, Jeffrey Brusso. Deveri DeL Core claims the district retaliated by firing her from her job in the elementary school's cafeteria just hours after the suit was filed. Illinois fourth grader Joaquin Del Core is suing one of his classmates for bullying him over the span of his third grade year . Matthew and Deveri Del Core filed the suit on behalf of their son, naming the bully along with the school district and school principal . She told NBC Chicago the given reason was that she was being fired 'at the . request of the client' over actions she'd taken that had 'been . detrimental to the physical and mental well-being of students and . staff.' While the school declined comment on the termination, district superintendent Kate Hyland said the school's policies on safety were enforced with the rigorous. 'As a district, and at each of our . schools, we value the safety and security of each and every one of our . students and staff members, and take bullying prevention very . seriously,' he wrote in a statement. 'We work diligently to provide a . healthy, productive environment for all our students to learn and grow.' Joaquin claims to have been attacked almost weekly, being hit, punched, and kicked as well as receiving more violent threats. 'There was everything from him . choking my son and threatening to kill him, said he was going to go home . and get a knife and come back and kill him,' said Deveri Del Core. 'My . son would wake up at night screaming and crying, terrified, and did not . want to go to school.' The parents filed multiple police reports and met with school officials but no progress was made. They added that the accused bully's parents said the boy had 'anger issues.' The family claims Joaquin's mother was fired from her school cafeteria job in retaliation for the suit . 'The school said they were taking action and assured us . it wouldn't happen again, and it would just keep happening,' said Joaquin's . father. '(They would say) 'Yes we'll handle it, rest assured…' and . then it would happen again a week later!' Attorney Joel Handler said he was seeking monetary damages for the family, with a judgement against even the grade school perpetrator. 'He has committed multiple assaults, . multiple batteries, on my client,' Handler said. 'Since the school's . not going to address it, and the parent presumably are not going to . address it, then we are going to have to address it.' The young boy's future earnings could even be garnished to recover a judgement. Family attorney Joel Harden said a judgement could even result in the alleged bully having future wages garnished . 'That (potential) judgment is good . for 20 years,' Handler said. 'As long as we know where he is, we would be . enforcing the judgment against him.' Handler plans to amend the complaint to include a charge of retaliatory discharge naming the school for firing Joaquin's mother. 'This isn't just about our son any . more,' she told reporters.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The origins of Little Red Riding Hood have been traced back 2,000 years by scientist. A Victorian image is pictured . The origins of Little Red Riding Hood have been traced back 2,000 years by scientists. And they believe finding the roots of other folk tales could show how humans migrated throughout history. Using techniques pioneered by evolutionary biologists, the new study reveals the folk tale first appeared in a spoken version called The Wolf and the Kids, which is still told in some countries. Today the two stories are distinct, although their shared root has evolved into a number of different stories told in Africa and Asia since the original yarn first appeared in Europe in the first century AD. Experts at Durham University used mathematical modelling to plot the 'evolutionary tree' of The Wolf and the Kids - a tale about a wolf that impersonates a nanny goat and eats her young. They found the British favourite Little Red Riding Hood, whose wolf character devours a young girl in a similar deception, branched off around 1,000 years along the evolutionary tree. It evolved as a spoken story in France, Austria and northern Italy before being written down by French author Charles Perrault in the 1600s and was later re-told in its most familiar form by the Brothers Grimm, 200 years ago. While The Wolf and the Kids - which is popular in Europe and the Middle East -  was evolving from spoken word to the printed tale of Little Red Riding Hood in Europe, it travelled south to Africa and eastwards to Asia to become The Tiger Grandmother in Japan, China and Korea. Because the tale spent much of its early existence as a spoken story, it was difficult to trace back through time, as there are no written versions that could give researchers a reference point of date and place. Experts at Durham University used mathematical modelling to plot the 'evolutionary tree' of The Wolf and the Kids and found the British favourite Little Red Riding Hood, whose wolf character devours a young girl in a similar deception, branched off around 1,000 years along the evolutionary tree . Durham anthropologist Dr Jamshid Tehrani, used a technique called phylogenetics - a mathematical modelling system - to compare 72 areas of similarity between 58 variations of the folk tale collected from around the world. The method is used by biologists for grouping closely-related organisms to map their evolution, but it helped him build a 'tree' that revealed the most likely branches, or paths, that the various versions took through time and revealed a surprising coincidence. Dr Tehrani explained: 'This is rather like a biologist showing that humans and other apes share a common ancestor but have evolved into distinct species. An illustration based on the fable The Wolf and the Kids, which highlights the dangers of talking to strangers . 'My research cracks a long-standing mystery. The African tales turn out to be descended from The Wolf and the Kids but over time, they have evolved to become like Little Red Riding Hood, which is also likely to be descended from The Wolf and the Kids. 'This exemplifies a process biologists call convergent evolution, in which species independently evolve similar adaptations. 'The fact that Little Red Riding Hood ‘evolved twice’ from the same starting point suggests it holds a powerful appeal that attracts our imaginations.' His findings, published in the Public Library of Science journal PLOS ONE, also overturned the theory believed by some that a forerunner to Little Red Riding Hood originally came from the Far East. 'It is claimed the tale spread west, along the Silk Route, and gave rise to both The Wolf and the Kids and the modern version of Little Red Riding Hood, Dr Tehrani said. 'My analysis demonstrates that in fact the Chinese version is derived from European oral traditions, and not vice versa. 'Specifically, the Chinese blended together Little Red Riding Hood, The Wolf and the Kids and local folktales to create a new, hybrid story. 'This implies that the Chinese version is not derived from literary versions of Little Red Riding Hood but from the older, oral version, with which it shares crucial similarities,' he said. Dr Tehrani added that applying the technique to other folk tales could reveal how humans migrated throughout history, by tracing the folk stories’ origin in time and geographically. The tale of The Wolf and The Kids morphed into a German fable by the Brothers Grimm and is about a mother goat who leaves her kids at home but warns them not to open the door to a wolf who might impersonate her high voice. She says they can also recognise her by her white feet, but the wolf covers himself in flour so he has white feet and mimics her voice, enters the house and eats all except the smallest of the kids. The mother finds the wolf and cuts him open with a pair of scissors and her young spring out unharmed. She fills the wolf's stomach with rocks before sewing him up and the wolf is so thirsty, he goes to drink in a stream and drowns, while the family of goats live happily ever after. The tale of The Grandmother Tiger features a similar warning about strangers. A mother leaves her two children at home in a quiet village while she goes out on a long journey to get food and tells the children not to let strangers inside while she is away over night. But in the village there lives a bad tiger with a penchant for eating children. The big cat dresses up as a grandmother and in the middle of the night, eats the younger child. Realising the grandmother is really the tiger, the older, wiser child runs outside to wait for the mother to return.","The original yarn, upon which Little Red Riding Hood was based, first appeared in Europe in the first century AD .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . In prison: Masood Ahmad, 72, was filmed reading the Qur'an by two men posing as patients, before they beat him . A 72-year-old British doctor has been imprisoned in Pakistan for ‘posing as a Muslim’ after two men pretending to be patients recorded him reading the Koran. Masood Ahmad, a member of the Ahmadiyya community, was arrested in Lahore last month after the two men had 'dragged him out by the neck' and beaten him. Mr Ahmadi spent a majority of his life working as a doctor in London, but returned to Pakistan in 1982 to open a pharmacy. According to Pakistani law, Ahmadis are non-Muslims and can be jailed for three years for 'posing as a Muslim' or 'outraging Muslims' feelings'. Mr Ahmad's brother says two men posing as patients questioned him about his faith and used mobile phones to secretly record him reading a verse from the Koran. ‘He said to him ""you are like a father to me, please help me with some questions"",’ Nasir Ahmad said. ‘When my brother answered, they began beating him and dragged him outside by his neck.’ Masood Ahmad has had three unsuccessful bail hearings, but remains behind bars. One hearing was picketed by scores . chanting anti-Ahmadi slogans and his lawyer was allegedly too frightened to attend the other two. His . son, one of seven children in Britain and Australia, said the family . suspected someone was trying to steal his father's dispensary. ‘I . feel so angry because I can't do anything from here,’said 39-year-old . Abbas Ahmad, a cab driver in Glasgow. ‘It's awful to know that people . were plotting against someone you love.’ One of his accusers, religious teacher Muhammad Ihsan, says Ahmad had preached to them illegally. The Ahmadi community has suffered from religious persecution for decades. Last year, 20 cases against Ahmadis alleged that they 'posed as Muslims', despite the group proclaiming Islam to be their faith. One case saw a bank clerk arrested for wearing a ring with a Quranic verse and in another an . entire family was charged for writing a Muslim greeting on a wedding . invitation. Persecuted: The Ahmadi are considered non-Muslims under Pakistani law and they can be jailed for three years if they are seen ''posing as a Muslim' or even upsetting another Muslim (stock image) Clerics have . twice sought the arrest of an entire town of Ahmadis, 60,000 people, for . holding religious celebrations. Residents were serving food, giving out . sweets and displaying bunting, the complaints said. ‘We . would not have a problem with them if they did not use the name of . Islam and the symbols of Islam,’ said Tahir Ashrafi, head of the . powerful Ulema Council of clerics. ‘We . are against the killing of any innocent. Such attacks are not . acceptable or allowed, but if they break the law, we have a right to go . to the police,’ he said. There are about half a million Ahmadis . in Pakistan, their leaders say. Many only feel safe in Rabwa, a town . they bought when Pakistan was created in 1947. On its main streets, banks of security cameras monitor fruit vendors and dozing dogs. The Ahmadiyya community are persecuted in Pakistan and elsewhere and are considered non-Muslims under Pakistani law. Their status as 'non-Muslim' is recorded on their passports and they can be jailed for several years if they are caught 'posing as a non-Muslim'. The Ahmadi differ from mainstream Islam in that they do not believe Muhammad is the final prophet. There are several Muslim clerics who preach that a man who kills an Ahmadi earns a place in heaven. Targeted attacks on Ahmadi Muslims are on the rise, last year 20 Ahmadis were murdered, up from 11 in 2009. Near the playing fields, blocks of flats house families that fled other parts of Pakistan after loved ones were murdered. Rafiatta, who asked her last name not be used, moved to Rabwa after gunmen killed her husband in 2010 in front of their young children. ‘He was just a hard-working man who loved his family,’ she said. The family fled after two Ahmadi neighbours were also killed and men tried to kidnap Raffiata's young son. The Ahmadi are also targets outside Pakistan. In Indonesia, a gruesome YouTube video recorded a mass lynching in 2011 as police looked on. Ahmadi publications are banned in Bangladesh, where a festival site was torched earlier this year. In Britain, Ahmadi buildings have been vandalised and leaflets have appeared forbidding them to enter shops and urging Muslims to kill them, British media have reported. But Pakistan is the epicentre of persecution. Last April, a 25-year-old hospital clerk and his father were at home in Lahore reading an Ahmadi newspaper when a crowd broke down their door, the clerk said. They beat the two and looted their home. Then a gunman forced the pair into a car without license plates, the clerk said. He asked not to be named for fear of retribution. Their kidnappers went free but the two were eventually charged with impersonating Muslims in special anti-terrorist courts designed to combat the Taliban. The clerk was released after a month, but his father, who has not yet been convicted, has been in prison for nine months.The family has since fled their home and the man now occupying it is refusing to pay them for it. ‘Nobody has the courage to give him bail or dismiss the case,’ the clerk said.","Masood Ahmad was beaten up by two men pretending to be patients .

The bird man was seized at Ignacio Agramonte International Airport in the Cuban city of Camaguay and was picked up because of the curious bulges in his trousers. After being stopped by customs, the man bizarrely claimed he was only concealing a pigeon as a gift for his grandson. Bust: Ignacio Agramonte International Airport in the Cuban city of Camaguay arrested a traveler after noticing a suspicious 'bulge' in his pants . Customs officers found dozens of birds including hummingbirds, like the one pictured, down the trousers of a man they stopped in Ignacio Agramonte International Airport, Cuba (file picture) But after he was forced to remove his trousers, officers found dozens of 'frightened little finches and hummingbirds' - some with their beaks sealed shut so they would not be heard singing. All the birds were rare species and had probably been stolen to order for the equivalent of thousands of pounds, police said. The smuggler nearly made it on to the aircraft after a metal detector failed to pick up his feathered contraband. But because of the unusual bulges, and the slow way in which he was walking, a customs officer Hermogenes Yonsiver decided to take him into an inspection room for a body search. 'As soon as he knew the game was up he tried to lie his way out of it and say he was carrying a pigeon,' said officer Yonsiver. 'He said: ""What I have here is a pigeon that is a gift for my grandson"" but that too was a lie. He then wanted to continue on his way. Similar case: In 2011, a Dutch traveler was arrested at Rochambeau airport in Cayenne, French Guiana, for trying to smuggle more than a dozen live hummingbirds in special pouches sewn into his underwear (pictured) 'But he was forced to take down his trousers, and we found all these frightened little finches and hummingbirds, some of whom had their beaks sealed shut so that we wouldn't hear their singing.' Two of the birds stashed near his genitals were dead when police ordered him to strip. Police say the man is still being questioned and faces up to two years in prison.

"By . Chris Greenwood . Dozens of secret files that could hold vital clues about police corruption in the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry were never disclosed to an investigation into the case, it has emerged. A total of 41 boxes of documents – sent to the national archives at Kew several years ago – were not examined by the officials behind a damning review published last week. Mark Ellison QC, whose findings prompted Home Secretary Theresa May to order a public inquiry into undercover policing methods, became aware of the existence of the boxes only as he was preparing to publish his report this week, and did not have time to look at them. On February 14 1997 (left), Daily Mail accused Gary Dobson, Neil Acourt, Jamie Acourt, Luke Knight and David Norris of the murder of teenager, Stephen Lawrence (right) Some of the files are so sensitive . they carry warnings saying they cannot be viewed until the end of the . century. But they could be unsealed as part of the public inquiry into . undercover policing ordered last week by Mrs May. Furthermore, . the documents could be even more important because other vital . paperwork was shredded by the Met more than a decade ago. The .

There . were hopes last night the files at Kew could contain evidence against . former Detective Sergeant John Davidson over his actions as the murder . inquiry began. The former . officer is suspected of links to the gangland father of one of the . Lawrence suspects but the Met has previously denied he was involved. However, documents emerged at the weekend showing he tasked junior . officers in the key initial stages of the 1993 inquiry. Mrs . May, who has been personally shocked by the revelations, has pledged to . bring in a new criminal offence of police corruption. Senior . officers have promised they will get to the bottom of corruption . allegations for the first time, after years of denial and botched . attempts. Dr Richard Stone, a . member of Sir William Macpherson’s team who first probed the Lawrence . murder in 1999, warned Mr Ellison about the missed documents. He . said: ‘He was unaware of the documents at the National Archive and said . he would not have time to look  at them before his report came out.  I . have seen some of the documents at Kew and they are very interesting. Some clearly have very important information in them but restrictions . mean they won’t be released for 84 years.’ It is not clear exactly what restrictions have been put in place on the files, and why. Dr . Stone remains convinced that the Macpherson inquiry was hampered from . getting to the truth about the killing of the black teenager and is . considering calling for an inquiry into the way civil servants handled . information relating to the case. He . added: ‘Now I am almost certain that senior Home Office civil servants . played “Yes, Minister” games with us from the very beginning of the . inquiry.’ The existence of . the forgotten documents emerged as the authorities came under huge . pressure to finally take decisive action in the aftermath of the Ellison . report. It found officers spied on the Lawrence family, with an . undercover officer passing on personal details such as comments on the . separation of Stephen’s parents. Home Secretary Theresa May ordered a public inquiry into undercover policing methods following the review, but it was revealed that the heavily censored hoard of information was not available to Mark Ellison's inquiry team. Now it has been revealed that unexamined evidence could be more important than the shredded evidence . Officials . also raised concerns about the Met’s record-keeping on its own . investigations into police corruption, with key evidence destroyed 11 . years ago. The focus is now . on the potential damage inflicted to the Lawrence murder inquiry by . corrupt officers linked to the unsolved murder of private investigator . Daniel Morgan. Met chief Sir .

"By . Harry Mount . When Adolf Hitler was raining bombs down on the East End of London during the Blitz, W.F. Arber & Co, a much-loved printworks, kept going. An oil bomb hit the print-shop’s back garden but the presses in the shop basement in Roman Road, Bow, kept on rolling. An incendiary bomb landed in the cistern of the outside lavatory too, but only succeeded in burning off the roof. In another raid, Albert Arber, an auxiliary fireman in the evenings when he wasn’t at his daytime printing job, was killed by a collapsing wall hit by a bomb. And, still, the presses did not stop. W.F. Arber & Co, a much-loved printworks in Roman Road, Bow, has been forced to close its doors after 117 years due to heavy parking fines and high business rates given out by Tower Hamlets Council . The oldest printing shop in the East End, it has been in business since 1897 — printing pamphlets for Emmeline Pankhurst, leader of the Suffragettes, at the turn of the century. But last month, Gary Arber, 82, finally shut up the shop that his grandfather, Walter Arber, built in the final years of Queen Victoria’s reign. Hitler couldn’t stop the Arbers — but Tower Hamlets Council’s parking policy has. After 60 years of running the family shop, Mr Arber has now retired along with his wife — who used to work in the shop, selling toys — to their home in Romford in Essex. Even if there had been a viable business to take over, there are no Arber children to run the business. ‘The buck stops with me,’ he says. In Mr Arber’s shopfront window, sits a forlorn printed notice — one of his last printing jobs. It reads: ‘Advance Notice – This shop will be closing at the end of May. We have been here for 117 years, printed for the Suffragettes, survived enemy bombing through two World Wars and now we are finished due to Tower Hamlets Council’s  parking policy’. A spy camera on a pole nearby issues fines to every customer who stops outside in a car — and the shop no longer earns enough to pay the council’s high business rates. Even a local church minister was fined £65 when she stopped her car outside to pick up two heavy boxes of paper for her church. There is a bay outside Mr Arber’s premises that promises 20 minutes’ free parking for loading. But two spy cameras at either end of a stretch of Roman Road snap away every five minutes — and if the car is not actually being loaded when those photos are taken, a £130 fine (halved if paid promptly) wings its way to the poor unsuspecting customer. ‘Once bitten, they just don’t come back again,’ says a wistful Gary Arber, a sprightly, jocular figure with fond tales of old East End life. Onwer Gary Arber, from Romford, had to pay a £2,000 instalment of the £6,300 annual business rates - money he couldn't afford as parking rates had put off customers . ‘It’s been bad for the last ten years or so, ever since the council introduced harsher parking restrictions. Once, it was possible to park everywhere round here for free. The rates used to be manageable but now they just don’t make sense. ‘The council makes more than we do out of the shop.’ Tragically, Arber & Co is not the only small firm to be brought to its knees by the army of council parking wardens across the country. Figures show £150,000 of spot fines are issued by councils daily thanks to CCTV cameras. And in the last five years, town halls gave out £310 million in traffic and parking fines. The final straw for Mr Arber came last October when he had to pay a £2,000 instalment of the £6,300 annual business rates. But the firm — crippled by a lack of customers, sparked by the council’s parking policy — was no longer able to pay its way. Mary Portas — TV’s Mary, Queen Of Shops — visited recently in a bid to help the businesses of Roman Road. But she couldn’t save Arber & Co. And so Mr Arber had to make the tragic decision to pull the shutters down on more than a century of family history. The property developer who bought the building from him will convert it into flats. Founder Walter Arber began the business as a paper-bag maker to satisfy the demand for bags printed with shop details, in newly-built premises. His wife, Emily, sold toys there too. This pattern — of a Mr Arber doing the printing and a Mrs Arber selling toys — continued for three generations right until Gary Arber’s day. You can still make out the faded adverts for Scalextric cars and Chopper bicycles (‘For trendy shoppers’), pasted onto the original Victorian timber shop fittings. The counter has been rubbed away into a smooth, gentle dip by a million transactions; one glass-fronted cabinet has a wooden edge nibbled away by the punctures from a thousand drawing pins. During World War I, the business, which had expanded into bookbinding, remained open, and in the 1930s, Walter Arber designed a new paper tea package. The business flourished in World War II, thanks to government printing contracts — fulfilled even as the Blitz began. ‘The shop garden was destroyed by an oil bomb and the high wall flattened the garden,’ says Gary Arber. ‘My grandparents had a lucky escape as they only got out of the Anderson shelter before the wall came down on it.’ Albert, his volunteer firefighter uncle, wasn’t so lucky. One of the printing presses in action. Mary Portas - TV's Mary, Queen Of Shops - visited recently in a bid to help the businesses of Roman Road - but she couldn't help the business . ‘He was manning a pump just round the corner, when a bomb brought a wall down and killed him. ‘His wife was pregnant with his first child, who he never saw. A blue plaque marks the spot where he died.’ Mr Arber has removed his historic presses from the basement. They ranged from a 1900 Wharfedale press to a 1952 Glockner Mercedes. Trays of type still remain in his first-floor office — like all master printers, Mr Arber can still read print backwards as it lies set in metal. On his desk sits a page of metal print, set in 1950, that reads, ‘Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries: TB testing.’ Among the equipment the Arbers owned was a 1939 Heidelberg press. ‘My father bought it,’ says Mr Arber, ‘We were about to pay the Germans when war broke out. We paid the British government instead. I never found out if they paid the Germans later.’ Most of the presses have been taken to Catseye Press, in Happisburgh, Norfolk, to form part of a private collection of vintage printing machines. But one remains – the 1900 Golding press on which the Arbers printed leaflets for the Suffragettes. This press is to go on show at the Bishopsgate Institute in the City. ‘My grandmother was a Suffragette,’ says Mr Arber, ‘She made my grandfather do their printing for free.’ The printing presses, one pictured, at the business helped print pamphlets for the suffragettes during the fight for the vote. Mr Arber remembers talking to his grandmother about the Suffragettes, he says . Mr Arber remembers talking to his grandmother about the Suffragettes. ‘I think she was the muscle for the movement,’ he says, smiling, ‘I was telling her a story about how the Kray twins pushed someone into a canal, and she said she’d done the same for the Suffragettes.’ The Krays also used to get their printing done for their boxing promotions at Arber & Co. ‘The twins were decent blokes,’ says Mr Arber, ‘If anyone mugged an old lady around here, they ended up on the wrong side of the twins. They had standards.’ By the time the Krays hit the East End, Gary Arber was running the family firm. His father died in 1954, at the age of 53, and Gary had to give up a career in the RAF, to run it. ‘As the business was still employing a large staff and family members, I had to buy myself out of my very happy RAF career,’ he says, ‘I have been stuck here since then.’ Mr Arber isn’t a sentimental man but you can sense a sadness beneath his chirpy exterior. ‘I was happy to carry on working,’ he says, ‘I don’t like being beaten.’ You can see why. If your family has seen off Hitler — and the Kaiser — it’s deeply depressing to be killed off by the parking czars of a tinpot council.","W.F.

The group of 20 women teamed up with singer Camilla Kerslake and vocal trio Blake to record the moving cover of ‘You Raise Me Up’. Scroll down for video . Sharon Malyan, 55, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004 and had to have a year of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She believes that if her cancer had been diagnosed any later she would not still be here . Mrs Malyan, from Coulsdon, in the London Borough of Croydon, told MailOnline: ‘It’s been the most amazing and uplifting experience. ‘It was a wonderfully moving experience and I am honoured to be a small part of it.’ Mrs Malyan was diagnosed with breast cancer in October 2004 after doctors found two tumours. Mrs Malyan (pictured during her treatment) has joined the Sing to Beat Breast Cancer Choir which is releasing a cover of 'You Raise Me Up' to raise money for Breast Cancer Campaign . She says she was suffering from . extreme tiredness but was in a state of denial so did not notice one of . her breasts had grown and that it had a dimple on it. She . was only diagnosed when the breast started to ache prompting her to . visit her GP who gave her an emergency referral for further tests. She . said: ‘I was so lucky as if I had left it any longer I don’t think I’d . still be here today because the cancer had already started to spread to . the lymph nodes.’ Mrs Malyan, who was a co-ordinator for Croydon Adult Education when she was diagnosed, had two courses of chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy. In all, her treatment lasted for a year. As a result of her experience, Mrs Malyan is retraining as a Reiki teacher and will specialise in working with people with cancer. She is also helping to raise money and awareness about breast cancer. Mrs Malyan (pictured during treatment) said: 'It's been the most amazing and uplifting experience. It was a wonderfully moving experience and I am honoured to be a small part of it.' Mrs Malyan said: 'I was so lucky as if I had left it any longer I don't think I'd still be here today because the cancer had already started to spread to the lymph nodes' She said: ‘I want to help change the quality of life of people with cancer. ‘Wouldn’t it be amazing if we could find a way of preventing it? My belief is you don’t just pay back – you pay forward. We can not just move mountains – we can make miracles happen. ‘I feel as though I have been saved and I want to make that survival count.’ As a result of her involvement with breast cancer fundraising she heard about the Sing to Beat Breast Cancer Choir which is raising money for the charity Breast Cancer Campaign. The lead singer in the choir is Camilla Kerslake who became an ambassador for Breast Cancer Campaign after her mother suffered from the disease . The Sing To Beat Breast Cancer Choir (pictured) is made up of 20 women who have, or have had, breast cancer. They sang with singer Camilla Kerslake and vocal trio, Blake . The lead vocals in the choir is singer Camilla Kerslake who became an ambassador for Breast Cancer Campaign after her mother suffered from the disease. She said: ‘When my mother finally regained her health, after nearly two years of operations, procedures and a string of debilitating complications, my first thought was “what can I do to repay the people who saved her?”. ‘Having been asked by Breast Cancer Campaign to record a single for them I knew I had to choose a song that would be relevant. ‘”You Raise Me Up” is an incredibly poignant, yet uplifting song about what you can achieve when someone you love supports you. The single will be released on Sunday and 50p from every sale will go to Breast Cancer Campaign to pay for research into the disease . ‘I chose it because, in a way, it reflects the struggle our wonderful survivors’ choir, and cancer sufferers everywhere, face daily. ‘The song’s message is one of hope, strength and unity - traits we must all employ in the on-going fight against breast cancer.’ She added: ‘I wanted to create a choir of women directly affected by breast cancer because I believe both music and a sense of belonging can be immensely healing. ‘I wanted to share the joy I feel on stage and provide them with an enjoyable way to give back. Ms Kerslake invited Blake (pictured with Ms Kerslake) - Humphrey Berney, Ollie Baines and Stephen Bowman - to collaborate with her on the single . ‘I cannot state fully enough how proud I am of all that the choir has achieved, they have overcome the most horrendous odds, joined together and raised their voices in song to save future generations from the ravages of breast cancer.’ Ms Kerslake invited Blake - Humphrey Berney, Ollie Baines and Stephen Bowman - to collaborate with her on the single. They said: ‘We are thrilled to be singing on the single and were honoured when Camilla asked us to be part of something that is so very close to her heart. ‘We all personally know people who have been affected by breast cancer and having heard about Camilla’s mother’s battle with cancer and what her family have gone through we wanted to be involved and to try and make a difference.’ The song can be downloaded from iTunes from Sunday and 50p from every download will go to Breast Cancer Campaign to help fund research into the disease. Mrs Malyan said: ‘I am just hoping that everyone will jump on board to support it. ‘It has been an amazing experience working with Camilla and the boys from Blake – it has been a privilege. ‘They were all so kind and encouraging.’","Sharon Malyan was diagnosed with breast cancer in October 2004 .

"By . Aaron Sharp . Don't be put off by their rather curious appearance. Black tomatoes are being grown in Britain for the first time – and they could have the potential to stave off cancer. The fruit is among the first in the world to contain anthocyanins, an antioxidant believed to help fight cancer, diabetes and obesity. The tomato’s jet black colour stems from pigments in its skin which develop when exposed to sunlight. UK first: The jet black tomatoes, grown by Ray Brown from Pant World in Newton Abbot, Devon, are the only of their kind in the country . Plant man: Expert Ray, above, was sent the seeds by a customer and was staggered when the fruit grew jet black on the vines . Ray Brown, 66, who runs Plant World Seeds, first came across the unusual fruit when a customer sent him a mystery package entitled 'black tomato'. Confused by the enigmatic the label, he sowed the product and was stunned at the resulting black tomatoes which appeared. Mr Brown, from Newton Abbot, Devon, said: 'A customer sent us some seeds just named 'black tomato' last winter and we couldn't believe that they were real so we sowed them in the spring to see. 'We are always looking for something original. Nobody has every produced black tomatoes, the closest they have got are brown ones and orange ones. 'It was always something people thought was impossible, we thought it was an April Fool's Day hoax. 'But when we grew them we realised they were jet black, we were absolutely staggered. 'They are completely new, as far as I'm aware they have never, ever been grown in this country before.' The tomatoes are believed to have been . developed at Oregon State University, in America, forming part of their . 'Indigo Rose' project. They . are ripe when their colour changes from a shiny blue-purple to an . almost jet black, with the bottoms of the tomatoes turning red. The dark version of the fruit rich high in beneficial anthocyanins, which are compounds found in . fruits, vegetables and beverages. Some believe the anti-oxidant can help with . diabetes, cancer and obesity. They aroused interest of the scientific community after their powerful health boosting effects were discovered during American lab tests. Unusual: The colour, a result of a genetic mutation, makes the fruit richer in health boosting anti-oxidants that its red cousin . Strong: Ray said he has eaten lots of his black tomatoes, describing them as having a 'good, strong' flavour. Mr Brown has a total of three plants, each containing 20 tomatoes which have black skins but are red on the inside. 'No one can quite believe what we've got, they keep asking if it's a joke, or if they're edible' he said. 'They . are edible, we've eaten lots, they have a nice taste and a really . lovely flavour. The only way to describe it is a good, strong tomatoey . taste.' 'The fruit is also unique because it doesn't use genetic engineering to create it' added Mr Brown, who currently has no plans to market the black tomatoes. 'It is entirely done by selection techniques.'","Super-fruit is high in health boosting anti-oxidant anthocyanins .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . England is the only country in the UK that still 'taxes' for medication . The ‘outdated and iniquitous’ NHS prescription charge should be scrapped, a GP has said. England remains the only country in the UK still stumping up for the ‘tax’ on medicines. The latest figures for 2012 show that 80 per cent of those aged 18 to 59 had to pay for their drugs. The £8.05 charge compares starkly with the cost of many commonly prescribed drugs that are now off patent, according to Dr James Cave, editor of the journal Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin. There are a host of exemptions to the charge – including age and pregnancy – but these extend to unrelated conditions. In an editorial, Dr Cave said many exemptions appear ‘illogical’. He added: ‘It is time that politicians showed their commitment to a patient-centred NHS and abolished prescription charges in England.’ The prescription charge has long been a contentious issue, says DTB, and even contributed to the resignation of Aneurin Bevan, the architect of the NHS, in 1951. Since then, various calls have been made for a fundamental review of the charge, including from patient organisations, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, and the BMA. Several alternative arrangements have been suggested, including getting the patient to pay for drugs at cost plus a reasonable dispensing fee to the pharmacist, which, incidentally is how private prescriptions can be dispensed, says DTB. Although fees for private prescriptions vary widely, they can actually end up being cheaper than an NHS prescription. Another anomaly is that while VAT is not paid on prescriptions dispensed in the community, NHS trusts have to pay the full 20 per cent levy on medicines dispensed from a hospital pharmacy. Dr Cave said this may contribute to 'perverse prescribing decisions' which don't serve the patient well. 'Iniquitous': Figures reveal 80 per cent of patients aged 18-59 paid £8.05 for medication in 2012 . He added: 'As a cost saving measure, many hospitals discourage doctors in outpatient departments from prescribing medicines to patients sitting in front of them in their clinic. 'Instead they are asked to write to the patient's GP recommending the prescription.' He said this means the patient has to contact their GP to get the drugs they need before taking the prescription to a local pharmacy, which the DTB describes as 'clearly very inefficient and hardly patient-centred.' Dr Cave added: 'Charges are clearly outdated and iniquitous, and we believe it is time that politicians showed their commitment to a patient-centred NHS and abolish prescription charges in England.'","England is the only country in the UK still taxing for medicines .

"By . Associated Press . The first Iditarod musher hit the trail in unseasonably warm conditions yesterday as the legendary sled race kicked off in Alaska. Temperatures were in the high teens as'The Last Great Race on Earth' began, but even that seemed a little on the summery side for seasoned mushers as Alaska experiences one of its warmest winters on record. 'Too warm for dogs,' said competitor Eric Noble of Eagle River, Alaska. Scroll down for video . Runner up: Aliy Zirkle of Two Rivers, Alaskawaves to fans at the start of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race on Sunday. Zirkle has come in second place for the last two Iditarods and hopes to clench a win this eyar . In addition to the relative warmth, a slew of foreign born competitors from as far afield as Jamaica and Australia are among this year's competitors. New Zealander Curt Perano began . the world's most . famous sled-dog race by crossing frozen Willow Lake about 50 miles north . of Anchorage in a race some locals say has been 'invaded' by foreigners . this year. Five Norwegian mushers are competing this year along with the Kiwi starter, all of them facing 1,000 miles of unforgiving Alaska terrain, including two . mountain ranges, untamed wilderness, the mighty Yukon River and the . wind-whipped Bering Sea coast. It was a staggered start, meaning one musher left every two . minutes. The order was drawn at a musher's banquet Thursday night in Anchorage. The finish line is on Front Street in Nome, which runs . parallel to the Bering Sea coast. Among those in the field are Mitch Seavey, last year's . champion, and his son, Dallas Seavey, the 2012 winner. ‘The last two winners might create more media interest,’ Dallas Seavey said before the race started. ‘But it doesn't mean that we're . necessarily the two most competitive racers this year.’ Adding to the uncertainty of this year's race is an influx . of Scandinavian mushers, including two-time champion Robert Sorlie. ‘I don't think we're trying to take it over,’ Sorlie said. Instead, there are so many Scandinavians here because the . Iditarod is the world standard for long-distance dog races, he said. The influx of Norwegians, or ‘invasion’ as Yvonne . Dabakk of Oslo described it, is likely just a coincidence, she said. Defending champion: Mitch Seavey slaps hands with the crowd at the start of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race on Sunday in Willow.

Slew of Scandinavians: Fans of the Norwegian contingent of mushers cheer Tommy Jordbrudal, of Norway at the start of the Iditarod. Locals have suggested this year's race has been 'taken over' by such foreigners' Unseasonably warm: A sled dog takes advantage of unseasonably warm temperatures to get some sun from the hole in a kennel on a musher before the race began Sunday. Some fear the warmth will make for a grueling race . Long raod ahead: Aliy Zirkle's team runs across Willow Lake as the grueling 1,000-mile trek began . Old hat: Dallas Seavey leaves the start line before the start of the Iditarod, hoping to repeat his 2012 win . Dabakk said she believes all had independent plans to race . the Iditarod, ‘and it was this year.’ She is a rookie this year, and she wants the prize given to . all first-year mushers to finish the race: a belt buckle. If she gets it, the buckle goes to her husband. ‘Without . him, I couldn't be on the trail line at all, so I'm going to get him a buckle,’ Dabakk said. Aaron Burmeister wants to be the first musher from Nome to . win the Iditarod. We haven't had a winner from Nome yet. I'm working as hard . as I can to be able to do that,’ he said. Burmeister welcomes the return of the Norwegian mushers . because they bring more competition to the race. ‘When I win the Iditarod, I want to have the best . competition in the world there,’ Burmeister said.

Allen Moore of Two Rivers, Alaska, last month won his second . consecutive Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race. The conditions now are the . same as they were for the start of the Quest, he said. His wife, musher Aliy Zirkle, will be using this team on the . race while Moore races other dogs. Zirkle has finished second in the Iditarod the last two . years, and her team might give her the needed boost this year because trail . familiarity in the Yukon Quest. ‘Our dogs have gone over 1,000 miles, and they know what to . expect,’ Moore said . Newton Marshall of St. Anne, Jamaica, is another . international musher at the race. He's competing in his fourth Iditarod. Marshall's race strategy is simple: He just wants to finish . the race. He plans to take it slow and simple ‘and get to Nome,’ he said. When asked how his team looks, Marshall said: ‘My team looks . ... I'll find out on the trail.’ World class: Fans line up along the course for the start of the Iditarod, considered by most to be the gold standard of all long-distance dog sled races. That prestige has attracted racers from around the world this year . Getting pumped: Musher Monica Zappa of Wisconsin prepares her sled before the start of the Iditarod. The race will take mushers nearly a thousand miles to the finish line in Nome, on Alaska's western coast . The Sunday event in Willow followed a ceremonial start . Saturday in downtown Anchorage. At that fan-friendly event, mushers talked to . people and had their pictures taken for hours before taking their sleds on a . leisurely 11-mile (18-kilometer) run on urban trails in the city. The race turned serious Sunday. The Iditarod had a . late-afternoon start so fans from Fairbanks could get there. It was a beautiful day for fans at the restart of the race, . with temperatures in the high teens. ‘Too warm for dogs,’ said Eric Noble of Eagle River, Alaska.

"By . Associated Press . A California man attending a huge electronic music party in Las Vegas died Saturday morning after he was taken to a hospital. The Clark County coroner's office identified the Electric Daisy Carnival attendee as 24-year-old Montomery Tsang of San Leandro. His cause of death wasn't immediately announced. Tragic event: Tragedy marked the Electric Daisy festival. Montgomery Tsang of San Leandro, California, who was attending the event, died Saturday morning after being taken to the hospital . Festival of a different kind: Morgan Bonsall of Philadelphia holds a sign while posing for a photographer during a set by Henry Fong at the 18th annual Electric Daisy Carnival at Las Vegas Motor Speedway in Las Vegas, Nevada . Reputation: The festival used to be known as a place for drink, drugs and debauchery. These days people are better behaved but one person still died . Event producer Insomniac issued a statement saying it was 'deeply saddened' by the death and hoped attendees would do their part to keep the weekend-long gathering safe. Organizers estimate 134,000 people attended the opening night Friday. Las Vegas police say of nearly 250 mostly minor medical calls the first night, only five resulted in trips to the hospital. They also reported 29 drug-related felony arrests. The event was criticized in Los Angeles in 2010 after a 15-year-old girl's fatal drug overdose. Better behavior: Electric Daisy Carnival moved to Las Vegas four years ago from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum after the 2010 death of a 15-year-old attendee who was treated for drug intoxication . According to the Las Vegas Sun, Tsang collapsed in a parking lot outside the concert venue under unclear circumstances.

"By . Associated Press . The Mormon church has excommunicated the prominent founder of a Mormon women's group, Ordain Women, the organization announced Monday afternoon. Kate Kelly's former church leaders in Virginia notified her of the decision after weighing the high-profile decision overnight. She did not attend the disciplinary hearing Sunday by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, instead holding a vigil in Salt Lake City with about 200 supporters. As the leader of Ordain Women, Kelly is . accused of apostasy, which is repeated and public advocacy of positions . that oppose church teachings. Distressing: Kate Kelly wipes a tear from her face during a vigil Sunday in Salt Lake City. Church leaders informed her Monday she had been excommunicated . Mormon officials aren't discussing Kelly's case, but say that disciplinary hearings are held when members' actions contradict church doctrine and lead others astray. Kelly is one of two well-known Mormons facing excommunication. John Dehlin, an outspoken advocate for gays and the creator of a website that provides a forum for church members questioning their faith, has a meeting with his stake president in Logan on June 29 to discuss his case. Scholars who study the Mormon religion say Kelly and Dehlin are the most high-profile examples of excommunication proceedings since 1993. That year, the church disciplined six Mormon writers who questioned church doctrine, ousting five and kicking out a sixth temporarily. Jan Shipps, a retired religion professor from Indiana who is a non-Mormon expert on the church, said church leaders are practicing 'boundary maintenance,' using Kelly and Dehlin as examples to show people how far they can go in questioning church practices. Kelly said before the decision that she will always be Mormon. 'I don't feel like Mormonism is something that washes off,' she said. 'That identity is not something that they can take from me.' A Mormon church spokeswoman said apostates, as Kelly was accused of being, repeatedly advocate against church teachings and 'lead believers astray' She was shocked to find out earlier this month from her bishop that she is facing excommunication from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, of which she is a lifelong member. The leader of Ordain Women is accused of apostasy, defined as repeated and public advocacy of positions that oppose church teachings. Vigils to support Kelly were held in 17 countries, according to Ordain Women. 'I'm overwhelmed by the positive support, and I think it really demonstrates that this isn't just happening to one person,' Kelly said before the vigil started. 'This isn't just happening to me, but it feels like the entire Mormon feminist community is being put on trial.' Kelly, an international human rights lawyer, said she stands behind everything she has done since forming Ordain Women in 2013. The group advocates for gender equality in the faith, with the ultimate goal of allowing women in the lay clergy. Kelly insists that she has not spoken out against church leaders or church doctrine. Women can hold many leadership positions in church, but aren't allowed to be bishops of congregations or presidents of stakes. Stakes are made up of up to a dozen congregations, known as wards. The church's highest leaders, called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, are also all men. Ms Kelly had about 200 supports in Salt Lake City for the hearing that led to her excommunication . The church says only men serve in the lay clergy as prescribed in 'the pattern set by the Savior when it comes to priesthood ordination.' Mormon officials aren't discussing Kelly's case specifically. They say they are open to questions and sincere conversations about the faith, but that some members' actions 'contradict church doctrine and lead others astray.' 'In the Church, we want everyone to feel welcome, safe and valued, and of course, there is room to ask questions,' church spokeswoman Ally Isom said. 'But how we ask is just as important as what we ask. We should not try to dictate to God what is right for his Church.' Kelly's group drew rebukes from church leaders in April when they marched on church property in downtown Salt Lake City's Temple Square. The women asked to be allowed in a meeting reserved for members of the priesthood, which includes most males in the church who are 12 and older. Church leaders had previously told the group they wouldn't be let in and warned them not to disturb the faith's biannual general conference that weekend. Melissa Mayhew, 31, traveled about 40 miles from Orem to attend Sunday's vigil and to support Kelly's right to advocate. 'We are all of us people who see things that we would love to improve about the church that we love deeply and dearly,' Mayhew said. 'And we want to be able to actually have these conversations, even with people with whom we disagree.'","Kate Kelly ran Ordain Women, a group that sought to convince the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to give women leadership rules .

'There are kids out here who knew him and didn't know him,' Omarr Dillard, Elijah's uncle, told Mlive. 'But they understand what it means, and they are here doing things he is no longer able to do.' Missed: Elijah, six, passed away a few days after he was found unresponsive in his family's home . Since the . little boy passed away, Omarr and his wife Ta-Tanesha, have become . advocates against child abuse and, as well as the party, they are . organizing a walk and anti-child-abuse rally. 'I hate we had to experience this, but I thank God that he put it in our hands and we can go forward with it,' Dillard said. 'Elijah is our adrenaline.' He said it was emotional planning Elijah's party but that the family knows the boy would have loved it. 'It's . something that has to be done. It's something that we can't forget. We . want his name to live forever,' Omarr added to WNEM. Others at the birthday party paid tribute to the little boy. 'He . was one of the best kids. He sang a lot, he was never bad, it was sad . he got beat to death for no reason,' Londall Dillard, Elijah's cousin, . told WNEM. His family has also created youth basketball, dance teams and a cheerleading team to help youngsters in the community. Saginaw . police officers were . called to Elijah Dillard's home for a report that the boy was . unresponsive and they arrived to find the child, who was still . conscious, was covered in burns. He passed away days later. Grieving: Omarr Dillard, the little boy's uncle, organized the birthday party. He holds a sign bearing his pictures . Prosecutors charged Aki . Dillard, 39, with first-degree premeditated murder, felony murder, . torture and first-degree child abuse and he is being held without bond.

"By . Damien Gayle . U.S. Soccer's official twitter feed had a peculiarly childish riposte to Robin van Persie when he congratulated Nani for his sudden goal in the opening minutes of USA's clash with Portugal last night. Seconds after the strike, which picked up on a bad pass by a U.S. defender, Manchester United and Netherlands ace Van Persie tweeted: 'Yesss @luisnani great goal.' It prompted a terse reply from U.S. Soccer which read simply: '@Persie_Official #Lame.' Sour grapes? U.S. Soccer's curt response to Robin van Persie congratulating Nani on his goal . Goal: Nani celebrates after scoring the first goal during the group G preliminary round match between the USA and Portugal at the Arena Amazonia in Manaus last night . The curt tweet inspired thousands of responses, with many telling the Americans they were unlikely to ever enjoy World Cup success until they start calling the sport by its proper name. In the end, however, terminology notwithstanding, it looked as if USA might overpower Portugal and book their place in the last 16. At least it did until Cristiano Ronaldo's cross caught Varela's diving header put the teams even at 2-2 in the dying seconds. The United States soccer team were just seconds away from a historic win against Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal in Brazil on Sunday night that would have booked their place in the last 16 of the World Cup . Now the Americans may need at least a point Thursday against Germany to advance to the knockout stage. They could advance with a loss, depending on the result of the Portugal-Ghana game that will be played simultaneously.

"By . James Gordon . A search is underway for an escaped murderer in Arkansas. Timothy Buffington, 47, managed to flee from the Pine Bluff correctional facility during an assignment on Saturday evening. During his escape he held a woman hostage although she was able to get away unharmed. On the run: Timothy Buffington, 47, was serving a 20 year sentence in prison after he was convicted in 1999 of First-Degree Murder . Cops believe he is armed with a shotgun and a backpack full of ammunition. Buffington was convicted in 1999 of first degree murder in the death of his ex-wife, Rhonda Combs. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison and was set to be released in July 2018. The Arkansas Department of Corrections has called in numerous agencies from across the state to assist in the search for the convict but so far officers have not turned up any sign on the man. On the lookout: Timothy Buffington escaped from Pine Bluff prison (pictured). He is described as a white male, about 5 feet 6 inches tall and 182 pounds. He's 47 years old with a bald head. He has scars on his abdomen, and upper left arm . There has been no further information as how or why the Buffington escaped the Pine Bluff facility and police have instead deflected any questions by saying they are more focused on getting the suspect back into custody. A 24-hour search is in progress and officers have insisted that the search will not stop until Buffington is found and under arrest. He is considered armed and dangerous. Authorities have urged Pine Bluff area residents to be on high-alert and to call authorities immediately upon sighting the man .","Timothy Buffington, 47, escaped prison during a work assignment .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated  Press Reporter . A female Indian rhino calf born recently in New York was produced by artificial insemination using sperm from a now-dead Cincinnati Zoo rhino. Zoo officials call the calf, dubbed Monica, born June 5 at the Buffalo Zoo a victory for endangered species. The father was named Jimmy and died at the Cincinnati Zoo in 2004. His sperm was frozen, stored and later taken to Buffalo. Loving mother: Tashi with her calf Monica, whose father is a male called Jimmy who died 10 years ago . Long-awaited: Tashi rests with her new calf who was born after a 16-month gestation period . First descendant: Monica is the first offspring of Jimmy, who died at the Cincinnati Zoo in 2004 . The calf's 17-year-old mother is named Tashi. She previously conceived and successfully gave birth through natural breeding in 2004 and 2008. But her mate died, and Buffalo's new male Indian rhino hasn't reached sexual maturity. Zoo staff prioritized getting Tashi pregnant, because long intervals between pregnancies in rhinos can result in long-term infertility. Monica is the first offspring of the long-dead Jimmy, who never fathered any offspring during his lifetime. Rhino keeper Joe Hauser and vet Dr Kurt Volle worked closely with the Cinnicinatti Zoo's Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife (CREW) to plan the successful artificial insemination and to monitor Tashi during her 16-month gestation. Big baby: Monica weighed 144lb when she was born . Miracle baby: Jimmy¿s sperm was stored at -320°F in CREW¿s CryoBioBank¿ (pictured) in Cincinnati, before it was taken to Buffalo . Dedicated: Monica the rhino calf with head rhino keeper at Buffalo Zoo Joe Hauser and CREW Reproductive Physiologist Dr. Monica Stoops, her namesake . She was named after one of the veterinarians whose hard work helped bring her to life. 'Without Dr. Monica Stoops’ dedication to the species, and to the development of AI science, there is no doubt this calf would not be here today,' said Hauser. 'She has spent countless hours spear-heading research and technology for Indian rhino conservation and the Buffalo Zoo is excited to acknowledge that dedication and announce that the name of the calf is Monica.' Buffalo officials say the calf weighed 144 pounds at birth. They say there are only 59 Indian rhinos in captivity in North America and about 2,500 in the wild. 'We are excited to share the news of Tashi’s calf with the world as it demonstrates how collaboration and teamwork among the Association of Zoos & Aquariums (AZA) organizations are making fundamental contributions to rhino conservation,” said Dr Monica Stoops, Reproductive Physiologist at the Cincinnati Zoo’s CREW. 'It is deeply heartening to know that the Cincinnati Zoo's beloved male Indian rhino Jimmy will live on through this calf and we are proud that CREW's CryoBioBank continues to contribute to this endangered species' survival.'","The calf, named Monica, is the first born from sperm of a male who died 10 years ago .

"By . Ashley Collman . New York Rep Sean Patrick Maloney, 47, became the second openly-gay congressman to marry in office when he wed longtime partner Randy Florke, 51, in a ceremony on Saturday. The couple, who have been together for more than two decades, became engaged on Christmas Day after their youngest daughter wrote an endearing note to Santa, asking her two 'wonder-ful fathers get married'. Maloney, a Democrat who represents New York's 18th District, got married at home in Cold Spring, New York in a ceremony that was attended by more than 250 guests - including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Happy day: Rep Sean Patrick Mahoney (left), a Democrat who represents New York's 18th District, got married to longtime partner Randy Florke (right) on Saturday.

The ceremony was officiated by the Rev Shane Scott Hamblen and held at St Mary-in-the-Highlands Church, where locals gathered on the sidewalks outside to see the parade of political attendees. The newlyweds didn't speak to reporters at the ceremony or reception, but did issue a statement on the special day. 'Even after 22 years together, we're overwhelmed by how blessed we feel to celebrate this special day with out friends and family,' the couple said in a statement. 'Thank you to all our friends near and far for their love and support as we continue to fight to ensure all families can experience the joys of a lifetime commitment.'

'Santa, can you try making my wonder-ful fathers get married?': Florke popped the question to Maloney on Christmas Day, after their youngest-daughter wrote this heartwarming letter to Santa . Maloney became just the second congressman to get married in office, after former Massachusetts Rep Barney Frank wed two years ago. Maloney and Florke have three children together: son Reiniel, 24, and daughters Daley, 13, and Essie, 11. The girls wore matching black and white dresses to the ceremony, and for family pictures taken against the backdrop of the lower Hudson Valley. After the ceremony, the kids rode in their own convertible to the reception that was decorated with a sign reading 'our parents just got married'. It was little Essie that was most responsible for the big day, since she prompted her dads' engagement with a special letter to Santa.

'Santa can you try making my wonder-ful fathers get married, they are a loving couple!' Essie, 11, wrote in a letter on her dad's congressional stationary. She also asked for legs and two nerf guns. Florke, a real estate and design executive, took the wish to heart and popped the question to Maloney on Christmas morning. 'When we finished opening our presents, Randy just sort of disappeared from the room for a minute and then came back in, and I noticed that my oldest was filming on his camera - and it didn't even than I didn't figure it out,' Maloney told Buzzfeed earlier this year. Equality: Maloney and Florke issued a statement to mark their wedding, saying they will 'continue to fight to ensure all families can experience the joys of a lifetime commitment' 'I gave him a bag for Christmas, a suitcase to match our other bag, and it was a really obvious bag when he saw the label. So, I said, ""I’m giving you a really obvious gift. It’s a suitcase, but it comes with a proposal: I want to know if you will travel with me forever and marry me."" I think his first words were, ""Oh, Jesus."" But, then, of course, he’s like, ""Yes.""' Florke said. The newlyweds will unfortunately be skipping the traditional honeymoon since Maloney has a Tuesday primary to prepare for. He was elected to New York's 18th Congressional District in 2012, after narrowly winning against Republican Nan Hayworth. Before becoming a congressman, Maloney worked in state and national politics (including former President Bill Clinton), and ran a high-tech start-up.

"By . Darren Boyle . A pair of bogus brides recruited using Skype to take part in sham marriages in the UK have been jailed. Bulgarians Nadya Kamenova, 20, and Tamenuzhka Slavcheva, 21, were paid in total more than £4,000 to ‘marry’ two Pakistani men facing deportation. The young mothers were both flown to Manchester after being contacted online by sham marriage organisers. Tamenuzhka Slavcheva, left, was paid £1,000 to marry Muhammed Saleem, her friend Nadya Kamenova, right, had earlier married the gang's suspected ring-leader Mohammed Shahbaz, who is wanted by authorities . Now both women have been jailed after admitting conspiring to facilitate breach of UK immigration law. The women were locked up alongside fake groom, Muhammed Saleem, 28, who married Slavcheva in a ceremony observed by undercover borders officials, called in by suspicious staff, at Manchester Register Office last February. Saleem, from Rochdale, Lancs, paid Slavcheva £1,000 to marry him after his student visa was rescinded. Four days earlier, Saleem acted as a witness in the fake marriage of Mohammed Shahbaz to Nadya Kamenova. Muhammed Saleem, pictured, had earlier acted as a witness at the wedding of Kamenova and Shabaz . Mr Shahbaz, who has so far escaped arrest, is suspected of organising a number of other sham marriages. Manchester Crown Court heard that his bride Kamenova was recruited by her UK-based aunt, who is suspected of being another of the organisers, via Skype, and paid £3,400 for the job. Once over here, Kamenova helped make arrangements for her cousin Slavcheva’s arrival . David Toal, prosecuting, said: 'Before the accession of countries such as Bulgaria and Romania to the EU, most previous sham marriage cases involved ""brides"" from affluent countries like Holland, and invariably spent only a few days for the marriage in the UK before returning to their lives in their own country. 'Such transient passage within the UK, gave the marriages the obvious appearance of shams. 'By choosing brides from poor countries such as Bulgaria, the grooms could be confident that their brides would be more willing to remain within the UK for longer periods of time or come to the UK on repeated visits.' Michael Johnson, defending Saleem, 28, said he was an ‘industrious and law-abiding person’ who had not claimed benefits in the UK and ‘very much regrets’ his crime. Simon Nichol, defending Slavcheva, said she was a ‘naive young woman’. Recorder Bernadette Baxter, sentencing, ordered Kamenova and Saleem to serve 20 months behind bars, and Slavcheva to serve 12 months, saying the ‘extremely serious offences fundamentally undermine the legitimate immigration system’. Staff at Manchester Register Office, pictured, became suspicious about the wedding and called in undercover border officials who observed the sham wedding before pouncing .","Tamenuzhka Slavcheva received £1,000 to marry Muhammed Saleem .

Two others went back to the 1,424 pupil Waterhead Academy in Oldham, Greater Manchester, with what they believed was the correct length of skirt - but were sent home again because it was deemed to be the 'wrong' material. The pair missed up to three days of lessons due to the row. Skirting the issue: (Left to right) Jessie Mae Cavanagh, Olivia Jobson and Mia Bentley, who were sent home about the length of their skirts. Olivia and Mia later returned but were then told their garments were the 'wrong material' Today the mothers of Mia Bentley and Olivia Johnson, both 12, voiced their disgust at the school. Pub landlady Alyson Bentley, 40, said: 'I'm absolutely disgusted that Mia has had to be off school for three days over this. It's just so petty and a   really bad way of dealing with the issue. 'As far as I'm concerned the skirt is the required length but they say it rides up when she was walks or goes up the stairs - but all clothes can do   that in those circumstances. 'Whatever you're wearing your trousers or jeans or skirts will ride up when you sit down or move - you can't help that. That's no reason to make a girl   miss three days of school. 'Mia has tried other skirts but they are too long and too big. Sending them home is not right. Surely a detention or a warning would be more appropriate.' The row erupted earlier this month after the girls arrived at school for Monday classes. Teachers believed their knee length skirts were too high and   did not conform to its rules of 'a smart, distinctive and mature appearance'. Anger:  Left, Alyson Bentley with daughter Mia Bentley. The mother said: 'It's just so petty and a really bad way of dealing with the issue'. Right, Deborah Jobson and daughter Olivia Jobson . Olivia and Mia went back the next day but were sent home again after staff questioned the skirt's material. By Wednesday their parents went to the   school themselves to resolve the row.  Olivia was allowed back to class after she promised to keep pulling her skirt down to the right length, but Mrs Bentley failed to reach an agreement on   Mia's uniform and the youngster missed another day of school. When she was finally allowed to return after missing three days on Thursday June 12 she was put on school report - meaning teachers had to record a   comment on her skirt every lesson. The year 8 pupils, both of Oldham, are now so upset over the affair that their parents are considering transferring them to different schools. Olivia's mother Deborah Jobson, 41, a bookkeeper, said: 'It's ludicrous. The girls have basically been sent home for simply following the rules. The   skirts are quite clearly knee-length - I don't know who says which part of the knee it has to be. Waterhead Academy in Oldham, Greater Manchester, has defended its uniform policy . 'The school policy states knee-length black skirt and that's what this is. The policy has always been there and there's never been a problem until now. 'The punishment doesn't fit the crime. It's not proportionate. The girls have missed out on vital learning. 'People are saying we should follow the rules for our daughters but we are... It's atrocious the school will go to such lengths over a skirt not to   mention the time it took me to actually speak to someone about it. 'Mia and Olivia are both good kids. Olivia had an outstanding school report yet the staff seem happy to put them through all this and allow them to   miss days. Row: Alison Ziemniak with daughters Jessie Mae Cavanagh and Annie Jones . 'There's also no consistency either as Olivia said some of the teachers told her, her skirt was fine and there are other kids with skirts even   shorter.' 'If they're going to be pedantic, they need clear and concise rules on uniform. Saying its the wrong material makes them look undignified.' Mia said: 'I haven't done anything wrong. The staircases are open so teachers are saying people can look up your skirts.But I didn't do any of this on   purpose.' According to the school's website girls must wear a white blouse, black trousers or knee-length skirt, 'sturdy' black school shoes, tights and black or   grey socks. It adds: 'Our uniform tries to combine a smart, distinctive and mature appearance with value for money. It is important to us that our students have a   reputation for looking good and behaving well, both on and off our premises and we believe that our uniform helps us in that aim.' Findings from the school's most recent OFSTED inspection in March last year ruled that Waterhead Academy still required improvement after an inspection   in January which found GCSE scores were 'generally below average'. It has academy status.  Parents have taken to social media to criticise the school's decision on their skirt-length policy. One said: 'It's a shame the schools don't pay the   same attention and passion to bullying and truancy, etc instead of focusing and punishing silly little things like this, sort out the big issues.' Leigh Sharples added: 'They did exactly the same with our daughter. I went into school and they had me waiting two and half hrs before anybody would   see me. 'I'm appalled at what they are doing they need to deal with the issues that are serious in that school not the petty skirt situation. They have more   important things to sort out.' Waterhead Academy's community director Alison Taylor said school policy was for either parents to bring alternative uniform into school or pupils would   be sent home. She added: 'All parents and students are aware of the Academy's uniform policy. 'It is the responsibility of parents to send their children to school appropriately dressed. Students and parents are given an opportunity to resolve   issues with uniform should they arise.' Last week the headteacher of a secondary school where more than 250 girls were taken out of lessons because their skirts were too short defended the ‘uniform crackdown’. Dr Rory Fox, headteacher at Ryde Academy on the Isle of Wight, said the school’s uniform policy was being enforced as a matter of fairness in a letter sent to parents. He said: ‘We are preparing students for the world of work so it is important that we teach students about the importance of managing their appearance and working to a dress code. 'We have a number of female students who have recently said that they are coming under peer pressure to wear their skirts shorter than they feel comfortable. ‘It is not fair that girls should be made to feel uncomfortable when they are just following the uniform policy.' Many parents, however, were angry about the clampdown. Helen Smith, from Ryde, Isle of Wight, said her 14-year-old daughter Jade had been sent home twice on the same day, for having a skirt that was too short and then trousers that were too tight. The 39-year-old mother-of-two said: ‘It was an absolute joke. It has been a nightmare. ‘I just can’t understand why the school have decided to do it five weeks before the end of the year.'","Seven girls sent home from an academy in Oldham, Greater Manchester .

"By . Lucy Crossley . This is the shocking moment a 'stupid' teenager wearing just a pair of shorts risked his life by jumping 50ft from a bridge into a canal to cool off. The boy had managed to scramble up the curved arch of the Lowry footbridge at Salford Quays and was seen standing on the . top with two friends. As his friends looked on, the bare-chested teen, who has not been named, then leaped into the waters of the Manchester Ship Canal. It is not known whether the two other teenagers on the . bridge also jumped. 'Plain stupidity': This teenager climbed to the top of the Lowry footbridge in Salford Quays before jumping into the Manchester Ship Canal below . The boy's plunge was filmed by a passer-by, close to the BBC's northern headquarters, yesterday as temperatures across Greater Manchester reached 23C. This week is national Drowning Prevention Week, and although the canal is more than 25ft deep at the Quays the boy could easily have broken his neck. 'I’m astonished that young people would risk their lives in this way,' said Salford mayor Ian Stewart. 'Jumping off the side is dangerous enough but this is just plain stupidity. Danger: This week is national Drowning Prevention Week, and although the canal is more than 25ft deep at the Quays the boy could easily have broken his neck . 'I’d urge all parents in Salford to warn their children that jumping into the Quays is not a harmless and fun prank. It could kill or damage someone for life.' Fire service bosses called the stunt ‘truly shocking’. 'These reckless people are lucky they weren’t killed,' said Councillor Dave Acton, chairman of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Authority. 'Water might look tempting on a hot summer’s day, but you have no idea what lies beneath the surface. Leap: The boy then jumped into the waters of the Manchester Ship Canal as his friends looked on. It is not known whether the two other teenagers on the bridge also jumped . 'The temperature of most open water is extremely cold. It can send your body into shock and kill you - even in hot weather. 'Our crews have pulled countless young people from canals and reservoirs. They all thought they could cool off in the water, for some of them it was the last thing they did.' The footage emerged after teenagers in a separate incident at Salford Quays risked their lives by trying to untie a safety pontoon. The group of three boys and thee girls were then spotted jumping on the raft attached to the edge of the water.

"By . Darren Boyle . Sergeant Major Harry Gurung killed a married couple when he had a sneezing fit as he was overtaking them on his way to his army barracks, a court has heard . A former Gurkha was cleared of killing a married couple in a car crash when he suffered a sneezing fit at the wheel. Leading Gurkha Sergeant Major Harry Gurung, 45, sneezed four to five times as he overtook a car at 74mph on his way back to his barracks. He was accused of killing pensioners David and Mary Marshall when he clipped the rear of their Ford Ka - but a top expert on the common cold supported his claim that sneezes could be to blame. Professor Ronald Eccles, director of Britain’s Common Cold Centre, said it was 'impossible' for people to sneeze with their eyes open. And a jury found Gurung not guilty of causing death by dangerous driving and by careless driving. Professor Eccles, 66, who has been studying the common cold for more than 40 years, told the jury: 'A typical sneeze lasts for up to three seconds and both eyes always close during a sneeze. 'If Mr Gurung sneezed four times he would have been distracted by it for up to 12 seconds. 'His eyes would have been closed for up to four seconds.” Professor Eccles, director of the Common Cold Centre at Cardiff University, said years of research had gone into sneezing. He told the court: 'Researchers found that prolonged sneezing is accompanied by a loss of vision and an involuntary closure of the eyes which may be hazardous when driving. 'A sneeze during a critical moment of a journey could have serious consequences.' Professor Eccles said a sneeze could be triggered by a jet of air coming from a car’s air conditioning system. Retired RAF Flight Sergeant David Marshall, 79, (right) was killed outright in the crash. His wife, Mary, 73, (left) died four days later . Career soldier Gurung was driving back to his barracks in Brecon, Powys, after an all-day Army event when he suffered the sneezing fit. Gurung told police: 'I put my right indicator on and as I overtook I began sneezing in rapid succession. 'I was trying to keep my eyes on the road - I was trying all I could to control my vehicle. 'That was the last memory I have, it all happened so quickly.' Retired RAF Flight Sergeant Mr Marshall, 79, was killed outright in the crash. His wife, Mary, 73, died four days later. The pair were driving back from a church barbecue when the accident happened on the A40 near Abergavenny, South Wales, . Newport Crown Court (pictured) heard analysis of the onboard computer of Gurung's VW Golf showed he was travelling at a speed of between 69-78mph - with an average of 74mph . Newport Crown Court heard Gurung, of Brecon, is one of the most decorated Gurkhas ever to have served with the British Army. He saw action in Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan where he won bravery wards and was decorated by the US Government. His commanding officer Major Stuart Lawrence told the court: 'As an individual he is honourable, loyal and completely at the top of his game. I have complete trust in him.' Gurung, who is no longer in the Army and has a civilian job for the Ministry of Defence, is chairman of the Wales Nepalese Society. He denied two charges of causing death by dangerous driving and two alternative charges of causing death by careless driving. He was found not guilty by the jury at Newport Crown Court . Judge Daniel Williams said: 'There are no more difficult cases than this type. 'I extend my condolences to the friends and family of Mr and Mrs Marshall.' The court heard analysis of the onboard computer of Gurung’s VW Golf showed he was travelling at a speed of between 69-78mph - with an average of 74mph. The Gurkha had driven to an Army event in Swindon at 6.15am and was on his way back to his base in Brecon, Powys, when he claims he was hit by the sneezing fit at 9.25pm.","Sergeant Major Harry Gurung had sneezing fit while overtaking, court hears .

"By . Sally Lee . A NSW father who allegedly gave his 12-year-old daughter sex advice and arranged an illegal marriage between her and a 26-year-old man has been granted bail. The 61-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has been charged with procuring a child under 14 for unlawful sexual activities and being an accessory before the fact to sexual intercourse with a person under 14. Police said the young girl's father facilitated the sexual assault of his daughter by actively arranging the unlawful marriage in NSW in January 2014 by allowing the pair to swap phone numbers and meet three times in the family home before an Islamic ceremony took place in the living room. A 26-year-old, pictured, faced Burwood Local Court in May after illegally marrying a girl who was 12-years-old at the time of marriage in January . The couple spent their wedding night at a motel in the Hunter region where they had sex several times, police said. The father allegedly organised his daughter's marriage to the Lebanese immigrant because he wanted to stop her from 'committing a life of sin'. The 26-year-old Lebanese man, who has had his student visa cancelled and been placed in immigration detention, has already been charged with 25 counts of sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 14 years. Court documents say the Hunter Valley girl met the 26-year-old University of Newcastle student in November 2013 after he approached her father and expressed a wish to meet her. The Lebanese man has been charged with 25 counts of sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 14 years . A week after the wedding the father allegedly asked the girl's older siblings to put two single mattresses next to each other to make a queen size bed so the couple had a bed in the family home, the court heard in May. He also asked the girl, now aged 13, if she needed to shower before morning prayer on one occasion, documents show. It also states that since the marriage the pair have engaged in sexual activities on a daily basis. The father is due to reappear at Burwood Local Court on July 21.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Sunseekers enjoying the great outdoors this weekend were shocked to see the clear blue skies obscured - by clumps of falling hay. Clusters of dry grass were reported raining down on several parts of the UK as Britain basked in warm sunshine over the past few days. Homes in Gloucestershire, Devon, Wiltshire, Wales and Lancashire were hit, leaving many with a thick layer of hay to sweep from their cars, lawns and gardens. From above: Clumps of hay falling down from the skies were seen in locations like Devizes, Wiltshire, pictured . Swirling: Experts at the Met Office said that thermal air currents were behind the odd phenomenon . The bizarre sight was filmed by Nick Madigan, 42, who was covered when he got off the bus near his home in Cheltenham on Saturday afternoon. Nick, a self-employed bathroom fitter, said: 'I looked up and I could see all this hay. 'There was no wind, so I assume it was something to do with thermals. 'It was swirling around anti-clockwise and it was quite high in the sky, about the height seagulls fly at. 'The hay must have been picked up from a nearby field and then come down. 'I used to live in Spain and you have what they call ""dust devils"" there, but I have never seen anything like this.' Hot and dry: The weather, combined with large numbers of people cutting hay and mowing lawns, allowed dry hay and grass to travel over the country in air currents. Pictured is Nick Madigan near his home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire . Chris Grew, 59, had his outdoor Sunday lunch interupted when huge lumps of hay fell on him and his wife Claire, 47, and daughter Eleanor, 16, near Devizes, Wiltshire. The electrical engineer said: 'It was quite an amazing event. 'I was even more surprised when I came into the office today to hear from colleagues that it only happened in half of the village - there seems to have been a cut-off point half way. 'It really was quite a peculiar thing to see. We were sitting having lunch in the garden when at first we say just a few little bits coming down. 'Soon it was huge great lumps coming down, covering the garden, the cars, and the caravan. It was all over the place.' It seems the dry rain began earlier in the week, with the first report coming from Angeles Wilson who was showered in hay in Paignton, Devon, on Thursday. She said: 'We were having drinks in the Beefeater garden when we saw shaped clumps of hay like material spiralling down from high up in the sky, no wind. 'It’s even more mysterious as it happened in two different parts of UK days apart.' The most northern reports of the phenomenon came from surprised people in Lancashire, who saw lumps of hay soaring through the air on Sunday. Sophie Dee Wright, 20, from Pendle, Lancashire, said she spotted a small tornado before the hay started to rain down. Sophie Garvey from nearby Burnley added: 'I saw grass falling from the sky. It was the weirdest thing I have ever seen. 'At first I thought it was a load of feathers until it got closer. Then I saw it was clumps of hay and grass . 'How the hell can this happen in three different places in the UK within three days? Weird.' Continual: Falling hay was reported in Devon on Thursday, Gloucestershire on Saturday, Lancashire yesterday and then again in Wales on Sunday . 'Swirling': People reported that the grass formed tornado-like formations before falling from the sky in clumps . Ben Humphreys from near Builth Wells in Wales took to Twitter to report the odd weather he experienced on Sunday evening. He wrote: 'Sky was full of it for 10 mins or so falling from a very high altitude.' Weather experts said the bizarre raining hay was down to rising hot air and warm plumes of cloud-free air. First: Some people mentioned the falling grass and hay as early as Thursday in Devon . Met Office spokesman Helen Chivers said: 'We've had a couple of weeks of dry weather across much of the country and that has allowed the ground to dry and warm up, and this weather has been ideal for farmers to cut grass for hay etc. 'This grass has been lifted into the air by some means, possibly by convection - where the ground heats the air above it causing the air to rise and carrying the grass aloft - and it is then carried along by warm thermals. 'A thermal is a warm bubble or plume of cloud-free air that rises from the ground as the ground is heated and cools the higher it gets. 'Thermals are used by birds to climb with little effort and by glider pilots to gain extra lift during a flight. 'Because the air eventually cools the thermal will break down and the grass will fall from the sky.'","Reports of clumps of dry grass falling  began on Thursday in Devon .

"By . Darren Boyle . Locals in Bolton could not believe their eyes when they spotted a bright pink pigeon flying around their street. David Taylor, 58, saw the unusual bird, which has white and pink plumage and a grey head, flying around the street as he ate his breakfast. The regional sales manager, from Breightmet, captured the images of the bird only seconds before it flew away. David Taylor photographed the unusual pink pigeon after it landed on the roof of his Bolton home . He said: 'I saw a pink bird on the roof on the house opposite me and I couldn’t believe my eyes. 'It looked very unusual so I grabbed my camera because I didn’t think anyone would believe me if I told them what I’d seen. 'I went back to get a picture but it had gone so I thought I’d missed my chance. 'Thankfully it re-appeared about 15 minutes later so I got the pictures quickly then it flew away. 'I’ve never heard of a pink pigeon before so who knows where its from.' Gemma Pidluski, 27, posted images of the unusual bird on her Facebook account after it landed in her back garden. Mr Taylor said he had to take a photograph of the unusual bird, with pink and white plumage and grey head because no-one would believe him otherwise . She said: 'I have just been sitting at home and a pink pigeon has landed on my shed roof. Is it real? 'I have googled it and sure enough there are pink pigeons. 'Bit of nice news for a change.'Another resident, Jackie Fish, thought the bird had been painted in tribute to the England World Cup squad after spotting it only minutes before they took to the field against Uruguay.Jackie, 57, said: “I just saw it there and realised it had been painted white and red, to look like the England flag. 'I have to say as supporting England goes, this is a bit too much and I would class it as cruelty and a bit beyond a joke if that was the case.' There is a known breed of pink pigeon, called nesoenas mayeri, which are native to Mauritius, but they are incredibly rare and are almost completely white. But the cause of the pigeon’s pink hue is not known, however, a diet of high levels of beta carotene and canthaxanthin which are harmless natural food pigments.","Resident David Taylor spotted the multi-coloured bird flying around his road .

"By . Darren Boyle . Over-the-counter divorces will make ending a marriage as easy as 'disposing of a carrier bag', a former government minister has warned. Ann Widdecombe said plans under consideration by the most senior family law judge in England and Wales, Sir James Munby will make obtaining a divorce even easier than it is at present. This comes as the Office of National Statistics has revealed that the number of couples divorcing has increased by 0.5 percent between 2011 and 2012. Ann Widdicombe, left, believes plans under consideration by Sir James Munby, right would be 'making an nonsense of marriage' and 'should not be like buying sweets over the counter, or discarding an old carrier bag' Couples have to be married for at least a year before they can apply for a divorce in England and Wales. A so-called 'quickie divorce' can be granted in England and Wales within six months in the case of adultery or unreasonable behaviour. However, if there are complicated financial issues or a dispute over child care arrangements, the process can take several years. In all cases, one party has to apply to court for a decree nisi citing one of five grounds for the divorce. Once the decree nisi is granted under one of the five grounds, a decree absolute, ending the marriage officially can be issued after six weeks. Ms Widdecombe told The Times: 'Divorce is already too easy — it makes a . nonsense of marriage. I am not saying, go back to the old days when . divorce involved tricks and stratagems, but at least it should be . something people have to think about and take a great deal of trouble . over. 'It should not be like buying sweets over the counter, or discarding an old carrier bag.' The number of divorces has fallen from a high of 153,000 in 2003, although this could be due to a reduction in the number of people getting married. At the outbreak of the Second World War, 450,000 people a year were getting married compared with 250,000 in 2012. In England and Wales, married couples can apply for a divorce if they have been married for at least twelve months and accept that the relationship has permanently broken down. The marriage has to be legally recognised in the UK and the couple must have a permanent home in England and Wales. At present, a divorce petition has to be filed with the court showing the reason for the marriage to end. If . the spouse agrees to the petition, the court will grant a decree nisi, . showing there is no reason why a divorce cannot be granted. Six weeks later, the marriage can be ended with the granting of a decree absolute. According . to the Office of National Statistics, 13 divorces an hour were granted . in 2012 with almost half of these happening within the first decade of . marriage. Women were granted 65 per cent of all divorces and only one in seven was due to adultery. Almost . half of those divorcing had at least one child aged under 16 living . with the family while the most likely time for a split is between the . fourth and eighth wedding anniversary. According to current figures, 42 per cent of all marriages will end in divorce. From 2015, the ONS will also release figures on the first same-sex divorces. More than 40 per cent of all marriages will end in divorce with couples between four and eight years married at the greatest risk . However, Sir James wants to streamline the process, removing uncontested divorces from the court system. He said: ‘There are countries where the system is that a divorce . which is by consent and where there are no children is treated as an . administrative matter dealt with by what, using our terminology, one . might describe as the registrar of births, deaths, marriages and . divorces. It seems to work.’ He said he ‘would not contemplate it . in cases other than cases where there is consent and cases where there . are no children of the family’. Sir James added: ‘All one is doing is actually bringing a . bit of intellectual honesty to the situation and getting rid of an . unnecessary process which simply makes life more complicated.’ Any changes to divorce law would need . parliamentary  legislation to be drawn up and pushed through by the . Justice Secretary. Ministers have  indicated that present Justice . Secretary Chris Grayling will not consider divorce reform before the . election. Andrew Leah, partner at Birchall Blackburn Law said: 'Sir James has stirred up debate in the media by advocating the introduction of new “no-fault” divorces which wouldn’t be dealt with by the courts, but rather by Registrars as an administrative exercise similar to the registration of births,  marriages and deaths. 'Unusually perhaps for a member of the legal profession, I would cautiously welcome Sir James’ suggested reforms for people who want to divorce by mutual consent.  By taking uncontested divorces out of the court system, it could be a faster and cheaper way to bring marriages to an end and may avoid some of the acrimony that sometimes results from court proceedings. 'Sir James’ suggestions do not appear to propose changes to the current rules which provide for compulsory mediation in divorces involving financial or child related issues.   In those circumstances, for people without the benefit of the right legal advice, there is a danger that the dominant partner in the marriage could try to manipulate the mediation process to their own advantage.' The Office of National Statistics will release the first figures on same-sex divorces from 2015 .","Family Law judge supremo wants to remove no-contest divorce form court .

"By . David Kent . Harry Redknapp's comments on players asking to be excused from international duty were 'mischievous' and an unwanted 'grenade', according to Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Gordon Taylor. Redknapap's claim that English players asked him to pull them out of national games while he was Tottenham manager have added to the blame games being played in the wake of the Three Lions' World Cup exit. Captain Steven Gerrard has told Redknapp to name the culprits, but the 67-year-old has refused.For Taylor, the issue is one England do not need as the pieces of their loss to Uruguay are picked up and he feels Redknapp's comments could have been avoided. Mischievous: Harry Redknapp has claimed Spurs players asked to be pulled out of international duty . 'I know Harry, I admire Harry, and I don't know in what context he's said it, I'm perfectly happy to talk to him about it, he's a football man and it may have come from one particular player for some special reason,' he told Sky Sports News. 'It's a little bit mischievous to throw out grenades like that at the end of a World Cup disappointment. I think we all have to get focused and move on.' Taylor insists he does not know of any players to have asked not to be picked for duty and believes omissions are often the fault of club managers. 'I don't know of any youngsters who have done that. I do know at times there is pressure from managers for players not to go because they've got big games,"" he added. 'They were saying that players were injured - this came from the manager not the player - and this is one of the reasons they (players) have to turn up for England and be examined by the doctor because I can tell you, far from it being the players, there have been more players pulled out of England by managers rather than by the players themselves.' No! FA chief Gordon Taylor says that club managers can put pressure on players to miss international games . Grenade: Taylor insists Redknapp's comments are not helpful during disappointment of England's exit . And Taylor reckons playing for their country still matters to players. 'I don't think it helps to stir up such things at this time now when everybody is disappointed that we are no longer at the World Cup party,' he said. 'I think that we should be focusing on getting a team out there and salvaging some pride against Costa Rica. But it's what makes the world go round. I do feel it's unfortunate but I think most people in the game or any player in the game would say any chance to play for England, they'd carry their bags around the world. 'It's a manager knowing his players and I would say with Roy Hodgson, in fact virtually every manager I know, they know who'll go through brick walls for them and who won't.'","Harry Redknapp claims Spurs players asked to be pulled out of England duty .

Costa Rica caused one of the shocks of the first round of games with a 3-1 win over Uruguay and Oscar Duarte scored the key goal in the game. Holland's 5-1 win over reigning champions Spain was one of the results of the round, but there is no place in the XI for either Robin van Persie or Arjen Robben despite both scoring twice in the game.

"By . Damien Gayle . As England's last hopes of World Cup glory were dashed by the audacious talent of Uruguay's Luis Suarez on Thursday, his boss at Liverpool appeared to have no interest in the tournament. Brendan Rodgers was with Liverpool FC's former travel manager Charlotte Hind, 31 exploring the sights of New York's Central Park before visiting the city's famous Museum of Natural History. Hours before the England's crunch match against Uruguay was due to start, Mr Rodgers and Miss Hind were pictured strolling arm-in-arm through the plaza outside the museum. Liverpool boss Brendan Rogers is seen arm-in-arm with Charlotte Hind, Liverpool's former travel coordinator to New York's Museum of Natural History on the day of England's match with Uruguay . As the pair wandered hands-clasped through the courtyard outside the museum, Ms Hind's young daughter was nowhere to be seen. It was a different story three weeks earlier when, on another getaway, this time to a village in Spain, Mr Rodgers was pictured carrying the girl as they went shopping on a sun-kissed afternoon. The Reds manager, 41, was also pictured lifting the little girl out of the child seat of a shopping trolley. Ms Hind is currently divorcing her husband of five years, but Mr Rodgers has denied that they are having a romantic relationship. Meanwhile, his mind may be on the fate of superstar striker Suarez, after La Liga superclubs Real Madrid and Barcelona were said to reaching down the back of their respective sofas to gather the pennies for a mammoth £100million dollar bid for the England slayer. Suarez left England stunned on Thursday night when he put himself on the end of one perfect pass and another fluke deflection to bury the Three Lions' World Cup chances for yet another four years. So when the post-World Cup transfer window opens, Mr Rodgers will have to be ready to kiss Liverpool's talisman goodbye. Mr Rodgers gawps at the museum's stunning architecture as he walks hand-in-hand with Ms Hind . Since taking over as Liverpool manager, Mr Rodgers has undergone an image makeover to match the glamour of one of the top jobs in football. He has apparently had his teeth whitened and lost a noticeable amount of weight, as well as moving from the family home into a £1.2million flat. The father-of-two has spent thousands of pounds on having his teeth whitened and lost weight after regularly exercising at the club's Melwood training ground. Mr Rodgers has also moved out of the house he shared with wife Susan, according to The Sun's Guy Patrick, and bought a luxury flat in an upmarket suburb of the city for £1.2million. Tell me a secret: Mr Rodgers leans in to Ms Hind as they chat over frappe lattes in the centre of New York City . Super star: Liverpool striker Luis Suarez celebrates after scoring a second goal during a Group D football match between Uruguay and England at the Corinthians Arena in Sao Paulo on Thursday night . Last month Mr Rodgers was at Ms Hind's home when a man battered the front door with a cricket bat. He was at the Birkdale, Southport, home of Ms Hind when the man pulled up in his car and began honking his horn and hurling abuse. Mr Rodgers told the man, believed to be in his early 20s, to leave, but he instead started swearing and shouting for Mr Rodgers to come into the street, before grabbing the bat from his car and attacking the front door. He then jumped back in his car and left. Neighbours called the police and three squad cars arrived, but the man was gone. A neighbour told the Mirror: 'He pulled up outside and he was blowing on the horn. 'Then he got out, went to the boot and got a cricket bat out, it looked new, I think it still had the labels on.'","Mr Rodgers was with Charlotte Hind at NYC's Museum of Natural History .

The Arsenal defender, who has been heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford after the World Cup, played just over half an hour of Belgium's victory, before being replaced by Jan Vertonghen.

"By . Oliver Todd . While England have been taking their final game in Brazil seriously enough that they wouldn't allow loyal supporters watch the players train, already-through Costa Rica have been taking a very different approach. Before the tournament this game was seen as one that England would waltz through to hopefully secure qualification but instead they face the conquerors of Italy and Uruguay's and the Group D leaders. And even the Costa Ricans seem to be in disbelief - as shown with their mad antics in training that make Roy Hodgson's team look like a joke.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Why do some people relish the opportunity to solve maths problems, but others get anxious at the mere mention of numbers and letters? The answer could be genetic, according to researchers. A study from Ohio State University found that genes can cause a greater 'maths anxiety' in children who were already struggling in the subject. The cause of maths anxiety in children could partially be due to their genes, researchers claim (stock image shown). The study by Ohio State University found a genetic predisposition could exacerbate or reduce the risk of doing poorly in maths, meaning children who were already struggling would do even worse . To examine this theory, researchers examined how twins differ on measures of maths anxiety. It provides a revised view on why some children may develop a fear of maths that makes it more difficult for them to solve problems and succeed in school. In the battle of the sexes, boys have always been thought to perform better in subjects like maths and science. But a review of 308 studies involving more than 1.1 million children has now completely overturned this long-held stereotype. The study, which looked at data from 1914 to 2011, suggests that girls do better in school than boys - and have been doing so for at least 100 years. The research also claims that girls do better at all ages, in all subjects and all over the world. According to the data, compiled by the University of New Brunswick in Canada, girls have been outperforming boys throughout their academic careers, from infant school to secondary school. The differences are the biggest in language and the smallest in maths, but even in these subjects girls get better grades on average, the researchers said. But although a genetic predisposition was important, it only accounted for about 40 per cent of the problem. Much of the rest was explained by the different environments in the school, in the home and in social circles. ‘Genetic factors may exacerbate or reduce the risk of doing poorly at maths,' said the study's principal investigator, Professor Stephen Petrill. ‘If you have these genetic risk factors for maths anxiety and then you have negative experiences in maths classes, it may make learning that much harder. 'It is something we need to account for when we’re considering interventions for those who need help in maths.’ The study included 216 identical twins and 298 same-sex fraternal twins who participated in the Western Reserve Reading and Maths Projects, an ongoing long-term study of twins in Ohio. Children entered the project in kindergarten or first grade, and were assessed during a maximum of eight home visits. This latest study included data from the last two home visits, when the twins were between about nine and 15 years old. All of the twins completed assessments of maths anxiety, general anxiety, maths problem solving and reading comprehension. In the study, over 500 twins completed assessments of maths anxiety and general anxiety, with the results suggesting genes played a significant factor. The researchers point out that maths anxiety is unique (stock image shown), as children do not get the same anxiety from other subjects such as learning to read . The researchers used statistical tools to see how these various measures of anxiety, maths and reading ability were related between fraternal twins and between identical twins. This allowed them to make conclusions about how differences in maths anxiety could be explained by genetic factors, and how much could be explained by differences in the environments the twins encountered elsewhere. Writing in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, Professor Petrill added: ‘It is important to study anxiety as it applies to how well children learn maths. ‘You say the word ""maths"" and some people actually cringe. It is not like learning how to read, in which people don’t normally have any general anxiety unless they have some kind of difficulty. ‘Maths anxiety is related to both the cognitive side and the affective side of general anxiety. ‘This may result in a downward spiraling process in which these genetic risks to anxiety and poor maths performance work with environmental influences to lead to maths anxiety. This may leads to further problems in maths performance, which exacerbates the maths anxiety symptoms. ‘If we can get a better idea of what provokes this anxiety response, we may be able to develop a better intervention for those with math anxiety. ‘Before this study, researchers didn’t have a clear idea of how important the genetic component of math anxiety is in children and how it originates. 'Is it because of a lack of actual math skills, such as problem solving and ability to do calculations, or is it related to a person’s predisposition to anxiety?’","Researchers at Ohio State University say a fear of maths could be genetic .

And now it has inspired the design of a pair of skyscrapers that, if built, will measure 3,280ft (1km) tall. The Phoenix Towers have been designed to be a soaring centre piece for the city of Wuhan - the capital of central China - and could become the world’s tallest pair of skyscrapers as early as 2017. The Chinese phoenix symbol of high virtue and balance has inspired the design of a pair of skyscrapers (illustrated) that if built, will measure 3,280ft (1km) tall. The world's tallest building is currently the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, at 2,722ft (829 metres) The taller of the two towers will measure 3,280ft (1km) if it is built. They are designed to be the centre piece for the city of Wuhan, the capital of central China. 'Planets' orbiting the towers could house themed restaurants an d 'insect hotels' would be protect plants in the building from pests. The design was based on the Chinese phoenix symbol (pictured) and balanced union. One tower will feed the other with renewable power and together they are intended to reduce pollution levels nearby. They include green walls, solar panels, biomass boilers, a thermal chimney and wind turbine, used to drive a giant kaleidoscope. The project is estimated to cost £1.2billion ($2 billion) with an estimated completion date of 2017. The world's tallest building is currently the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, at 2,722ft (829 metres). Once completed, the Chinese skyscrapers would be same height as the Kingdom Tower in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia planned for 2018. As well as their collective incredible height, visitors to the city of Wuhan would also be able to see vast ‘planets’ orbiting the towers, as well as take in the world’s tallest kaleidoscope. The imaginative design was dreamt up by London-based architects Chetwoods for Wuhan’s HuaYan Group. The towers would cover seven hectares of a 47 hectare site, situated on an island in a lake, which is at the end of a  9,842ft (3km) avenue within a dense city layout – a little like a futuristic Eiffel Tower. The city itself is known as the city of a thousand lakes. However, the building of the huge . £1.2billion ($2billion) project depends on approval from the Mayor of Wuhan. If it . goes ahead, the towers could be built within just three years. The towers (illustrated) will be packed with technology if they are built, and are designed to reduce the pollution levels in the city. The smaller of the towers has plant walls, insect hotels and biomass boilers, while the larger one is covered in photovoltaic panels to harvest solar energy. A kaleidoscope could be driven by a wind turbine .

The building of the £1.2billion ($2billion) project (illustrated) depends on approval from the Mayor of Wuhan . ‘In response to the client's wish to develop a new style of architecture that emphasises Chinese identity, the use of a pair of towers reflects the dualist elements of Chinese culture in contrast to a more western monolithic form,’ the architects said. Based on the traditional Chinese phoenix symbol of two birds, male Feng and Huang, the plan was generated from the yin and yang form to represent perfectly balanced union. The Feng tower uses cutting-edge technology to 'feed' the Huang tower with renewable power in a symbiotic process. Among the technological features planned for the structure are ways to recycle and clean water and air, in a bid to reduce local pollution levels. In the design, there are three large spheres suspended between the two skyscrapers, which represent 'planets' orbiting the towers. These are set to house restaurants that will have a celestial theme and are accessed via 'skywalks' from the towers themselves. The main tower would accommodate the world's tallest kaleidoscope, driven by a wind turbine at a high level to create a colourful display when viewed from below. Chetwoods said the project would showcase social, economic and environmental sustainability in China if it gets the go-ahead.

"Kyle Keen was 16 months old when he suffered severe brain haemorrhaging after being shaken by Tyrone Matthews . A baby who was shaken to death by his violent stepfather could still be alive today if it wasn't for a host of 'catastrophic mistakes' at a hospital, an independent report has found. Kyle Keen was 16 months old when he suffered severe brain haemorrhaging after being shaken by Tyrone Matthews. The 32-year-old from Walsall was jailed for six-and-a-half year in December 2007 after he pleaded guilty to manslaughter at Wolverhampton Crown Court. The baby's mother Kerry McIntosh, then aged 21, also from Walsall, admitted cruelty by neglect and was given a six-month suspended prison term. But an independent report ruled that there was a 'significant probability' the little boy would not have died if an intervention had taken place. Now Kyle's biological father Robert, 31, has . said he hoped lessons had been learned as his son would 'probably still . be alive' if cared for properly by health professionals. Just a week before his death, the report said that staff at Walsall Manor Hospital noticed bruising on Kyle's arms a week before his death but failed to act. Junior doctors and nurses who examined the toddler also believed he was being abused but a consultant paediatrician stopped them from alerting police and social workers, it said. The report listed a catalogue of errors by medics who treated him leading up to his death on June 30, 2006. They included 'serious errors of judgement' that may have led directly to further injury to Kyle after his admission on June 21. It also found that the staff who raised concerns should have pursued those further, even though a senior colleague disagreed, that record keeping at the time was poor, inadequate and contained numerous omissions, and that the trust did not take 'appropriate action' at the time to investigate thoroughly. Tyrone Matthews was jailed for six-and-a-half years in December 2007 after he pleaded guilty to manslaughter at Wolverhampton Crown Court. The baby's mother Kerry McIntosh, then aged 21, admitted cruelty by neglect and was given a six-month suspended prison term . The little died following his transfer from Walsall to the paediatric intensive care unit in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, when a bleed on the brain was diagnosed. He had been admitted a few days previously on June 21, 2006, where bruises were noted but no follow-up action was taken and he was discharged. He was then admitted to the hospital again on June 29 with a brain injury and died a day later. Dr David Drew was the head of the paediatric department at Manor Hospital at the time. He later acted as a whistleblower in the case and said he had tried to raise concerns over his death and a member of staff in the department. Yesterday he said a number of medical staff had told a consultant who had seen Kyle that the case needed to be referred to social services. But an independent report ruled that there was a 'significant probability' the little boy would not have died if an intervention had taken place. Now  Kyle's biological father Robert, 31, has said he hoped lessons had been learned as his son would 'probably still be alive' if cared for properly by health professionals . He said: 'From day one it was quite clear an opportunity had been missed the previous week and this little boy had suspicious, unexplained bruising. 'I have no doubt that if Kyle had been referred to social services he would have survived.' Mr Keen said he hoped the hospital had learned lessons. He said: 'In 2012 I learned from a senior doctor who had helped look after Kyle in his final hours that he died following 'catastrophic mistakes' in basic safeguarding at Manor Hospital. 'The hospital did not tell me anything about this. 'I have learned from the report that if the hospital had cared for Kyle properly he would probably still be alive. 'I understand from the report that Kyle was sent home where he met his death by a doctor against the advice of medical and nursing colleagues and against the child protection policy. 'It is impossible for me to say how this makes me feel. It is all made worse by the fact that this has been kept from us for eight long years. 'He should have been referred to social services. This would probably have saved his life. 'The report is also clear that Kyle's death was not investigated properly at the time or subsequently. 'It is good to learn the truth at last. But the report leaves many questions in my mind unanswered. Just a week before his death, the report said that staff at Walsall Manor Hospital noticed bruising on Kyle's arms a week before his death but failed to act. Junior doctors and nurses who examined the toddler also believed he was being abused but a consultant paediatrician stopped them from alerting police and social workers, it said . 'The review has been unable to find out why I was not involved in the investigations into Kyle's death. 'Nor why neither the hospital nor safeguarding board contacted me to tell me of their findings. 'I hope that Manor Hospital will learn the lessons from this latest investigation and that no other family will lose a child because of such serious mistakes. 'But if that does happen I hope the hospital will immediately put its hands up and admit it got it wrong. 'Covering things up for years only makes things worse.' Mr Keen made a formal complaint about the inadequate care the youngster received and chief executive Richard Kirby agreed to commission the review, which was carried out by consultants Cordis Bright. The hospital have now apologised and insisted improvements have been made, including how it works with other agencies. Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust said there were now new processes for ensuring that the information for a child is available in the medical records in the event of the same youngster being admitted. Richard Kirby, the trust's chief executive said: 'We recognise that an apology alone is not sufficient and I hope that we have been able to demonstrate to Mr Keen our commitment to act on what we have learnt from this review.'","Kyle Keen was was killed by stepfather Tyrone Matthews, 32, in 2006 .

"By . Aap . A Supreme Court jury has toured the former home of accused killer Gerard Baden-Clay and the site where his wife's body was found. Jurors spent almost an hour at the Kholo Creek Bridge at Anstead in Brisbane's west on Monday morning. The body of 43-year-old Allison Baden-Clay was found on the creek bank, below the bridge on April 30, 2012, 10 days after her husband reported her missing. Scroll down for video . Allison and Gerard Baden-Clay pictured in an undated photograph, were working together at his real estate agency before she died . Police blocked traffic from entering the two-lane bridge as jurors peered over the side to see the area where a kayaker spotted Mrs Baden-Clay's remains more than two years ago. To get on to the bridge they had to pass a stone memorial for Mrs Baden-Clay where people had placed pots of yellow flowers, to match the mother-of-three's favourite colour. The jury was accompanied by presiding judge Justice John Byrne and lawyers for the defence and prosecution, as well as court staff. They then travelled by minibus to the Baden-Clay's former house at nearby Brookfield, where according to the Crown case, something happened to Mrs Baden-Clay on April 19, 2012. Then: The Baden-Clay's house as it was in 2012 when she went missing . Now: The judge and jury visit the Baden-Clay's former home in Brookfield in Brisbane's west . They spent about 25 minutes touring the former residence, a Queenslander set back from the busy road that is now part of the childcare centre next door. A faded plastic bunch of yellow flowers and a plastic wreath hanging on the front fence were the only signs the house once belonged to the Baden-Clays. The fading blue paintwork has been replaced with fresh cream and brown colours and the trees and shrubs that once hid the house from the road have mostly been cleared. The jury was then driven past the homes of neighbours who testified to hearing noises coming from the Baden-Clay's home on the night of April 19, 2012. Baden-Clay, a real estate agent, has pleaded not guilty to murder. More than 50 witnesses have testified during his trial, which has entered its third week. The jury will return to court on Tuesday for more witness evidence. The jury are taken to Kholo Creek, where Allison Baden-Clay's body was found .

Ivan Lendl was back home in Connecticut with a tee time booked but, had he been sitting in his usual coach’s seat, he would have quietly purred his approval at Andy Murray’s return to Centre Court. Fifty weeks have passed since the grand old arena was last open for business but, in these vastly different circumstances, we got a similar level of sangfroid from the great home hope as he exhibited on that heady afternoon last July.

As on that day, the court looked . totally different to the one which greeted  Murray when he faced Novak . Djokovic in the final. The . virgin surface was a thing of verdant beauty, which can bring challenges . all of its own to those not used to it. Goffin is a nimble mover, but . it was notable how the much heavier Murray was so much more footsure.

This . contributed to him spraying his groundstrokes all over the place in the . first set, and Murray was a grateful recipient as he was clearly under . strain.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . In 2011 an alarming study by Standford University suggested Great White Sharks were becoming an endangered species. But new look at research on them in the Eastern North Pacific Ocean indicates the population is now growing thanks to conservation efforts, according to an international research team. And the lead author of the study says the 2011 study underestimated the number of Great White Sharks in the oceans - and it should not be regarded as an endangered species. A new look at research on Great White Sharks in the Eastern North Pacific Ocean indicates the population is likely growing rather than endangered. A Great White Shark is pictured in the Eastern North Pacific in this undated handout photograph courtesy of Kevin Weng, University of Hawaii . George Burgess, director of the Florida Program for Shark Research who led the new study published in the journal Plos One, said the wide-ranging study is good news for shark conservation. White sharks can be notoriously difficult to count. They are highly mobile and migratory and group themselves by age, sex and size. Unlike marine mammals, they do not surface to breathe. Some gather at aggregation sites to dine on seals while others stay at sea, dining on fish. Most tagging studies use photographic tags - pictures of unique markings, such as nicks on fins or scars - and those markings can change over time. Population estimates, however, are important to conservation. Sharks are sensitive to overfishing, both as unintentional catches for fisherman seeking other fish and as targets for sport or in areas where shark meat is a delicacy. White sharks are protected in many areas internationally, including the west coast of the United States, but because they swim in and out of jurisdictions they are still vulnerable, and the older study raised concerns. Scientists reanalysed three-year-old research that indicated white shark numbers in the Eastern North Pacific were alarmingly low, with only 219 counted at two sites. That study triggered petitions to list white sharks as endangered. 'The good news is that white sharks are returning to levels of abundance,' said Burgess, also a co-founder of the Shark Specialist Group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. 'White sharks are the largest and most charismatic of the predator sharks, and the poster child for sharks and the oceans in general. 'If something is wrong with the largest, most powerful group in the sea, then something is wrong with the sea, so it's a relief to find they're in good shape.' Great White Sharks are now listed as 'vulnerable' on the IUCN Red List rather than 'endangered'. Burgess credits the growth in sharks to 40 years of U.S. federal protections for marine mammals that sharks feed on, especially sea lions and seals. In addition, white sharks have been protected as a prohibited species, making it illegal to bring a great white to dock. Burgess said he and some other shark experts 'did a double take' when the Stanford researchers calculated the population of adult and near-adult great whites along the central California coast at 219. The Burgess study claims that the Stanford researchers then claimed inappropriately the 219 count represented half of the adult and near-adult population in the entire Eastern North Pacific, which runs from Alaska down to Central America. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) was petitioned to add white sharks to the endangered species list but declined, based on its own research, bolstered by a preview copy of the study by the international team, said Heidi Dewar, a fisheries research biologist. NMFS estimated the Eastern North Pacific population at about 3,000 sharks. 'We determined there were enough animals that there was a low to very low risk of extinction, and in fact, most developments suggest an increasing population,' Dewar said. Great White Sharks can be notoriously difficult to track because they are highly mobile and migratory, being found in oceans throughout the world as shown in this distribution map. They also group themselves by age, sex and size, making them difficult to count accurately . In this study scientists re-analysed three-year-old research that indicated white shark numbers in the Eastern North Pacific were alarmingly low, with only 219 counted at two sites. They found that the total population is most likely at least an order of magnitude higher at well over 2,000 . Burgess and his colleagues assembled a 10-member team with expertise in all facets of shark biology: demography, population dynamics, life history, tagging and movements, fishery biology and conservation, and mathematical modeling. The team has studied sharks from Florida to California, Alaska to Hawaii and around the globe. For their reanalysis, the international team examined the two aggregation sites where the earlier count was obtained, the Farallon Islands and Tomales Point, which attract seals and the sharks that feed on them. They found that the sub-populations at both sites were so fluid, with both resident and transient sharks, that it would not be possible to extrapolate a total population number. To get a better picture of the white shark population in the Eastern North Pacific, the team decided to examine several other known aggregation sites, from Mexico into British Columbia and Alaska. The team also conducted a demographic analysis to account for all life stages for the sharks at Farallon Islands and Tomales Point and found that the total population is most likely at least an order of magnitude higher - rather than just over 200 sharks there likely were well over 2,000. For their reanalysis the team examined the two aggregation sites where the earlier count was obtained, the Farallon Islands and Tomales Point (shown). They found that the sub-populations at both sites were so fluid that it would not be possible to extrapolate a total population number, so they examined other known sites . There has been much controversy regarding the accidental catching of sharks, known as 'bycatch'. IT is now illegal to bring white sharks to dock and measures to try and improve shark numbers are seemingly working. Pictured is a Great White Shark caught by fisherman in a boat close to Bodega Bay in California in March 2011 . 'The listing of a species as ""endangered"" places substantial demands on governments,' Burgess continued. 'Listing species that are not under the threat of biological extinction diverts resources away from species genuinely at risk. 'We want to use our resources for the neediest species.' The earlier study also compared shark population numbers with other so-called apex predators (those at the top of their food chain), such as polar bears and killer whales. That study, however, ignored the differences in the community structures for those three species and the fact that polar bears and whales, as mammals, are easier to count. 'That we found these sharks are doing OK, better than OK, is a real positive in light of the fact that other shark populations are not necessarily doing as well,' said Burgess. 'We hope others can take our results and use them as a positive starting point for additional investigation.' And he added: 'This is a real pleasure for us in the biology business to be talking about because it's a success story.'","A team of scientists led by the University of Florida studied shark numbers .

'Earlier this morning, we experienced an issue that prevented people . from posting to Facebook for a brief period of time,' a Facebook spokesperson said. 'We resolved the issue quickly, and we are now back to 100 per cent. We're sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused.' Scroll down for video . Facebook experienced an outage this morning that meant users around the globe were unable to log on to the world's largest social network for 30 minutes - and the error may have cost the California-based company as much as £300,000 ($500,000) While down the social network showed an error message on its home screen as users struggled to log on. ‘Sorry, something went wrong’ the message replacing Facebook's home page stated. ‘We’re working on getting this fixed as soon as we can.’ At the time users flocked to Twitter to vent their frustration at the lack of service. '@facebook is still down! This is the longest I remember,' said one. 'facebook is down! I don't think I've ever seen that before,' said another. Website downdetector.com said there were over 6,000 reports from users of Facebook being down during the outage. 78 per cent reported a total blackout, while 21 per cent were unable to log in. Website downdetector.com showed a map of where Facebook outages were being reported around the globe. The most reports were in Europe, where many users were awake and trying to access the website, while in the U.S. there were less reports as it was the middle of the night for most there . A server status check for Facebook showed that the website was unavailable - but the social network says it is now operating at 100 per cent again after the 30-minute outage left users across the globe without access . This isn't the first time the company has experienced a major outage. In October 2013 the social network was down for four hours, with the site blaming the outage on 'network maintenance.' Facebook prevented people from posting new statuses, writing on walls and making payments. Reports suggest the tech giant makes about £8,800 ($15,000) in revenue every 60 seconds. This would suggest the latest outage lasting just 30 minutes cost the company almost £300,000 ($500,000). Facebook users took to other social networks on 21 October 2013 as well to complain that the site wouldn't let them post a new status.

Amelie Mauresmo made her entrance late, slipping into the last vacant seat on the front row of the Centre Court players’ box after Andy Murray had basked in the warm, appreciative roar of a near-capacity crowd. This was his moment to savour. One the Frenchwoman had told him over dinner on Wednesday night to try and enjoy. After all, you never know when it will happen again. It is only seven years since Mauresmo experienced the same sensation of being introduced as a defending champion at the All England Club. She was 27 then, the same age as Murray now, but her straight-sets win over Jamea Jackson was not accompanied by the same sense of history and emotion as the return of Britain’s first male singles champion for 77 years. Box seat: Amelie Mauresmo returned to Centre Court as Andy Murray's coach . Hero's welcome: Andy Murray is given a standing ovation on his return to defend his Wimbledon title . Been there, done that! Amelie Mauresmo reacts after winning the 2006 Championships . Accordingly, Mauresmo seemed intent on . making sure this was all about ‘the pupil’, as Murray called himself, . and not his teacher, who eventually fell in the fourth round against . Nicole Vaidisova  in 2007. It . helped that this was such a business-like encounter for the British No1 . but, apart from adopting Murray’s Adidas-branded kit instead of the . Nike sportswear she wore as a player, Mauresmo seemed perfectly content . to fade into the background as much as possible. There were plenty of . other women in the Murray camp – girlfriend Kim, mother Judy and grandma . Shirley Erskine in the Royal Box – to share the limelight, too. Murray . said: ‘I have felt pretty calm the last 10 days or so. Whether that’s . to do with Amelie or not, I’m not 100 per cent sure. But I’ve enjoyed . all of the practices. ‘She’s a very calm person, the way she speaks and the way she explains things. It’s been good so far. Calming influence: Andy Murray has noted how relaxed he has been since working with Amelie Mauresmo . Mum's the word: Amelie Mauresmo greets Andy Murray's mother Judy before the opening game . The other woman in his life: Andy Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears was also in attendance at SW19 . ‘One . of the things she said was she tried to take in the atmosphere and the . experience of walking out on the court as the defending champion. You . never know if you’ll get the chance to do it again. ‘She has quite clear memories of doing that herself and so that was one  of the things she told me to try and do.’ Mauresmo’s . calm demeanour will be crucial to the success of her relationship with . Murray. The British No1 likened his younger self to Dennis the Menace . yesterday in discussing his guest editorship of ‘The Beano’, and . Murray’s mother, Judy, has said he wanted a coach ‘who would really . listen’. Mauresmo certainly . played that role yesterday.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . From Google Glass to smartwatches, wearable technology seems to be the next big thing in the world of gadgets. But what if one of the most popular forms of wearable tech, fitness sensors that monitor your health, didn’t need to be wearable at all? Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) claim they’ve designed such a system that measures vital signs through brick walls, and could one day do-away with the smart wristbands. Scroll down for video . Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have revealed a system that can monitor the heart beat and position of people through walls. The precise system measures the rise and fall of a person's chest so, for example, parents could monitor their sleeping baby while they are not in the room (pictured) The research was conducted at MIT’s Wireless Center, hosted in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). The system works by transmitting a low-power wireless signal and using its reflections to track moving humans. It can do so even if the humans are in closed rooms or hiding behind a wall. As the signal is transmitted at a wall, a portion of the signal penetrates through, reflecting off a person on the other side. Using a complex metric, the precise technology then estimates the size of the person. The technology is so accurate it can measure the minute changes in a person’s chest as they breathe, giving a reading for their heart rate with 99 per cent accuracy.

This could, for example, monitor a baby’s breathing and heart rate remotely, or keep an eye on an elderly living at home alone. And the same method could have even more uses, from recognising gestures and controlling ‘smart’ objects in a room, to even detecting emotions.

As the signal is transmitted at a wall, a portion of the signal penetrates through, reflecting off a person on the other side . In the research, tiny antennas placed behind a wall were able to track the position of a person to mere centimetres. Each antenna was about the size of a coin (left) and, in the experiment, they were wired together (right) to monitor people through walls . There are various pieces of wearable technology on the market today with different functions. Fitbit smart wristbands, for example, are used to measure steps, stairs climbed, calories burned and sleep. Some also include a full OLED screen that can supply additional information for users . Earlier . this year Fitbit stopped sales of its £80 ($130) Force fitness . wristband after users discovered it could cause an allergic reaction. In . a letter posted on the company website CEO and co-founder James Park . said about 1.7 percent of users reported skin irritation. Fitbit . said independent test results had not found problems with the Force's . battery or electrical systems, suggesting that users may have had . allergic reactions to nickel in the device or materials used in the . strap or adhesives used to make the Force. The team - . which includes Robert Miller, a professor of electrical engineering and . computer science, and graduate students Fadel Adib and Zach Kabalec - . has also developed the capability to track the movements of up to four . distinct individuals. This . could be helpful for search-and-rescue operations, such as when . emergency responders are trying to find survivors inside a burning . building. ‘It has traditionally been very difficult to capture such minute motions that occur at the rate of mere millimetres per second,’ said MIT professor of electrical engineering computer science Dina Katabi, a co-author for the paper containing the study who also directs the Wireless Center. ‘Being able to do so with a low-cost, accessible technology opens up the possibilities for people to be able to track their vital signs on their own.’ In the past year, a number of such wireless systems have sprung up aside from WiZ including WiTrack, also designed at MIT. This . device can plot movements and even follow gestures, meaning that a person . can switch a light off in a separate room just by raising their arm. Ground breaking: WiTrack can track movements and gestures, such as pointing at a lamp to switch it on, through walls without using cameras or wearable technology . Using radio signals . about 1,000 times less powerful than a smartphone, so-called WiTrack bounces . off objects detected through a wall to pinpoint a person. WiTrack . relies on several antennas to plot movements, and an algorithm is then used to sift through readings . caused by waves hitting household objects such as sofas. The designers behind WiTrack envision it being used for video games and to control household appliances. The technology can even be used to track movements in a room (pictured) through walls. This could be useful to monitor the condition of elderly people who live alone. It could also provide a new way to play video games. Current system's such as Microsoft's Kinect rely on line-of-sight to work, for example . With video games, . players would no longer have to remain in front of the computer, and . could stalk enemies in hallways and launch ambushes from behind the . sofa. It could also . be used to help monitor elderly people who are at risk of falling, . without an individual having to wear an alarm or put cameras inside . their home. While it . will be years before the device is ready for commercial release, it is . already making its mark as being cheaper than other devices and also . does away with the need of cameras and other wearable technology.","Scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology have unveiled a wireless system that can monitor the heart rate of people in another room .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Chile’s peaceful Atacama Desert, surrounded by terracotta mountains and rolling dunes, had its silence abruptly broken last night. A powerful explosion on the peak of the 3,000m-high Cerro Amazones mountain rocked the region at around 2pm local time (7pm BST). Engineers were blasting away a million tonnes of rock to make way for the most powerful telescope ever to be built. Named the European Extremely Large Telescope, or E-ELT, the observatory could aid the search for alien life and unravel the long-held mysteries of the universe. It is due to be completed in 2022 when scientists claim it will be able to take direct images of planets orbiting distant stars. As the name implies, the telescope will be immense. Around 2,500 tonnes of steel rigging is already heading to Chile to hold a mirror nearly 130ft (40m) wide. Dubbed the ‘world’s biggest eye on the sky’, it will capture 15 times more light than any other telescope in existence with images 16 times sharper than those produced by Hubble.

Once the rugged mountain top has been tamed, the £879m ($1.1bn) E-ELT will have ideal conditions for observing deep space . A £1 billion ($1.6 billion) 'time machine', which could reveal mysteries of the universe, is finally complete. The last giant antenna for Alma, the world’s largest land-based observatory, recently arrived in Chile allowing scientists to peer deeper into the cosmos than ever before. It is hoped it will allow astronomers to learn about our origins by peering back to almost the first moments after the universe was formed. The Alma array is situated high on the Chajnantor Plateau, a remote area of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile at 16,400 feet (5,000 metres) above sea level. There, the dryness and altitude create some of the best conditions for observing the night sky. With the latest arrival, the observatory combines the forces of 66 radio antennae, most almost 40 feet (12 metres) in diameter. Combined, they make the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (Alma) accurate enough to see a golf ball nine miles (15 km) away. Astronomers claim E-ELT could provide a key insight into the first galaxies to form after the Big Bang 14 billion years ago. They also hope it will shed light on one of the biggest mysteries of our universe - the formation of 'dark matter', which can’t be seen but is believed to make up most of the mass of the cosmos. ‘The E-ELT will allow astronomers to reach deeper into space, further back in time and more intimately into the workings of the universe than any other visible to infrared telescope ever built’, said Dr Aprajita Verma, Deputy Project Scientist for the UK E-ELT project at Oxford University. ‘From probing the first galaxies that formed in the universe, to studying extra-solar planets and looking for signs of life, we can expect break through advances and new discoveries with the E-ELT.’ Once the rugged mountain top has been tamed, the £879m ($1.1bn) E-ELT will have ideal conditions for observing deep space. Its location means it is far above most of Earth's atmosphere and water vapour, which would otherwise obscure observations. The telescope is the latest project for the European Southern Observatory (ESO). Britain is one of 15 countries involved in the E-ELT and has invested £88 million ($149 million) towards the project. The design for E-ELT followed plans for something known as the Overwhelmingly Large Telescope (Owl) which was hoped to have an aperture of 100 metres - the same distance that Usain Bolt ran in 9.58 seconds.

"By . Charlie Scott . On an individual level there were occasional moments of brilliance from Cristiano Ronaldo during Portugal’s draw with USA - not least his fabulous series of skills in the fourth minute and his perfect assist for Silvestre Varela's late leveller - but collectively his team suffered because of his positioning, or lack of it. In the first half he started on the left of a forward three, but minutes in he was yards away from Nani on the right. His unpredictable movements, perhaps in part to do with the knee injury that has been troubling him this last month, made it difficult for his team-mates to know where to play. VIDEO Scroll down for Fans celebrate thrilling USA v Portugal match at Rio's Fan Fest . Out of sorts: Cristiano Ronaldo looks to the sky during a mixed display for Portugal against USA . VIDEO Ronaldo in sensational form . Maybe he was moving inside to limit the distance of his sprints, or just to try and see more of the ball. There was one passage of play that had fans of both sides on their feet in the opening minutes of the game. After stealing the ball from Alejandro Bedoya on the left he drove forward, chopped inside a challenge from Jermaine Jones, pulled off a Cruyff turn to get away from Fabian Johnson, and then stroked the ball from one foot to the other as Jones came in for a second helping. Somehow, Ronaldo emerged with the ball on the other side, where he teed it off to Joao Moutinho. Magic: Ronaldo spins past the challenge of Jermaine Jones as he bewilders three USA players in one dribble . Other than that dribble his first half was punctuated by overhit passes and hugely ambitious attempts on goal that flew way off target. On more than one occasion it was the pitch that let him down - if his dramatic gestures were anything to go by. Off target: His set pieces were below-par against USA, with a number of free-kicks flying high and wide . His tactical indiscipline left Portugal’s left side wide open, and USA boss Jurgen Klinsmann was clever enough to exploit it. In need of a spark: Ronaldo was isolated at times as his team-mates failed to provide him with chances . Chance after chance was created down USA's right and it was surprising the Americans were not level at the break, after Nani had lifted an effort over Tim Howard to give Portugal an early lead. USA threw players forward after the break and Jermaine Johnson made it 1-1 with a phenomenal swerving effort that Ronaldo would have been proud of. Then, the inevitable happened, Klinsmann's side scored from an attack down their right. Bruno Alves failed to clear the cross and Michael Bradley had a shot saved, before the ball was cannoned back in by Graham Zusi and Clint Dempsey was on hand to deflect it over the line. Goal of the night: Jermaine Jones celebrates after pulling USA level with a wonderful individual goal . Yet, when Paulo Bento's side were chasing a late equaliser, there was Ronaldo. Four-and-a-half minutes into the allotted five of added time, the Real Madrid forward received the ball in space on the right and whipped an inch-perfect cross to the back post for Varela to thump a header home. Saviour: An incredible cross by Ronaldo sets up Varela's equaliser for Portugal that made it 2-2 in Manaus .

The replica of the 1825 Robert Stephenson-designed Locomotion No. 1 is marking 175 years since iron rails were laid on the route in County Durham. Having used wooden rails since 1725, experts said it heralded a new era of transport and mining in the area. Historic: A replica of the first ever passenger train steams along the world's oldest railway today to celebrate an industrial landmark . Steam: It is a fully working replica of Robert Stephenson's Locomotion No. 1, the first ever locomotive train to carry passengers between Darlington and Stockton in 1825 . Coal: It travelled along the world's oldest railway line, Tanfield Railway in County Durham to mark 175 years since iron rails were introduced on the line . Big event: In 1839 iron rails were used for the tracks, which is thought to be one of the earliest-recorded cases of modernisation in transport infrastructure .

Tanfield Railway director David Watchman said: ‘This is perhaps one of the earliest-recorded cases of modernisation in transport infrastructure. ‘The rebuilding with iron rails made possible the introduction of steam to the route and the collieries it served, both in the shape of stationary engines and locomotives.’ Stephenson's Locomotion No. 1 was the first steam locomotive to run on a passenger line. It made its debut on September 27, 1825 on the Stockton and Darlington Railway. The replica steamed into action at Marley Hill, near Gateshead, this morning and will be running tomorrow and next weekend. Mr Watchman added: ‘We know that Marley Hill colliery was the location for some of the first locomotives introduced to the route and that they were very similar to Locomotion.

According to the Tanfield Railway website, when the line was built in 1725 it was 'unlike anything else in its era, or even since the Roman Empire. 'It was a triumph of engineering over nature, a clear signal that a new industrial age was upon the world, and that railways would play a massive part.' The event this weekend come 11 years before the railway celebrates its tricentenary in 2025. The line is now maintained and operated by volunteers. An even older part of the railway called the Lobley Hill section was built around 1647 and had been going for more than 300 years when it shut in 1964.","Replica of 1825 Stephenson-designed Locomotion No. 1 is marking 175 years since iron rails were laid on route .

An aspiring glamour model who had a £5,000 breast enlargement on the NHS is now in line for £2,500 of dentistry work paid for by the taxpayer. Josie Cunningham, 24, who sparked outrage when she had the operation to enhance her bust, is now pregnant after falling into a life of prostitution. All mothers-to-be are entitled to receive free NHS dental care, and Miss Cunningham is reportedly set to make the most of the treatment on offer by having root canal surgery, a dental implant, a filling and her wisdom teeth removed. The unmarried mother-of-two, who revealed last week that she was three-months pregnant and did not know who the father is, said she was pleased the NHS would be footing the bill for her dentistry. 'I didn't get pregnant to have my teeth sorted, but it's a massive bonus,' she told The Sun. 'I'm sure people will be annoyed that I'm accepting this freebie but I couldn't care less.' She said that she was annoyed the free dental care would only cover a silver filling, but added: 'I guess beggars can't be choosers'. Miss Cunningham, from Leeds, said that she was no longer working as an escort, but has admitted that she does not know who the father of her baby is. He could either be a surgeon who paid her £1,000 for a night of passion or a friend she has casual sex with. Miss Cunningham hit the headlines last year when she underwent cosmetic . surgery to increase her bust from 32A to a 36DD at St James’s Hospital . in Leeds. The operation caused outrage, heightened further by the same NHS trust refusing to fund surgery that would enable a two-year-old girl with a form of cerebral palsy to walk. Scroll down for video . Aspiring model: Miss Cunningham hit the headlines last year when she underwent cosmetic surgery to increase her bust from 32A to a 36DD at St James's Hospital in Leeds . Before: Miss Cunningham before her breast enlargement. She says she was bullied about her flat chest from the age of 14 . Daily Mail readers donated thousands of pounds to help fund an operation on Sophie Thomlinson's spinal cord after health chiefs decided that the £25,000 surgery was too expensive. Oliver Dockerty, three, was also refused funding for the pioneering procedure, called selective dorsal rhizotomy. Miss Cunningham has vowed to work to pay back the £4,800 cost of her operation, but has said that the £1,000 she had set aside to reimburse the Health Service has now been spent on clothes for her new baby. Josie has previously flaunted her new breasts and even used this outfit to offer a tribute to the NHS for paying for her implants . Contrast: Sophie Thomlinson, two, was denied a life changing operation at Leeds General Infirmary and Oliver Dockerty, three, was also refused funding for the pioneering procedure . Last week she told how she had turned to escort work at the suggestion of a friend and had slept with her fourth client, an unmarried surgeon in his mid-30s, charging him £450 for dinner and £1,000 for a night of sex. ‘I’m ashamed to say I don’t know who the father is,’ Miss Cunningham told Closer . magazine. ‘I’ve only slept with one client, but I’ve also been having . casual sex with a friend.’ She was still seeing two clients a week until discovering that she was expecting a baby, and has since worked on adult phone lines. New start: Miss Cunningham said that she was no longer involved with prostitution, but has admitted that she does not know who the father of her baby is . Miss Cunningham has a congenital medical condition which means she has no breast tissue. She says she was bullied about her flat chest from the age of 14. Recently she decided she wants her breast implants removed - again paid for by the NHS.","Josie Cunningham, 24, had a £5,000 breast enlargement on the NHS .

"By . Dan Bloom . From a battered metallic 'electric egg' to an angular rocket, these are how the world's top designers once thought the cars of the future would look. An exhibition has brought together 19 concept cars over the ages, and while some may resemble what we have today, others are out of this world. With names like Cyclone and Thunderbolt, the designs were almost never destined for sale. Instead they were a way for fiercely competitive car firms to flex their muscle and put a stamp on history. Electric Egg: French artist Paul Arzen built his three-wheeled L'OEuf électrique in 1942 to help him get around the streets of Paris during the war, and in many ways it was a precursor to the Smart cars of today . People-carrier: Fewer than 10 1936 Stout Scarabs were hand-produced by the U.S. Stout Motor Car Company, which wanted 'a virtual living room on wheels'. It was based on the scarab beetle and could seat seven . Made to order: Edsel Ford commissioned the Model 40 Special Speedster himself in 1934 because he wanted a sleek car like those he had seen in Europe. Many features were considered radical but appeared in later Fords . Sleek: French aeronautical pioneer Gabriel Voisin unveiled his C-25 Aérodyne at a 1934 show in Paris as a statement of modernist luxury. He had to adopt new techniques as the French car industry declined after 1929 . And they introduced revolutionary ideas which would go into mainstream production decades later, such as heated seats, proximity sensors and rear view cameras. The concept cars have been collected from across Europe and the U.S. for a new exhibition at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia. They were all built as fully-functioning cars - but many have not been driven for several years. Included in the exhibit are the 1942 L'Oeuf électrique (Electric Egg), created by French engineer Paul Arzens for his personal use in the streets of Paris during the Second World War. And the designs resurged after the war ended, with General Motors producing the rocket-shaped Firebird XP-21 in 1953 which had hints of the space race that was to come. Taking influence from a real jet, the car even ran on a gas turbine - which proved far too expensive to enter commercial production. Legend: Bugatti now make some of the world's fastest cars, and the Aerolithe was made by Jean Bugatti himself in 1935. Its rounded look was a departure from the boxy style of the day. Pictured is a 2007 recreation . Speedy: Only five 1941 Chrysler Thunderbolts were built but they were touted as 'The Car of the Future,' built to educate the public about aerodynamics and streamlining. They foretold many later designs in the 1950s . Chunky: The 1948 Tasco (The American Sports Car Company) included mobile fiberglass front fenders which turned with the wheels. The T-top roof design with removable panels influenced the 1968 Corvette . Pet project: American engineer Norman Timbs created the 1947 Special for his personal use. It was touted as a 'little workbench project' but took Timbs more than two and a half years to build and cost him $10,000 . Experimental and concept cars surged in popularity in the 1930s, after the automobile turned from . simply a modern mode of transport into a statement of style and . independence. They became known as 'dream cars' in the 1950s, and allowed engineers the freedom to invent new technology which would find a practical outlet in cars produced decades later. Hundreds were produced by designers as diverse as European artists and American car giants. The designs in the exhibition, which date from 1932 to the present day, chronicle battles to conquer fashion trends which either seem outdated, have since resurged or both. One such contest was for the 'ultimate wedge', won in the minds of some by Italian firm Carrozzeria Bertone's Stratos HF Zero in 1970 - rising just 33 inches off the road. Bizarrely enough, the bright orange triangular profile of the car resembles many of the European supercars of today. Razor-sharp: General Motors' Le Sabre XP-8 (1951) was its first post-war concept car made of exotic sheet and honeycomb aluminum, several large magnesium castings, and fiberglass. It even had heated seats . Screen star: Hugely ahead of its time, the Buick Centurion XP-301 (1956) had no rear view mirror - replaced by a rear-mounted camera with a wide-angle lens and 4x6-inch view screen embedded in the dashboard . Space race: Influenced by the Skyray jet, General Motors' 1953 Firebird XP-21 was the first gas turbine-powered car in the U.S. and described as a 'jet fighter on four wheels'. It proved too costly for mass production . Storm: The 1959 Cadillac Cyclone XP-74 had a soaring bubble canopy, sweeping fenders and dramatic fins - all cues from jet aircraft. Its proximity-sensing radar was a forerunner to beeping sensors found in modern cars . Streamlined: The 1955 Chrysler Ghia was designed by Italian Giovanni Savonuzzi who began a battle of the wedge, nicknaming his car Gilda after Rita Hayworth's sleek title character in the film noir of the same name . The exhibition opens on May 22 and lasts . until September 7. It explores the designs through five themes: individual . makers, the impact of styling, visionary designers, the design process, . and the influence of automobile fairs. As well as the actual cars, the exhibition includes conceptual . drawings, patents and scale models. Museum director Michael Shapiro said: 'Our previous . exhibition was tremendously successful in bringing new audiences to the . museum. 'With Dream Cars, we continue our commitment to showcasing the importance of design and encouraging future innovation.' Back to the future: Concept cars took a leap in 1970 with the Ferrari Pininfarina 512 S Modulo, which was just 37 inches high. It had sliding doors and bowling ball-inspired orbs on the console in line with the wheels . King of the wedge: The 1970 Lancia Stratos HF Zero debuted months after the Ferrari and was four inches squatter. The seats are between the front wheels and the only way inside is by raising the perspex windshield . Leap forward: The exhibition includes modern concepts such as this 2001 BMW GINA (the N means Infinity), which has tensile fabric stretched over a moveable body frame of aluminum and flexible carbon fiber . Modern: The most recent concept car is the 2010 Porsche 918 Spyder, the first to address its own environmental impact. Unlike most of in the exhibition, the car has recently come on the market - for $850,000 .","Some bizarre concepts resemble cars today - others are out of this world .

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . Soft-top cars are most likely to be bought by women in their 50s, figures reveal. Nearly 7 per cent of females in that age group drive convertibles, say the insurers Diamond. While there are three times as many men buying soft-tops as there were 15 years ago, the number of women owners has quadrupled. Motor industry analysts say the boom is being driven by older women freed from the constraints of family car ownership. Mercedes SLK soft-top is the favourite vehicle with both men and women . Convertibles account for around 4 per cent – 1.3million – of the cars on Britain’s roads and the most likely owner is a female investment manager aged 51 to 60 driving a Mercedes costing more than £33,000. AA president Edmund King said: ‘Many women who have put family behind them can at last afford the car they want, rather than the car they need.’ Male buyers are also most likely in their 50s, according to figures based on 3.5million insurance policies. For both sexes, the next most common age group for owners is 41 to 50. Convertible ownership seems to follow income and family commitments. Younger women may not be able to afford one, while for young mothers they are less practical than a sports utility vehicle or family estate. The Mini Cooper is the second most popular car for women . So women below the age of 20 are least likely to have one at just 1.31 per cent. This increases to 2.76 per cent in their early-20s, 3.35 per cent in the mid-20s and 3.24 per cent in the late-20s. It then dips slightly to 3.01 per cent in the early-30s before rising again to 3.43 per cent in the late-30s and surging once the milestone of 40 is reached. Women are taken with more affordable models like Mini One and Mini Cooper convertibles, the Peugeot 206 and 307 CC coupe cabriolets, Volkswagen Beetle and Ford Streetka. And aside from investment managers, the top jobs of roadster ladies include company director, management consultant, merchant banker and marketing chief. Female lawyers, business consultants and sales managers are also addicted to getting the roof down. The AA said demand for new convertibles halved after the recession and a succession of wet summers before a resurgence in interest last year. They now account for around 4 per cent  of cars on Britain’s roads – 1.3 million in total. Mr King said: ‘People might imagine that convertible cars would have greatest appeal among younger drivers. But the realities of family life and affordability are most likely to dictate a choice of car that reflects their circumstances.’","Nearly 7 per cent of females in their 50s drive convertibles .

"By . Charlotte Kemp . As any woman with a generous bosom will tell you, there are certain items of clothing you don’t even bother trying on. For large busted women like Katie Price, a bra can make or break an outfit . Strapless dresses are definitely in the no-go camp. On the hanger they might promise summer glamour, but on anyone over a D-cup they’d almost certainly end up making the bust look saggy and wobbly, instead of pert and firm. The key issue is getting the right support. And this is where better-endowed women have been let down — because, until recently, strapless bras just haven’t been up to the task. Certainly, as a girl with an E-cup, the few times I’ve braved a strapless bra it’s been an unmitigated disaster. By far the worst embarrassment was at a ball as a top-heavy teen. The pesky thing offered such little support it started slipping down inside my strapless prom dress as I bopped away. When it made it to my stomach, I was forced to sidle off to the loos, whip it off and  abandon it. When you are wearing something so big it resembles Biggles’ flying helmet, there’s no way it’s going to fit in your tiny evening bag. My only experience as a bridesmaid was just as torturous. The beautiful mauve dress had a bustier top and this time I chose a strapless contraption that was so tight, my décolletage was flattened completely. I walked down the aisle cursing my unsightly mono boob. Ever since, I’ve avoided dresses that require secret scaffolding. The pesky thing . offered such little support it started slipping down inside my strapless . prom dress. When it made it to my stomach, I was forced to abandon it . But finally there might be hope for women like me. This summer, several new strapless bras have been launched in bigger cup sizes to rescue us busty ladies. Charlotte Elliston, buyer for upmarket lingerie retailer Rigby & Peller, says fit is vital. ‘The many common mistakes women make when purchasing a bra are all the more obvious when wearing a strapless garment,’ she says. ‘Most incorrectly-fitted women rely on the bra straps for support, but the majority of support in a bra should come from the back band, which should be a firm fit to the body.’ Charlotte explains this may mean going down a back size to ensure a snugger fit. The underwire, meanwhile, should sit just beneath the bust rather than on the rib cage, without pressing on any breast tissue. The right size cup will encase the breasts at the side and sit flatly against the chest at the front. With her advice in mind I put the best of the High Street strapless bras to the test, rating each one for fit and staying power — and how well they performed when it came to the all-important issue of sagging. Scroll down for video . Wonderbra Ultimate Strapless Lace Up to a  G-Cup Bra £36, Wonderbra.co.uk . This new Wonderbra has hand-shaped padding at the side to lift and support. It sits quite low on the chest, but pushes the boobs up well for just the right amount of cleavage. Firm hold thanks to the underwiring, moulded cups and silicone strips on the back band. To start with my breasts escaped from the cups, but once I’d got the positioning right, it gave great lift and shape. Fit: 4.5/5 . Staying power: 5/5 . Sag factor: LOW . Chantelle C Essential Bra £44, harrods.com . I . needed help to do this up; it has three hooks at the back and the . underwiring is very stiff. It sat lower than some beneath my boobs, so . pressed on my ribs a little. The cups were intended to envelop the . entire breast, but I was still spilling out a little at the top. A good . hold and a smooth line, but not the best lift. Fit: 3.5/5 . Staying power: 4/5 . Sag factor: LOW TO MEDIUM . All-Around Bandeau £59, spanx.com . A . comfier alternative to an underwire, though you have to be a . contortionist to get it on.

Unfortunately the stretchy fabric pressed down on my breasts instead of . lifting them, giving them a bit of a ski slope. Although it was comfy, . it didn’t give enough support or pertness. Fit: 3.5/5 . Staying power: 3/5 . Sag factor: MEDIUM . Black Ultimate Longline Body Solutions Strapless  A-E Bra £22.50, marksandspencer.com . The longer line gives this bra a glamorous look without creating too much wobbly cleavage. It has four hooks at the back, so I needed help to get into it, but it felt secure, held well and is available up to an E cup in three colours – black, white and a sugary pink. My only gripe was that the underwire comes up slightly too high at the side so it pressed a little on my breast tissue there. Great shape though. Some va va voom and lift without looking tarty. Fit: 4.5/5 . Staying  power: 5/5 . Sag factor: LOW . White Lace Five Way Convertible Strapless Bra £16, Debenhams.com . Well. What can I say? My cups overfloweth… In this bra, which does up at the . side and has a clear back strap so it can be worn under backless . dresses, I had cleavage to rival Dolly Parton’s and although my husband . liked it, I felt terribly exposed. When I put on the dress, the top . of my breasts got squashed giving me that dreaded ‘double boob’ look. The clear strap, meanwhile, looked like Sellotape. The bra generally . felt too loose and started to slip down after a while. It only goes up . to a DD — clearly not big enough to contain us busty girls. Fit: 3/5 . Staying power: 3/5 . Sag factor: MEDIUM . Low Back Strapless Bra Ultimo £35, ultimo.co.uk . If . it’s sexy cleavage you’re after, then this bra is for you. There was so . much lift, I couldn’t see my shoes. The moulded design has optional gel . pads that slip into the cup to boost your bust even further, but on me . this caused side overspill. The downside is it only goes up to a DD. This just about fitted me but there are other strapless styles catering . up to a G cup. Would be great under a halterneck low-back dress if you . want to show off your biggest assets but while it did lift and separate . excellently and gave a firm hold, the barmaid look is not for me. Fit: 4/5 . Staying power: 4.5/5 . Sag factor: LOW . Perle Moulded Strapless Bra by Prima Donna, £81.95, rigbyandpeller.com . This . bra gives a lovely rounded shape and a reasonable lift that feels age . appropriate. As a mother of three, these days, I don’t want to spill out . over the top like Jessica Rabbit. It’s very comfortable and feels . secure under the dress. Available in sizes up to a G cup in three . colours (black, nude and white) this bra can be worn with straps, too, . so it’s versatile. The downside is that it’s pricey, but the great fit . makes it a worthwhile summer investment. Fit: 5/5 . Staying power: 5/5 . Sag factor: LOW . Fashion Forms Go Bare Backless Strapless Push Up bra,£28, figleaves.com . This . self-adhesive bra is available up to a DD cup, which surely defies . gravity.

"By . Sara Malm . Britain’s most tattooed man has been refused a passport, but not because of his skin decorations - but his name. King of Ink Land King Body Art The Extreme Ink-Ite, 34, has been refused an ID renewal because of his unusual moniker, which he adopted by deed poll four years ago. The Lib Dem activist from Birmingham, formerly known as Mathew Whelan - now called Body Art for short – says it breaches his human rights to demand that he uses his birth name on his passport. Scroll down for video . Hard to ID: King of Ink Land King Body Art The Extreme Ink-Ite, known as Body Art for short, changed his name by deed poll five years ago and has now been told he cannot get a new passport . Body Art, who has covered 90 per cent . of his body in ink, including tattooing his left eyeball black, has . spent more than £25,000 on his passion. Now, he has been offered work abroad to turn his hobby into a job, and so applied to have his passport renewed. But . despite filling out the forms and sending the £72.50 fee, he received a . letter this week telling him the application had been rejected because . of his new name. The 34-year-old has changed his name twice, in 2007 and 2009, and his new moniker appears on his driving licence.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Distraught: The couple took supplements that made the mother seem pregnant. But when they got back to the UK they were arrested and the baby seized . A British couple ‘fell under the spell’ of Nigerian fraudsters who gave the woman herbal remedies and tricked her into thinking she had given birth, the High Court heard. The court was told how the husband and wife still cannot accept the baby girl they brought home from Nigeria two years ago is not their own – despite DNA tests proving they are not the natural parents. Social workers arrested the couple after they returned to the UK, accusing them of being knowing parties in the fraud. The court heard how the little girl is now ‘effectively an orphan’ with no prospect of ever learning who her real parents are – and faces growing up in the British care system. Now a judge has cleared the ‘intelligent, educated, hard working’ couple of any involvement in the scam, possibly paving the way for her to be returned to them. Family judge Mary Hogg told the court how for ten years the couple, who cannot be named, tried surgery, laser treatment and IVF to start a family – but to no avail. Then in 2010 the husband ran  into a university friend who told him of a couple who had had twins after ‘some herbal treatment’  in Nigeria. The desperate couple decided to travel to Africa, where they were prescribed a course of herbal remedies by a man calling himself Dr Cletus Okolo. After taking the herbs and returning to Britain, the woman’s face, arms and abdomen swelled as if she was pregnant. Even a ‘kindly and well-meaning’ local GP accepted she was seven months’ pregnant, and signed off a maternity certificate. The couple then returned to Nigeria for further treatment. Duped: The couple were told by a university friend to visit Dr Cletus Okolo in Nigeria's coastal city of Lagos where they were given herbs that made the mother swell up as if pregnant . At a clinic near the capital Lagos, they handed over £4,500 and the woman was given a brown liquid to drink before entering what she thought was a delivery room. The man waited in the corridor outside and, after few minutes, he heard a baby cry. He entered the room to find the baby girl – referred to in court only as ‘A’ – lying on the bed beside his groggy wife. He was duped into believing he had seen the umbilical cord cut and was given a placenta in a plastic bag. After pocketing the couple’s money, Dr Okolo wrote: ‘Treatment successful, patient delivered of a baby girl. All fees paid. God’s doing’, which was the sole document that accompanied the birth. After returning home to the UK they were arrested and A was taken into police protection. To the couple’s ‘considerable dismay and shock’, DNA tests proved that the girl was not their child. Cleared: Mrs Justice Hogg ruled the 'intelligent, educated, hard-working' couple were unaware of the scam . Having waited so long for a baby, the couple simply could not accept the truth, the court heard. Far from seeing themselves as victims, they insisted that ‘the combination of spiritual and herbal treatments was so powerful as to be able to change DNA’. But Mrs Justice Hogg said: ‘There is no evidence before me to say that the result of the DNA testing was wrong or likely to be wrong. I do not accept the explanation of the parents. ‘On that basis I have to accept the validity of the results and find that the baby is not the biological child of the putative parents.’ Social workers in the London Borough of Hillingdon, as well as the child’s court-appointed guardian, argued that the couple were ‘knowing parties to an elaborate fraud and charade upon the British immigration authorities and now parties to an attempted fraud on the court’. They claimed the couple’s account of the birth was ‘littered with inconsistency’ and implausibly embellished. Mrs Justice Hogg conceded: ‘At first blush, the immediate reaction of the ordinary man on the proverbial Clapham omnibus would no doubt be, “Don’t be daft, its a fraud, they knew it”.’ However, noting the ‘enormous difficulty’ the couple had had in conceiving a child, Mrs Justice Hogg took them at their word when they said they would ‘never seek to buy a baby’. She added: ‘Despite their education and intelligence, they are struggling with the result of the DNA test. Both of them say they still believe that A is their natural child. ‘In the end, having considered all the evidence... I am driven to conclude that in some way they allowed themselves to be duped by fraudsters. ‘They so much wanted a baby... they allowed themselves to fall under the spell of the herbalists, believing what was said to the mother and acting faithfully upon the instructions given to them. ‘Contrary to the submissions of the local authority and guardian I do not find that the parents were wilfully and knowingly involved with or parties to a wrongful removal of A from her mother, or that they cynically “bought” a baby.’ The Royal Courts of Justice heard the little girl, named only as A during proceedings, could spend life in care . The judge concluded: ‘What is clear to me, having found that she is not their biological child but the child of another mother and father, and having been removed from her mother very soon after her birth, is that A certainly is the victim of wrongdoing and illegality, and very possibly her mother as well. ‘The fact remains that A is effectively an orphan. There is no one in this country who has parental responsibility for her and no information as to her birth, parentage or background.’ Mrs Justice Hogg ordered a further hearing to decide where A’s best interests lie. Her finding that the couple were innocent dupes could improve their chances of persuading the court that A should be returned to them.","British couple spent 10 years trying surgery and IVF to conceive .

"By . Paul Cahalan . The Environment Agency has been accused of spiralling ‘out of control’ after it was revealed its staff claimed £12.8 million in expenses last year. The figure is up more than £3.8 million – or 43 per cent – on the previous 12 months. Just half of that rise could have covered the cost of river dredging that may have saved the Somerset Levels from flooding– work the beleaguered quango decided not to carry out. Environment Agency staff claimed £12.8 million in expenses last year. Just half of that rise could have covered the cost of river dredging that may have saved the Somerset Levels from flooding (Moorland pictured) A Freedom of Information request revealed that in the year to March 2013, the agency spent  £2.9 million on hotels, £8.8 million on train travel and £1.1 million on meals for staff working away from home. Bryony Sadler, whose Somerset home was flooded for three weeks, said: ‘The agency wrecked our homes and lives and we are getting nothing back. The expenses are inexcusable... they need to be justified.’ Ian Liddell-Grainger, the  Tory MP for Bridgwater in Somerset, said: ‘It is simply typical of the agency. It’s a quango out of control and it has lost all public confidence. ‘It has become an evangelical environmental group when it suits them, the rest of the time [staff] appear to be drinking expensive champagne in hotels.’ Ian Liddell-Grainger (right), the Tory MP for Bridgwater in Somerset, said: 'It is simply typical of the agency (chairman Lord Chris Smith pictured left) . It's a quango out of control and it has lost all public confidence' The agency said hotel expenses included bills such as meeting room hire; and that it would recoup some money from its ‘external partners’. A spokesman said: ‘One in five days in 2012 were in flood and we had to move our teams across the country to respond to numerous incidents.’ In the financial year which is just about to end, the agency has already spent £10 million, but the figures are incomplete. More than 7,000 homes were flooded this winter, with insurers’ last week saying they expected to pay out about £446 million in compensation.  Dredging stretches of the rivers Tone and Parrett before the floods would have cost the agency about £1.7 million.","The figure is up more than £3.8 million, or 43 per cent, on the previous year .

Frugal Kath Kelly, 51, ate at free buffets, shopped at church jumble sales and scrounged leftovers from grocery stores and restaurants. She picked fruit from bushes and trees and collected a staggering £117 in loose change dropped in the street - a third of her annual budget. Frugal: Teacher Kath Kelly has backed Iain Duncan Smith and said 'anybody' can live on a daily budget of £7 a day by eating at free buffets, shopping  at church jumble sales and scrounging leftovers . Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith was challenged to live on £53-a-week by benefits claimant David Bennett on Radio 4 . Ms Kelly, from Bruton, Somerset, . even managed a free holiday in France by hitchhiking to the Channel . Tunnel and persuading a French woman to take her as a passenger. Yesterday she agreed with the Work and Pensions Secretary, who said that anybody can live on £53 a week. She . said: 'Anyone can do it, I found that myself but for people who start . with more it will be more difficult for them to come down. 'We . live completely differently now, I could still do it, parents would . find it more difficult agreeably but it's still do-able. There are . plenty of people around who do it. 'Things have gone up in price but in this climate the items are still available, you just have to know where to get them from. 'I have every confidence that somebody can put their mind to it and do it easily. You start to think about what you . need, not what you want but what you actually need. It's surprising how . much you can cut out that way. 'It comes down to a few things and that's when you work out what you will spend.' The . English teacher began her challenge in June 2006 when she bet her . friends she could live on £1 a day for a year to save for her brother's . wedding. Challenge: Ms Kelly soon learned to spot a bargain and regularly visited supermarkets and butchers at the end of the day to buy reduced bread and vegetables . Ongoing: Ms Kelly gave up her challenge once it was completed, but she has said she still lived as frugally as she did before, spending around £6 or £7 a day . She soon learned to spot a bargain . and regularly visited supermarkets and butchers at the end of the day to . buy reduced bread and vegetables. And . even though she gave up her challenge once it was completed, Ms Kelly . said she still lived as frugally as she did before, spending around £6 . or £7 a day. 'When it comes down to food it is easy, there are bargains, freebies and common plants you can forage for', she said. 'You just have to know when to get to certain supermarkets to get the deals. 'The . plants are grown anywhere, even at this time of year, you just have to . look for chickweek, nettles, wild garlic or young beech leaves - 80g of . that is your five-a-day. 'It is more difficult when you have a family, I was single when I lived off £1 a day, but I still think you could do it. 'Even . with kids you just need to look up things to do on the internet, there . are so many free things in and around where you live. You don't need to . spend money down the pub, yes it's nice to do that but you don't need . to. 'We are used to . many treats in our culture but we don't have to spend money. You can . even do it with your friends, they don't have to spend money either. 'As for the bills, my rent included my bills so I did well that way. It didn't include internet or phone though. 'I used the library to send emails and keep in contact with friends, they allow you to get a couple of hours free.' Ms Kelly, who lives with partner Bruce Taylor, said it would be difficult for Iain Duncan Smith to live on the small amount given what he was used to, but that it would be easy once he got used to the idea. She said: 'I don't think it is difficult but I think it would be harder for somebody like him. 'I would love him to do it and if he wants some advice I'm here to help.' Breadline: After he was challenged, Mr Duncan Smith insisted he would take 'no bloody lessons' from those calling for him to live on £53 a week, saying he had been on the breadline twice . Mr Duncan Smith was challenged to live on £53 a week during an interview on Radio 4 in which he defended wide-ranging cuts to welfare which took effect earlier this week. The Work and Pensions Secretary said the Coalition's benefits reforms would allow people to 'break free' of welfare dependency. But when challenged on whether he could live on £7.57 per day, Mr Duncan Smith replied: 'If I had to, I would.' An online petition then calling on Mr Duncan Smith to live for a year on £53 a week, which had been seized on by Labour MPs opposing cuts to the vast welfare budget, attracted almost 300,000 signatures by the following night. But Mr Duncan Smith insisted he would take ‘no bloody lessons’ from those calling for him to live on the small sum, saying he had been on the breadline twice. He accused Labour and the BBC of fuelling a ‘stunt’ after he made the suggestion he could survive on that amount. A little goes a long way as the saying goes, but living off just £1-a-day really is making the pennies count. So how did Kath Kelly get by with an annual budget of £365 and what did she spend her money on: .","Kath Kelly ate at free buffets and picked fruit from bushes .

"By . Leesa Smith . Images released have revealed the extent of the damage to the tail of a Virgin plane that flew 13 times after a turbulence event on approach to Sydney. The frightening pictures show gaping cracks along the lower left and lower right tailplane of the 68 passenger ATR72 turbo-prop, which was removed from service while an inspection was carried out but put back in the air the next day. An initial investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) found damage 'consistent with an overstress condition' was likely to have occurred on February 20. The Virgin plane with cracks under the tail has flown 13 times after experiencing turbulence on approach to Sydney . The plane was back in the air the next day after an inspection was carried out . It was not until five days later, following a suspected bird strike as the plane descended into Albury, that the damage linked to the February 20 event was discovered. In the five-day period, the plane had already flown 13 more times. According to the ATSB report, it was about 4.40pm on February 20 when, as the aircraft made its approach to Sydney at an altitude of 8500 feet, that 'the crew noticed the air speed going up quickly and the speed trend excessively high'. The first officer reduced engine power and used touch-control steering to temporarily disconnect the autopilot before manually raising the nose to control the speed. But the captain was unsure if the first officer's control inputs were sufficient to avoid an 'overspeed' and put one of his hands on the controls and disconnected the autopilot to raise the nose further. The damage was not found until five days later, following a suspected bird strike as the plane descended into Albury . 'The captain believed he indicated his intention to take over control, and while the first officer could not recall it being verbalised, he was aware of the captain's actions,' the report says. 'The first officer recalled that he took his hands off the controls, releasing touch-control steering in the process. Shortly after, concerned about a high nose-up attitude, the first officer put his hands back on the controls. To both crew members, what happened next was unexpected and unclear.' 'Suddenly, the crew felt high positive (G-force), the controls felt different and spongy, and cockpit warnings activated.' 'At some point, the cabin crew called the cockpit and advised that the senior cabin crew member had injured her leg and that it might be broken.' The inspection on February 25 'found broken carbon plies, cracked joint sealant, and deformation in and around the area where the horizontal stabiliser attaches to the vertical stabiliser'. 'There was also some minor damage to the rudder,' the report says. The ATSB says its initial examination showed that 'differential force on the control column that resulted from the captain and first officer applying an opposing force exceeded the differential force required to generate a pitch disconnect'. 'Each pilot was then controlling the elevator on their side of the aircraft in opposite directions for a brief period before the first officer released his control column.' The ATSB investigation is ongoing. In a brief statement, Virgin Australia said the safety of guests, crew and aircraft was its No.1 priority. 'While this is an isolated issue, we are working with the ATSB, the aircraft manufacturer and our maintenance provider to identify what has occurred,' the airline said.","Images have been released of the cracks on the tail of the plane .

"By . Harriet Arkell . With its elegant ballroom, banqueting hall, rolling acres and lake, Grade I-listed Halswell House looks as if it should be worth several million pounds. But the Palladian mansion, once described by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as 'the most important house of its date in the country', is for sale at a knockdown £250,000 after being repossessed when its owner was declared bankrupt. For the price of a one-bedroom flat in one of London's less exclusive areas, you could pick up one of Britain's finest country mansions that comes with beautiful Tudor buildings and 30 acres of lush Somerset land. And, like anything of a certain age, it also has a rather interesting past. Scroll down for video . Dream home: And Halswell House near Bridgwater in Somerset could be yours for as little as £250,000 when it comes up for auction next month priced for a quick sale . Stately grandeur: The banqueting hall at Halswell boasts intricate cornicing, high ceilings and a polished wooden floor - one of many elegant rooms . Halswell House is said to be worth about £3million after it was bought by businessman Grahame Bond in 2004 and underwent a massive refurbishment. The property, which has been used as a luxury wedding venue in recent years, has a somewhat chequered history. In 2009 the police were called after a mass orgy broke out during a black-tie ball organised by a Dutch adult entertainment firm that had hired it out for the night. And in July 2012, Mr Bond's then 78-year-old mother, Stella Bond, staged a three-day sit-in in the library to prevent it being repossessed by bailiffs.  Mrs Bond sat in an armchair in the wood-panelled library for 72 hours as bailiffs watched her, hour after hour, ready to take the house if she left. Mrs Bond, who lived in a house on the estate, began her sit-in when bailiffs turned up to take the house while her former estate agent son was out.  The grandmother of four who has osteoporosis and had suffered a stroke in 2006, said the bailiffs could not provide her with paperwork proving they could take possession, so she took up position in the library with a young carer by her side. She said of the bailiffs: 'They were quite intimidating but I stayed put.  One man was quite irritating - he thought he could move me by talking to me, but of course he couldn't.' Room to spare: The house, which was once the site of an orgy, boasts both Palladian and Tudor architecture, and several suites and bedrooms . History: Halswell's Tudor buildings date back to 1536 when they were built for Robert Halswell, whose son Nicholas went on to become the local Bridgewater MP . Divorcee Mrs Bond, who was evacuated . to Somerset from London during the Blitz, said: 'It took a lot of hard . work to restore this house, it was so dilapidated. 'My son had a dream for a long time to put a stately home back together again. It is beautiful – I was not going to let it go.’ The bailiffs were eventually called . off but despite Mrs Bond's best efforts, Halswell House was subsequently . repossessed by the mortgage lender Citi Private Banking, and is now . being sold on its behalf. Halswell has been described by architectural historian Marcus Binney as 'possibly the most perfect house in the British Isles' in his 2007 book In Search Of The Perfect House - 500 Of The Best Buildings In Britain And Ireland. Former owner: Halswell is for sale because it was repossessed after businessman Grahame Bond, 48, pictured here in front of the house was declared bankrupt . Mr Bond's indomitable mother, Stella Bond, now 79, last year staged a three-day sit-in in an armchair in Halswell's panelled library to prevent bailiffs taking the house . The bargain-basement guide price was drawn up by specialist land and property auctioneers Clive Emson. Five estate houses are also being offered in separate lots at next month's the sale, but the entire collection could be sold in one go if there is sufficient interest from people who want to acquire virtually their own hamlet. The guide price for everything is between £650,000 to £960,000.The vast estate sits in Halswell Park in Goathurst near Bridgwater. Graham Barton, of Clive Emson auctioneers, said: 'This is a unique opportunity to acquire in broad terms your own hamlet. View from the terrace: Halswell House comes with 31 acres of beautiful Somerset countryside and the owner will enjoy splendid isolation . Glamorous party venue: Grade I-listed Haslwell House has in recent years been let out by Mr Bond for parties, weddings and other events . Historic: The Tower House is another lot for sale on the Halswell Estate and has four double bedrooms, a large garden, and a guide price of just £80,000-£100,000 . 'The mansion and Tudor manor are set in 30 acres of Somerset countryside and this comprises one lot. 'There are also five houses on the estate in separate lots but we reserve the right to sell everything at once should there be interest from people wanting to acquire virtually their own hamlet. 'The mansion house is in an elevated position with breath-taking rural views over the Somerset countryside. 'The Tudor manor house does need some investment but the mansion is in fair condition and any new owner could move in. 'Halswell House is ready to become a magnificent private home once again, although it will interest investors with a variety of plans. 'Opportunities to bid on something of this scale and of such historical and architectural importance are astonishingly rare.' Quantock Cottage, which lies on the estate, offers three double bedrooms and one bathroom and has a guide price of £80,000 - £100,000, though the auctioneer admits it 'would benefit from modernisation' For sale in a separate lot is Parkhead, a large, semi-detached country house offering four good sized bedrooms, garaging, and a large garden - the guide price is £115,000-£130,000 . Outside space: Parkhead also comes with some smart outbuildings complete with battlements where the new owner can park several cars, or even horses . The Tudor house on the estate was built in 1536 for Robert Halswell and it passed down the family, one of whose members was Sir Nicholas Halswell, who became MP for Bridgwater in 1603. Later the Halswells married into the wealthy Somerset Tynte family and Sir Halswell Tynte oversaw the development of the 17th century mansion including the huge Palladian block that looks north towards the Bristol Channel. In the 18th century, Sir Charles Tynte made substantial improvements to both houses, renovated the earlier formal garden, and erected follies and other elements.  There is a grotto, temple, ruins, as well as a large dovecote. With a guide price of £60,000-£70,000, Gardener's Cottage has two large bedrooms (although the auctioneer notes that one has no natural light), and a 'highly enviable rural location' Groom's Cottage, offered for sale with a guide price of £50,000-£60,000, is said to need 'enhancement', and offers a kitchen/living room, bedroom, bathroom and garden . In 1923 a fire caused extensive damage but the house was rebuilt at great expense, and during the Second World War it served as a girls' school, while some of the land was made a camp for Italian prisoners of war. The National Trust declined the opportunity to take on the house when owner Lord Wharton put it up for sale after the war.  The aristocrat went to London with his boyfriend and his sister went to South Africa in what was a scandal at the time.  The estate was then sold and broken up, before being bought by a local property developer who turned it into several bedsits.  It was later owned by a Muslim group before Mr Bond bought it for £1.94million in 2004. The Halswell estate will be auctioned on 17 December at the St Mellion International Resort in Cornwall. Halswell House was the setting for an orgy after its owner, Grahame Bond, let it to a company thinking they wanted to hold a masked ball there. More than 350 well-heeled partygoers flocked to the historic house for the £65-a-head ball, parking their Porsches, Aston Martins and BMWs outside. But the astonished owner said that the elegant ball turned into a heaving orgy as if 'at the flick of a switch'. Masked partygoers: Grahame Bond hired his house for £9,000 thinking it would host a masked ball, but suddenly it turned into an orgy . Mr Bond said: 'The party started normally and the whole group were dressed in these great costumes. 'But then one of the organisers announced: ""The moment has come, the spell has begun"", and everyone began kissing and having sex. 'To say I was shocked was an understatement.  When the haze from the dry ice cleared we realised it was going on everywhere. 'That's when the penny dropped that it was a swingers' party.' Mr Bond said that more than 350 guests arrived in expensive cars and wearing masks for the ball - this still from a video of the event shows a performer on stage . Stunning venue: This picture from the party organisers' website, shows another performer in the splendid surroundings of Halswell House . Mr Bond, who had hired out his house for £9,000 for the night of the party in July 2009, sent his younger members of staff home and called police, but was told they were powerless to act because it was a private party. The house had been booked by Dutch events company Little Sins, who told Mr Bond that 'there was a dating aspect' to the party, but he had not understood that that meant it would be an orgy.","Halswell House in Bridgwater, Somerset, is one of Britain's finest houses and boasts Tudor buildings and 31 acres .

"By . Kirk Maltais . A sheriff's county deputy in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is fighting to get his job back after driving his drunk friends around in his police vehicle and allowing them to use the car's loudspeaker to heckle passers-by, particularly women. The vehicle was driven by Rodrigo Mello, 33, a deputy with the Broward County Sheriff's Office for nearly a decade. According to authorities, Mello was off-duty when he took his two drunk friends on a joyride through Las Olas, a popular nightlife district, in his marked 2007 Dodge Charger. 'Girls, put your vaginas back in your . pants' the speaker from the car kept repeating, a hot dog vendor that . witnessed the heckling told the Orlando Sun-Sentinel. 'They're saying extremely lewd and really stupid things over the P.A.' one caller told 911. Most witnesses who called expressed disbelief that there was an officer behind the wheel. Security footage showing Mello's vehicle driving through an alley. According to Mello, he was taking his drunk friends home when he decided to let one of them turn on the emergency lights and use the loudspeaker . Officers taking Mello and his friends into custody. According to witnesses, the occupants of the car were heckling pedestrians and making catcalls to passing women . 'They're saying rude comments and driving around. ... I don't think sheriffs would act like that,' one caller said. Mello was fired for the August 11, 2013 incident, but has since been fighting to be reinstated as a deputy. Mello is currently attempting an arbitration process to broker a way for him to return to work. However, he is meeting tough resistance from his former employer, who is refusing to reinstate him. According to the sheriff department's internal investigation, Mello had called in sick for his morning shift at 12:22am that evening, two and-a-half hours before he was stopped. He had texted his boss that he had 'food poisoning'. Surveillance cameras at different locations that evening caught the vehicle stopping in the middle of roadways, using emergency lights and yelling rude remarks at passers-by. According to the vendor, the car passed by at least three times in a half-hour, each time stopping to heckle him. 'Hey, how are your hot dogs? Those hot dogs any good?' the vendor, who . is not identified by name in the investigative report, said he heard. 'I . want a hot dog.' 'It was stupid as could be and I look back at it now and it's absolutely . ridiculous,' Mello later said in a sworn statement. 'It was innocent . fun. Now looking back at it, it was the stupidest decision I ever made . in my life.' Pictured: Rodrigo Mello, 33, the deputy terminated on January 14 in relation to the incident . Mello is attempting to get reinstated as a deputy with the Broward County Sheriff's Office. An arbitrator has yet to be appointed . According to his statement, Mello said he had joined a group of about . 10 gym friends at a bar on Las Olas Boulevard about 9pm. He . said that had two or three alcoholic drinks during the three or four hours he was . there, and he did 'not at all' feel intoxicated. After leaving the first, the group went to another in the same area. By the end of the evening, Mello agreed to drive his 'extremely intoxicated' friends home. Mello said his friend remarked that he'd never been in a police car . before, so Mello 'flashed his lights once' and gave him permission to . say something over the P.A. system. Mello did not recall anything lewd . or offensive being said. Sheriff's Capt. Fernando Gajate reportedly found Mello sitting on the curb with one of his friends who was in the vehicle. The other occupant of the vehicle was found laying in a grassy knoll. 'It was an absolute stupid decision,' Mello said, according to the . investigative report. 'I've brought embarrassment to myself, my family, . the department.' Gajate received a written reprimand for allegedly failing to take suitable action, according to the report. He opted to send Mello home after taking his vehicle. According to Gajate, Mello did not show any signs of being drunk, such as bloodshot eyes and slurred words. Since his January 14, 2014 firing, Mello has been fighting to get his job back. He was terminated for lack of discretion, conduct unbecoming and having unauthorized passengers in his vehicle. An arbitrator has not yet been selected for Mello's fight regarding the termination. According to Mello's LinkedIn page, he began working for a small law enforcement training firm as the Chief Logistics Officer after his departure from his previous job. On his page, he also claimed to have been awarded a Medal of Honor while working with the Broward County Sheriff's Office.","'Girls, put your vaginas back in your pants' said occupant of police vehicle driven by deputy Rodrigo Mello .

"By . Darren Boyle . A British teenager is still fighting for his life in a Turkish hospital after being slashed and stabbed while on holiday. Callum Copson, 19, from Kennoway, near St Andrews, has undergone ten hours of life-saving surgery but is not out of the woods yet according to doctors. Mr Copson suffered a massive wound to his stomach and had to squash his intestines back inside with his own hands, after being sliced with the jagged edge of a fruit knife after a row over a handbag. Callum Copson, left, was stabbed in the stomach on Thursday when he went to the leather shop in Marmaris to exchange a bag with his girlfriend Erin Brown, right, who is maintaining a round-the-clock vigil by his bedside . The row, which took place in the . popular Turkish resort of Marmaris, Turkey, on Wednesday, left him . clutching his intestines and sobbing 'I don't want to die'. Consultant surgeon, Dr Ozgur Basaran, said: 'We operated as soon as Callum arrived. 'He'd suffered severe injuries and we had to go in through a main artery. 'Due . to the severity and extent of his injuries we had to operate twice. The . first surgery took six hours and the second a further four hours. After that Callum was admitted to intensive care and monitored round the clock.' Dr . Basaran, who works at Marmaris private Ahu Hetman Hospital, added: . 'Today we have removed Callum's nasal tubes but due to the extent of the . damage we're unable to give a definite prognosis at this stage.' Mr . Copson jumped in to protect girlfriend Erin Brown, 18, after angry shop . staff started lobbing, belts, bags and shoes at her following a row . over a refund on a faulty bag last week. But . as Callum stepped in to shield Erin from the onslaught a 14-year-old . local boy snatched up a knife, dashed into the shop and plunged the . blade into Mr Copson's stomach then fled. British . tourists tried to help stem the flow of blood, as shocked the Scottish . teenager clutched his bleeding guts and begged for help. A row developed inside the leather shop in Marmaris, pictured, when Mr Copson was stabbed in the stomach . Eye-witness . Sandra Dempsey, 54, said: 'There was blood everywhere. You could see . his insides spewing out. It was unbelievably shocking. The poor lad just . kept repeating 'I don't want to die' over and over.' The furious row erupted in a leather shop in the popular tourist resort of Marmaris on Wednesday night. The . couple were staying at the Amore Hotel, had bought a bag in the shop on . Monday - but realising it was faulty returned to the shop a couple of . days later. Ms Brown told police: 'I asked for a refund and was told that wasn't possible but that I could pick a replacement bag. 'When I picked a bag the owner said it was too expensive so I asked for a refund again and that's when the argument started.' The shop was packed with customers as the row escalated. Ms Brown revealed: 'The shop staff started shouting and throwing bags, belts and purses at me. 'Callum . stepped in front to protect me and he and the shop owner carried on . arguing and throwing bags at each other, when all of a sudden a young . boy pushed past us and came face to face with Callum. 'I didn't see what happened but I saw his face and the flash of a blade in his hand before he ran off. 'Suddenly . there was blood everywhere. I realised Callum had been seriously hurt. He was shocked and kept saying: ""I don't want to die"" - it was awful. 'Other tourists tried to help us and I was screaming for an ambulance as Callum collapsed on the street.' Paramedics . raced to the scene and rushed Mr Copson to hospital were he underwent . the two life saving operations to repair the damage. Another . British eye-witness, who didn't want to be named, said: 'I was in the . shop with my young son when the couple came in and asked for a refund on . a faulty bag. 'Things seemed to spiral out of control very quickly and suddenly they were lobbing bags and belts at each other. 'The . next minute the lad collapsed in a pool of blood, clutching his . stomach. It was a gruesome scene and I covered my young son's eyes. 'It . was a blood bath and everyone was in shock. The injured lad was . terrified. Fortunately paramedics arrived on the scene in minutes and . took him to hospital - I pray his ok.' Callum Copson's parents Eric and Lorraine have rushed from their home in Leven, near St Andrews to join a bedside vigil for the teen . Following the attack 14-year-old Mehmet Karabulut, was taken to the police by his father who works in the bag shop. Karabulut, . who, according to family friends, has mental-health issues, told his . dad and the police that he could remember holding a blood stained knife . but nothing more. He was remanded in custody by a judge who has ordered a psychiatric evaluation of the troubled teen. Family . friend Nadir Koyunbakan said: 'Mehmet has some psychiatric problems. He . snatched the knife and stabbed the British boy when he saw him arguing . with his boss. 'We are . devastated for Callum Copson and his family. They are guests in Turkey . and this should never have happened. We are so very sorry.' Mr . Copson, who works for frozen food giant Iceland, has come through both . life-saving operations and is said to be in a 'stable' condition . according to friends. Callum's parents, Eric and Lorraine Copson, flew out from Scotland to join Ms Brown's vigil at their son's bedside. The . Foreign Office confirmed they have been alerted about the incident.

"By . Paul Harris . There were six smiling faces before horror and tragedy struck. Now there were six little coffins, six stolen lives. One by one, the bodies of five young brothers and their ten-year-old sister were laid to rest yesterday exactly six weeks after an arson attack at their home. Scores of neighbours, friends and relatives stood in silence as a cortege of horse-drawn carriages made its solemn procession through streets cleared of traffic along the route to the children's funeral. Scroll down for video... Emotional: Pallbearers had tears in their eyes as they carried the children's coffins out of the church while family and friends sobbed and hugged each other . But two faces were missing. The . youngsters' parents Mick and Mairead Philpott – in jail awaiting trial . for their murder – were refused leave to attend amid fears they would . provoke what was described as a 'lynch mob' atmosphere at which their . safety could not be guaranteed. The couple had been branded 'scum' by . members of the public during two court appearances, and Father Alan . Burbidge, who was helping to organise the funeral – paid for by members . of the public – had warned the ceremony would be 'very difficult' if the . parents attended. And so, in a service attended by . mourners wearing brightly coloured clothes and carrying single yellow . roses, six white coffins bearing each child's name were buried in their . absence. Instead, other family members led a packed congregation in . prayer at St Mary's Roman Catholic church in Derby before a private . burial nearby. Each coffin was decorated with a motif relating to the brief life of the children, aged between five and 13. Respect: A man throws rose petals over Jade Philpott's coffin as her step brother Mikey, (bottom left) helps to carry it out of St Mary's Catholic Church in Derby town centre following the children's funeral service . Final journey: The children were taken to Nottingham Road Cemetery, Chaddesden, to be buried in a private service for the family . There was a fairytale princess for . ten-year-old Jade, whose casket was borne in a carriage pulled by white . horses in pink livery. For Duwayne, 13, it was the emblem of . Derby County football club; toy soldiers for John, nine; a Peppa Pig . character on a Nintendo screen for Jack, eight; a wrestling logo for . Jesse, six; and a dinosaur cartoon character for Jayden, five. Individual school photos of them in . their blue uniforms adorned the order of service for a two-hour requiem . mass. Classmates in the same uniform filed into the pews, some weeping. Their head teacher was among those who spoke about their short but happy . lives. Tragic end: Five of the six children died in the blaze at the semi-detached house in Allenton, Derby, in the early hours of May 11. Duwayne died two days later in Birmingham Children's Hospital . Through the streets: The carriage holding Jade's coffin led the cortege as it passed through the Derby streets following the emotional funeral . Pink fan: White horses with plumes of pink feathers and pink flags pulled the pink carriage containing Jade's coffin . No expense spared: The children also had their names spelled out in floral tributes that rested on top of each of the carriages . Solemn: The coffins of Jade, 10, Jayden, five and Jessie, six, are carried into St Mary's Catholic Church in Derby town centre ahead of the funeral service . Procession: Two white horses sporting pink plumes of feathers had pulled . the carriage containing Jade's coffin while five others containing the . bodies of her brothers followed on behind . Heartbreaking: Featuring a picture of a pink princess, Jade's coffin was carried at the front of the procession into St Mary's . Celebration amid sadness: The white coffins containing the body of John, nine, (left) and his younger brother Jack, eight, (right) follow on behind. John's coffin was printed with toy soldiers . But the children's story was most . poignantly told by profiles and tributes understood to have been . compiled for the order of service by their siblings from what was once a . family of 17. Together they painted a dramatically different picture . from the tragedy that befell them. Duwayne was described as a 'charming . and caring young boy' on the threshold of becoming a young man – a . football fan and music lover who was learning to play the violin. As the . oldest of the six he became a 'protector' for his younger brothers and . sister. Jade was 'a beautiful princess with a . permanent smile on her face... always full of energy'. She was part of . the chaplaincy team at school and had a talent for boosting class . morale. Floral tributes adorn the pavement outside the family's house in Derby . A celebration of their lives: The order of service featured a picture of all six children on the front and emotional tributes to each of them inside . 'Protector': Eldest child Duwayne, 13, was described as a 'charming and caring young boy' and a 'real ladies man' in the order of service . 'Mother hen': Only girl Jade, 13, became a 'mother hen to her younger brothers' always carrying them around on her hip . 'Cheeky chappy': John, nine, had a 'daredevil personality' but his teachers described him as 'cheerful, smiley and polite' 'Quiet': Jack, eight, was 'cute, cuddly and content with everything' and was the quietest of his siblings who loved to watch Peppa Pig . 'Mischievous': Jesse, six, was 'crazy, clumsy and cheerful' and a little boy who will be remembered for his loving nature . 'Baby': Nicknamed the 'miracle baby' because he was early, Jayden, five, was 'bouncy and hyper-active' and had a penchant for crisps . Upset: Mourners were urged to wear bright colours but they could not contain their grief as they walked into the church for the children's funeral service . Brave: Relatives weep as they follow the children's coffins into the church. A death notice placed in the announcements section of a local newspaper paid tribute to the children. It read: 'They all touched the hearts of so many' Gathering: Huge crowds assembled outside the church across a footbridge, their colourful brollies shielding from the rain that had just started to fall . Assembling: Members of the public gather outside St Mary's church as the Philpott children's coffins are carried in . Too young for such grief: Many of the mourners were children, who cried as they watched the coffins being carried into and out of St Mary's . Haunting: The tragic six Philpott children posed for a photograph together without their siblings before their death. From clockwise, Duwayne, John, Jayden, Jade, Jesse and Jack . Charged: The children's parents Mick and wife Mairead Philpott, seen here weeping at a press conference in May following the devastating fire at their home have been charged with their murder and were not at the funeral . Shell: The fire swept through the children's home in Allenton, Derby as they slept in their beds. Mr and Mrs Philpott are set to go on trial for murder in January 2013 . John was described as 'a cheeky . chappie, always lively and ready to pick a fight with all the boys' but . 'cheerful, smiley and polite', while Jack was 'a real pretty boy with . bright blue eyes... cute, cuddly and content with everything'. Jesse 'would come in from the garden . head to toe mucky' and was 'very mischievous', and Jayden, the 'baby of . the family' was 'mothered by Jade' and could eat seven packets of crisps . in one go. The six died on May 11 when the . council semi in Victory Road, Allenton, was set ablaze with petrol at . the front door. They were asleep upstairs and were killed by inhaling . smoke. A neighbour who witnessed firemen and paramedics battling to . rescue and revive them described a tragic aftermath of 'little bodies in . pyjamas on the pavement'. Earlier this month the couple were . abused and called 'scum' when they appeared for the first time in court. Yesterday some of the same people who attended that hearing threw . flowers and shed tears in the rain as pall bearers carried the coffins . one behind the other into church. Earlier, police closed roads and . marshalled traffic along a normally busy ring road to allow the . horse-drawn carriages' procession. The funeral was paid for by donations . of more than £11,000 from the local community after residents set up a . drive to raise money. In May, the Osmaston Community Association of Residents (Oscar) began collecting money after appealing in the local press. At the time, the children's parents . were not regarded as suspects and Oscar was named as the family's . officially approved organisation. Sponsored walks, money collections and . fundraising events were organised in the weeks after the tragedy. Philpott, 55, and his 31-year-old . wife, who has the children's names tattooed on one arm, had pleaded to . be allowed to attend the funeral on compassionate grounds. Prison . service officials carried out a 'risk assessment' in conjunction with . police but refused permission. Yesterday – somewhere miles away – they remained in separate jails for the children's final farewell.

"By . Associated Press . Volunteer researchers have uncovered mass graves in a South Texas cemetery that they believe contain the bodies of immigrants who died crossing into the U.S. illegally, according to published reports Saturday. The discovery at Sacred Heart Burial Park in Falfurrias came in the last two weeks, as Baylor University anthropologist Lori Baker and Krista Latham, a forensic anthropologist at the University of Indianapolis, and their students worked as part of a multi-year effort to identify immigrants who have died in the area near the U.S.-Mexico border. Teams unearthed remains in trash bags, shopping bags, body bags or without a container at all. Mass graves: Dr. Lori Baker with the Baylor University and members of her team students, (left to right) Audrey Murchland, 20, and Marissa Salley, 21, catalog a set of bone after they were exhume from the Sacred Heart Burial Park May 20, 2013 in Falfurrias, Texas . Untimely deaths: A forensic anthropology team from Baylor University place the remains of unidentified immigrants exhumed from a cemetery on May 21, 2013 in Falfurrias, Texas . The Corpus Christi Caller Times reports that in one burial, bones of three bodies . were inside one body bag. In another, at least five people in body bags . and smaller plastic bags were piled on top of each other. Skulls also . were found in biohazard bags placed between coffins. They exhumed 110 unidentified people from the cemetery in 2013. This summer, researchers have performed 52 exhumations, but because some remains were stored together, further study will be needed to determine exactly how many bodies have been recovered, Baker said. Researchers told the newspaper that some remains were found under small, temporary grave markers bearing the name of local funeral home Funeraria del Angel Howard-Williams. Brooks and Jim Hogg county officials said they pay the funeral home to handle bodies recovered in the remote parts of South Texas, an area that's often deadly for immigrants from Mexico and Central America who set out on foot through ranchlands amid sweltering temperatures to avoid a nearby U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint. More than 300 people died crossing through Brooks County alone between 2011 to 2013 - representing more than 50 per cent of the deaths in Texas' sprawling Rio Grande Valley. Proper burial: The bodies will be examined and cross-checked with DNA sent from Mexico and Central American countries, with the goal of reuniting the remains with families . Unclaimed bodies: Teams from Baylor University and the University of Indianapolis are exhuming the bodies of more than 50 immigrants who died, mostly from heat exhaustion, while crossing illegally from Mexico into the United States . Brooks County Chief Deputy Benny Martinez said the funeral home charges $450 to handle each body. County Judge Raul Ramirez said it been handling such remains for at least 16 years. Chief Sheriff's Deputy Lorenzo Benavides in neighboring Jim Hogg County says the practice has been going there as long as he can remember, at least 22 years. A message left Saturday at Howard-Williams was not immediately returned. The funeral home referred the newspapers' questions to its parent company, Houston-based Service Corporation International. 'No matter if this is one of our client families we serve on a traditional basis or a migrant family's loved one we're serving and we don't have any identification of the loved one, I do want to let you know it is our policy to treat the decedent with care, to treat them just like we would treat anyone else,' Service Corporation International Spokeswoman Jessica McDunn told the newspaper. Puzzle: Many of the bodies were buried together in bags and piled on top of each other, making it difficult to determine how many people were buried there . Grim task: Jessica Campbell and Justin Maiers with the University of Indianapolis archeology & forensics laboratory digging up a casket at the Sacred Heart Burial Park in Falfurrias . McDunn said the funeral home has 'certain records related to these burials, but this does not amount to confirmation that Howard-Williams was involved in depositing the remains in the manner the researchers described.' The funeral home would not give the newspaper access to those records. Still, Latham called the discovery appalling. Baker said bodies that were not already skeletonized before burial were found in varying states of decomposition. 'To me it's just as shocking as the mass grave that you would picture in your head, and it's just as disrespectful,' Latham told the Caller Times. Eddie Canales, an immigrant rights advocate who has worked to try and prevent immigrant deaths on the long and arduous trail they take through Brooks County establishing water stations says the dead deserve dignity in death. 'I think it’s very hard for people to connect in the fact that these were human beings,' he told the Caller Times. 'It just goes to the language, to the words, and words mean a lot: ""All these were illegals."" Even in death, they wound up not getting the proper respect.'","Researchers have discovered a mass grave they believe contains the bodies of immigrants who died crossing the border .

"By . Abigail Frymann . All change: Harrison Kershaw, 8, has developed narcolepsy and cataplexy since having the swine flu jab in 2010 . A football-loving boy has developed a rare sleeping disorder that means he has to sleep up to seven times a day - after having an inoculation against swine flu. Harrison Kershaw was a happy youngster, and like many boys, loved nothing more than a game of football. But that was before he had his jab three years ago. Harrison, now aged eight, has narcolepsy and cataplexy, meaning he can collapse into sleep up to seven times a day. His mother, Leanne, who lives in Farnworth, Greater Manchester, says he is now 'unrecognisable' to the son she knew before the injection. She said: 'A month after he was given the injection I noticed he started to sleep a lot more in the day, and when he was overcome with emotion his muscles would flop. 'Now he has doubled in weight and is unrecognisable to before he had the vaccine.' Harrison, a pupil at the Cherry Tree . Primary School in Farnworth, now has to have two planned naps a day at . school, and his parents, Leanne and Simon, have to take a wheelchair . with them in case he falls asleep and collapses. Family affair: Harrison's parents, Leanne and Simon Kershaw, have to take a wheelchair with him to school in case he falls asleep and collapses . Harrison's behaviour has also been severely affected by the condition. Leanne added: 'When someone with narcolepsy wakes up, it can feel like they've not slept for more than 72 hours. 'This means Harrison's behaviour can be very challenging because he feels exhausted and can be very grumpy. 'Unrecognisable': Harrison's mother says her son's behaviour has changed since he developed the rare disorders . 'Normal . sleep just doesn't keep him going and if he misses anything at school, . he will never be able to catch up. Even though he is on medication to . keep him awake, he still feels constantly tired. 'If . we are in the car he will fall asleep, and sometimes he will fall . asleep while he's eating, which means we have to make sure he doesn't . choke. 'It can be hard to deal with but it's not his fault. He can't help the way he behaves.' Harrison's narcolepsy meant he had to stop playing at his football team and now plays for a disability team. Leanne has since met with the parents of 18 other children who developed narcolepsy after having the flu jab. Law firm Hodge Jones & Allen have now started legal action against Pandemrix manufacturers GlaxoSmithKline on behalf of Harrison and 37 other Britons. A spokesman for GlaxoSmithKline said: 'Patient safety is our number one priority and we are actively researching how narcolepsy is triggered and how this vaccine might have interacted with other risk factors in affected individuals. 'We hope these ongoing research efforts will enable us to provide more answers.'","Harrison Kershaw has developed narcolepsy and cataplexy .

"By . Martin Robinson . The teacher who organised vile Thatcher ‘death parties’ and compared the Baroness to . Hitler, bought her council house using the Iron Lady's right-to-buy scheme and then doubled her money, it was revealed today. Romany Blythe, 45, made £150,0000 when she sold her North London home four years after buying it off the local authority in Islington. Lady Thatcher wanted to increase house ownership in the 1980s after she came to power, so she let council property residents snap them up for bargain prices from local authorities. And it appears that extreme anti-Thatcherite Miss Blythe used the scheme to make a huge sum of cash. Thatcher hater: Romany Blythe invited 5,000 to a party celebrating the Iron Lady's death, but years earlier bought a council house (right) using the landmark right-to-buy scheme, selling it for double what she paid . Sale: Documents show that Miss Blythe bought the house in Islington for £141,000 and then sold it four years later for £298,000 . In June 2006 Miss Blythe, of Worthing, West Sussex, bought the leasehold of a flat in a pretty Victorian townhouse from Islington Council for £141,000. Just four years later she sold the North London property for £298,000. If she had sold it within three years she would have had to repay some cash to the council. Speaking next to a burning effigy of the former Prime Minister at a demo last weekend in Trafalgar Sqaure, she said: 'The council houses were sold, what a wonderful thing to be able to own your own home and I have no problem with poorer people being able to buy their own home but that money went straight to central government. 'It wasn't used to build more council houses for people for affordable rents. Teachers have to come in to work from miles away. People can't afford to live in central London.' Protests: Miss Blythe, who specialises in teaching troubled children, wrote: 'Who wants to p*** on her grave?' as she encouraged people to celebrate Lady Thatcher's death . She added: 'I think Thatcher was a despot. She was cold, calculating and she knew exactly what she was doing. Surgery: Romany Blythe was given breast implants on the NHS because she complained of low self-esteem, it also emerged . 'I don't care about Thatcher, I didn't care about her dying, I don't care about celebrating her death. I care about the issues and I care about being able to mark that. 'I am not interested in celebrating someone's death, I am interested that there is a whitewash of who she was, and that she is not made out to be some wonderful woman. 'History does not forget' Mss Blythe was unavailable for comment today. Romany Blythe called Lady Thatcher a despot and said: ‘They danced in the streets when Hitler died, too’. The 45-year-old – who was given breast implants on the NHS because she complained of low self-esteem – had sparked outrage by creating an internet page called: ‘The witch is dead.’ On it she urged more than 5,000 people to attend a death party in central London on Monday. Miss Blythe, who specialises in teaching troubled children, wrote of Lady Thatcher: ‘Who wants to p*** on her grave?’ She later attempted to defend her behaviour by claiming she was ‘the voice of reason’. ‘I didn’t do the rioting – I just organised a Facebook page. I’m actually the voice of reason. I didn’t fan the flames. It was a way for us to come together and create unity and solidarity.","Romany Blythe doubled her money on a Islington townhouse bought in 2006 .

"By . Emma Innes . Most people believe sushi is a nutritious, low calorie meal, but new research suggests it could actually be bad for you. A study has revealed that people who regularly eat sushi could be at an increased risk of heart disease. The researchers, from Rutgers University, near New York, found that eating a lot of sushi can put people in danger of exposure to dangerous levels of mercury. A study has revealed that people who regularly eat sushi could be at an increased risk of heart disease . They say the fish contains methylmercury which can cause heart disease, problems with brain and nervous system development and decreased cognitive performance. The researchers, who published their findings in the Journal of Risk Research, also noted that methylmercury can counteract the positive effects of omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce cholesterol levels and lower the risk of some cancers, heart disease, blood pressure, stroke and premature birth. The scientists interviewed more than 1,200 people about their consumption of sushi and other fish products. The fish contains methylmercury which can cause heart disease, problems with brain and nervous system development and decreased cognitive performance . They also measured the mercury levels in sushi samples from across the U.S. They found that 92 per cent of people ate an average of five fish meals per month. The top 10 per cent of fish eaters exceeded the World Health Organisation’s recommended safe level of methylmercury consumption. Large tuna, such as the Atlantic Bluefin, were found to contain the highest levels of mercury. Eel, crab, salmon and kelp all have lower levels of methylmercury. Methylmercury can pass from a pregnant woman to her unborn child meaning the NHS recommends that mothers-to-be limit their intake of fish that are high in mercury. The NHS recommends that pregnant woman do not eat any shark, marlin or swordfish. It also says that they should limit the amount of tuna they have to two steaks, or four medium-sized cans, a week. The reason for this is that tuna contains high levels of mercury which can damage a baby's developing nervous system.","The mercury in fish can cause problems with nervous system development .

"By . Lydia Warren . and Anna Sanders . Parents of a 10-year-old cystic fibrosis sufferer who is too young to receive a life-saving transplant have asked the public directly to help save their daughter's life. Janet and Fran Murnaghan pleaded to the public in a statement Sunday for a lung donation from any family able to give it to their daughter Sarah. 'Essentially, Sarah has been left to die,' Sarah's parents said in the statement, according to the New York Daily News. Battle: Ten-year-old Sarah Murnaghan has been on the waiting list for a lung transplant for 18 months . The Murnaghans issued the call-to-arms after unsuccessful efforts by Health and Human . Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to help Sarah. Though Sebelius asked for the Organ Procurement and Transplantation . Network to review the policy on lung allocation in a letter Friday, according to The Associated Press, she did not override it. 'Secretary Sebelius' decision to not exercise her very clear authority under . the law to intervene and mandate a variance that would help save Sarah's life is . devastating,' Sarah's parents said in the statement according to the Daily News. Sarah, from Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, was born with cystic fibrosis and she now lives at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia as her lungs continue to deteriorate. She relies on a ventilator to breathe and has been on the waiting list for new lungs for 18 months - and is top of the priority list for children in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia . and northern Virginia. But so far, none have become available - and because she falls two years below the cut off for adult lungs, she can do nothing but wait. She has been given just three to five weeks to live. Celebration: Sarah and her mom Janet are celebrating after a federal judge overruled a law preventing children under 12 from receiving adult organs . Her parents learned just weeks ago that Sarah would be given a better chance if she were waiting for adult lungs, which are reserved for people aged 12 or over. If an adult's lung was modified, it would work perfectly, CNN reported. Instead she must wait for a child's lung, which are in much shorter supply; in 2012, there were just 10 transplants for Sarah's age group, but more than 1,700 for adults,  according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. Her mother called it 'insane'. 'It shouldn't be about their age,' she told CNN. 'If she's the sickest person, she should qualify.' Emotional: Before Wednesday's reprieve Mom Janet had said she refused to tell her young daughter just how sick she really is . Fears: Janet and Fran Murnaghan filed an emergency motion for the temporary restraining order on Wednesday morning, the day after U.S. health secretary Sebelius had turned down their appeals . The system determining who is allocated lungs for transplants was overhauled in 2004 and again in 2008. Doctors claim the changes have allowed fewer people on the waiting list to die. The changes meant that lung transplants are allocated by age groups. Those over the age of 12 are given an allocation score based on how urgently they need a transplant and the severity of their medical condition. Those who would benefit most are placed highest and given first priority. For children under 12, lungs are only allocated based on the time they've spent on the list. One problem is that there are few pediatric lungs available for transplant. In 2012, there were just 10 transplants for Sarah's age group, but more than 1,700 for adults,  according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. 'The law is, in my view, age discrimination,' she added to the Philadelphia Inquirer. 'I don't know if this is too late to make a difference for Sarah. But we'll keep fighting it.' Dr. Stuart Sweet from St. Louis Children's . Hospital, who helped write the pediatric transplant system, said the case 'tugs at his heart' but that no system is perfect. He said that if he changed the system for Sarah's advantage, 'there's . another patient, very likely an adolescent, who gets a disadvantage'. 'We've built a system that tries to be as fair to everyone as possible,' he contended. Her parents are hopeful that the issue can be beaten by someone stepping forward with a direct donation to Sarah. For now, they have decided not to tell Sarah, who is the eldest of four siblings, just how sick she is. 'I'm not going to tell her she's dying, because she's 10,' Janet told CNN. 'I'm going to tell her we're going to keep fighting. I don't want to scare her.' Support: Sarah, who has been living in hospital since February, is pictured with her three younger siblings . Sisterly: Despite her poor prognosis, Sarah remains upbeat about her chances of getting a transplant . Holding on: Sarah's mother said her eldest daughter has just three to five weeks left to live . Sarah, who has been outside just twice in the last 100 days, said that she misses school, where she could 'at least try and act like all the other normal children'. But even as her lungs deteriorate, the young girl remains positive, certain that she will beat her illness and be granted a lung transplant. 'We will [get them]!' she said. 'I can't wait to take my first breath with new lungs. I can close my eyes right now and imagine it... I'm never going to quit! Never, never!'","Parents of Sarah Murnaghan ask for help from any family who is able to provide a life-saving lung for their daughter .

"By . Steve Robson . Rail bosses have been forced to take action after confused tourists kept turning up at a railway station called Abbey Road expecting to find the famous Beatles zebra crossing. Transport for London decided to erect a tongue-in-cheek notice to inform baffled visitors that they've come to the wrong place. The genuine iconic crossing - which featured on the cover of The Beatles' album of the same name - is actually more than 10 miles away in the suburb of St Johns' Wood near the recording studios where it was recorded. Wrong direction: The Abbey Road in the East End is not quite as famous as its namesake in St John's Wood . Iconic: The cover of The Beatles 1969 album Abbey Road featuring the Fab Four . But local commuters say scores of hapless tourists regularly turn up at the East End station assuming it must be home to the famous Abbey Road. The gently mocking sign explains that . tourists who may have arrived expecting to find the famous crossing are . in the wrong place and explains how to get back  to the correct . location. Several of the . most famous Beatles songs including 'Daytripper', 'Help', 'Get Back' and 'Ticket to Ride' are cleverly weaved into the sign which has been placed . in the station entrance by one of the platforms. Light-hearted: Transport for London recently erected this sign in an effort to explain to confused tourists who arrive in the wrong place . Tourists who turned up asking locals . for directions expressed their amusement at the . sign yesterday - after getting over the initial disappointment at being at the . wrong station. Adrijana Maric, 30, who was visiting London from Bulgaria, said: 'It's pretty confusing. 'How is somebody who has never been to this country before know which one is which? 'I do like the sign though - it is very British humour.' While oversees IT student Nanja Alma, 21, added: 'It's the only Abbey Road on the tube map, so I just assumed it was here. 'I love the sign though, it kind of softens the blow of being 10 miles the wrong direction.' Local business owners did ask . Transport for London to change the name of the DLR station to put . an end to the confusion when it opened in 2011. Alex Lonsdale, 33, who lives . in West Ham, said: 'It's been quite annoying actually - the station is . always full of baffled tourists wandering around. 'I suppose you've got to laugh at it though and it looks like that is what Tfl have done. 'It makes a nice change to signs constantly telling you about engineering works, that's for sure.' Error: Some tourists have assumed that the Abbey Road DLR stop must be home of the famous studios and zebra crossing . Attraction: Tourists recreate the Beatles' album cover on the zebra crossing at Abbey Road in St John's Wood . A Transport for London spokesperson said: 'Some visitors to London have been taking the name of the DLR station as indicating the location of the Abbey Rd recording studio made famous by the Beatles and their album, Abbey Road. 'This poster displayed at the station will help them find their way to where they want to be. 'We hope the humour in it may help alleviate their dismay at finding themselves so far off course as they realise they are not the only ones to have made the mistake.'

"By . Vanessa Allen . Research found households registered with Telephone Preference Service receive double number of telemarketing calls as those that do not use it . It was designed to help people plagued with constant nuisance phone calls. But households signed up to the Telephone Preference Service still receive twice as many telemarketing calls as those who haven’t registered, research has found. More than eight in ten people received an unsolicited call last month, with 8 per cent receiving 50 or more. This means hundreds of thousands of homes receive more than 50 nuisance calls every month. Six out of ten householders say the unsolicited calls are so bad they no longer want to answer their own telephone. Many . of the calls turn out to be silent, which can be a worry for the . elderly left in fear that a burglar is checking if they are at home. Which? has now called for a change in the law to clamp down on the trade in personal data and stop the nuisance calls. A survey of 2,000 people by . the consumer group found that those registered with the TPS did report a . decrease in calls. But they still received an average of ten in the . past month, compared with five for those who had not signed up. The poll found six out of ten TPS users were not satisfied with the free opt-out service. The Which? research found that one in . three people felt intimidated by the unsolicited calls and 85 per cent . said the calls and text messages were an ‘annoying interruption’. UK companies making telemarketing calls are legally required to screen their calling lists against the TPS register. But firms outside the UK are not legally bound – and there have been warnings that some companies simply ignore the register. Companies calling about mis-sold Payment Protection Insurance and accident claim firms were the biggest nuisance, it was found. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd warned the nuisance calls had become a ‘scourge on people’s lives’. He said: ‘It’s outrageous that people are put off answering their phone for fear of getting another nuisance call. Which? called for change in the law to clampdown on calls and said it had become a 'scourge' on people's lives . 'The current system is failing the public and given the scale of this problem, it’s time for the Government to step in. '‘We urgently need to see a new approach, . new laws and new technology to tackle this scourge on people’s lives. People must be put back in control of their personal data.’ John Mitchison, head of the TPS, said: ‘TPS registration stops unsolicited calls from law-abiding companies that check names against the TPS’s “do not call” list. However, it can’t physically block calls from rogue companies that flout the law.’ Telemarketing firms buy personal information, including phone numbers, gathered from consumers who have filled in forms and given permission to be sent marketing material from third parties. Such information can then be sold on to an unlimited number of companies, for an unlimited time. Which? said it wanted a time limit such as six months to be imposed on companies contacting consumers. The watchdog also wants the introduction of a register where consumers can check who holds their data and who is selling it on. Under the register scheme, firms would have to prove that a consumer had consented to their data being passed on. Which? has asked the Information Commissioner’s Office, the Ministry of Justice, regulator Ofcom and the Office of Fair Trading to form a joint taskforce to tackle the problem of nuisance calls. It said the Government needed to take a tougher approach on the use of personal data, and to give regulators greater powers to enforce the law and hit the culprits with heavy fines. An Ofcom spokesman said it had issued fines of more than £1.5million against firms which had broken the rules on silent calls in the last year. He said: ‘We take this issue extremely seriously. Ofcom and the telecoms industry is already working closely together to help trace companies behind nuisance calls.’","Households registered with Telephone Preference Service receive double number of calls .

"By . Ryan Gorman . The five recently released Taliban prisoners currently living in Doha have been afforded many luxuries, it has been revealed. A DailyBeast reporter attending a conference in the capital Doha made the discovery while trying to track the Taliban Five down. The former Guantanamo Bay detainees were ultimately not found, but much was found out about their quality of life. The men went from living in a military prison to a gated luxury compound on the outskirts of town after their exchange earlier this month for U.S. Army prisoner of war Bowe Bergdahl. Life of luxury: The Taliban Afghanistan Political Office in Doha, pictured June 18, 2013, is in a building similar to where the five terror suspects released from Guantanamo Bay are living, it has been revealed . In the time since they have been released, the former terror suspects have had ‘freedom of movement within Qatar,’ the Daily Beast noted, but have been ‘intentionally avoiding contact with the media.’ This is in stark contrast to the locked-down, under supervision at all times speculations that were rampant at the time Bergdahl was released. They are also living in a mansion in the al-Muaither neighborhood, ‘ loose conglomeration of modest houses and high-end compounds littered with expensive cars,’ the site observed. Daily Beast reporter Josh Steinberg ended up in the desert-side area after unsuccessfully trying to track the men down through officials and intelligence analysts at the U.S. - Muslim relations conference he was attending. Home cooking: The Afghan Brothers Restaurant in Doha, Qatar, is one place the former detainees may frequent or have food delivered from . Hitting mostly dead ends, he eventually was able to find out the terror conspirators have a masseuse a conference-goer had spoken with. 'It didn’t seem to fit with their hard-line stereotypes,' wrote Steinberg. The masseur could not be tracked down, nor could a senior Obama Administration official who knew exactly where the men were staying. An Afghan restaurant in the area also denied having delivered any food to them. An attempt to approach the Taliban representative office in Doha was met with an angry cop and the reporter jumping into a moving car to escape possible arrest.","The former prisoners now live relatively free and move around Qatar unabated .

"By . Associated Press . Pope Francis journeyed Saturday to the heart of Italy's biggest crime syndicate in southern Calabria, met the father of a three-year-old boy slain in the region's drug war, and declared that all mobsters are automatically excommunicated from the Catholic Church. During his one-day pilgrimage, Francis comforted the imprisoned father of Nicola Campolongo in the courtyard of a prison in the town of Castrovillari.

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Cheating death: Professional diver Chris Lemons . A deep sea diver cheated death when he survived under water for almost 40 minutes after his air supply ran out. Chris Lemons was working 262 feet under water in the freezing North Sea when his lifeline of air and heat was severed, leaving him with just his oxygen tank. The professional diver remained perfectly still to conserve his energy but lost consciousness when the air supply from his emergency oxygen tank ran out. He was not discovered until 38 minutes later when his colleagues dragged him to safety of a diving bell. His workmates feared the worst when they pulled his blue, lifeless and freezing cold body on board. However - astonishingly - he regained . consciousness after only two breaths of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation . and has since made a full recovery, The Times reported. The 32-year-old's amazing story . survival has stunned the diving community, who have praised his . remarkably calm actions in internet chat rooms. According to The Times, a fellow diver wrote in an online forum: 'Chris, the diver in . question, said he knew to try and conserve his gas even though he was . freezing to death. He doesn't remember slipping into unconsciousness, it . just happened. 'After . two breaths by the bellman he started breathing on his own, he even . stood up and out the way on his own steam to help in getting the bottom . door down. Remarkable recovery: This graphic explains how the accident happened deep under the oil rig . 'Once his . breathing was restored he recovered quite quickly, so they proceeded to . start and warm him once the door was down and the bell was on its way . up. (He was blue when they removed his hat). 'Chris has been very very very lucky. It brings it home just how quickly things can go pear-shaped.' The . drama unfolded last Tuesday when Mr Lemons, from Mallaig in the . Scottish Highlands, made his underwater descent attached to a support . vessel belonging to his employers, Bibby Offshore. He . had been inspecting a rig drilling structure at the Huntington oil . field, 115 miles . east of Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, when his 'umbilical cord' lifeline of . air and heat - crucial for working in very cold water - was snagged and . severed at 10.10pm. Two minutes later all communication was lost with Mr Lemons as his main oxygen supply was cut off, leaving with his emergency tank which, experts believe, would have given him 10 minutes of air at the most. Astonishing survival: Chris Lemons conserved his energy and used his emergency oxygen tank when his air supply was severed (file picture) Occupational hazard: Mr Lemons is a professional diver working from an oil rig in the North Sea (pictured) While another . diver made it to the safety of a diving bell, an air-tight chamber used to transport divers to underwater depths, Mr Lemons displayed . extraordinary calm and followed safety procedure by sitting very still . on top of the oil rig drill and using his emergency oxygen tank while he . waited for help to arrive. By 10.17pm, the diver's beacon - a . safety signal - was located in the spot where Mr Lemons had been working . on the drill and a remotely operated search vehicle is launched. 'This is one of the most remarkable stories I have heard, not only because of his survival but his rapid recovery' Oliver Firth, Medical Director of the London Diving Chamber . The other diver retrieved Mr Lemon's . body and pulled him to the diving bell. When colleagues removed his . helmet he was unconscious, blue and very cold. However, . after only two resuscitating breaths from the bellman - the name given . to the diver on the diving bell - he regained consciousness. He eventually re-surfaced at 10.48pm, where he was immediately transported to receive decompression care. After undergoing treatment in a decompression chamber in Aberdeen, Mr Lemons has since made a complete recovery. Both the other diver and the bellman have made recoveries after undergoing decompression treatment in Aberdeen. Bibby . Offshore, Mr Lemons' employer which was operating the support vessel he . was attached to, praised the 'skill, professionalism and expertise' of . the rescue crew. Following procedure: Mr Lemons' actions have been praised by the diving community (file picture) A diving medical expert today claimed the cold temperatures of the North Sea might have helped save Chris Lemons. The freezing water could have activated his diving reflex which would have slowed his heart and . optimised his respiration while under water. Oliver Firth, medical director of the . London Diving Chamber, said: 'It's staggering that he survived. He . should be dead at that sort of depth. 'It's incredible that he had the . presence of mind to stay calm and not try and get to the surface in a . panic, as panicking leads to death in this sort of instance. 'The interesting thing here is that . it happened in very cold water. It sounds like the diving reflex might . have played a part in this. 'When very cold water touches . our faces, the reflex is activated and it's . designed to protect our bodies by slowing the heart down . and optimising respiration while under water. 'Animals have it too, but it's much . stronger, which is why seals and other mammals can stay under water for . long periods of time. 'If his umbilical cord was severed, I . assume his helmet would have filled with water which might have hit . chemical receptors on certain areas of the face, such as the forehead. This might have activated the reflex. It's a protective response. 'He would have had maybe 10 litres of . air in his emergency oxygen tank which, at that depth, would not have . lasted very long - maybe eight to 10 minutes.

Mr Parker made the donation to honour his late father, Major Horace Parker, who was a fan of the museum. The 100 etchings are known as the Vollard Suite because they were commissioned by Paris art dealer and print publisher Ambroise Vollard, who gave Picasso a Renoir and a Cezanne painting in exchange for the work. Vollard gave the Spanish artist his first Paris exhibition in 1901. But Vollard's death in a car accident, followed by the outbreak of the Second World War, delayed the release of the prints. Dealer Henri Petiet purchased most of the prints from the Vollard estate. The British Museum's set has been acquired from the heirs of Petiet, following a donation by the Hamish Parker Charitable Trust . The museum already had seven etchings from the Vollard Suite, acquired in 1979. The donation came about after the curator said at an event that it was his 'long-term ambition' to have the complete set. 'Little did I know that I had dropped a seed in Hamish Parker's head', Mr Coppel said. A museum assistant poses with some of the etchings by Pablo Picasso at the British Museum in London .

The email said: 'I'm making this donation in memory of my father who passed away this year. 'Although it might be going too far to suggest that he was a fan of Picasso, he certainly was a fan of the British museum and anything that involves enlightenment... to have this set so close to the Elgin Marbles would be of particular delight to him.'

"By . Ruth Styles . Meet Louisa Bull - the UK's youngest female sumo wrestler who takes on women more than twice her size. Fifteen-year-old Louisa is already the British female 80 kilos (12.5st) champion weighing in at 11st. And the 5ft 9in teen is so fearless she takes boys - and 25st female sumos in competition. Louisa, from Derby, said: 'People don't believe me at first when I tell them I'm a sumo wrestler because they think sumos have to be massive and extremely strong.' Daddy's girl: Louisa learned sumo from her father and the two share a passion for the sport, although neither will give an inch . Normal: When Louisa isn't wrestling, she likes to do all the things the average teenage girl does . 'And when I first started sumo I had a lot of boys saying I wasn't going to get anywhere because I was a girl. 'But I took them on in the sumo ring and sometimes I beat them - so they're not as sure of themselves any more. She added: 'I think a lot of people think sumo is just about two fat guys pushing each other out of the ring. 'My friends and the boys at school also used to think it was weird and they'd make a few jokes about it but now they think it's great and I even teach them moves.' She admits she's come away from some fights with twisted ankles and even a bloody nose but the GSCE student says she's just like any other girl. She added: 'I like to wear make-up and lots of bright and pretty clothes - even though I like to beat people up, I still like to look good. 'If I've not got my training clothes on I'm just a normal girl with a bit of an edge.' Record: Schoolgirl Louisa is the UK's youngest ever sumo wrestler, although that hasn't stopped her winning . Tough: Louisa's coach says she's stronger than most of the boys she goes head to head with . Travel: Louisa would like to go to Japan to meet the country's professional wrestlers . Family affair: Louisa's father Martin (left) is also a sumo wrestler and loves watching his daughter in action . Like other forms of wrestling, winning a Sumo bout requires one wrestler (rikishi) to force another out of a circular ring (dohyō) or to touch the ground with anything other than the soles of the feet. The sport originated in Japan, which remains the only country where sumo has a professional body and fighters can be paid for their efforts. Louisa, the eldest of five children, had her first taste of fighting sports at just six years old after watching dad, Martin, 35, who is a keen boxer as well as a sumo wrestler. By the age of 13 she had started at a local sumo gym, run by Steve Pateman, founder of the British Sumo Federation. Now she trains there three times a week for competitions and has to eat a strict 2,000 calorie diet with plenty of protein. She can lift up to 50 kilo weights and has even started fighting Martin, a project management consultant, in practice contests. She said: 'It doesn't frighten me when I'm up against someone who's bigger. I tell myself that I can do it and if I just go in there and try my best, I might be able to win.' Louisa become so strong she can lift her dad, who competes in the 70 kilos category, above her head. But Martin has taken it all on the chin and says he and his wife, Victoria, 34, are proud of their daughter's achievements. He said: 'I think it's good that women should learn a martial art or a self-defense so they can keep fit and look after themselves. 'Louisa makes a good sumo wrestler because she's very stubborn and she's extremely strong for her age. She also likes the challenge of it.' Winner: So good is Louisa, she regularly trounces wrestlers who weigh more than twice what she does . Full-time mum Victoria, 34, added: 'I think any mother would be worried about their daughter wrestling. 'She broke her nose once and I went in to panic. It's heartbreaking when she gets hurt but I'm always there to support her. I'm on hand to bandage her up and mend the injuries. 'It is nerve racking but she's got good supportive people around her who we trust.' Louisa travelled to Barcis, Italy, for the European Sumo Championships last year - where competed in an open-weight category. She faced a 25-stone competitor but, incredibly, that didn't faze her and she's returning this year. Coach Steve even has hopes that she will eventually travel to the home of Sumo in Tokyo, Japan. He said: 'Louisa is actually stronger than most of the boys. When she fought them and won I knew she'd be a champion. She's getting stronger each week.' Louisa added: 'Sumo wrestling is such a different sport and it's so enjoyable. Those who say girls can't be sumo wrestlers are talking rubbish. 'At the moment, there's hardly any girls in sumo wrestling but it would be awesome if more would join and I hope that I can inspire more to do it.'

"By . Sophie Borland . Painkillers taken by millions of Britons may be causing heart attacks, strokes and early death because they contain so much salt, a major study shows. Patients who regularly take soluble forms of aspirin, paracetamol, ibuprofen and other common drugs are 22 per cent more at risk of stroke and seven times more prone to high blood pressure, the researchers found. They were also found to be 28 per cent more likely to die early. Recommended doses of some of the painkillers were found to contain 50 per cent more salt than the safe daily limits for adults. Soluble painkillers taken by million of Britons could be causing early death due to the amount of salt they contain, research shows . The researchers behind the study, carried out by University College London and the University of Dundee, are now warning patients to avoid regularly taking soluble painkillers. And they are urging drugs firms to print labels similar to those on food packaging on the tablets – most of which are sold over the counter – warning patients about high levels of salt. Millions of adults, particularly the elderly, rely on painkillers for long-term conditions such as arthritis, while supplements such as calcium are commonly taken by pregnant women and those going through the menopause. Many prefer taking the soluble varieties as they are easier to swallow and are thought to get to work more quickly as they have already been broken down. But the medicines contain very high levels of salt as it helps them dissolve in water and produce a fizzing effect. During the study, academics monitored patients who had been prescribed  soluble forms of paracetamol, aspirin and ibuprofen as well as supplements such as vitamin D, zinc and calcium for an average of seven years. They trawled 1.29million patient records obtained from GP surgeries across the UK. Those taking the soluble pills for any length of time were 16 per cent more likely to suffer a heart attack, stroke or die early. They also found that patients were 22 per cent more likely to suffer a stroke, 28 per cent more likely to die from any cause and seven times more likely to suffer high blood pressure. On average, patients succumbed to these problems only four years after first being prescribed the drugs. Certain painkillers were found to contain 50 per cent more salt than the safe daily limit . Government guidelines state that adults should eat no more than six grams of salt a day. Patients taking eight soluble paracetamol pills a day – the full daily dose – exceed this amount by 50 per cent. The average adult eats about eight grams of salt a day, but experts calculate that if we all reduced that by three grams there would be 30,000 fewer heart attacks and strokes a year. By comparison a packet of ready salted crisps contains half a gram of salt, while a packet of salt and vinegar has one gram. A bowl of cornflakes – the saltiest cereal – contains around 0.4 grams, while two slices of bread have about 0.8 grams. The worst culprits are ready meals, which can contain seven grams per portion, and some ready-made sandwiches, which contain between three and four grams. Professor Thomas Macdonald, of the University of Dundee, said: ‘We were surprised at how much salt there was in some tablets. Researchers behind the study are now urging people not to take soluble painkillers on a regular basis (library image) ‘All the foods we buy we can find out in intricate detail how much sodium (salt) there is but we can’t do that with medicines.’ He added: ‘It’s an avoidable risk and it’s a cardiovascular risk which is the commonest cause of death in Britain. If you take these drugs every day it would be better for your health to take the normal versions, not the soluble ones.’ The researchers only looked at patients prescribed the pills by their GP but they said millions of adults who buy them over the counter were also at risk. Dr Jacob George, also from the University of Dundee, said: ‘These drugs are also available over the counter, they can be picked up in the supermarket. ‘We have no control over how many millions of people are buying these drugs. Heart disease, which includes heart attacks and strokes, is by far the biggest killer in Britain. It claims 180,000 lives a year. Experts pointed out that patients taking the pills occasionally were probably not damaging their health. Dr Mike Knapton, Associate Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘We know that too much salt is linked to a higher risk of heart attack and stroke. ‘It’s important to remember that this research applies to people who are taking these medicines every day – this does not mean that occasional use could damage your heart health. ‘To give us an idea of whether these risks translate for medicines bought over the counter, we would need to see further research focusing on non-prescription medication.’ ‘This is an important reminder for doctors and patients to carefully consider the risks and benefits of soluble or effervescent (fizzing) medicines at the time of prescription.’ Dr Li Wei, an expert in statistics who specialises in drugs safety at University College London’s School of Pharmacy, was also highly involved in the study.","Millions of Britons could be at risk of early death due to painkillers .

Thieves broke into the home in January 2012 and stole £50,000 worth of lead from the roof. It was the last straw for Mr Somerset who described the property as a 'white elephant' and put it on the market with Strutt and Parker estate agents in March 2013. He lives in a small flat in a restored section at the top of the property which cost more than £100,000 to bring up to scratch. Although the property was listed for £500,000, it has been snapped up for in excess of £700,000 after strong interest from potential buyers. Damage: The leaky domed roof which has some smashed panels of glass. Underneath, the plaster has been damaged. It will cost thousands of pounds to have it brought up to standard . Run down: This stairwell will need repairs - or possibly to be removed altogether - when the new owner carries out improvement work . Sweeping staircase: This ornate wooden staircase lies at the heart of the property. But unfortunately the property needs £2m worth of repairs . Disrepair: Cracked and damaged plasterwork can be seen at the top of the staircase . The property features an ornate glass . dome that leaks because several of the panes are broken - and a grand oak . stairway has had to be supported with a series of iron rods. A large number of the floorboards have rotted completely and will have to be torn out and replaced. As the building is listed, however, traditional methods will have to be used to repair the property, adding to the already hefty bill the new owner will face. Mr Somerset has exchanged contracts with the buyers although the deal is yet to be formally completed. Grand: The property, built for around £90,000 in 1797, has been in the hands of the Somerset family since 1845 . The front of the property was designed to look like the grand Arundel Castle, six miles away, with a clock tower . and turrets. From behind it is a Greco-Palladian mansion with grand formal columns. But the property's unusual design is its very undoing with windows bricked over inside - and doors that go nowhere at all. Mr Somerset's father Fitzroy was forced . to leave the property in 1941 when it was requisitioned by the Canadian . Army. When he got it back four years later it was in a severe state of . disrepair. A spokesman from English Heritage said: 'We are looking forward to working with the new owners. 'We need to bring this tremendously important building back into good repair.' Beautiful: Grand pillars and a wonderfully-restored fireplace, this is one of the better rooms in the property. Many of the floorboards have rotted and need replacing . Restored: A modern fitted kitchen at the top of the property. Mr Somerset had it partially restored at a cost of more than £100,000 - but doesn't have the finances or the expertise to do the rest of the castle . Inner beauty: With high ceilings, grand columns, ornate plasterwork and wonderful views this property has enormous potential . Well-restored: Although part of the property has been repaired, these pictures are unrepresentative of the general dilapidated state of the building . Beautiful view: The grounds as seen from the rear of the property near Worthing, West Sussex.

"By . Associated Press . Updated: . 09:34 EST, 1 September 2011 . Vines creep across Tomioka's empty streets, its prim gardens overgrown with waist-high weeds and meadow flowers. Dead cows rot where they were left to starve in their pens. Chicken coops writhe with maggots, a sickening stench hanging in the air. This once-thriving community of 16,000 people now has a population of one. Companions: Naoto Matsumura is thought to be the only resident left in the town Tomioka which is located near the doomed nuclear power plant Fukushima . In this nuclear no-man's land poisoned by radiation from a disaster-battered power plant, rice farmer Naoto Matsumura refuses to leave despite government orders. He says he has thought about the possibility of getting cancer but prefers to stay – with a skinny dog named Aki his constant companion. Nearly six months after Japan's catastrophic earthquake and tsunami, the 53-year-old believes he is the only inhabitant left in this town sandwiched between the doomed Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power station to the north and another sprawling nuclear plant to the south. 'If I give up and leave, it's all . over,' he told The Associated Press. 'It's my responsibility to stay. And it is my right to be here.'Matsumura is an anomaly in a country where defiance of the government is rare and social consensus counts above everything else. Yet, Matsumura's quiet civil disobedience speaks loudly of the dilemma . facing the more than 100,000 silent 'nuclear refugees' who were . displaced by the March 11 disaster. Tokyo was quick to establish . evacuation zones around the plant but has been slow to settle the . refugees. Alone: Matsumura looks after the town's abandoned animals and said he has a responsibility and a right to stay in the town . A government order forbids them from going back to their homes . in a half dozen towns around Fukushima Dai-ichi that were declared . off-limits after the tsunami-stricken nuclear plant started spewing . radioactivity. 'We are already being forgotten,' said . Matsumura, a leathery but clean-cut man with the sturdy build of a . farmer. 'The rest of the country has moved on. They don't want to think . about us.' Tomioka's city . hall has been moved to a safer city in Fukushima prefecture, where . thousands of its residents live in makeshift shelters. Thousands more . have scattered across the country. The . town itself is sealed behind police barriers, which hide the heart of . the nuclear no-go zone, an area that is officially too dangerous for . human habitation. Officers are sent into Tomioka each . day to search for burglars or violators of the keep-out order. By law, . anyone caught inside the zone can be detained and fined. But authorities mostly turn a blind . eye to Matsumura, though he says he has been confronted by the police a . few times. If there are other holdouts, they have escaped detection. 'Some people stayed behind, some . stayed with me in my house,' he said. 'But the last one left a few weeks . ago. He asked me to take care of his cats.' Tomioka . official Tomio Midorikawa, who is in charge of the town's living and . environment division, said the last resident was persuaded to leave in . early August – the same time Matsumura claims his neighbour left. He was . not aware of Matsumura. Abandoned: Vines creep across the town's empty streets, and its prim gardens are overgrown with waist-high weeds . Without . electricity or running water, Matsumura fires up a pair of old . generators each night and draws his water from a local well. He eats . mostly canned foods, or fish that he catches himself in a nearby river. He said that once or twice a month, . he makes his way to a city outside the zone in his mini pickup truck to . stock up on supplies and gas. He has taken it upon himself to tend to the town's abandoned cats and dogs, including the wolflike Aki.'I've . gone to Tokyo a couple of times to tell the politicians why I'm here,' he said. 'I tell them that it was an outrage how the cows were left to . die, and how important it is for someone to tend to the family graves. They don't seem to hear me. They just tell me I shouldn't be here to . begin with.' Matsumura said he did leave once, but the ensuing experience only strengthened his desire to return. 'I drove to a relative's house . thinking I would stay there,' he said. 'But she wouldn't let me in the . door, she was too afraid I was contaminated. Then I went to an . evacuation centre, but it was full. That was enough to convince me to . come home.' The tsunami . disaster left nearly 21,000 people dead or missing and touched off . fires, explosions and meltdowns at the Fukushima nuclear plant. The . amount of radioactive cesium released into the environment since has . been estimated to be equal to 168 Hiroshimas, making it the worst atomic . disaster since Chernobyl. No one – including Matsumura – is . suggesting the exclusion zone be lifted altogether. The connection . between radiation and cancer or other health problems is well . established, and experts agree it could be decades until the nuclear . zone is safe. Ghost town: Matsumura saws a fallen tree as it blocks a mountain road in the town near Fukishima . Some point to the example of Chernobyl, which 25 years later is still mostly void of human life. 'The . contaminants will be there for decades, centuries, millennia,' said . Timothy Mousseau, a biologist with the University of South Carolina who . has studied Chernobyl for more than a decade and recently returned from a . preliminary research trip to Fukushima. Even so, local authorities are increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress toward resolving the nuclear Diaspora. Tamotsu Baba, the mayor of Namie, a . partially evacuated town near Tomioka, said in an interview it was . reasonable at first for Tokyo to establish a geometric ring extending . outward from the center of the plant. But . he believes data collected since should be used to fine-tune the . exclusion area to reflect the actual amounts of contamination.'We . have invested millions in developing a system to measure radiation,' he . said. 'But it is like the whole thing is being decided by someone . behind a desk with a 500 yen compass.' Further . fanning the anger among the displaced, compensation from the government . and Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility that runs the plant, has . stalled in a bureaucratic labyrinth. Before the crisis began, the average annual income in Tomioka was about 3.5 million yen ($28,000). Desolate: The once well kept houses are overgrown and abandoned . Matsumura said he has received about 1 million yen (£8,000) in compensation, far less than he would have earned from selling his rice and other produce. TEPCO, reeling financially from the accident, has put off a final decision on further compensation until the plant is stabilized. The money already handed out will be subtracted from the amount it eventually settles on. Officials say some restrictions may be lifted by the end of the year if the Fukushima reactors are brought to a stable shutdown. Beyond that, the future remains a mystery.'There are many tasks ahead before we will be able to return to our town, including decontamination and the rebuilding of our sewage system, roads and infrastructure,' Tomioka Mayor Katsuya Endo said in a recent post on the town's website. 'But we must maintain our hope, and gradually move forward.' Matsumura now likens himself to the Japanese soldiers who refused to surrender until decades after the end of World War II. As a heavy rain began to fall, he walked down an overgrown mountain path to his rice paddy. He pulled up a plant by its roots, twisted it between his fingers then tossed it into an irrigation ditch with a resigned sigh. There will be no cash crop this year. Or maybe ever again. 'It was strange being alone at first, but I am resolved to stay,' he said. 'I'm getting used to this life.'","The town situated near the doomed .

"By . Associated Press . A woman who dressed as a nurse and . abducted a three-day-old boy from a Pittsburgh hospital in a handbag was . sentenced today to up to five years in prison. 'All I wanted to do was love someone,' Breona Moore told the Allegheny County judge who sentenced her in Pennsylvania. She was also given ten years' probation. Moore, 21, of East McKeesport, told friends . for weeks that she was pregnant and had given birth before buying . $16 hospital scrubs and pretending to be a nurse at Magee-Womens Hospital of . UPMC in August 2012, prosecutors said. Breona Moore, 21, was sentenced to up to five years in prison after she posed as a nurse and stole a baby from a Pennsylvania hospital in 2012 . Safe: Bryce Coleman was found safe five hours after he was stolen from his mother in the hospital in 2012 . Moore . was able to take three-day-old Bryce Coleman by entering the mother's room and telling her . the child needed to be taken for a medical test, authorities said. Moore . was 5-foot-4 and 230 pounds, but relatives doubted the pregnancy and . called police when they heard about the kidnapping on the news. Police . found Moore hiding in the closet of a downtown office building a few . hours later, holding the baby. The baby wasn't harmed. Moore . had pleaded guilty to the charges in April. Defense attorney Blaine . Jones said Moore was 'remorseful' and 'taking ownership' of her crimes. Deputy District Attorney Janet Necessary argued for prison, despite Moore's somewhat pathetic circumstances. 'This was not an impulse or spur-of-the-moment thing,' Necessary said. 'The defendant made a detailed plan.' Moore . told the judge she became depressed after a doctor told her she'd be . unable to have children. She apologized for her actions, and to the . baby's mother, who wasn't in the courtroom. 'I hope I will be as blessed as you some day,' Moore said. 'There are no words to say how remorseful I am.' Moore pictured in 2012 as she was arrested. She told the court today that she took the baby because she wanted someone to love . At the time of her arrest, Moore . smiled broadly for TV cameras and blamed her mother, father and . boyfriend for the kidnapping as she was led away in handcuffs. Moore . had the newborn for about five hours after the kidnapping, which set . off a frantic search by police and the staff at Magee-Womens Hospital. He was found safe when police discovered Moore hiding in a stair well in . an office building near the hospital. Authorities say Moore walked into a uniform shop across the street from the hospital the day she kidnapped the boy and purchased a black nurse scrub top with the hospital's logo on it. The top was priced at $17.99, but she claimed she worked at the hospital and received a 10-percent discount. Her final price for the nurse's uniform -- $16.19, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Disguised as a nurse, Moore walked into the hospital and wandered the halls, before finding Rhonda King, 27, in her hospital room with Bryce, her newborn son. 'She said she was taking the baby to get a checkup, that she would bring the baby right back,' Thelma Broughton, Bryce's grandmother, told the Post-Gazette at the time. Ms King willingly handed over the infant, believing Moore was a nurse. 'But she never came back,' Ms Broughton said. Bryce is Ms King's fifth child. Authorities said Moore walked around the hospital with the child for 15 to 30 minutes before cutting off the infant's radio monitor tag and walking out the door with him. When Bryce was not returned to Ms King, she called hospital staff, who realize the infant had been taken. Police . found the child after Moore's family called detectives and said they . feared she may have taken the child.  Moore's parents said she claimed . that she was pregnant and became enraged when no one believed her.  Police believe she might have stolen the child to prove to them that she was pregnant. Recovered: Three-day-old Bryce Coleman is carried to an ambulance by a Pittsburgh Police Officer and was later returned to his mother in 2012 .","Breona Moore posed as a nurse and stole newborn Bryce Coleman from a Pittsburgh hospital in 2012 .

"By . Rob Waugh . The skeleton of a bushy-tailed baby dinosaur that roamed Earth 135 million years ago has been found in Europe. The creature had little 'fuzzy' feathers, almost like hairs. Named Sciurumimus after the tree squirrel species Sciurus, it is the best preserved dinosaur remains ever discovered in Europe. At just 72 cms (28 inches) long, the fanged predator looks like a tiny T-Rex. It is believed to have been a year-old hatchling and had a large skull, short hind limbs and smooth skin. Bushy-tailed: The 135million-year-old fossil of this dinosaur, named the Sciurumimus, has been discovered in Germany. It measures just 72cms long and is believed to have been a hatchling . Its vivid compression with mouth wide open also bears the outline of sharp, serrated little teeth and primitive fuzzy feathers that are more akin to hair. These were over its front, below the belly, and back as well as the tail, suggesting the animal's whole body could have been covered in feathers. It is impossible to say exactly what killed the animal, but it has been speculated that it may have drowned. Previously reported fossils of feathered killer dinosaurs belonged to a group called coelurosaurs that are closely related to birds and from which T Rex and other meat-eating beasts evolved. But Sciurumimus albersdoerferi - dug up out of limestone rock at a quarry near Kelheim in Bavaria, southern Germany, in 2009 - was a megalosauroid which were members of the theropods. Dr Oliver Rauhut said: ‘Here we report an exceptionally preserved skeleton of a juvenile megalosauroid, Sciurumimus albersdoerferi, from the Late Jurassic of Germany, which preserves a filamentous plumage at the tail base and on parts of the body. ‘The specimen is preserved in complete articulation, lying on its right side.’ Fossils of theropods - which include T Rex - are rare and usually fragmented. The best T Rex specimens are about 80 percent preserved whereas Sciurumimus is about 98 percent intact. Dr Rauhut, curator of the Bavarian Paleontological and Geological Collections (BSPG) in Munich, led an international team that examined the animal. He said: ‘This is one of the most complete dinosaur skeletons ever found worldwide. When I first saw it, it was hard to believe it was real because it was so well preserved. ‘It looked as if it had been made by someone to hang in their living room. But tests quickly showed it was genuine.’ He said the find was of ‘outstanding scientific importance’ because of the completeness of the skeleton, the presence of hair-like filamentous structures and its youth. Dr Rauhut said: ‘It is very difficult to say how large the animal would have grown to as an adult. One can't rule out it would have been up to eight or nine metres long but it could also have just been two or three metres.’ The large size of the skull in proportion to the rest of the body was a sure sign it had been very young when it died, he said. Examinations of juvenile theropods can help shed light on the mechanisms of evolution because recent research indicates changes in the processes of growing played an important role in how creatures evolved. The bones of the theropod are even better preserved than those of feathered dinosaurs found in China in the 1990s. Those are the only ones which are similarly complete, but they are millions of years younger, saud the researchers whose findings are published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Dr Rauhut said: ‘The great thing about this discovery is the preservation of the bones. Similarly complete skeletons were found in China of feathered dinosaurs. ‘They look great from afar but if you study them under the microscope, you can see that the bone preservation isn't that great.’ Hair on dinosaurs has been a focus of research because it could have developed into the feathers that were first detected on fossils of Archaeopteryx, the oldest known bird, which were found in Germany in the 19th century. That discovery suggested dinosaurs may have evolved into birds. Dr Rauhut said: ‘This new theropod is probably the most significant fossil found on German soil since the discoveries of the original bird Archaeopteryx.’","135million-year-old fossil discovered in Bavarian region of Germany .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . 'Sadist': Radoslaw Czerkawski, 32, an undocumented immigrant from . Poland, charged with 12 counts of animal abuse and one of misleading police in the brutal torture of a dog . An undocumented immigrant from Poland faces decades behind bars for allegedly torturing and leaving for dead a tiny pit bull dubbed 'Puppy Doe' in August. A jury yesterday indicted Radoslaw Czerkawski, 32, of 12 counts of animal abuse and one count of misleading police, with an arraignment expected to be set before December 20. The indictments move the existing case from the Quincy District Court, where criminal complaints only carry a maximum sentence of two and half years in a county House of Correction, to the Norfolk Superior Court. Prosecutors said Czerkawski obtained the dog free of charge on Craigslist and spent weeks brutally abusing her before dumping the tormented puppy in a Quincy park. The pet later had to be put down due to the severity of her injuries. The two-year-old pooch reportedly was stabbed in the eye, burned, had her limbs pulled from the joints and had her tongue sliced in half like a serpent. It was described as 'medieval' torture. 'I just want to know so bad why he did it. Why her, of all dogs? What did she ever do to him to make him want to hurt her so bad? She loved everybody,' Puppy Doe's former owner Laura Hankins told the Boston Herald. Investigators said they found Puppy Doe's blood in the second-floor Quincy, Massachusetts residence where the  illegal immigrant was living. According to prosecutors, Czerkawski worked as a home attendant, caring for a 95-year-old Polish dementia patient woman in Quincy, Boston Herald reported. Police say Czerkaswki left Puppy Doe in the park a day after his client passed away. Her death certificate stated that the woman died from 'failure to thrive' caused by her illness. Authorities do not believe that Czerkaswki had anything to do with the woman’s passing. Caught: Radoslaw Czerkawski was initially held on a fugitive from justice . charge in New Britain, Connecticut . When asked during a press conference . in October about a motive behind the sadistic animal abuse, Quincy Police . Chief Paul Keenan said: ‘Who has a motive for something like this? He's . probably just a sick individual.’ Following . Czerkaswki’s arrest in New Britain, Connecticut, Sunday, police in New . Bedford, Massachusetts, announced that the man was a suspect in . the theft of about $6,700 from a local church, South Coast Today said. Czerkawski . is accused of stealing and cashing 11 checks from St Lawrence the . Martyr Church, where he had stayed between January and April 2012 after . telling the pastor there that he wanted to become a priest. A month after he left for Canada, the church noticed that three of its accounts were missing about $6,700. Czerkawski, . a native of Hrubieszow, Poland, has been staying in the U.S. on a . tourist visa that had expired, according to The Patriot Ledger. Cruel: This two-year-old pit bull was found with horrific injuries . In . addition to the Puppy Doe charges, he is expected to face 11 counts of . larceny by check over $250 and a single count of larceny in a building . in connection to the New Bedford case. Police found Czerkawski at a La Quinta hotel before he appeared in New Britain Superior Court  to start the rendition process back to Massachusetts. The two-month investigation before Czerkawski was nabbed sparked outrage among dog lovers from coast to coast. During his Czerkawski's arraignment last month, . animal activists filled the Quincy courtroom to support Puppy Doe. Outraged dog owners and their four-legged friends also waited outside . the courthouse. 'She . didn’t deserve what she got. We’re definitely here with our puppies to . support her,' dog owner Kelly Duncan told WBZ NewsRadio 1030. Abused: Puppy Doe weighed only 18lb and had been stabbed, burned and tortured . Cops . had spent weeks following the trail of people who have owned the dog, . which had been given away at least once on Craigslist’s animal-adoption . pages by a woman who owned the dog last year. Police . and much of the public had been on the hunt for the suspect since the . female pit bull was found on August 31st close to a local playground. Quincy, . Massachusetts Police, the Animal Rescue League of Boston and the Office . of the District Attorney for the Norfolk District in Massachusetts had been investigating. 'Please . be assured that these three agencies are working in concert to identify . and hold accountable the person or persons responsible for the torture . of Puppy Doe,' Norfolk District Attorney . Michael Morrissey said in a statement. 'It is highly unlikely that this level of sadistic cruelty . could be shown to one animal and not be part of a pattern involving . other animals or perhaps vulnerable people.' Animal . rescue workers described the pit bull's injuries as the worst . they had ever seen. Veterinarians . at the Animal Rescue League of Boston who treated the dog said that she . was emaciated and weighed half of what would be expected for a two-year-old. Sweet natured: Despite having broken bones, crushed vertebrae and other injuries, the pit bull was friendly . The pit bull had to be . put down due to the extent of her injuries. When she was first found it was thought that she had been hit by a car, but the true nature of her injuries soon came to light. Vet . Martha Smith-Blackmore was so shocked by the extent of the abuse that . she had to walk away and give herself a break as she examined the dog's . body. 'Her joints were pulled apart like medieval times,' she said. 'She was beaten, stabbed, burned over weeks to months and maybe her whole life. And could not walk.' The . vet added: 'When I saw how vulnerable she was and I understood . immediately the duration of her suffering, my heart collapsed.' Torture: The dog's limbs had been repeatedly pulled apart . Public outrage saw a number of tips come flooding in to help the Quincy police department in tracking the perpetrator, along with thousands of dollars that had been set aside for a reward. The Animal Rescue League of Boston offered $5,000, followed by the California-based Animal Legal Defense League put up $2,000. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals offered up another $5,000, and Second Chance Rescue out of New York raised $11,000 for information. The Animal Rescue League raised also raised $35,000 additionally to be put toward the investigation of this and other animal abuse cases. The story has prompted Facebook groups that have become the sites of a tremendous outpouring of outrage and grief, and resulted in a vigil held for 'Puppy Doe.' In pain: The dog had suffered such extensive abuse that she had to be put to sleep . Horrified: Vet Martha Blackmore-Smith says she was heart broken by the extent of abuse the dog suffered . Although there was no evidence of . sexual interference, which the vet said can be seen in such abuse cases, . the dog's joints had been separated from being pulled apart repeatedly. Despite the pain and . suffering Puppy Doe had clearly experienced in her short life, staff at . the rescue center said she was sweet natured. 'Within . hours of being found she had pain medication, food and love. She . experienced some tenderness and some care at the end of her life,' Dr . Smith-Blackmore said, adding that the dog's injuries were so severe she . would have always been in pain if she hadn't been put down. As well as the burn and stab marks, the dog's vertebrae had been smashed from being hit by a baseball bat or board.","Radoslaw Czerkawski, 32, charged with 12 counts of animal cruelty and one count of misleading police .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Sinea Nijjer, 20, is accused of falsely imprisoning a man while he was held at knifepoint and put through a degrading ritual . A man who claims he was 'tortured' by a prostitute and two men told a court today how he feared his genitals would be mutilated. The alleged victim - who cannot be named for legal reasons - says he was held at knifepoint by two men who ambushed him as he went to visit a prostitute in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. The man, who had pretended to be a footballer to impress 20-year-old Sinead Nijjer, claims he was lured to her flat by suggestive text messages, then jumped by her accomplices. Rico Awad, 21, and Leam Ryan, 22, allegedly held a knife to his throat, then forced him to perform press-ups naked on the floor before putting on women's underwear and kissing Nijjer's feet. He was later told to scrub his own face with a toilet brush and deliver an embarrassing 'confession' to an iPad, which the men used to film the entire ordeal, Aylesbury Crown Court heard. The alleged victim said that he only escaped by exaggerating his mild breathing difficulties so that his captors panicked and called an ambulance. He added that a fourth man attempted to persuade him to drop the case by offering £1,500. However, Nijjer and the other accused deny holding the man prisoner, claiming instead that he refused to pay for a sex session, and invented the blackmail claims to save face. Giving evidence from behind a screen, the man told how he pretended to be a semi-professional footballer to impress Nijjer. He said he went to her flat in Aylesbury, Buckinghashire, in July last year and paid £50 for oral sex, which he had done once before. The man claims that after arriving at her flat for a third encounter, he was grabbed by the neck and pushed against the wall by a man as Nijjer walked into her bedroom. 'Lured': The victim said he had visited Nijjer twice before and was tempted over by text messages - before being grabbed by two men . Denial: Nijjer and the other accused claim the alleged victim in fact asked for a dominatrix session - then refused to pay . He asked what was going on and was told . to shut up, noticing there was a second man in the flat holding a . kitchen knife and wearing a balaclava. 'He said ""I’m going to cut you up"",' the man told the jury. 'The black guy said to me ""take your clothes off"". I thought maybe they’re going to cut my penis off.' After being forced to apologise to Nijjer for disrespecting her, the man was put on the floor and told he was going to be 'taught a lesson'. Ordeal: The man claims he was made to do press-ups naked on the floor and kiss Nijjer's feet . 'The man said if you do what we tell you then you won’t get hurt,' said the alleged victim. 'I was kissing her feet for maybe 15 seconds. She took a sip of her drink and sprayed it all over me.' The man, a Muslim, said he was made to read a statement to the camera explaining that even though it was Ramadan he was going to see prostitutes rather than praying at a mosque. 'They were getting a buzz out of the whole thing,' said the man. 'They were laughing all the way through. I was scared.' Accused: Rico Awad is one of two men accused of forcing the ordeal on the alleged victim and falsely imprisoning him . The victim told the court: 'He said if you don’t we’re going to expose these pictures of you. He said all of these will go out and your whole family will be ashamed and your community will be embarrassed.' The man then began to have breathing difficulties, causing his alleged captors to panic. He decided to exaggerate the problem and asked for an inhaler, even though he did not use one. As the group became more panicked, one of the men allegedly told the victim: 'I’m a Muslim too. After all this is finished we are going to go to the mosque together and forget all of this happened. Just don’t die on me.' Eventually an ambulance was called and the man was able to alert a paramedic. Nijjer, 20, from Aylesbury, Rico Awad, 21, of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire and Leam Ryan, 22, of no fixed address, claim they never harmed the victim or held him hostage, instead claiming he refused to pay for a domination session with Nijjer. In cross-examination, the man was asked whether he had spent an hour-long session with Nijjer before declaring 'I'm not paying'. But he denied that version of events, which he said was 'incorrect'.

"By . Harriet Cooke . Ouch: The six inch pencil that became embedded in 13-year-old Robbie Appleby-Socket's hand, leaving him in agony . A thirteen-year-old was left in agony after a hospital sent him home twice with a pencil embedded in his hand. Robbie Appleby-Socket, of Askern, Doncaster, was larking about with his friends when the six-inch pencil wedged inside his skin, leaving him in severe pain. His mother Emma rushed him to Doncaster Royal Infirmary's accident and emergency department, where he was told to come back the following day for an operation. But when the pair returned the next morning, they were told Robbie’s name was not on the list, and the operation would have to be rescheduled for another time. Desperate Mrs Appleby-Socket was then forced to take her son 20 miles from their home to Pinderfields Hopsital in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. Doctors there operated immediately and Robbie stayed in hospital for two nights on an antibiotic drip to ensure the injury would not become infected. Mrs Appleby-Socket said: 'Robbie was in agony and the pencil was protruding from his hand but the staff at Doncaster Royal Infirmary didn’t seem that concerned. 'You would have thought it was something they could have done straight away but they just left the pencil where it was, put a bandage over it and said he would have to come back. 'I was concerned because I thought if he knocked his hand the pencil could go even further inside and cause serious injury. 'I was disgusted at their attitude because I feared he could lose his hand through infection. 'I was told he would need an operation but they couldn’t do it until the following morning so he was sent home with the pencil still embedded in his hand. 'The staff didn’t even check the wound. It was only when I asked about infection that they gave us some antibiotics. Stressed: Robbie Appleby-Socket, 13, and his mother Emma, after their ordeal at Doncaster Royal Infirmary . 'I couldn’t believe what I was hearing when we went back the following day and was sent home again. 'He needed treatment quickly so I drove straight to Pinderfields Hospital. I told them the story and they couldn’t believe that the pencil had been left in his hand for so long. The staff there were absolutely amazing.' A spokesman for the Doncaster Royal Infirmary said: 'Robbie was seen by the A and E team who were concerned and asked an orthopaedic surgeon to assess him. 'Robbie was then listed for surgery the next morning and sent home with painkillers to rest and fast overnight in preparation. 'Unfortunately, due to a number of very urgent cases Robbie’s operation was postponed. We apologised and gave him further painkillers and antibiotics. 'We apologise to Robbie and his family for the fact we could not operate on him when planned.'

"By . Lizzie Parry . Smoking cannabis before the age of 15 could lead to insomnia later in life, a new study has found. Researchers in the U.S. discovered any history of using the drug was associated with an increased risk of reporting difficulty getting enough sleep. Participants in the study reported struggling to fall asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, experiencing non-restorative sleep and feeling sleepy during the day. Scientists at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia found the strongest association in adults who used cannabis before the age of 15. A new study, carried out at the University of Pennsylvania, found those who use cannabis before they turn 15 are twice as likely to suffer insomnia later in life. File picture . 'Current and past marijuana users are more likely to experience sleep problems,' said lead author Jilesh Chheda, research assistant at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, working with Dr. Michael Grandner, the senior author on the study. 'The most surprising finding was that there was a strong relationship with age of first use, no matter how often people were currently using marijuana. 'People who started using early were more likely to have sleep problems as an adult.' The study was published recently in the online supplement of the journal Sleep. To gather their results, researchers assessed a group of adults, ranging in age from 20 to 59, who responded to the 2007-08 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A history of drug use was reported by 1,811 participants. Cannabis use was assessed as any history of use, the age a person first tried marijuana and the number of times a person used the drug in the last month. Sleep-related problems were considered severe if they happened at least 15 days each month. The . results suggest that those who start using cannabis in adolescence may . put themselves at higher risk of suffering insomnia later in life. Researchers . also concluded those who begin using the drug earlier could be more . likely to experience trouble sleeping for other reasons, including . stress. 'Current and past marijuana users are more likely to experience sleep problems,' said lead author Jilesh Chheda, research assistant at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. File picture . The authors of the study said insomnia may be one of the reasons people start, or continue, to use marijuana. But they go on to suggest the drug's use in combating sleep problems are likely to be ineffective, if they are still experiencing insomnia. 'Marijuana use is common, with about half of adults having reported using it at some point in their life,' said Chheda. 'As it becomes legal in many states (in the U.S.), it will be important to understand the impact of marijuana use on public health, as its impact on sleep in the 'real world' is not well known.' According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, marijuana use among young people has been increasing since 2007. Some experts have linked the rise with increased public debate over the drug's legal status. The federal government considers marijuana a Schedule I substance that has no medicinal uses and a high risk for abuse. However, Colorado and Washington have legalised marijuana for adult recreational use, and 21 states have passed laws allowing its use as a treatment for certain medical conditions.","Researchers at University of Pennsylvania found any history of using the drug was associated with difficulty sleeping .

"By . Lydia Warren . Twenty dogs who were being looked after by the son of Arizona Senator Jeff Flake at a kennel have died following an air conditioning malfunction. Sheriff's deputies found the animals' bodies piled up in a shed at Green Acres Dog Boarding Facility in Gilbert on Friday after they sweltered to death over night. Authorities said one of the dogs had chewed through an electrical wire and cut off the air conditioning to the room, leaving them to overheat in temperatures reaching 100 degrees. They were in the care of Austin Flake, the son of Senator Flake, and his wife Logan while the kennel's owners, Logan's parents Maleisa and Todd Hughes, were on holiday in Florida. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Twenty dogs died at Green Acres Dog Boarding Facility (pictured) in Gilbert, Arizona after one of them chewed threw a wire and broke the air conditioning unit. The minders found their bodies on Friday . Found: There were 30 dogs staying at the kennel in Gilbert and only 10 of the animals survived the night . Chewed: One of the dogs managed to gnaw through a wire for the air conditioning, pictured . Austin Flake and his wife last checked on the dogs in the west area of the property at 11pm and then went to sleep in the east part of the house that is served by a different air conditioning unit. When they checked on the dogs at 5.30am on Friday, they found them sweltering in temperatures reaching 100 degrees and the chewed wire sparking, Maleisa Hughes told CNN. They pulled the animals' bodies outside and tried to save them by hosing them with cold water, but they could not be revived and the couple did not call 911 before the dogs died, CNN reported. Some of the owners' conduct since the death was suspicious, the pet owners and officials said. The families of the dogs told KPNX that they were not told about the incident until the day after the deaths - and that the owner initially said the animals had run away. 'I thought, ""Well, I should just go over there"",' one owner, Kathy Harrington, said. 'I pulled up to two dead dogs in the driveway.' In charge: Austin Flake, right, and his wife were left in charge of the dogs while her parents, who own the kennels, were away. Flake is the son of Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, pictured top left with the whole family . Emotional: Maleisa Hughes, who owns the kennel with her husband, was on holiday in Florida at the time of the incident. She sobbed as she said the chewed wires could have sparked a fire and killed her family . Killed: An official can be seen loading dog body bags into a truck after the died in 100 degree temperatures . Valerie Collins, who left two dogs at the facility, said that she also went to the kennel to demand answers. 'We went out of the front and he carried my Daisy, who was lifeless,' she told Fox. 'I prayed that they were still alive and he just threw her at my feet like a piece of meat.' Jacqueline Heath, who lost three dogs, said her home would never be the same. 'It still doesn't seem real that I'm never going to see these dogs again,' she told CBS as she broke down in tears. 'We don't have them running around. We're never going to have them to cuddle.' Owner Todd Hughes has since admitted that he lied to the animals' owners about the dogs running away. 'I wasn't thinking straight, but I should have thought better than that,' Hughes said, USA Today reported. 'Nobody trained me on how to handle this. I made a bad decision. It was terrible.' Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio called the incident a 'tragic accident' that had left officers 'heartbroken and devastated' - but he still cast doubt on the owners' account. Heartbroken: Jacqueline Heath said her home would never feel the same after losing her three dogs . Suspicions: Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said investigations into the deaths were continuing . 'It seems unreasonable that dogs could be healthy at 11.00pm at night and dead by 5.30am the next morning as the owners suggest,' he said. No charges have yet been filed but his office continues to investigate. 'We are going to check phone records. We are going to check air condition meters,' Arpaio said. 'We will see if there is any violation of the animal cruelty laws, any criminal intent, neglect.' Maleisa Hughes, a mother of nine, became emotional as she spoke with reporters. 'Nobody feels worse about these poor special angel dogs than me and my husband, my daughter and my son-in-law,' she said. 'Nobody, nobody.' Speaking out: Senator Jeff Flake, pictured beside his son Austin, wife Cheryl and daughter Alexis at an election night rally in 2008, said his 'heart went out to owners who lost their pets' in the incident . 'The wire was sparking,' she continued. 'It could have burned down our whole house. My whole house could have burned down and all my children could have died, and then it would have been a tragedy. But because it didn't catch fire, we're dog killers.' One of the dogs that died belonged to the owners. She refused to comment on her connection with Senator Flake, simply saying that Austin Flake was her son-in-law and that she didn't feel it was appropriate to comment about her state senator. Following the public outcry over the incident, Senator Flake issued a public apology. 'I can't imagine the devastating loss these families are experiencing. My heart goes out to the owners who lost their beloved pets,' he said.

"By . Bryan Keogh . A Florida father and his son are in intensive care after being attacked by a massive swarm of yellow jacket wasps. David Alvarez, who is allergic to hornets, and his seven-year-old son Jordan were taking their dog for a stroll last Wednesday in a wooded area they frequented near where they live in Altamonte Springs, Florida, when one of them stepped on a nest, disturbing thousands of wasps. The subsequent attack left them both covered in marks and swollen, said Jennifer Jones, Mr Alvarez's wife. 'It's just horrible,' she said. David Alvarez, his son Jordan and their dog were attacked by a swam of wasps last week in central Florida. Both father and son remain in intensive care at nearby hospitals . They were both raced to separate, nearby hospitals for treatment. Mr Alvarez, who has developed pneumonia and a blood clot is still unconscious and heavily sedated, according to WKMG in Orlando. His son was taken out of the intensive care unit but was readmitted on Monday due to some difficulty breathing. Their dog was also stung, leading to liver failure, but has since recovered. The woods where David Alvarez and his son encountered the wasp nest is near his mother's home northwest of Altamonte Springs . One of Jordan's shoes still lies in the woods where he and his father were attacked by thousands of wasps . 'They will be lucky to survive this,' said Jim Kunze, a beekeeper who happened to live in the area where the two were attacked and came to their aid. 'They were attacked that viciously.' After the attack, Jordan led his dad out of the woods to a road, where they managed to flag down Brien Schou, who rolled down his window to see what they needed. Wasps immediately flew into his vehicle. 'I was driving . down the street and I saw a man and a boy stumbling out of the woods and . stumbled across the road covered in bees,' said Mr Schou, who called 911. Mr Kunze the beekeeper, who lived about a block away, heard people screaming for help and hopped in his truck to see what the fuss was. 'It was pretty bad. It was chicken pox times five, at least,' he said. The pair were lucky this man, Jim Kunze, lived nearby. A beekeeper, he quickly began killing the wasps once he arrived on the scene . Mr Kunze got to work immediately. After putting Jordan inside his air-conditioned truck, he donned his bee outfit and began killing the wasps that continued to attack Mr Alvarez. 'I know he wanted to quit because he . said, ""I just wanted to give up because it hurt so bad, but I had to . keep going because I seen daddy laying there on the ground."" I just . can't believe how strong he is,' said Jones of her son, adding that when she arrived at the scene she saw a yellow jacket crawling out of his ear. Kunze said it was the dog that likely disturbed the wasps as he gamboled in front of the father and son. 'They've got guards at their entrance, and once the first . one stings, it puts out a pheromone, it alerts the rest and the rest go . to that point,' he said. One of the wasps that attacked David Alvarez lies dead on the road near the woods, killed by Mr Kunze .","David Alvarez and son Jordan are in intensive care in local hospitals after being stung repeatedly .

"By . Aap . A Queensland MP and former neighbour of Gerard and Allison Baden-Clay has told a Brisbane murder trial how  one of two female screams he heard on the last night Mrs Baden-Clay was seen alive sounded like a woman losing consciousness. Dr Bruce Flegg, a registered medical practitioner and the member for the western Brisbane state electorate of Moggill, said on Tuesday he had been in his home a few streets away from the Baden-Clay's Brookfield house when he heard the cries. 'It was a single reverse crescendo in volume, tapering off, and what I would describe as having an involuntary quality,' he told the Brisbane Supreme Court. Scroll down for audio . Two short screams and a woman losing consciousness: Liberal National Party Queensland MP Dr Bruce Flegg (pictured leaving the Brisbane Supreme Court) told the jury on day nine of the Baden-Clay murder trial how on the last night Allison Baden-Clay was seen alive he heard two female screams, the first of which sounded like a woman in a partial state of lost consciousness . Last seen alive: Allison Baden-Clay (pictured) was last seen alive on the night of April 19, 2012, when the 43-year-old mother of three young girls was living a few streets away from Queensland politician, Dr Bruce Flegg, who told the Brisbane Supreme Court he heard two short female screams from his house that evening . Lending friends: Stuart Christ (above, left) and Robert Cheesman (right) both high school friends of the accused have told his Brisbane Supreme Court murder trial how they each loaned him $90,000 to prop up his ailing real estate business, but apart from a few interest payments the loans had not been repaid . 'The tone ... was very strongly suggestive of a reduced level of consciousness,' Dr Flegg said. 'I remember it very clearly because it was distressing and I'm not one to be distressed by what I hear.' Dr Flegg said after he heard the first scream he had gone out to the front of the house to investigate and then checked with someone staying at his house whether they also heard the sound, but they hadn't. A few minutes later he said heard a similar scream. Allison Baden-Clay, 43, was reported missing by her husband on April 20, 2012. Her body was found 10 days later on a creek bank on Kholo Creek in Anstead, in Brisbane's west. Dr Flegg was the 59th witness in murder trial of Gerard Baden-Clay, who has pleaded not guilty to killing Allison Baden Clay in April 2012. The trial is in its third week. The Liberal National Party backbencher said he knew Baden-Clay socially through the Kenmore Chamber of Commerce, which operated in a neighbouring suburb and of which  Baden-Clay was the president. He said Baden-Clay asked him for a $400,000 loan in December 2011 saying he owed money to business partners and wanted to keep control of his real estate business.Dr Flegg said Baden-Clay phoned him again in March 2012 and Dr Flegg asked a woman called Sue Heath to return the call because he was busy electioneering. In evidence during his trial, which is now in its third week, the accused Gerard Baden-Clay (pictured, left) said a marriage counsellor had advised he and his wife to spend 15 minutes a day letting Allison (right) 'vent' after she discovered he was having an affair . Ms Heath has already testified that Baden-Clay asked for a loan of about $300,000 during the conversation.Several days later, Baden-Clay called Dr Flegg again.'I think Gerard had the understanding Sue had conveyed me the intent of the call and it wasn't going anywhere,' he said. Friends of Gerard Baden-Clay's also gave evidence about loans to the former prestige real estate agent. Meanwhile, two high school friends of Baden-Clay told the trial they lent him large sums of money to prop up his ailing real estate business in early 2011.Stuart Christ and Robert Cheesman told the trial they lent him $90,000 each after he asked them and a third friend for help.Mr Christ said during a February 2011 meeting with Baden-Clay the group of four discussed that his Brisbane real estate business had expanded 'massively' but Brisbane floods in January 2011 had affected sales and halted cash flow. The trial has heard that by 2009 Gerard Baden-Clay and his wife Allison (pictured on their 23 August, 1997 wedding day) were 'living under the same roof, but living separate lives' and that the mother-of-three had told a psychologist she and her husband had 'minimal contact' and had not been sexually intimate since 2007 . 'Without a further cash injection the business would have been in severe trouble,' Mr Christ said.'Simply there was no cash in the bank to pay the bills.'Mr Christ and Mr Cheesman told the court that after looking closely at the business's books they agreed to lend their friend $90,000 each on the understanding he'd pay it back with 10 per cent interest.Both said Baden-Clay made about three interest repayments on the loans but the repayments stopped around mid-2012.In April 2012, when Allison Baden-Clay died, no part of the two $90,000 loans had been repaid.Under cross examination Mr Cheesman said Baden-Clay had a number of assets in his own name, including shares, and was personally financially secure.Mr Cheesman agreed with defence barrister Michael Byrne that if the business had failed Baden-Clay could 'walk away from it'. Two expert witnesses gave evidence to the trial about Ms Baden-Clay's body, which was found on a mud bank at Kholo Creek on April 30, 2012.Retired university professor Jacob John, an expert on microscopic algae, said he examined a piece of bone, some bone marrow and some liver tissue from Mrs Baden-Clay's body.Dr John told the court microscopic algae called diatoms are present in all bodies of water and if someone drowns, diatoms are inevitably found in parts such as the liver, kidney and bone marrow.He said a water sample from the Kholo Creek near where Mrs Baden-Clay's body was found showed there was a diatom 'bloom' in the water but he could not find any in the samples he was given.'The subject concerned did not drown in Kholo Creek or anywhere,' Dr John concluded. 'There was no evidence of drowning at all.'Earlier, a forensic entomologist estimated the mother-of-three had been dead for between three and 11 days before she was found.Professor James Wallman said he examined fly and maggot specimens taken from Mrs Baden-Clay's remains.Based on their size and age he estimated they must have present for three to four days, if the air temperature was high.If the temperature was cooler the insects could have been on Mrs Baden-Clay's body longer, he said.He agreed with Crown prosecutor Danny Boyle the insect evidence was consistent with Mrs Baden-Clay being dead 11 days.

"By . Ian Drury . Officers have been told to respect the ‘culture and history’ of anyone caught chewing khat, as a ban on the drug came into force at midnight. From today, the herbal stimulant, grown in Africa and popular among the Somali community in the UK, is an illegal Class C drug. But police have been told to issue only a slap on the wrist ‘Khat Warning’ for a first offence, then a £60 fine. Only if they were caught using khat on a third occasion would a person face arrest and a court hearing, according to guidance issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO). Scroll down for video . Illegal: Khat, a herbal stimulant, grown in Africa and popular among the Somali community in the UK, is an illegal Class C drug from tonight . The guidelines are for dealing with people possessing khat for personal use. The ACPO policy stated: ‘It is important that officers… retain their operational discretion; taking into account that khat has historically not been a controlled drug and was part of the culture for certain communities linked to the Horn of Africa.’ About 2,560 tons of khat was imported in 2011-12 with a value of £13.8million. It is usually chewed in family homes, at community parties or at legal khat cafes for up to six hours at a time. No third time lucky: Police have been told to issue only warning for a first offence, then a £60 fine, with offenders only facing arrest on a third occasion . But security experts have warned that proceeds from selling the drug, are believed to be fuelling Islamist extremist groups, such as al-Shabab. Home Secretary Theresa May overruled her own drug advisers to ban khat saying that if she failed to act Britain would become a transit route for illegally shipping it into mainland Europe. Chief Constable Andy Bliss, of ACPO, said: ‘Enforcement of the khat ban will be firm but proportionate. Officers will take into account the nature of the offence and its severity, using a tiered approach towards offences relating to possession for personal use.’ Khat is a leafy green plant containing two main stimulants which speed up your mind and body. Their main effects are similar to, but less powerful than, amphetamines such as speed. Khat is most common in communities on Africa’s Horn, but it is becoming more common in Europe. The key effects and risks of khat include alertness, happiness and becoming more talkative. The drug also suppresses appetite and can cause insomnia. There is also evidence that khat can make pre-existing mental health problems worse and cause paranoid and psychotic reactions.

"By . Mark Prigg . A major security flaw in Google's Play Store that could expose user's private data has been revealed by researchers. The bug, which the team has worked with Google, Facebook and other app makers to fix before revealing it, put millions of users at risk, the researchers said. The bug would allow hackers to steal user data from Facebook, Amazon and others using 'secret' keys the team uncovered. The Columbia Engineering Team found thousands of secret keys in android apps (shown by red arrows) that could be used to steal user data . The researchers created an app called PlayDrone, which used various hacking techniques to circumvent Google security to successfully download Google Play apps and recover their sources. They were then able to decompile the apps to see their code. They then found developers often store their secret keys in their apps software, similar to usernames/passwords info, and these can be then used by anyone to maliciously steal user data or resources from service providers such as Amazon and Facebook. The research was revealed in a a paper presented—and awarded the prestigious Ken Sevcik Outstanding Student Paper Award—at the ACM SIGMETRICS conference. Jason Nieh, professor of computer science at Columbia Engineering, and PhD candidate Nicolas Viennot said they were stunned by the scale of their find. 'Google Play has more than one million apps and over 50 billion app downloads, but no one reviews what gets put into Google Play—anyone can get a $25 account and upload whatever they want. Very little is known about what’s there at an aggregate level,' says Nieh . 'Given the huge popularity of Google Play and the potential risks to millions of users, we thought it was important to take a close look at Google Play content.' Nieh and Viennot’s paper is the first to make a large-scale measurement of the huge Google Play marketplace. The researchers created an app called PlayDrone, which used various hacking techniques to circumvent Google security to successfully download Google Play apps and recover their sources. PlayDrone scales by simply adding more servers and is fast enough to crawl Google Play on a daily basis, downloading more than 1.1 million Android apps and decompiling over 880,000 free applications. Google Play, the Android app store, has more than one million apps and over 50 billion app downloads . Nieh and Viennot discovered all kinds of new information about the content in Google Play, including a critical security problem: developers often store their secret keys in their apps software, similar to usernames/passwords info, and these can be then used by anyone to maliciously steal user data or resources from service providers such as Amazon and Facebook. These vulnerabilities can affect users even if they are not actively running the Android apps. Nieh claims that even “Top Developers,” designated by the Google Play team as the best developers on Google Play, included these vulnerabilities in their apps. 'We’ve been working closely with Google, Amazon, Facebook, and other service providers to identify and notify customers at risk, and make the Google Play store a safer place,' says Viennot. 'Google is now using our techniques to proactively scan apps for these problems to prevent this from happening again in the future.' In fact, Nieh adds, developers are already receiving notifications from Google to fix their apps and remove the secret keys.","Bug put millions of users at risk .

"By . Daniel Mills . A New Zealand transgender woman, whose family sparked an outpouring of sympathy online when they thought she was bashed, actually sustained her injuries after falling from a tree. Police said Anahera ""Angel"" Rangitaawa, 33, was found near the Copthorne Hotel in Palmerston North, near Wellington, in the early hours of Sunday morning. At first police said they could not explain the critical injuries to her face, skull and other parts of her body when she was taken to Wellington Hospital and placed in an induced coma. But what Angel's family first suspected was a targeted attack because of her gender, actually turned out to be something much less sinister when police confirmed she had fallen from a tree. Anahera ""Angel"" Rangitaawa was taken to a Wellington hospital with sever head injuries after she fell from a tree she tried to climb. Her family, including aunt Esther Topfer, was of the belief that the woman had been attacked by a gang of men and took their frustration to Facebook . Esther Topfer, the woman's aunt, made the incredible accusation that she was the victim of a targeted assault and even suggested that the area which she was found,  Palmerston North, was the 'transbash capital of New Zealand.' In a post on Facebook, Ms Topfer alleged 'Angel' was attacked by three men. 'I am saddened and appalled that in the 21st Century ignorant, judgmental and evil people can smash a person to within an inch of their life for being who they are,' she wrote. More...

The transgender woman is out of a coma, but remains in a serious but stable condition in a Wellington Hospital. While Ms Topfer kept update's of Angel's condition coming through on Facebook, followers, friends and family of the transgender woman made their feelings known, calling her unknown and now non-existent attackers 'bastards.'

Others accused New Zealand police of not doing their job properly by not being able to explain what happened to the transgender woman. 'Unexplained' is typical police hype downplay,' one commenter wrote. When Ms Topfer was informed that her niece fell, she publicly apologised but defended her outrage saying 'that was the initial details they (police) were given.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Men with broader faces are more likely to be identified as dominant, research shows (library image) If you’re a man who struggles to get his own way at home, it may be down to the shape of your face. Men with narrower skulls are less likely to be regarded as dominant than those with wider ones, a study has found. Psychologists from Stirling University asked volunteers to look at photographs of students with neutral expressions and rate the dominance of their personality. They also photographed the volunteers and asked them to fill out a questionnaire about their own levels of authority. The research revealed a strong link between the breadth of a man’s face compared to its height, and how dominant he was considered by himself and others. The same could not be said of women. Writing in the journal Personality and Individual Differences, the study’s lead author Viktoria Mileva said that others’ perception of men with broad faces could lead them to believe they are dominant. But she added: ‘It is also possible that men with a higher width to height ratio act inherently more dominant, perhaps as a result of increased testosterone.’ 'One potential mechanism which may explain why fWHR affects male self-perceptions of dominance is how others behave towards them. ‘If certain behavioural qualities which signal dominance, such as achievement drive, aggression and cheating and trustworthiness are visible in people’s faces through their fWHR, as our study one suggests, then actions towards these individuals may differ. ‘This could in turn lead to altered behaviour from the faces’ owners in response to how they are treated by others. ‘However, it is also possible that men with a higher fWHR act and feel inherently more dominant, perhaps as a result of increased testosterone’. Previous studies have found that men with wider faces are more likely to be seen as aggressive, but also more attractive for short-term relationships.

"By . Louise Cheer . An Australian activist has been arrested by Malaysian police after protesting against a rare earth plant that has been accused by environmentalists of producing radioactive waste. Activist Natalie Lowrey was arrested along with 15 other protestors from Malaysia on Sunday outside the plant owned by Australian mining company, Lynas Corp, in the eastern state of Pahang, SBS reported. A police official told The Guardian, Lowrey could face up to two years in prison but at minimum she could be deported back to Australia. The Australian remains hopeful that she will be deported, posting on Facebook: 'Thanks for the supportive messages :) I am going fine not sure when I will be deported but hope to see you soon xx.' Natalie Lowrey (left) is facing deportation after she was thrown behind bars by police in Malaysia (right) during a protest against a Lynas Corp rare earths plant . Following the arrest, Lowrey also posted one of the men had been badly hurt by police. SBS reported the other protestors had been released and could face future charges. But Lowrey was still in police custody for 'investigations', a district police official said. He did not offer anymore information. The term rare earths refers to 18 metals that are used for industrial and hi-tech techniques, including creating smartphones, hybrid car batteries, wind turbines, steel and low-energy light bulbs. Lowrey has tweeted that she has been treated well by officials and awaits a deportation date . Lynas Corp is trying to wrestle monopoly away from China who dominate the rare earths industry, with 95 per cent of the market's global production coming out of the country. It is also home to 23 per cent of global reserves of the metals. Protestors were arrested when some infiltrated the police barricade during demonstrations, according to Malaysian anti-Lynas activist Tan Bun Teet. They believe the plant is producing radioactive waste that is threatening the environment and the population. Environmentalist groups believe the Lynas-run plant is producing radioactive material and poses a threat to the environment and population . Sydney-based Lowrey is awaiting a deportation date. She arrived last week for Sunday's demonstration. In late 2012, Lynas began its operations outside Kuantan - Pahang's capital - in an industrial park after more than a year of delay because of strong opposition from the local people. Since then, environmentalists have gathered at the Malaysian plant in a slew of protests. The mining giant has been adamant the plant is safe, saying radioactive waste was minimal and would be disposed of safely.","She was arrested on Sunday with 15 other protestors from Malaysia .

"By . Chris Greenwood . and Jaya Narain . 'Torture': Kyle McArdle, 26, was Tasered five times by police and has won a five-figure compensation award . Two police officers have been sacked after an innocent man was Tasered five times in their van, it was revealed last night. Kyle McArdle, 26, said he passed out from the excruciating pain inflicted by the 50,000-volt weapons after he was dragged from the street. He was shot in the chest, stomach and leg at point-blank range as up to three officers assaulted him. After four years of wrangling, in which Merseyside Police insisted they did nothing wrong, PC Simon Jones and PC Joanne Kelly were fired for gross misconduct. A third officer involved in the incident, Sgt Charlie Tennant, had already been sacked in 2011 for gross misconduct over a separate matter. The case, believed to be the first in which officers have been fired for misusing a Taser, raises questions about the trend to arm police with the potentially deadly weapon. Last night, Mr McArdle said: ‘I have never come across such brutality, and for that to be at the hands of the police – people I would have expected to trust – has been really disturbing. ‘I wasn’t offering any resistance when they launched an unprovoked attack, hitting me on the head and choking me. 'When I raised my hands in self-defence I was Tasered five times and dragged to a police station like a criminal.’ The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said the officers used unnecessary force and ignored national guidelines. Mr McArdle was arrested during a night out for his brother-in-law’s birthday in Liverpool on December 19, 2009. He was grabbed by the three officers after relieving himself in an alley. The car engineer, who works at the Ford Halewood plant, was dragged into a police van. He was Tasered twice – with barbs . attached to charged wires being fired into his body – and had the . pistol-like Tasers themselves pushed directly into his body three times and . discharged, an agonising technique known as a ‘drive stun’. One officer ripped the metal barbs from his body, despite rules that this must be done by a doctor. Mr McArdle said: ‘I just sat on the seat and then I felt a blow to the side of my head from one of the officers, then another blow and I was repeatedly insulted. ‘At no stage was I resisting or even trying to defend myself. ‘Then I was hit again on the temple and choked by one officer using his forearm. I was petrified. I couldn’t breathe and thought I was going to pass out. In self-defence I pushed the officer and that’s when all hell broke loose. ‘One got her Taser out and drive-stunned me to the shoulder and then another aimed his Taser at me. I put my hands out and said, “I’m not doing anything”, and then he shot me. It was absolute agony. All my muscles tensed like I was in cramp – it was excruciating. Questions remain over the proliferation of Tasers among the UK's police forces. Use of the weapon has proved fatal in the past . ‘Then the driver turned round and Tasered me on the shin. ‘I couldn’t believe it - it felt like I had been kidnapped for having a wee in an alley and now I was being tortured in the back of the van. I was in agony and in shock. ‘I tried to grab the Taser to stop it happening again and he Tasered me in the hand and then I was Tasered yet again. I must have passed out because when I came round I was in handcuffs.’ Mr McArdle was charged with assault but was acquitted in September 2010 by a magistrate who questioned the officers’ account. But his ordeal was not over as he fought the force for justice. The IPCC upheld two appeals as the force first recommended ‘management advice’ over the arrest and then said the Taser use was ‘necessary and proportionate’. It criticised police for not giving enough weight to the victim’s account or CCTV footage contradicting what the officers said. Finally, a misconduct hearing led to the sacking of the two officers. Mr McArdle, who had not been in trouble with police before, has won a five-figure compensation sum after suing the force. He said: ‘None of those officers belonged on a police force. They were a disgrace.’ His mother, Christine McArdle, 56, said: ‘To be Tasered while offering no resistance is torture.’ James Dipple-Johnstone, of the IPCC, said: ‘There is public concern over the increase in Taser use. Incidents such as this do nothing to alleviate that concern.’ Merseyside Police said: ‘All officers issued with Tasers are required to complete training and annual re-qualification. 'Since this incident, Merseyside Police has introduced a procedure which requires each use of Taser to be reviewed by a senior officer, prior to submitting details to the Home Office.’","Kyle McArdle passed out from the pain after he was Tasered in Liverpool .

"By . Mark Prigg . Apple is developing a 'smart' iPad cover that can show emails and other notifications even when the iPad is switched off. Patents reveal the new cover could include low power LEDs and other screen technologies to avoid draining the battery. Another design also shows transparent sections int he case, allowing the display to be seen. The case would have low power displays built in, allowing basic messages or icons to be displayed without draining the battery of the iPad too much. The cover will show users notifications via shapes, symbols or words, rather than a battery draining full screen. Depending on the priority of the alert, the visual notification can appear on different portions of the cover. For example, if an incoming email is marked 'important,' a letter-shaped icon may illuminate on a segment near the top of the cover, while a less urgent text message can be displayed near the bottom of the tablet. Apple says the existing volume buttons would be used to scroll through or dismiss alerts. 'The idea is novel and would be useful to iPad owners who always hand-carry their tablet, though the feature would be a drain on battery life,' the site says,. 'Like all Apple patents, it is unknown when such an accessory will hit the market, if at all.' The patents were uncovered by AppleInsider. The patents shows different methods of creating a display. Both the active and passive cover types are designed to transmit notifications to the user via shapes, symbols or words, rather than a battery draining full screen. Depending on the priority of the alert, the visual notification can appear on different portions of the cover. For example, if an incoming email is marked 'important,' a letter-shaped icon may illuminate on a segment near the top of the cover, while a less urgent text message can be displayed near the bottom of the tablet. Apple says the existing volume buttons would be used to scroll through or dismiss alerts. The patent outlines several ways to show alerts. Depending on the priority of the alerts, the visual notification can appear on different portions of the cover. The cover could be revealed in September, when Apple is expected to introduce new iPads. According to reports from Korea, suppliers are gearing up to begin production of the next-generation iPad Air - dubbed iPad Air 2 - later this month. It is expected to feature the 8MP camera seen on the iPhone 5S, a faster processor and, most notably, it could sport Apple's fingerprint scanner to unlock the device. Along with the improved security features promised on iOS 8, this could make the iPad Air 2 the most secure tablet ever. The original iPad Air was launched on Friday 1 November 2013 (stock image shown). Given Apple's preference for launching products on a Friday, a release date for the upgraded iPad Air 2 of 31 October 2014 seems possible, with the company apparently gearing up for a release in Q3 or Q4 this year . In addition to the rumoured fingerprint scanner, Apple's iOS 8 could also help boost the security of its next-generation devices. For example, when connecting to a Wi-Fi network, the software won't reveal your device's MAC address. This is used to identify the device, and can be used to determine who owns it. Apple is also increasing privacy and payment controls in the app store. The tech giant is additionally paying closer attention to the types of apps it approves on its store to avoid developers spamming customers, or showing excessive advertising. According to MacRumors, production of the displays for the next-generation tablet has begun. This will gear it up for release in the autumn, expected to be a Friday towards the end of October, bringing it in line with previous releases. The original iPad Air, for example, launched on Friday 1 November 2013 - perhaps suggest 31 October 2014 could be a favoured date for the latest release, given Apple’s preference of launching products on a Friday. The iPad Air 2 is rumoured to have the same screen size as its predecessor, which sported a 9.7-inch (24.6 centimetres) retina LCD display that had a resolution of 2048 x 1536. It could also have a similar thickness, of 0.3 inches (7.5mm) and a similar weight of around 16.6 oz (470g). It’s thought the camera will be upgraded from the 5MP version seen on the current iPad Air to the same 8MP camera used on the iPhone 5S. This could also include the iSight technology that makes low-light shots easier to take, and allows for slow-motion video to be filmed. California-based Apple Inc (stock image shown) is gearing up to release the latest version of its iPad Air later this year. Rumours suggest the Air 2 will have an faster processor and a better camera than its predecessor. The overall size of the tablet, however, is likely to remain nearly the same . Inside the device, the tablet is expected to sport a new and improved processor in the form of the A8, with Among Tech reporting this will have 50 per cent more performance than the previous A7. And finally, it is almost certain the Air 2 will use the same Touch ID fingerprint sensor to unlock the device. This was introduced on the iPhone 5S and is expected to also be used on the iPhone 6. A new iPad Mini is also expected to be released at the same time as Apple's other flagship models. 'Apple . sees its Touch ID fingerprint scanner as the future of digital security, and . with iOS 8 on the horizon, Apple is opening up that technology to app developers,' Stephen Ashby from iCreate Magazine tells MailOnline. 'The iPad Air 2 will not only be more secure, but it will also make it easier . for users to sign into online accounts or buy things safely and quickly. 'It’s . unlikely that Apple will change its winning formula too much, though. Apple's iPhone 5S (pictured) was the first phone from the tech giant to use the new Touch ID fingerprint technology. This is able to recognise the fingerprint of the user and, when a digit is pressed against the home button at the bottom, it allows the phone to be unlocked without entering a code . 'Aside . from the rumoured Touch ID scanner, improvements to the camera and faster . processor, Apple is unlikely to make other changes to the hardware. 'Expect a . very similar design to the first iPad Air, with a few upgrades and perhaps . another colour option.'

And the staples of our modern diet aren’t . only increasing the risk of dementia, but contributing to depression, . epilepsy and headaches, he believes. Carboydrates are rotting our brains and contributing to devastating diseases such as Alzheimer's, an American neurologist has warned. David Perlmutter, from Florida, believes that even 'good' carbs, such as grains, are severely affecting our brains . Instead of munching on wheat, carbs and sugar,which he calls the brain’s silent killers, we should revert back to the way our ancestors ate – with more meat and fat. As Forbes magazine reports: ‘It’s in the food you eat,’ he writes in his best new book, Grain Brain: The Surprising Truth About Wheat, Carbs, and Sugar – Your Brain’s Silent Killers. ‘The origin of brain disease is in many cases predominantly dietary.’ The solution? Going back to the days when our diet was mainly fat – with this making up 75 per cent of our diet, and carbs just 5 per cent. Protein intake should stay the same as it is, at about 20 per cent. In fact, human genes, he says, have evolved over thousands of years to deal with a high-fat, low-carb diet – and despite this, we eat almost exactly the opposite. He advocates a grain-free, gluten-free diet. 'This low-fat idea that’s been drummed into our heads and bellies,' Perlmutter says, 'is completely off-base and deeply responsible for most of our modern ills.' He added: ‘People get a brain disorder and then wonder what the magic bullet cure will be. They want to treat the symptoms rather than the underlying disease problem. In fact, diet and lifestyle play a huge role in the destiny of a person’s health.’ Instead of munching on wheat, carbs and sugar, which he calls the brain¿s silent killers - we should revert back to the way our ancestors ate ¿ with more meat and fat, says Dr Perlmutter . Research has shown that a high-carb diet may increase the risk of dementia. A study published in Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease found that elderly people who ate a high-carb diet were more than three times as likely to develop mild cognitive impairment – which has been linked with a higher risk of dementia. People whose diets were highest in ‘good’ fats, such as those found in nuts and healthy oils were 42 per cent less likely to get cognitive impairment. Those with a high intake of protein (such as meat and fish) had a reduced risk of 21 per cent. Lead author Rosebud Roberts, a professor in the department of epidemiology at the Mayo Clinic, said: ‘A high-carbohydrate intake could be bad for you because carbohydrates impact your glucose and insulin metabolism. Previous research has shown that high levels of sugar may actually prevent the brain from using it - similar to what is seen with type 2 diabetes . 'Sugar fuels the brain, so moderate intake is good. However, high levels of sugar may actually prevent the brain from using the sugar - similar to what we see with type 2 diabetes.’ She added that high glucose levels might affect the brain's blood vessels and play a role in the development of beta amyloid plaques, proteins toxic to brain health that are found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. It’s thought these plaques are a leading cause of the disease. However Dr Perlmutter's critics argue that diets high in meat and fat have their own risks – such as heart disease. 'Perlmutter uses bits and pieces of the effects of diet on cognitive outcomes — that obese people have a higher risk of cognitive impairment, for example — to construct an ultimately misleading picture of what people should eat for optimal cognitive and overall health,' St. Catherine University professor emerita Julie Miller Jones, told the website FoodNavigator-USA.","David Perlmutter, from Florida, believes that even 'good' carbs, such as grains, raise the risk of dementia, depression, epilepsy and headaches .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Picture the scene: Your nation has made it to the 2014 World Cup Final and the game has gone to a penalty shootout. In dramatic fashion your opponents miss a spot-kick giving your captain the chance to win the tournament, but what are the odds on him scoring? As it turns out, exceedingly high. Not only does he have an area bigger than a cargo container to aim for, but the slow reaction times of any given person compared to a kicked ball in tandem with psychological preparation should - should - seen him put the ball away with ease. At least, that’s the theory. Researchers at Brunel University in London have found that the most skilled goalkeepers can guess the right way in a penalty 70 per cent of the time, but other factors mean they'll only save it a quarter of the time such as Cavani's successful penalty against Costa Rica on 14 June (shown) So far in the 2014 Brazil World cup six penalties have been given - and all six have been scored. Research from Samsung has revealed how fans plan to watch the matches. Presenters on live pause - Adrian . Chiles is the football presenter fans most want to ‘live pause’  - more . than a quarter (26 per cent) admit they will skip past his commentary. Solo spectators - 23 per cent of football fans plan to watch the majority of games at home alone. Out of office - More than a quarter (27 per cent) of fans have booked time off work to watch the football over the next month. Off schedule sport - Nearly . half of fans (44 per cent) are planning to record matches and watch . them at a time that suits them better than the scheduled broadcast . Smart viewing - Almost a third of people (30 per cent) are planning on watching the action unfold on a smartphone, tablet or smart TV. And in the season just gone, in the English Premier League. only 14 of 87 penalties were missed or saved. But what makes penalties so hard to stop? The answer lies in the deceivingly large size of a goal, the short amount of time available to a keeper to react, and psychological mind games. 'If the player hits the ball hard enough the goalkeeper has very little chance of saving it,' Professor of Sport and Learning at the University of Wolverhampton Andrew Lane told MailOnline. 'Penalty taking is all about managing stress; players need to have overlearned the skill and practiced in stressful conditions; they need make their mind up and stick to that decision.' But there is good news for goalkeepers - those that are exceptionally gifted have a significant edge over their colleagues. In research commissioned by Gillette for Brunel University in London they found that World Class footballers can anticipate the actions of an opponent up to 80 milliseconds before they move. That means that as England’s Joe Hart stares down Germany’s Thomas Muller, his brain will automatically notice minute details in the striker’s run up that gives him an indication as to which way he’s going to shoot. Some goalkeepers come off their line when a penalty is being taken (Sevilla keeper Cardozo is seen making a save here) to reduce the area a player has to score, at the expense of having less reaction time. Doing so, however, is not technically legal and if a keeper comes too far of his line the penalty will be retaken . In fact, the researchers working with the Football Association found skilled players could anticipate the actions of their opponent 70 per cent of the time, compared to just 52 per cent for less skilled players. ‘The smallest margins can make the difference between winning and losing,’ said Brunel Professor Mark Williams, who was behind the Anticipation Training research. ‘As a result of extensive training and experience on the pitch, the top players have developed high-refined perceptual and cognitive skills that enable them to anticipate exactly what an opponent will do ahead of the act itself.’ Skilled goalkeepers apparently spend . more time studying the face of the penalty taker and can fixate on the . motion of a kicker’s legs moments before he touches the ball. For . a keeper such as Joe Hart, according to Williams, his ‘visual system is . finely attuned to picking up information from the bodily movements of . an opponent as well as the penalty taker’s preferred tendencies for kick . placement.’ And he added: ‘This research shows that those players who practice their art and train hardest have the best chance of success.’ Some players stutter their run-up to make the keeper commit to a direction first before kicking the other way. Neymar attempted this in the opening came of World Cup 2014 for Brazil but, although Croatia goalkeeper Pletikosa went the right way, he didn't have time to get enough behind the ball to save it . That research is backed up a study by ESPN’s Sports Science on penalty kicks for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. They found that goalkeepers were able to guess the direction of the ball correctly 57 per cent of the time. But this is where the good news stops for goal keepers; because of the time it takes to move, only 22 per cent of those shots were saved. The reason for this is that no amount of psychological preparation can help if a penalty taker knows what he’s doing. On average a ball kicked in a penalty travels at about 70 mph (112km/h), according to Business Insider. With the penalty spot 36ft (11 metres) from the goal, this means it will take the ball less than half a second to reach the net. That gives the goalkeeper around 700 milliseconds to look which way the ball is going, decide which way to jump and move his body in that direction. The penalty spot is 36 feet (11 metres) from the goal. The average speed of a penalty kick is 70 miles (112 kilometres) per hour, which gives the goalkeeper about 700 milliseconds to save it. However it takes most almost a second to do so - meaning they have to move earlier . In reality it takes the goalkeeper up to a second to watch the ball and then jump in its direction – by which the ball will already be nestled in the net, providing the player shot to the side. Instead, what most goalkeepers do is begin their jump and movement before the kick is taken. This leads to some players, such as Brazil’s Neymar in their recent game against Croatia, to stutter their run-up and entice the keeper to move before they’ve kicked the ball, allowing them to shoot the other way. The short amount of time available for a keeper to react and then begin his jump means the players have a huge advantage. But it’s not just human biology that hampers goalkeepers – it’s the size of the goal, too. A football goal is 24 ft (7.3 metres) wide and eight feet (2.4 metres) tall, giving It an area of 192 square feet (17.9 square metres). Covering this entire area, bigger than a cargo container, is not easy. This, combined with the short amount of time available, shows just how difficult it is for goalkeepers to save a penalty. Another factor working against goalkeepers is the sheer size of the goal. Football goals have a total area of 192 square feet (17.9 square metres) into which a player can shoot and, with the ball starting just 36ft (11 metres) away, it gives the goalkeeper little time to make a save (stock image shown) And that’s not all; a study by the University of British Columbia (UBC) found that ‘game theory’ played an important part in deciding the outcome of a penalty kick. For those unfamiliar with game theory it’s the suggestion that opponents in any scenario, from war to chess, will follow predictable strategies to try and outwit each other. According to associate professor in UBC’s Department of Computer Science Kevin Leyton-Brown the world’s top players such as Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Iker Casillas are not just world-class athletes, but also skilled and rational decision-makers as well. Kickers and goalies have to make decisions simultaneously because things happen so fast. They have to decide to go right or left or in the middle. On top of that, 'kickers are usually better at kicking to one side than the other,' according to the researchers. 'You would think that the kicker would always kick to his stronger side, but if he did the goalie would always jump to that side and the kicker would be worse off. 'So a kicker, like someone who bluffs in poker, sometimes has to pick the lesser option and kick to his weak side to make goalies uncertain of what he’s going to do. 'What researchers found when they looked at this publicly available data was that kickers and goalies usually pick their equilibrium strategies. 'Kickers kick to their weak side just often enough so that the goalie doesn’t always want to jump the same way. Likewise, goalies picked an equilibrium strategy for blocking shots.' All of this combined shows how much of an art form saving or scoring a penalty really is. Perhaps teams can have a new excuse if they come to failing in penalty shoot-out again - it’s simply science and maths working against the team.","London's Brunel University found that skilled players can read opponents .

Samsung, along with collaborators Giovanni Pelizzoli and Alice Biotti, introduced the prototype for its Smart Bike at a design trade show in Milan earlier this year. The group has been working on a concept bike as part of its Maestros Academy, which was co-founded with designer Leo Burnett’s Milan office. The frame itself pictured) is made of curved aluminium, which helps absorb some of the vibrations from the road before they hit the rider . A GPS system tracks people’s daily routes and lets local authorities know which ones should be turned into real bike-lanes . For the smart bike, the design team wanted to help reduce the number of cyclists involved in accidents. According to the World Health Organisation, cyclists now account for five per cent of all road traffic deaths in the world. While the Samsung bike is currently a concept design, with no plans for sale, others are working on making their versions of a smart bike a reality. For instance, the Canadian Vanhawks Valour smartbike offers turn-by-turn navigation by using low energy Bluetooth to connect to a smartphone for directions. The bike also has a blind-spot detector to alert a rider to potential danger by vibrating the handlebars. Designer Ali Zahid, who has launched a Kickstarter campaign to commercialise the bike, said it will get cleverer over time by learning to avoid potholes and suggesting safer routes.","Samsung teamed up with Leo Burnett’s Milan office to create the prototype .

"The Queen's bank has denied claims in European newspapers that Osama Bin Laden ever held an account with the organisation. The accusation follows an operation by German customs officials seized documents from the Caymen Island branch of Coutts as it arrrived in Hamburg port. The two containers inspected by German officials contained an estimated 14,000 documents. The officials moved in to discover details of suspected tax evasion by German nationals. Osama Bin Laden, pictured, was disowned by his wealthy family who made their fortune in construction . Coutts recently closed its branch in the Caribbean tax haven and was transferring the information to a special data centre in Geneva. According to the Daily Telegraph, European newspapers claimed that account details relating to Bin Laden and his family were among the documents seized in Hamburg. However Coutts denied they ever had a relationship with the terror leader. A spokesperson for the private bank said: 'We are not aware of any investigation into our trust company or its papers and we are working with the authorities to allow these papers to continue on their way. 'At no time have we ever looked after the financial affairs of Osama bin Laden or his immediate family. His individual financial affairs have never been an issue or interest of Coutts.' Bin Laden came from an incredibly wealthy family in Saudi Arabia that made its fortune in construction. His father, Mohammed, who died in 1967, had close links to the Saudi Royal Family. He had more than 50 children from 22 wives. However, it is understood that Osama Bin Laden had been disowned and cut off from any inheritance by the mid 1990s because of his links to terrorism. His eldest son Abdullah is understood to run an advertising agency in Saudi Arabia and has no links to extremism. A spokesperson for Coutts, pictured, said they have they 'ever looked after the financial affairs of Osama Bin Laden or his immediate family' Bin Laden was stripped of his Saudi citizenship in 1994. He had at least five wives, but was only living with three of them when he killed by US Special Forces in Pakistan. It is understood that he had at least 20 children. Coutts has catered for the Royal Family since 1692 and in recent decades has encouraged 'new money'. The Beatles, Sting, and Sir Elton John are understood to have opened accounts there. But its closely guarded reputation has been tainted in more recent years. It was fined £8.75million in 2012 for ‘serious and systematic’ failings when handling money from suspected criminals or foreign despots. City regulators criticised the bank for taking ‘an unacceptable risk of handling the proceeds of crime’. Between 2007 and 2010 staff at the bank failed to check the source of funds when prospective clients tried to open accounts. As a result, money could have come from high-risk countries including Libya, Syria and Zimbabwe.","Coutts closed their Cayman Islands office and was shipping files to Geneva .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Missing: Andrew Ian Wyatt was last seen two weeks ago leaving a lodge near Nelson, South Island, New Zealand . Mountain rescuers searching for a British hiker in New Zealand have recovered a body at the bottom of a cliff, police have said. Andrew Ian Wyatt, 41, thought to be from Cornwall, was last seen leaving a lodge in Nelson Lakes National Park near the city of Nelson in the country's south island on December 15. The body, which has yet to be formally identified, was found below the 330ft  Lake Constance Bluff - part of Mr Wyatt's intended tramping trail. New Zealand police said bad weather had prevented the expert alpine searchers from accessing the area earlier. Four ground teams, one dog team and a communications team were then flown by helicopter to the region to begin the search. Search co-ordinator Constable Dave Cogger said he was in daily contact with Mr Wyatt's parents in the UK who were extremely concerned for their son's welfare. Mr Wyatt arrived in New Zealand on November 21 with the intention of walking the Te Araroa Trail - a 1,860-mile tramping trail which links routes from Cape Reinga to Bluff. On the day he went missing he left the Blue Lake Hut about 6am local time to walk to Waiau Pass. The area between the last sighting of Mr Wyatt and his next intended destination was 'one of the more remote and difficult parts' of the trail, the training officer for Search and Rescue Nelson said. Sherp Tucker told local paper the Sunday Star Times: 'It's rugged, it's remote and the weather can change so much. 'It's a frequent place for the rescue helicopter to go to beacon activations for people who are hurt.'

"By . Leon Watson . Fears emerged today that the deadly MERS illness may have spread in the U.S. after it was revealed a patient spent at least four hours in a busy hospital waiting to be seen. Authorities said the second U.S. patient to be diagnosed with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome was made to wait at Dr P Phillips Hospital in Orlando, Florida. Almost eight more hours passed before staff at Orlando's Dr. P. Phillips Hospital determined the patient had traveled from Saudi Arabia, where he worked at a hospital, began to suspect his exposure to MERS and had him moved to an isolation room, the hospital's chief quality control officer said. Scroll down for video . Deadly: MERS belongs to the coronavirus family that also includes the common cold and SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome . The man is at Dr. P. Phillips Hospital in Orlando. He arrived there with relatively mild symptoms, is stable and doing well . MERS is a virus from the same family as . SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which killed around 800 . people worldwide after it first appeared in China in 2002. Like SARS, the virus causes a lung infection, coughing and breathing difficulties, and a temperature. Additionally, MERS can also lead to rapid kidney failure. There are no vaccines or antiviral treatments for MERS, and the disease kills approximately 30 per cent of those infected. According to recent WHO figures, 496 MERS cases have been detected since September 2012. The Saudi Arabia Health Ministry confirmed that 463 of these cases have been in the Gulf nation alone. The official, Dr. Antonio Crespo, said that as of Tuesday, he had changed procedures in the emergency department of Dr P Phillips Hospital so that any patient who comes in with flu-like symptoms will be asked whether they traveled to Saudi Arabia or other countries experiencing MERS outbreaks. 'That is one of the learning lessons of this experience. Yes, we could have asked this sooner. I think we have created more awareness,' Crespo told Reuters in an interview. The extended window of time may have exposed hospital staff and other patients to the virus, which is responsible for a worsening outbreak in Saudi Arabia and is estimated to kill about a third of infected patients. Florida officials said on Tuesday two healthcare workers who were in contact with the patient in the ER late last week had since developed flu-like symptoms and were being tested for MERS. However results published today were negative for the virus. The possibility that the illness, which has no known treatment, was spreading raised new concerns about the ability of global health officials to contain it. While the Orlando patient waited to be admitted, he was treated in a single room in the emergency department where healthcare workers wore gloves and gowns due to his diarrhea, but did not wear goggles and face masks appropriate for protecting them from the virus, Crespo said. This microscope image shows novel coronavirus particles, also known as the MERS virus, colorized in yellow . The first case, discovered in Indiana on May 2, involved a male health care worker who was living and working in Saudi Arabia who fell ill on his return to the United States . Florida officials said they were monitoring the health of 20 healthcare workers who had been in contact with the patient, including a doctor who had already left for Canada. They also were trying to track down nearly 100 people who may have overlapped with the patient at two Orlando medical facilities he visited. MERS is a respiratory illness that begins with flu-like fever and cough but can lead to shortness of breath, pneumonia and death. The White House said that President Barack Obama had been briefed on the MERS cases in the U.S. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama's team is watching the situation very closely and that the Centers for Disease Control is coordinating responses along with Florida officials. A total of 152 people have now died and . 495 have been confirmed to have contracted the virus in Saudi Arabia . since it was discovered in 2012.

"By . Gemma Champ . When you go clothes shopping, what do you look for? Most of us, if we’re honest, would say that an item’s price (closely followed by quality and fit) trumps ethical concerns about where, how and by whom it was made. Indeed, across the High Street, sales of ethical clothing have fallen thanks to their perceived high cost — Fairtrade cotton sales fell from 18 million items to 12 million between 2009 and 2010. But ethics were thrust into the spotlight again last week when a customer found a ‘hidden’ message sewn into a £10 Primark dress by what appeared to be a factory worker, reading: ‘Forced to work exhausting hours’. Troubling: Rebecca Gallagher, 25, discovered the hand-stitched protest sewn in next to the washing instructions of a Primark sundress . Hidden message: The hand-stitched note reads 'Forced to work exhausting hours' Rebecca Gallagher, 25, discovered the hand-stitched protest sewn in next to the washing instructions of a floral sundress she bought in South Wales. Primark claims ignorance of how it got there, saying there have been ‘no other incidents’, but it raises troubling questions. So, where can you buy clothes without abandoning your morals, harming the environment or paying a fortune? While numerous small companies sell genuinely Fairtrade and ethical fashion, such as fashion-conscience.com, ethicalsuperstore.com and stylewithheart.com, it is High Street stores that have the real power to make a change. No knowledge: Primark claims ignorance of how the got onto Rebecca's dress, saying there have been 'no other incidents' You will find buzzwords such as ‘sustainability’, ‘fair practice’ and ‘ethical’ scattered liberally across store websites. But finding out which companies live up to their promises is difficult, says Tamsin Lejeune, managing director and founder of the Ethical Fashion Forum, the main industry organisation for sustainable fashion. ‘Certain companies are getting pretty serious about the supply chain,’ she says. ‘But every company tends to have its own standard.’ Still, if you know where to look — and what to look for — there are places where you can buy clothes with a clear conscience. On the High Street: Many of us don't consider ethical concerns when shopping at chains such as Primark . High Street giant H&M is one of the best, despite its cheap prices. Its Conscious Collection offers affordable basics in eco-friendly fabrics, such as a shirt dress for £29.99 in Tencel(made of wood pulp), organic cotton-blend vests for £4.99 and jeans made from partly recycled material for £29.99. H&M regularly comes top of industry surveys on sustainability, and has pioneered the use of fabrics such as organic leather and recycled wool. It also features Clevercare labels, encouraging the customer to save energy by washing clothes at lower temperatures, and offers to recycle old clothes. Online giant Asos is another pioneer with Asos Africa, an ethical line made in Kenya which uses local fabrics: this season’s standouts include a £35 mesh maxi-dress and a beautiful £12 zebra-print scarf. Zara is another good bet, as it has signed up to the Ethical Trading Initiative. The campaign group Labour Behind The Label (LBL) also found in a report that Zara was in the process of raising workers’ wages to meet a ‘living wage’ benchmark. LBL spokeswoman Hannah Smith says: ‘Most people making our clothes have to choose between buying shoes for their children and having dinner. Doubling the wage of workers who make a T-shirt can cost as little as 20p per shirt — but most brands aren’t prepared to forgo even a fraction of their enormous profits.’ The report gives a very low ethical rating to brands including Armani, Versace, Hugo Boss and Gucci, based on lack of transparency and the number of subcontractors and indirect employees, who may not have as many workers’ rights. Marks & Spencer is another winner, though. It aims for workers in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India to be paid a living wage by 2015, and has strict animal welfare rules in its tanneries, refusing to sell wool from sheep that have been mulesed (a technique to prevent maggot infestation by cutting away skin near the tail, often without anaesthetic). It uses organic and Fairtrade cotton and wool in many items, from £5 vests to wool men’s suits at £349. Ethical hit: Dress by H&M . And its Shwopping initiative with Oxfam aims to reduce the number of clothes going to landfill — a billion items a year in the UK. While some stores quietly offer small lines of organic or Fairtrade T-shirts — including Laura Ashley, from about £20, and Gap, which has organic cotton childrenswear — it is at department stores that you may be most able to make informed choices. John Lewis is aiming to increase its British suppliers by 15 per cent next year and stocks brands such as Seasalt, a Cornish company that specialises in Soil Association-certified organic cotton, with Duchess of Cambridge-worthy Breton tops for £29.95. House of Fraser, meanwhile, stocks People Tree, the Fairtrade fashion pioneer beloved by Livia Firth and Emma Watson, which has dresses from about £45, with Orla Kiely-designed frocks from £75. Even without the labels of ‘organic’ and Fairtrade, you can buy more responsibly on the High Street. Take jeans: producing a  single pair uses 11,000 litres of water during manufacture, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature, polluting  rivers in countries such as China with mercury, cadmium and lead. That makes Levi’s a good buy: they have signed  up to the Better Cotton Initiative and come up with a technique for washing denim in recycled water. Buying ethical does mean savvy shopping and sometimes paying a little more. But surely it’s worth it — after all, for every bargain basement dress someone, somewhere, might be paying a heavy price.","Hidden message from a factory worker found sewn into Primark dress .

"By . Dan Bloom . Nestled among horrific footage of the Hindenburg crash and a woman imprisoned in an underground room are bizarre, forgotten pieces of history - including a 10-stone toddler. Now newsreel archive British Pathé has opened these vaults to the public, uploading all 85,000 of its films to Youtube as a gift to the public. The firm was an iconic part of British life from 1896 to 1976, when for some the dramatic black-and-white reports aired in cinemas would be their only source of news. General manager Alastair White described the films as a 'treasure trove' and said: 'Whether you’re looking for coverage of the Royal Family, the Titanic, the destruction of the Hindenburg, or quirky stories about British pastimes, it’ll be there on our channel. You can lose yourself for hours.' MailOnline has chosen 10 of the best videos from the vast collection - ranging from the horrors of the First and Second World War to when one of London's busiest junctions was saved from gridlock by a huge flyover. The most bizarre, however, must be 'Captive in a Cave', showing the underground bunker in south east London in which 28-year-old Marjorie Jordan was kept prisoner for three months. The kidnapping was only discovered when a neighbour found a note hurled over the fence. Seen around the world, images of the bomb which devastated a Japanese city and ended the Second World War still fascinated audiences two decades later. The documentary shows rare footage of bombs being made by the Americans before showing the mushroom-shaped blast and the devastation it wrought. Unusually for newsreel commentaries - which are often more caustic than presenters would dare nowadays - a respectful silence is maintained over the footage of the explosion itself. Battle and devastation dominated every second of newsreel during the First and Second World Wars, as it was often the only way of those on the Home Front seeing what happened overseas. The Pathé archive includes huge numbers of videos from the conflicts, many of which were used to shore up support for the fighting at home. This clip includes soldiers scurrying around huge guns which were used to fire shells upon enemy lines from the trenches. The Nazi airship was supposed to be a testament to the prowess of Hitler's Germany, but famously crashed and exploded during a demonstration flight in New Jersey, killing 35. This video reveals the extent of the devastation, with the flaming wreckage of the airship falling to the ground even as would-be rescuers try to help those trapped inside. The solemn narrator describes it as 'an inferno which became a flaming tomb, a twisted mass of girders, the seared and scorched skeleton of what was once a mighty airship.' Iconic in life, Marilyn Monroe enjoyed a little more privacy in death with crowds keeping at bay from a funeral organised by baseball star Joe Di Maggio. Her casket is carried out of a suburban church in Hollywood before being taken to a cemetery crypt for a deeply private service. The narrator tells audiences the ceremony had a 'dignity and simplicity denied to many Hollywood rites.' The enthusiastic narrator was hardly exaggerating when he declared: 'Dawn on the greatest day the airport ever knew. Great to be alive.' The day the Beatles arrived back at London Airport, now called Heathrow, in a plane named in their honour as fans massed on the roof has become one of the best-known incidences of Beatlemania. The narrator declares that 'even the seagulls in the nearby reservoir flew off in hysterics'. For some it may be hard to imagine the days when one Bee Gees singer could bring the young and beautiful people of London's most swinging street to a standstill. But Barry Gibb does just that, waving to crowds of 8,000 in a packed Carnaby Street as balloons are released in celebration of his being named the best-dressed celebrity of the year. Among Pathé's last cinema newsreels, the full-colour video shows Gibb arriving in a horse-drawn cart - though the hapless narrator does refer to 'The Status Quo'. The archive's more bizarre offerings include this clip of three-year-old boy Leslie Bowles. Seen with his parents in a sort of pen, Leslie sits in an armchair to cheery funfair music before someone dangles a bar of chocolate over his head. The narrator dubiously claims the child is in good health and observes: 'Nowadays he refuses to be weighed at all so we don't really know whether he's solid or hollow.' Another odd clip sees John Prentice, a self-proclaimed 'human fish' from Glasgow swimming lengths in a pool - with plates attached to his hands and feet. The claims made about him seem exaggerated, however, when he attempts what is claimed to be a miraculous leap out of the water. It may be the aged black-and-white footage, but it looks far more as though Mr Prentice simply turns over and dives to the bottom like any other swimmer. Home to London's shopping Mecca, it is one of the most heavily gridlocked junctions in the country. But the flow of traffic was once free and easy over Oxford Circus - after authorities built a bridge to allow the Tube station to be excavated below. The temporary flyover was removed, however, just as everyone had got used to it - unveiling a 'grand a spacious ticket hall ready to cope with the ebb and flow of thousands of daily commuters' in the ground below. The case of Austria's Josef Fritzl shocked the world, but it was not the first of its kind. In an unassuming Victorian villa in south east London, authorities found 28-year-old Marjorie Jordan living in a secret underground room three months after she was captured. But Miss Jordan - rescued after a neighbour found a note hurled over the fence - was never raped by her captor. Instead, a court heard labourer John Bridal forced her to help him extend the secret hole in the ground so he could use it to do his laundry.","Archives on YouTube include world events and bizarre forgotten stories .

Pictures carried by local media showed crowds of sombre and distraught men present for Ms Almanea's tragic homecoming and her funeral beneath a blazing desert sun . Police are still hunting the killer who last Tuesday morning stabbed her 16 times and left her to die as she walked home from university along a quiet footpath in a park in Colchester. She had been taking an English language course at the University of Essex since January as part of her studies for a life sciences PhD. A line of investigation is considering whether she may have been targeted because of her distinctive Muslim clothing, which included a full-length abaya robe and multi-coloured hijab headscarf.

A second man who police would like to speak to is described as white, aged between 18 and 25, with a medium build and dark hair. Police said he was seen running up Hewes Close at around 10.56am. He was wearing a long-sleeved, plain 'London Bus red' hooded top and dark trousers. Police have also previously appealed . for help to track down a man who tried to attack a jogger less than a . mile from where Ms Almanea was killed. The . white man, thought to be in his early 20s, around 5ft 7in and of medium . build with a narrow face and possibly fair hair, tried to attack the . woman in Peache Road, Colchester, at around 10pm last Thursday. Today officers continued an 'intensive' fingertip search around three fishing lakes near the footpath where Ms Almanea was killed . More than 100 police officers from Essex, Kent and the Metropolitan Police are involved in the investigation into Ms Almanea’s brutal killing, as well as profilers from the National Crime Agency. Essex Police DCI Steve Worron said . police, who are yet to find the murder weapon, are 'open-minded' about . links between the student's death and that of James Attfield. Mr . Attfield, 33, was stabbed 102 times on his arms, hands, back, neck and . head in what police described as a 'senseless and frenzied' attack in . Colchester in March.

Intensive search: Police are urging residents to look for any discarded knives or bloodstained clothing . DCI Steve Worron (pictured) said he wants to speak to a man wearing a designer jacket similar to this one . 'Our advice to people is that we have now had two knife murders in Colchester in less than three months where the motive for the attacks remains unknown,' said DCI Worron. 'Against that background we would advise everyone in the town to remain vigilant.' Police have arrested and questioned . two people this week over the murder - a 52-year-old man followed by a . 19-year-old man - but eliminated both from their enquiries. Earlier . this week police released the last known CCTV images of the victim. Police released footage believed to be Ms Almanea walking past shops in Hunwicke not long before her death .

"By . Becky Evans . More than two thirds of pregnant women believe they risk their jobs by taking maternity leave and fear competition from ambitious colleagues, according to a new study. Seven in ten women are worried about redundancy and feel their job is more vulnerable if they take statutory maternity leave after giving birth. The study by recruitment firm maternitycover.com reveals the extent of working women's concerns about the impact pregnancy has on their careers. Half of women said they would consider hiding their pregnancy from their boss if they were offered a job . Half of the 1,300 women asked said they would consider hiding their pregnancy from their boss if they were offered a new job or a promotion. The law states that women can take 26 weeks of standard maternity leave and return to their jobs. But the study shows that in the current economic climate half of women are concerned they risk their long-term career prospects by taking time off to be with their baby. Three in four working women said their prospects of a promotion worsened when they had children and one in three believed they had been passed over in favour of other colleagues because they were of childbearing age. More than two thirds of women earned less after having a baby, the study found . Paul Jenkins, chief executive of maternitycover.com, said: 'Women face countless unspoken taboos when it comes to having children and maintaining a career. 'Our survey, Boardrooms and Babies, makes this all too clear. 'We wanted to drill down into what women really experience, practically and financially, in the workplace when a baby appears on the scene. 'Only by lifting the lid in this way can we encourage conversation and improve communication between everyone involved.' Working women were polled through parenting site NetMums. The study found more than two thirds of women earned less than before having a baby and just five per cent said their salary had risen. Women on maternity leave are paid a minimum by law of 90 per cent of their weekly earnings for the first six weeks followed by at least £136 a week for 33 weeks, which is lower than the minimum wage. More than half of those polled said they returned to work sooner than they wanted to because of money worries and four out of five said they got into debt during the work break.","Poll by maternitycover.com found half feared ambitious colleagues .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Prince Harry has created a scholarship to get wounded veterans behind the wheel of an iconic Spitfire. The scheme, inspired by Second World War pilot Douglas Bader, will see the strongest candidates move up from a Tiger Mother biplane, to a Harvard, to the bespoke craft. It is the latest project launched under his charity, the Endeavour Fund, set up in 2011 with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to ensure that wounded, injured and sick . servicemen and women have the chance to rediscover themselves through . physical challenges.

Appearing at a special track day for veterans, the prince met Battle of . Britain RAF pilots, Spitfire pilot instructors and viewed a Spitfire in . the hangar at Boultbee Flight Academy at Goodwood. With . his mentoring support, the Academy is working . with Aerobility and Flying For Freedom, a non-profit organisation . partnered with Help for Heroes whose mission is to create virtual flying . schools across the UK staffed and run by the wounded, injured and sick. The candidates will be picked this summer, giving them a year to train for the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain next September. Harry, an Apache helicopter pilot, launched the scholarship by climbing into the cockpit of a Spitfire and starting it. Eric Carter, a 94-year-old veteran, said: 'I went up in that Spitfire last year. It was pretty good after 70 years — so you'd better look after it,' The Sunday Times reported. Sat in one of the revered crafts, the prince spoke to veterans and fellow pilots as he prepares to mentor a group of injured servicemen for a year . He was joined by Battle of Britain veterans at the Boultbee Flying Academy. His scholars will fly the Spitfire and other craft at the anniversary next September . Britain built about 20,000 Spitfires, but they became obsolete after the invention of the jet engine. Here, a fleet is pictured with wing commander Robert Stanford-Tuck for the 1968 film . Harry replied: 'I guarantee that us pilots now are nowhere near as good as you guys would be — but nowadays with technology the aircraft seem to have minds of their own.' John . Laity, expedition co-founder for Flying For Freedom, gave the prince a . tiny jumpsuit for his nephew, George, and told him he was going to be . the best uncle in the world. He said the prince asked him whether it was . the real thing or a onesie. RAF . Corporal Alan Robinson, 35, who is involved with Flying For Freedom, . spoke to the Prince about how the fund has helped to train servicemen to . become microlight pilots. His aim is to fly a microlight to the Antarctic, he said. The announcement came as the prince and charity patron appeared at a special track day.

The Royal footwear holder: A Goodwood track official for some reason holds on to Prince Harry's shoes which he removed to drive an Aston Martin . It does this by offering funding for new events and helping new projects with advice, hands-on support and mentoring, a spokeswoman for Kensington Palace said. So far, The Endeavour Fund has supported more than 300 men and women via projects including the Walking With The Wounded trek to the South Pole, Race2Recovery, Walk On Wales, Flying For Freedom and a Fastnet Race team. Prince Harry joined servicemen speeding around the circuit in cars including a 1964 two-series blue Aston Martin DB4, a black Lamborghini, a silver Aston Martin and a red Jaguar, a prototype F-type Coupe R. The Prince looked relaxed in jeans and a navy sweater as he mingled with participants and Goodwood officials at the special even this morning.

Among those taking was Captain Mark Jenkins, who was part of a team of four who took part in Row2Recovery, sailing from the Canary Islands to Antigua in the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge. The 34-year-old, who is part of the Royal Army Medical Corp, was joined by amputees, soldiers Cayle Royce and Scott Blaney, and fellow serviceman James Kayll. He said the project would not have been possible without a £30,000 grant from The Endeavour Fund. Capt Jenkins said they received the funds after going through a 'Dragons' Den-style' presentation. He . said: 'It's the best thing you have ever done, the hardest thing you . have ever done, the worst thing you have ever done, all in one . experience. It's hard to mentally and physically motivate yourself to . keep going.' Capt Jenkins . said the scariest moments were when their boat capsized and getting a . bit too close to a few ocean liners for comfort. He said the team were hoping to raise £100,000.

"By . Wills Robinson . The CIA inadvertently gave a terrorist leader the finances and credibility he needed to mastermind a major attack, claims a former spy. Intelligence officer Morten Storm from Denmark was asked by the CIA to build a relationship with the head of militant group Al-Shabab, the group behind September's attack, and handed over money and equipment on behalf of Western intelligence agencies to cultivate the group's trust. In 2008 he started to forge close contacts with the leader Abdukadir Mohamed Abdukadir, also known as Ikirma, in a bid to uncover information on potential targets and planned attacks. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Extremist: A former spy believes Western intelligence agencies turned Abdikadir Mohammed, also known as Ikirma, from a middle-class Kenyan into a terrorist leader . Agent: Morten Storm (left) converted to Islam after spending time in prison in Denmark. He then became involved in militant activities in Yemen and forged links with fundamentalist leaders including Anwar al-Awlaki . When Storm first met Ikrema he was a messenger for Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, an al Shabaab leader, according to a report by CNN. Their first encounter was at a Somali restaurant on the first floor of the Jamia shopping mall next door to the main mosque in Nairobi. Two other jihadists were there with Ikrema. Storm was meeting with Ikrema in order to get messages and equipment to Warsame. Storm was known to Warsame and to Ikrema as a fellow jihadist. But the relationship broke down in . 2012 when Storm left the CIA due to a ‘disagreement over a mission’ and . he now claims the plan to provide Ikirma with money and equipment may . have backfired spectacularly. He . also believes that had his relationship with the CIA not faltered he . could have helped capture or kill the man believed to have gone on to . plan the September attack on Westgate Mall. Storm converted into to Islam after spending time in prison and developed extreme jihadist views and moved to Yemen in 2001. He became trusted by fundamentalists and became involved in militant activities, including recruiting soldiers to fight in the Taliban. However he was recruited by the CIA, MI5 and the Danish intelligence service, PET, as a double agent to information on operations in Yemen and Somalia and prevent attacks in Europe. When Storm first met Ikirma, he . was only a messenger for the jihadists and was sent to pick up an electronic device from the Danish agent by one of the groups then leaders. Undercover: The former spy from Denmark was working for numerous agencies including the CIA and Denmark's PET while he was trying to infiltrate militant groups in Yemen . Storm became trusted by fundamentalists and became involved in militant activities, including recruiting soldiers to fight in the Taliban . As the relationship developed, Storm claims that the CIA, using him as a middle man, gave . him resources, equipment and the authority he needed to mastermind a . major terrorist attack, similar to the one in Nairobi which killed 67 . people. Storm, who has since retired from duty, told CNN that in March 2012 PET had offered him one million Danish krone (£125,000) to  lead them to Ikrima on behalf of the CIA. He was offered the job after he was paid £156,000 ($250,000) to meet with Anwar al-Awlaki, an Islamic militant who was killed in a drone strike in 2011. Storm said Ikrima was at the centre of a global network connecting a number of terrorist operatives in Somalia, Kenya, Yemen, and the West and had emerged as the chief handler of foreign fighters because of his language skills and level of education. Even though Storm is not aware of the exact role Ikrima played in the attack in Nairobi, he knows his track record and believes he had the capability to be one of the masterminds. The former agent also insisted he might have been given an insight into the plans had he still been working for Western intelligence, but his relationship with PET and the CIA ended in mid-2012 after a disagreement following a mission in Yemen. First appearance: Four suspects (left to right) Liban Abdullah Omar, Mohamed Abdi Ahmed, Hussein Hassan and Adan Mohamed Ibrahim stood in the dock today for a hearing at a courtroom in Nairobi accused of playing a part in the Westgate Mall bombing . Capable: Storm was not aware of the direct role Ikrima played in the Westgate Mall massacre, but believes he had the potential to mastermind such an attack . Inner workings: CNN reporter Nic Robertson's interview with Storm provides a rare insight into how an intelligence agency, like the CIA, builds relationships with terrorists . He said: 'I get really frustrated to . know that Ikrima had been maybe involved in the Westgate terrorist . attack. It frustrates me a lot because it could have been stopped and . I'm sad I can't be involved in this.' 'He was one of the smartest ones I met in east Africa.' One . of Ikrima's former associates also told CNN in Nairobi that he was the 'main . link' between Somalia and the Kenyan-based militant group Al Hijra. Now . Western counter-terorrism officials fear his reputation in Jihadist . circles worldwide will be bolstered by his escape during the U.S.Navy . SEAL operation in Somalia last week, and he is now in a position to plan . more deadly attacks in Europe and Africa. CNN reporter Nic Robertson, . who interviewed Storm, told MailOnline: 'He is frustrated because he . gave equipment and material to Ikrima which allowed him to build up his . credibility in Al-Shabab. 'When he first met him 2008, Ikrima was just a messenger in a group and now he is head of the organisation. 'Storm's . viewing is that had the CIA paid closer attention to Ikirima and had . the plans that were being put in place for Storm to keep closer tabs on . him followed through, then there would be more information on their . operations and potential targets. 'It . would have allowed Storm to develop closer contacts with Ikirma, and . would have enabled him to find out what they were thinking and what they . were planning. 'His . accounts of where he was and what he was doing has all checked out. Encrypted emails he has sent and received show he was in central . position in the relationship. Helpless: Kenya Defence Forces soldiers take their position at the Westgate shopping centre. Storm says he is frustrated knowing he could have prevented the attack . Storm . started his jihadist career in Yemen and, after he made contacts . contacted the CIA, as well as Danish security agency and MI5. Mr . Robertson added: 'Storm provides a rare opportunity to see inside . agencies. It provides a rare insight into the way that they work. 'To get closer into an organisation you need to build relationships. It can be a double-edged sword and in this case it was. 'It put a smart guy in a position of power for a very negative effect. Tragedy: A man whose relative was killed during the massacre is carried out by hospital staff . 'Storm believes the attacks could have been thwarted. He is not involved in this anymore so he doesn't know if Ikrima actually had a direct role. 'But he knows Ikirma's track record. Storm was seen as an important connection who could move between their worlds in Yemen and Somalia and the rest of the world.' Ikrima is believed to be able to . speak five languages - Norwegian, Swahili, Arabic, Somali, and English - . which puts him in a position of authority in Al-Shabab. Now said to be in his late twenties he was born into a middle class Somalian family in Mombassa, Kenya. His family then moved to Nairobi where the young Ikrima excelled at school in the languages, including French. After a successful education, he traveled to Norway in 2004, because of the potential economic opportunities in Europe, and took advantage of his Somali ethnicity which allowed him to apply for refugee status. Despite being given documents to stay in the country, he did not fit in and started to become radicalised. Just four years later, he left Europe and returned to East Africa. It is also believed Ikrima spent some time in Britain and lived in London for between six and 12 months. The CIA would not comment on the story and PET said they could neither confirm or deny they knew Storm.","Morten Storm was an informant for intelligence agencies for five years .

"By . Chris Pleasance . With millions of pounds in the bank, you might have thought the world's super-rich wouldn't have a care in the world. But a new survey has revealed the top fears of the world's wealthiest people, and one of the most common is that their money is their children's ambition and drive to do well. For the most successful - defined as those with fortunes of $10million (£5.9million) and above - worries about children's motivation came second only to worries about their own health. Sting said his kids will not inherit his £180million fortune as the money will be an 'albatross around their necks' According to the study, by law firm Withersworldwide, fears over . children's ambition come above worries about investments failing, . inability to provide for the family, and even divorce. Among those with a fortune of less than $10million the fear still ranked highly, but came in fourth place, behind health troubles and worries over income. The study found that, wealthy families have the most to fear from third generation family members when it comes to losing the family millions. Sara Cormack, a partner at Wither's, said: 'If the first generation are wealth creators then the second generation tend to be wealth preservers, but it is the third generation that families are most worried about. 'If they have had everything put on a plate for them without seeing any of the hard graft that goes into creating that wealth, then they can lose track of how best to use that wealth and how ifficult it was to build up in the first place.' Former Police lead singer and musician Sting has today said he will not be passing on any of his £180million fortune to his children because he wants them to earn their money themselves. He said: ‘I told them there won’t be much money left because we are spending it! We have a lot of commitments. What comes in, we spend, and there isn’t much left. Nigella Lawson previously said that not having to earn their own money 'ruins people' while Brooklyn Beckham was encouraged to get a job earning £2.68 an hour in a coffee shop by David and Victoria . ‘I certainly don’t want to leave them trust funds that are albatrosses round their necks. ‘They have to work. All my kids know that and they rarely ask me for anything, which I really respect and appreciate. ‘Obviously, if they were in trouble I would help them, but I’ve never really had to do that. They have the work ethic that makes them want to succeed on their own merit.’ Celebrity chef Nigella Lawson also said that her children will not be passed any of her own fortune, adding that 'it ruins people not having to earn their own money.' According to reports, Brooklyn Beckham recently got a job in a West London coffee shop earning £2.68 an hour after being encouraged to do it by parents David and Victoria, who are worth an estimated £165million. The data, a rare insight into the minds of the world's most powerful, was based on surveys of more than 4,500 and interviews with 16 very wealthy families from Europe, Asia and North America. Families interviewed said they were using charitable donations or setting up a new business to give the family a renewed sense of direction. Some even said they had drawn up a family statement, similar to a business statement, in order to give the next generation a purpose and something to achieve.","Survey looked at top fears of 4,500 of the world's wealthiest families .

"By . Chris Brooke . Sam Baker was told by doctors that once the life-support tube was removed from her baby’s mouth, he would probably carry on breathing for a minute, an hour or maybe even a day. Surrounded by family in the hospice the 20-year-old mother cradled one-month-old meningitis victim Harrison and prayed for a miracle as the ventilator was switched off. She said: ‘I just sat in the chair holding him and I kept stroking his face and telling him how much I loved him as my tears rolled down on to his little chest. It was heart breaking. Harrison Ellmer (pictured with his parents Samantha Baker and Adam Ellmer) contracted meningitis when he was just three-weeks-old. Doctors thought he could not be saved so he was taken to a hospice . Harrison's life support machine was turned off but he continued to breathe and was soon well enough to return home. He has been left deaf in one ear and with mild cerebral palsy . ‘We all sat in silence, crying, urging him to keep breathing.’ Harrison began ‘coughing and choking’ as the tube was removed. As minutes past, doctors warned Miss Baker and the child’s father Adam Ellmer against raising their expectations. Miss Baker explained: ‘I could see he was getting stronger but we didn’t want to get our hopes up. ‘The doctors had told us that even if . Harrison did live he would probably be so badly brain damaged he would . just lie there unable to function. ‘But as each hour went on he seemed . to brighten and respond more and so I started to breast feed him and he . accepted it. From then on he got better and he’s just our perfect little . boy now.’ Harrison was born healthy but became ill a few weeks later and had to be taken by ambulance to Rotherham Hospital where he was resuscitated . Fearing that he would die, Harrison's parents had him christened while he was in hospital . Hope continued to grow until, against all the odds, Harrison was eventually returned to hospital and discharged ten days later. Speaking from her home in North . Anston, South Yorkshire, Miss Baker said: ‘What happened was every mum’s . nightmare – to be told you are taking your little boy somewhere to die. ‘We were told there was nothing more that could be done for Harrison and he would have to be taken off his life-support machine. ‘They told us it might be nicer to take him to the children’s hospice because it was a better place to say goodbye to him. ‘I couldn’t get my head round the fact that I was taking my lovely little boy somewhere to die. ‘Even when the doctors had given up . hope I had something inside me that said it wasn’t Harrison’s time and . he would live and he proved me right and pulled through.’ After Harrison had been in hospital for six days doctors told his parents that there was nothing more they could do for him and he was transferred to the Bluebell Wood Children's Hospice . Harrison's mother, Samantha Baker, said that when she took him home from the hospital it was the happiest moment of her life and that it was likely taking him home for the first time all over again . Ms Baker said that she now sees her son as a 'little miracle'. Harrison is pictured in hospital with his parents and grandmother . Harrison has been left deaf in one . ear and with mild cerebral palsy that slightly restricts his movement on . one side, but is otherwise healthy and Miss Baker describes him as ‘my . perfect little boy’. Harrison was born in January and was . ‘pumped full of antibiotics’ when tests confirmed that he was suffering . from type B meningitis  –the most common form of the brain virus – and . septicaemia. As his condition deteriorated he was . transferred to Sheffield Children’s Hospital before he was taken to . Bluebell Wood Hospice – suffering from fits and unable to breathe alone. Miss Baker said: ‘We count every day . as a blessing. Harrison is just a happy smiling, cheerful baby who never . cries. He’s babbling and rolling over and developing normally.’ His father Adam, a pipe fitter, said: . ‘It’s been a really difficult time and Sam has been fantastic. It was . great to bring Harrison home again, he is such a lovely happy little . lad.’ Harrison's parents have now raised more than £5,000 for the Bluebell Wood Children's Hospice .

"By . Mark Prigg . Nasa has revealed an astonishing image of a giant solar 'whip' on the surface of the sun captured as a solar flare erupted. The amazing image, captured on May 3rd, shows a solar prominence, a loop of red hot plasma which remains attached to the sun, and appeared just as a solar flare was subsiding. Experts say it is another sign the sun is 'waking up' as it approaches its 11 year solar maximum, which is due later this year. A burst of solar material leaps off the left side of the sun in what is known as a prominence eruption. This image combines three images from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory captured on May 3, 2013, at 1:45 pm EDT, just as an M-class solar flare from the same region was subsiding. A solar prominence is a large, bright feature . extending outward from the Sun's surface. A prominence forms over . timescales of about a day, and the red-glowing looped material is plasma, a hot gas comprised of . electrically charged hydrogen and helium. An erupting prominence occurs when such a . structure becomes unstable and bursts outward, releasing the plasma. The loop was created as the sun shot out a solar flare towards Earth. This flare is classified as an M5.7-class flare. M-class flares are the . weakest flares that can still cause some space weather effects near . Earth. Increased numbers of flares are quite common at the moment, as . the sun's normal 11-year activity cycle is ramping up toward solar . maximum, which is expected in late 2013, Nasa said. 'Increased numbers of flares are quite common at the moment, since the sun's normal 11-year cycle is ramping up toward solar maximum, which is expected in late 2013,' Nasa has said. Humans have tracked this solar cycle continuously since it was discovered, and it is normal for there to be many flares a day during the sun's peak activity, Nasa said. It claims the danger form the flare shown here has already passed. The solar prominence is clearly visible on this full disc image of the sun captured by Nasa's SDO spacecraft. 'Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. 'Harmful . radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to . physically affect humans on the ground, however -- when intense enough . -- they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and . communications signals travel.

A local resident speaking to KCBS lamented the chaos. ‘Don’t disrespect, you know, buses and breaking stuff, breaking glass, throwing [bottles] and disrespecting the law,’ Priscila Bautista said. ‘That is not right.’ A police advisory issued just before 6.00 p.m. demanded the celebration break up immediately, but was likely not seen by the revelers. ‘Fans celebrating Mexico’s win are reminded to obey all laws,’ the police wrote on Nixle. ‘Pedestrians MUST stay out of the street.’ One of the fans partying in the street told KTLA ‘it was the best game ever.’ It took police more than two hours to finally bring the crowd under control and move it out of the busy street, according to KCBS. The freeway ramp closures were put in place on Van Nuys Boulevard, Osborne Street and Terra Bella Street, according to the California Highway Patrol. El Tri’s next World Cup match will be this Sunday. The team will face the Netherlands. Mexico has reached the last 16 of every World Cup tournament since 1994. Woohoo!

"By . Darren Boyle . A retired murder squad detective who attended the scene of 'body in the bag spy' Gareth Williams said he believed the MI6 man could have been poisoned. Former Detective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton was the most senior officer on the scene when he arrived at Mr Williams' flat in Pimlico on August 23, 2010. An inquest at Westminster Coroner Court found Mr Williams was most likely 'unlawfully killed', but police officially believe the spy died after padlocking himself inside the bag. Former Detective Chief Inspector Clive Sutton, pictured, said he believed the death of Gareth Williams could have been 'the perfect murder' Police investigating Gareth Williams' death, left, discovered a large amount of women's clothing including a red wig having from a chair on the front room of his Pimlico flat, right . Former DCI Colin Sutton was on the scene in Pimlico in London when Mr Williams' body was removed . Gareth Williams was on secondment to MI6 from GCHQ when he died leading to fears he may have been killed because of his job . Coroner Fiona Wilcox ruled that the spy would not have . been able to lock himself in the bag and was therefore likely to have . died at somebody else's hands. She concluded: 'The cause of his death . was unnatural and likely to have been criminally mediated. I am . therefore satisfied that on the balance of probabilities that Gareth was . killed unlawfully.' However, speaking about the case, former DCI Sutton told The Sun he thought the flat was unusually warm when he arrived, claiming the heating was turned up to its maximum setting, possibly to assist with decomposition. He said: 'If he had been poisoned, then the chemical compounds might have vanished by the time toxicology results were conducted.' The inquest had heard that there had been significant delays between the report of Mr Williams' disappearance and the eventual discovery of his body in his flat, leading to fears of a possible cover up. According to Mr Sutton if some unusual form of poison had been used it would have been difficult to detect. He added: ' I remain convinced the flat was tidied up after his death. that may have been to protect national security or it might have been something more sinister. If that's the case, then it could have been the perfect murder.' Scotland Yard chiefs said they thought Gareth Williams died alone – but were forced to admit that gaps in the evidence made it impossible to be sure. His furious parents rejected that verdict and said they stood by a coroner’s ruling that the brilliant codebreaker was probably killed unlawfully. They also accused MI6 of allowing the circumstances of his death to be covered up. Police investigating Mr Williams' death found CCTV footage of him using Holland Park Tube station nine days before his body was discovered . The body of the 31-year-old lay undiscovered in a red holdall in the bath of his Pimlico flat for a week before security service bosses raised the alarm. Significantly, ten to 15 DNA traces found in the apartment are still unidentified, despite the efforts of leading forensic experts. Police have also been unable to explain why his DNA was not on the lock on the bag and his prints were not found on the rim of the bath. In a statement, Mr Williams’ parents Ian and Ellen said: ‘We are naturally disappointed it is still not possible to state with certainty how Gareth died, and the fact that the circumstances of his death are still unknown adds to our grief. We consider that on the basis of the facts at present known, the coroner’s verdict accurately reflects the circumstances of Gareth’s death. ‘We still, however, remain very disappointed over the failure of his employers at MI6 to take even the most basic inquiries concerning Gareth’s welfare when he failed to attend for work on August 16, 2010.’ ‘If proper steps had been taken in the same manner as any reasonable employer would have undertaken, further information relating to the cause of his death might have become apparent and not have been lost due to the length of time before Gareth’s body was found.’ Mr Williams’ naked body was found on August 23, 2010. Police released a photograph of this lock which was similar to the arrangement used on the bag containing Mr Williams' body where they discovered 'two minor components of another contributor's DNA' During Mr Williams' inquest, a yoga expert failed to lock himself inside an identical bag without any outside assistance . Dr Wilcox said it ‘remained a legitimate line of inquiry’ that the secret services may have been involved – and Mr Williams was probably killed unlawfully by a third party. But Martin Hewitt, a deputy assistant commissioner in the Metropolitan Police, insisted his investigation showed Mr Williams probably locked himself inside the bag without help. He admitted however that ‘evidential contradictions and gaps in our understanding’ meant no theory – police or coroner’s – could be proved ‘beyond all reasonable doubt’. Scotland Yard accepted that its investigation had been flawed from the outset. Detectives were unable to access the spy’s personnel and vetting files and formally interview GCHQ and MI6 staff until after the inquest because all liaison with MI6 was carried out through the counter-terrorism squad. But Mr Hewitt said it was ‘beyond credibility’ that the secret services had covered up the death. ‘I do not believe that I have had the wool pulled over my eyes,’ he said. ‘I believe that what we are dealing with is a tragic unexplained death. ‘I am absolutely satisfied that every question we have had to ask has been asked, and every person we felt it necessary to talk to we have spoken to. ‘No evidence has been identified to establish the full circumstances of Gareth’s death beyond all reasonable doubt. ‘With the conclusion of the investigation, the Metropolitan Police’s position is that, on balance, it is a more probable conclusion that there was no other person present when Gareth died. I’m convinced that Gareth’s death was in no way related to his work.’ Mr Hewitt . added: ‘We didn’t get it right at the beginning and the way that we did . it was cumbersome and didn’t allow us to do the investigation in the way . that we wanted to. 'We . recognised that fact and we changed it fundamentally for the subsequent . two years of the investigation. I don’t think that process stopped us . getting any evidence that we needed to get.’ 'Three years of extensive . investigative activity have developed a very clear profile of Gareth. He . was, without doubt, a private person who was very close to his family . and had few other close friends. 'That . said, the universal view of colleagues was of a conscientious and . decent man with a few well-known hobbies such as his cycling and . climbing. There is no evidence of any animosity towards Gareth, and it . has not been possible to identify anyone with a motive for causing him . harm.' The investigation included interviews with 27 officials from both MI6 and GCHQ, from where Mr Williams, who was originally from Anglesey, had been seconded. Police said that Dr Wilcox has accepted their findings, but decided that there is insufficient new evidence to justify re-opening the inquest.","Gareth Williams was found locked in a sports bag in his flat in August 2010 .

"By . Ryan Lipman . Opera singer Tamar Iveri has been dumped by Opera Australia over homophobic comments posted on her Facebook page . A soprano has been dumped by Opera Australia after she was accused of labelling homosexuals 'sewage' and 'fecal masses' on her Facebook page more than a year ago. The company confirmed on Monday that Georgian singer Tamar Iveri, set to star in its production of Verdi's Otello, had been released immediately from her contract. Iveri was to have played the lead part of Desdemona in the opera, scheduled to open on July 5. A post on Iveri's Facebook page against a gay pride march in her Georgian home city had brought widespread condemnation, with patrons sharing their outrage on social media and Opera Australia sponsor Qantas expressing its concern. 'I was quite proud of the fact how Georgian society spat at the parade ... Please, stop vigorous attempts to bring West's 'fecal masses' in the mentality of the people by means of propaganda,' read Iveri's comments, which were taken down shortly after they were posted. The singer has since blamed her zealous Christian husband, Raul Tskhadadze, for posting the comments in her name, saying he had found an article she had been writing about recent gay pride protests, changed it and posted it under her name. In a statement, Opera Australia said the opinions posted were 'unconscionable', and it acknowledged Iveri had apologised at the weekend. 'Opera Australia has agreed with Tamar Iveri, to immediately release her from her contract with the company,' the statement reads. 'Ms Iveri and her husband have both made public statements in the last 48 hours with regards to comments attributed to Ms Iveri. She has unreservedly apologised for those comments and views. 'Opera Australia believes the views as stated to be unconscionable.' Opera Australia's decision was supported on its Facebook page with observers unanimously approving of Iveri's sacking. Iveri denied writing the comments and has said they were written by her husband . Iveri, pictured with her husband Raul Tskhadadze . The opera singer has previously taken to Facebook to hit out at claims she was homophobic, as reported by the Australian media. 'For my entire career I have been working with gay people and some of them are very dear friends,' she posted. 'All of them can confirm that I never lost a word that might associate me with homophobic ideas. I respect every single human being and I am against all kind of discrimination and violence'. Iveri goes on to explain to context of the post that was made on her Facebook account. She points out that on May 17, 2013, 'a gay parade was supposed to pass directly in the yard of an Orthodox Church in Tiflis', the capital of Georgia. 'At the same place and for the same date a commemoration for Georgian soldiers killed in Afghanistan had been announced. 'For that reason and because Georgia is a country where 90 per cent of the population are deeply religious, conservative Orthodox Christians I wanted to express my sincere doubts that a parade made sense under these circumstances, in the yard of an Orthodox church. 'I was worried that this would provoke people and lead to violence. Unfortunately this is what happened then.' The soprano has previously taken to Facebook to deny she is homophobic . The opera singer explains that her husband was also using her Facebook account and that he is deeply religious and has a 'tough attitude towards gay people' 'He copied my text, changed it considerably and posted it under my name. You might imagine that I was not happy with that at all and I immediately deleted it when I saw the text about half an hour later. 'This text does not express my own opinion. I'm afraid it was too late and the text was already spreading in the internet. Iveri said she explained the post and officially apologized to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community in Georgia a year ago and her apology was accepted and she also denied writing a letter to the Georgian president about the issue. An Opera Australia spokeswoman said it had been important for the company to take some time to understand fully what had been said, and to exercise due diligence. She said if Opera Australia failed to do so, it would be acting in a discriminatory way and 'we value fairness for all'. 'Having now taken this time, Opera Australia believes the views expressed by Tamar Iveri to be unconscionable, and has therefore taken action to part ways. 'We have all felt this to be emotional and disturbing and have sought to bring this situation to a resolution as fairly and quickly as possible.' Iveri, pictured far right, will no longer star in the leading role of Desdemona in its production of Verdi's Otello . On Monday, Iveri shared Facebook a post by her husband Raul Tskhadadze, written at about midday Monday, in which he broke his silence to address 'mushrooming pathos and hatred' in the media about the post. 'For me it is hard to watch how affected she (Iveri) is, and watch how people are damaging my most precious person's reputation and her peace of mind due to which she had no share of the underlying,' the post reads. Mr Tskhadadze has taken all responsibility for the post written last year, in a Facebook post yesterday, which was shared by his wife . Mr Tskhadadze claims to have been responsible for the Facebook post, which caused the 'stir'. 'At that time we used a common Facebook profile, at the same time, I thought to use Tamar's popularity, and to reached (sic) my voice to numerous audience I published a letter on her behalf,' he posted. 'The letter was signed on our Facebook page, when Tamar returned home she erased the letter and got very upset. However, a few minutes were enough for people and for Georgian press.' Mr Tskhadadze said news of the post was spread by the Georgian press, which nearly cost him 'the price of a loss of personal happiness'. He said his wife did not initially disclose that the letter was not written by her. 'She had endured and suffered a lot because of the letter which I wrote. Tamar has never been homophobic and especially not against western values,' the post reads. Mr Tskhadadze then explains why he wrote the post, in light of the funeral of the Georgian soldiers killed in Afghanistan, one which was his best friend. He said a gay march at the same churchyard where the funeral was taking place 'seemed a provocation' and such reports were spread all over Georgia. 'I believe that society should be naturally tolerant toward people of different sexual orientation, and at the same time people can express their will for freedom, and I thought I could express the fact that someone may not agree with the idea of gay people’s demonstration on the streets.' Having lived in Europe for a 'few years', he concludes by making comparisons between Georgian and European consciousness and that Georgia is still not ready for some European culture in daily life. 'That is what I wanted to say in the letter. However, I regret that it was not entirely clear... and by this letter I have caused many trouble for my lovely wife and also for myself.' He finished by stating he understands his responsibility and publicly declares he is to blame for the post on May 17, 2013 and that 'all the damage should be on myself'. 'It is unbearable to me that the year later, when her (Iveri's) explanation and apology after the incident is over in Georgia, released articles in the foreign press again caused controversy around this delicate issue,' the post ends. In the post, Mr Tskhadadze apologies for damage he has caused to his wife's reputation .","Opera singer Tamar Iveri dumped by Opera Australia .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Daily Mail Reporter . A teenager killed his grandmother in a bloody struggle inside her home at a nudist community in Florida and then drove around with her body in a minivan for nearly five hours, authorities said. Brandon Machetto, 18, had been living with his grandmother, 74-year-old Sylvia Schmitt, for the past several weeks and they apparently fought frequently, said Pasco County sheriff's spokeswoman Melanie Snow. A neighbor called authorities after seeing Machetto drag a wrapped bag with feet dangling out from the home - Paradise Lakes Condominium Association nudist community in Lutz - into his grandmother's minivan early Monday, police said. Troubled: Brandon Machetto, 18, has been charged with the murder of his grandmother. Police have not yet said how Sylvia Schmitt, 74, died, but her body was found in the back of her Honda minivan in Lutz, Florida . Victim: Sylvia Rosalie Schmitt, 74, was described as a very approachable woman who never spoke badly of anyone. She was allegedly murdered by her grandson . The body of Sylvia Schmitt was found in her gold Honda Odyssey (right) and there was a significant amount of blood found in her home, suggesting a struggle . Machetto drove around with his . grandmother's body in the back of the Honda Odyssey and when deputies . tried to pull him over, he refused, police said. He eventually drove back to the Paradise Lakes - a clothing-optional condominium community and adjacent resort - and was arrested. Machetto was charged with first-degree murder and is being held in jail without bond. It's unclear if he has an attorney. Deputies described Machetto as expressionless and stoic following his arrest. However he then pulled a huge smile when it came time for his booking photo. In a second photo, taken moments later, he appears to be on the verge of tears. Ronnie Hall, Machetto's martial arts instructor for seven years, said Machetto nearly died a few years ago when he was attacked by a group of teens who hit him in the back of the head with a rock, the Tampa Bay Times reported. The Paradise Lakes Condominium Association is a nudist community in Lutz, Florida . Schmitt reportedly had her troubled grandson come and live with her at Paradise Lakes because his mother 'had done all she could' Hall said Machetto suffered a brain injury as a result and was 'never the same' afterwards. Machetto's emotional maturity was that of a 13-year-old. Hall said Machetto was spastic and child-like. Machetto and his grandmother apparently fought as she tried to get her grandson to take his medication. Deputies said Machetto had been accused of domestic violence against Schmitt in 2012, but she dropped the charge. Schmitt had taken Machetto in to live with her several weeks ago after his mother, Sheryl, 'had done all she could'. Records show he was arrested twice earlier this year. In March he was charged with obstructing police and resisting arrest. In May he was arrested for retail theft.","Brandon Machetto, 18, has been charged with the murder of his grandmother, Sylvia Schmitt, 74 .

"By . Richard Spillett . An England fan who was caught on TV apparently flirting with a Brazilian woman at the World Cup has denied he was 'chatting her up'. Carl Wenz was at England's opening match with Italy on Saturday when TV cameras filmed him holding a mobile phone as he spoke to a female Brazilian fan.

Scroll down for video . Rumbled: Carl Wenz was seen by millions of TV viewers chatting to a Brazilian woman on Saturday . The images were shared more than 2,000 times on Twitter, with the tagline accompanying the photo reading 'LAD: An England fan asks for this Brazilian fan's phone number mid-match'. Twitter users joked that his 'other half' would go mad after seeing him cosying up to 'the enemy', with Tony Scott writing: 'Hope his girlfriend/wife's not watching!' A website user called the Spin Doctor added: 'I wonder if his wife back home will mind?' and Ronnie MacKay wrote: 'What goes on in Brasil, stays in Brasil. Play by the rules boys!' But butcher and avid England fan Mr Wenz has told his local newspaper that he is . always keen to talk to locals in the countries he visits while following . the team.

"By . Bianca London . She’s just won her seventh grand slam and is hoping to secure her eighth major title at Wimbledon but it seems that the poster girl of tennis is already getting excited about starting a family. Speaking to MailOnline about her future, 27-year-old Maria Sharapova, who is currently dating Bulgarian tennis ace Grigor Dimitrov, said: 'I would like to play tennis for as long as I enjoy playing, but family is really important for me so we’ll see.' For now, the Russian tennis star, who is ranked world No. 5 by the Women's Tennis Association, is focusing on her performance at Wimbledon. Tennis ace: Maria Sharapova, 27, is still dominating the world of tennis after just winning the French Open - and she's even landed herself a starring role in Rizzle Kicks' new music video . Speaking about preparing for huge tournaments, she said: 'Every tournament is an opportunity, but . grand slams require a lot of preparation and hard work. 'I train as much . as I can and maintain a good diet to keep me fit and healthy, but . getting in the mindset is important too. 'When you step out onto the . court, you are fully aware of the spectators around you, so it’s easy to . channel their energy and enthusiasm to boost your performance. The buzz . from the crowd is very encouraging.' Clearly her training and commitment is paying off, she just won the French . Open, which she describes as the most recent high point of her career. High point: Maria says that Wimbledon is the natural home of tennis and is steeped in tradition, so winning there and becoming a part of that tradition was 'truly special' However, she says that winning her first Grand . Slam at Wimbledon in 2004 was 'undoubtedly' her greatest achievement. 'Winning your first Grand Slam is always . special, but Wimbledon is the natural home of tennis and is steeped in . tradition, so winning there and becoming a part of that tradition was . truly special. Any low point can be when you know you aren't performing . to your ability,' she said. Maria explains that keeping her health in check is one of the most important aspects of her training regime and she has a straight forward approach to clean living. She said: 'I wouldn’t say my diet is crazily strict . at all. Keeping healthy is honestly very simple: everything in . moderation. 'My team has emphasised time and time again the importance of . keeping hydrated when training and competing, so I try to get as much . mineral water into my regime as I can.' She scrubs up well! Maria describes her personal style as simple and easy and cites 'effortlessly elegant' Audrey Hepburn as her all-time style icon . When she isn't training or playing, she aims to get as much rest as possible. Speaking about how she unwinds in her free time, she said: 'Rest is very important for me, and this . can simply be quiet time at home, but I love taking a couple of friends . and going to dinner. 'Something indulgent - even if you have to spend a . bit more money than you would normally - really helps relieve stress!' While tennis is, of course, her first love, she says that she likes to maintain a bit of variety in her daily life by doing 'as many things as she can' such as yoga or pilates to keep herself 'full of . energy'. As well as being a top athlete, Maria has lent her good looks to the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue and modelled for Nike, Prince, and Canon, but prefers to take a natural approach to beauty. 'I think natural is the best way to go,' she said. 'For me, keeping skin looking healthy and full of vitality is the most . fundamental ingredient for a good look.' Empire: Maria also runs her Sugarpova candy line and is the brand ambassador for Porche, as well as Evian's Live Young campaign . While she prefers a stripped back approach to beauty, she confesses that fashion is her 'guilty pleasure'. 'I adore dressing up - certainly a guilty pleasure for me! I love vintage stores. My personal style is simple and easy and Audrey Hepburn is my all-time style icon. She was utterly gorgeous but effortlessly elegant at the same time. She was a true icon,' she said. On top of winning tennis tournaments, running her Sugarpova candy line and being the brand ambassador for Porche, as well as Evian's Live Young campaign, Maria has just teamed up with Brighton-born chart-topping musicians Rizzle Kicks to star in their latest video.

"By . Mark Duell . A 15-year-old schoolgirl has vowed never to take legal highs again after revealing she suffers panic attacks and anxiety from a drug known as 'Blue Cheese'. Paige Smith, of Colchester, Essex, said she bought the drug - which is legally available to over-18s - without ID from a shop in the town after friends introduced her to legal highs five months ago. She became addicted and spent more than £200 buying the brightly-packaged recreational drugs over the counter before she was taken to hospital after feeling ‘instantly weird and shaky’. Panic attacks: Paige Smith (left), of Colchester, Essex, said she bought the drug Blue Cheese (right) - which is legally available to over-18s - without ID from a shop after friends introduced her to legal highs . Paige, who has had counselling, called for the drug to be banned, saying: ‘I felt instantly weird and shaky and my tongue felt like it was disappearing. I was crying a lot and terrified, so I called my mum. ‘When I read about that girl left in hospital I realised how lucky I was. You don't know what goes in these things - there are no ingredients and you could get ill or, in the worst case, die.’ Legal highs range from herbal highs, synthetic highs and mixtures of the two. The Association of Chief Police Officers said they are designed to produce the same or similar effects to illegal stimulant drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy but are not controlled under legislation. It is illegal to sell them for human consumption, so they are marketed as research chemicals, plant food, bath crystals, pond cleaner or souvenir cannabis seeds. An A&E consultant at Colchester General Hospital in Essex this week said he had treated four teenagers who had collapsed in recent weeks. All had taken legal highs. An all-party parliamentary group was set up to examine regulation of legal highs and experts say the legislation is 40 years out of date. Experts also believe when the next set of tests are carried out many being sold in shops in Essex will contain substances which are either illegal or are so harmful they will be banned. Paige has vowed to never touch the legal highs again but said her friends continue to use them. Her mother Heidi Thorpe, 34, said: ‘When I found out what she was doing I wasn't impressed. Before this she was so outgoing and I'd have trouble keeping her in. But she's so nervous now she won't even leave the house.’ It is illegal to sell legal highs to under-18s, but Paige said she was never asked for ID - a claim denied by the owner of Sheppards, the shop where she bought the drug in Colchester. Paige added: ‘The first drug I took was Black Mamba, which felt trippy and gave me the giggles. I kept coming back to it. 'We would take it in the daytime outside Firstsite (a Colchester art gallery), or walking around town. I had no problem buying them and I don't look 18 without make up on.’ She said she ignored warnings saying ‘not for human consumption’ because she heard it was simply a way of making the drugs legal for sale. Black Mamba was taken off the shelves at Sheppards before it was made into a Class B illegal drug in February. Essex Police urged people to report claims of underage service. Sergeant Sue Richardson said: ‘We are aware of the issue and remain concerned. We are working with Trading Standards.’","Paige Smith bought 'Blue Cheese' over the counter with no ID .

"By . Associated Press . Former Good Morning America host Joan Lunden has announced that she has breast cancer. She revealed her diagnosis on Tuesday's edition of the ABC morning show, which she co-hosted from 1980 through 1997. She spoke with GMA host Robin Roberts, who has also been treated for breast cancer recently, as has GMA co-host Amy Robach. Lunden said her treatment will include surgery and radiation. She said she's already started chemotherapy. Scroll Down for Video . Brave: Joan Lunden told viewers on Good Morning America that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer . Support: GMA host Robin Roberts, herself a cancer survivor speaks to Joan Lunden on Tuesday morning's GMA show where the former host revealed her own cancer diagnosis . She said after the initial shock of the diagnosis, she resolved to learn everything she can about the illness and go into what she called 'warrior mode.' The 63-year-old Lunden is now a health and wellness advocate. She has written eight books . Lunden's treatment for her cancer, which she has described as 'aggressive' will include lumpectomy surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. She has said that she is expecting to make a full recovery from the tumor in her right breast which was discovered during her annual ultrasound. 'I sat there stunned – how could this be? I considered myself fit and healthy, I get checked faithfully every year and I didn’t have a history of breast cancer in my family,' Lunden wrote on her blog about diagnosis. 'But of course after covering many stories about breast cancer over the years, I knew that none of us are exempt. 'I also knew that I had to jump into action quickly, put together a team, and find the best course of treatment for the kind of cancer that I have.' Not alone: Robin Roberts told Joan Lunden that she has the support of the entire GMA extended family as the former host revealed her own cancer diagnosis on Tuesday morning . Revealing how she felt when she was told the news, Lunden said that telling her two sets of twins, aged 11 and nine was difficult. Sitting down, Max and Kate, 11 and Jack and Kimberly, both nine, Lunden said that she was confident explaining her condition, because 'mommy is going to be ok' 'And that is really the bottom line,' she told Roberts live on air. Both twins were born with the help of a surrogate mother and Lunden said that her three older girls from her previous marriage have been a great help too. 'When something like this happens you learn just how important family is,' said Lunden about the strength she draws from Jamie, 34, Lindsay, 31 and Sarah, 27. Strength: Joan Lunden with husband Jeff, daughters,  Jamie, 34, Lindsay, 31 and Sarah, 27 and their two sets of twins Max and Kate, 11 and Jack and Kimberly, both nine . Family: Charlie Gibson of Good Morning America with Sarah Krauss, Lindsay Krauss, Max Konigsberg, Joan Lunden Kate Konigsberg, Jeff Konigsberg and Jamie Krauss . New family: Dedorah Bolig- Surrogate Mother of Twins Kate and Max Konigsberg With Joan Lunden and Jeff Konigsberg . The popular former anchor added that her husband, Jeff Konigsberg, whom she married in April, 2000, has been incredibly in his support. Lunden, who co-hosted GMA from 1980 to 1997, said she initially considered keeping the news private, but decided to go public with her diagnosis. 'I have decided to talk about my breast cancer because since the moment I took the job at Good Morning America I have lived my life sharing my joys and my disappointments with all of you: my pregnancies, my relationships, my career… I have shared my journey,' Lunden wrote. 'So it certainly didn’t feel right keeping this part of my journey a secret.' During the course of this morning's interview, Lunden revealed her reaction to the diagnosis. 'I heard those words that every woman dreads and fears and never wants to hear. You have breast cancer,' said Lunden, who admitted she has already started her chemotherapy. 'In the beginning you almost think, what did I do wrong? But then I just turned a corner and I said wait a second. 'I went into warrrior mode.' Final show: Good Morning America co-host Joan Lunden is applauded by staff members as she is flanked by co-host Charles Gibson, seated left, and weatherman Spencer Christian on the set of the show Friday, Sept. 5, 1997, in New York . Lunden, who has long been a campaigner for women's health issues said that it was her commitment to thorough testing that allowed her cancer to be caught. 'Nothing showed in my mammogram. Then you go all happy go lucky into the ultrasound and she kept going back to one spot and I knew they had found something,' said Lunden. 'My husband sat with me and I knew the minute she walked in the door, I could just tell by her demeanor. 'I have the more aggressive kind so its going to be the chemotherapy and the surgery and the radiation.' Lunden said she is optimistic about her prognosis, and said women everywhere need to go through their annual checkups. She added that her father, a prominent cancer surgeon who died in a plane crash when Lunden was young, would have wanted her to spread the word about cancer screenings. 'I consider myself fortunate that I found this in the early stages and the prognosis is so promising,' Lunden wrote. 'I know I have a challenge ahead of me in this journey, however I have chosen to take it as an opportunity to fulfill my father’s legacy and try to inspire others to protect their health.

"By . Eddie Wrenn . It's here, but with some niggles: A small number of early iPhone 5 buyers have reported problems with their handsets . The iPhone 5 launch has been one of the biggest and most successful in history. But that doesn't mean it has been without problems, with users who got their hands on early models reporting a wealth of problems. The catalogue of complaints include faulty wi-fi connections and scratching on the aluminum casing, as well as confused weather reports from the voice-activated Siri assistant and reports of light 'bleeding' out from the side of the phone. More disturbing seems to be the small number of handsets which 'rattle' when shaken - attributed to to a loose battery within the device, while other users are finding that their batteries drain within hours. Users are also warned that the iCloud storage service run by Apple will be reduced from 20GB of storage space to 5GB at the end of the month - potentially placing back-ups at risk. Alongside complaints about the patchy quality of Apple's new Maps app, the website Ars Technica collated a variety of bugs from Apple users, largely sourced from Apple's support forums. It is not unexpected for some new devices to have manufacturing errors - particularly when five million products have been shipped within the opening weekend. Even if just one per cent of the first batch of phones has an error, that is still 50,000 defective handsets in the market. Some users are reporting problems with connecting to secured WiFi networks - with connections either being blocked or running slowly. Users on the Apple forums suggest this is a software issue which will be resolved with new firmware updates. While the phone appears to be fairly . resistant to scratching, there are also reports that the aluminium . casing on the iPhone can wear off around the screen. The LED backlight also reportedly 'bleeds out' from the screen, appearing as a thin white light around the edges of the screen. Stocked up: An Apple employee racks up hundreds of iPhone 5s in Hong Kong . For those who use Siri for their weather updates, many users are finding that the voice-activated personal assistant is mixing up its cities. If you ask for the weather in New York City, Siri reports the weather for New York, Texas - yet on-screen it still says it is reporting on the city. it is also confusing Richmond, Virginia with New Richmond, Ohio, alongside other place-names which appear more than once on a map. Ars Technica finally warned that users will no longer be offered 20GB of free space when they sign up to iCloud - instead the space is plummeting to just five gigabytes. This may not be enough to contain all your cloud back-ups - particularly if you own more than one Apple device - so users are warned they should consider paying Apple $40 a year, or risk losing their data.","Problems include phones that 'rattle' and light 'bleeding' out of the screen .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A glamour model who missed probation meetings to get a boob job has revealed she has been arrested 25 times - and claims she isn't scared of spending a night in a cell as she knows she will get out the next day. Sophie Dalzell, 20, hit the headlines earlier this month when she missed two probation meetings to get breast enlargement surgery in Brussels. The model, who previously refused to wear an electronic tag as it interfered with her adult TV work, today sensationally claimed she's not scared of spending the night in a police cell as she knows she will soon be released. Sophie Dalzell, says she has been arrested 25 times - and that she isn't scared of spending a night in a cell as she will be 'let out the next day' The model - who claims she is often attacked for her looks - told a magazine today she 'never walks away' from a fight' and that she 'has the right to defend' herself. Speaking with Closer Magazine, Miss Dalzell said: 'I will never walk away from a fight. If someone starts on me, I have got a right to defend myself.. 'It is usually girls I have trouble with. They make b***** comments about my appearance. 'I pull their hair and scratch their faces. It has become normal for a night out to end in a fight.' Miss . Dalzell, originally from Workington, Cumbria, added: 'I am not scared . of being in a police cell because I know I will get out the next day. The model was cleared of missing two probation meetings at Manchester Magistrates' court, pictured. She walked from court after producing a letter from the Brussels clinic where she had her surgery . 'I don’t worry about going to prison as the courts only give you a community service or a fine.' She told the magazine she had no intention of changing her ways - saying she never provokes the fights, but instead 'stands her ground.' However, she admitted she would like to calm down and have a family at some point. The model has 11 previous convictions. She drunkenly attacked two police officers in May 2012 - and was ordered to do 400 hours of litter-picking. Within months, she was hauled back to court for missing two probation meetings to get a second breast enlargement in Belgium. She faced the court this month for breaching the order by failing to give a 'reasonable excuse' for missing the January meetings. But magistrates cleared Miss Dalzell when she produced a letter from a Brussels plastic surgeon. With 180 hours of litter picking left to . complete, Miss Dalzell has now declared she has ground to a halt because she . 'just can't physically do it'. 'At the moment I am refusing to go because I hate everything about it,' she told The Sun. 'They make you work from 8am until 4pm. It's a waste of a full day and it's just too hard for me.' In the interview published today, she told Closer she received two black eyes and a broken nose in one of her last fights. She said she usually just covers up her wounds with thick make up - but sometimes her fighting means she misses out on modelling jobs. However, the model says she's got 'plenty of money saved up' so not working 'is not a problem'. The model, who earns up to £4,000 a month, had her operation to increase her bra size from a 32C to a 32DD. Speaking about the decision to go under the knife, rather than attend her meetings, she said the operation was important for her work so she 'didn't want to miss it.' She added that she gave the court a medial note - and she was asked to pay a £95 fine instead. Miss Dalzell, from Workington, Cumbria, said she usually covers up any of her fighting wounds with makeup. She added she doesn't mind if her fights means she missed a job as she's got 'plenty of money'","Glamour model Sophie Dalzell, 20, says she has been arrested 25 times .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . A virtual robot that can pose as a 14-year-old schoolgirl to lure and trap paedophiles on social networks has been created by Spanish engineers. The sophisticated computer program, also known as a 'chatbot', is called Negobot and capable of having conversations with potential sexual predators online and fooling them into believing it is a real person. And now a police force in Spain is looking at ways in which it could employ the undercover robot. A virtual robot called Negobot has been created by Spanish engineers to protect teenagers from potential sexual predators when online. The software, known as a 'chatbot', is capable of having conversations with paedophiles and tricking them into thinking its a real person . At a computer conference in India, a software called Cleverbot succeeded in fooling 59.3 per cent of 1,334 voters that it was a human being. Cleverbot was tested alongside humans, for 'control' purposes. The audience watched as 30 volunteers conducted a four-minute typed conversation with an online chatter who could either be a Cleverbot, or a real person behind a screen. The conversations were displayed on a big screen for the audience to vote on. Placed in a forum where a paedophile is thought to be lurking, Negobot starts off as a passive and neutral participant in general online conversations. As conversations become more intimate or suggestive, and the 'target' begins to employ grooming tactics, Negobot's behaviour changes in ways designed to lure him in. The chatbot can appear insistent or offended, and an attempt to obtain personal information will cause Negobot to try to find out more about the suspect. Scientists used game theory, a mathematical system of strategic decision making, to make its behaviour more convincing. Negobot has been programmed to have a split personality, with seven different conversation patterns, to make it more convincing. Other tricks include inserting 'typos', abbreviations, and deliberate language errors to mimic the actions of a young teenager. One of Negobot's creators, Dr Carlos Laorden, from the University of Deusto, said: 'Chatbots tend to be very predictable. 'Their . behaviour and interest in a conversation are flat, which is a problem . when attempting to detect untrustworthy targets like paedophiles. 'What is new about Negobot is that it employs game theory to maintain a much more realistic conversation.' This flow diagram demonstrates how the Negobot goes about having a conversation with potential predators on social network sites. It has been programmed with seven different personality types and can add typos to conversations as well as feign offense to appear more life-like . In tests, not only could the program resume discussions separated in time, but it was able to 'take the lead' in conversations and use slang expressions. The team had a collaborative agreement with the Ertzaintza, the Basque Country police force, which has shown 'considerable interest', said Dr Laorden. 'Negobot has already been implemented and trialled actively on Google's chat service and could also be translated into other languages,' he added. 'We do not discard the possibility of bringing it to new channels in the future and we believe it could be a very useful tool for social networks to incorporate.' Despite having a high degree of artificial intelligence, Negobot's powers of conversation are still limited, the researchers point out and it is unable to detect linguistic subtleties such as irony, for example.","The sophisticated computer program is called Negobot and poses as 14-year-old .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Black British actors are being forced to move to America because they are not given a chance in the UK, stand up comic Lenny Henry told MPs today. The Comic Relief founder said Hollywood stars like Idris Elba, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Marianne Jean-Baptiste were being overlooked by the BBC and other TV bosses. He pointed to the lack of ethnic minorities on TV - but praised EastEnders as the top show for showing black and Asian families. Lenny Henry today called on MPs to guarantee more jobs for black and ethnic minority actors on TV. He said stars like Idris Elba did not need extra training - they just needed a break . Hollywood actors like '12 Years A Slave' star Chiwetel Ejiofor (left), The Wire's Idris Elba (centre) and  Marianne Jean-Baptiste (right) - who was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar for her role in Secrets & Lies . The actor - joined by former BBC chief Patrick Younge and the corporations's current Scottish news boss Marcus Ryder - unveiled a 'Henry' plan to get more black and ethnic minorities into the TV industry. Under Mr Henry's proposals, the BBC will have to hit targets for hiring top black and ethnic minority actors and producers. The comedian told MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee that black actors like Idris Elba did not need greater training or other gimmicks - they 'just need a break'. He added: 'Initiatives don't work, jobs do.' He said: 'We are haemorrhaging talent in this country. Not just BME (black and minority ethnic) people like Idris Elba and Marianne Jean-Baptiste. They could be working here benefiting us.' Mr Henry shot to fame when he won the talent show New Faces in 1975. He has criticised the TV and film industry for not providing a 'fair and honest reflection of our society' and recently signed up to a committee advising the corporation on its representation of ethnic minorities. The session comes the day after the acting chairman of the BBC Trust - the corporation's governing body - said it should do more to 'provide an authentic portrayal' of modern Britain . Diane Coyle, who is in the running to replace Lord Patten as head of the trust, admitted its flagship soap EastEnders is 'almost twice' as white as the real East London. In a speech at the London School of Economics, Ms Coyle, said the BBC's Audience Council for England 'compared the population of Walthamstow in East London with Walford - the fictional home of EastEnders'. She said: 'The Audience Council figures suggested that there are almost twice as many white people living in fictional E20 as in real life E17, while the population of EastEnders tends to be younger than their real life counterparts and more likely to have been born in the UK.' Former Chief Creative Officer of BBC Television Production Patrick Younge joined Lenny Henry at the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee today . She said it would be 'daft' for the show to be a 'perfect replica' of the real world, but said it was 'important to ask whether the BBC can do more in its popular output to provide an authentic portrayal of life in modern Britain'. Director-General Tony Hall announced last week that the BBC would set up a new £2.1 million 'diversity creative talent fund' to help 'fast-track' shows by ethnic minority talent onto the screen and create a series of development programmes aimed at encouraging future commissioners and executives from ethnic minority backgrounds. He also said he wanted to see ethnic minorities account for 15 per cent of on-air talent in the next three years. A BBC spokesman said: 'Last week we set out far reaching plans that we believe will make a tangible difference - we will work hard to deliver them and of course reserve the option of going further if we fall short, but people should judge us on progress over the coming months and years before concluding the need for even more measures.'","Stand up comic  said black actors did not need extra training - just a break .
