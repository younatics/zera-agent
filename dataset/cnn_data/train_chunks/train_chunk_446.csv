"(CNN)Like many 23-year-olds, Alain Nteff has big dreams. What sets him apart from most, however, is what he's actually trying to achieve: wiping out maternal mortality. The Cameroonian entrepreneur is the co-founder of Gifted Mom, a mobile health platform that uses low-cost technology to help mothers and pregnant women access medical advice in out-of-the-way, rural communities. His invention landed him an invitation to the World Economic Forum in Davos this year, where he was one of this year's Global Shapers, a group of 20 to 30-year-olds who are tipped for future leadership roles. He was also the youngest participant. The seed for the Gifted Mom idea was planted in 2012 when Nteff, then a 20-year-old engineering student, visited a hospital in rural Cameroon where his friend Conrad Tankou was doing his medical practice. There he witnessed several mothers and newborns die from conditions that could have been predicted and managed with proper antenatal care. Nteff was deeply affected by what he saw, and together with Tankou started thinking of ways in which they could use their skills to tackle the issue of maternal and infant mortality. ""I'm passionate about using technology to solve problems in my community, and I just saw it as an opportunity to apply my engineering to solve one of the world's biggest and oldest problems,"" says Nteff. Low-cost, far reach . His answer was to create an SMS service that expectant and new mothers could register for to receive advice about their health, including why it's important to have regular check-ups: ""We realized that there was a need to create a low cost channel to educate women on when they should go for antenatal care and when they should take their babies for vaccination,"" says the entrepreneur. Initially only eight women signed up, but through word-of-mouth the reputation of Gifted Mom grew, and today the service has 2,100 subscribers across the whole country. Registering is easy -- a woman just has to text MOM to 8006 to receive a call back and get help signing up. Or, she can text a particular health question to the same number and get a reply from a doctor. Gifted Mom works with the Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action, a USAID-backed movement that uses mobile technology to improve maternal health in the developing world, and a team of medical doctors led by Tankou to find answers to the queries. ""The SMS we sent to the first pregnant woman was special -- she said that when she read it she felt so much joy, and she was telling me 'I feel now that somebody's got my back,'"" says Nteff. There is a one-off subscription fee of less than one dollar, but all subsequent messages which include alerts for when vaccinations for newborns are due, are free. In order to include the roughly 17% of Cameroonian women who are illiterate, the Gifted Mom team are also developing voice technology in four widely spoken traditional languages. Last September, Nteff was named the grand prize winner of the $25,000 Anzisha Prize, a pan-African award celebrating entrepreneurs aged 15-22 who've come up with innovative ways to solve problems in their communities, or have launched successful businesses in their areas. ""The message I am trying to send out with my team is that the problem of maternal and infant death is not a woman issue -- it's a humanitarian issue,"" he says. ""Everybody should take [it] seriously -- we all have mothers, we all have sisters, and it's not just a problem for women or girls. Game of odds . Improving maternal health has been one of U.N.'s Millennium Development Goals, and while the maternal mortality ratio has dropped by 45 % between 1990 and 2013, a woman's odds for survival dramatically depend on where she delivers her baby. In the developed world, the risk of dying during pregnancy or childbirth is one in 3700, but in Sub-Saharan Africa that number jumps to one in 38 -- nearly a hundred times more. Cameroon has particularly bad odds for expectant mothers, with over 590 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births which is one of the highest ratios in both Africa and the world. Around 64% of new mothers in the country don't receive any medical check-ups after delivering a baby according to the World Health Organization. Alain Nteff thinks that this could be because women living in remote communities with no hospitals and health centers often don't know what steps they need to take to ensure that they and their newborns are healthy. ""Our mission is really to create a world of mothers who are gifted. A world that is free of maternal and infant death -- a world of gifted moms,"" he says. More from African Start-Up .

"New York (CNN)A federal jury at the New York trial of a Pakistani man allegedly involved in al Qaeda conspiracy to carry out attacks in New York and Europe will be the first presented with evidence seized at the 2011 raid in which Osama bin Laden was killed, a prosecutor said in opening statements Tuesday. Abid Naseer, 28, who was arrested in 2009 in Manchester, England, where he had been living on a student visa, was described by Brooklyn federal prosecutor Celia Cohen as a ""key member"" of a broad scheme to ""take innocent lives"" during a series of failed attacks at a Manchester shopping center, a newsroom in Copenhagen and the subways of New York. Naseer, who is representing himself at trial, was flanked by a pair of U.S. Marshals as he delivered an opening statement. He called the charges false and said he went to Pakistan not to meet with al Qaeda operatives but to see his mother after she had bypass surgery. Naseer was allegedly named in paperwork found in the walled and fortified compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where Osama bin Laden, the former leader of al Qaeda, was killed in 2011 by a group of U.S. forces, including Navy SEALs, according to Cohen. One piece of evidence will be a letter in which bin Laden is updated on plans for the attacks in New York and Europe, Cohen told jurors. Naseer is accused of providing and conspiring to provide material support to al Qaeda and conspiracy to use a destructive device in relation to the British plot. He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted. Cohen told jurors that evidence will show that Naseer received terrorist training in Pakistan and communicated with al Qaeda about the alleged plot using coded email messages under online addresses that appeared to belong to a female. ""The defendant was a key member in the conspiracy plot,"" Cohen said. ""He planned a scheme to take innocent lives."" The bearded defendant, wearing a light yellow button-down shirt and black slacks, calmly told jurors during his opening that the charges against him were false. He concocted the email addresses to play pranks on friends and to meet women online, he said. His emails were innocent and not coded. Naseer also said he was in Britain looking for a wife, not planning an attack. He told jurors that he has ""no extremist or jihadi views"" or affiliation with any terrorist network. The first witness for the prosecution was Najibullah Zazi, who allegedly cooperated with Naseer and pleaded guilty to terrorism charges. Also expected to testify is Zarein Ahmedzay. According to the indictment and other court filings, al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan in 2008 recruited Zazi, Ahmedzay and another suspect to conduct a suicide bombing attack in New York. The al Qaeda leaders communicated with Zazi about the plot through an al Qaeda facilitator named ""Ahmad"" in Peshawar, Pakistan. In early September 2009, Zazi, Ahmedzay and Adis Medunjanin allegedly selected the New York subway system as their target, and Zazi emailed with ""Ahmad"" in Pakistan about the proper ingredients for the main charge explosive, which included flour and oil, according to court papers. Zazi pleaded guilty to his role in the plot in February 2010; Ahmedzay pleaded guilty in April 2010; and Medunjanin was convicted after trial in  May 2012. Naseer's 2009 arrest in England was part of a massive sweep in connection with an alleged plot to carry out bomb attacks in Britain. He was extradited in January 2013. CNN's Laura Ly contributed to this story.","Abid Naseer, 28, who was arrested in 2009 in Manchester, England .

"(CNN)It's something pioneer nurseryman Johnny Appleseed likely never imagined. The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday approved America's first genetically modified apples. Their appeal: They don't turn brown when bruised or sliced. ""This is really huge. It's what we've waited almost five years for with regulatory approval,"" says Neal Carter, founder and president of Okanagan Specialty Fruits, the Canadian company that engineered the apples. ""Now we can get down to business planting trees and selling Arctic apples. We're stoked."" The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service granted its approval ""... based on a final plant pest risk assessment that finds the GE (genetically engineered) apples are unlikely to pose a plant pest risk to agriculture and other plants in the United States ... [and] deregulation is not likely to have a significant impact on the human environment."" The Food and Drug Administration is not required to approve genetically engineered crops for consumption. Most companies engage in a voluntary safety review process with the FDA, and Okanagan is doing that. Scientists working on genetically engineered plants and animals typically add -- rather than remove -- genes to formulate more desirable variations of their products. For example, a GMO salmon, engineered by AquaBounty Technologies, is mostly Atlantic salmon -- with a Pacific salmon gene added to make it grow faster, plus an added eel gene to make it grow year round. To create their Granny and Golden varieties, Okanagan turned off an enzyme that causes apples to turn brown. But what else did they turn off? ""These are called 'nontarget effects,' and I'm comfortable and confident this hasn't happened,"" says Carter. ""We've had them in the ground and have been watching them grow for 12 years, compiling data and statistics. The trees produce flowers and fruit of the same composition and analysis [as conventional apples]."" But not everyone is convinced. Mira and Jayson Calton, the husband-and-wife authors of ""Rich Food, Poor Food,"" launched a Change.org petition two years ago to ""Say NO to GMO Apples."" ""We sounded the alarm back in 2013 and hoped people would understand what a slippery slope it is to have all of these foods that are genetically modified,"" says Mira Calton. ""Obviously, we can't say without a doubt that GMOs are dangerous, but we can say that not enough human studies have been done. We don't want to be the guinea pigs."" ""This particular food is very upsetting because we give it to our children,"" says Mira Calton. ""It's the symbol of health here in America. 'An apple a day keeps the doctor away.' "" What you might not realize is that some genetically modified foods are likely part of your diet already. In November, the USDA approved a genetically engineered potato, developed by the J.R. Simplot Company, which uses a similar technique to prevent browning. Still, most of the genetically modified foods we eat are processed, containing ingredients made from bioengineered corn or soybeans. The majority of GMOs have been modified to fend off insects or survive being sprayed down with weedkillers, but the benefits of these new apples are geared toward the consumer. Where Carter sees apples that don't turn brown opening opportunities for more varied and prolonged use of the fruit, the Caltons see a conundrum. How will we be able to know when the apples have gone bad if they're no longer turning brown? We've got some time to mull it over. ""It takes two years to build a nursery and another two years to get fruit,"" says Carter. ""We're saying 20 acres of trees in the ground this spring will produce a small amount of fruit by fall 2016."" When that time comes, Carter doesn't feel his company should be forced to use a GMO label. ""We've spent time and money on five years of regulatory work to prove and to demonstrate our product is as safe as any other,"" he says. ""Label it just like any other apple. We'll have information at the point of sale, and we're very transparent on our website. Let the consumer decide.""","The U.S. Department of Agriculture approves America's first genetically modified apples .

"(CNN)NFL player Benjamin Watson wants to tackle race. He says he believes talking about race freely is the key to moving forward. On November 25, 2014, the tight end took to Facebook to express his thoughts about the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri. His message went viral with nearly 870,000 likes and more than 450,000 shares. Watson's take on the situation in Ferguson wasn't one-sided. The essay allowed a more fresh approach to one of the most delicate conversations in the U.S.: race relations. ""Anytime there's a situation where you've got police officers, you've got citizens, you've got the race aspect of it -- it's always a big deal. And everybody comes in on their own side. Everybody has specific experiences that lead them to their conclusions."" says Watson. ""I really think part of the race issue is just for us to be open and honest with each other."" Watson ended his post by turning to the Bible. He mentioned that situations like Ferguson stem from a ""sin"" problem rather than a ""skin"" problem. However, in his Facebook post, he felt encouraged because he feels the Gospel provides hope: . ""I'M ENCOURAGED, because ultimately the problem is not a SKIN problem, it is a SIN problem. SIN is the reason we rebel against authority. SIN is the reason we abuse our authority. SIN is the reason we are racist, prejudiced and lie to cover for our own. SIN is the reason we riot, loot and burn. ""BUT I'M ENCOURAGED because God has provided a solution for sin through the His son Jesus and with it, a transformed heart and mind. One that's capable of looking past the outward and seeing what's truly important in every human being. The cure for the Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice and Eric Garner tragedies is not education or exposure. It's the Gospel. So, finally, I'M ENCOURAGED because the Gospel gives mankind hope."" The reaction to Watson's post was mostly positive. But he drew some backlash when he suggested a faith-based solution to the nation's race problems. But his wife, Kirsten Watson, agreed with him wholeheartedly. ""His comment is based in truth. His emotions are his emotions, so that's how he felt about it and that's his perspective and I don't think that can be argued,"" she said. Watson received national attention when his Facebook post on the Ferguson situation went viral. But if you aren't a diehard football fan, you may not be familiar with No. 82 of the New Orleans Saints. Watson entered the league when he was drafted by the New England Patriots in 2004. Six years later, he signed with the Cleveland Browns. He joined the ""Who Dat Nation"" in 2013. Watson shared his Christian beliefs while expressing how upset he was about the fatal shooting of Michael Brown. Some may have been surprised about the amount of transparency the NFL player displayed. ""Being a Christian is who you are and playing football is what you do. I think when it comes to football, God had provided me a platform and I want to be responsible for what he has given me. And it's not comfortable for me all the time,"" he says. Watson's spiritual journey began during childhood. ""I'm the oldest of six kids. We had a 15-year gap between me and my youngest brother. My father is a pastor in South Carolina. I was born in Norfolk, Virginia, but we moved to South Carolina when I was in high school,"" says Watson. ""My dad used to say whatever you start, finish it. You are going to give 100% because you're not doing it just for yourself, you're doing it for the Lord."" In college, Watson found someone who shared his beliefs. He met his wife at the University of Georgia during a Fellowship of Christian Athletes meeting. ""One thing that Benjamin and I said when we got married is that we wanted our marriage to be a ministry. It makes sense we would talk about healing and bringing people together,"" says Kirsten Watson. And as a father of four -- soon to be five -- Benjamin Watson knows it all starts at home. ""I want my kids to see me as a leader, a protector, a lover of my wife. ... Daddy caring, but also trustworthy and faithful,""  he says. The couple started the One More Foundation to make a greater impact in communities and be an example to their children. ""We decided to start the organization not only to help others, but to leave a legacy for our kids of giving. We want them to understand that giving is important. Whether it's money, food or time, giving to someone else is what we're called to do.""","NFL tight end Benjamin Watson is a Christian, husband and father who shares his thoughts about life on social media .

"(CNN)We have sparred privately and publicly on a range of issues on any number of occasions. But on this one, we both agree: government should -- and can -- play ""Moneyball."" ""Moneyball for Government"" grew out of the approach pioneered by Billy Beane, former general manager of the Oakland Athletics baseball organization, who transformed baseball by using data to build championship teams with a limited budget. His story was told in the book by Michael Lewis and the 2011 movie. During the 2012 presidential election, a full 15% of voters surveyed said that the federal budget deficit was the most important issue facing the country. That was three times the number who cited foreign policy as their top concern and only narrowly behind those who named health care. Leading up to the 2014 midterm elections, 80% of respondents in a Gallup poll indicated that they worried about the federal budget deficit a great deal or a fair amount. There's no question: how to spend government revenue more effectively is very much on the minds of the American people -- Democrats and Republicans. The past few years of debt-ceiling standoffs, midnight ""fiscal cliffs"" and a government shutdown have meant that -- far from thoughtfully considering how we're spending taxpayer dollars -- we lurch from crisis to crisis, stopgap to stopgap, kicking the can still farther down the road. This is a problem for both parties; if that skepticism hardens, many members of Congress can expect to lose their jobs. In that sense, Moneyball, the devotion to using data and evidence to achieve more efficient results, represents an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to work together in a serious, thoughtful and measured way without forcing either side to step on political landmines. But opportunity does not mean guarantee. There will still be obstacles for both political parties and some degree of tentativeness on the part of skeptical officials. But we believe these challenges can be overcome. But what about the tea party? It would never go for this, would it? This skepticism grows out of a common view among Republicans -- within and beyond the establishment -- that the tea party, and by extension the Republican base, is reflexively anti-government. Not just in some cases, but in all cases. Republicans are right to listen to the base, to recognize its power, to stop assuming that incumbency is still an advantage. The problem is, they aren't really listening to the base as a whole -- just to its loudest voices. In doing so, they risk drawing conclusions about a range of policies, including the Moneyball agenda, that are, frankly, incorrect. It is a severe misdiagnosis of the tea party's recent influence to conclude that it is simply anti-government. Instead, there is a large swath of voters opposed to inefficient government, wasteful government and unaccountable government. Their concerns are valid -- quite often provable -- and they deserve to be heard. Nuanced analysis reveals that Republicans have a great deal to gain by focusing their political messaging -- and policy agenda -- on ""efficient government"" rather than on being ""anti-government."" The GOP should talk about keeping programs in place that work as intended and having the courage to cut those that don't. Republicans should demand high-quality evidence before any new program is created, and Republicans should insist that all discretionary spending be subject to evaluation to determine whether it is having an impact. Republicans who support the Moneyball campaign can then run on having the bravery to make the tough decisions to defund or discontinue programs that aren't working or haven't met standards or don't demonstrate positive trends toward success. Democrats' biggest political risk -- and thus the biggest progressive obstacle to implementing evidence-based policy making -- is that they are being thrown a Republican curveball. But, the truth is, Democrats have long been strong proponents of improving the way government works. President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore led a ""Reinventing Government"" movement in the 1990s. Elected Democrats across the country are using data and evidence to make tough choices and get better results. We know that this is about more than just dollars and cents; it goes to the core of the values that define what it means to be a Democrat. Democrats care about making people's lives better, care about lifting people up and care about reducing injustice and expanding opportunity. Democrats are optimists who believe that even the most intractable problems can be solved, and believe unapologetically that government can play a positive role in solving them. This is what ""Moneyball for Government"" is all about. It's about making sure that we are doing right by the people we've committed ourselves to serving. It's about making sure that our values aren't just articulated in our efforts but in our outcomes, and that we can actually say that we are delivering on our promises. So will overcoming these deep-seated political barriers be easy? Hardly. The two of us have spent too much time in the trenches to believe that all of our partisanship would magically disappear if we employed a Moneyball approach; some disagreements on values are sure to remain. But we've shown that there is a way for the Republican Party to make government work better while also limiting its explosive growth. There is a way Democrats can ensure they won't be conned into dismantling programs that we know can accomplish so much good. There is a way forward. Now it's up to all of us to seize it.","Kevin Madden, Howard Wolfson: Government should borrow ""Moneyball"" idea from baseball .

"(CNN)A federal judge in Texas has temporarily blocked President Barack Obama's executive action on immigration, which has drawn opposition from 26 states across the nation. United States District Judge Andrew Hanen ruled late Monday night to block executive actions Obama took late last year to shield as many as 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation. In delaying the ruling, Hanen halted Obama's executive action, ruling that the administration had failed to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act, which calls for the White House to afford a longer notification and comment period before taking action. The White House said in a statement early Tuesday that Obama's actions ""are well within his legal authority"" and that the Justice Department has indicated ""that it will appeal that decision."" ""The district court's decision wrongly prevents these lawful, commonsense policies from taking effect,"" the White House said in a statement. ""The Supreme Court and Congress have made clear that the federal government can set priorities in enforcing our immigration laws — which is exactly what the President did when he announced commonsense policies to help fix our broken . Obama said Tuesday he's confident that a Texas court's injunction against his executive order delaying deportations for millions of immigrants will ultimately be overruled, and is preparing to implement the order under that assumption. ""The Department of Homeland Security will continue with the planning because we want to make sure that as soon as these legal issues get resolved — which I anticipate they will, in our favor — that we are ready to go,"" he told reporters. Attorney General Eric Holder called the ruling just an ""interim step"" in a legal process that will take some time to play out. ""This is a decision by one federal district court judge,"" Holder said Tuesday at the National Press Club, adding that the Justice Department is reviewing the ruling to determine the next step. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, whose department would be responsible for implementing the executive orders, said he ""strongly"" disagrees with the judge's decision. Johnson said his department would comply with the injunction while the appeals process plays out and his department will not launch the DACA expansion on Wednesday, as previously scheduled. ""We fully expect to ultimately prevail in the courts, and we will be prepared to implement DAPA and expanded DACA once we do,"" Johnson said. Obama's decision to act unilaterally in November drew the ire of Republicans who immediately slammed the President's actions as unconstitutional and conservatives have now been waging a battle in Congress to tie funding for the Department of Homeland Security to killing Obama's immigration orders. The programs at issue are deferred action programs for undocumented parents of Americans and lawful residents and expansions to the program protecting illegal immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children -- known as DAPA and DACA, respectively. Neither program had gone into effect. Hanen issued the injunction after concluding that at least Texas has standing in federal court to pursue its lawsuit as Texas ""stands to suffer direct damages from the implementation of DAPA."" He also argues that Obama's executive action goes beyond the scope of prosecutorial discretion by ""bestowing benefits,"" which is more than ""non-enforcement."" ""The Court seriously doubts that the Supreme Court, in holding non-enforcement decisions to be presumptively unreviewable, anticipated that such ""non-enforcement"" decisions would include the affirmative act of bestowing multiple, otherwise unobtainable benefits upon an individual,"" Hanen wrote. Hanen's decision Monday came after Texas led 25 other states in a federal lawsuit to stop the executive action, and officials swiftly welcomed the judge's decision. ""This decision is a victory for the rule of law in America and a crucial first step in reining in President Obama's lawlessness,"" Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement. And Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who has championed efforts in Congress to undo Obama's executive action, welcomed the news on Twitter, calling the decision a ""HUGE victory for rule of law."" Texas's senior Sen. John Cornyn, also a Republican, said in a statement Tuesday that the ruling ""reinforces"" what he and other opponents have claimed, ""that President Obama acted outside the law."" ""Today's victory is an important one, but the fight to reverse the President's unconstitutional overreach is not over,"" Cornyn said. ""The President must respect the rule of law and fully obey the court's ruling."" But the Obama administration and supporters of the immigration orders were quick to counter conservative glee. Obama and his staff have long argued that the President has the legal right to take action, saying he only acted because Congress failed to pass immigration reform. Immigration activists were quick to characterize the court injunction as a just ""a bump in the road."" ""We've hit a speed bump on the road to the implementation of these programs, but folks should stay the course, get their documents ready, prepare to apply, because the programs will open their doors eventually,"" said Karen Tumlin, Managing Attorney of the National Immigration  Law Center. Cristina Jimenez, managing director of United We Dream, insisted that the federal ruling would not stand and said Hanen, a conservative appointed by President George W. Bush,""has become known as an advocate for the harsh treatment of immigrant families."" ""Executive action protecting immigrant youth and parents is solid,"" Jimenez said in a statement. ""Judge Hanen's ruling is not permanent and we are confident that it will be repealed in a higher court."" The Texas-led coalition of states in the legal challenge are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

"(CNN)When Malcolm X was assassinated on February 21, 1965, many Americans viewed his killing as simply the result of an ongoing feud between him and the Nation of Islam. He had publicly left the Nation of Islam in March 1964, and as the months wore on the animus between Malcolm's camp and the Nation of Islam grew increasingly caustic, with bitter denunciations coming from both sides. A week before he was killed, Malcolm's home -- owned by the Nation of Islam, which was seeking to evict him -- was firebombed, and Malcolm believed members of the Nation of Islam to be responsible. For investigators and commentators alike, then, his death was an open and shut case: Muslims did it. Yet although three members of the Nation of Islam were tried and found guilty for the killing, two of them maintained their innocence and decades of research has since cast doubt on the outcome of the case. Tens of thousands of declassified pages documenting government surveillance, infiltration and disruption of black leaders and organizations -- including Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam -- suggest the conclusions drawn by law enforcement were self-serving. Furthermore, irregularities in how investigators and prosecutors handled the case reflect at best gross negligence, and at worst something more sinister. At the time of his death, Time magazine remembered Malcolm X unsympathetically as ""a pimp, a cocaine addict and a thief"" and ""an unashamed demagogue."" But for those who had been paying closer attention to him, Malcolm X was an uncompromising advocate for the urban poor and working-class black America. Instead of advocating integration, he called for self-determination; instead of nonviolence in the face of violent anti-black attacks, he called for self-defense. He reserved moral appeals for other people committed to social justice; the government, on the other hand, he understood in terms of organized power -- to be challenged, disrupted and/or dismantled -- and sought to leverage alliances with newly independent African states to challenge that power. It was his challenge to the organized power of the state that appealed to growing numbers of African-Americans, and it was this challenge that also attracted a close following among federal, state and local law enforcement. Under Federal Bureau of Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover's watch, the FBI kept close tabs on Malcolm's every move through the use of informants and agents. Even before Malcolm began attracting large audiences and widespread media coverage in the late 1950s and early '60s, the FBI reported on his efforts to organize Nation of Islam mosques around the country. One organizing meeting in a private home in Boston in 1954 had maybe a dozen or so people present; one of them reported to the FBI. After Malcolm left the Nation of Islam in March 1964, agents pondered the prospect of a depoliticized more religious Malcolm, but still perceived him as a threat. On June 5, 1964, Hoover sent a telegram to the FBI's New York office that simply and plainly instructed, ""Do something about Malcolm X enough of this black violence in NY."" One wonders, what that ""something"" was. In New York, the FBI's actions were complemented by, if not coordinated with, the New York Police Department's Bureau of Special Services, which regularly logged license plates of cars parked outside mosques, organizational meetings, business and homes. The actions of the police on the day of Malcolm's assassination are particularly noteworthy. Normally up to two dozen police were assigned at Malcolm X's rallies, but on February 21, just a week after his home had been firebombed, not one officer was stationed at the entrance to the Audubon ballroom where the meeting took place. And while two uniformed officers were inside the building, they remained in a smaller room, at a distance from the main event area. The lack of a police presence was unusual and was compounded by internal compromises on the part of Malcolm's own security staff, which included at least one Bureau of Special Services agent who had infiltrated his organization. Reportedly at Malcolm's request, his security had abandoned the search procedure that had been customary at both Nation of Islam and Muslim Mosque/Organization of Afro-American Unity meetings. Without the search procedure, his armed assassins were able to enter the ballroom undetected. When the assassins stood up to shoot Malcolm, his security guards stationed at the front of the stage moved not to secure him, but to clear out of the way. These anomalies, in and of themselves, could have been inconsequential. But combined, even if just by coincidence, they proved to be deadly, and allowed for one of the most prophetic revolutionary voices of the 20th century to be silenced. The investigation that followed was just as careless. The crime scene was not secured for extensive forensic analysis -- instead, it was cleaned up to allow for a scheduled dance to take place that afternoon, with bullet holes still in the wall! For activists, of course, Malcolm X's death took on greater significance than law enforcement publicly expressed. Congress of Racial Equality Chairman James Farmer was among the first to suggest that Malcolm's murder was more than just an act of sectarian violence between two rival black organizations. ""I believe this was a political killing,"" he asserted, in response to Malcolm's growing national profile within the civil rights movement. He called for a federal inquiry -- unbeknownst to Farmer, an ironic request given the level of covert federal oversight that was already in place. Slowly, Farmer's doubts gained considerable traction. Author and journalist Louis Lomax, who had covered Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam on several occasions, put Malcolm X's assassination in context with Martin Luther King Jr.'s in ""To Kill a Black Man"" (1968). More than four decades ago, activist George Breitman was among the first to challenge the police version of who was responsible for Malcolm X's death. More recently, the work done at Columbia University's Malcolm X Project, culminating in Manning Marable's Pulitzer Prize-winning ""Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention,"" echoed these doubts and put at the forefront these unanswered questions about Malcolm X's murder. These questions deserve answers. They call upon us to revisit not just the political significance of Malcolm X's life, but the implications of his murder. Our government especially deserves scrutiny for its covert information gathering, disinformation campaigns, and even violence waged against its own citizens. Fifty years later, we still have more to learn from Malcolm X's life, and his death, and our government's actions toward him.","Malcolm X was assassinated on February 21, 1965 .

"(CNN)Barack Obama is convening a landmark White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism with key international leaders in an attempt to develop an urgently needed plan to tackle terrorism and radicalization across the world. The importance of the summit was brought into sharp focus, yet again, with the terror attacks in Copenhagen over the weekend. While the facts of the case are still being pieced together, Danish intelligence agencies are ""operating under a theory"" that the attacker may have been inspired by the horrific events in Paris last month. Nearly a decade and a half after the 9/11 attacks, there remains a key flaw in the ongoing U.S.-led ""War on Terror:"" Washington's response has been hyper-militarized, dominated by counter-terrorism and security, while other soft power instruments like public diplomacy have been under-invested in. To be sure, even this badly unbalanced strategy has secured some key successes, including the unseating of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. But an overwhelming emphasis on hard power has fueled significant controversy and alienated many across the world. Obama recognizes this much more so than his predecessor George W. Bush, but the fact remains that American policy is still viewed internationally as overly military and security-focused. Since Obama assumed office, there has been a huge increase in drone attacks and this is controversial both domestically and overseas. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry highlighted the need for a paradigm shift in the campaign on terrorism only last month, calling for a ""shift in gears onto a path that will demand more from us ... politically, economically, and socially ... a truly comprehensive and long-term strategy to destroy [terrorism's] very roots."" Kerry's argument is that while military power can degrade terrorist groups like ISIS, it can't defeat or destroy the ideology behind it. For that, a much wider, holistic effort is needed. And with the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War approaching, Kerry compared this forthcoming challenge with what Washington and its international allies faced in tackling fascism in that previous generation. One of the most glaring gaps that now badly needs to be addressed is need for a turbo-charged soft-power effort to win hearts and minds around the world. As Obama has said, this must include an ""alternative narrative"" for a disaffected generation, especially in Muslim-majority countries. Obama summit aims to battle extremists, Islamic and otherwise . In numerous key countries such as Turkey, Jordan and Pakistan, polls show that positive opinions toward the United States have fallen off a cliff in the last decade and a half. Just 10%, 12%, and 14% of the populations in these three countries, respectively, have a positive image of America, according to the latest Pew Global Research. This is key because the anti-terrorism contest is, in essence, one whose outcome is related to a battle between moderates and extremists within Islamic civilizations. And unless this fundamental is better recognized and addressed, with soft power dialled up significantly, the U.S.-led international strategy will continue to face serious setbacks, if not outright failure. In the context of the campaign against terrorism, soft power represents the capacity of Washington and its allies to persuade others (both states and individuals) without brute force -- in other words, the ability to attract others by legitimacy of policies and the values that underpin them. The roadmap for what is needed is relatively clear. Seizing the moment requires the United States and international partners to give much higher priority to non-military, civilian instruments of national power such as public diplomacy, strategic communications, foreign aid and development assistance, and exchange programs. At Wednesday's summit, Obama will rightly note that this is an expensive, demanding and complex generational project that the U.S. and its allies cannot achieve alone -- which is why multiple international leaders from other arenas like the private sector, NGOs and faith communities will also be in attendance. While Kerry last month drew an analogy with the Second World War, it is the Cold War that perhaps provides an even better comparison with what is now needed in the campaign against terrorism. Just like the Cold War, which was ultimately won by a strategy of U.S.-led international containment and cultural vigor, the challenges posed by the campaign against terrorism need a much smarter balance between hard and soft power, with resources to match. Numerous U.S. officials, including former Bush and Obama defense secretary Robert Gates, have highlighted the gross mismatch between the current budgets of the Pentagon and other U.S. international programs. Today, for instance, Washington spends about 500 times more on its military than it does collectively on the international broadcasting and exchanges that proved so successful during the Cold War. Of course a comprehensive international plan to tackle violent extremism will inevitably have a military and counter-terrorism component. But soft power needs to become a much bigger part of the overall mix, as even Gates, the former Pentagon chief, advocates. America and its international partners must urgently address this Achilles heel in the campaign against terrorism. While a limited window of opportunity exists to get this agenda kick-started before Obama's term of office ends, a sustained commitment will be required for many years beyond his presidency.","14 years after 9/11 attacks, there remains a key flaw in the U.S.-led 'war on terror'

"President Barack Obama told a large union audience in Wisconsin on Monday that while ""Republicans in Congress love to say no,"" he is the one who ""placed a bet on America's workers."" In a speech that skirted the line between politics and policy, Obama outlined what many Democrats are using as a midterm platform, highlighting hopes to raise the minimum wage and pass immigration reform. Obama also used the speech to portray Republicans as obstructionists who are holding the country back. The President told the receptive audience that ""most of the policies I am talking about have two things in common. They are going to help more families get ahead. And Republicans who run our Congress oppose almost all of them."" When the crowd broke out in a chorus of boos, Obama reflexively turned to a now oft-used line: ""Don't boo, vote. Don't boo, vote. It is easy to boo, I want you to vote."" The political line was a staple during Obama's 2012 re-election campaign. ""I want an economy where your hard work pays off with higher wages and higher income and fair pay for women and workplace flexibility for parents and affordable health insurance and decent retirement benefits,"" Obama said. ""I'm not asking for the moon, I just want a good deal for American workers."" Although the Obama administration billed the appearance as an official White House event set to ""underscore the important progress America has made since the economic collapse,"" the Laborfest speech featured a jacket-less Obama who, for most the most part, appeared to be in campaign mode. ""I think eventually Congress is going to hear them. We'll break those folks down. We'll just stay on it. We'll just keep at it,"" Obama said. ""'Cause the only thing more powerful than an idea whose time has come is when millions of people organizing around an idea whose time has come. Millions of people are voting for an idea whose time has come."" The President used the Labor Day gathering of 6,000 union members and their families to herald organized labor's role in passing the 40-hour work week, overtime pay for workers and a minimum wage. Standing before helmet-clad workers sporting ""We Are One"" t-shirts, Obama also said he would likely join a union. ""If I were looking for a good job that lets me build some security for my job, I'd join a union,"" the President said to raucous applause. ""If I were busting my butt in the service industry and wanted an honest day's pay for an honest day's work, I'd join a union...I'd want a union looking out for me and if I cared about these things I'd also want more Democrats looking out for me."" The midterms are important for Democrats and Obama's legacy. Midterms in a second term are historically bad for the President's party, and Democrats are facing the prospect of losing the Senate and staying the minority in the House in 2014. ""Republicans in Congress love to say no,"" Obama said. ""Those are just facts, the facts of life. They say no to everything."" While Obama focused much of the speech on the midterms, he was noticeably mum on Wisconsin's hotly contested race for governor between Democrat Mary Burke and Republican incumbent Scott Walker. According to a Marquette Law School poll, 49% of likely Wisconsin voters support Burke compared to 47% for Walker. The survey has a sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points, which means the two candidates are locked in a statistical dead heat. Before Obama's speech, Burke walked around Laborfest and shook hands with supporters and union members. Burke and Obama did not appear on stage together, but the gubernatorial candidate did tweet that she had a ""great chat"" with Obama backstage and that she looks ""fwd to seeing him again b4 11/4."" A spokesman for Burke said before the event that the two won't appear together because the event is ""an official White House event and not a campaign event,"" therefore her ""participation in the public portion of events would not be appropriate."" A Democratic National Committee official told CNN last week that Obama will appear with Burke before Election Day. Obama also met Walker, who greeted and shook hands with the President when he walked off Air Force One at General Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee. ""Had no problem greeting the President just like I have no problem explaining how I differ with him on things like ObamaCare,"" Walker tweeted Monday night. Wisconsin has been a friendly state for Obama. In 2008, he won the state by 14 points and in 2012 he carried the state by seven points.

"(CNN)Lifelong runner and Austin Marathon race director John Conley has been a part of many races, but none of the finishes he's been a part of quite compare to what he saw Sunday in Texas. ""What we saw was a champion,"" Conley said.  ""The toughest person on the planet."" Conley's not talking about Cynthia Jerop, the women's winner, who finished the 26.2-mile race in 2:54:21. He'd expected to see Kenyan runner Hyvon Ngetich. According to reports he'd received from the race course, she had been leading most of the race. But with just two-tenths of a mile left to run, Ngetich began to wobble and stagger, and eventually fell down.  She attempted to get back up and keep running but was unsuccessful, Conley said. But Ngetich never stopped moving forward. With members of the race team 's medical staff walking on all sides cheering her on, Ngetich crawled to the finish line. ""As bad as it looks, we knew she was prepared to finish,"" Conley said. With just 2 meters left for her to crawl, Ngetich was passed by second place finisher Hannah Steffan. Ngetich placed third, with a time of 3:04:02. Conley said Ngetich crawled more than 400 meters (1,312 feet) to cross the finish line, leaving her knees and elbows bloodied and her hands stained from the pavement. She was immediately rushed to a medical tent, where she was treated for dangerously low blood sugar, Conley said. Ngetich told CNN affiliate KEYE she doesn't remember finishing the race. Her ""exceptional effort,"" inspired applause from nearly every marathon spectator and inspired Conley to adjust her prize money so she receives the same amount of money as if she'd come in second. ""You ran the bravest race and crawled the bravest crawl I have ever seen in my life,"" Conley said to Ngetich on Sunday night, ""You have earned much honor."" Ngetich said it's just what she does. ""In running, you have to keep going,"" she said.","Hyvon Ngetich had led most of the race .

"(CNN)Watching from the observers' gallery last week, I could see Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim moving from hope, to exasperation and then finally to anger as the country's highest court dismissed his defense team's arguments against his sodomy conviction. After his appeal was denied on all counts, the sentencing hearing started -- and Anwar took the gloves off, declaring the incident was a ""complete fabrication"" and a ""political conspiracy"" and attacking the five Federal Court judges for becoming ""partners in the crime for the murder of judicial independence and integrity."" The judges weren't having any of that, and abruptly stood up and walked out of the courtroom to deliberate in chambers on Anwar's fate, leaving a stunned courtroom behind them. Anwar now faces five years in prison to contemplate the question that is on the minds of many Malaysians, which is how could a government get away with prosecuting a former deputy prime minister and the head of the opposition not once, but twice, for violating an archaic British colonial law against sodomy that has been invoked a total of only seven times since 1938? Has the Malaysian government so clearly lost the plot that even outside observers would recognize that the trial was blatantly political from day one? Within minutes of the verdict being issued, the Malaysian government issued a polished statement proclaiming the country's ""judicial independence"" and demanding ""all parties involved to respect the legal process and the judgment."" In case anyone didn't get the memo, there is the rapidly growing crackdown on dissent and free speech in Malaysia led by the top police officer -- who patrols the Twittersphere like a shark in open water and tweets orders to the police to arrest lawyers, activists and politicians using the country's draconian Sedition Act. A tweet by the cartoonist Zunar referencing ""lackeys in black robes"" has already landed him in court. This is supposed to be a big year for Malaysia, serving as chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) when the ASEAN Economic Community is to become a reality, and holding a seat at the UN Security Council. Malaysia is also a key partner in the US-driven Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade proposal that has gone to the top of the Obama legislative agenda, and it was Prime Minister Najib Razak who President Obama invited for a round of golf in Hawaii during the president's Christmas holiday. Whether the political persecution of Anwar was raised on the course has yet to come out. But there is huge gap between Malaysia's international engagements as a so-called ""moderate"" Muslim-majority nation and its domestic repression of opponents that sadly doesn't usually garner much attention -- except in instances when Malaysia imprisons a figure like Anwar who is widely respected and known internationally. So few people know Najib's government has been on a tear against his opponents since the 2013 elections, during which the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition lost the majority vote to the Anwar-lead Pakatan Rakyat coalition but maintained power because of gerrymandered election districts for parliamentary seats. Since then the government has been wielding the Sedition Act like a hammer, using its undefined terminology barring ""any seditious words"" or ""seditious tendency"" that would ""bring into hatred or contempt or excite disaffection against any Ruler or against any Government."" In the past two years, more than a dozen senior politicians and activists have been dragged into court for saying or tweeting things the government didn't like, and a number have fled overseas to seek asylum -- and the list is going to keep growing. Najib affirmed at the 2014 congress of the United Malays National Organization (UMNO) party that he leads that he's planning to strengthen the Sedition Act further when the Parliament reconvenes in March. Crackdowns on peaceful assemblies, restrictions on the media, censorship of books and films, and targeting of ethnic and religious minorities are also on the rise in Najib's Malaysia. Shaffee Abdullah, the same UMNO lawyer brought into as a special prosecutor in Anwar's case also serves as Malaysia's representative to the regional human rights body, the ASEAN Inter-governmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR), and asserts how he has prevented any discussions of LGBT rights there. Malaysia is brewing a heady concoction of authoritarianism and intolerance that should be setting off alarm bells in world capitals like Washington, London, Berlin, and Brussels. Anwar's conviction last week may be a new low for the Malaysia government's rights record, but it should not be seen in isolation from the growing intolerance for civil and political rights emanating from Putrajaya. The wider international community -- be it Malaysia's allies, foreign business investors, and the United Nations -- should wake up and recognize that the Malaysian government is changing and not for the better. It's time to support Malaysia's human rights defenders, and recognize that if the world wants a democratic, rights-respecting Malaysia, it's going to have to fight for it.","Opposition leader loses appeal against sodomy conviction, jailed for five years .

"(CNN)One of the brothers who committed January's massacre at the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo texted the man who would later kill hostages at a Paris kosher supermarket a little more than an hour before the first attack, French newspaper Le Monde reported Tuesday. Le Monde also reported that the January 7 Charlie Hebdo massacre nearly was canceled the day before, because one of the attackers was sick. The newspaper cited unnamed French investigative sources for both accounts. Le Monde reported that it didn't know the message's content, but said it helps to show the Charlie Hebdo attacks by Cherif and Said Kouachi and supermarket attack by Amedy Coulibaly were coordinated -- something that Coulibaly himself purportedly admitted to a TV reporter before police killed him. Cherif Kouachi sent a text message to Coulibaly at 10:19 a.m. on January 7, Le Monde reported. That is a little more than an hour before the Kouachi brothers assaulted the magazine offices in Paris, killing 12 people and injuring 11. Coulibaly, who authorities say was a known associate of the Kouachi brothers, shot a policewoman to death in a Paris suburb on January 8, and then took hostages -- killing four -- at a kosher supermarket in Paris on January 9 before police shot and killed him in a raid on the store. The Kouachi brothers were killed the same day, as police moved in to end a separate siege north of Paris. The January 7 text message was sent from Cherif Kouachi's phone on the outskirts of Paris to one of 13 phones that Coulibaly was using, according to Le Monde, citing its investigative sources. Le Monde said investigators determined that Coulibaly's phone was bought specifically to communicate with the Kouachi brothers, and that only six messages had been sent from the device. Evidence from the phone shows that Coulibaly and Cherif Kouachi probably met in person sometime before 1 a.m. on January 7, Le Monde reported. The investigative sources told Le Monde that the Charlie Hebdo attack almost was called off on January 6, because Said Kouachi had come down with the stomach flu. Al Qaeda's Yemen affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, has claimed to be behind the Charlie Hebdo massacre. Coulibaly, meanwhile, proclaimed his allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. Coulibaly, during the supermarket attack, told a journalist with CNN affiliate BFMTV by phone that he had synchronized his attacks with the Kouachi brothers, BFMTV reported.

"(CNN)Every morning, my children have to enter their preparatory school in London through a door that is inches thick. They and tens of thousands of other Jewish children across the continent have to pass by police officers with armed assault rifles and high walls laced with barbed wire. Even if there's the suspicion of an impending attack, classes can be canceled and people are told to stay away from noticeably Jewish institutions. After the recent attacks in Paris, the Grand Synagogue was closed for Sabbath services for the first time since the end of the Holocaust. Indeed, the situation has become so dire that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called on Jews in Europe to emigrate to Israel. While I understand this sentiment is coming from a place of concern, European Jews should not leave out of fear and should push their leaders to defeat anti-Semitism and radical Islamist terrorism. That said, none of this is surprising. After all, we've recently witnessed murderous terrorist attacks on the Jewish communities of Copenhagen, Denmark, and Paris, attacks that have shaken an already fearful community to its core. Each attack adds to the feelings of insecurity among European Jews and adds more levels of necessary security. As a result of the intensified wave of anti-Semitism and Islamist terrorism, Jews in Europe are eschewing Jewish identifying symbols and are afraid to attend prayers and to send their children to their Jewish schools. This has led to an unprecedented desire to leave their home countries and flee to greater freedom and security. But seeing schools doubling as high-security facilities sends a message to our children -- who are the next generation of European Jewry -- that their lives are in constant danger. Of course, it is understandable and natural that the authorities choose to take heightened security measures to prevent further loss of life. But the fight must be taken to the perpetrators rather than allowing it to infringe further upon the everyday lives of the victims. If, in the words of European leaders, they would like the Jews of Europe to stay and not to emigrate, then they must find a way to return a semblance of normalcy to the everyday lives of Jews across the continent. How? To defeat this bloody and belligerent strain of terrorism and the specter of radical Islamism and Jew-hatred, European authorities must be more proactive in hunting down terrorists before they act and not grant them a victory by further imposing restrictions on Europe's Jews. The threat is not country specific, so the response must be found in Europe as a union. European nations need to immediately and urgently come together to form a pan-European authority to deal with anti-Semitism and this new form of homegrown radical Islamist terrorism, with significant resources tasked with finding concrete practical solutions. The first step that has to be taken is to bolster and improve intelligence-gathering and sharing across Europe. The current system is neither efficient nor vigilant enough. Many of the perpetrators of the recent massacres of Jews were well-known to the police. Many crossed borders, seemingly with little trouble, before and after they committed their bloody acts. Police and law enforcement also need to be strengthened. This includes actively enforcing laws against incitement and anti-Semitic speech and taking a firmer approach against those who promote hate and violence. Enforcement authorities must enter and act within largely Muslim areas where police might ordinarily be reluctant to enter. Additionally, new legislation to combat radical Islamist terrorism and anti-Semitism must be passed. The reality is that Europe is dealing with a new threat using an infrastructure that was not built to deal with homegrown terrorists who run freely in Europe and kill people seemingly at will. In short, European authorities have to change the current mode of action and move from a paradigm of almost pure defense onto the attack. Our continent has known in the past how to deal with threats to our way of life, and as in the past, the best chance of victory is to be found in a continentwide unity of purpose. Any weakness in a European-wide response to this new threat -- not just to Jews, but also to the very essence that our union was built upon, like freedom of thought and speech -- will be exploited by the terrorists and their supporters. There are probably dozens of attacks at various stages of planning taking place in towns and cities across Europe. It is not enough just to increase security at any possible target, because this policy alone is not working and cannot be a long term answer. It is time Europe went on the offensive.","Moshe Kantor: Threat of extremism and anti-Semitism is not country specific .

"(CNN)Violent extremists like the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, have become increasingly sophisticated at creating dense, global networks of support online, networks that are helping these groups run virtual circles around governments and communities. And it is activities like these that have raised a disturbing prospect, one that has serious implications for fighting extremism: We could lose the information war. It's with this troubling reality in mind that the Obama administration will this week hold a Summit on Countering Violent Extremism, where it will underscore the importance of technology companies in the fight against terrorist recruitment. This is critical. As Robert Hannigan, director of Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (the National Security Agency's sister organization), emphasized, technology companies' services ""have become the command-and-control networks of choice for terrorists."" ISIS, in particular, has proven virulent in using technology to radicalize. It has mobilized armies of online followers to engage audiences in ways that take advantage of the decentralized and open nature of the Internet, leveraging online tools such as Twitter, Facebook, Ask.fm, Kik, SoundCloud and Instagram, to name just a few. Indeed, in a single day this past summer, ISIS supporters sent out some 40,000 tweets, and supporters often repetitively tweet specific hashtags at particular times of day to maximize message trending. ISIS also has strategically run hashtag campaigns to tap into trending topics on Twitter, such as the World Cup and Ebola, which have nothing to do with violent extremism. ISIS-linked extremists have used social media to focus group messages, disseminate ideological simulator games, and broadcast high production videos, and the group has created its own technologies, including a smartphone app released last year that amplifies its messaging campaigns. Governments are struggling to keep up. How should they respond? For a start, they need to leverage the talent, creativity and capabilities of the private sector. Yet involving technology companies in countering extremism will be challenging. True, the U.S. government has been engaging Google, Twitter, Facebook and other large companies on the problem since at least 2008. But while this has generated a few initiatives, such as social media training for Muslim Americans and the Network Against Violent Extremism online network catalyzed by Google Ideas, we have yet to see the scale of involvement required for strategic impact. Part of the challenge is that, although large companies clearly want to help, they have to navigate complicated priorities that distinguish them from governments, such as shareholders, profits, brands and market forces. Just as importantly, these high-profile companies could face real safety risks. When Twitter shut down ISIS-affiliated accounts last year, for example, a prominent ISIS supporter called for the assassination of Twitter employees. Given recent attacks in Paris and Sydney, these kinds of threats are chilling. The Obama administration will therefore need to figure out how to help companies navigate the inherent risks of the private sector countering violent extremism. One solution is to encourage the involvement of more agile start-ups that are willing to move into niche markets like countering extremist messaging. These companies are lean, hungry and less encumbered by the risk calculations that circumscribe large companies. Moreover, the start-up community is increasingly emphasizing social impact as a core business imperative, and this trend likely will accelerate as more millennials start new businesses. Interestingly, research shows that millennials place a premium on  investments that generate positive social impact. Just as importantly, the counter-extremism ""marketplace"" is in many ways better suited to small, flexible businesses than large companies. Radicalization is driven by a host of different factors (such as identity crises, a sense of disempowerment, a desire for adventure, and even misguided idealism), each of which represents a potential business opportunity. Large companies may not be interested in addressing these market needs if it takes them away from their core products and services, leaving room for a constellation of specialized start-ups. The Muslim youth market, in particular, is experiencing immense political, cultural and religious transformations, and many large companies are nervous about the volatility. As a result, the 500 million-strong Muslim youth market is woefully underserved. Start-ups, especially those from within Muslim communities, may be better positioned and motivated to address Muslim youth needs in a way that helps counter radicalization. At the White House Summit, the President will likely call on technology companies for help, and we encourage the administration to involve talented and passionate start-ups in addition to brand name companies. This week, to support the summit and facilitate greater private sector involvement, we will launch a specialized start-up incubator (Affinis Labs) and are forming a $5 million private equity fund for start-ups involved in countering extremism. The reality is that ISIS operates like a mission-driven, agile start-up to spread its evil ideology, and we will not defeat it through government and large corporations alone. America is the vanguard of entrepreneurship and innovation, and there are start-ups ready to heed President Obama's call, including start-ups led by passionate Muslim Americans who are building businesses and social enterprises that challenge violent extremist narratives. We believe firmly that American entrepreneurs are ready to support the fight against radicalization.","White House is holding Summit on Countering Violent Extremism this week .

"Copenhagen (CNN)Denmark was on edge Tuesday, as it emerged that the suspected gunman in the weekend terror attacks in Copenhagen apparently swore allegiance to ISIS' leader, and armed police responded to a bomb scare at the scene of one of the shootings. Police cordoned off the area around the Krudttoenden Cafe while they investigated what was thought to be a suspicious letter left only steps away from the banks of flowers left as a memorial. After the letter was checked out by military bomb disposal units, police declared the all-clear. But the sight of barricades, sniffer dogs and bomb disposal officers will have done little to ease the city's frayed nerves. The latest developments . News that the suspected gunman swore fidelity to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a posting made on what's apparently his Facebook page just before the shooting spree began Saturday will also disturb many. The post pledges ""allegiance to Abu Bakr in full obedience in the good and bad things. And I won't dispute with him unless it is an outrageous disbelief."" A Facebook friend of the shooter told CNN he believed the page, which has since been deleted, matched the profile of his friend. The suspect in the attack has been named as Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein, a senior member of the Danish government said. The gunman opened fire at a free-speech forum at the cafe before shooting several people outside a synagogue, and then firing at police. Police killed him in the shootout. While police haven't formally released the name of the gunman, they said he was a 22-year-old man born in Denmark. Authorities said he was ""well-known by the police for several criminal incidents,"" including weapons violations and violence. Police also said he was ""known in connection to gangs."" The Danish Security and Intelligence Service, PET, also confirmed Tuesday that it received a report from the Danish prison service last year warning that the suspect was at risk of radicalization. However, based on that report, PET ""did not have reason to believe that the now deceased 22-year-old was planning an attack,"" the statement said. Anti-Semitism in Europe: Will it cause Jews to leave? The report was made as part of a system set up to ensure that authorities can take preventive measures if prison inmates are identified as being in danger of being radicalized. Charges have been filed against two men who are accused of helping to hide the gunman, the men's attorney said Monday. Lawyer Michael Eriksen said the men, 19 and 22, were charged with two counts of accessory to murder and five counts of accessory to attempted murder. Eriksen told CNN that the two, who pleaded not guilty, have not been charged under Denmark's anti-terrorism laws. The nation began the healing process Monday night with a candlelight vigil at which Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt appealed for national unity. Authorities estimated more than 40,000 attended the event. ""An attack on Denmark's Jews is an attack on everyone,"" she said. ""The Jewish community is an important part of Denmark. We will stand together and continue the everyday life we know. We stand together as Danes."" Lars Vilks, a Swedish artist who attended Saturday's forum, says he thinks he was probably the target of the attack. He escaped unharmed and told CNN on Monday he has gone into hiding. Vilks, known for his controversial depictions of the Prophet Mohammed, is on an al Qaeda hit list. He declined to specify when he first went into hiding and said he is not afraid. By the end of the melee at the cafe, the gunman had wounded three officers and killed a 55-year-old man. The Danish Film Institute said he was director Finn Noergaard. The second victim was a man providing security for a bat mitzvah party taking place behind a Copenhagen synagogue. The Jewish Society of Denmark identified the deceased as Dan Uzan, 37. He is due to be laid to rest Thursday at the Mosaiske Vestre Jewish cemetery, the society said. The funeral will be open to all.

"Irbil, Iraq (CNN)After hours of heavy fighting, Kurdish fighters in Iraq have repelled an assault by ISIS fighters southwest of Irbil, Kurdish officials said. Kurdish commanders say ISIS fighters had threatened to overrun Kurdish defensive positions in the area for a while, and the two sides were so close that airstrikes were not possible. But by 3 a.m. local time Wednesday, the Peshmerga had succeeded in forcing ISIS back, allowing airstrikes to begin. The commanders said about 40 ISIS fighters were killed, and Kurdish forces suffered several casualties. They said airstrikes contributed to the ISIS deaths. ISIS launched the major assault from several directions Tuesday night near the towns of Gwer and Makhmour. The towns are about 45 kilometers (28 miles) from Irbil, the Kurdish capital. A CNN team was in the area less than two weeks ago and was told by fighters at the front that ISIS was making almost daily attempts to infiltrate through Kurdish lines, which are strung out along a stretch of the River Zab. Fortifications are few and far between. Volunteer fighters have very little in the way of weaponry. In January, nearly 30 Peshmerga fighters were killed in the area by a surprise ISIS attack across the river. Kurdish fighters battle equipment woes as well as ISIS in northern Iraq . Kurdish officials said they were concerned ISIS fighters would break through their lines. Had that happened, there would be little standing between ISIS and the Kurdish capital. Tuesday's attacks were likely aimed at drawing the already stretched Kurdish forces in many different directions to relieve the pressure on Mosul, which ISIS seized in June. Kurdish forces recently have been trying to surround Mosul to cut off ISIS' lines of supply from Syria, setting up what could be an eventual assault to try to expel the terror group from the city.

"(CNN)Texas A&M's Corps of Cadets, the nation's largest, will be under the command of a woman next year for the first time ever, the school announced on Monday. Corps Sgt. Maj. Alyssa Marie Michalke, 20, will take command on May 9. Michalke is a junior with a dual major in ocean and civil engineering. ""I am deeply honored to have been selected to serve as the next Corps Commander and will do my very best to uphold the tradition of leading my fellow cadets, while also continuing to learn and grow,"" Michalke said in a news release from the school. The Corps of Cadets is over 2,400 members strong, with units including the band and the official honor guard for the governor of Texas. Many know the Corps for its Fightin' Texas Aggie Band, a precision military band that plays at many of Texas A&M's football games. But at the core of the Corps, its mission is to prepare men and women for leadership roles in two U.S. service branches. All members of the corps take ROTC courses their freshman and sophomore years. The Corps has specialized units to prepare cadets for the elite Army Rangers or Navy SEALs. More cadets have been commissioned into the armed services from Texas A&M than any other university in the nation, with the exception of the service academies themselves. Seven members of the Corps who joined the military have been awarded the Medal of Honor, given to American soldiers who display conspicuous ""gallantry above and beyond the call of duty."" Michalke will be the first women to lead the Corps since the school's founding 139 years ago. She ""was selected because she was the best cadet for the position, not because she is female,"" Brig. Gen. Joe Ramirez Jr., commandant of the Corps, said in a release. While Michalke will take command of the Corps, she won't be its highest ranking member. That honor is reserved for Reveille, a pure-bred American collie who is also the mascot for the school and is taken care of by Corps Company E-2. School tradition requires that if Reveille falls asleep on a cadet's bed, that cadet must sleep on the floor.","Alyssa Marie Michalke will take command of the Corps in May .

"Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton has sought advice from dozens of people over the past several months in the run up to a likely presidential bid, but one such source stands out from the rest: Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Clinton has reached out to the Massachusetts senator ""several times"" over the past six months, a source with knowledge of Clinton's plans told CNN on Tuesday, a sign of how important Warren's wing of the Democratic party is to the foundation of a would-be presidential bid for the former secretary of state. The two met privately at the former secretary of state's Washington, D.C. home in December, according to the source, and have talked on the phone, as well. The New York Times first reported the December meeting on Tuesday. ""Secretary Clinton really values Senator Warren and has reached out several times over the past six months,"" the source added. The senator's office has not responded to questions about the meeting. The Clinton-Warren relationship is part of the former first lady's months-long process of soliciting ideas and seeking advice from leading Democrats as she prepares for an all-but-certain 2016 run. Since the 2014 midterms, Clinton has prepared for 2016 by meeting and talking with top Democrats about the strategy, tactics and policy that would make a possible Clinton run in 2016 campaign successful. But the meetings and phone calls are also seemingly an attempt by Clinton to satisfy what has been persistent calls from the left for the 2016 Democratic nominee to focus on income inequality, Wall Street reform and raising up the middle class. Warren, who is seen as the heart and soul of the Democratic left on those issues, has been the focus of a few draft campaigns since the 2014 midterms. Left leaning groups like Democracy for America and MoveOn.org, as well as the new Ready for Warren campaign, have knocked Clinton's centrism and created sometimes negative headlines for the Democratic frontrunner. Although the senator has repeatedly disavowed the efforts and said she will not run for president in 2016, she will undoubtedly direct some of the presidential conversation from her perch in the Senate and if they are not satisfied and courted, her supporters could continue to be an annoyance for Clinton. Erica Sagrans, the Ready for Warren campaign manager, said Tuesday that the meeting is another sign Clinton ""is among a growing number of Democratic leaders who admire"" Warren's liberal positions. ""This is why we're calling on Warren to run for president in 2016 -- so that we have a real Democratic primary debate about the issues that matter, and so voters can get behind a fearless champion for working families,"" Sagrans added. The Clinton-Warren meetings and calls also show growth in a relationship that looked awkward in 2014. While campaigning for Massachusetts' Democratic gubernatorial candidate in October, Clinton was effusive in her praise for Warren, labeling her ""the passionate champion for working people and middle class families."" ""I love watching Elizabeth,"" Clinton added, touting her ability to ""you know, give it those who deserve to get it."" Warren, however, wasn't so effusive and barely mentioned the former secretary of state who was headlining the event. ""Happy to welcome Secretary Clinton back to the commonwealth,"" Warren said, firing up the crowd. ""We love it!""

"President Barack Obama pardoned the national Thanksgiving turkey with a smile on Wednesday, but he admitted before saving the bird from it's likely demise that he found the decades-old tradition somewhat ""puzzling."" ""It is a little puzzling that I do this every year, but I will say that I enjoy it because with all the tough stuff that swirls around in this office it's nice once in a while just to say, 'Happy Thanksgiving,'"" he said. And with a wink and a nod, the president also made joking reference to the controversy dogging his administration over his unilateral move to offer protection from deportation to some 5 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally. ""I am here to announce what I'm sure will be the most talked about executive action this month. Today I am taking an action that is fully within my legal authority,"" he said to laughter from the crowd, in reference not to the immigration move, but the turkey pardon. Joined by his teenage daughters, Obama went on to pardon Cheese, the turkey chosen by Americans as this year's national Thanksgiving turkey via Twitter. The nearly 50-pound snow-white turkey calmly accepted the president's pardon as flashbulbs burst and officials looked on. Cheese and his alternate turkey, Mac, were both raised by National Turkey Federation Chairman Gary Cooper's son Cole, both of whom were in attendance at the ceremony Wednesday. The two 20-week-old turkeys will enjoy a much more tranquil Thanksgiving than many of their fellow fowl, as they're headed to ""Turkey Hill"" the historic turkey farm at Morven Park, the Leesburg, Va., home of former Virginia Gov. Westmoreland Davis, according to the White House. There, they'll be on display for visitors seeking a second-degree brush with the president. Though the event is meant as an opportunity for the president to express a bit of Thanksgiving cheer, it's not without controversy. Earlier this month, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals called on Obama's daughters to encourage their father to end the ""offensive turkey pardon"" and go vegan for the holiday. But the tradition, which the National Turkey Federation says has been around since President Harry Truman, went on. Obama will also volunteer with his family on Wednesday, another longstanding presidential Thanksgiving tradition. Other elected officials got in the spirit of the holiday on Wednesday, tweeting out their favorite Thanksgiving recipes. House Speaker John Boehner revealed the details of his special ""Boehner Brine,"" while Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted her family's chocolate mousse recipe.","President Barack Obama pardons Cheese, this year's national Thanksgiving turkey .

"(CNN)After the United States-led coalition has battled the Islamic State, firing thousands of airstrikes across Iraq and Syria, the terrorist group that aims to establish a brutal Caliphate is gaining ground -- literally. While there is an example of ISIS' brutality nearly every day, terrorism experts such as CNN's Peter Bergen and Tim Lister remind us Tuesday that it's critical to look at the big and frightening picture of what's happening. Bergen explains what ISIS is after in this CNN story Tuesday -- the end times, the apocalypse. It's high time, Bergen argues, that the United States and others stop trying to rationalize ISIS' behavior as rational. Lister breaks down how and why ISIS is gaining momentum in many other countries besides Iraq and Syria. ISIS fighters launched a major assault Tuesday night southwest of Irbil, Kurdish officials said. A ""big attack"" is taking place near the towns of Gwer and Makhmour, one Kurdish source told CNN. The towns are some 45 kilometers (28 miles) from Irbil, the Kurdish capital. Kurdish officials said they were concerned ISIS fighters would break through their lines. If that happens, there would be little standing between ISIS and the Kurdish capital, though Tuesday's attacks are likely aimed at drawing the already stretched Kurdish forces in many different directions to relieve the pressure on Mosul, which ISIS seized in June. There appears to be growing support within the United States to use force against ISIS and increasing dissatisfaction about how President Barack Obama's administration has dealt with the group. A new CNN/ORC survey found that 57% of the Americans questioned disapprove of how Obama is handling the threat. In late September, 49% said they disapproved of the administration's strategy. Fifty-four percent of 1,027 people polled between February 12-15 said they disapproved of how the president is handling terrorism in general. Seventy-three percent said they support the use of force against ISIS. CNN's Senior Political Analyst Ron Brownstein said he was surprised to see that 47% of the people polled said they approve of sending ground forces to fight ISIS. Whether that's a true portrayal of how Americans feel is unclear, he noted. The poll comes as ISIS beheaded 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians this weekend in Libya and put the video of the slayings online, a well-worn propaganda tactic the extremists often use. And yet support for the terror group is growing among some citizens in Egypt, which is often called the cradle of the Middle East. The murders of the Christian minority group took place in Libya, where ISIS is also establishing a strong following in the absence of a stable government in that nation. The country has been in turmoil since the Arab Spring demonstrations that ultimately led to the overthrow of dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Egypt reacted to the slayings with a fiery air campaign against ISIS in Libya. Yemen has never been a stable place, and ISIS is exploiting that and establishing a fan base there. ISIS also has followers in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Lister noted. The leader of Boko Haram, which has ravaged northern Nigeria, has said he admires ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Last week, a top U.S. counterterrorism official warned that the number of foreign fighters joining the ranks of ISIS is growing at an alarming rate, and that scores of them are from the United States. On another front in Europe, the battle against ISIS has manifested in so-called lone wolf actors staging attacks. CNN reported that a gunman who had sworn allegiance to ISIS murdered a filmmaker and later a synagogue guard in Copenhagen, Denmark, over the weekend. Nerves are still frayed in the city as police on Tuesday cordoned off the area around a cafe. The gathering there Saturday was intended to be a forum on freedom of expression in the wake of the Paris Charlie Hebdo attack. Swedish artist Lars Vilks was at the cafe. Years ago he drew the Prophet Mohammed as a dog, an act that landed him on a terrorist hit list. Watch why images of the prophet are so offensive to some Muslims . Vilks told CNN that someone saved his life at the cafe by shoving him into a storage room. On Tuesday, the artist told CNN's Anderson Cooper that he felt he had no other choice but to go into hiding. The gunman's motives may be tied to a suspicious letter left only steps away from a bank of flowers in a memorial near the cafe. Read more about the prohibition of drawing the prophet . A post on Facebook that allegedly belonged to the shooter read, ""allegiance to Abu Bakr in full obedience in the good and bad things. And I won't dispute with him unless it is an outrageous disbelief."" A Facebook friend of the suspect, 22-year-old Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein, told CNN he believed the page matched El-Hussein's profile. On Tuesday, the Danish Security and Intelligence Service confirmed that it received a report from the Danish prison service last year warning that El-Hussein was at risk of radicalization. El-Hussein was killed in a shootout with police after the killing at the synagogue. The United States is considering providing teams of moderate Syrian rebels with the capability to call in U.S. airstrikes via GPS, a U.S. defense official told CNN. But a decision hasn't yet been made on that possibility, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Even if that capability is provided, the United States would not conduct any airstrikes without some sort of additional confirming intelligence, independent of the Syrian rebels, the official said. It could be part of a U.S. plan to provide the Syrian rebel teams with a variety of gear to carry out the task of defending local areas from ISIS, and eventually being able to conduct offensive operations, the official said. The gear is expected to include pickups, machine guns, communications and GPS equipment, the official said. It is also expected that mortars will be provided. No decision has been made yet on providing more sophisticated anti-tank weapons. The first American trainers are expected in Jordan at the beginning of March. Training sessions are expected to last six to eight weeks. The official would not say how many teams will be outfitted, although the United States hopes to train about 5,000 rebel forces. Also on Tuesday, the White House convened a three-day Summit on Countering Violent Extremism. At least 60 nations are participating. Tuesday's agenda will focus on three cities -- Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Boston -- that have pilot programs to battle extremism. Officials and leaders from those cities will share what they've learned. Who is doing what in the global coalition against ISIS? CNN's Barbara Starr, Tim Lister and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.

"Gold medals are the pinnacle of achievement for the 26 Olympic sports contested at the Games. Athletes get one shot every four years to make history: but time, dedication, guile and application must combine for the opportunity to be seized. Sometimes, however, even this is not enough to be crowned the world's best. Visualize running the race of your life as part of a four-man relay team, being acknowledged as winners to the world but never receiving the coveted medallion of precious medal. Imagine this happened 12 years ago to a team from a nation that has only ever won two gold medals previously and that, despite the official nature of the result, the wait goes on. Picture that in the intervening time, between the event and the present day, you have buried one of your teammates, a man who died at the age of 42 without ever touching the gold he rightfully won. This is the story of Nigeria's 4 x 400m runner Jude Monye. Monye was born in Onicha-Ugbo, Delta State, Nigeria and ran the 400m in 45.16 at his prime at the 1995 World Championships in Gothenburg. His talent was so prodigious as a youth he won a scholarship to train and study in the United States at the University of Mississippi and, after an injury-plagued experience at the Atlanta Games of 1996, then qualified to run for his nation again at Sydney 2000. And it was in Australia that Monye, running in the Nigerian relay team of Clement Chukwu, Sunday Bada and Enefiok Udo-Obong, reached his zenith of performance on the track. The greatest . ""That relay team was the greatest,"" Monye, 38, told CNN, at ""Nigeria House"" a theater close to the Olympic Park in East London, themed in all things west African for the duration of the 2012 Games. ""Previously there had always been a weak member in the relay team, but when myself and Clement joined Sunday, and then Enefiok came into the side, we knew we were strong. We knew something special could happen."" The tale of Nigeria's only gold medal in the 4 x 400m is one as packed with drama as it is delays. Going into the race,  the Nigerians had reason to feel pleased with their performance so far.  For a nation that had never won a medal in the 400m -- its two other golds came from football and long jump in 1996 -- the team won their semifinal to book a place in lane four. In lane five, the outright favorites, Team USA: Antonio Pettigrew, Alvin and Calvin Harrison and anchored by one of America's greatest ever sprinters Michael Johnson, who had already taken gold in the individual 400m. Monye would race the second leg against Pettigrew. ""On the day of the final, I woke up feeling relaxed and thought 'I feel good, let's see what happens.' All the attention from our sports ministry was on the women's team, they were thought to be the big medal hope, nobody really paid attention to us. ""And we only got the fifth fastest time in the semifinals, remember, but we had trust in ourselves. We knew we could deliver."" Nigeria were in fifth when Monye clasped the baton for the second leg. By the final meter, Udo-Obong had dipped his head into second place with an overall time of 2:58.68. ""It was the race of our lives,"" Monye told CNN. ""It's the best 4 x 400m I ever ran, and we still hold the African record."" While the runners from the most populous nation in Africa beat Jamaica to second, the Americans topped the podium and had gold medals draped around their necks, a crowning glory for the team and Johnson -- a winner in the individual 200m and 400m in Sydney -- in particular.But the golds would have a restless destiny. Dope and displaced gold . In 2004 the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) ruled that Jerome Young, an American sprinter who ran for the States in the 4 x 400 semifinal, had been ineligible to compete, a decision that would see the medals taken from the quartet and the result erased from the record books. Under appeal, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) overturned the ruling and allowed the USA to keep their medals, but not for long. For in May 2008, in the trial of former running coach Trevor Graham, Pettigrew testified he had used performance enhancing drugs (EPO and human growth hormone) under Graham's tutelage during the Sydney Games. Graham was subsequently sentenced to one-year's house arrest for perjury while Pettigrew suffered a two-year ban from competition. In the wake of the admission both Pettigrew and Johnson returned their gold medals voluntarily to the IOC in June of that year, before the Olympic Committee confirmed the American abrogation. Their decision came within a whisker of breaching the ""statute limitations"" of 8 years, after which there is no legal basis for retrospective change to such results. ""For eight years I could say I was a five-time Olympic gold medalist. Then I had to start saying four-time. It doesn't sound the same,"" an angry Johnson told British newspaper The Daily Telegraph in July, 2012. Pettigrew committed suicide in 2010. The golds were no longer in the possession of the USA runners, but they still were far from the Nigerians' grasp. The long wait ... Four more years passed -- while the IOC waited to see if any further information would surface from American doping investigations -- before the body's executive board to award the gold medals to the west Africans. On July 20, 2012 as the IOC convened ahead of the London Games, Nigeria were proclaimed gold medal winners of the Sydney Olympics' 4x400m relay. Sadly, the decision came too late for Bada, who died suddenly, of a suspected cardiac arrest, in December 2011, after collapsing at the National Stadium in Lagos. ""The day before he died I called him to talk about the medals, so it's sad we've lost him. The IOC should have made this a priority, it's very frustrating,"" Monye said. ""It was sad we didn't get to hear the Nigerian national anthem during the Olympics, but especially for my friend Sunday. He's not here to get the medal. That in itself is sad."" According to Monye, the three remaining athletes are still unaware of how and when the medals will be given to them. ""I'm disappointed in the IOC and the Nigerian Olympic Committee (NOC). I spoke to the Nigerian sports minister last week and he said to me 'Congratulations Jude, when are you getting your gold medal?' I said 'Sir, you're asking me?' I've heard nothing since. ""It would have been nice to get our medals in the stadium in London, but I'm not sure this has happened in the Olympics before. This is very rare, so there is no protocol."" In response the IOC told CNN in a statement: ""The presentation of the medals falls under the remit of the NOC, we suggest that you contact the Nigeria Olympic Committee directly for further details."" When CNN did, Tunde Popoola -- the Secretary General of the Nigerian Olympic Committee said: ""We cannot respond to the questions raised at this time."" Though doubt remains over when Monye, Udo-Obong and Chukwu will receive their coveted prize, the meaning it will have to those involved and a nation of avid athletics fans does not. ""Nigeria loves the Olympics especially track and field, it would mean so much for the country. The medal could now be dedicated to Bada and we're hoping his son could pick up the medal for him instead.""","Nigeria's 4 x 400m team were awarded victory when Team USA's gold was rescinded .

"Hong Kong (CNN)China is building a ""significant presence"" in disputed waters in the South China Sea through land reclamation, new analysis shows. Satellite images from late January analyzed by IHS Jane's Defence Weekly show that China is reclaiming a significant amount of land at three sites in the Spratly Islands, in addition to two other sites previously documented by the defense publication. ""Where it used to have a few, small concrete platforms, it now has full islands with helipads, airstrips, harbors, and facilities to support large numbers of troops,"" James Hardy, Jane's Asia Pacific editor, told CNN. ""We can see that this is a methodical, well-planned campaign to create a chain of air and sea capable fortresses across the center of the Spratly Islands chain."" In November, the publication reported that China was building an ""air strip capable"" island at least 3,000 meters long on Fiery Cross Reef. The South China Sea is the subject of numerous rival -- often messy -- territorial claims, with China, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam disputing sovereignty of several island chains and nearby waters. The areas in dispute include fertile fishing grounds and potentially rich reserves of undersea natural resources. The latest images show for the first time reclamation at Hughes Reef -- a ""large facility"" is being constructed on 75,000 square meters of reclaimed land. Jane's also said that significant progress has been made at Johnson South and Gaven Reefs. ""The buildings on Hughes Reef and Gaven Reefs have almost identical footprints: that of a main square building with what appears to be an anti-aircraft tower or radome at each corner. ""This suggests that China has standardized the design of key facilities and is rolling it out across its new islands."" Hardy said that Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines, which also claim the disputed archipelago, are modifying existing islands but not reclaiming land on a large scale. He said the reclamation would technically do little to bolster China's claims to the islands under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea because these have to be based on naturally occurring features. ""That said, if China's on the ground and is heavily armed, then it is going to be nigh on impossible for anyone to challenge or remove it, so international law is moot on this one,"" Hardy said. China's Ministry of Defense didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.","China is building islands in disputed waters in the South China Sea .

"(CNN)Call it ""The War of the Rose."" Amber Rose and Khloe Kardashian had it out on social media Monday, and it was something to behold. It all appears to have started when model Rose appeared on New York's Power 105.1 morning show and was asked about a reported relationship between reality star Kardashian's younger sister Kylie Jenner and rapper Tyga. Rose, who is the ex-girlfriend of Kardashian's now-brother-in-law Kanye West, said she believes Jenner, 17, is too young for the 25-year-old rapper. ""She's a baby. She needs to go to bed at 7 o'clock and relax,"" said Rose, who is also good friends with the mother of Tyga's infant son. ""That's ridiculous. (Tyga) should be ashamed of himself."" Rose added that while she doesn't respect the Kardashian/Jenner clan, she doesn't hate them, either. Kardashian then took to Twitter to point out that Rose said during the interview that she started stripping at the age of 15 and to request that Rose stop talking about her family. That's when Rose unleashed the shade by pointing out that although she may have stripped, West's wife, Kim Kardashian, is well-known for having a sex tape. She also showed the clan what can happen when you mess with a  girl from South Philly. Kardashian then spoke out to say that Rose's response just proved her point. But Rose had the last word, posting a screen shot of what appeared to be Kardashian liking a post of a leaked nude photo of Rose.

"(CNN)Starting on Ash Wednesday, more than 1 billion Christians around the world will enter the season of Lent, a time of solemn spiritual preparation for Easter, the culmination of the church's calendar. Despite its ancient history (Lent became standardized in the Catholic Church around the year 325) myths about Lenten traditions abound. Here are five of the most common, as well as one fact that may surprise you. Myth 1: Lent is 40 days . Counting from Ash Wednesday to Holy Saturday, there are 46 days. Then why do we always refer to the 40 days of Lent? The 40 days of fasting during Lent do not include Sundays. Every Sunday Christians commemorate the day of Christ's resurrection, thus, Sunday by its nature is a day of joy and celebration. The Sundays during Lent are not prescribed days of fasting and abstinence, so meat is permitted. Myth 2: Lent ends on Easter Sunday . Lent ends on Holy Thursday. The season of Lent begins on Ash Wednesday, February 18 this year, and ends on Holy Thursday, April 2, which commemorates Jesus' last supper with his disciples. As stated in the Catholic Church's ""General Norms for the Liturgical Year and the Calendar,"" the Easter triduum (Latin for ""three days"") begins with the evening Mass of the Lord's Supper, and includes Good Friday and Holy Saturday. It closes with evening prayer on Easter Sunday. Myth 3:  Catholics abstain from meat during Lent . Only on Fridays during Lent are Catholics required to abstain from meat in remembrance of the sacrifice Jesus made on Good Friday. According to abstinence laws, meat includes warm-blooded animals and birds. Fish and other cold-blooded animals are not prohibited. Local Catholic bishops may determine specific prescripts about what foods are included in abstinence. This can lead to interesting exceptions. For instance, in the Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit, eating muskrat is allowable on Fridays during Lent. Puffin, beaver and alligator are permissible in some places, too -- provided your local butcher has good connections! Myth 4: The Pope decides the date of Easter . Thanks in part to astronomers who figured out when all full moons would occur, for nearly 1,700 years Easter has fallen on the first Sunday after the Paschal, or Passover, full moon. The earliest possible date of Easter is March 22, and the latest is April 25.This year Easter is on April 5. The way to calculate the date of Easter was determined at a meeting of church bishops and others called the Council of Nicea in 325  near Constantinople in what is now modern day Turkey. Myth 5: Jesus went into the desert for 40 days before he was put to death . Actually, Jesus spent 40 days in the desert before beginning his public ministry, several years before he was crucified. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke -- individual, yet similar, interpretations of Christ's message -- each tell of Jesus spending 40 days in the desert, where he fasted, prayed and was tempted by the devil.  After this he went to Galilee where he called his first disciples and began his public ministry. The 40 days of Lent are a time to remember and imitate the life and ministry of Jesus as Christians prepare to commemorate his death and resurrection at Easter. Fact : Since 1975, American Catholics have donated $250 million during Lent to feed the hungry around the world . Catholic Relief Service's Rice Bowl project began in Allentown, Pennsylvania, 40 years ago, when Americans began to take up a collection to help a famine in West Africa. More than 13,000 faith communities participated in CRS Rice Bowl last Lent.","Despite its ancient history, myths about Lent abound .

Carmen, a 9-year-old boxer, went home Monday with Phil Ledford and his wife Elizabeth after two weeks of 24-hour care at an animal hospital. Phil Ledford's brother Ben Ledford was Carmen's original owner.  He died in a February 5 fire.  Phil Ledford said the homecoming is bittersweet. ""It'll be tough in that sense, seeing Carmen everyday, because she will remind me of Ben,"" Phil Ledford told CNN affiliate WCPO. ""But it'll be like having a piece of him around,"" he said. First responders to the fire found Carmen on top of Ben Ledford, trying to shelter his face from the heat, smoke and flame, according to WCPO. Ledford, 33, was taken to a hospital where he died. Carmen ended up at Cincinnati's Care Center, a critical care veterinary hospital where she has been ever since. Carmen was initially battling severe lung damage and smoke inhalation, Dr. Daniel Carey, a vet at the hospital, told WCPO. Carmen was able to come off oxygen support over the weekend and has been eating on her own, according to a post on the Facebook page of the animal hospital Care Center Vets in Cincinnati. ""We will all miss her sweet, loving face (and kisses), but we are so glad she is able to be home with her family tonight,"" the post said. Fans of Carmen have donated more than $29,000 toward the $25,000 goal for the care of the boxer on the Crowdrise website. Many dog lovers posted messages with their donations. ""We have a boxer baby, and this act of devotion is not surprising,"" Don and Lukasz Mallory wrote Friday on the crowdfunding site.  ""Prayers to the family for their loss and to Carmen for a fast recovery. If a dog can be this devoted to a human being, how much more should we be to each other."" Phil Ledford said he knows his brother would be happy to see Carmen ""healthy and happy."" ""We still cannot find the words to truly express how much we appreciate the support we've received from everyone for Ben, the family and for Carmen,"" Phil Ledford said on the crowdfunding site. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Carmen was critically injured February 5 .

"(CNN)Circumstantial evidence is in dire need of a public relations agency. Often described as weak and unconvincing, it is continually bashed by criminal defense attorneys as being synonymous with reasonable doubt. It enjoys none of the glamour of its attractive twin sisters DNA and scientifically based forensic evidence, who even get their own TV shows. In truth, though, circumstantial evidence can sometimes be compelling and highly reliable. When combined with a touch of supporting direct evidence it can be the strongest of all cases as it does not rely on frequently unreliable eyewitnesses. As prosecutors often say in their summations, circumstantial evidence has no motive to lie and no problem with its eyesight. In a Massachusetts' courtroom, the murder trial of former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez in the death of Odin Lloyd may prove to be a textbook study of circumstantial evidence and its struggle to overcome reasonable doubt and celebrity status. Prosecutors are meticulously building a case using surveillance video and other evidence to link Hernandez to the killing. Surveillance video already publicly disclosed depicts a pre-homicide meeting between Hernandez and his friends Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, also charged in the case, at the  Hernandez home in North Attleboro. Hernandez is seen walking around with a gun and then departing with his two pals in what appears to be a Nissan Altima. Later video shows Hernandez, Ortiz and Wallace making a fuel stop where driver Hernandez purchases what will later prove to be a very important pack of bubble gum. Prosecutors assert that a trail of text messages and more  surveillance  video, this time from a vantage point across the street from Lloyd's apartment, show Lloyd entering the vehicle in response to a Hernandez invite. Later at a time consistent with the time necessary to travel from Lloyd's apartment, a vehicle is seen entering a remote industrial park approximately a mile from the Hernandez home. Roughly three minutes after shots were heard by workers in the vicinity, the Hernandez Altima with no Lloyd in sight pulls into the Hernandez garage. A jury visit to the scene demonstrates the distance from the industrial park to the Hernandez home can be covered in three minutes.   Three men exit the vehicle and the driver, Hernandez, pulls what prosecutors say is a gun from his waistband. The video is unclear, howls the defense; it might be a cell phone. Lloyd's body, riddled by .45 caliber bullets, is found in the industrial park.  Prosecutors say they have more video showing Hernandez's fiancée throwing out a trash bag under suspicious circumstances. They say she was ditching the murder weapon to help the father of her child.  And for the coup de grace, the bubble gum reappears. A chewed piece of the gum is found in a rental car company trash container stuck to a .45 caliber shell casing consistent with the ammunition used to kill Lloyd. The defense asserts problems with how this evidence was recovered but the jury may believe that the gum and DNA link Hernandez to the murder weapon, which was not recovered. Prosecutors say DNA testing links the bubblegum bullet casing to Hernandez.  Both the gum and casing were recovered by a rental car employee during a cleaning of the rental Nissan Altima allegedly used in the killing and then placed in the trash container. And by the way, the car had dirt on its tires and side panels consistent with the dirt in the industrial park. Under Massachusetts' joint venture law, all those acting in concert to assist in a murder are guilty. No need to prove who was the triggerman -- or even a motive, which is conspicuously missing in the prosecution's pile of evidence.   Prosecutors promise even more evidence hinting that this is a slam dunk circumstantial case. But is any circumstantial murder case a ""slam dunk"" case? Here is what Massachusetts' judges customarily tell the jury about circumstantial evidence at the end of a criminal case: . ""You have direct evidence where a witness testifies directly about the fact that is to be proved, based on what he claims to have seen or heard or felt with his own senses, and the only question is whether you believe the witness. ..."" In the case of circumstantial evidence, the jury is asked to draw ""reasonable inferences"" from facts presented.  The ""mailman analogy""  is used in Massachusetts to demonstrate the concept: . ""Your daughter might tell you one morning that she sees the mailman at your mailbox. That is direct evidence that the mailman has been to your house. On the other hand, she might tell you only that she sees mail in the mailbox. That is circumstantial evidence that the mailman has been there; no one has seen him, but you can reasonably infer that he has been there since there is mail in the box. ..."" New York and several other states use variations of the rain analogy, which goes as follows: . ""Suppose ... the witness testified that it was clear as she walked to the subway, that she went into the subway and got on the train and that while she was on the train, she saw passengers come in at one station after another carrying wet umbrellas and wearing wet clothes and raincoats.  That testimony constitutes direct evidence of what the witness observed.  And because an inference that it was raining in the area would flow naturally, reasonably, and logically from that direct evidence, the witness' testimony would constitute circumstantial evidence that it was raining in the area."" (From New York model criminal jury instructions) The judge, in a Massachusetts case, then will warn the jury to be careful: . ""There are two things to keep in mind about circumstantial evidence: The first one is that you may draw inferences and conclusions only from facts that have been proved to you. The second rule is that any inferences or conclusions which you draw must be reasonable and natural, based on your common sense and experience of life. In a chain of circumstantial evidence, it is not required that every one of your inferences and conclusions be inevitable, but it is required that each of them be reasonable, that they all be consistent with one another, and that together they establish the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If the Commonwealth's case is based solely on circumstantial evidence, you may find the defendant guilty only if those circumstances are conclusive enough to leave you with a moral certainty, a clear and settled belief, that the defendant is guilty and that there is no other reasonable explanation of the facts as proven. The evidence must not only be consistent with the defendant's guilt, it must be inconsistent with his (her) innocence."" It's still early in the Hernandez trial, but with surveillance video, the evidence of dirt from the industrial park on the Hernandez car, the bullet-riddled body of Odin Lloyd, the alleged removal of the murder weapon from the Hernandez house in a trash bag by his already perjury-indicted fiancée, it appears that rain may be in the forecast when the trial concludes in the coming weeks. In the absence of some defense-produced sunshine, Hernandez may soon discover that the mailman also delivers to the MCI-Cedar Junction state prison at Walpole. Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described details of the bubble gum recovered at a rental car location and cited as evidence in the case.","Paul Callan: Prosecutors can often make compelling cases without direct evidence .

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN)Diplomats were left scrambling Tuesday as a truce between the government in Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists was falling apart. The U.N. Security Council unanimously voted, 15-0, to approve a resolution calling on all parties to abide by the ceasefire, which is proving to have more pull on paper than on the ground. Five more Ukrainian service members have been killed in the past 24 hours, Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Tuesday, the same day as the U.N. vote. Council members issued a statement expressing ""grave concern at the continued fighting in and around Debaltseve, Ukraine, which has resulted in numerous civilian casualties."" The members asked for detainees to be treated ""humanely."" ""We've gotten used to living in an upside down world with respect to Ukraine. Russia speaks of peace and then fuels conflict. Russia signs agreements and then does everything within its power to undermine them,"" Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told council members. ""We are caught in a deadly feedback loop. International leaders engage in rigorous exhaustive negotiations to get Russia to commit to peace ... yet Russia's commitments have no bearing on the actions of its soldiers and the separatists they back on the ground,"" she said. For its part, Russia continues to urge dialogue on political and constitutional issues. ""Since the very start of the crisis, Russia has actively called for a peaceful settlement,"" Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador, told council members. On Monday, Ukrainian Defense spokesman Andriy Lysenko reported five deaths from the previous day and at least 129 violations of the ceasefire since it went into effect at midnight Saturday. And there are more signs that the international efforts to stop the bloodshed are failing. Heavy clashes broke out Tuesday in Debaltseve, but both the Ukrainian military and pro-Russian separatists say they are not backing down. Debaltseve is a crucial city because it a strategic railroad hub in eastern Ukraine. The separatists have taken over 80% of Debaltseve, said Eduard Basurin, self-declared deputy defense minister of the rebel Donetsk People's Republic. He also said the separatists now have 60 Ukrainian prisoners of war. CNN cannot independently verify those claims. Lysenko said Ukrainian troops are holding their positions in Debaltseve in response to the rebels' attacks. A planned meeting between Ukrainian officials, pro-Russian separatists and European officials about the shaky ceasefire was canceled after one of the parties failed to show up, a European diplomat familiar with the talks told CNN. It is not clear what other reasons may have led to the cancellation. Members of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe were slated to participate in the meeting. On Tuesday, Russia and Ukraine reiterated their agreement to let OSCE monitors observe the ceasefire in Debaltseve. During a phone call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko agreed to ""concrete steps"" that would provide OSCE monitors access, German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said. Russia has denied widespread allegations it is supporting the pro-Russian separatists fighting in eastern Ukraine. Poroshenko has warned that if the separatists do not abide by the ceasefire, he will impose martial law throughout Ukraine's territory. In the beleaguered village of Shyrokyno, Ukrainian forces struggle to keep control of the territory. ""Right now, only about a third of the village is under our control,"" a machine gunner named Yury told CNN's Frederik Pleitgen. Separatists shelled Ukrainian forces with mortars, and both sides skirmished when rebels assaulted government troops with small arms and armored vehicles, said Dmytro Chalov, a spokesman for Ukraine's army in the Mariupol sector. Two Ukrainian security forces were wounded, he said. Oleg Shiryayev, commander of Ukraine's East Corpus battalion, said the ceasefire ""is a farce."" ""The fighting is continuing now the way it did before,"" Shiryayev told Pleitgen. ""They continue to attack us, shell us; they use artillery, mortars."" But it's impossible to tell which side is responsible for breaking the ceasefire in Shyrokyno. To some residents, it doesn't matter. ""The fighting is very heavy. All the windows (of) our house are broken,"" one woman said. ""It is very terrifying. We saved all our lives to buy our house, and now we have nothing."" CNN's Holly Yan wrote and reported from Atlanta, and CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported from Donetsk. CNN's Khushbu Shah, Claudia Rebaza, Richard Roth and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","""We are caught in a deadly feedback loop,"" says the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations .

"(CNN)Should he outlive his owners, Chunmun the monkey could be set to be one comfortable primate. An Indian couple who are estranged from their families say they've named Chunmun in their will as their only ""child,"" bequeathing to it their house in northern India's Uttar Pradesh state, other properties and all their money. Brijesh Srivastava, an owner of businesses including a flour mill and a cable network company, and his wife Shabista, a lawyer, are estranged from their families, who disapproved of their interfaith marriage years ago. Brijesh Srivastava is a Hindu; Shabista is a Muslim. They have no children. Shabista told CNN on Friday that bought Chunmun, then just a month old, from a roadside artist in 2005 after seeing the owner beat the animal with a stick. Though she and her husband have no children, Shabista said they take care of Chunmun like he's their son. She feeds the pet a diet of milk, dry nuts and fruits in the morning, and home-cooked food at night. ""He's like our child. We can't stay away from him,"" Shabista said. In 2010 they had Chunmun ""marry"" another monkey, Bitty, and gave the pets their own room with air conditioning. The couple's home is fitted with railings ""so he can freely move around the house,"" Shabista said. The couple didn't specify how much money could be coming Chunmun's way, other than to say they have millions of rupees in bank accounts. One million rupees equates to about $16,000. Besides bequeathing everything to Chunmun, the couple say they have started a fund that will raise money to rescue monkeys and build centers for their rehabilitation. ""People in India don't care about animals, but I feel they are just like humans. They need love and affection,"" Shabista said.","Brijesh and Shabista Srivastava say they've made pet monkey their heir in will .

"(CNN)Mars One, a group that plans to send humans on a one-way trip to Mars, has announced its final 100 candidates. They have been selected from 200,000 applicants and will go on to further testing later this year, which they expect to include team-building exercises and later, isolation. Eventually, 24 will be selected to make up six crews of four, which Mars One says they hope to launch to the Red Planet every two years from 2024, with the aim of starting a colony there. The Dutch non-profit hopes to use existing technology to carry out the mission. However, the planet has always been a difficult target for exploration, with only around half of all unmanned missions succeeding. The journey itself is expected to take around seven months, and a recent MIT study found that, should the first explorers succeed in landing, using current technology they would likely survive just 68 days. So what kind of person chooses to go to Mars on a one-way mission? The list of 100 finalists includes scientists and academics as well as those who are just seeking the ultimate adventure. We spoke to two of the British hopefuls. For Rigby, a chemistry graduate, who currently works as a secondary school lab technician, it is a lifelong passion for space that led to her decision to apply. ""I have always been interested in space; I grew up in the 80s watching shuttle launches, but always used to think that space travel was just for the Americans. When the opportunity came up I had to put my name forward."" But she admits that not everyone has been happy with her decision to apply, and the risks associated. ""Generally the reaction has been overwhelmingly positive from my friends and family since I told them I was down to the final 100, but it's going to be difficult for my mum. I haven't told her yet,"" she says. Rigby explains that when she first applied in 2013, her mum told her she didn't want her to go as she knew she would be selected and that she would never see her daughter again. ""I am very divided by it, but the way I see it, I have a responsibility to more people,"" Rigby says. She believes that the whole purpose of the mission is to inspire a new generation and that she has a responsibly to those who come after her. And she is unfazed by those who claim the whole idea is improbable: ""Pioneers are always ridiculed, but I am doing this for something better, which will hopefully benefit more people than just staying at home and keeping my mum happy."" Opinion: How will space explorers cope with isolation? It is this sense of responsibility and passion for the plans which drove Rigby through her selection process. Her initial video application included a speech she had rehearsed several times, talking about how Mars One is all about doing something for the greater good. She also had to take a standard medical examination and then a 15-minute interview, where Rigby was quizzed on past Mars missions and plans for Mars One. She succeeded in answering every question correctly. As for the risk -- ""of course I am scared,"" she says. ""It's something that has never been done before, it's a leap into the unknown. When people ask me why I am going to Mars to die, I say we are all going to die, but it's important what you do before you die."" ""I applied because it is the ultimate opportunity,"" explains Weedon, a 27-year-old manager who describes herself as somebody who doesn't want to lead the ordinary ""nine-to-five"" kind of life. ""I want to be able to go down in history,"" she says. ""I want to be able to say I made a difference to the future of mankind."" Weedon doesn't have a background in science, but says she is driven by the challenge. It's an aspiration shared by her family: Weedon's brother also applied but was not selected for the final 100. ""My brother is pretty jealous, but the rest of my friends and family are proud and excited."" The only exception is Weedon's boyfriend, who doesn't want her to go. Weedon thinks it was her teamworking skills which saw her through this far -- in her current job she works as part of a group of four, the same size as the planned Mars One crew. But she's not pretending a trip to Mars is going to be a walk in the park. ""When I think about it seriously I am petrified,"" she says, ""but that doesn't put me off, it drives me forward."" Though she admits she doesn't know if she is the right person for the job: ""Nobody can say 100% how they will react until training."" Like many who applied, the chance to join the small group of people who have left our planet is the biggest draw for Weedon. But there are still questions over whether the mission will even happen. As well as the MIT study raising doubts over the technology, Mars One must raise an estimated $6 billion, which it hopes to achieve through various methods, including crowdfunding, sponsorship and sales. But Weedon is optimistic. ""I definitely think it will happen, but in terms of the current roadmap, I just don't know whether it will happen on time,"" she says. ""A lot will depend on the unmanned missions planned for 2018."" Not daunted by the prospect of leaving behind friends and family, Weedon believes that the one-way trip is what needs to be done if we are ever to colonize Mars. ""Leaving will be a test of character, but we will still have contact through emails -- it's not game over.""

"(CNN)Get ready for the conspiracy theories if ""American Sniper"" doesn't snag the Academy Award for best picture on Sunday. Vanity Fair recently gathered a panel of movie experts in Hollywood to chat about the Oscars, and Fandango's Dave Karger offered a theory as to why the critically acclaimed film may not win. ""The reason why 'American Sniper' is not going to win is because of the plastic baby,"" Karger said, probably jokingly. The Clint Eastwood-directed film is based on the autobiography of  Chris Kyle, a Navy SEAL who had more documented kills than any other U.S. sniper since statistics have been gathered. Kyle was killed by an acquaintance in 2013. In the scene Karger refrenced, Chris and Taya Kyle (Bradley Cooper, who is up for the best actor Oscar, and Sienna Miller) are having a conversation in their new baby's room. The baby is pretty obviously not real. The film's screenwriter, Jason Hall, tweeted in December that ""real baby #1 showed up with a fever. Real baby #2 was no show. (Clint voice) Gimme the doll, kid."" That tweet has since been removed. The fake baby caused a social media stir and, of course, has its own Twitter account.","One critic joked that the film won't win an Oscar because of its fake baby .

"(CNN)If you have not been following the case of Barronelle Stutzman, you should be. Stutzman is the Washington florist who has been sued for living out her Christian beliefs. In 2013, a long-time friend and customer came to her flower shop and asked her to provide flowers for his gay wedding. Stutzman had known this man and had done business with him for about nine years. Nevertheless, she told him that she could not participate in his wedding ""because of my relationship with Jesus."" The man's partner subsequently spread the word via social media. As a result, the attorney general of Washington State sued Stutzman for violating the state's anti-discrimination law. The two men also sued her in their personal capacity and were represented by the ACLU. As a result of these lawsuits, Stutzman stands to lose her business, her home, and her personal savings. Her whole life hangs in the balance with this case. Yesterday, a Washington State judge issued a summary judgment that went against her. Stutzman's legal team put out this statement explaining what this means: . A state judge ruled Wednesday that Washington floral artist and grandmother Barronelle Stutzman must provide full support for wedding ceremonies that are contrary to her faith. The court also ruled recently that both the state and the same-sex couple, who each filed lawsuits against her, may collect damages and attorneys fees not only from her business, but from Stutzman personally. That means the 70-year-old grandmother may not only lose her business, but also her home and savings because she lives her life and operates her business according to her beliefs. ""The message of these rulings is unmistakable: The government will bring about your personal and professional ruin if you don't help celebrate same-sex marriage,"" said Kristen Waggoner, senior counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom, who argued before the court in December. The decision against Stutzman sets a dreadful precedent against our first freedom in the Bill of Rights: religious liberty. The court says that she is free to believe what she wants, but not to practice her religious beliefs. The court has ruled that if she wants to run a business in the state of Washington, she must defy her conscience and participate in same-sex weddings. If she does not, then the full coercive power of the state -- as well as civil liability -- will be brought against her. Keep in mind that Stutzman does not refuse service to gay people. Indeed she had been selling flowers to this gay couple for nine years. She has also employed gay people in her flower shop. She had a friendship with the man suing her and cared for him personally and wished for her relationship with him to continue. She simply could not defy her conscience and lend her creative talent to help celebrate what her faith says she cannot celebrate. She had no idea that staying true to her faith would end up threatening her entire livelihood and savings. We are witnessing a shift in our society -- a shift which inevitably leads to Christians being treated as pariahs at every level of our national life. Louie Giglio's Christian views on marriage got him removed from the President's inauguration. Brendan Eich's support for traditional marriage got him dismissed as CEO of Mozilla. Kelvin Cochran's Christian faith got him fired from his position as fire chief of Atlanta. Two bakers in Oregon had to shutter their business and are now facing bankruptcy for refusing to participate in a gay wedding. The stories are mounting. Who will be next? This summer, the Supreme Court will rule on gay marriage, and many observers expect the ruling to be a Roe v. Wade-type legal landmark, perhaps declaring a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. The Congress may consider again a version of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would make sexual orientation and gender identity into protected classes. This means that what is happening to Barronelle Stutzman in Washington State could be happening to Christians nationwide in very short order. Barronelle Stutzman's case is nothing less than an egregious violation of our first freedom. It is Caesar saying, ""Conscience be damned. Submit to the new sexual orthodoxy or risk losing everything."" This is not tolerance. This is  injustice that flies in the face of this nation's laws and traditions. And if this kind of thing can be done to a 70-year-old grandmother running a small flower shop in rural Washington State, then it can be done to you. No one's conscience is safe if this precedent becomes the norm.","Barronelle Stutzman was sued for not providing flowers for a same-sex wedding.

"(CNN)The photo shows a young man, his hair short and his eyes looking at the ground as he walks out of a car. The only thing he's wearing above the waist is a necklace -- unless you count his tattoos and the handcuffs behind his back. This is Erich Nowsch. Most of America first saw his face and learned his name Thursday, when Las Vegas police announced the 19-year-old's arrest in connection to what they called a road rage incident February 12 that ended with a mother of four mortally wounded by a gunshot. But at least for a brief period two years ago, Nowsch seemingly had no qualms about putting himself out there on social media. The profile photo on what appears to be his Facebook page, last updated in January 2013, shows him with his tongue wagging, his hand tattooed, with a ballcap on his head and thick chain around his neck. He's holding what appears to be a wad of cash, including at least one $100 bill. Nowsch's apparent Intagram profile is from around the same time; the last posts were in March 2013. It has a clear theme, though, with the majority of pictures showing marijuana in its various forms and some of the teenager seemingly smoking it. The header for that page? Moblife18. It's not clear how any of his past led to Nowsch's arrest Thursday, one week after his neighbor Tammy Meyers was shot. It could have nothing to do with it; authorities have not pinpointed a motive or state of mind in the alleged road rage incident and shooting, or during Nowsch's later short-lived standoff with police. Still, Meyers' husband, Robert, said that he and others knew about Nowsch before this happened, and what they knew wasn't good. ""We knew how bad he was,"" Robert Meyers told reporters. ""But we didn't know it was this bad."" Erich Nowsch spent Friday in the Clark County Detention Center on charges of murder, attempted murder and discharging a gun from a vehicle in a prohibited area. He's set to have his first day in court on Monday. It was unclear Thursday night whether Nowsch had an attorney; court documents detailing his charges didn't list a lawyer. And his distraught mother wasn't talking, turning away reporters. Police are looking for another suspect. But they believe it was Nowsch who shot Tammy Meyers soon after she'd gotten out of her car outside her Las Vegas home, about a block from his own home. Twists, turns in deadly Las Vegas case . Authorities believe the shooting stemmed from an earlier encounter with a man who they say drove sped past her as she was returning home after giving her 15-year-old daughter a driving lesson. The daughter honked the horn, prompting the car to stop. A man got out of the car and confronted them. Robert Meyers told HLN's Nancy Grace that the man threatened to kill his wife and daughter. Tammy Meyers returned home, dropped off her daughter and picked up her 22-year-old son, who was armed. The mother and son then drove away and tracked down a man thought to be Nowsch, only to lose sight of him. Soon after, a car showed up in the Meyers' cul-de-sac. The family has said there were three people in the car. Gunfire broke out. The son told police that he and his mother were fired upon, and he shot back. Tammy Meyers was shot once in the head. She died two days later, on Valentine's Day. She was 44 years old. That was the extent of what authorities knew about the back-and-forth between Nowsch and Tammy Meyers until Thursday, according to Las Vegas police Capt. Chris Tomaino. It was then that Robert Meyers first told reporters that Nowsch and his wife had known each other for some time. His wife had spent ""countless hours at the park consoling this boy,"" he said. ""She was really good to him. She fed him, she gave him money. ""She told him to pull his pants up and to be a man,"" Robert Meyers added. ""More times than I can count.""

"Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri exhorted his fighters to find out who killed his chief representative in war-torn Syria, where militants have had a strong presence and strong rivalries amid the country's civil war. Two suicide bombers in Aleppo killed Khaled al-Suri in February when they blew themselves up inside a compound used as a headquarters. Al-Zawahiri, in a recorded message posted on a militant website and uploaded on YouTube, deplored the action and called it ""sedition."" ""All Muslims should not help those who blow up the headquarters of the holy fighters or those who send them car bombs and human bombs, and to stop supporting it in any way,"" the speaker said. CNN could not independently confirm that al-Zawahiri made the remarks. But his comments in the past have shown up on the same militant website. Syria, now in its fourth year of civil warfare, has been the site of what many have called a deadly proxy war between Shiite and Sunni militants. Iran has backed Bashar al-Assad's government in Syria, and Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite group, has fought in support of the government. Sunni governments, such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia, have supported rebels. Islamic militants, such as al Qaeda-linked groups, have taken up arms in the country. Rivalry and fighting have emerged between extremist groups in Syria, such al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. As a result, al-Zawahiri urged all Muslims and mujahedeen to refrain from infighting. ""Whoever commits such sins should remember that he is fulfilling for the enemies of Islam what they were unable to achieve on their own with all their resources,"" al-Zawahiri said. Well over 100,000 people have been killed and millions displaced in the civil war, the United Nations says.

Bacani has no formal training in photography but her black and white street scenes have captured the imagination of thousands through social media. ""For her to get this fellowship will literally change her life -- not just her photography, but also her life. She may be able to leave domestic work for good,"" says Sim Chi Yin, a Beijing-based documentary photographer and 2010 Magnum Fellow. ""She is uniquely placed to tell the story of her community, that of migrant workers,"" says Sim, who recommended Bacani for the fellowship. Bacani's first documentary project captured the stories of a group of women at Bethune House Migrant Women's Refuge, a shelter for abused migrant workers. At the shelter, the lines between Bacani and her subjects were blurred: Bacani's own status as a migrant worker helped her befriend the women and tell their stories through a series of honest portraits. When it was time to submit her application for the Magnum Foundation scholarship, Bacani turned to the women at Bethune to help her select and curate a set of photos. Bacani is one of more than 320,000 foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong. Her alarm goes off at 5:30 a.m. most mornings. She serves her boss breakfast, cleans the apartment and takes care of six grandchildren when they visit after school. On her one day off each week, Bacani wanders the streets of Hong Kong with her camera in hand, ready to photograph. She feels bittersweet about leaving her job as a domestic worker. ""My work as a domestic is a safe haven,"" she wrote. ""At the end of the month, I feel secure that I can send my father money for his medicine or help my siblings."" Yet she believes the Magnum Fellowship will push her to do her best work. She is looking forward learning under the mentorship of documentary photographer Susan Meiselas, and meeting the other fellows from Ukraine, Haiti, Syria, China, South Africa and the Palestinian territories. After the six week course at NYU, Bacani hopes to find another fellowship that will allow her to extend her stay in New York and continue her goal of becoming a photojournalist. ""She definitely has a very strong eye,"" says Sim. ""Even those working as photographers don't have the discipline to take photos daily. She puts some of us to shame, honestly. Even the snaps she takes on a daily basis are pretty magical.""","Filipino maid Xyza Cruz Bacani has won a photography fellowship in New York .

"Washington (CNN)Rudy wouldn't be Rudy if he backed down. But by amplifying his charge that President Barack Obama doesn't love America, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani appears ready to risk sullying the powerful mythology that grew around his leadership when he steadied and steeled the nation in the terrible, confusing time after 9/11. Since those fleeting days when he was a unifying figure, Giuliani has more often dealt in waspish rhetoric and savage mockery -- especially of a president he says has ""failed."" ""America's Mayor"" has gone rogue, lashing out at Democrats and liberal orthodoxy on the war on terror and saying, for example, during the Ferguson controversy last year that the biggest danger to a black child was not from a white police officer but from another African American. The latest firestorm over Obama's patriotism may complete Giuliani's political journey from the center left of the Republican Party to the conservative jungles where Sarah Palin and Donald Trump roam. ""Rudy has devolved into this red meat Republican base ideologue who periodically seems to need self identification,"" said Douglas Muzzio, a political scientist at Baruch College and a New York City media commentator. ""Maybe it is Rudy in his dotage, where he has lost whatever boundaries he once had. He sounds like a bitter old man."" Giuliani seems to be relishing his moment back in the spotlight. But he's also causing awkward moments for Republican candidates limbering up for a crack at the presidency in 2016 -- a fact the White House was quick to exploit on Friday. ""It's sad to see when somebody who has attained a certain level of public stature, and even admiration, tarnishes that legacy so thoroughly,"" said Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest. ""And the truth is, I don't take any joy, or vindication, or satisfaction from that. I think, really, the only thing that I feel is I feel sorry for Rudy Giuliani today."" Democratic National Committee Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz also joined in, seeking to use Giuliani to frustrate the GOP's effort to short circuit controversies which could tarnish the party's image. ""Now is the time for its leaders to stop this kind of nonsense. Enough,"" she said. Giuliani's blast, delivered in a closed door Republican dinner, and repeated in a media tour, centers on a claim that Obama was not brought up to ""love"" his country like most Americans. It's a familiar charge from the conservative fringe, that Obama is somehow different and doesn't view America as an exceptional paragon but is obsessed with apologizing for its failings. ""I do not believe, and I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe the president loves America,"" Giuliani was quoted as saying by Politico. Asked by Fox News host Megyn Kelly Thursday whether he wanted to apologize,  Giuliani replied: ""Not at all. I want to repeat it."" ""I don't feel this love of America,"" Giuliani said. ""I believe his initial approach is to criticize the United States."" Giuliani dug in further in an interview with the New York Times, rejecting the idea that his remarks were born of racism. ""I thought that was a joke, since (Obama) was brought up by a white mother, a white grandfather, went to white schools, "" said Giuliani. ""This isn't racism. This is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism,"" said Giuliani. Far from being chastened, Giuliani, who wore a conspiratorial grin on Fox News,  seems gleeful in the firestorm. His behavior might be explained by a boxing maxim he was taught as a boy, which may also shed light on his calmness on 9/11. ""My father taught me ... when you get hit in the face for the first time, you're going to panic,"" Giuliani said in an interview with Forbes magazine in 2011. ""Instead of panicking, just accept it. Stay calm. And any time anybody hits you, they always leave themselves open to be hit."" Giuliani's actions may be both a glimpse at his political philosophy and reflect a decision to wade into the political echo chamber to solidify his standing among a certain group of conservatives. ""He understands political posturing, he understands the effectiveness of rhetoric,"" said Errol Louis, a CNN political commentator from New York. ""He clearly wants to play a role on the national stage. I guess he has chosen the role of bulldog -- go after the president, attack him, make wild accusations."" With a failed presidential campaign behind him, and having been out of office for a decade-and-a-half, it may be that Giuliani sees his future on the conservative talk circuit. ""To the extent that Giuliani will be involved in the game moving forward, it will be as a commentator or an analyst,"" said Costas Panagopoulos, a campaigns expert at Fordham University, New York. ""In order to do that successfully these days, it helps to be controversial, sometimes inflammatory. I am not surprised that he has become increasingly forceful in his comments in the media. He is convinced that will help him."" Giuliani has rarely been known to back down. He was a Yankee fan growing up in Brooklyn, a ruthless prosecutor who took on unions and the Mob and a hard driving Republican who ran a liberal city. When he awoke on September 11, 2001, Giuliani was a polarizing figure with a large ego and a sharp tongue. He might have purged New York street crime but was starting to grate on the city's nerves at the end of his second term. Within hours, with a staggering display of calm, purpose and leadership, he had recast himself as a modern-era Winston Churchill, steadying and inspiring his people in their darkest hour. His heroics were such that he became one of those politicians who become known by a single name. Marching up Broadway, he grabbed a mike and told people to evacuate southern Manhattan. He conjured up national resolve and resistance, as a country waited hours to see its president, out of sight on Air Force One. ""People tonight should say a prayer, for the people that we have lost, and be grateful that we are all here,"" he said in a late night press conference 12 hours after the Twin Towers came crashing down in a toxic cloud of fire and ash. ""Tomorrow New York is going to be here and we are going to rebuild and we are going to be stronger from before."" Making Giuliani its Man of the Year, Time Magazine said: ""When the day of infamy came, Giuliani seized it as if he had been waiting for it all his life."" But he struggled to meet huge expectations. His 2008 presidential campaign was a bust, plagued by poor organization and his liberal views on social issues that conflicted with the conservative base. But there was also a sense that he was playing the September 11 card too much: Joe Biden's crack that there were ""only three things he mentions in a sentence, a noun a verb and 9/11"" was funny because it bore more than a ring of truth. That was years ago now. But while his years of elective office are behind him, Giuliani still seems to pine for the political spotlight. So he has every incentive to keep this row going as long as he can.","Giuliani defiant about Obama comments .

"ASUNCION, Paraguay (CNN) -- Mexico and Paraguay are the top two marijuana-producing countries in the world, a U.N. report says. Mexico is the top marijuana producer, a U.N. report says. Here, a member of Mexico's army guards a drug seizure. While reports of the war on drugs in Mexico are common and well-documented, the fact that tiny, landlocked Paraguay is No. 2 in the world may surprise some. But most countries in South America, notably Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile, cite Paraguay as the main source for the marijuana on their market, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. And two of those countries -- Brazil and Argentina -- report an increase in marijuana use due to the ready availability of the crop coming from Paraguay. The reason marijuana is so abundant in Paraguay is simple, authorities there say: economics. ""Our reality is that we have large crops, large parcels of crops,"" said Cesar Aquino, the head of Paraguay's antidrug agency. ""They don't dedicate themselves to cultivating marijuana because they are narcotraffickers, but because of economic necessity. Compared to the price of a traditional crop, they can make 500 percent more with this."" The U.N. report says marijuana cultivation remains concentrated in North America, where the largest producers are Mexico and the United States. Worldwide production for 2006, the latest year for which figures are available, was around 41,400 metric tons, said the U.N.'s World Drug Report 2008. A metric ton equals 2,205 pounds. Mexico produced 7,400 metric tons, while the United States cultivated 4,700 metric tons, the U.N. report said. In South America, Paraguay ( 5,900 metric tons) easily outproduced Colombia, Brazil, the Caribbean region (notably St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Jamaica) and Central America (notably Guatemala), the World Drug Report said. In Africa, where marijuana production takes place in nearly every country, the largest producer is South Africa (2,500 metric tons), followed by Malawi, Zambia and Swaziland. In addition, the report says, Nigeria, Ghana and several other West African countries (Guinea, Ivory Coast, Benin and Togo) cultivate relatively large amounts, as do the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Egypt and Morocco. Paraguay produces more than half of the 10,000 metric tons marijuana grown in all of South America, the United Nations says. Most of the growers are poor, and they cultivate their crops on nature preserves and private forests near where they live. While arrests for trafficking and selling drugs are common, Paraguayan authorities say, there is not a single person in jail for growing and cultivating marijuana. Authorities say it's too hard to catch growers. ""The size of an eradication operation involves moving many people and resources,"" said Oscar Chamorro, a commander in Paraguay's special forces. ""That gives [growers] the advantage insofar as detection of our forces coming into an area. Normally, we go in, and they have abandoned the area."" In addition, each eradication raid costs around $25,000, officials say. As a result, the government is asking for help from countries that may be affected by marijuana coming from Paraguay. Specialists say that marijuana grown in Paraguay is in great demand because of its high potency. In addition, the experts say, Paraguayan soil is excellent for growing marijuana and can yield 6,600 pounds for each hectare (2.47 acres). Many plots can yield more than one harvest a year. Other facts from the U.N. report released in June: . Journalist Sanie Lopez Garelli in Paraguay and CNN's Arthur Brice contributed to this report.","Most South American nations cite Paraguay as top source for marijuana, U.N. says .

"(CNN)For the second year in a row Hollywood's leading women let fly a clarion call, setting the industry to rights. Following Cate Blanchett's remarks last year, in which the Best Actress winner excoriated the industry for its focus of male-centric filmmaking, Best Supporting Actress winner Patricia Arquette rounded on America's attitude to gender inequality. Reading from a prepared speech Arquette dedicated her award to ""every woman who gave birth, to every taxpayer and citizen of this nation. We have fought for everybody else's equal rights, it's our time to have wage equality once and for all, and equal rights for women in the United States of America."" The actress' comments received a rousing response; three-time Oscar winner Meryl Streep burst into enthusiastic applause alongside Jennifer Lopez, whilst Arquette's 'Boyhood' co-star Ethan Hawke and director Richard Linklaker looked on with a mixture of pride and surprise. Social media immediately rallied behind Arquette's call. Model Cara Delevingne took to Instagram while 'Girls' creator Lena Dunham and documentary maker Michael Moore turned to Twitter. It was a night in which inequality was in tight focus. Host Neil Patrick Harris poked fun at the lack of diversity among the nominations, whilst rapper Common and R&B star John Legend brought tears to the eyes of audience members with their rendition of 'Selma's civil rights inspired song 'Glory'. But with much of the pre-ceremony disquiet focused on the lack of racial diversity, few expected women's inequality would be brought to the fore. Wage inequality is still prevalent in America. Women earn 77 cents for every dollar men earn, the nation ranking 65th globally in a report last autumn by the World Economic Forum. Last year the top ten earning actors made a combined $419 million, whilst the top ten earning actresses only managed $226 million. Arquette's comments come after reports repeatedly confirm that women in Hollywood are being underpaid and underrepresented compared to their male counterparts. A 2014 study from the Journal of Management Inquiry found Hollywood's women commanded their highest wages at the average age of 34, before rapidly declining. Meanwhile men peak at the considerably older age of 51, remaining stable thereafter. It speaks to Hollywood's obsession with women aging that much of the praise Arquette received for 'Boyhood' revolved around her choice to age naturally on screen across the film's long gestation period, from her peak of 33 through to 46. At age 65, Streep has rebuffed the terminal decline Hollywood imposes on many actresses' careers, but the pedestal the industry places her upon testifies to how rare a case she is. A recent report from the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film has recorded a dearth of female-driven features, with actresses making up only 12% of protagonists in 2014's top-grossing films. This was despite such films earning a large share of total box office -- spearheaded by Jennifer Lawrence, 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1' was the top-grossing film in the U.S. last year with $334 million. But such leading parts are few and far between. In fact, data suggests the number of female starring roles is decreasing, falling 3% since 2013 and down 4% on 2002. Author of the study, Dr Martha Lauzen, told Variety that  ""there is a growing disconnect or gap between what we might perceive as being the current status of women in film and their actual status... A few high-profile cases can skew our thinking."" Lead actresses are even missing out in films directed by women. Last year female protagonists starred in only 39% of such films, whilst those directed by men registered at a meager 4%. Among the 57 films nominated at this year's Oscars, 15 had out-and-out female leads -- that being, a film told from the lead actress' perspective. Representing 26% of the total nominees, this percentage is far higher than Hollywood's output last year. However, among those 15 films there were 11 foreign films, shorts, animations and documentaries, demonstrating how leading actresses are often left on the periphery when it comes to major Hollywood features. There were no female-driven stories among the eight films vying for Best Picture; so too in both adapted and original screenplay categories. Speaking of the lack of female-driven films, Dr Lauzen pointed the finger of blame at those off-screen. ""We need to have greater diversity behind the scenes if this is going to change.""

"(CNN)A caretaker for baseball legend Ernie Banks coerced him into signing a new will before his death, leaving all his assets to her, the Hall of Famer's family says. The renowned Chicago Cub died of a heart attack last month at age 83. His death certificate cites dementia as a significant contributing factor to his death, CNN affiliate WGN reported. Banks family attorney Mark Bogen said Banks' agent, Regina Rice, had the octogenarian sign a new will three months before his death. ""Our family thought that Ms. Rice was helping our father and watching over him while he was in Chicago,"" son Joey Banks said in a statement from the attorney. ""However, we have learned that she had him sign a power of attorney, a health care directive and a will giving everything to Ms. Rice."" Another son, Jerry Banks, said he believes Rice coerced his father when he was ill. He said that before his father's sudden death, ""we spoke often to Ms. Rice because she made it difficult for us to speak directly to him. ""However, she purposefully never told us that while our father was ill, he signed documents giving her total control,"" Jerry Banks said. Bogan said the family didn't know of the new will until after Banks' funeral. ""We will vigorously fight and contest this will,"" the family attorney said. Rice issued her own statement, saying she was carrying out Banks' wishes. ""Ernie was an intricate part of my life for over twelve (12) years. Ernie trusted me to carry out his wishes, some during his lifetime and others after his life. He made me promise to adhere to his wishes and I am determined to do just that,"" Rice said. ""It is understandable that Ernie's family is concerned at this very sad time. However, the record and those closest to Ernie will dispel any iota of concern regarding my relationship with Ernie and his trust in me to carrying out his wishes,"" she said. ""I will not participate in any verbal jousting with Ernie's family or do anything to bring negativity to the legacy of such a dear and honorable and extremely positive man. Ernie would have hated that."" Banks started his career in the Negro Leagues, making $7 a day. He later joined the big leagues and became ""one of the greatest players of all time,"" Cubs Chairman Tom Ricketts said. ""Words cannot express how important Ernie Banks will always be to the Chicago Cubs, the city of Chicago and Major League Baseball,"" Ricketts said after Banks' death. ""He was a pioneer in the major leagues. And more importantly, he was the warmest and most sincere person I've ever known."" Six years after his last at-bat, Banks was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977.

"He might be one of Egypt's most recognizable faces but in Cairo's Tahrir Square last January, when it became the focal point for anti-regime sentiment, actor Khaled Abol Naga was proud to be just one of the crowd. The award-winning film star and activist, described by many fans as the ""Egyptian Brad Pitt,"" was among the disgruntled Egyptians who filled the square last year when the daily gatherings of thousands of protesters ultimately led to the removal of longtime President Hosni Mubarak. ""I've never been more proud in my life than being one -- not even a leader or a recognized face -- being one of millions who walked and protested in the 18 days,"" remembers Naga. ""Next to me a CEO from a bank, on the other side a porter who doesn't know even how to read, men, women, Copts, Muslims, educated, uneducated, old, young,"" he adds. Naga says that this sense of equality gave Egyptians the bonding and unity they had longed for. ""There was a sense of a new spirit that came to Egyptians and they felt we are all equal and we are all fighting for the same rights. And there's something so good about that, that Egyptians felt so proud of,"" says Naga. Tunisian star says artists finally free after uprising . Passionate about his country and his people, Naga says Egyptians are very proud of their African roots and adds that there are many lessons that African countries can learn from the Egypt revolution. He says: ""The power of the people is always stronger than the people in power. In Africa it's time that the people now are realizing that all those dictatorships, all these iron-fist governments, are not helping anybody; definitely not the people of these countries but definitely not the continent as a whole. ""We are very rich -- this is one of the richest resources areas in the world, and very underdeveloped. So it's about time that people really start having the power and to really change this situation and make use for the benefit of its own people. ""So I think it's enough isolation and it's time to unite."" One of Egypt's most popular stars, Naga has carved out a distinctive acting career, winning several awards, including Best Actor for ""Leabet El Hob"" at the 2006 Alexandria International Film Festival. More recently, he co-produced and starred in the critically acclaimed ""Microphone,"" a movie examining Egypt's underground art and music scenes. 'Egypt's elections can't be trusted' The film, which has picked up numerous awards this year, is the latest vehicle for Naga, who has a long history of putting the spotlight on key issues affecting youth in his country and beyond. Since 2007, Naga has been a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, championing causes as such as HIV awareness, and highlighting issues such as female genital mutilation and the treatment of street children. ""My interest was always to stand by the youth, youth empowerment,"" he says. ""It's an untapped treasure, the youth of Africa, not only the Arab world, because there is a lot of young people there. We need to empower them, protect them, educate them, so that we really have the real development going on. ""If I talk about any issue I end up finding that the solution would be in the hands of the young people. So, also, you're talking to the future -- when you are talking to the youth you are talking to the future. And that's why I always wanted to, I found myself doing these projects, awareness projects, with young people."" It is this sense of wanting to be involved that has defined Naga's desire to make a difference. Not afraid of voicing his ideas and opinions, he regularly uses his blog to comment on social issues and politics. He says the process helps him become better at his craft. ""If I'm honest enough and expressing my opinions about things socially, politically, I feel better about myself and I feel that I can actually be a better artist,"" says Naga.","Khaled Abol Naga is one of Egypt's most prominent film stars .

"(CNN) -- The medical journal that published a now-retracted paper linking childhood vaccines to autism conducted only a cursory investigation into complaints about the research when they emerged, another British journal reported Tuesday. The author of the 1998 paper, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, and his co-authors reaffirmed their findings after complaints about Wakefield's research surfaced in 2004. However, the medical journal BMJ reported Tuesday, the examination into how the study was conducted was led by the editor of the Lancet, which published the paper, and involved ""no formal investigation"" of the allegations. ""In short, the accused were investigating themselves,"" the BMJ reported. Tuesday's article is the third and last of a series published by BMJ, which has called Wakefield's study an ""elaborate fraud"" and accused him of planning to launch a business venture ""off the back of the vaccine scare."" Following a three-year investigation, Britain's General Medical Council ruled in January 2010 that the way Wakefield conducted his research was dishonest and irresponsible. One month later, the Lancet retracted the study. In May 2010, British authorities revoked Wakefield's license to practice medicine. Wakefield continues to insist he has done nothing wrong, and a vocal contingent of advocates for children with autism continues to support him. In response to the latest article, the Lancet's editors said they ""strongly disagree"" with the BMJ account ""and firmly stand by our actions and decisions."" It noted that 10 of Wakefield's co-authors had their names removed from the paper after learning in 2004 that Wakefield had been paid by lawyers to help build a case against vaccine manufacturers -- a serious conflict of interest he failed to disclose -- and pointed out that Wakefield's most damning assertion was made at a separate news conference after the study was published, not in the paper that the journal published. ""From this point forward, Wakefield encouraged the media and a grassroots network of anti-vaccine advocates to believe that this vaccine may cause autism,"" the Lancet said. It added, ""At no point did we actively defend Wakefield's public statements about the link between MMR and autism."" The journal said the Royal Free Hospital, where Wakefield worked at the time of the publication, conducted the 2004 investigation that led to a partial retraction by the paper's co-authors. ""At each stage we acted as soon as we had the evidence to do so,"" it said. Wakefield has accused the author of the BMJ report, freelance journalist Brian Deer, of being paid by the pharmaceutical industry. In financial disclosure forms, Deer has stated that he has received no such payments. The now-discredited paper panicked many parents and led to a sharp drop in the number of children getting the vaccine that prevents measles, mumps and rubella. Vaccination rates dropped sharply in Britain after its publication, falling as low as 80% by 2004. Measles cases have gone up sharply in the ensuing years. In the United States, more cases of measles were reported in 2008 than in any other year since 1997, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 90% of those infected had not been vaccinated or their vaccination status was unknown, the CDC reported.

"Iraq is tearing itself apart. Its government has lost control of large parts of the country; intercommunal violence is rife and al Qaeda is resurgent. A description not of 2014 but 2006 -- and a situation that led Joseph R. Biden, then a U.S. Senator and now Vice President, to argue that it was time to split Iraq into three parts: Kurdish, Shia and Sunni. Biden and Leslie Gelb, in an op-ed for the New York Times, looked to Bosnia as the modern precedent, which they asserted had been preserved by ""paradoxically, dividing it into ethnic federations, even allowing Muslims, Croats and Serbs to retain separate armies."" It was a formula, they believed, that could work in Iraq. ""The Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws, administration and internal security. The central government would control border defense, foreign affairs and oil revenues."" So ran the argument. The Biden/Gelb plan was endorsed by the U.S. Senate in 2007 but ignored by the Bush Administration. Seven years later, the division of Iraq into ethnic regions looks more likely than ever. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) holds much of western and northern Iraq, including the city of Mosul, and the Kurdish leadership is pressing ahead with plans for a referendum as a likely step towards a unilateral declaration of independence. Ramzy Mardini, an Iraq expert at the Atlantic Council, says: ""The basic equation is this: ISIS provokes Shiites, Shiites overreact and generalize their response against Sunnis, and more Sunnis come to support ISIS. It's a vicious circle, with each cycle hardening the sectarian divide."" For that reason, the chances of a negotiated separation have evaporated. ""Biden often saw Iraq through the lens of the former Yugoslavia, [but] borders can't come from pencil and paper,"" Mardini told CNN. ""It would have to come out of ethnic war."" ""Iraq is a state that has always been governed under authoritarian rule. Assuming it can suddenly pivot to a federal, democratic system is naive, not only about the history of Iraq, but about the political system of federalism in general. Federalism is a complicated and sophisticated framework."" Taking aim at ISIS: Women train with AK-47s to defend streets . Among the many obstacles to a negotiated break-up, Sunni areas in the west would not be economically viable unless they received a share of oil revenues from other regions; theirs is the only part of Iraq not sitting on lakes of oil. There are also few natural borders, and plenty of areas -- especially Baghdad and Diyala province -- where the different communities live cheek by jowl. Sunnis would not agree to Kurdish rule of the mixed city of Kirkuk. ""For a decade now, they have been unable to pass a revenue-sharing and oil law,"" Mardini says. ""How will you get Shiite Iraq to share their revenues with Sunni Iraq? And how do you get the Iraqis to agree on the borders of the regions? That would require political settlements on all disputed territories - and we know how hard it has been to do that for the last decade."" The orphans of Iraq . A redrawing of the map, whether at a conference or through conflict, would have a huge impact on the region. Turkey, Iran and Syria -- all of which have their own Kurdish minorities -- would be wary of an oil-rich Kurdish state on their borders. The Shiite part of Iraq would most likely become closely integrated with Iran, giving Tehran much more leverage over Iraq's oil industry. ""The unity of Iraq has been a major core interest for the United States for a reason,"" Mardini says. ""Without the Sunnis and Kurds as a part of Iraq, then there's not much to help balance out the influence Iran has in the country's national oil politics."" On the other hand, an independent Sunni region -- one that no longer felt discriminated against by a majority Shia government -- might be saved from falling into extremist hands. The Sunnis would have no incentive to turn to a jihadist group like ISIS as an ally if they had no enemy in Baghdad. Equally, they might make common cause with Syria's Sunnis. Many of the tribes live both sides of the border. The collapse of Iraq raises the specter of mass migration and violence of the sort that accompanied the birth of India and Pakistan. It is a real danger, but the current situation has already driven thousands of people from their homes; hundreds more have been killed. Some historians argue that Iraq was never really a country anyway, more a colonial confection like British India, and we are now seeing the inevitable consequence. How Iran is pushing U.S. aside in Iraq . The Rest Is History . In the early 20th century, tribes were paramount in the vast Arabian deserts. The arbitrary carve-up of Arabia began with the Sykes Picot agreement in 1916, with the French taking the mandate to govern Syria and Lebanon, and the British what was then Palestine and Iraq. In 1919 the League of Nations rubber-stamped French and British administration of vast areas of what had been the Ottoman Empire. Iraq's borders were created at a conference in Cairo in 1921, largely thanks to Winston Churchill and T E Lawrence (aka Lawrence of Arabia), who were among about 40 British officials gathered at the Semiramis Palace on the Nile. They effectively invented Iraq, setting up Faisal bin Hussein as the king of a new country. Faisal was a Sunni and a Hashemite who wasn't even from Iraq. British policy was to promote the interests of the Sunni and other minorities as a counter-balance to the Shia majority -- and expel troublesome Shia clergy, all tools that Saddam Hussein would find useful a half-century later. Against the advice of several experts, the new Iraq included the Kurdish-dominated province of Mosul, as a buffer against both Turkey and Russia (soon to become the Soviet Union.) One of the senior advisers at the Cairo Conference was Gertrude Bell, an indomitable traveler who knew many of the region's tribal sheikhs.

"To those who study or even practiced espionage, U.S. spying on allies is hardly new. Friendly nations spy on one another, if only for this reality: a friend today may not be a friend tomorrow, experts say. ""Even among friends, a lot of espionage takes place, and some of that espionage is targeted against threats to national security,"" said Charles Kupchan, international affairs professor at Georgetown University and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""Then there is more mundane day-to-day intelligence gathering, which is focusing on intelligence that would be relevant to American statecraft: who is likely to be the next foreign minister, what's Germany's position on negotiations with Iran?"" Kupchan said. The mutual spying is ""common knowledge"" among practitioners and scholars, sometimes confirmed years later with a disclosure, Kupchan said. ""It's been going on for centuries,"" he said. Embassies can be an arm of such espionage. Countries allow the missions to exchange information formally but they're used to gather intelligence covertly, too, said Peter Earnest, who worked for the CIA for 36 years, including about 25 years in the agency's clandestine service. ""I think there's a degree of hypocrisy among the Europeans to say, 'Oh, my gosh, the Americans are spying!' Well, so are they,"" said Earnest, the founding executive director of the International Spy Museum in Washington. EU delegation meeting at White House over NSA spying concerns . The former spy was referring to the uproar across Europe in the wake of news accounts that the U.S. National Security Administration has been spying on the continent: on German Chancellor Angela Merkel's official cellphone; on millions of France's phone calls; and on millions of Spain's phone calls and its politicians and officials. The NSA also has eavesdropped on the Mexican government and hacked the public e-mail account of former President Felipe Calderon and his presidency's e-mail domain that also was used by Cabinet members, according to German news magazine Der Spiegel. Most of the news accounts are relying on documents provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Glaring spotlight on intelligence committee . ""It's the leak that keeps on giving on damage,"" Earnest said. ""I'm glad I'm not in the community right now. It must be a nightmare."" He retired from the Central Intelligence Agency in 1994. In describing the espionage among friends, Earnest referred to a famous quote by 19th century British statesman Henry Temple, or Lord Palmerston, who stated in Parliament: ""We have no eternal allies and we have no perpetual enemies. Our interests are eternal and perpetual, and those interests it is our duty to follow."" Before Congress on Tuesday, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper acknowledged as a ""fundamental given"" that the United States gathers intelligence on foreign leaders. When asked by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers whether U.S. allies spy against U.S. leaders, Clapper replied: ""Absolutely."" ""We do not spy on anyone except for valid foreign intelligence purposes and we only work within the law. Now, to be sure, on occasion, we've made mistakes -- some quite significant,"" Clapper told the House committee reviewing the agency's surveillance activities. Clapper has worked in intelligence services for 50 years. In other testimony to the committee, Army Gen. Keith Alexander, director of the NSA, said media outlets misinterpreted the leaked documents. Some of the metadata on phones calls in ally countries came from those countries, and the remaining metadata was collected legally by the NSA, he said. NSA chief: Reports U.S. collected calls, e-mails from allies 'completely false' Historians readily cite instances of U.S. spying on allies, including bugging of conversations in San Francisco, where the United Nations charter was drawn up in 1945, said David Barrett, a political science professor at Villanova University who has written about U.S. intelligence history. ""I have to say I'm not very surprised,"" Barrett said of U.S. surveillance on friends. 'Horrified by what they had learned' During the Cold War in 1960, two NSA employees, William Martin and Bernon Mitchell, defected to the Soviet Union and publicly revealed how the United States was spying on not just rivals, but allies, too. The NSA employees were like Snowden in that they became dismayed to learn of such spying, Barrett said. Snowden is now residing in Russia under political asylum. ""There was a lot in common between them and Edward Snowden. They were horrified by what they learned. To me, they're arrogant. And they wanted to do something about it, and so they released information,"" Barrett said. Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney spoke in general terms about American spying prowess, noting how the nation enjoys ""a fantastic intelligence capability worldwide against all kinds of potential issues and concerns,"" especially in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks. ""The fact is, we do collect a lot of intelligence, without speaking about any particular target or group of targets,"" Cheney told CNN. ""That intelligence capability is enormously important to the United States, to our conduct of foreign policy, to the defense matters, to economic matters. And I'm a strong supporter of it."" Europe falls out of love with Obama over NSA spying claims . On the matter of national economies, experts agreed that intelligence agencies also examine an ally's commerce and industry. ""If the French were to be gathering intelligence in the United States, it's not that they were anticipating an American invasion in Normandy. It's to gather intelligence on American politics, maybe to do a little industrial espionage,"" Kupchan said. ""It's standard fare for intelligence agencies to do these type of things. That's why they're there. That's their raison d'etre."" One U.S. analyst had a blunt message for friends in Europe and elsewhere. ""I have a word of advice for American allies outraged by alleged NSA spying on their leaders: Grow up. That means you Germany. You, too, France. And you, Brazil. Mexico, too. Also the EU and the UN,"" blogged Max Boot in Commentary, referring in the two latter instances to the European Union and United Nations. ""Does the NSA spy on your leaders? Probably. Do you spy on leaders of allied states including the United States? Probably. You just don't have the resources or capability to spy as effectively as the NSA does. But if you did, you would."" 'I think that seems unseemly' But two Republican senators deemed the ongoing U.S. spying on allies wrong. ""To me from where I sit, it doesn't seem like a good idea or it doesn't seem to advance diplomacy for us to be spying on our allies particularly the personal phone of the president of Germany for 10 years. I think that seems unseemly. That goes against having relations with your allies,"" said Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she knew of ""no justification for the administration's collection of intelligence on the leaders of our closest allies,"" such as Merkel. She planned to tell the German ambassador this week of ""my belief that it was wrong for the Administration to engage in monitoring of the Chancellor's telephone calls,"" she said in a statement. The consequences of getting caught are possibly severe. Exacerbating allies' outrage is a backdrop of European disappointment about the perceived lack of progress by President Barack Obama's administration on closing the Guantanamo Bay terrorist detention facility and on the use of deadly drone strikes in Pakistan and elsewhere, experts say. The unfolding political firestorm is now ""sufficiently intense to force the United States to respond in more than a symbolic way,"" Kupchan said. Congress and the White House are expected to reform intelligence gathering, forge a new code of conduct when spying on friends, and impose greater transparency and oversight on the NSA, experts say. Key European partners are expected to be part of the conversation about the new conduct code, and separately, the European Union could tighten its own privacy laws, restricting the sharing of certain kinds of information with the United States, Kupchan said. What surprises historians such as Barrett is how American public opinion now disapproves of U.S. spying on allies. After the September 11 attacks, Americans held ""a strong view that we have to do everything"" in intelligence gathering, a mood that also enabled the passage of the landmark anti-terror Patriot Act, Barrett said. ""Now I think that attitude no longer prevails,"" Barrett said this week. ""If anything surprises me, it's that people seem to be so shocked and appalled"" by the spying on friends, he said.","Allies spying on one another has ""been going on for centuries,"" professor says .

"(CNN) -- ""There is a sense that he is 'one of us,' a true fan of comics."" That's how John Mayo, co-host of the Comic Book Page podcast, describes Geoff Johns, the chief creative officer at DC Comics and one of the most influential figures in comics today. All those trailers you've been seeing for the upcoming ""Green Lantern"" movie? A good chunk of the credit should go to Johns. He's a co-producer on the film, but he's also responsible for giving the character top billing recently in comics and, ultimately, in pop culture. Johns brought Hal Jordan back to life in the ""Green Lantern: Rebirth"" series and went on to cast the emerald warrior's world as the focal point of the DC Universe in the popular ""Blackest Night"" comic event. Now, he's taking on DC's newest large-scale series: ""Flashpoint,"" a world in which everything you know will change in a Flash. The first issue hits shelves Wednesday. ""I didn't want to take the DC universe, put it in a box, shake the box and pour it out,"" Johns said. ""I wanted to take the major characters and show what they could be like if they were put on a different path."" The one constant is another fan favorite that owes his recent reincarnation to Johns: the Silver Age Flash, Barry Allen. Some Flash Facts about the scarlet speedster: Allen is a police scientist who, thanks to an accident, was imbued with the Speed Force, an energy that turned him into the fastest man alive. He sacrificed his life during one of DC's first mega events, ""Crisis on Infinite Earths,"" back in the 1980s, but returned in recent years as a regular fixture in the DC world. Taking decades of mythology in new directions might seem like a daunting task. But Bob Bretall, Mayo's co-host on the Comic Book Page podcast, said it's a balancing act that Johns performs well. ""He can retool a character or his/her history to make it more relevant to current readers without throwing away or disrespecting the work of previous creators."" If you're not familiar with Allen's back story, Johns said, you don't need to worry about playing catch-up before diving into the new series. ""You get all you need to know about The Flash in 'Flashpoint 1,' and then you're exploring a whole new universe together. So you're seeing it through Flash's eyes for the very first time."" A fan's writer . Based on his track record, there's a good chance fans will be happy with the journey Johns is taking them on. ""Geoff Johns seems to be widely respected in the fan community, both as a writer and as a person,"" Mayo said. ""I think the fact that he delivers great stories on a routine basis has earned him a lot of goodwill."" Johns has a lot in common with those fans, since his early experiences with comics mirrored many of their own. He started reading in the 1980s, gravitating toward the big, colorful characters of the DC universe. But in a world often dominated by The Big Three -- Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman -- it was The Flash that grabbed Johns' attention. ""I thought his costume was amazing. I thought superspeed was really fascinating. I thought he had the greatest rogues' gallery,"" Johns said. ""Flash felt like a doorway to all these wonderful things."" An epic tale . The doorway he's taking readers through with ""Flashpoint"" is one that opens on more than one character. ""Flash is about speed and time and altering perceptions. I wanted to explore that on a DC-wide scale,"" Johns said. Doing things on a wide scale can present challenges for readers. Kathleen Saracen, manager at Titan Games & Comics in Smyrna, Georgia, said some customers grow frustrated about having to spend too much money on large crossover titles. ""Flashpoint"" has a five-issue main story, with more than a dozen planned miniseries and a handful of one-shot stories. Podcast hosts Bretall and Mayo think the sheer volume may overwhelm some fans. ""That's a lot to digest and lot of money to commit,"" Bretall said. Johns acknowledged the concerns but said the side miniseries are meant to be complementary, not obligatory. ""If you're interested, you can check out the other miniseries, but they're not vital to the main story. They expand and flesh out the world behind 'Flashpoint,' but you really only need to invest in the five main issues."" Can The Flash follow Green Lantern and jump to the forefront of pop culture? A big-screen adaptation is being developed, and Mayo and Bretall both feel that the character is popular enough for the ""Flashpoint"" series to do well. Johns said his ultimate goal is to increase that popularity. ""I wanted to create a book that would intrigue people enough to give Flash a shot,"" Johns said. ""My hope is that anyone who's not a Flash fan, by the end of issue five, will be a Flash fan, whether they're a current reader, lapsed reader or new reader.""","Geoff Johns is one of the most influential figures in comics today .

"The Democratic Party is waging a battle. They want to take back the House in the 2014 midterms and maintain their majority in the Senate. And one political front is with women. In recent years the Democratic Party has enjoyed a political advantage with women as more of them have voted for Democrats. The Republican Party admits errors leading to success of female Democrats. For instance, in the last election, Republican candidates, including Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin, marginalized women by espousing controversial opinions on rape and abortion. The situation was so crippling that Republican leaders conducted an ""autopsy"" after the 2012 election to evaluate the party's shortcomings. The image of the white man is something the Republican Party is having trouble breaking. Voters were reminded of the patrician perception just a couple of weeks ago during the government shutdown when House Republican leaders let the press in a meeting to take pictures as they worked. At the long table sat eight men in their shirtsleeves. Not one woman was present. Those examples of images and statements make a difference at the voting booth. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's nine-point loss among women to President Barack Obama. Additionally, of the 81 women members of Congress, only 19 are Republican. The story is similar in the Senate. But the Democrats aren't taking any chances. They don't want to lose their electoral advantage. Last year, they attacked the Republicans' anti-choice, anti-Obamacare and anti-higher minimum wage policies as a ""war on women."" This year they are launching a war with women. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, who chairs the Democratic National Committee, on Friday unveiled the Democratic Women's Alliance, a new initiative to ""target, motivate and mobilize women"" to vote and run for office. And they are throwing money, resources and staff at the effort. They will conduct polls and gather data directed at women voters, find the forgotten women voters and train women to become involved or run for office. It was rolled out at the 20th anniversary of the DNC's Women's Leadership Forum where House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi spoke as did Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood. Republicans are ""trying to reach out to women,"" Wasserman Schultz said in a hotel ballroom full of women activists. ""Isn't that adorable?"" she smirked. ""Outreach is inserting themselves into the most private decisions women make,"" she added. Wasserman Schultz's entire message wasn't about beating the Republicans. She said that when women sit at the table, they bring solutions. ""We understand the role of compromise. When we're at the table, government is more responsible,"" Wasserman Schultz told the audience, referring to the latest gridlock in Washington that partially shut down the government. ""Even with Sarah Palin involved, we could've struck an agreement,"" the Florida congresswoman said. The return of Sarah Palin . Her goals, however, are still specific: Enroll more women into the Democratic Party. Republicans admit that they have some work to do. ""We hurt ourselves,"" Republican National Committee spokes woman Kirsten Kukowski told CNN. ""But we need to start fighting back on that narrative,"" she added. The RNC has recently launched some of its own initiatives focused on women. One of those programs is Blackboard to Blacktop, an education program to enhance women's role in the party. In addition, Kurkowski said they must do a better job of pushing back against damaging rhetoric by their candidates. ""All of us need to do a better job,"" she said. ""We're being much more conscious of it and tackling it every single day,"" she added.","The Democratic Party is launching a new initiative to attract women .
The goal is to widen the advantage the Democrats have with women voters .
The Republican Party knows it has work to do and has launched its own efforts ."
"(CNN)The United States is maintaining a list of about two dozen or so top ISIS operatives in Iraq and Syria that it hopes to target in airstrikes, according to a senior U.S. official. The list essentially amounts to a kill list, since the United States has no troops on the ground in Iraq or Syria to capture ISIS suspects. The No. 1 target on the list is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS. One U.S. official said al-Baghdadi is well-aware the United States is hunting him, so the belief is he is staying out of sight. It's been months since the last intelligence report about where al-Baghdadi is hiding, a senior U.S. official tells CNN. The United States believes al-Baghdadi knows warplanes are hunting him, so he moves cautiously -- even as his influence has grown beyond Syria and Iraq. The United States has already killed a dozen or so ISIS operatives on the list, including an ISIS chemical weapons expert, the senior official says. But others are added to the list as intelligence is gained about their role in ISIS. The official strongly emphasized that the command-and-control structure of ISIS remains murky and more intelligence is needed about the identity of top operatives. ISIS executioners such as so-called Jihadi John are still in the U.S. crosshairs -- but the list focuses on targeting those whose death would broadly hurt ISIS. The kill list may now expand as the United States struggles to understand an ISIS command structure made more confusing by the growth of ISIS adherents in Egypt, Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Libya. One analyst cautions those labeling themselves as ISIS might have very different goals. ""We have to take each terrorist or cult organization in every country as a separate entity. We can't look at it as one big group. You may miss the most important targets when you are doing that,"" said Mark Hertling, CNN military analyst. The growing -- and alarming -- reach of ISIS . The execution of Egyptian Christians on the Libyan coastline underscores the targeting problem. The United States wants to identify the killers. But the broader worry is ISIS' position in Libya. It now has a stronghold in Derna and operates across Libyan coastal areas within reach of southern Europe via busy shipping lanes. ""It's very difficult to have the same kind of controls over people who might be getting on boats who might be working as stevedores or laborers on ships that are coming into European ports,"" Hertling said.","The No. 1 target on the list is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, a senior U.S. official says .

"British journalist John Cantlie hadn't been seen in nearly two years. Now, he's the latest hostage to be paraded out by ISIS -- forced to deliver the group's message. In a video released Thursday, Cantlie -- wearing an orange shirt and seated alone at a desk with a black backdrop -- says he is sending what will be the first in a series of messages on behalf of the group that calls itself the Islamic State. Since Cantlie is delivering ISIS propaganda and makes clear in the video he is speaking under duress, CNN is not showing the video on its platforms. In recent weeks, ISIS has drawn growing attention for spewing brutal propaganda across social media -- messages meant both to terrify and recruit Westerners. The group appears to have a well-funded, well-organized social media and video production effort. Its videos are slickly produced, with high production values. This month, a federal law enforcement official told CNN a former Boston resident and U.S. citizen may have joined ISIS and started helping with its online efforts. Cantlie, a photojournalist who also wrote several articles for major British newspapers, was kidnapped in November 2012 along with American journalist James Foley. ISIS released a video showing Foley's execution last month. This month the group released videos showing the executions of two other Western hostages, American journalist Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines. Cantlie's LinkedIn profile describes him as a journalist and photographer with 20 years' experience specializing in working in hostile environments, including Afghanistan, Somalia, Libya and Syria. ""I love stories of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances,"" he wrote in an online portfolio describing his work. He was previously abducted in Syria with a Dutch journalist in July 2012. Both were shot when they tried to escape through a hole in their tent. ""We stepped out the back and ran for our lives,"" he said in a television interview describing the failed escape attempt. Several days later, they were rescued by Free Syrian Army rebels. On his return, Cantlie reported that some of the hostage-takers were British, including a London-based doctor who treated his gunshot wounds. In London's Sunday Times, he described his experience being held at a camp in Syria. The British citizens there were seemingly of mixed ethnicities and spoke of a wider war after Syria ""because when they learn that Sharia (law) is spreading into Syria, then we will be at war with America,"" Cantlie told the Times. Just a few months later, Cantlie returned to Syria, only to be kidnapped again. In the video, he says he was captured by the Islamic State after he returned to Syria in November 2012. Now, ISIS is using him, as a journalist, as a British hostage, forcing him to deliver their message. In the video, Cantlie says he will be telling the story of the other side of ISIS. ""You're thinking, 'He's only doing this because he's a prisoner. He's got a gun at his head, and he's being forced to do this.' Right? Well, it's true. I am a prisoner. That I cannot deny,"" Cantlie says in the video. ""But seeing as I've been abandoned by my government and my fate now lies in the hands of the Islamic State, I have nothing to lose."" Contacted by CNN about the video, a British official said the Foreign & Commonwealth Office is assessing the production, considering its implications and trying to contact Cantlie's family.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- The young woman who last weekend emerged as a powerful symbol of opposition to the Iranian government embraced life in many ways, but there was little about her that would have led her friends to predict she would become a martyr, one of them told CNN. Neda Agha-Soltan, 26, enjoyed music and was looking forward to learning how to play the piano. Neda Agha-Soltan, 26, rose to prominence within hours after a crudely shot video documenting her final moments was uploaded to the Web shortly after she died Saturday from a single gunshot wound to the chest. ""It's heartbreaking,"" President Obama said Tuesday in Washington, referring to the video of the woman the world has come to know simply as Neda, which means ""divine calling"" in Farsi. ""And I think anyone who sees it knows there's something fundamentally unjust about it."" Since Saturday, the Iranian government has sought to minimize the impact of her death, but one of her friends on Tuesday described her to CNN in an attempt to inject life and context into what has been -- for much of the rest of the world -- just a few seconds of powerful, if grainy, video. Much about her remains unclear, but here is what CNN has learned from at least one source: . The second of three children, Neda lived with her parents in a middle-class neighborhood east of Tehran. She was a happy, positive person. Though she studied philosophy and religion at the Azad Islamic University, she was more spiritual than religious. She also loved music. She once studied violin but had given it up and was planning to take up piano next. She had just bought a piano, but it had not yet been delivered. Her demeanor was typically calm, even serene, but she had a quirky, playful sense of humor. A friend recalled that once, when Neda was visiting her friend's house, she picked up a white Teddy bear, took off her big, purple-studded earrings and put them on the bear. Then she removed a necklace from around the neck of a friend and put it around the bear's neck, taking delight in the bear's transformation. She liked to travel, having visited Turkey three months ago with a tour group. And she believed in human rights, her friend said.  See gallery of Neda and the effect of her life » . That may have explained why she was at an anti-government demonstration in Tehran on Saturday afternoon. After being stuck in traffic for more than an hour inside a Peugeot 206 -- a subcompact with a poorly working air conditioner -- Neda and a family friend decided to get out of the car for some fresh air. Shaky video captured on a cell phone shows her walking with the man, a teacher of music and philosophy, near an anti-government demonstration. The two are near where protesters were chanting in opposition to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, whose calls for an end to anti-government demonstrations have sparked defiance across the nation. Neda, wearing a baseball cap over a black scarf, a black shirt, blue jeans and tennis shoes, does not appear to be chanting and seems to be observing the demonstration. Suddenly, Neda is on the ground -- felled by a single gunshot wound to the chest. Several men kneel at her side and place pressure on her chest in an attempt to stop the bleeding. ""She has been shot! Someone, come and take her!"" shouts one man. By now, Neda's eyes have rolled to her right; her body is limp. Blood streams from her mouth, then from her nose. For a second, her face is hidden from view as the phone camera goes behind one of the men. When Neda's face comes back into view, it is covered with blood. Then, the teacher pleads with her by name. ""Neda, do not be afraid, do not be afraid,"" he repeats. Another man curses as the first man begins to wail. ""Somebody come and get her in a car and take her away!"" a voice pleads. She was taken to a nearby hospital and, within a day, she was buried at Behesht Zahra, the city's largest Muslim cemetery, on the outskirts of the capital. A friend of hers interprets the fact that her body was released so quickly as a tacit acknowledgment by the government that the killing was carried out by government forces. That theory is supported by the fact that Iran's strict gun-control laws mean private citizens cannot carry firearms, the friend said. Since her death, public displays of mourning for Neda have been prohibited, the friend said. A gathering of about 60 people at a mosque was broken up by members of the Basij, the pro-government vigilantes blamed for much of the violence against demonstrators, according to New York Times columnist Roger Cohen, who observed the incident. iReport.com: Share your views on unrest in Iran . Neda's family has not been allowed to post a black banner of mourning outside the family's house, the friend said. Yet Neda's influence may not diminish soon. Under Muslim tradition, the seventh and 40th days after someone dies are devoted to mourning and reflection.","Neda Agha-Soltan, 26, was the second of three children from middle-class family .

"FBI agents interviewed one of the suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings two years ago, but found no connection with terror groups. An FBI official said agents interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev in 2011 at the request of the Russian government. ""The request stated that it was based on information that he was a follower of radical Islam and a strong believer, and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the United States for travel to the country's region to join unspecified underground groups,""  the FBI said in a statement. The FBI said it took a number of investigative steps to check on the request, including looking at his travel history, checking databases for derogatory information and searching for Web postings. Agents also interviewed Tsarnaev's family members, the FBI said, but did not detect terrorist activity. Boston suspects: Immigrant dream to American nightmare . ""The FBI did not find any terrorism activity, domestic or foreign, and those results were provided to the foreign government in the summer of 2011,"" the FBI's statement said. ""The FBI requested but did not receive more specific or additional information from the foreign government."" U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said Friday that information that Tsarnaev had been interviewed by the FBI in the past was disturbing. ""It's new information to me and it's very disturbing that he's on the FBI's radar screen,"" McCaul told CNN's Erin Burnett. No immediate suggestion of accomplices in bombings . McCaul praised the FBI's efforts investigating the case since Monday's bombings. ""But if he was on the radar and they let him out of their sights, then that's an issue, certainly, for me,"" McCaul said. The suspects' parents told Russian state media that the FBI had been speaking with their sons. Analysis: Older suspect in bombings grew increasingly religious, analysis shows . ""FBI came to them two or three times, asking 'Are you Chechens? Is anyone harassing you?' Why would anyone offend us? Then they came again. Said they wanted to talk to Tamerlan. We didn't know what was going on, didn't know whether he had done something. But they were saying, 'Oh, it's nothing, it's just routine.' They talked to us at our home,"" father  Anzor Tsarnaev  told the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. ""I heard myself that they (the FBI) said: 'We know that you read, what you drink, what you eat, where you go.' And then they added that that's routine practice to prevent bombings on the streets of Boston, so that our kids can go to school in peace. This conversation happened half a year ago. But I keep asking, why did they have to talk to him about that then?"" Mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva told Russia Today that the FBI had been checking on Tamerlan for three to five years. ""They knew what he was doing, what sites he was visiting. They followed his every move, yet today they say this is a terrorist act,"" she said. ""The FBI was afraid of my eldest son because he was a leader, could stand up for himself, and talked about Islam a lot. Once they officially called me and told me that they don't doubt his decency. But at the same time they said he gets information from extremists' sites and that they are very afraid of him."" Earlier Friday, a U.S. official familiar with the latest intelligence information on the Boston Marathon bombings said initial indications were that the two suspects do not have direct links to any major al Qaeda group or affiliates, or to a new significant terrorist threat to the United States. What their family has to say . These are some early assessments but far from final conclusions, the official said. The assessments are part of a full interagency review now under way by the U.S. intelligence and law enforcement community, who are going back through their databases and information looking for any links to the two men. The intelligence review earlier Friday had focused to a large extent on regional militant connections the men have had in Russia or Central Asia. But the official also noted they simply may have been ""inspired"" by a militant ideology or may simply have been disgruntled persons aiming to carry out an attack, and had no connections to foreign groups. ""We simply don't know yet,"" he said. The review was ordered by James Clapper, director of National Intelligence. Initially, before the men were identified by the FBI, the review was looking at any indications of a threat emerging from overseas against the United States. Once the identities of the men became known, with their possible ethnic Chechen background, the focus shifted. The intelligence community is tasked under the review with checking any intelligence gathered overseas while the FBI will focus on what is known inside the United States.

"Turkey made a significant policy shift Monday when it announced it would allow Kurdish Peshmerga fighters from northern Iraq to travel through the Turkish territory to reinforce the besieged Kurdish town of Kobani in northern Syria. The announcement was all the more striking, because earlier this month Turkey's President equated the Kurdish militants defending Kobani to the ISIS fighters who were laying siege to the town. Both the Kurdish and ISIS militants are, in the words of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, ""terrorists."" ""Turkey feels like it has fallen into the subway tracks and is surrounded by live rails,"" said Hugh Pope, senior Turkey analyst with the International Crisis Group, a conflict mediation organization. ""It is very difficult for Turkey to make any choice."" Turkey to let Iraqi Kurds use its territory to reinforce Kobani . Turkey's historically troubled relations with its own ethnic Kurdish population is one reason Ankara balked at joining the U.S.-led coalition bombing the militants who call themselves the Islamic State. Fighting triggers violence within Turkey . But Turkey's noninterference policy came at a cost. The scenes of Kurdish and ISIS fighters locked in a death struggle on the border, as well as the images of more than 100,000 desperate Syrian Kurds fleeing to Turkish territory, triggered spasms of deadly violence between rival factions within Turkey. Kurdish politicians in Turkey accused the Turkish government of siding with ISIS by refusing to arm Kobani's defenders. Kurds then took to the streets in protest. More than 30 people were killed in cities around Turkey this month as ethnic Kurds clashed with Islamist and nationalist groups as well as Turkish police. Violent protests over ISIS sweep Turkey . ""All of these constituencies are getting fired up by the scenes on television that they're seeing in the Middle East,"" said Pope of the International Crisis Group. ""This has led for the first time in 20 years to gangs taking to the streets and killing each other."" Disruption on peaceful campus . On Friday, the battle for Kobani was felt at one of Turkey's most elite institutions, Bogazici University. On a leafy campus overlooking Istanbul's Bosphorus Strait, friends, relatives and fellow academics gathered to remember a 30-year old sociologist named Suphi Nejat Agirnasli. Agirnasli, a member of Turkey's Marxist-Leninist Communist Party, was reported killed this month in Kobani after he volunteered to join Kurdish militants defending the city. Mourners waved red communist flags and chanted ""ISIS killers"" as they marched carrying Agirnasli's portrait through the usually peaceful campus. Agirnasli's death shocked some Turks, who have felt Turkey's largest city was somehow insulated from the turmoil in the Middle East. ""I never thought that someone from our university would actually go there and get killed,"" said Suveyda Cil, 19, a Bogazici student. ""I never thought I was so close to these situations because it's so far from Istanbul, but now it's so close."" One of Agirnasli's professors said he understood why his former student volunteered to fight alongside the Kurds, even though Agirnasli wasn't a Kurd. ""What's going on in Kobani today is basically kind of a struggle against barbarians ... against people who have no sense of humanity,"" said Zafer Yenal, the head of Bogazici's sociology department.  ""Probably (Suphi) Nejat was very shocked.  He basically saw this and wanted to be there in some capacity."" Battle for Kobani threatens peace talks . An estimated 20% of Turkey's population is made up of ethnic Kurds. Historically, the Turkish government has persecuted and marginalized this community, referring to them for years as ""mountain Turks."" In 1984, a group of Marxist-inspired guerrillas calling themselves the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, began fighting an insurgent war against the Turkish state. The conflict would ebb and flow for the next 30 years. The PKK initially fought to carve an independent Kurdistan out of Kurdish-populated regions of Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran. But the bulk of the bloodshed took place in southeastern Turkey, resulting in the deaths of more than 30,000 people over three decades. The PKK was accused of assassinating teachers, police officers and rival Kurdish activists. Meanwhile, the Turkish security forces demolished hundreds of Kurdish villages in an attempt to destroy support for the separatists. The United States and European Union joined their NATO ally Turkey in labeling the PKK a terrorist organization. Since coming to power in Turkey some 12 years ago, Erdogan pushed to open peace talks with the PKK. Meanwhile, the PKK has dropped its demands for an independent state, instead calling for greater autonomy and cultural and linguistic rights within Turkey. ""This peace process is one of the only good things happening in the Middle East today,"" Pope said. But the Kobani-related violence inside Turkey has threatened to derail the peace process. ISIS finds some support within Turkey . Complicating matters further is that ISIS has found some support within Turkey's majority Muslim society. Hundreds of Turks are believed to have joined the movement. Some appeared in propaganda videos urging their countrymen to join ISIS' ranks. ""We have come here to Syria for jihad to practice God's religion, to practice jihad on God's path, and to gain God's sustenance to, God willing, go to his heaven,"" one bearded man holding a machine gun told the camera in Turkish. Another unnamed Turkish militant explained in a video why he left his three children behind in Istanbul to join ISIS in Syria. ""When the children are dying here, my conscience did not let me stay and love my children. If you come here, there is dignity, honor, everything is here,"" the man said. ""Instead of staying in Turkey and living in contempt, standing guard here for one night would be better for you."" ISIS supporters have emerged on at least one Istanbul university campus. On September 26, students filmed more than 10 men wearing masks and carrying clubs yelling, ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is great""), in the literature department at Istanbul University. The video then showed these Islamist students attacking leftist students who had been protesting against ISIS. The International Crisis Group's Pope said that when it comes to ISIS ""there's a conflicted feeling in Turkey. There's a condemnation of the methods. At the same time there's a sympathy for the cause."" One Turk strongly sympathizing with ISIS is Ali Osman Zor, a self-described ""Islamic revolutionary"" and enthusiastic member of the Great Eastern Islamic Raiders' Front. Zor, who spent several years in prison on terrorism convictions, now edits a magazine published in Istanbul that endorses ISIS. In an interview with CNN, Zor said he supported ISIS' violent methods, arguing they were a natural response to what he claimed were decades of Western imperialism in the Middle East as well as Kurdish and Shiite Muslim persecution of Sunni Muslims in Iraq. ""We saw one man killed,"" Zor said, referring to the multiple beheadings and executions ISIS militants filmed on camera and distributed over social media. ""What about all the people killed by U.S. airstrikes? We haven't forgotten about Abu Ghraib,"" he added, referring to the notorious prison where Americans soldiers were photographed abusing Iraqi prisoners during the U.S. occupation of Iraq. Pope advises against Turkey being drawn further into the Syrian civil war. ""Turkey has all the fractures you have in the Middle East: the sectarian Sunni-non-Sunni divide, the ethnic divide between Kurds and Turks, the political divide between Islamists and non-Islamists,"" he warned. ""All these fault lines can break open in a very bad way."" On Monday, a top adviser to the Turkish President defended Ankara's decision not to attack ISIS. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, deputy secretary-general of the presidency, Ibrahim Kalin, argued instead that the U.S.-led coalition should focus on overthrowing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. ""ISIS's barbaric beheadings and summary executions, horrible and disgusting as they are, should not shadow the war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated by Mr. Assad,"" Kalin wrote. ""Hitting ISIS while ignoring the Assad regime alone is a shortsighted strategy that will not end the bloodshed in Syria and Iraq.""","Turkey has balked at joining the U.S.-led coalition bombing of ISIS .

"""I was hiding behind a water tank in the front yard and saw them killing my father and brother and [taking] away my mother and sister. I don't know anything about them since,"" says Dunya, a 14-year-old Yazidi girl. ""They put us in trucks and drove us to a big building, before transferring us to a hall across the road,"" explains Solav, 19 and also Yazidi. ""Then their seniors came and started condemning our religion and asking us to convert to Islam ... They separated me along with other young ones and ordered us to stay there while taking away the elderly women. ""The man I was given to raped me several times and then left me in the room on my own. I was shaking from pain and fear in that hot room, my entire body sweating. Suddenly, another man came and did what he wanted to do despite me crying and begging him, kissing his foot to leave me alone ..."" Dunya and Solav (not their real names) now live with their relatives in newly-established displaced persons camps in Iraq's Duhok governorate. They are among thousands of Yazidi women abducted by jihadists during their attack on the Sinjar district on 2 August 2014. Since then, one hundred girls and women have managed to escape their jailers and rejoin their community. According to our field work, which has involved interviews with witnesses and survivors, and based on other reports which have reached us, more than 2,500 Yazidi girls and women were abducted during the attack. Women sold 'like cattle' The extent of the ISIS brutality toward those women is unknown. We do know from witness statements and testimonies by survivors that they have been systematically separated by age and physical appearance, forced to convert to Islam, and subjected to different forms of physical and sexual violence, including rape and sex slavery. The jihadists themselves have confirmed these acts through their media outlets, such as the English website Dabiq, saying the acts were established aspects of Sharia, because they view Yazidis as heretics who should face conversion or die. According to the spokesman for the Iraqi Red Cross, Muhammad al-Khuza'ee, the abducted Yazidi women ""were taken as spoils of war and exposed at a market for sale"". The enslaved women have been treated like cattle -- complete with price tags -- and trafficked in markets in Mosul in Iraq, and Raqqa in Syria. Their ""prices"" have varied between $25 and $1,000. They were ""cheaply sold"" and mainly given to youngsters as a way to encourage them to join ISIS. Those women who resisted were killed, and some committed suicide. These forms of violence are used as war strategies by the jihadists to subjugate the entire community, to inculcate fear, to undermine community and family structures, and to pollute the bloodline of the population. Severe psychological trauma . Local authorities, in coordination with community leaders and activists, have been working on strategies to rescue and care for the enslaved women. These include negotiation with Arab tribal leaders in the areas under ISIS control to help free the women and ensure their safe return to their families, raising awareness, and preventive and protective measures to help survivors reintegrate into their family and community structures. The rescue strategies consist of large efforts to liberate the abducted women; so far, around 100 have reached Mount Sinjar, where they now live in overflowing cities and towns, mainly in Duhok and Erbil governorates. Officials and humanitarian organizations have been busy providing aid and care facilities via a health team of doctors and social workers, but they face a challenge: the level of need is much higher than that local authorities are equipped to deal with. In addition to physical wounds, the women have suffered severe psychological trauma. The situation is distressing and requires an urgent need for explicit psychological as well as gynecological treatment. The international community should take the case seriously and address intervention strategies with urgent implementation measures. Since the ISIS attack, the Yazidi community has been subjected to horrendous crimes, including murder, the destruction of their homes, arrest and kidnapping, enforced disappearance as well as displacement, torture and sexual slavery, and desecration of their holy shrines. As Kurds and Yazidis, they are condemned as heretics and devil worshippers. Acts of genocide . These acts are categorized as crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court, but they are also acts of genocide: they consist of a systematic, intentional and well planned operation to eliminate an entire group because of its ethnic and religious identity. The international community should mobilize resources and establish a fact-finding commission of experts to investigate and collect evidence from eye-witnesses, highlighting sexual violence against women. Such timely data and documentation should facilitate not only the prosecution of those responsible, but also the international recognition of these acts as genocide. The process should also include support mechanisms for healing, reparation, compensation, preserving memories and the reintegration of these women into normal life, including much needed post-trauma support for victims and families after their release. The Kurdistan Region is overwhelmed by the plight of refugees and Internally Displaced Persons, with more than 1.5 million people living in camps and others still sheltering in community halls or being hosted by the local population or their relatives. The Kurdish authorities are willing to cooperate with international agencies with the aim of providing all necessary aid to these populations, facilitating the prosecution of those responsible and the international recognition of the acts carried out against Yazidis as genocide.

"If you blink during the video, you might miss the moment an explosion destroys what is said to have been the tomb of Jonah, a key figure in Christianity, Judaism and Islam. The first few frames show the revered shrine towering over its landscape. Then comes a sudden burst of dust, fire and smoke. Then, nothing. Militants with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, planted explosives around the tomb and detonated them remotely Thursday, civil defense officials there told CNN. The holy site is said to be the burial place of the prophet Jonah, who was swallowed by a whale or great fish in the Islamic and Judeo-Christian traditions. CNN could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video, which was posted to YouTube. The tomb was inside a Sunni mosque called the Mosque of the Prophet Yunus, which is Arabic for Jonah. ISIS is waging war against the Iraqi government and has taken over several cities. It is seeking to create an Islamic caliphate that encompasses parts of Iraq and Syria and has begun imposing Sharia law in the towns it controls. ISIS is part of a puritanical strain of Islam that considers all religious shrines -- Islamic, Christian, Jewish, etc. -- idolatrous. Biblical scholars are divided on whether the tomb in Mosul actually belonged to Jonah. In the Jewish tradition, he returns to his hometown of Gath-Hepher after his mission to Nineveh. And some modern scholars say the Jonah story is more myth than history. Still, the story of Jonah is told often in the Christian tradition and has special resonance for that faith, scholars Joel S. Baden and Candida Moss write in a piece on CNN's Belief Blog. ""In Christian tradition, the story of Jonah is an important one,"" they say. ""Jonah's descent into the depths in the belly of the great fish and subsequent triumphant prophetic mission to Nineveh is seen as a reference to and prototype of the death and resurrection of Jesus."" Baden is professor of Hebrew Bible at Yale Divinity School. Moss is a professor of New Testament and early Christianity at the University of Notre Dame. They refer to the destruction of Jonah's tomb as ""an attack on both those Christians living in Iraq today and on the rich, if little-known, Christian heritage of the region."" The book of Jonah tells the story of him balking at first when God tells him to go to Nineveh to preach. Instead, Jonah sails in another direction, where he encounters a great storm and winds up being swallowed by a great fish. He spends a few days in the belly of the fish before emerging alive to follow God's instruction to go to Nineveh. Mosul, the second-largest city in Iraq, is near Nineveh, once a powerful city of the ancient world. Christian families fled Mosul this month after the al Qaeda splinter group issued an ultimatum to Iraqi Christians living there: Convert to Islam, pay a fine or face ""death by the sword."" ISIS has blown up several Sunni holy sites in the last few weeks in Mosul. Last month, it destroyed seven Shiite places of worship in the predominantly Shiite Turkmen city of Tal Afar, about 31 miles (50 kilometers) west of Mosul, Human Rights Watch has reported, citing local sources.

"Hoping to ease suffering in Syria's besieged cities, the UN Security Council unanimously passed a resolution to boost access for humanitarian aid. All 15 Security Council member states approved the resolution, including Russian and China which had balked in the past. The document calls for an end to violence, including the use of barrel bombs, and condemns al Qaeda-affiliated terror attacks. The council strongly condemned Syrian authorities for widespread violations of humanitarian law and urged all parties to lift sieges of populated areas, including in Aleppo, Damascus and Homs. ""This resolution holds the promise of something real,"" U.S. Secretary John Kerry said in a statement. ""But these steps are only first steps. The test is whether the words of the Security Council are matched with the life-saving actions the Syrian people so desperately and urgently need,"" Kerry said. The resolution does not call for any sanctions or punishment and only refers to ""further steps"" should it not be implemented. ""Russia has backed the resolution when it was agreed upon and became balanced,"" said Russia's UN Representative Vitaly Churkin, according to the state-run Syrian news agency, SANA. Syria's UN Representative Bashar al-Jaafari said that humanitarian support to Syrians cannot be carried out correctly and effectively unless actions match words on not politicizing humanitarian issues and unless it goes hand in hand with stopping terrorism, according to SANA. Violence continued Saturday in Syria. The local Coordination Committees, a network of opposition activists, reported at least 59 dead -- including nine children and nine women -- around the country, with the majority of those deaths in Aleppo province. CNN cannot independently verify daily death tolls, but the United Nations says more than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria since 2011.","The resolution is unanimous .

"Nurse Kaci Hickox says it's her right to roam outside her home, but leaders in Maine warn she could be a threat to public welfare. Yes, Hickox recently treated people with Ebola in West Africa, but she has no symptoms of the disease, and has twice tested negative. ""To put me in prison is just inhumane,"" Hickox said about being placed into an involuntary quarantine after she landed last week at the Newark, New Jersey, airport after working in Sierra Leone. ""I just feel like fear is winning right now, and when fear wins, everyone loses."" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie disagreed. Citing public safety, officials had Hickox spend more than 65 hours in mandatory quarantine outside a hospital before she was released and transported to her home in Maine. Chris Christie on Ebola policy: 'We're not moving an inch' Officials in Maine also disagree with the nurse. Gov. Paul LePage says he will ""exercise the full extent of his authority allowable by law"" to keep her away from public places. Tensions are running high. A police cruiser trailed Hickox and her boyfriend as they took an hourlong bicycle ride through rural Maine Thursday -- a move the governor said was meant to protect the nurse. The showdown between Hickox and Maine officials strikes at a larger dilemma about what health workers ought to do when they return home from fighting the unprecedented Ebola outbreak in Africa, especially when the doctors and nurses show no symptoms of the deadly virus. It's an emotional debate that pits individual liberty against public safety, now elevated to a high public drama because Hickox has been outspoken against a quarantine. ""I'm fighting for something much more than myself,"" she said Wednesday after emerging from the home where she had been staying. ""There are so many aid workers coming back. It scares me to think how they're going to be treated and how they're going to feel."" Raw emotions . Ebola's arrival to U.S. soil this year has caused a visceral reaction among some Americans who advocate quarantines as a prudent vigilance against a disease with no established cure. But medical experts say that reaction is merely fear, and they explain that an individual without the virus' symptoms is no public threat at all. That doesn't satisfy some Americans who demand a higher precaution: they want health care workers to be in quarantine for 21 days, the incubation period for the Ebola virus. They cite how Dr. Craig Spencer, 33, a Doctors Without Borders physician, moved freely about New York City for days until he developed Ebola. Spencer just returned from treating Ebola patients in Guinea. New Jersey's 21-day quarantine policy drew sharp criticism from Hickox, who described it as a ""knee-jerk reaction by politicians to Ebola."" Illinois and California announced similar 21-day quarantine orders this week on anyone who has had contact with an Ebola patient in affected areas of West Africa. It's an approach Maine's top health official says she wants the state to take -- and an idea that one of Hickox's neighbors said he supports. ""Why she's being so defiant, I'm not sure,"" neighbor Jim Majka said, ""but it's causing consternation here, and people are trying to ask why she won't honor it. It's a simple thing: Stay in the quarantine until it's over, and we're good."" President Barack Obama tried to quash that public sentiment this week by inviting to the White House a group of U.S. health workers who worked in African Ebola zones. After being in direct contact with those non-symptomatic workers, Obama reiterated how there's no public danger when a health worker doesn't have symptoms of the virus. ""We don't react to our fears, but instead, we respond with common sense and skill and courage. That's the best of our history -- not fear, not hysteria, not misinformation,"" Obama said. But in a move that seemed to contradict the White House, the Pentagon this week put 30 U.S. soldiers in quarantine -- or ""controlled monitoring"" -- in Italy after they were stationed in Ebola-stricken West Africa. Army major general speaks to CNN from inside Ebola quarantine . High stakes . At stake in the quarantine debate is the fight against Ebola itself, advocates say. Specifically, it's the ability of health care workers who fight Ebola at its source to return immediately to their private and professional lives. A 21-day quarantine would discourage this rare pool of labor from taking on such hazardous duty in Africa, advocates say. If there are fewer doctors and nurses on the Ebola front, there's a likelihood that the epidemic in West Africa could spread, experts say. The rights of these health workers once they return home is governed by U.S. guidelines and health laws that ultimately favor states over the federal government. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now requires greater symptom monitoring of doctors and nurses returning from West Africa, but stops short of requiring any type of quarantine, according to new rules implemented this week. States have the power to exceed those CDC guidelines, and some do. ""We have a federal system in this country in which states are given significant authority for governing their constituents. That is certainly true when it comes to public safety and public health,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said this week. ""What we believe is important -- and I think this is a view that is shared by governors and local officials across the country -- is that these kinds of policies should be driven by science and the best scientific advice that is available."" The humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders, for which Hickox worked while in West Africa, condemned ""blanket forced quarantine for health care workers returning from Ebola affected countries,"" the organization said this week. ""Such a measure is not based upon established medical science,"" the group said. The group supports ""scientifically grounded monitoring"" for homeward-bound aid workers, which ""is in accordance with the recommendations of public health experts."" The virus is spread through the direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infectious person -- that is, someone who shows symptoms of the virus -- and with surfaces and materials contaminated with those fluids. People remain infectious as long as their blood and bodily fluids contain the virus, and men can still transmit the virus through breast milk and semen for up to seven weeks after they recover from the disease, the World Health Organization says. How the Ebola virus spreads . Division among supporters . To demonstrate how the Hickox case can divide even the most sympathetic supporters, the freelance NBC cameraman who was a former Ebola patient endorsed Hickox's declarations that she has a human and constitutional right to exit her home and roam the outdoors. But would Ashoka Mukpo make that choice himself in the aftermath of his recovery from Ebola? Not entirely, he said. Even though the cameraman is now free of the virus, he recently chose not to visit a Halloween gathering because he didn't want to provoke public anxiety at a jack-o'-lantern exhibition attended by more 8,000 people. ""You know, I just worry about making people uncomfortable. I think I need a couple of weeks out of the hospital where I really can say, look, I've been fine for three weeks,"" Mukpo told CNN. Ashoka Mukpo: Ebola 'more intense than anything' Mukpo's concern has a precedent: When NBC chief medical editor Dr. Nancy Snyderman violated a precautionary 21-day quarantine to reportedly obtain takeout food, she provoked public outrage. That anger was expressed on Snyderman's Facebook page. ""It is quite obvious that Snyderman is an arrogant and egotistical woman who has no concern/regard for anyone but herself,"" one man wrote. ""I hope this doesn't just 'blow over' in a month and NBC doesn't allow you to return to your position as chief medical correspondent,"" one woman wrote. Snyderman later apologized for how members of her team, which had visited Ebola-infected Liberia, ""violated"" quarantine guidelines. Court challenge . Mary Mayhew, Maine's health commissioner, has said the process to seek a court order imposing a quarantine on Hickox has already begun. It's not entirely clear which side would win that court battle, partly because Ebola is regarded as a menace with no established cure and partly because there's no evidence that Hickox has the disease, let alone a symptom suggesting it, experts say. Under the U.S. Constitution, states have the authority over public health issues, except at international airports and seaports, where the federal government has jurisdiction, said attorney Steven Gravely, who wrote Virginia's quarantine laws. ""We quarantine folks who have been exposed to a communicable disease, but who are not yet infected,"" Gravely said. ""The goal is to try to keep people who have been exposed, who may or may not be sick, from infecting other people. And so there's a sound basis for quarantine medically, but there's a lot of debate about whether -- what New York and New Jersey did was really appropriate."" Science vs. politics . Hickox's attorneys contend there is no medical evidence that Hickox has any sign of Ebola. She's therefore no threat to society, her attorneys say. Rather, Maine's effort to seek a mandatory quarantine is based on politics, not science, said one of Hickox's attorneys, Normal Siegel. ""This should not be directed and led by the politicians. It should be led by the medical community,"" Siegel said. ""The government can't take away your liberty unless there is a compelling basis for it."" The absence of any illness in Hickox is among the more salient facets of the expected court case, said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. ""Maine has a law, like all states have law, that say people with contagious diseases can be forced in quarantine,"" Toobin said. ""The legal question... is whether her condition, in perfectly good health without symptoms, counts as something that is covered by the law. That is a hard legal question because judges usually defer to public health authorities about their sense of risk. ""But here every scientific expert says that people without symptoms are not contagious,"" Toobin added. ""I think this is going to be a very hard legal problem unless her lawyers and the state of Maine can work out some sort of compromise.""

"A suspected jihadist accused of a deadly shooting at Belgium's Jewish Museum also guarded Western hostages while fighting with ISIS in Syria, according to a French journalist and former captive. Nicolas Henin -- who was released in April from captivity in Syria  -- told reporters Saturday that suspect Mehdi Nemmouche not only was one of his captors, but that he tortured and beat those in his charge. ""I've been given a number of graphic and audio materials that allowed me to be certain that the fighter that I met in Syria during my captivity was indeed Mehdi Nemmouche,"" he said during a news conference held in Paris. Henin told CNN he spent seven of the 10 months he was held with beheaded U.S. journalist James Foley, making it possible that Nemmouche would also have come in contact with him. He told reporters Nemmouche physically assaulted him a number of times during his captivity. ""I don't know of any bad treatment to any other foreign hostages coming from him specifically, but I witnessed him torturing local prisoners,"" Henin told reporters. Nemmouche is currently in Belgium, having been extradited from France in July. He awaits prosecution in the fatal shooting of four people at the Jewish Museum in Brussels in May. Henin's accusation against Nemmouche first surfaced in a piece published Saturday in Le Point. Le Point, Henin's employer, said it had not planned to go public with Henin's information because they worried that doing so could jeopardize the safety of about 20 Western hostages still held by ISIS in Syria. But a report Saturday by French newspaper Le Monde that made public Nemmouche's alleged involvement in hostage-taking forced its hand. French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told reporters in Montpellier on Saturday that French officials believe Nemmouche ""could have been the jailer of hostages, including our hostages."" CNN has not been able independently to verify the allegations. An attorney for Nemmouche, Apolin Pepiezep, declined to comment when contacted by CNN. But he told France-based BFM-TV that he thinks the journalist is confusing his client with someone else. Pepiezep confirmed his client was questioned by French authorities this summer, but was not asked about that period in Syria. Portrayal of lost, perverse young man . Le Monde reports that the French internal security directorate, the DGSI, passed information to the counterterrorism section of the Paris prosecutor's office on Nemmouche's suspected role based on testimony from former hostages. The witness accounts vary, the newspaper reports, with some saying it was ""possible"" Nemmouche was one of the captors, while others were more certain. According to certain witnesses, Le Monde says, Nemmouche was only a lowly member of ISIS tasked with guarding the Western hostages -- but he showed great brutality and committed serious abuses. The account given by Henin -- one of four French hostages released in April -- to Le Point appears to bear out that characterization. It paints a picture of Nemmouche as an egotist and storyteller, a lost, perverse young man who sees jihad as a route to the notoriety he craves. He allegedly guarded Western hostages then held in a former hospital in Aleppo, Syria, that had been transformed into a prison. Henin says he was his captor between July and December of last year. ""When Nemmouche was not singing, he would torture,"" Henin is quoted as saying. He alleges Nemmouche was part of a small group of French jihadists who would terrorize about 50 Syrian prisoners held in the neighboring cells. ""Every evening, the blows would start to rain down in the room where I myself had been interrogated,"" he recalls. ""The torture lasted all night, until the dawn prayer. The screams of the prisoners were sometimes met by yelps in French."" Henin's full account of his experiences in captivity is due to be published next week by Le Point. Prosecutors: Suspect found with revolver, Kalashnikov . Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, said that as soon as the freed hostages gave information to the DGSI about Nemmouche, ""it was immediately communicated to (officials) so that justice could follow its course."" He added, ""This was done in extremely discrete manner to facilitate the efficiency of the procedures in the face of a character who is extremely violent ...  and represented a danger to the safety of French people."" French prosecutors said at the time of Nemmouche's arrest that he had been found in a check on a bus entering Marseille with a checked bag containing a revolver, a Kalashnikov and a small GoPro camera like the one seen on the suspect in the museum shooting. The 29-year-old, from Roubaix in the Pas-de-Calais region of northern France, recently spent a year in Syria and is a radicalized Islamist, the chief prosecutor of Paris said at a news conference. François Molins said Nemmouche, who has a criminal history that included a five-year prison stint, was influenced by Islamist teachings while in prison and left for Syria three weeks after being released in September 2012. Also found in the bag, according to Molins, was ""a white cloth with words written with a marker, mentioning in Arabic the Islamic State in Iraq and Levant,"" as ISIS is also known. Foley 'had to endure more' Henin told CNN last month that he and Foley had been mistreated at times by their captors while held together. ""Foley especially had to endure more because he was American,"" he said. ""He was missing his family and would talk often about them."" Foley's killing was followed days later by another video showing the beheading of another American journalist held by ISIS, Steven Sotloff. A threat was made at the end of the video to a British hostage in the group's hands.

"Los Angeles (CNN)Harris Wittels, a comedian and executive producer of the NBC show ""Parks and Recreation,"" has died of a possible overdose, police said Thursday. He was 30. Wittels was found at his home by his assistant, and police believe he may have died from an overdose, Los Angeles Police Department Officer Nuria Venegas told CNN. The coroner's office will be conducting an autopsy. Wittels produced, wrote and occasionally appeared in episodes of ""Parks and Recreation,"" a comedy following the exploits of a parks department employee on her one-woman mission to put her small Indiana town on the map. The show, starring Amy Poehler, is in its seventh and final season. The series finale airs next week. Wittels would sometimes appear on ""Parks and Recreation"" as Harris, an inept and clueless employee with the city's animal-control department. He was also a comic force on Twitter, where he is widely credited with coining the popular term ""humblebrag."" Under the Twitter handle @humblebrag, he retweeted celebrity posts that exemplified the term, which means bragging under a veneer of false modesty. In 2012, he turned the word into a book, ""Humblebrag: The Art of False Modesty."" Fellow comedians paid tribute to him on social media Thursday, including Sarah Silverman, whose show he worked on previously. ""He was my baby,"" she said in one Tweet. Billy Eichner, who appears on ""Parks and Recreation,"" described Wittels as ""an incredibly funny person who has left us way too soon."" Wittels, who was a frequent guest on comedy podcasts, spoke openly in his work about his drug use, cultivating a ""druggy"" comedic persona. In one episode of his podcast ""Analyze Phish,"" in which he explored his love of the band Phish, he and fellow comedians recorded themselves taking drugs as they attended one of the group's shows at the Hollywood Bowl. But in recent podcast appearances, he revealed that he had been trying to beat a serious drug addiction and had gone to rehab after he started using heroin. He also spoke about how his drug use had affected his work at ""Parks and Recreation."" Representatives of NBC Universal declined Thursday evening to comment on his death. Wittels also worked on the shows ""Eastbound & Down"" and ""Secret Girlfriend."" People we've lost in 2015 . CNN's Artemis Moshtaghian reported from Los Angeles, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.

"The deaths of six U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan are being tied, directly or indirectly, to the search for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl after he went missing and was captured by the Taliban in 2009, former unit members allege. The former soldiers' controversial accusations come days after Bergdahl was released after almost five years of enemy captivity. A U.S. official told CNN that Pentagon and Army officials have looked at the claims, and ""right now there is no evidence to back that up."" Asked about the debate, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters Wednesday that he did not know of specific circumstances or details of soldiers allegedly dying as a result of the efforts to find Bergdahl. It is also ""unfair"" to Bergdahl and his family to presume anything about his motivations for leaving the base, Hagel said. He stressed that the Army would conduct a review of the case. Former Army Sgt. Evan Buetow, Bergdahl's former team leader, elaborated on the accusations. ""I can't say for a fact and I don't know if there is really anyone who can prove that soldiers died on a directed mission to find Bergdahl. However, every mission, especially in the following two or more months -- those were directed missions,"" he told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""Everything after that, they were still missions that were in search of Bergdahl."" Here's a look at those six fallen soldiers. 2nd Lt. Darryn Deen Andrews . Andrews was killed in September 2009 when enemy forces attacked his vehicle with a roadside bomb and a rocket-propelled grenade in the Yahya Khel district of Paktika province, Afghanistan. The Dallas, Texas, native was 34. Andrews' mother, who still wears her son's ID tags, spoke to KHOU this week. The CNN affiliate reported Andrews died using his body to shield two other soldiers from a blast. Sondra Andrews feels her son was killed trying to save a ""traitor."" ""My son's life was worth more than that,"" she told KHOU. Staff Sgt. Clayton Patrick Bowen . Staff Sgt. Clayton Patrick Bowen was a 12-year Army veteran who had served as a drill sergeant and shooting instructor before being shipped out to Afghanistan in February 2009, according to a U.S. Army account of his service. The 29-year-old San Antonio, Texas, man was traveling to provide security for Afghanistan's presidential elections when his vehicle hit a roadside bomb on August 18, 2009, according to the Army account. He and another soldier, Pfc. Morris Lewis Walker, died. Bowen, who joined the Army straight out of high school, served as a member of the 82nd Airborne Division's All-American Chorus before deploying to Afghanistan with the 501st Infantry Regiment. He also was featured as the cover model for a book on how to survive basic combat training, the Army account quoted his mother, Reesa Doebbler, as saying. ""Clay had a sense of humor second to none and lit up a room when he walked in,"" Doebbler said in a 2010 CNN iReport. Pfc. Morris Lewis Walker . Walker died at age 23 when a roadside bomb exploded as he traveled through Afghanistan's Dila district. He died alongside Staff Sgt. Bowen on a mission to provide security for Afghanistan's presidential elections, according to the Army. Walker joined the Army in 2008 after attending the University of North Carolina, where he played on the basketball team, according to a UNC memorial web page. ""If you got to spend time with Mo Walker, you remembered it,"" the student newspaper, The Daily Tar Heel, quoted former student Sam Rosenthal as saying. ""He had a charisma and a warmth that just rubbed off and also a pride and a sense about himself. I had never met anybody with so much confidence and even borderline arrogance that never rubbed people the wrong way."" Staff Sgt. Kurt Robert Curtiss . Curtiss joined the Army the day after the 9/11 attack, according to CNN affiliate KSL. He was shot to death during a firefight in which his unit was supporting Afghan security forces in Paktika province on August 26, 2009. The Murray, Utah, man died during what the Army called a clearing operation at a hospital at a medical clinic in Sar Hawza. He was a well-regarded squad leader whose leadership style engendered fierce loyalty in at least one soldier -- the squad member who faced an onslaught of enemy fire in an effort to rescue him, the Army said in a 2009 article about two soldiers awarded the Silver Star for actions during the firefight. ""When I first got here, he showed me everything,"" the Army piece quoted one of those soldiers, Spec. Robert Parson, as saying. ""Just small things that only a veteran would know."" He left behind a wife, two small children, and a humorous reputation, his mother, Ruth Serrano, told KSL. ""He was quite the joker,"" she said. ""He could cheer up anybody."" Pfc. Matthew Michael Martinek . Martinek died September 11, 2009, at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Landstuhl, Germany, of injuries suffered from an attack about a week earlier in Afghanistan. Enemy forces attacked his vehicle with a roadside bomb, a rocket-propelled grenade and small-arms fire in Paktika province. His mother spoke to CNN affiliate KTUU, praising her son's sacrifice. Martinek was sent to Afghanistan during the first quarter of 2009, the station said. ""What we hope will not be lost on the American people is the true heroism of the soldiers who risked their safety to relentlessly attempt to rescue Bowe,"" said Cheryl Brandes.  ""One of those brave men was our son and brother Matthew Martinek."" Martinek, 20, was a native of DeKalb, Illinois. Staff Sgt. Michael Chance Murphrey . Murphrey was killed in September 2009 when forces attacked his unit with a roadside bomb in Paktika province. A native of Snyder, Texas, he was 25. According to an online obituary, Murphrey decided he wanted to be an Army paratrooper when his family took him skydiving on his 17th birthday. He loved to hunt, hike, camp and fish. Murphrey was survived by his wife and two young children, a son and daughter. EXPLORE: War Casualties Memorial . Obama: I don't apologize for Bergdahl swap .

"In an exodus of almost biblical proportions, thousands trudge across a river to escape killers belonging to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. Entire families carry nothing but the clothes on their backs. Some are barefoot. Jamal Jamir, a 23-year-old university student from Sinjar, told CNN his family fled to the barren and windswept Mount Sinjar more than a week ago after ISIS captured their town. The group, which calls itself the Islamic State, has been on a rampage, killing members of various minorities, including Yazidis. Jamir said after ISIS arrived in his town, Arab neighbors of his turned on the minorities and helped ISIS kill. ""They join them, and actually they kill us."" ""People you know?"" CNN asked. ""Yes,"" he responded. ""People -- our neighbors!"" Jamir's family was among tens of thousands who flocked to the mountain and desperately waited for airdrops of food and water. His family escaped to Mount Sinjar on foot and made a marathon 15-hour journey to Syria. After traveling northeast along the border, many families have been crossing a bridge in Faysh Khabur, back into Kurdish-controlled Iraq. Jamir said two of his young brothers didn't make it. ""What we do?"" he said. ""Not enough water and dusty. ... They died. ""We are poor people. We don't have any problem with anybody. We need someone (to) help us."" The Kurdish peshmerga and Iraqi air force have orchestrated helicopter flights to bring necessities to the mountain and lift some people out.  One flight crashed Tuesday, killing the pilot and injuring some others on board. Now, the United States is considering a possible air evacuation, a U.S. official said Wednesday. No decision has yet been made. An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 people remain on Mount Sinjar, according to Fuad Hussein, chief of staff of the Kurdistan Regional Government.  There are only broad figures because of the expanse of the area, he said.  Some previous estimates have been substantially higher. A senior official in Irbil, Iraq, speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity, gave an estimate similar to Hussein's, and added that some endangered Yazidis have not made it to the mountain. ""A few thousand"" are moving in the direction of Mount Sinjar from their villages, the official said. ISIS has also captured part of Syria, in its continuing effort to establish what it calls an Islamic caliphate.  Activists said Wednesday the group has overtaken villages near the northern city of Aleppo following violent clashes with rival Islamist groups. While U.S. airstrikes have helped the fight against ISIS in Iraq, the United States has not taken such action over ISIS-controlled areas in Syria. An uncertain future . Descendants of Kurds and followers of an ancient pre-Islamic religion, Yazidis are one of Iraq's smallest minorities. They have faced persecution for centuries and have a strong sense of community. When the refugees crossed a river and stepped into Syria, their suffering did not end. Relief workers provided two plates of chicken to a family of 12. People slept in the open, perhaps using scraps of cardboard for a bed. Many were too sick and exhausted to walk any farther. It's unclear what lies ahead for those who managed to escape ISIS and Mount Sinjar. Some aid groups have teams helping, and the United States is working to help Iraqi leaders organize humanitarian relief. But for now, some Yazidis tell CNN as they re-enter Iraqi territory, they play plan to camp out by the river. ISIS executes civilians who don't adhere to its version of Sunni Islam.  The group celebrates its own savagery, hoisting severed heads on poles and posting numerous videos online. During one of the airdrops on the mountain, a CNN crew observed as the crewmen tossed food and water to the ground. Then the helicopter landed and was rushed by Yazidis seeking to escape. In a chaotic scene, some of the adults pushed their children on board, and some climbed on themselves. When the helicopter finally took off, the refugees wept out of relief. At the refugee camp near the Iraqi-Syrian border, some people are finding relatives they've not seen for years. Jamir, for instance, reunited with a missing cousin. ""We lost each other!"" he said. ""We lost each other!  Thank God, we arrived!"" In Israel, a desperate Yazidi father . Khairy al-Shingari is among the many Yazidis around the world with family members who fled to Mount Sinjar. He made it into Israel with his six-month old son who needed life-saving heart surgery -- just days before ISIS overran his village, where his wife and four other children were left behind. ""There were hundreds of young men and children.  Like this, they cut off their heads.  And they scream 'God is great?'  What kind of human beings are they?  And they describe us as infidels?"" Al-Shingari told his family to flee to the mountains, where ISIS' vehicles can't reach.  ""They stayed seven days.  There was no water, food, no medicine.  They had to come down from the mountains, risking their lives."" Now, he got word that his wife and kids survived, making it into the Kurdish region.  And his baby boy is recovering well at a Tel Aviv hospital. But others are learning the worst. In the U.S., Yazidis fear for loved ones . Nawaf Suliaman is one of hundreds of Yazidis living in Lincoln, Nebraska, in the central United States.  He learned that four relatives, all of them children, died of dehydration while on the hillside. And his sisters are being held by ISIS -- forced to convert to Islam or die. Faysal Shaqooli says his sister is being held as well. ""The terrible things she saw with her own eyes,"" he says.  ""One pregnant woman refused. They cut her belly."" His sister has a phone which she hides from her captors, he says. When President Barack Obama announced targeted strikes against ISIS targets, ""there was hugs and cries everywhere,"" says Laila Khoudeida, another member of the Yazidi community in Nebraska. But the worries continue.  ""Many of us are sleep-deprived.  We cannot eat,"" she says. Sometimes when his sister has called, Shaqooli says, he didn't answer. ""I didn't know what to say -- what to tell her.""","Officials estimate 10,000-20,000 Yazidis on Mount Sinjar .

"South Korean forensics officials say they are sure the body found in a plum orchard last month is Yoo Byung Eun, a billionaire fugitive who was wanted in connection to the fatal Sewol ferry crash that claimed nearly 300 lives. But the country's forensics service said there was no way to determine the cause of death of Yoo, 73, because of the decomposed state of the body. Officials said that fingerprint, dental and DNA evidence confirmed his identity. According to various tests conducted, Yoo was not poisoned or suffocated. They found no trace of poison or alcohol, said Lee Han-Young, head of the Central Legal Medical Center. There were no signs of external force that may have caused death, he added. Yoo had been wanted by South Korean authorities, as prosecutors believed he and his sons controlled the shipping company that operated the Sewol ferry that sank on April 16. Yoo's representatives denied this allegation. His supporters claimed that Yoo had been made into a scapegoat for the ferry tragedy. The sinking killed 294 people on board, including hundreds of high school students who were on a field trip. More than 100 days after the incident, divers are still searching for bodies. Ten people remain missing. Yoo was a religious figure of the Evangelical Baptist Church, which was founded by his father-in-law.  A spokesman for the group confirmed Yoo's death on Friday. It was still unclear when Yoo died. South Korean authorities had been under scrutiny for their inability to find the elusive billionaire despite a massive manhunt, involving 8,000 officers, in the weeks following the incident. Suggestions that police bungled the investigation prompted officers to hold Friday's press conference. The identification process took 40 days, after the body was found on June 12. Korean authorities performed two autopsies and the test results matched, Lee said. Yoo's body can now be turned over to his family, but the whereabouts of most of his children are not known. Yoo's wife, Kwon Yun-Ja, is under arrest in South Korea.","South Korean forensics: Body found in June is Yoo Byung Eun .

"(CNN)  -- A study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics indicates about 1 percent of children ages 3 to 17 have autism or a related disorder, an increase over previous estimates. Children at the Marcus Autism Center in Atlanta, Georgia, receive instruction on March 5, 2009. ""This is a significant issue that needs immediate attention,"" Dr. Ileana Arias, deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. ""A concerted effort and substantial national response is warranted."" The study used data from the federal government's 2007 national survey of children's health. The survey of parents was conducted by the Health Resources and Services Administration, and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The results are based on a national telephone survey of more than 78,000 parents of children ages 3 to 17.iReport.com: How has autism affected your family? In the study, parents were asked whether a health care provider had ever told them their child had an autism spectrum disorder. ASD is a group of brain disorders comprising autism and two less severe disorders: Asperger's disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. Children with the disorder show impairment in social interaction and in their ability to communicate. They often display repetitive behavior.  Watch families discuss autism » . The investigators also asked a follow-up question: Were the children considered to have ASD now? Nearly 40 percent of the parents and guardians said no. That finding led the authors to question whether some of the children originally diagnosed as having ASD may have been improperly diagnosed, since the disorders are not considered curable. But Kogan said the two surveys cannot be compared because the earlier investigators did not ask the follow-up question about whether the children were still considered to have the disorder. Still, based on the findings, lead author Dr. Michael D. Kogan of HRSA's maternal and child health bureau estimated the prevalence of ASD among U.S. children ages 3 to 17 at 110 per 10,000 -- slightly more than 1 percent. Boys were four times as likely as girls to have ASD, and non-Hispanic black and multiracial children were less likely than non-Hispanic white children. He estimated that 673,000 children have ASD in the United States. Monday's findings of nearly 1 in 100 appear to indicate an increase from the average of 1 in 150 that was reported in 2003, the researchers said. The researchers urged caution in interpreting the change, noting that an increase in diagnoses does not necessarily mean that more children have the disorder. It could simply reflect a heightened awareness of the disorder. ""We don't know whether the change in the number over time is a result of the change in the actual condition, in the actual number of conditions or in part due to the fact that the condition is being recognized differently,"" Arias said. She said that preliminary results from a separate, CDC-funded study she is working on also indicate that about 1 percent of children in the United States are affected by ASD. That study is to be published later this year, she said. ""This is a behavioral diagnosis, and it's difficult to make, and it's difficult to make at young ages,"" said Dr. Peter van Dyck, HRSA's associate administrator for maternal and child health. Half of the cases were considered mild by their parents, the study reported. The results underscore the importance of creating policies that will result in early identification and intervention, the officials said. The reports raise ""a lot of questions about how we are preparing in terms of housing, employment, social support -- all the issues that many of these people are going to need,"" said Dr. Tom Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health. ""It also raises questions about how well we're prepared in the educational system to provide for the special needs of many of these kids."" Insel said the federal government is beefing up the resources it is mobilizing to address autism and related disorders, with $85 million being appropriated by the National Institutes of Health and $48 million for next year by the HRSA.","Study indicates about 1% of children 3 to 17 have autism or related disorder .

"An American man died last weekend in Syria while fighting for ISIS, the latest evidence of the reach of a terror group that's become increasingly powerful and feared in the eyes of Americans. Douglas McAuthur McCain, 33, died in a battle between rival extremist groups in the suburbs of Aleppo, Syria's once-bustling commercial capital and largest city, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group that monitors the conflict. The man's uncle, Ken McCain, said that his nephew had gone to fight as a jihadi and that the U.S. State Department told the family Monday about the death. Like U.S. officials, the group characterized McCain as an ISIS fighter and said he was killed battling al-Nusra Front, an al Qaeda-linked organization that the U.S. government has blacklisted as a foreign terror organization. McCain was not the first American to fight alongside militants in Syria. Attorney General Eric Holder estimated this summer that there are 7,000 foreign fighters in the war-ravaged Middle Eastern nation. More than 100 Americans are among those who have tried to join various militant groups in Syria, U.S. officials say.  While some are aligned with ISIS, the fighters shift allegiance and it's difficult to pin down a specific number, officials say. U.S.: Jihadi in suicide bombing video grew up in Florida . Nor was McCain the first of these American militants to die in Syria. Islamists touted the role of a 22-year-old man -- identified by State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki as Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, who grew up and went to school in Florida -- in a northern Syria suicide bombing conducted in coordination with al-Nusra Front. Yet McCain's death takes on added significance, perhaps urgency, given that he's believed to be the first American killed while fighting with ISIS. Until now, Washington largely has limited its involvement in Syria to diplomatic efforts and supporting ""moderate opposition,"" as described by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey and others, that is fighting to unseat Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. That's the same goal as ISIS, which aims to rule a caliphate, known as the Islamic State, spanning Iraq and Syria. Even so, the United States initiated airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq this month and signaled that it might next go after the group inside Syria. And it has begun gathering intelligence on ISIS in Syria, potentially ahead of more airstrikes there. ISIS has threatened to kill more Americans if the U.S. continues to go after it. But the fact McCain was among its ranks adds another fear: That the group includes other Americans who, rather than dying on the battlefield, might inflict harm stateside. ""There's real concern that they could take what they've learned ... come back home and conduct terror attacks,"" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told CNN. ""So I think (McCain) is a stark reminder of the inside threat that foreign fighters (in ISIS) can pose."" Official: Obama weighing options against ISIS in Syria . Who was Douglas McCain? Little was immediately known publicly about McCain's life, beyond how it ended. He attended San Diego City College, though its spokesman Jack Beresford would not say when McCain attended, for how long or for what purpose. Several years ago, according to his uncle, McCain converted from Christianity to Islam -- the first step on his journey to Syria. The family wasn't alarmed by his conversion, but his Facebook posts sympathetic to ISIS got their attention. When they last heard from him several months ago, McCain said he was traveling to Turkey, according to his uncle. The fact that McCain became a jihadi left his family ""devastated"" and ""just as surprised as the country,"" said Ken McCain, who lives in Minnesota. He described the nephew he knew as ""a good person, loved his family, loved his mother, loved his faith"" -- the latter being a reference to the Christianity he practiced before his conversion. U.S. counterterrorism investigators had been looking into McCain's activities for some time before his death, one U.S. official said. He was on a list of Americans who are believed to have joined militant groups and who would be stopped and subjected to additional scrutiny if he traveled, according to the official. Retired U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, who had top roles in the State and Defense Departments in President George W. Bush's administration, said he expects more stories like McCain's. ""The ability to travel into these countries demonstrates how porous the borders are,"" Kimmitt said. ""I think we need to understand that there's going to be more of this rather than less of this."" California man arrested, wanted to join ISIS . Fears over Westerners in terror groups . Syria's civil war has been brewing for three years. In the absence of a unified rebel front, many groups -- some moderate, some  more secular, some extremist -- have tried to fill the void. Much of the time, they've battled al-Assad's forces, though there has also been infighting among them. Among these rebel groups, one has emerged recently in the public's consciousness: ISIS. That's as much due to its brazenness and viciousness as to its success. The general command for al Qaeda -- itself responsible for the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks -- went so far as to disown ISIS and blame it for ""the enormity of the disaster that afflicted the Jihad in Syria."" Who is ISIS? Yet the group has thrived. It has taken more and more territory in Iraq and Syria, sometimes overrunning government forces while terrorizing civilians. ISIS's stature grew even more internationally with the recent beheading of American journalist James Foley, a killing it videotaped and then put online. ""They are beyond just a terrorist group,"" Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said last week. ""They marry ideology, a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess. ""This is beyond anything we have seen, and we must prepare for everything."" These preparations include tracking Westerners like McCain. In addition to whatever they might do against allies and civilians in the Middle East, U.S. officials worry that they could bring their groups' brand of terror back home. Assistant Attorney General John Carlin said last month that getting intelligence on such Americans who fight in Syria and making sure they don't bring that right back home is ""a top priority."" ""We have increased our capacity, we have increased our tracking, we have increased our coordination,"" Psaki said. ""... This is a threat that we take seriously enough to put it at the front and center of our agenda."" Man arrested after overseas trip, accused of sympathizing with ISIS .

"A proud father's boast accompanies an image the U.S. secretary of state on Tuesday called ""one of the most disturbing, stomach-turning, grotesque photographs ever displayed."" ""That's my boy,"" Khaled Sharrouf wrote on Twitter alongside a photo of his 7-year-old son using both hands to hold up a man's severed head. The photo, since removed from Twitter, was reportedly taken in Raqqa, a Syrian city in the stranglehold of Islamic State (IS) militants, where the Australian father has taken his young family to join the fight. Condemnation has been swift and on Tuesday included scathing criticism from Australia's most senior Islamic cleric, Grand Mufti Ibrahim Abu Mohamed. ""It is utterly deplorable for extremists to use Islam as a cover for their crimes and atrocities,"" Mohamed said in a statement to CNN from the Australian National Imams Council. ""Their misguided actions do not represent the overwhelming majority of Muslims who emulate the pure teachings of Islam such as justice, mercy and freedom."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the image underscored ""the degree which ISIL (now Islamic State) is so far beyond the pale with respect to any standard that we judge even terrorist groups."" ""That child should be in school; that child should be out learning about the future; that child should be playing with other kids, not holding a severed head and out in the field of combat,"" he said. Kerry spoke at a news conference with Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who also presented the image as evidence of the increasing threat of ""homegrown terrorists."" ""There are a significant number of Australian citizens who are taking part in activities in Iraq and parts of Syria: extremist activities, terrorist activities,"" Bishop said. ""Our fear is that they will return home to Australia as hardened homegrown terrorists and seek to continue their work here in Australia."" Who is Khaled Sharrouf? Born in Australia in February 1981, Sharrouf is the son of Lebanese parents who had a violent relationship with his father and spent most of his youth in and out of local courts. Details of Sharrouf's troubled teenage years were revealed in court documents from his sentencing in the New South Wales Supreme Court in 2009 on terror-related charges. According to the documents, Sharrouf was expelled from school in Year 9 for violent conduct and ""was soon drawn into bad company."" He appeared before the courts on a number of minor charges between 1995 and 1998, when he was also regularly taking amphetamines, LSD and ecstasy. The drugs were likely to have been a ""significant factor"" in the emergence of schizophrenia, the documents said. Sydney attack plot . Sharrouf worked as a laborer in the building industry for a time but survived mostly on a disability support pension until his arrest in November 2005 on terror-related charges. He was one of nine alleged terrorists detained after a series of raids on homes and businesses as part of Operation Pandanus, an investigation into plans to bring holy war to Australia. Sharrouf pleaded guilty to possessing batteries and clocks knowing that they were going to be used to make explosives for a terrorist act. However, Sharrouf's hearing was delayed after he was found to be unfit to stand trial due to mental illness. In November 2007, a court-appointed specialist said he was suffering an ""acute exacerbation of the illness schizophrenia."" He was put on medication, and in early 2009, it was deemed he had made a ""remarkable recovery."" Sharrouf was sentenced to five years and three months in prison. However, as he'd already served most of that time while awaiting trial, he was released from prison after just three weeks. 'A chance for a fresh start' During the sentencing, the court heard an affidavit from his wife, Tara Nettleton, who said she and Khaled had talked about what they wanted to do once he was released from prison. At the time, the couple had four children. ""He often tells me how sad he feels that he has missed out on so much of his children's life and that he can't wait to be able to return home so that he can have a chance to make up to his children all the time that was missed and get to know them again,"" the statement said. ""We often talk about moving out to the country and living on a farm so that we get away from everything and get the chance to have a fresh start,"" Nettleton added. It's not clear what Nettleton thinks of her husband's decision to take their children to Syria. However, her estranged father, Peter Nettleton, said he was devastated by the image of his grandson holding a head. ""I'm scared for the children,"" he told News Corp. ""What life are they going to have now?"" Was Sharrouf further radicalized in prison? Less than five years after his release from prison, it's clear that Sharrouf has not abandoned the ideology that saw him jailed. If anything, his time in prison has further radicalized him, according to Clarke Jones, an expert from the Australian National University who is writing a book on the radicalization of inmates. ""The way we incarcerate terrorists -- the labels we put on terrorists -- we tend to isolate them and segregate them. But sometimes it's better to incorporate these types of individuals with other inmates. ""If you isolate them and segregate them, it tends to give them time to think and strengthen their cause, strengthens their ideologies. So I think this time in prison made him worse,"" he said. ""If he has severe psychological conditions, he needs treatment; he's a sick individual."" It's unclear why Sharrouf has chosen to take his young family to a war zone, but Jones says that if he was doing it to win support, he's likely to have failed. ""For some reason, he thinks that getting his son to hold up a head is going to attract people to his cause. I actually think it's going to have a negative effect. I think it's going to deter some of those who might  have wanted to demonstrate their faith to a religion,"" he said.","Convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf causes outrage with image .

"(CNN)A boy with a pistol appears to execute two men who are accused of being Russian spies in a new propaganda video released by the terror ISIS group. In the video, the boy, who has been identified as Abdullah in prior ISIS videos, sports long hair and wears a black sweater and military fatigue pants. He stands behind the two men, who are kneeling, and shoots them in the back of the head in a theatrically produced video with slow motion. The boy stands over one of the bodies, fires two more times, and later raises his pistol high. CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the video, but it appears to be the first time ISIS has shown a child carrying out an execution. The video's title is ""Uncovering an Enemy Within"" and states that ""enemies thought that they could dispatch spies and agents to plot against the Islamic State, but Allah disgraced their efforts and thwarted their plans."" Everything to know about the rise of ISIS . The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria is using warfare and terror in an attempt to create an Islamic state, or caliphate, across the Sunni areas of Iraq and in Syria. ISIS has featured children as fighters before, calling them the ""cubs of the caliphate,"" a play on words referring to how jihadis are called ""lions."" ISIS has encouraged foreign fighters to bring their families and has taken over schools to indoctrinate children. In June, Human Rights Watch documented the experiences of 25 children and former child soldiers in Syria's civil war and asserted that nonstate armed groups have used children as young as 15 to fight in warfare and used others as young as 14 in support roles. CNN Exclusive: 13-year-old witness to ISIS beheadings . ISIS and other extreme Islamists ""have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks, including suicide bombing missions,"" the rights group said. In earlier ISIS videos, the boy named Abdullah says that he's from Kazakhstan and wants to grow up to kill ""infidels."" He appears to be Asian. ISIS has used shocking imagery of children in the past. In August, a 7-year-old Australian boy held a man's severed head reportedly in the ISIS-held town of Raqqa, Syria. The photo was posted on Twitter by his Australian father, Khaled Sharrouf, who wrote ""that's my boy."" The international community condemned the incident and photograph. 2014: Child fighter tormented by ISIS . The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Russians did infiltrate Syria in late December and made up the majority of 19 men who went to the ISIS-held area of al-Ra'i. The Observatory is an activist group opposing the Syrian government, embroiled in a civil war where ISIS has established strongholds. The video shows the two men being questioned by someone off-screen, and they identify themselves as Mamayev Jambulat Yesenjanovich, 38, who was born near Jambul, Kazakhstan, and Ashimov Sergey Nikolayavich, 30. Both men say they are informants for the Russian intelligence service. In the questioning of the 38-year-old man, the video states that service as ""FSB,"" or Russian's Federal Security Service. The Russian state security organization could not be immediately reached for comment Wednesday. The Russian state news agency RIA reported that the FSB and the Russian embassy in Syria refused to comment on the situation. On January 4, Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of the Chechen Republic, told the news agency Interfax that Russia has an intelligence network within ISIS. When asked whether there was an ISIS terrorism threat in Chechnya, Kadyrov stated: ""There is no threat. We are scaring ourselves with ISIS. Within the ranks of hordes of terrorists, we have a good intelligence network. This allows us to track the movement of those who are of interest to us. Moreover, it allows us to send those who, even as a joke, direct the barrel towards Russia on an eternal trip with a one-way ticket."" The anatomy of ISIS: How it is run .

"A California school that stopped students from wearing American flag T-shirts on Cinco de Mayo didn't violate their constitutional rights, an appeals court ruled Thursday. The school's approach, according to the appeals court, kept students safe in a climate of racial tension. ""The controversy and tension remained,"" a panel of judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said in their opinion, ""but the school's actions presciently avoided an altercation."" School officials were worried about violence and disruption of school activities ""and their response was tailored to the circumstance,"" the opinion said. The case dates back to May 5, 2010, when the principal of Live Oak High School in Morgan Hill, California, asked a group of students wearing American flag T-shirts to turn their shirts inside out or take them off. The students at the Northern California school refused, according to the appeals court's summary of the case, and later brought a civil rights suit against the school and two administrators, arguing that their rights to freedom of expression, equal protection and due process had been violated. Judges said the civil rights case forced them to weigh the difficult question of what takes precedence: students' free speech rights or school safety concerns? According to court documents, the incident occurred amid ""ongoing racial tension and gang violence within the school, and after a near-violent altercation had erupted during the prior Cinco de Mayo over the display of an American flag."" The previous year, court documents said, a group of students carrying a Mexican flag had clashed with students who hung an American flag from a tree and chanted ""USA"" on Cinco de Mayo, a holiday marking a famous Mexican military battle that is often celebrated in the United States. In 2010, the appeals court said, ""threats issued in the aftermath of the incident were so real that the parents of the students involved in the suit kept them home from school two days later."" CNN first learned of the court's ruling on Twitter.","An appeals court says the Northern California school's decision kept students safe .

"A video released by ISIS shows the beheading of U.S. journalist James Foley and threatens the life of another American if President Barack Obama doesn't end military operations in Iraq. In the video posted Tuesday on YouTube, Foley is seen kneeling next to a man dressed in black. Foley reads a message, presumably scripted by his captors, that his ""real killer'' is America. ""I wish I had more time. I wish I could have the hope for freedom to see my family once again,"" he can be heard saying in the video. He is then shown being beheaded. ""We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by (ISIS),"" National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said. ""The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available."" Obama was briefed about the video, and ""he will continue to receive regular updates,"" White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. ISIS has carried out executions, including beheadings, as part of its effort to establish an Islamic caliphate that stretches from Syria into Iraq. In many cases, ISIS -- which refers to itself as the Islamic State -- has videotaped the executions and posted them online. CNN is not airing the video. What to know about ISIS . 'They are innocents' Foley disappeared on November 22, 2012, in northwest Syria, near the border with Turkey. He was reportedly forced into a vehicle by gunmen; he was not heard from again. At the time of his disappearance, he was working for the U.S.-based online news outlet GlobalPost. On Tuesday, Foley's mother, Diane, took to social media with an emotional statement to praise and mourn her son. ""We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people,"" she said in a post on the Free James Foley Facebook page. ""We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world. ""We thank Jim for all the joy he gave us. He was an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person. Please respect our privacy in the days ahead as we mourn and cherish Jim.'' Another American in video . The video of his killing also shows another U.S. journalist. The militant in the video, who speaks English with what sounds like a British accent, says the other American's life hangs in the balance, depending on what Obama does next. U.S. Official: ISIS 'credible alternative to al Qaeda' The journalist is believed to be Steven Sotloff, who was kidnapped at the Syria-Turkey border in 2013. Sotloff is a contributor to Time and Foreign Policy magazines. The Committee to Protect Journalists estimates there are about 20 journalists missing in Syria, many of them held by ISIS. Among them is American Austin Tice, a freelance journalist who was contributing articles to The Washington Post. Tice disappeared in Syria in August 2012. There has been no word of from him since his abduction. 'We ask for your prayers' As a freelancer, Foley picked up work for a number of major media outlets, including Agence France-Presse and GlobalPost. ""On behalf of John and Diane Foley, and also GlobalPost, we deeply appreciate all of the messages of sympathy and support that have poured in since the news of Jim's possible execution first broke,"" Philip Balboni, GlobalPost CEO and co-founder, said in a published statement, referring to James Foley's parents. ""We have been informed that the FBI is in the process of evaluating the video posted by the Islamic State to determine if it is authentic. Until we have that determination, we will not be in a position to make any further statement. We ask for your prayers for Jim and his family."" Foley had previously been taken captive in Libya. He was detained there in April 2011 along with three other reporters and released six weeks later. Afterward, he said that what saddened him most was knowing that he was causing his family to worry. Who is the ISIS? Fair, curious and popular . Foley grew up in New Hampshire and graduated from Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism in 2008. Like some other young journalists working after the September 11 terror attacks, Foley was drawn to Iraq, Afghanistan and other areas of conflict. Friends described Foley as fair, curious and impressively even-tempered. ""Everybody, everywhere, takes a liking to Jim as soon as they meet him,"" journalist Clare Morgana Gillis wrote in a blog post about him in May 2013, six months after he disappeared in Syria. ""Men like him for his good humor and tendency to address everyone as 'bro' or 'homie' or 'dude' after the first handshake. Women like him for his broad smile, broad shoulders, and because, well, women just like him."" 'Our hearts are broken' People in Foley's hometown of Rochester, New Hampshire, expressed shock and sadness at the news. ""This is a tragedy which is beyond imagining. There are no words to describe this kind of inhumanity,"" the Rev. Paul Gousse of the Holy Rosary Church told CNN affiliate WMUR. ""You just feel sad,"" Sully Harte, a neighbor, told the local broadcaster. ""You just hope the family can grieve and deal with it because it's one of those things that you can't control at all."" Sen. Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire, said in a statement that ""our hearts are broken for the Foley family."" ""James was an innocent civilian who was bravely performing his job as a journalist,"" Ayotte said. ""This barbaric and heinous act shocks the conscience and highlights the truly evil nature of the terrorists we confront, who must be defeated."" Will anyone stop ISIS? Previous brutal killings of Americans . The video of Foley was released as ISIS is being targeted by American airstrikes ordered by Obama. ""I think they may have been surprised and are doing the best they can to retaliate,"" former CIA director R. James Woolsey, Jr. told CNN. Foley's killing recalled the murder of Daniel Pearl, The Wall Street Journal correspondent who was kidnapped while reporting in Pakistan in January 2002. His killing was captured on video and posted on line by al Qaeda. It also harkened to the videotaped beheadings of Americans Nicholas Berg, Eugene Armstrong and Jack Hensley carried out by al Qaeda during the height of the Iraq War.

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)Boko Haram militants opened fire on northern Nigerian villages, leaving bodies scattered everywhere and as many as 2,000 people feared dead. ""The attack on Baga and surrounding towns looks as if it could be Boko Haram's deadliest act,"" Amnesty International said in a statement. Islamist militants sprayed bullets as they stormed in last weekend in trucks and armored vehicles, local authorities said Friday. When they arrived, they unloaded motorcycles and pursued residents who fled into the bush, firing indiscriminately, said Baba Abba Hassan, a local district head. Local officials reported death tolls ranging from hundreds to as many as 2,000 people. ""Dead bodies litter the bushes in the area and it is still no‎t safe to go and pick them (up) for burial,"" said Musa Bukar, the chairman of the local government where Baga is located. ""Some people who hid in their homes were burned alive."" Raid lasted for days . During the raid that started January 3, hundreds of gunmen seized the town of Baga and neighboring villages, as well as a multinational military base. Attacks started at dawn and continued throughout last weekend, according to residents. Though local officials gave conflicting death tolls, they agreed on the massive number of fatalities. More than 2,000 people were killed in attacks on 16 villages, Bukar said. He could not explain how he arrived at that toll. But the local district head said hundreds of people had been killed, not thousands. The actual toll will be known after a headcount of households is complete, Hassan said. An offensive is underway to reclaim the areas from the militants, according to Mike Omeri, a government spokesman. Tens of thousands displaced . At least 30,000 people were displaced, authorities said. About 20,000 of the displaced camped in Maiduguri city, the capital of Borno state. Authorities are making arrangements to transport the 10,000 others from Monguno town, 60 kilometers (36 miles) from Baga. Some residents fled into neighboring Cameroon and Chad. ""If reports that the town was largely razed to the ground and that hundreds or even as many as 2,000 civilians were killed are true, this marks a disturbing and bloody escalation of Boko Haram's ongoing onslaught against the civilian population,"" Amnesty International's Daniel Eyre said. Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. It has also kidnapped students, including more than 200 schoolgirls who were abducted in April and remain missing. The Islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. The United States condemned the attacks, saying the group ""shows no regard"" for human life. ""All those responsible for these recurring terrorist attacks must be held accountable,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. Threats against Cameroon . In neighboring Cameroon, President Paul Biya urged the international community to help battle the terror group. His call came after the leader of the terrorist group threatened him in a YouTube video. ""Oh Paul Biya, if you don't stop this, your evil plot, you will taste what has befallen Nigeria. Your troops cannot do anything to us,"" Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau said in the video released this week. The threat against the President came after Cameroonian soldiers killed dozens of Boko Haram fighters this month. Biya told the international community that a global response is required to combat the terror group. CNN's Faith Karimi wrote and reported from Atlanta, and Aminu Abubakar reported from Kano. CNN's Steve Almasy and Ngala Killian Chimtom contributed to this report.","Deaths number in the hundreds, one official says; another says it is 2,000 .

"A 17-year-old male was charged Saturday as an adult with aggravated assault and other charges over a shooting the previous day at a Philadelphia high school, police said. The suspect, accompanied by lawyer, was taken into custody about 1 p.m. ET Saturday. ""The male that turned himself in ... has been deemed the shooter based on the investigation thus far,"" said Philadelphia police Lt. John Stanford. Later Saturday, the suspect -- whom Stanford identified as Raisheem Rochwell -- was arraigned as an adult. He faces aggravated assault, violation of Pennsylvania's Uniform Firearms Act, recklessly endangering another person, having a weapon on school property ""and other related charges,"" according to the police spokesman. Rochwell's bail was set at $500,000, added Stanford. Detective Don Suchinsky said Saturday that a second male held for questioning was released to his mother. Another juvenile was questioned and released Friday. All this stems from a shooting that occurred about 3:30 p.m. Friday in the gymnasium at Delaware Valley Charter High School. The shooter was in the school gym with about seven other students, city police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said. Some were playing basketball and others standing in a corner when he pulled a gun and fired. The victims were an 18-year-old female and 17-year-old male, police said. She was struck in the rear of the left arm, with the bullet perforating her bicep and striking the boy in the shoulder. They were taken to a local hospital, police said, and their wounds are not life-threatening. The incident was at least the second shooting at or near a school this week in the Olney neighborhood. Lockdown, search . The school went into lockdown as law enforcement officers searched students and let them out of the school, said Stanford. They determined that it wasn't an active shooter incident. The shooter had left the scene. Not long after the lockdown, Philadelphia police posted a message on Twitter, saying they had a suspect in custody. They later released the 15-year-old male, who was ""completely cleared by investigators,"" Stanford said. On Saturday, police said school security officials provided inaccurate information about the teen who was cleared and released. What exactly happened in the gym remains unclear. ""We don't know the motives,"" Ramsey said, ""don't know if it was an accident, don't know if it was intentional."" Many unknowns . Surveillance video captured the incident, Stanford said. But police do not know how many shots were fired, Ramsey said. No shell was found at the scene. Police searched for the weapon late Friday in trash cans, along railroad tracks and other spots around a nearby major urban transit station, transit spokesman Andrew Busch said. Commissioner Ramsey seemed frustrated about school shootings reported across America. ""People send their kids to school; they shouldn't have to pick them up at the hospital,"" he said. ""These kind of things just absolutely should not happen."" 2 students shot in New Mexico middle school .

"(CNN)A murder weapon isn't the only thing missing as prosecutors try to convince jurors that former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez orchestrated the  execution of Odin Lloyd. The shoes prosecutors say Hernandez was wearing at the industrial park where Lloyd was killed also have seemingly vanished into thin air. ""The shoes and footprints caused by the shoes (are) a big deal,"" says CNN legal analyst Paul Callan, a former homicide prosecutor. A big deal because connecting an athletic shoe impression found near Lloyd's body to Hernandez could help prove he directly participated in Lloyd's death. Lloyd, 27, was shot once in the back and six times in the front in June 2013 -- the final two bullets fired as he lay face up, according to the medical examiner. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty. Aaron Hernandez's downward spiral . The sneakers prosecutors believe Hernandez wore the night of Lloyd's death were within the grasp of investigators who visited the ex-football star's home, but it appears no one knew it at the time. Investigators photographed a pair of Nike Air Jordan XI Retro Low brand sneakers during one of their first searches of Hernandez's home, according to court papers, but did not take them in as evidence. When Lloyd's body was discovered, crime scene investigators singled out one of two footwear impressions early on because one didn't match the ""lugged sole"" shoes of police, nor the shoes of first responders or civilian witnesses who found Lloyd's body, according to court documents. When police began executing search warrants for weapons and clothing at Hernandez's home on June 18 and June 22, 2013, they also were looking for shoes that could match that print in the dirt, according to court files and testimony. So far, jurors have not been told that somehow three other sets of sneakers neatly lined up side by side along a bedroom wall in the basement were overlooked, and ""appeared to be in good condition,"" according to an affidavit. The basement is where Hernandez's man cave is located and is complete with bar, a screening room, a pool table with a New England Patriot's logo, and a trophy room. That affidavit dated November 14, 2014, says that after studying images and home security video and having ""consulted with Nike,"" investigators believe those three pairs of shoes are ""believed to be produced by Nike and Creative Recreation."" They are the white and black Air Jordan XI Retros, the red Creative Recreation Cesario low tops; and the brown Nike Air Jordan winterized spike sneakers allegedly worn by Hernandez, Wallace and Ortiz, respectively. Wallace and Ortiz are also charged with the murder of Lloyd. They have pleaded not guilty and are going to be tried separately. Wallace and Ortiz are seen on home security video entering the house and going into the basement after getting out of a car minutes after Lloyd was fatally shot in a nearby industrial park. Prosecutors say the cable connecting the basement security camera, labeled ""man cave,"" was unplugged after the three men went downstairs. Authorities say the ""outsole pattern,"" of the Air Jordan XI Retro Low's allegedly worn by Hernandez is ""similar to and consistent with the unidentified shoe impression... in close proximity to the body of Odin Lloyd,"" according to the affidavit. It also states the XI Retro Lows became available for public sale only three weeks before Lloyd's murder. Yet, it wasn't until almost a year and a half later, when investigators were making final trial preparations last November, that they ""noted"" the three pairs of shoes in photographs and realized they could still be at Hernandez's home, a search warrant affidavit states. In court papers, investigators said the sneakers appear to match shoe prints found at the scene where Lloyd was fatally shot. In order to look again, police asked a court to approve another search warrant. The application also points out home surveillance video showing Wallace and Ortiz leaving the home after the shooting -- wearing sandals. Trying to make the case for another search, investigators also quote a jailhouse phone call dated December 25, 2013, between Hernandez and his fiancee Shayanna Jenkins. Hernandez told Jenkins, ""You still got my, my clothes at the house and s—?"" Jenkins responded,""I really don't understand. I mean, where do you think your clothes are?...Your clothes are exactly where they're supposed to be.....I mean, you've only been gone for what, six months?"" ""Yeah,"" Hernandez said. ""You act like you're gonna be gone for like, 20 years,"" Jenkins replied. But when police searched the home again on November 24, they didn't find the shoes. Details about the missing Nike sneakers have not yet come up at trial. How might it play with the jury? ""Jurors will wonder why didn't investigators seize the shoes at the same time they seized many other pieces of evidence from Hernandez's home,"" says University of New Hampshire law professor Michael McCann, who's closely monitoring the trial. ""If jurors determine investigators and prosecutors simply made a mistake in not seizing the shoes, it could damage the jurors' confidence in the case. It's possible prosecutors could try to mollify this concern by noting that rules of evidence and pretrial discovery limit the types of evidence they can be taken from a person's home.""","Shoes prosecutors say Hernandez wore on night of Lloyd's death are missing .
Hernandez is on trial for murder of Lloyd and has pleaded not guilty .

"(CNN)Political chaos roiled oil-rich Venezuela Friday after intelligence agents in the socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro arrested the mayor of Caracas. The arrest came just days after Maduro accused the mayor of involvement in a plot to overthrow the government. Agents arrested Mayor Antonio Ledezma -- a well-known opposition politician -- on Thursday in a raid that sparked a fierce outcry from the president's political opponents. President Nicolas Maduro said the mayor will be prosecuted ""so that he answers for all of the crimes committed against the peace, security and constitution of our country."" In a televised address, Maduro said Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma was captured by order of the Attorney General's Office. A high-level Venezuelan military source with knowledge of the situation told CNN en Español the mayor was taken into custody because of his alleged involvement in a plot to overthrow the government an accusation Maduro leveled last week. Ledezma denied it, calling it the government's latest attempt to manufacture controversy and target political opponents. In 2009, Ledezma staged a hunger strike to protest the political tactics of former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. His attorney, Omar Estacio, decried his detention. Ledezma was ""virtually kidnapped,"" Estacio said, calling it ""a violation of the most fundamental principles of Venezuelan law and international law."" The mayor's office told CNN en Español that more than 150 intelligence agents participated in Thursday's raid. ""They destroyed the doors,"" his wife, Mitzy Capriles, told CNN en Español. ""There was no room for mediation. (My husband) was asking them to please stay calm and was asking what was going on. Abruptly, pushing and shoving, and without saying a word a gigantic, enormous contingent of agents, who were all over the place on the sixth-floor office where he works part of the day, took him away."" Richard Blanco, an opposition Venezuelan lawmaker whose office is also in the building, said he witnessed Ledezma's arrest. ""They pushed me as well and they pointed their guns at me,"" he said. ""They broke the metropolitan mayor's office glass doors with a sledgehammer."" Opposition leaders said Ledezma was a political prisoner unjustly held by the government. Word of his detention spread rapidly on social media after a Twitter post from the mayor's account Thursday evening said his office had been surrounded by police. About 90 minutes later, another tweet from the account, purportedly written by the mayor's wife, said he had been beaten and detained without any arrest warrant. ""I hold Maduro responsible for the life of my husband,"" the tweet said. Accusations of coup conspiracies have a long history in Venezuela. A coup briefly removed Chavez from office in 2002. In his national broadcast Thursday night, Maduro repeated accusations that his government had blocked a U.S.-backed opposition coup plot that included plans to attack the presidential palace with a military jet. ""Enough already with vampires who conspire against peace,"" he said. Maduro's accusations spurred a sharp response from the U.S. State Department, which called them ""baseless and false."" ""The United States is not promoting unrest in Venezuela nor are we attempting to undermine Venezuela's economy or its government.

"Attorneys for Texas teen Ethan Couch claimed that his ""affluenza"" meant he was blameless for driving drunk and causing a crash that left four people dead in June. Simply put, Couch, 16, claims that his condition stemmed from having wealthy, privileged parents who never set limits for him. Judge Jean Boyd sentenced him Tuesday to 10 years of probation but no jail time, saying she would work to find him a long-term treatment facility. But Eric Boyles, who lost his wife and daughter in the crash, said on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360,"" ""There are absolutely no consequences for what occurred that day. The primary message has to absolutely be that money and privilege can't buy justice in this country."" Is ""affluenza"" real? Or is it a way for coddled children and adolescents to evade consequences for their actions? Not surprisingly, ""affluenza"" does not appear in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM, the ""psychiatric Bible."" Video: Callan: Poverty in prison cures affluenza . But the term highlights the issue of parents, particularly upper-middle-class ones, who not only refuse to discipline their children but may protest the efforts of others -- school officials, law enforcement and the courts -- who attempt to do so, said Suniya Luthar, a professor of psychology at Arizona State University. ""There are families where very, very few limits are set at a time when they should be,"" she said. By age 16, she noted, it's too late: ""The horse is out of the barn."" The diagnosis for youths in such situations would be impulse control problems, said Atlanta psychologist Mary Gresham -- and impulse control problems are seen across all socioeconomic levels in families where limits aren't set. ""We don't know if the rates of poor limit-setting are higher in affluent families or not,"" Gresham said, noting that there has not been a lot of research. Luthar says she has studied wealthier families, however, and ""we've found the level of serious adjustment problems ranging from depression, anxiety, delinquency, substance abuse higher among kids of upper-middle-class families."" She says in one of her studies, her team gave youths several different scenarios, ranging from minor to serious infractions -- such as being caught for the third time with vodka at school or plagiarizing on a test -- and asked them how likely their parents would be to protest any punishment for them. ""There was definitely a subgroup of kids that said, 'My parents would object (to punishment from school officials),' "" she said. However, she points out that this is not the norm. ""It's a small group (of parents) but very vocal, aggressive, entitled. ... There is definitely a small subgroup that is powerful and way off the charts."" ""I wouldn't say there's worse parenting in affluent families and fewer limits set,"" Gresham said. ""That's not true."" But in wealthy families, Gresham said, ""kids without limits have a lot more resources to use for their impulsive behavior. They have a lot more money and a lot more access to powerful cars that are fast; to drugs and alcohol, because those things cost money. So the extra resources that you have to live out your impulse control problems really create a problem."" Both she and Luthar pointed out that affluent families also have the means to afford things like quality defense attorneys and treatment for their children. And, says Gresham, children in affluent families may not have jobs and may have more free time. Blame it on 'affluenza,' rich kid syndrome . The day of the crash, Boyles' wife, Hollie, and daughter Shelby had left their home to help Breanna Mitchell, whose SUV had a flat tire. Youth pastor Brian Jennings also stopped to help. All four died when Couch's pickup plowed into them. The vehicle also struck a parked car, which slid into another vehicle coming the opposite way. Two people riding in the bed of Couch's pickup sustained severe injuries. Earlier that day, Couch and some friends had stolen beer from a local Walmart. Three hours after the crash, Couch's blood alcohol level was 0.24, three times the legal limit for someone of legal drinking age, according to prosecutors. ""There are ways in a society that we collectively shape the behavior of our kids,"" meaning parents, school officials and law enforcement, Luthar says. ""If you find the parents are not imposing limits themselves but fighting consequences ... then obviously, the child is going to continue whatever,"" she said. ""You keep upping the ante."" And unless a child faces consequences, their actions are ""likely to mushroom."" ""It really speaks to the importance of attending to our children's behavior early on,"" she said. ""In all cases, it is the duty of us ... to step in and do the right thing. It's not just loving our kids but putting the appropriate limits"" on their behavior. Gresham says she understands why Couch's sentencing left some outraged but agrees with the judge that he should be in treatment. ""I can understand how people would be angry, if 16-year-olds from less affluent families are sentenced to juvenile detention and not treatment,"" she said. ""All teenagers who act out should actually have access to therapeutic resources,"" although not all of them do. Luthar says she doesn't like to blame children for their actions. But on ""affluenza,"" she notes: ""If you have a child who grew up in the inner city, and the parents abused crack, and (the child) was abused all along and grew up at the age of 16 and ran over four people, how likely is it the public or culture would say, 'You must understand, what the child did was a result of his upbringing'? ""It is hard to justify such vastly different approaches taken toward inner-city children versus those in affluence.""","A Texas teen claims ""affluenza"" rendered him blameless in a fatal DUI crash .
Some parents refuse to set limits, a psychologist says .
Those parents may resist efforts of others to discipline their child .
Without appropriate limits, a child's behavior will ""mushroom,"" she says ."
"(CNN)I kinda hate that there's a ""day"" for everything, these days. Friday, for example, was simultaneously Love Your Pet Day, Cherry Pie Day and Handcuff Day (apparently celebrating the 1912 patenting of the ""de facto restraint of law enforcement agencies worldwide""), according to DaysOfTheYear.com, a website I'm embarrassed to be citing. But there's one of these odd ""days"" I feel compelled to embrace. Saturday is the fourth annual World Pangolin Day. Never heard of the pangolin? It's a rare, scale-covered mammal. About the size of a house cat, the notoriously shy pangolin rolls up in a ball to protect itself, like a roly-poly. It can fend off lions in this manner, but not poachers. They just pluck these critters out of the jungle and toss them into sacks. Pangolin meat and scales are quite valuable on the black market. So much so that the pangolin is thought to be the most trafficked mammal in the world. If any creature needs the publicity a ""day"" can provide, it's the pangolin. I traveled to Vietnam and Indonesia last year to document the illegal pangolin trade for a story CNN.com readers commissioned as part of my Change the List series. I'd never heard of the pangolin when I started reporting that piece, but I've got a soft spot for these creatures now. I'll be among the hopefully hundreds or thousands of people around the world on Saturday who will do just some little thing to honor these introverted underdogs -- and to try to help protect them by bringing them a little more celebrity. I've argued the pangolin needs a PR campaign to survive, and World Pangolin Day is just the kind of effort that could help ensure their continued existence. With that in mind, here are seven ways you can celebrate with me: . There are soooooo many to choose from. Here are three of my favorites: . (A CNN.com reader made the music video above. More on him here.) (My conversation with that ""Honey Badger"" dude on his pangolin obsession.) I guess this is supposed to be kinda like the Ice Bucket Challenge? A group calling itself Pump It for Pangolins is encouraging Facebook users to post videos of themselves doing 21 crunches in honor of World Pangolin Day. You can share videos on the group's Facebook page or by tagging it #pumpit4pangolins. The goal is to raise money for pangolin conservation. I think the crunches are supposed to simulate the way the pangolin rolls up in a ball when it feels threatened. But these odd videos remind me of the way a pangolin in Vietnam ab-crushed my arm when a researcher asked me to hold the animal. ""This animal must have the abs of Pink,"" I wrote at the time. Here's the weirdest best crunch video I found in a quick scan of the site: . Donate to the WildAid campaign here . China, particularly the southeastern provinces, is thought to be the world's largest market for illegal pangolin products, Peter Knights, executive director of the nonprofit WildAid, told me in an interview this week. WildAid is planning a media campaign in China to raise awareness about the endangered pangolin, Knights said. It likely will start in June. Information is what will stop this black market, he said, adding that many Chinese people are unaware consuming pangolin is illegal -- or think that the pangolin is abundant. ""We're trying to make it uncool to consume them,"" he told me. There's reason to believe it will work. In the two years after WildAid ran ads in China discouraging consumption of shark fin soup, consumption of shark fin soup has dropped by 50% to 70%, Knights said. I hope they'll be able to do the same for the humble pangolin. And I'd encourage you to contribute to the effort. To do so: Go to WildAid's online donation page. In the comments on that page, write that you would like your contribution to go to the pangolin media campaign in China. Encourage friends to do the same. A number of other groups are doing fine work to raise awareness about the pangolin -- and, importantly, to rehabilitate pangolins that have been rescued from the black-market trade, especially in Vietnam. Consider a World Pangolin Day donation to these organizations: . (Note: The financial statements of these groups, as well as WildAid, have been vetted by CNN.) Awareness helps. Read about the pangolin at SavePangolins.org or on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's website. Share some of your favorite pangolin facts on Twitter and Facebook. World Pangolin Day organizers will be posting info and celebrations throughout the day using these hashtags: . Here are a few social accounts you can follow for updates: . And feel free to reuse or retweet this image: . I rarely meet adults who know about pangolins -- that is, unless they have young kids. Children are so much more curious about and engaged with the natural world, and, if my friends' kids are a barometer, a growing number of them seem to be learning about the pangolin in school. I'd encourage you to talk with your kids about the pangolin -- see what they know and what they don't. If your kids are little, read ""Roly Poly Pangolin"" to them. Save Pangolins co-founder Keri Parker suggested kids (or adults, whatever ...) try out this pangolin coloring sheet. Parker also recommended parents make ant-shaped cookies with their children in honor of the pangolin's ant-based diet. Whatever you do, please let me know about it! You can leave a comment at the bottom of this page -- or shoot me a note on Twitter. I'll retweet some of the most creative pangolin tributes. (Especially if you get a tattoo). And thank you for caring about this awesome and underappreciated animal.","World Pangolin Day is Saturday, in honor of the endangered, scale-covered mammal .

"(CNN)Twelve years ago, Rachel Miller was lost when it came to her son John. The 7-year-old was profoundly disabled because of his autism. Unable to speak, he withdrew from people at school and, worse, from his family. In March 2003, Miller was introduced to Jeff Hancock, a one-on-one therapist for people with autism, and things started to feel a little more manageable. Hancock was hired to be John's companion. The two would go people-watching at the mall in Stuart, Florida, on the weekends. Hancock chatted throughout their excursions, even though John couldn't talk back. Their relationship evolved when Hancock introduced John to the Special Olympics in Martin County. Hancock, a longtime volunteer for the organization, and Miller decided John should get involved in sports after they saw a rare sight: Whenever John was running or being active, he was smiling. Up until that point, Miller said, it was virtually impossible to get John involved with sports because of his condition. ""There were very few people who knew how to handle a disability as severe as John's,"" she said. ""Even teachers and professionals were unable to reach him."" One area of difficulty was communication. John couldn't speak and was mainly unresponsive to people. And people distanced themselves when they saw the teen injure himself. John would bite his arms and hands and even hit himself with powerful blows to the head, Miller said. As John got older, his behavioral issues intensified. But while teachers and peers drew away, Hancock stood closer by his side. When John turned 12, Hancock introduced him to track at the Special Olympics. For the first three years, the pair just observed the sport by watching practices and events. Hancock worked daily with John, showing him everything, including where to sit, stand and walk, so he would understand the flow of the events. Eventually, the lessons clicked, and John was off doing 50-meter sprints. John was racing because he loved to run, not because he wanted to compete, Hancock explained. ""Winning is not in his vocabulary. We put him in smaller races so that he could finish,"" Hancock said. Finishing the races was a way to boost John's confidence. ""He learned that when he finished the race he could see his mom, and get a drink, and get hugs."" But as John got older, he got stronger and faster. At 16, he was jumping hurdles and doing 800-meter races. Miller started seeing her son as a serious athlete. Off the field, John was closed off to the world, but on the track he shined. ""John's head will be down a lot when he is trying to have social interactions. But when he is running, his form is perfect,"" she said. John even verbalizes on the field, joyously yelling. ""It sounds like he is happy,"" Miller said. In May 2014, John's training brought him to the Special Olympics State Summer Games in Orlando. The 18-year-old was competing in the 800 meters and the 110-meter hurdles. As the 800 was setting up, Miller remembered, she pressed her face against the fence, anxiously waiting for John to compete. The lanes were filled and the runners took their positions. Miller's mind raced: Would John would be OK in front of hundreds of cheering spectators? Would he would trip? Would he even finish? But as soon as the race started, her fears melted away, and all Miller saw was an athlete, her athlete. ""I just wanted to see the best performance. It seemed much more significant than whether he would ever speak or respond to me,"" she said. John ended up winning the gold medal for the 800. Sports completely changed John, and Miller said that is because of Hancock. ""A person with a disability can feel hopeless and isolated, and I think that can happen to parents, too. Jeff probably saw that with us,"" Miller said, thinking back to when Hancock first met their family. ""John was never expected to be an athlete,"" Miller said. ""But if John could speak, he would say his coach always expected it.""","Rachel Miller's son John, 18, is severely autistic and struggles with personal connections .

"(CNN) -- A computer hacker who calls himself ""The Jester"" claimed responsibility for the cyber attack which took down the WikiLeaks site Sunday, shortly before it started posting hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. diplomatic cables. The Jester, who describes himself as a ""hacktivist for good,"" said he took the controversial site down ""for attempting to endanger the lives of our troops, 'other assets' & foreign relations."" He normally attacks Islamist websites, announcing ""TANGO DOWN"" on his Twitter account when claiming to have attacked a site. ""Tango Down"" is Special Forces jargon for having eliminated a terrorist. Over the past few days, the Jester has targeted a handful of websites for reasons including ""online incitement to cause young Muslims to carry out acts of violent jihad,"" ""distributing jihadist instructional materials,"" and ""for the online radicalization of young Muslims in US and Europe."" The Jester describes himself as ""an ex-soldier with a rather famous unit, country purposely not specified."" ""I was involved with supporting Special Forces, I have served in (and around) Afghanistan amongst other places,"" he told the website threatchaos.com early this year. WikiLeaks said in September that it had prepared an unspecified ""insurance policy"" against its site being taken down. ""This annoyed me... so I got busy,"" the Jester wrote on his blog in September. Cyber security expert Mikko Hypponen of F-Secure believes the Jester was really behind the hack, he told CNN. WikiLeaks was down for several hours Sunday, spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said Monday. He said he did not know who was behind it, and he seemed surprised when CNN told him an anti-Islamist hacker was taking credit. WikiLeaks excites ""a lot of strong emotions,"" Hrafnsson said. The hacker did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. WikiLeaks posted that it was under attack at about 11 a.m. ET Sunday, not long before its latest and largest leak. The site seemed to be running normally as of early Monday morning. CNN's Nicola Hughes contributed to this report.","NEW: The claim is genuine, a cybersecurity expert says .

"Fotokol, Cameroon (CNN)A Cameroonian soldier lies in a trench, the tip of his Kalashnikov rifle pointing toward the Nigerian town of Gambaru, which has been taken over by Boko Haram terrorists. A pickup loaded with Chadian troops crosses the bridge into Gambaru to reinforce their peers locked in an hours-long heavy exchange of gunfire with Boko Haram fighters. A suspected terrorist attempts to cross the El Beid River, which separates Gambaru from Fotokol in Cameroon, but is hit by a bullet from a Cameroonian soldier. That battle took place on February 11, but ""fighting here has become a daily occurrence,"" says Maj. Nlate Ebale of the Rapid Intervention Battalion -- known as BIR -- of the Cameroon military. Earlier this month, Boko Haram militants attacked Fotokol, burning churches, mosques and homes. They also slaughtered youths who resisted joining them. Almost 100 people died in the attack, said Col. Jacob Kodji, commander of the 4th Inter-Military Region. ""They came in at about 5 a.m. We were praying in the mosque, and all of a sudden we heard them shouting, 'Allahu akbar' ('God is great'). I left the mosque immediately and went home to my family. When I came back, they had slaughtered 37 people in the mosque,"" Modou Boukar, a Fotokol resident, told CNN. The dusty roads of the once bustling town are now deserted. Frequent exchanges of gunfire between Boko Haram fighters and the combined Cameroonian and Chadian soldiers have driven many away. Only elderly people and some children remain, Kodji says. ""Chadian troops here have the mandate to fight Boko Haram right at their base in Gambaru,"" Ebale says. ""We have to secure this bridge and stop the terrorists from crossing over into Cameroon. So we do work in synergy with Chadian forces here."" In February, Chadian troops launched a large offensive in Gambaru, using land and air forces, killing some 200 Boko Haram militants, Kodji says. But Boko Haram keeps coming back. ""We kill them all the time, but we are surprised they keep coming. It is likely the intelligence services might have underestimated the striking power of the terrorists,"" Col. Joseph Nouma, commander of Operation ALPHA -- a special operation to weed out Boko Haram -- tells CNN. ""We register at least one to two Boko Haram attacks in different localities a day,"" he says. Several African nations -- including Niger, Benin, Cameroon, Chad and Nigeria -- have pledged to deploy 8,700 troops, police and civilians as part of a regional effort to fight Boko Haram. The violence in northeast Nigeria has caused more than 157,000 people to flee into Niger, Cameroon and Chad, Adrian Edwards, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said in February. Nearly 1 million more people are believed to be internally displaced inside northeast Nigeria, according to Nigeria's national emergency management agency, Edwards said. Capt. Bea Hob, who commands a Cameroon BIR unit, says that on October 15, Boko Haram carried out simultaneous attacks on the Cameroon towns of Amchide and Limani, killing eight Cameroonian soldiers and dozens of civilians. Amchide, 15 kilometers (9 miles) from Fotokol, borders Nigeria's Borno state, a stronghold of the Islamist terrorist group. Since the insurgents began regular cross-border raids this year, killing hundreds of Cameroonians, most of the town's residents have fled south. Only a few elderly people remain, Hob says. Amchide has become a military base to protect the area from insurgents. Soldiers patrol the streets in armored vehicles and lie in trenches. But the military has become a major target for Boko Haram attacks. ""It was at about 4 a.m. when we heard them shouting from four different angles of our base. Then it was clear that their intention was to strike our base. It was definitely a difficult situation to handle, given that they were coming from different directions. ""I ordered that the lone tank we had should be deployed in such a way that the terrorists would think we had at least four tanks. So we would rush to one angle, shoot for about 15 minutes and then rush to the next angle, shoot for 15 minutes. ... Within hours, we were able to put the terrorists to rout,"" Hob says. He said Boko Haram has been shifting its tactics. Unable to carry out direct combat with Cameroonian soldiers, they use improvised explosive devices to ambush military convoys and civilian buses, disrupting movement of goods and people in the region. Cameroon security sources say that Boko Haram attacks villages ""to steal food, carry out forced marriages on the girls they kidnap; forcefully recruit children who are later brainwashed to joining their hate doctrine, as well as steal weapons."" Porous borders ease their incursions into Cameroon. A spokesman for the Cameroon Defense Ministry, Col. Didier Badjeck, says that since the war began some two years ago, Cameroon has killed more than 2,000 Boko Haram fighters and lost about 100 soldiers.","Cameroon and Chadian forces fight Boko Haram militants across the border area with Nigeria .

"Ah, Cliven Bundy -- poster boy for the anti-government, rugged-individualist crowd. The Marlboro Man for the conservative fantasy world. Or not. Cliven Bundy is so bizarre he leaves late night comedians spluttering. (Just check out one of Jon Stewart's riffs.) His comments about race were so embarrassing that Sean Hannity, who had called Bundy ""a friend and frequent guest of the show,"" had to do a ""protest too much"" denouncement. Yes, Hannity called Bundy's words ""beyond repugnant"" -- but only after first promoting him as a patriot par excellence. Republican office-holders, such as Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, who had been cheerleading Bundy and his rabble also had to distance themselves, many of them fumbling with their rhetorical pom-poms in the process. Here's the basic background: Bundy is a wealthy Nevada rancher who believes he has ""beneficial use"" claim to grazing lands owned by the federal government. Ownership of the land is not a matter of dispute. Bundy has been in and out of protracted court battles for decades, and he's lost every time. In 1993, Bundy stopped paying the grazing fees for using federal Bureau of Land Management land.  His fees accumulated to $1 million. Finally, after two courts ruled in the bureau's favor, it moved to seize Bundy's cattle, planning to sell them at auction to pay for the 20 years' worth of grazing fees. On April 5, the bureau brought in armed federal agents and began removing Bundy's cattle. Bundy's son Dave was arrested for refusing to leave. That night, Bundy sent a message: ""They have my cattle and now they have one of my boys. Range War begins tomorrow."" Visions of the Wild West, anyone? Frontier justice? Or not. Bundy's supporters rallied around him, traveling from out of state. That's when the bizarre started. Richard Mack, a former Arizona sheriff, said, ""We're actually strategizing to put all the women up at the front. If they are going to start shooting, it's going to be women that are going to be televised all across the world getting shot by these rogue federal officers."" How's that for a jaw-dropper? The standoff lasted a week, until the bureau announced on April 12 that it would return the seized cattle because of its ""grave concern about the safety of employees and members of the public."" Conservatives and Republicans cheered. Well, not all of them. You see, Bundy based his claim that he did not have to pay the grazing fees because -- well, here are his words: ""I believe this is a sovereign state of Nevada. And I abide by all Nevada state laws. But I don't recognize the United States government as even existing."" Or not. You see, Bundy is violating the Constitution of Nevada, and therefore the state's laws. Article 1, Section 2 of that state's constitution reads, in part:  ""...the Paramount Allegiance of every citizen is due to the Federal ...and no power exists in the people of this or any other State of the Federal Union to dissolve their connection therewith..."" Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer told Fox News: ""This is a man who said that he doesn't recognize the authority of the United States of America. That makes him a patriot? I love this country, I love the Constitution, and it is the Constitution that established a government that all of us have to recognize. And for him to reject it was the beginning of all of this. And now what he said today is just the end of this."" That's the point. We can disagree about policies and politics, and even whether baseball or football is ""America's sport."" Hopefully we'll again get to a place in our civic discourse where we can be civil and compromise for the common good, to move toward that ""more perfect Union"" the Constitution mentions. But denying the very existence of the United States? Still, that's not what had other Republicans and conservative pontificators going, ""oops."" It was Bundy's obscene, racist remarks: ""And because they [Blacks] were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they do? They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. And I've often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn't get no more freedom. They got less freedom."" That's why Republicans are distancing themselves from Bundy. Because Bundy's words destroy their argument that we shouldn't talk about race. Bundy's remarks, following so closely on the Supreme Court's Schuette decision, refute Chief Justice John Roberts' misguided insistence that ""racism will end when we stop helping minorities"" and prove Justice Sonia Sotomayor right when she says that the act of ignoring pervasive structural racism is an abdication of judicial responsibility. Thanks to the federal government and men and women of valor who fought for those words written in our Constitution, we can have this debate. And it is that same Constitution that gives even a racist idiot like Bundy freedom to spew his lunacy while riding his horse and waving his American flag, even if some Republicans now pretend they've never heard of the guy. Or not. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Donna Brazile looks at the furor around Bundy and wonders if Republicans are in denial .

"(CNN)Lynsey Addario was five months pregnant and taking photos of skeletal children in the Horn of Africa, when she felt her own baby kicking for the first time. ""He came to life as a little person inside me as I entered Somalia, the land ridden with death,"" writes the Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist, of an assignment covering drought victims in 2011. In Addario's line of work, death -- and new life -- abound. Since the mid-1990s, she has covered the Taliban in Afghanistan, the war in Iraq, the Syrian refugee crisis, and countless more conflicts for media outlets including Getty Images, The New York Times, and National Geographic. Her spectacular and deeply intimate images shine a light on places few would dare to travel, and are now gathered together for the first time in a vivid memoir called ""It's what I do: A photographer's life of love and war."" The pictures of malnourished toddlers in Somalia that day came as Addario was coming to terms with her own pregnancy. Until he started kicking inside of her, the 41-year-old had only ever thought of unborn son Lukas as a ""pea"" or ""avocado pit."" This was an entirely new jolt of reality for the tenacious American photographer -- ""Before Lukas, you know I didn't really think about my mortality,"" she told CNN. ""Becoming a mother hasn't necessarily changed how I shoot, but it certainly has made me more sensitive, and it certainly makes it much harder for me to photograph dying children,"" she said, her voice warm and raspy over the phone from New York. That's not to say Addario has stepped away from the action since having a child with husband and former Reuters journalist Paul de Bendern; the family now based in London. After all, this is the same woman who covered a prisoner exchange in the Gaza Strip, while seven months pregnant with her first child, and less than a year after being kidnapped in Libya. She still goes into war zones, though these days tries to stay away from the front line. ""I always knew my death would be a possible consequence of the work I do. But for me it was a price I was willing to pay because this is what I believed in,"" she said. ""Now I think 'OK, I want to cover that story, but how can I do it in a way that I can get home to Lukas?"" Motherhood isn't the only thing that's changed the stakes on the battlefield. Last month ISIS released a video showing the beheading of Japanese film-maker Kenji Goto -- the latest in a string of gruesome journalist deaths throughout 2014. This is a dangerous new era for war correspondents in the Middle East, says Addario, who went undercover documenting the lives of women under Taliban rule well before 9/11 even happened. When the Twin Towers fell, Addario was one of the few journalists to have an insider's knowledge of working in Afghanistan, and throughout the decade made a name for herself as one of the most accomplished reporters in the region. ""When I first started out I really felt like: 'I'm a journalist, I will be respected as a neutral observer,"" she said.  ""And I don't feel like that holds true anymore. I don't think people respect journalists the same way they once did."" ""In fact, we are a target because there's a bounty on our heads. ISIS can make a huge amount of money from journalists, though there are some countries who do not pay ransom like the U.S. or the UK."" Addario knows that danger first hand. In 2011, she and three other New York Times journalists were kidnapped by pro-Qaddafi soldiers in Libya, and over several horrifying days were bound, punched and groped, before being released. She describes being blindfolded while one of her captors ""caressed my face like a lover,"" repeating the same Arabic phrase over and over. ""Slowly he ran his hands over my hair and spoke to me in a slow, steady voice,"" Addario writes in her memoir. ""What is he saying, Anthony?"" she asked one of her fellow captives. ""Anthony took his time in answering. 'He's telling you that you will die tonight.'"" Addario not only lived through the ordeal -- within months she was back working in Senegal, Saudi Arabia, and Afghanistan. If her experience in Libya didn't put her off -- what would? ""I'm at the point where I've been kidnapped twice, two of my drivers have died, I've lost so many friends, and every time something happens it does set me back a bit,"" she said matter-of-factly. ""But I don't think it's just one event that will basically turn me away forever, I just don't think that's the kind of person I am."" The youngest of four sisters born to Italian-American hairdresser parents in Connecticut , Addario's family home was ""a kaleidoscope of transvestites and Village People lookalikes, a haven for people who weren't accepted elsewhere,"" she writes. There was an open-door policy for the marginalized of society, and it put her in good stead for a life interviewing those living on edges. ""Now I go into all these situations and I really don't feel like I judge people -- I just accept people for who they are and record their stories,"" she said. Even as we speak, the death toll from fighting in Ukraine rises, and while other people might thank their lucky stars they're far from the crossfire, Addario feels ""constantly tormented but what I'm not covering."" ""I feel bad that I'm not there,"" she said of the conflict. ""I know my perspective on these things is the complete opposite to so many people. But I feel a responsibility, I feel like I need to do it because I have the tools to cover war, and because I've done it for so many years. ""It's very hard to turn your back once you're aware of what's going on, and you're aware of the injustices, and you're aware of the civilian casualties,"" she said. ""It's much easier if you have no idea and you've never seen it."" Indeed Addario's job is to keep her eyes open, where others must look away. She offers us a window into someone else's hell, and yet possesses a special talent for finding moments of tenderness and hope among the rubble. Being a female photojournalist has also given her unique access to intensely private worlds, often out-of-bounds for her overwhelmingly male colleagues. She can capture the horror and determination of women in rape centers in the Democratic Republic of Congo; self-immolation patients in Afghanistan; and death during childbirth in Sierra Leone. It takes a strong stomach -- and mind -- for this line of work, and Addario's book opens with a gruesome description of an airstrike in Ajdabiya, Libya. ""There was part of a brain on the passenger seat; shards of skull were embedded in the rear parcel shelf. Hospital employees in white medical uniforms carefully picked up the pieces and placed them in a bag,"" she writes. How does she cope with the unimaginable horror year after year?"" I do take it away with me, and I'm sure I do suffer from trauma. But I feel as though I'm pretty well adjusted,"" she said. ""I do think that the more I cover war, the luckier I feel. I was born in the U.S.... in Connecticut of all places, and so I think it's very important to not forget that."" Perhaps covering war doesn't require a hardened heart -- just an exceptionally large one.","War photographer Lynsey Addario has been kidnapped twice -- why does she keep going back?

"(CNN) -- Mexico and the United States will be going to the 2010 World Cup finals after winning their penultimate matches in CONCACAF qualifying on Saturday night. Francisco Palencia (left) celebrates his goal as Mexico secured their place in the finals. Mexico, who struggled in their earlier qualifying matches while former England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson was in charge, had an easy 4-1 home win over El Salvador, while the U.S scored a memorable 3-2 victory in Honduras. The wins keeps the U.S. top of the group with 19 points from nine games with Mexico a point further adrift. Costa  Rica won 4-0 against Trinidad and Tobago to move into the third and final qualifying spot in the group ahead of next Wednesday's final round of matches with Honduras one point behind them. Costa Rica visit the U.S. with fourth-placed Honduras in El Salvador. The fourth-placed team in the CONCACAF group face the fifth-placed team from South America, which could be Diego Maradona's Argentina, in a playoff for a World Cup place. Honduras will be ruing lost opportunities against the Americans as they led through Julio De Leon goal early in the second half before Conor Casey scored twice for the visitors to put them ahead. De Leon scored the equalizer before Landon Donovan curled home a free kick in the 70th minute to give the visitors the lead again. Still the drama was not over and  Honduras were awarded a penalty in the 86th minute after a handball by Stuart Holden but Carlos Pavon, the leading scorer for Honduras in internationals, sent his effort over the crossbar. Mexico scored three goals in the last 20 minutes after an own goal from Marvin Gonzalez of El Salvador had put them 1-0 up in the 25th minute. Cuauhtemoc Blanco gave the hosts a 2-0 lead in the 70th minute and Francisco Palencia added a third. Julio Martinez scored a consolation for El Salvador in the 87th minute before Arsenal's Carlos Vela rounded off the scoring for Mexico as they sealed their place. New Costa Rica coach Rene Simoes saw his new charges move to the brink of automatic qualification with an easy win over eliminated Trinidad. Alvaro Saborio scored twice and Walter Centeno added another, after Radanfa Abubakr's own goal had put them on their way.","Mexico and United States both qualify for World Cup finals in South Africa .

"(CNN)The CDC has discovered a new virus that may have contributed to a Kansas man's death, the agency announced Friday. Named the Bourbon virus after the county where the patient lived, the virus is likely spread by tick or insect bites, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. A 50-year-old man suffered multiple tick bites in the spring of 2014 while working outside on his property, the CDC said in an article published in the agency's ""Infectious Diseases"" journal. The man fell ill over the next two days, went to a doctor on the third day, was hospitalized and died of a heart attack 11 days after becoming sick, the CDC said. While the man was hospitalized, test results for many infectious diseases came back negative, the press release said. A blood sample was sent to the CDC, which determined a new virus had been discovered, the press release said. The man's symptoms included fever, tiredness, rash, headache, other body aches, nausea and vomiting, the website said. The man had low blood counts for cells that fight infection and help prevent bleeding, the website said. Though the CDC only has one case to work with, the agency said ""it is likely that Bourbon virus is spread through tick or other insect bites."" The CDC recommends people protect themselves by tick bites by using insect repellents, wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants, avoiding bushy and wooded areas and checking for ticks after spending time outdoors. The Bourbon virus is part of a group of viruses linked to tick or insect bites in Europe, Asia and Africa, the CDC said. This is the first time a virus in this group, known as thogotoviruses, has been known to cause illness in the United States, the CDC said.","The CDC named the Bourbon virus after the Kansas county where the patient lived .

"(CNN)Australia's Queensland coast continued to be lashed by heavy rain and winds exceeding 250 kilometers per hour (155 mph) Friday, despite Tropical Cyclone Marcia being downgraded to a Category 4 storm. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk warned the storm remained ""very serious"" and urged the public in affected areas to remain indoors amid the threat of flooding and high winds, which have brought down trees and caused some damage to homes. During a press conference, she said the storm system was now moving south along the coast from the town of Yeppoon towards Rockhampton, which lies 595 kilometers (370 miles) north of Brisbane, the state capital. Around 33,000 households in the area are now without power, she said, warning that this number was likely to grow as the day progresses. ""It is still a dangerous cyclone. We are heartened that it has reduced from a (Category) five to a four, but ... it is heading towards Rockhampton, a heavily populated regional town in Queensland, and we want everyone to be safe. So stay in doors,"" Palaszczuk said. Queensland's Bureau of Meteorology said the Yeppoon area, where some 800 people were forced into temporary shelters, had seen the most ""destructive winds"" after the storm made landfall at around 8 a.m. Friday (5 p.m. ET Thursday). But it said the winds would weaken further by the time it reached Rockhampton -- though Category 3 winds in excess of 100 kph (62 mph) were still destructive. Along the coast, the storm brought higher than normal tides and dangerous surf conditions. Chris Campey, a video journalist for the CNN affiliate, described the ocean waves as ""intimidating."" Seven News reporter Tom Hartley posted a video that showed winds whipping through palm trees as heavy rains pelted Rosslyn Bay.

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN)At least 15 people, including two members of Parliament and a deputy mayor, were killed Friday when militants attacked a hotel frequented by government officials in the heart of Somalia's capital, police said. The bloodshed began when a car packed with explosives blew up near the main gate of the high-profile Central Hotel, which is a few miles from Somalia's presidential palace, Mogadishu police Capt. Hassan Abdi told CNN. The explosion was followed by heavy gunfire between the attackers and hotel guards, witnesses said. Then came a second blast -- a suicide bombing carried out by a woman near a mosque inside the hotel -- as other attackers shot their way in, Abdi said. ""I saw ... several people burned by the flames of the explosions lying on the blood-filled ground inside the hotel,"" said Mustaf Mohamed, who runs a small shop nearby. Government ministers, members of Parliament, army officers and other officials often go to the Central Hotel. Deputy Prime Minister Mohamed Omar Arte was among those inside at the time of the attack, having just attended traditional Friday prayers there. He suffered minor injuries but survived, according to state media, as did Transportation Minister Ali Jama Jangeli. But other prominent politicians did not make it. They include Parliament members Hajji Gafe and Ali Omar, as well as Mohamed Aden Guled, Mogadishu's deputy mayor, Abdi said. In addition to the dead, 20 others were wounded in the attack. Al-Shabaab, an Islamist extremist group blamed for terrorist acts in Somalia and beyond over the years, claimed responsibility, Sheikh Abdiaziz Abu Musab, a spokesman, said on militant-run Andulus radio. Villa Somalia, the East African country's equivalent of the U.S. White House, sharply condemned what it called ""today's outrage."" The presidential palace tweeted, citing President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, ""#AlShabaab are un-Islamic and anti-democracy."" Since emerging in the mid-2000s, Al-Shabaab has been intent on taking control of Somalia, one of the world's poorest countries, with a gross domestic product per person that ranks 226th out of 228 countries. Its militants have repeatedly targeted Somali officials, soldiers and institutions in the East African nation. The group's focus has broadened, especially since then-leader Ahmed Godane announced in 2012 that his followers ""will march with (al Qaeda) as loyal soldiers."" What is Al-Shabaab, and what does it want? The following year, Al-Shabaab carried out its most high-profile operation yet at the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya. Shoppers were gunned down, held hostage and tortured. Four days later, the siege ended with as many as 67 dead and parts of the mall destroyed. Al-Shabaab has never forgotten its home base of Somalia. The Somali government, helped by allies including the United States and African Union, has managed to strike significant blows against the group, including a 2014 U.S. operation that killed Godane. But Al-Shabaab has continued its campaign of violence in attacks such as a suicide blast last month on a Somali army convoy in Mogadishu, the bombing of a bus carrying Kenyan teachers in Galkayo, Somalia, and an attack on an African Union military base. Journalist Omar Nor reported from Mogadishu, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote from Atlanta.","Al-Shabaab was behind the attack, a spokesman for the group says .

"Grief counselors Wednesday visited the West Palm Beach, Florida, school of two teens allegedly killed by their mother in an apparent double murder-suicide, a school district official told CNN. Alex Berman, 16, along with his 15-year-old sister, Jacqueline, were found shot to death in their home Monday in an upscale South Florida neighborhood. The teens' mother, Jennifer Berman, 48, was also found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to CNN affiliates. The siblings were both promising musicians -- Alex was a cellist, Jacqueline a violinist -- at the prestigious Alexander W. Dreyfoos School of the Arts where they were straight-A students, according to local media reports. ""Of course we are deeply saddened by the events and the loss of Alexander and Jacqueline Berman,"" School District of Palm Beach County spokeswoman Natalia Powers said. ""We have a group of counselors that are going to the school and have been going there since Monday to assist any of our students or staff that need any additional assistance. We want to help them cope with this given the circumstances."" In a 911 call released by the West Palm Beach Police Department, Richard Berman, the teens' father, rushed to the home after he received a bizarre e-mail from his ex-wife, the teens' mother. Berman called police on the way to the home he once shared with his family. ""I'm just about getting there, but it's kind of concerning me,"" Berman said in the call. ""My ex-wife said she was going to harm the kids and that I should get over there ASAP. I'm afraid to go in. My neighbor went in, and there's blood up on the wall and near her bedroom."" ""There's all this blood upstairs. The police are here right now,"" a neighbor could be heard saying on the 911 call. ""I think the girl is up in bed with her, but once I got up there and I saw what was up there I had to run back downstairs,"" she added. Berman told the 911 dispatcher that he recalled his ex-wife had her father's old rifles in the house. Police have not released a motive for murder-suicide. According to court records, the Bermans had recently divorced after more than 20 years of marriage. In August, court documents show Jennifer Berman was given exclusive use and possession of the home where the killings happened because of ""extreme emotional abuse ... in the home."" Court paperwork filed by Jennifer Berman also showed signs of financial turmoil, indicating her ex-husband did not pay the mortgage, despite living in the house during the divorce proceedings. ""He has not contributed to the support of the wife or of the minor children. In fact, he has refused to pay for toilet paper, buys food and supplies for himself and keeps them where the wife and children cannot access them,"" court records said. The mother's financial state was bad enough that she sold her late father's watch to buy gas, groceries and clothes for the children, according to documents. A well-known real estate broker in the area, Richard Berman also was dealing with tough financial circumstances of his own, court documents indicated. An affidavit filed in October said he was running a monthly debt of nearly $2,000. Overall, Berman had debts of more than $790,000, according to court paperwork. CNN's attempts to get in touch with the Richard Berman were unsuccessful. Police declined to comment or release an incident report. Neighbors were shocked to hear the news. Others said they had seen a noticeable change in the mother's appearance. ""Oh, God, I can't talk about this. I just can't. I loved Alex and Jackie so much they are like my own kids. Alex was always at my house. He was my son's best friend,"" Dawn Alba told CNN affiliate WPBF. ""A couple of days ago, she was different,"" neighbor Marian Sklodowsk told CNN affiliate WSVN.

"(CNN)The first headlines immediately after the attack at the office of Charlie Hebdo in Paris provide a snapshot of the massacre: Two masked men killed 12 people. That picture looks much more complex one week later. Two more attacks -- against a police officer and another that included hostages at a kosher supermarket -- brought the final death toll to 17, plus three suspects killed. The threads that investigators have followed -- from the newsroom of the satirical magazine and the Paris supermarket -- have led to other countries, including Yemen, Turkey, Syria and Bulgaria. The untangling of who was behind the attacks has also revealed other suspects, and there have been claims of links to the biggest terrorist groups, al Qaeda and ISIS, which now calls itself the Islamic State. Here is a look at the key people, places and questions that have surfaced as investigators probe more deeply: . French Prime Minister Manuel Valls has virtually ruled out a ""lone wolf"" scenario. Besides Said and Cherif Kouachi, the brothers identified as the shooters at Charlie Hebdo who were later killed by police, another man, Amedy Coulibaly, has been linked to the attacks. Police killed him last week after he took hostages at the Paris kosher grocery store. There is one named suspect at large: Hayat Boumeddiene, Coulibaly's widow. But there are other suspects. French citizen Fritz-Joly Joachin was arrested in Bulgaria at the border with Turkey on an unrelated charge, but he faces terrorism charges in connection with the Kouachis. And French security services have identified a suspected accomplice in the kosher grocery attack, according to the French newspaper Le Parisien. Police sources cited by the newspaper said one line of investigation is that the accomplice, a man from a Paris suburb, may have driven Coulibaly to the market, where Coulibaly later shot dead four people. ""We are doing everything we can to dismantle what appears to be a network. ... No doubt there was complicity and networks and maybe finance also,"" Valls told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Given the magnitude of the operations and the apparent sophistication of the gunmen, many wonder who, if anyone, trained or possibly gave orders to the attackers. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, has claimed credit for the magazine attack. ""When the heroes were assigned, they accepted. They promised and fulfilled,"" AQAP commander Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi said in a video message, referring to the Kouachi brothers and the slayings at Charlie Hebdo. The late U.S.-born Muslim cleric  Anwar al-Awlaki is the one who masterminded that operation  before his 2011 death, AQAP said. Past statements by the three main suspects claim allegiance to al Qaeda or ISIS, an unsatisfying answer because the two terror groups are considered rivals. Both jihadist groups have an Islamist worldview, however, and it is possible that even if the suspects plotted together, they may have been inspired by different groups. Cherif and Said Kouachi are both said to have traveled to Yemen. Cherif, before he was killed by police, told CNN affiliate BFMTV that he'd trained in Yemen with AQAP. Cherif Kouachi used his brother's passport to travel to Yemen in 2011, two Western intelligence sources with knowledge of the matter told CNN, adding that it was likely he had trained with AQAP there. A senior Yemeni national security official told CNN that Said had also entered Yemen multiple times. Coulibaly also called BFMTV before he was killed. He purportedly said by phone that he belonged to ISIS. That information hasn't been corroborated by authorities, and it's not known whether he knew any leaders or members of that terrorist group. In the aftermath of the Paris attacks, his widow, Boumeddiene, is believed to have fled to Syria, where ISIS operates. Gunman tried to justify market raid to hostages, recording apparently shows . Terrorism experts say ISIS and al Qaeda have an adversarial relationship, so how are the self-proclaimed al Qaeda followers Said and Cherif Kouachi linked to the self-proclaimed ISIS member Coulibaly? Said Kouachi's wife told investigators that her husband and Coulibaly knew each other well. French court documents show that Coulibaly and Cherif Kouachi were also close associates and plotted to stage a prison break to free a fellow terrorist in 2010. Kouachi and Coulibaly had a mentor in common, a radical named Djamel Beghal. Once known as al Qaeda's premiere European recruiter, Beghal was convicted of conspiring to attack the U.S. Embassy in Paris. The attack was years in the making, AQAP claims, and was conceived as revenge for Charlie Hebdo's depictions of the Prophet Mohammed. Al-Ansi blamed not only the satirical magazine, but also France and the United States in his statement. ""It is France that has shared all of America's crimes,"" al-Ansi added. ""It is France that has committed crimes in Mali and the Islamic Maghreb. It is France that supports the annihilation of Muslims in Central Africa in the name of race cleansing."" (""Islamic Maghreb"" refers to North Africa.) U.S. officials told CNN it's believed that when Cherif Kouachi traveled to Yemen in 2011, he returned carrying money from AQAP earmarked to carry out the attack. Investigators said the terrorist group could have given as much as $20,000, but the exact amount has not been verified. It is notable that AQAP did not claim responsibility for the siege at the Paris kosher grocery store where four hostages were killed, along with gunman Coulibaly. AQAP praised the attack at the kosher grocery store, calling it a ""blessing from Allah"" that happened at the same time as the attack on Charlie Hebdo's office. Boumeddiene's name came to light in the Paris attacks shortly after the Kouachi brothers were identified. She was named a suspect together with her husband, Coulibaly. There were initial reports that she had fled after the kosher market attack, but this was not confirmed, and new evidence suggests that she was not in France at all during the attacks. But she could be a key to unraveling the details behind the attacks. Authorities are looking into whether Boumeddiene helped prepare the attacks before leaving France. Boumeddiene arrived in Turkey from Madrid on January 2, five days before the first attack in Paris, Turkey's Anadolu news agency reports. Boumeddiene stayed at an Istanbul hotel and then traveled to Syria on Thursday, Andalou said. The last place authorities spotted Boumeddiene was somewhere near Turkey's border with Syria. A surveillance video image shows her at an Istanbul airport with a man beside her. On Tuesday, France's Le Monde newspaper identified the man as Mehdi Belhoucine, describing him as someone known to French intelligence and who could have ties to a separate jihadist cell. Belhoucine's brother, the newspaper said, was imprisoned last year for helping send fighters to Afghanistan and Pakistan. He is French citizen Fritz-Joly Joachin. He was arrested near the border with Turkey for allegedly kidnapping his son, Bulgarian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Betina Joteva said. The ministry said that Joachin will remain in custody until at least January 20, when a ""court will consider (a) second warrant related to terrorism charges."" A Bulgarian prosecutor said the terrorism charge is regarding Joachin's contacts with the Kouachi brothers, AFP reported. ""The charges are for participation in an organized crime group whose aim was ... terrorist acts,"" the prosecutor said. Bulgarian officials referred further questions to French authorities. It is unclear what Joachin's contact with the Kouachi brothers entailed. As French officials dig deeper into the suspects behind the attacks, they must deal with a new threat from an al Qaeda affiliate. The affiliate in North Africa, the Islamic Maghreb, published a threat against France on jihadist websites. ""France pays the cost of its violence on Muslim countries and the violation of their sanctity,"" the group said in its statement. ""As long as its soldiers occupy countries such as Mali and Central Africa and bombard our people in Syria and Iraq, and as long as its lame media continues to undermine our Prophet (Mohammed), France will expose itself to the worst and more.""

"A Maryland mother stabbed two of her children to death and wounded two others while attempting an exorcism, authorities said. Zakieya L. Avery, 28, was charged Saturday with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder, Montgomery County Police said in a statement. A second woman, who was briefly hospitalized after the incident, was also charged in the two deaths. Police believe she is not related to the family, but lived at the same residence in Germantown. Norell Harris, 1, and his sister, Zyana Harris, 2, suffered fatal stab wounds while their siblings, ages 5 and 8, were hospitalized with injuries, authorities said. ""Cases like this are heartbreaking,"" county Police Chief Tom Manger said. ""Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the victims."" Police said they found the four children Friday morning after a neighbor called 911 to report suspicious activity at the home. The neighbor reported seeing a car with a door open and a knife next to it. Exorcism is a ritual aimed at defeating purported evil spirits or demons. Authorities did not provide additional details on why they suspected exorcism. ""Investigators have learned that the two defendants believed that they were performing an exorcism. The investigation into this motive and other aspects of the crime continue at this point,"" police said. Police were called to the home Thursday over reports of an unattended child in a car. By the time they got there, the child was not in the car and no one came to the door, authorities said. ""Prior to officers arriving, two women exited the townhouse, retrieved the child and re-entered the home,"" Montgomery County Police said.

"Among the calls for justice in the Maryville, Missouri, rape case is one from a familiar Guy Fawkes mask-wearing face. Anonymous, the activist hacking collective that has instigated cyberattacks on such groups as the Church of Scientology and the Westboro Baptist Church, made a statement Tuesday regarding the case of Daisy Coleman, the high schooler who says she was raped by a local football player. The 2012 case is back in the news after a recent investigative report by the Kansas City Star raised questions about the way it was handled. ""We demand an immediate investigation into the handling by local authorities of Daisy's case,"" Anonymous said. ""We have heard Daisy's story far too often. We heard it from Steubenville, Halifax and Uttar Pradesh. ... If Maryville won't defend these young girls, if the police are too cowardly or corrupt to do their jobs, if justice system has abandoned them, then we will have to stand for them."" The statement closed with Anonymous' traditional tagline: ""We Are Anonymous. We Are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget."" Missouri prosecutor to seek special prosecutor in teen rape case . A rape case may seem like a strange cause for Anonymous, which is better known for defending Internet freedoms. But it's not the first time the group has gotten involved in high-profile episodes of of bullying or sexual assault. Last year, it posted information about the reputed tormenter of Amanda Todd, the Vancouver girl who committed suicide in 2012 after a topless photo of her led to teasing and abuse at school. Anonymous also threatened to reveal names of students involved in the 2012 Steubenville, Ohio, rape case involving a high school girl who was sexually assaulted by two high school football players. Witnesses to the crime talked about the incident on social media sites, sharing photographs and using degrading terms for the victim. CNN reached out to Anonymous for comment via a Twitter site affiliated with the collective but did not immediately receive a reply. The group sees itself as a defender of the defenseless. It was also active in spreading the word of the Occupy movement and making trouble for opponents. Who is Anonymous? Everyone and no one . ""Anonymous likens itself to the Air Force of the Occupy movement,"" CNN's Amber Lyon reported in 2012. ""When they see evidence of what they believe is police misbehavior, Anonymous strikes back, releasing personal information about specific officers."" Gabriella Coleman, a professor at McGill University in Montreal who's written extensively on Anonymous, says the group has gotten involved with rape cases only recently. ""Historically, Anonymous tended to get involved in censorship and social movements,"" she said. ""But because they have no mandates, there have been operations relating to any and every cause. If there's one that becomes particularly powerful -- and I would say that's what happened with Steubenville -- then it does become part of the repertoire of injustices they get involved in."" If there's a particular perceived injustice, the group is more driven to get involved, Coleman says. In the Maryville case, authorities dropped the charges against the athletes who had been implicated in the alleged rape. But, Coleman adds, there's also a bit of chance involved. She said Anonymous picked up on the Maryville case after a Twitter message was sent to an account affiliated with the group. It read, ""This is what happens when Anonymous doesn't get involved in a rape case,"" with a link to the Kansas City Star story. The fact that the case was essentially closed may have prodded the collective, she adds. ""Basically, it's case closed,"" she said. ""If it was an ongoing case, they would still maybe get involved, but it attracts more attention in a situation like this. There are still a lot of questions."" Maryville is the third rape case Anonymous has been part of in a year, she observes. Though Anonymous originated out of the website 4chan and initially took on activities for thrills, its focus has changed in the past few years, says Coleman. Now, operations tend to be politically motivated -- and there's even some backbiting if things get out of hand. For example, people involved in the Maryville project have been critical of the Steubenville operation ""because there was so much collateral damage,"" Coleman said. ""They do learn from previous operations,"" she said, though the nature of Anonymous is that its activities remain fluid. It's difficult to know whether Anonymous' demands have had any impact on the Maryville case. But Missouri Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder on Tuesday called for a grand jury review of the evidence.","Hacker collective is demanding an investigation into handling of Missouri rape case .

"The country is in your hands. That's what the speaker of Iraq's Parliament reportedly told Haider al-Abadi the day he was named to replace Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. A Shiite lawmaker then shook Abadi's hand. ""May God help you,"" he told him, according to The New York Times. He will likely need all the help he can get. Abadi will inherit the political reins of a country deeply divided along sectarian lines, a split that has aided a brutal campaign by extremist Sunni fighters with the  Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which refers to itself as the Islamic State. So who is the man that world leaders, diplomats and Iraqis hope can hold the country together? On paper, Abadi politically resembles the man he will replace. Like al-Maliki, he is a member of the Islamic Dawa Party, one of the country's biggest Shiite political blocs. Like the man he'll take over from, his power base is with Iraq's majority Shiites. And just like him, he was forced into exile by Saddam Hussein and he returned to Iraq after the Sunni dictator was toppled in the U.S.-led 2003 invasion. But that's where the similarities likely end. Abadi is viewed as a moderate and has shown more of a willingness to compromise than al-Maliki, Ranj Alaadin, an Iraqi specialist at Columbia University, told the BBC. ""He is very engaging, articulate and direct,"" Alaadin told the British network. Abadi was born in Baghdad in 1952, according to his website. A long-time member of the Dawa Party -- he is said to have joined as a teenager -- he was one of thousands of prominent Iraqis  who left the country during Saddam Hussein's rule. Abadi left to study abroad after receiving a bachelor's degree in 1975, and stayed away as Hussein tightened his grip on the country. Two of his brothers were not so lucky; they were executed in 1982 for belonging to the Dawa Party. The following year, the regime canceled Abadi's passport. Abadi spent many years in Britain, where he received a doctorate in electrical engineering at the University of Manchester. His father, who had been a prominent Iraqi official, was accused of insufficient loyalty to the regime and was forced to retire in 1979. He moved to Britain and lived there until his death. After Hussein was ousted, Abadi returned to Iraq in 2003 and became communications minister in the interim government, where his language skills and international contacts proved valuable. According to his biography, he was put in charge of ridding the northern Iraqi city of Tal Afar of al Qaeda in 2005, and successfully brought tribes together in doing so. It may prove to have been useful experience; Tal Afar is now under the control of ISIS. In interviews in recent weeks, he has stressed the need for unity and compromise in the face of a common enemy, saying all groups had been weakened in the face of the militant threat. He has argued fervently against the division of Iraq and said he is open to help from Iran, where many Dawa Party members lived in exile. Al-Maliki will continue to serve as the country's caretaker Prime Minister -- as well as its top military commander -- until Abadi forms a new government.

"(CNN)Even by ISIS' brutal standards, the video is horrific. Twenty-one Coptic Christians beheaded on a beach in Libya. Christians across the world expressed horror and outrage at the mass killing, with Pope Francis calling the victims ""martyrs"" whose violent deaths should unite the fractured Christian community. Remarkably, though, a leading Coptic Christian bishop says that he has already forgiven the ISIS soldiers who slaughtered his fellow Copts. Bishop Angaelos, head of the Coptic Orthodox Church in the United Kingdom, was in Washington on Friday for the swearing-in of the United States' new ambassador-at-large for religious freedom, David Saperstein. Angaelos spoke to CNN about why ISIS targets Coptic Christians, and why he forgives them, even as he rejects their horrific acts. Q: What was the first thing that came to your mind when you heard about ISIS killing the Coptic Christians? A: I suppose I had a sense of the inevitable happening. We knew that it was going to happen by the way ISIS was sending out information about the captives, parading them on video. It was all very orchestrated. It was shocking to see how that could happen today in the 21st century. But we also saw strength and bravery in those men, and the number of messages and calls we've received in solidarity, the condolences and support has been overwhelming. This crime is not just a crime against Coptic Christians. It is a crime against humanity, and if there's anything we should stand for as human beings, first and foremost it's the sanctity of all human life. Q: Not long after the video released, you tweeted about the killings, using the hashtag #FatherForgive. Did you mean that you forgive ISIS? A: Yes. It may seem unbelievable to some of your readers, but as a Christian and a Christian minister I have a responsibility to myself and to others to guide them down this path of forgiveness. We don't forgive the act because the act is heinous. But we do forgive the killers from the depths of our hearts. Otherwise, we would become consumed by anger and hatred. It becomes a spiral of violence that has no place in this world. Q: You and many others had publicly prayed for ISIS to release the Copts and yet they were killed in a brutal manner. How do you maintain faith in God or in prayer after such a horrific outcome? A: I learned a long time ago that when one prays, one prays for the best outcome, not knowing what that outcome would be. Of course, I prayed that they would be safe. But I also prayed that, when the moment came, they would have the peace and strength to be able to get through it. It doesn't change my view of God that these 21 men died in this way. They were sacrificed, but so much has come out of it. They brought the imminent dangers to marginalized peoples, not just Christians, but Yazidis and others in the Middle East, to the attention of the whole world. Q: This is not the first time ISIS had targeted Coptic Christians. Why do you think that is? A: They made accusations in the video that Coptic crusaders were forcing women to convert to Christianity, which is totally unfounded and untrue. Coptic Christians were not part of the original Crusades and are not part of any crusade now. We have lived peacefully and never taken up arms or forcibly converted anyone. But violent acts need to be justified and this is the justification they found. Q: You're in Washington today meeting with U.S. leaders. What should they do about ISIS' persecution of Christians and other religious communities? A: I would like to see us all start to work towards human rights generally, because when we're divided into different departments or organizations any change will be fragmented. If you look at the rights of every individual, God-given rights, we can all start to work together and safeguard any people who are persecuted anywhere. Of course, the vast majority of persecution falls squarely right now on Christians in the Middle East and that needs to be addressed. But, as a Christian, I will never be comfortable just safeguarding the rights of Christians. We need to help everyone.","Christians across the world express horror and outrage at the mass murder of 21 Christians .

"Condoleezza Rice, secretary of state under President George W. Bush, traveled 23 times to the Middle East in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to mediate an Israeli-Palestinian accord. Meanwhile, the Russians invaded Georgia. President Barack Obama's secretary of state, John Kerry, has shuttled 11 times to the region in search of the same elusive goal. And while American diplomacy was once again focused elsewhere, the Russians invaded  Ukraine. Now, in an effort to curb Russia, the United States is pausing from its efforts to forge an Israeli-Palestinian peace to generate international pressure on the Kremlin. But the pivot may prove impossible, as the issues of Russian expansionism and the stability of the Middle East remain dangerously intertwined. Late last year, Obama faced a daunting choice. Retaliate militarily for the use of chemical weapons by Syria and anger a war-weary American public or fail to enforce his own red line and severely damage his credibility. Either way, it seemed, Obama lost. Enter the Russians. As the unswerving supporter of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, Russian President Vladimir Putin alone had the leverage to mediate between Washington and Damascus. Through his cooperation, an arrangement was made for shipping al-Assad's chemical weapons abroad.  All sides claimed a victory. And while Syria has so far parted with only a small portion of its chemical arsenal, Obama still cites the agreement as a foreign policy triumph. That success could yet turn sour, however, if Russia backs out of the deal. In reprisal for punitive actions against Moscow, Putin could enable al-Assad to keep his chemical arms and quietly encourage him to use them. Vividly redrawn, Obama's red line would be flagrantly crossed. The American public would still oppose any military response, and America's enemies in the Middle East could revel in their newly affirmed impunity. Putin's ability to exploit the Syria civil war to weaken and embarrass the United States pales beside the damage he can inflict on America through Iran. Russian cooperation has been crucial to maintaining the unity of the permanent Security Council members and Germany -- collectively known by the mathematical name P5+1 -- in levying heavy sanctions on Iran and reaching an interim agreement on its nuclear program. Held up as an historic achievement by the Obama administration, both the sanctions and the nuclear agreement would be undermined by a Russian decision to pull out of the the P5+1 framework and embark on a separate course of unrestricted trade with Tehran. While pledging to keep ""all options on the table"" with Iran, the United States clearly wants to avoid the use of force. But stripped of all nonviolent alternatives, the U.S. would have to resort to military action to prevent Iran from getting the bomb. Whether in Syria or with Iran, Russia has played its relatively weak strategic hand exceedingly well and is threatening to outmaneuver the United States in the Middle East. Though no longer able to dispatch the great blue water fleet that once challenged American hegemony in the Eastern Mediterranean, Russia is once again asserting its influence in the region. And the reason is simple. While American policy has concentrated on the soft power of mediation --much of it fruitless -- Russia has invested in the hard power of military assistance and intervention. America has publicly warned that it may not be able to defend the Jewish state from international boycotts related to the peace process.  And Washington has disappointed Israelis and Arab Gulf states by easing sanctions on Iran and striking an interim agreement on its nuclear program. Russia, by contrast, stands staunchly behind Syria. America's allies worry whether they might stand alone. Russia's allies do not. The advantage, then, goes to Russia. The erosion can only be stopped -- and Russian expansionism checked -- by the reassertion of American preeminence.  One way to do that is to aid moderate Syrian rebels. Another way is to emphasize America's determination to stop Iran from going nuclear by all measures, diplomatic and military, irrespective of Russia's stand. And America must take steps to restore confidence in its dependability as an ally. This is not the first time that Middle East tensions have been linked to Russian ambitions in the Black Sea. Back in 1853, competition between Russia and the Western powers in Jerusalem triggered a war over Russia's control of the Crimea. Britain and France eventually stopped Russia, but only at an immense material and human cost. Today, conversely, the struggle over Crimea could further escalate Middle Eastern conflicts and lead to even greater violence. But that outcome can still be prevented -- not by war, but by reasserting tough American policies in the Middle East, protecting American power in the region and reassuring America's friends.","Michael Oren: While U.S. focused on mediation in Middle East, Russia acted in Crimea .

"(CNN)Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani has generated a firestorm by asserting, at a fundraiser for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, ""I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the President loves America."" Of course, that's nuts. Barack Obama's deep and true love for our country has been a hallmark of his career.  ""In no other country on Earth,"" he said when he was seeking the presidency, ""is my story even possible."" Obama said this, it should be noted, in his masterly speech on race -- an issue that is America's most difficult and tortured. If you can proudly assert your love of country in a speech addressing the legacy of what he called, ""America's original sin"" -- slavery -- you really love this country. But it got me to thinking: How do you show love of country? Sure, you fly the flag in front of your house -- as Obama does.  Perhaps you wear a flag pin on your lapel -- as Obama does. But love of country demands more than mere flag-waving.  Let me suggest the top 10 ways all of us can show we love America: . 10. Support a strong central government. The Articles of Confederation were a disaster. The U.S. Constitution was designed by men who wanted a strong central government so as to build unity, strengthen the economy and defend the homeland. 9. Be skeptical of too much centralized governmental power.  Inconsistent? Well, that tension is at the heart of the American experience. George Washington and Alexander Hamilton wanted national strength; Thomas Jefferson and James Madison did not. To truly love America is to hold both ideas in your head at once. 8. Embrace immigrants. The best day I had in 2014 was the day my eighth-grader was chosen to speak to hundreds of new Americans at their naturalization ceremony. The energy, idealism and unadulterated patriotism in that room was overwhelming.  True love of country was in the air; and tears were in my eyes. 7. Connect with a soldier or a veteran. Slapping on a bumper sticker that says ""Support Our Troops"" is fine. But the truth is, less than 1% of all Americans serve in uniform, protecting the other 99% of us. We civilians are far too separated from our military.  I say this as one who never served, but whose father, stepfather and father-in-law all served in the Army; whose cousins have served, and who has friends on active duty today. As a professor at Georgetown I have taught many outstanding young officers over the past 14 years. I have kept in touch with many: some are still in uniform -- they give me firsthand reports of the glory and the errors of today's military.  Others are in civilian life: they connect me to the ground-level challenges young veterans face, from the job market to navigating the VA.  If you really love your country, the least you can do is be able to name someone who is sacrificing for your freedom. 6. Take off the rose-colored glasses. One reason Barack Obama's race speech was so remarkable is that he did not sugarcoat the evils of racism, nor has he allowed it to poison his view of the greatness of America. When you know the history of slavery, KKK terrorism and segregation, it helps you appreciate how far we have come. Real love, mature and deep, only comes from intimate knowledge.  Ignorant, blind adoration is best left to teeny-boppers at a Justin Bieber concert, not true patriots. The goal is not ""My Country, Right or Wrong,"" but rather ""Love Your Country: Right its Wrongs."" 5. Travel around America. I have been in all 50 states. I had the privilege of visiting most of them with Bill Clinton. If you ever get the chance to fly a million miles with President Clinton, I highly recommend it.  Everywhere we went, we soaked up the local culture (and both of us inhaled the local cuisine). The lengthy, grueling presidential campaign gives our candidates a marrow-deep love for the wonderful diversity, the impossible breadth, and the miraculous unity of this country. 4. Then travel the world. The cliche is true: The more you see of the world, the more you love America.  Maybe one reason the Greatest Generation had such deep love for America is that they'd served their country overseas and seen the rest of the world at its worst.  At the same time, when you see other countries that are doing something better than we are; when you ride a highway in a Third World country that is smoother than your local interstate; when you see a successful European pre-K program, it makes you want to work to improve on those things at home. 3. Listen to someone you disagree with. Man, am I bad at this. But I try. I actually listen to Rush Limbaugh with some frequency. Sometimes I want to throw something at the dashboard, but other times I gain a perspective I lack. Besides, nothing is more American than a heartfelt political debate; and nothing is more boring than a vigorous agreement. 2. Inform yourself. Yes, the media is rife with faults, but we live in a time when technology empowers us to inform ourselves as never before. So, for example, before I jumped ugly over Sarah Palin's recent speech in Iowa, I got on my computer and actually watched the whole thing. Perhaps before they screamed about President Obama's speech at the National Prayer Breakfast, my conservative friends should have actually read it. If you truly love your country, get out of your media comfort zone (see #3 above), check out original sources, look up some history.  Arm yourself with facts if you want to really love your country. 1. Question your leaders in time of war. The greatest, most disastrous, most tragic governmental decision made in my lifetime was the Iraq War. Too many Americans, broken-hearted and justly vengeful after 9/11, meekly swallowed the Bush administration's line that Saddam Hussein was an imminent threat. Same thing with FDR's internment of Japanese-Americans in 1942. When your country is freaking out, when war fever is at its height, that is when questioning your leaders is the deepest display of patriotic love.","Paul Begala: Giuliani's questioning of Obama's love of country is nuts .
Still, he says, it's worth thinking about how we can all show we love the country.

"(CNN)Thursday night's final episode of ""Two and a Half Men"" marked the end of 12 turbulent seasons, and the show immediately addressed the elephant in the room: Would Charlie Sheen return? For the past four years, his character, Charlie Harper, has been dead as a doornail, but the finale showed us that Charlie's ""widow,"" Rose, had been keeping him in a pit in her basement all this time. That is, until Charlie escaped. As the hour unfolded, Alan (Jon Cryer) and Walden (Ashton Kutcher) discovered that Charlie was alive and coming for them to get revenge. Rose (Melanie Lynskey) explained (in a bizarre animated sequence) that Charlie's life had been saved at the last minute by a goat who jumped in front of the train meant for him, and she took him back to hold him hostage. Seemingly every character in the show's history -- and many exes, including one who was sleeping with John Stamos -- showed up as Alan and Walden tried to make amends on what they thought might be their last day alive. The pair  tried to get help from a police detective played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, who captured Charlie (though it turned out to be Christian Slater he'd caught). The two even got a visit from Alan's son, Jake, now married and living in Japan. Angus T. Jones, who played Jake, denounced the show a few years ago before leaving but returned for the finale. With a minute remaining in the show, Alan and Walden spotted a helicopter in the distance, carrying a piano belonging to Charlie. From behind, we saw Charlie come up to the front door, only to be crushed by the piano. Cut to the show's creator, Chuck Lorre, saying ""Winning!"" (Sheen's catchphrase during his troubled times) before he was crushed by a piano himself. It was a bizarre finale to say the least, almost reaching ""Newhart"" proportions. The fourth wall was broken so many times, it was demolished. Lorre anticipated that people would be disappointed by the lack of Sheen and explained in his vanity card that the actor was offered the chance to appear in the final scene to deliver a few lines before being crushed by the piano but refused. Sheen tweeted earlier that he was appearing on ""The Goldbergs"" but would never appear on ""Two and a Half Men"" again. Some fans were mightily disappointed, as the show had built up to an appearance by the character of  Charlie but failed to deliver. Many said on Twitter that the show was good up until that final scene, though others thought it lived up to its reputation.","The series ended after a turbulent 12 season run .

"The United States might extend a deadline to reach a comprehensive agreement on Iran's nuclear program, a senior State Department official told CNN. International negotiators in Vienna, Austria, are scrambling to reach a deal by Monday's deadline. ""It is only natural that less than 48 hours from the deadline we are discussing a range of options,"" the official said. ""An extension is one of those options."" Both sides appeared to be pointing to the possibility of yet another extension to the monthslong series of negotiations, whose final outcome is expected to have a lasting effect on Iran's relations with the West. U.S. President Barack Obama, asked about the deadline in an interview broadcast Sunday morning on ABC's ""This Week,"" didn't reject the idea. ""I think that what we're going to do is take a look at what emerges over the course of the weekend,"" he said. When asked if Congress would approve any agreement with Iran, Obama said, ""I'm confident that if we reach a deal that is verifiable and assures that Iran does not have breakout capacity, that not only can I persuade Congress, but I can persuade the American people that it's the right thing to do."" But media in Tehran were skeptical about the deadline. Based on the differences that remain between negotiators, and in light of the limited time remaining, reaching a deal by Monday ""would be impossible,"" the Iranian Students' News Agency reported Sunday, citing an unidentified Iranian official involved in the talks. 'Big gaps' U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who is in Vienna for the talks, said Saturday that ""big gaps"" remained between negotiators. A senior U.S. State Department official on Sunday referred back to those comments but told CNN that ""we are discussing the broad range of issues and we are continuing to take steps forward."" But the progress being made is only ""chipping away"" at the issues, the official cautioned. ""The focus of discussions remains on an agreement, but we are discussing both internally and with our partners a range of options for the best path forward,"" the official said. The negotiations are between Iran and the group known as the P5+1, consisting of Germany, the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will arrive in Vienna on Sunday evening to participate in the talks, Russia's state-run TASS news agency reported, citing a source in the Russian delegation. A deal could bring about an end to significant sanctions against Tehran and a warming of relations with the West. The absence of a deal would most likely ramp up tensions and could lead to more punitive measures -- and even confrontation -- over Iran's controversial nuclear program. Will Congress kill an Iran nuclear deal? Pressure on both sides . Iran insists that like other countries, it has a right to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes. But Western powers have accused it of trying to develop not just nuclear energy but nuclear weapons as well. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who is not part of the Vienna talks, said Thursday that Iranian authorities are continuing to deny his agency access to a sensitive military complex suspected of being a site of nuclear activities. Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani face domestic political pressure to strike a deal. An extension could sharpen opposition both in the U.S. and in Iran. Republicans take control of the U.S. Senate in January and lawmakers have threatened fresh sanctions on Iran if a deal is not reached. Although Obama has the power to veto, just the prospect of additional sanctions could drive Iran away from the table. Rouhani and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, the lead Iranian negotiator, are under fire from conservatives and lawmakers who were skeptical of the interim deal and have said a final agreement must be ratified by parliament. Earlier this month 200 Iranian members of parliament signed a statement demanding that Iranian negotiators ""vigorously defend"" the country's nuclear rights and ensure a ""total lifting of sanctions."" The senior U.S. State Department official told CNN on Sunday that the Iranians ""still have big decisions that need to be made.""

"(CNN) -- His name is synonymous with cinema. Egyptian actor Omar Sharif started his celebrated career in 1953 in the Egyptian-made film ""The Blazing Sun"". He made the move to the international screen in 1962 as Sharif Ali in ""Lawrence of Arabia"", a role which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Egyptian actor Omar Sharif tells MME films made today aren't as accomplished as those made in the early years of cinema . A Golden Globe award for Best Actor soon followed for his starring role in ""Doctor Zhivago"". At the age of 75, Omar Sharif is still making films. His latest, prehistoric epic ""10,000 BC"", opens worldwide in March. After more than 50 years in the film industry, MME's Schams Elwazer (SE)asked Omar Sharif whether anything had changed. Omar Sharif (OS): I think that film making has changed all over the world -- not only in the Middle East -- because the films reflect the society that we live in. The society has become more violent, there are more people living in the world, and people are having a hard time making a living, and also the audience of the films has become much younger. The old people don't go to the cinema anymore. SE: Some Hollywood films have recently come to the region to film here and also have begun to base some of their plots in the Middle East. How does Hollywood view the region as a place to do business? OS: It's a question of cost. It costs less to make films in the Middle East, for instance now Morocco has got a big studio in a place called Warzazat which I have made already 2 or 3 films there. They have everything, they have every facility. Tunis has already got a beautiful studio in Hammamet in which I made a film recently. They built a whole of ancient Rome there and you can go there and shoot films about ancient Rome without having to build a set or anything. SE: How would you characterize the health of the homegrown film industry in the region? OS: When I was younger, when I started in the Egyptian film industry, we used to produce about 120 films a year. Now we produce about 20 maximum, 15 to 20 films a year. First of all we used to be the only country that made Arab speaking films in all the Middle East. All the Arab speaking films came from Egypt. We were the Hollywood of the Middle East. Nowadays all the other countries are making films. Lebanon is making films, Syria is making films, Palestinians are making films. SE: You are the honorary President of the Cairo Film Festival which has recently wrapped up. Cairo Film Festival was the first and is the oldest in the region. But now we are seeing them pop up all over the place, from Dubai to Marrakech. What do you make of this trend? OS: You know every country wants a bit of publicity. You get people to come and it will encourage tourism. You know we do this for various reasons, we don't do it just for the art of cinema. SE: We are seeing a new emergence of arts and culture, or attempts at investing in arts and culture in the Middle East. Specifically in the Gulf countries such as Dubai, such as Abu Dhabi, such as Qatar. They're bringing in educational institutions like the Louvre, museums like the Guggenheim. How do you see these investments as benefiting the film industry in the future? OS: There are very few films that are like films used to be. So can you say that the film industry today is better than the film industry 50 years ago or 30 years ago? No. The films they made were masterpieces in those days. Where do you see masterpieces today? What films get the big prize at all the festivals? Do you know what Iranian films, Japanese films, Chinese films have? The most countries that have had the most prizes in the big festivals in Cannes in Venice, in everywhere, have been Chinese or Japanese or Indian or something. They are not American films anymore. Where do you see an American film getting a prize in Cannes film festival or the Venice film festival. I haven't seen one for ages now. Have your say. Email us at mme@cnn.com, or send an i-report.

"Israeli warplanes struck a military base near the Syrian port city of Latakia this week, an Obama administration official told CNN on Thursday. An explosion at a missile storage site in the area was reported in the Middle Eastern press, but an attack has not been confirmed by the Israeli government. The target, according to the Obama administration official, was missiles and related equipment the Israelis felt might be transferred to the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah. The official declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the information. There was some confusion about the timing of the attack, with some reports saying it happened Wednesday, and others saying Thursday. When asked for comment, an Israel Defense Forces spokeswoman told CNN: ""We don't refer to foreign reports."" Israel has been accused several other times this year of launching airstrikes inside Syria, including once in January. In the January incident, a U.S. official said Israeli fighter jets bombed a Syrian convoy suspected of moving weapons to Hezbollah. Israel's military did not comment on any of the allegations at the time, but has long said it would target any transfer of weapons to Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorists, as well as any effort to smuggle Syrian weapons into Lebanon that could threaten Israel. Thursday's reports of a blast come amid a Syrian civil war in which Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim militant group, has been helping Syrian government forces. Syria's government is led by President Bashar al-Assad, a member of the Shiite offshoot Alawite sect; the rebels and other militants fighting al-Assad's forces and Hezbollah are largely made up of Sunni Muslims. The Syrian conflict began in March 2011 after government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring movement and is now a full-blown civil war. The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people have died in the conflict. On Thursday, the Syrian military took back control of al Safira, a town that is believed to house a chemical weapons production facility. Rebels withdrew from the strategic town, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. International inspectors are trying to ensure that Syria eliminates its chemical weapons stockpile by the middle of next year. Syria agreed to the program under international pressure earlier this year. One of the monitoring groups, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, said Thursday that Syria has destroyed all its declared chemical weapons mixing, filling and production facilities, and all of the chemical weapons at inspected sites have been placed under seal. The watchdog body's announcement of the facilities' destruction meant that Syria met a key deadline in the elimination program. The joint United Nations-OPCW mission visited 21 out of 23 sites, an OPCW statement said, and 39 of the 41 facilities at those sites. The remaining two sites were too dangerous for the inspectors to go to, it said, but Syria had declared those sites abandoned. The chemical weapons equipment there was moved to other sites, which were inspected.","The Syrian military regains control of the town of al Safira .

"Seventy seconds: That's how long a North Carolina family says it took for things to go horribly wrong as they sought police help dealing with their mentally ill son. Keith Vidal, 18, died Sunday. According to CNN affiliate WECT, he was just shot 1 minute and 10 seconds after a third law enforcement officer showed up at his Brunswick County home. The three officers all were from different jurisdictions, and family members say that the third officer -- who came from a nearby city -- turned what had been an improving situation into an unnecessarily aggressive encounter that ended in their son's death. ""There was no reason to shoot this kid,"" the teen's stepfather, Mark Wilsey, told WECT on Monday. ""They killed my son in cold blood. We called for help, and they killed my son."" Although the state Bureau of Investigation is looking into the shooting, the chief prosecutor for the state's 13th Judicial District, which includes Brunswick County, says it's way too early to characterize what happened. ""I think that we can certainly understand why this family is upset right now,"" the Wilmington Star-News newspaper quoted District Attorney Jon David as saying. ""They just lost a child, and certainly my thoughts and prayers are with them. But what they want from this office today is justice, and I intend to give them exactly that."" CNN first learned of the shooting through an iReport sent by a family friend. The iReport received more than 50,000 views in 24 hours. The incident happened Sunday afternoon when the mother and stepfather of the Boiling Spring Lakes man called police. According to stepbrother Mark Ryan Wilsey, Vidal had schizophrenia and ""was having an episode,"" and his parents wanted police to subdue him so he could get help. ""He's not doing very good. You've got to get him someplace,"" a man who identified himself as Vidal's stepfather said on a 911 call, a copy of which was obtained by WECT. ""He wants to fight his mother. ... She's scared to death of him right now."" The caller said that Vidal ""won't take his medication"" and that his family has had ""to put him in before, (and) he's getting real bad again."" ""He's just, he's not right,"" he said. Two officers arrived and began talking with Vidal, according to CNN affiliate WWAY. The situation was relatively calm until a third officer -- a detective from the nearby city of Southport -- arrived, the family said. ""Everything was going good,"" Mark Wilsey said, according to WWAY. ""Then this fat cop from Southport walks in the room, walks around the corner, says, 'We don't have time for this. Tase that kid now. Let's get him out of here.' "" The stepfather said Vidal tried to run but was struck with two Taser charges and fell backward. He said the first two officers to respond got on top of Vidal. WECT attributed a slightly different accounting of events to Mark Wilsey. In that retelling, the stepfather said officers had pinned Vidal to the ground after he had been tased and one of the officers said, ""We don't have time for this"" and shot his stepson. Seventy seconds after the third officer arrived, WECT reported, citing police records, police radioed that they had had to shoot the teenager in self-defense. Mark Ryan Wilsey, who was not at the house but rushed there in an ""absolute panic"" and claimed that police restrained him, said his family is outraged by what happened and determined to get justice. ""We want the truth to be out there,"" he said. ""We don't want the good ole cops system to play out something that ain't the truth."" Authorities have not released the exact sequence of events, including how and by whom Vidal was shot. A Southport officer has been placed on paid administrative leave in connection with the shooting, Police Chief Jerry Dove said Tuesday. Authorities have declined to say whether he was the officer who shot Vidal. The Brunswick County sheriff's deputy sent to the scene has been ""cleared,"" office spokeswoman Emily Flax said. A review conducted by its Office of Professional Standards found that the deputy did not violate policy, Flax added. Boiling Spring Lakes Police Chief Brad Shirley said the same thing Tuesday of that department's officer, who was the first to arrive on the scene. The department said in a statement that, after an ""internal review,"" it concluded that the Boiling Spring Lakes police officer who responded did not violate department policy or state law. Neither the district attorney nor the state Bureau of Investigation returned messages seeking comment Tuesday. CNN iReporter Anthony Owens, whom Mark Ryan Wilsey described as a good friend of the family's, described Vidal as a slight young man who was never violent despite his mental illness. ""All he wanted to do was play drums,"" Owens said. ""He was so awesome."" The late teen's stepbrother said he did everything with Vidal -- hunting, fishing, sports and more -- describing him as a ""good kid."" ""He was my little buddy,"" Mark Ryan Wilsey said. Owens said the incident highlights the need for more understanding and awareness of mental illness. ""I was devastated by the news and am desperate to find some kind of good that could come from this horrible situation,"" Owens said. Mark Ryan Wilsey offered a similar sentiment, saying his family hopes to start a foundation to help the mentally ill like Vidal. ""We're uniting together, and we're going to make this go public,"" he said of the family's collaboration with Owens. ""Because the way my brother got treated ain't right.""","Spokeswoman says sheriff's office clears its deputy who was at the scene .

"(CNN)The list of canceled Bill Cosby shows has grown this month. Four shows the comedian had scheduled for February have been canceled: February 8 in Boston, February 21 in Pittsburgh and February 22 in Charlotte, North Carolina. No reasons were given for the Pittsburgh and Charlotte cancellations. Cosby said weather concerns led to the Boston cancellation, but the date has not been rescheduled. A fourth show, scheduled for Thalia Mara Hall in Jackson, Mississippi, on Thursday, has been ""postponed,"" Shelia Byrd of the Jackson Mayor's Office told CNN. Gary Bongiovanni, editor-in-chief of Pollstar -- the concert tour publication -- says it's been challenging to keep track. ""It seems like they're falling like dominoes, one at a time,"" he said. ""The whole thing has gotten a lot shorter than it was."" The concert cancellations are the latest complications for Cosby, who has been the subject of numerous sexual abuse allegations. The current tour, which began last fall, has felt reverberations from the allegations. Twenty-four women have spoken with CNN, have asserted their allegations on camera or in published accounts, or have been the subject of responses from Cosby's attorneys. CNN has not been able to independently confirm Cosby's accusers' allegations. While his attorneys denied the initial accusations, they haven't responded to more recent allegations, including the two newest ones in February. No charges have been filed against Cosby. Nevertheless, some venues have canceled Cosby's shows, including halls in Houston; Las Vegas; Tucson, Arizona; Yakima, Washington; Tarrytown, New York; and Durant, Oklahoma. Reasons have been terse: The Las Vegas show was canceled ""by mutual agreement,"" a representative said at the time, and Tarrytown said it had canceled two shows in consultation with the shows' promoter, according to a note from the venue. ""It's a dance that the promoter does with the venue and with Cosby himself,"" Bongiovanni said of the considerations that go into cancellation decisions. There might be contractual obligations, deposits and even -- given the demonstrators who have shown up at some venues -- concerns about public safety, he says. Cosby's Denver show draws protests . For example, at Cosby's London, Ontario, show, about 100 people came to protest the comedian. ""Why would you want to pay to see a rapist?"" demonstrator Milena LeDuc asked. Cosby was also heckled at two Canadian shows. However, though not selling out the halls, Cosby has received plenty of support as well. The London venue was about half-full, but the audience was said to be generally appreciative. ""I don't believe he's been charged with anything, and at least in this country, you're innocent until proven guilty,"" Bruce Maslen said, adding that the protesters and hecklers didn't spoil a thing. At his November show in Melbourne, Florida, Cosby received a standing ovation. Bongiovanni observes that, despite the bad publicity, Cosby's tour has been fairly successful. For the calendar year of 2014 -- which includes several months before the accusations went viral -- Pollstar's numbers show that Cosby's tour had $10.8 million in ticket sales over 101 shows. His ticket sales averaged about 2,200 per venue at about $57 each. In other words, not bad. ""His shows were selling OK. He's making great money at that sale level,"" Bongiovanni said. Cosby's website, billcosby.com, no longer lists tour stops, though a list can be found elsewhere on the Internet (including on Pollstar's website). The next scheduled concert is February 27 at Lafayette, Louisiana's, Heymann Performing Arts Center.

"Tens of thousands of radical Muslims marched toward the capital on Saturday to demand laws to target bloggers they said denigrated Islam and the Prophet Mohammed. The bloggers initiated a recent sit-in at Shahbagh Square demanding the death penalty for people involved in war crimes perpetrated more than four decades ago. Saturday's marchers termed them atheists who should be brought to justice for blasphemy. The sit-in protesters at Shahbagh Square demanded the ban on Jamaat-e-Islami, the largest Islamic party in Bangladesh, which opposed the independence of Bangladesh in 1971. Online activists who had a pioneering role in organizing the Shahbagh sit-in denied they were atheists. Muslim hard-liners under the banner of Hefazat-e-Islam on Saturday rallied against bloggers and authors. Meanwhile, some 25 liberal groups denounced the Hefazat rally and enforced a daylong general strike across Bangladesh, keeping capital Dhaka's communications cut off with the rest of the country on Saturday. The Hefazat rally was supported by the large opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its allies, including Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami. Earlier in February, a blogger was slain in Dhaka, reportedly for an anti-Islamic posting. Police last week detained four bloggers on charge of damaging religious sentiment. The Hefazat rally branded the government as cohorts of the atheists and said they wanted it to meet 13 demands, including reinstatement of ""absolute trust and faith in the Almighty Allah"" in the constitution and capital punishment for those who would denigrate Islam and its prophet. The demands included declaration of the Ahmadiyya Muslim sect as non-Muslim, a ban on free mixing of men and women, making Islamic education mandatory at all levels and no installation of any sculpture in any public place.

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN)A year ago Friday, violence in Kiev's Maidan, or Independence Square, reached a crescendo. Some 49 people died and close to 100 more suffered gunshot wounds in what was the bloodiest day of violence in demonstrations against the country's then Russian-leaning leader. Soon enough, however, President Viktor Yanukovych would flee the country, prompting Ukrainian activists to declare ""victory in the Maidan"" and promise a new day for a country long torn between its neighbors, Europe to the west and Russia to the east. How things have changed. Today, the country is a powder keg driving spiraling tensions between the West and Moscow.  A ceasefire between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists is in shambles. Debaltseve, a town at the heart of the battle, is devastated. ""Now, it is finally clear that we struggled on Maidan not against Yanukovych. He was just a cruel and obedient marionette,"" President Petro Poroshenko said Friday at a ceremony marking the one-year anniversary of the bloodshed. ""Moscow was preparing to the liquidation and tearing Ukraine apart long before the victory of Maidan. They were expecting the fall of Yanukovych and accelerated the course of events,"" Poroshenko said to the families of protesters who died a year ago. Poroshenko's speech was just part of a day of commemorations at the Kiev square. The ceremony was to feature music, poetry, the lighting of candles and finally a concert Friday evening. The President was to present awards to the families of activists who died. According to Ukrainian prosecutors, 77 people died during the 2014 protests, which were sparked by Yanukovych's decision to scrap a trade deal with the European Union and instead turn toward Russia. Forty-nine of those deaths came on February 20, 2014, when, according to protesters, government snipers opened fire on them. The street protests, which led to the ouster of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, triggered a chain of events that never could have been predicted. By March, Russia had annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula. Weeks later, in April, pro-Russian separatist forces launched their bid to carve off the more Russian-leaning eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions from the rest of Ukraine. Months of devastating fighting since have left nearly 5,700 people dead as of February 18, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reported Friday. More than 1 million people have been displaced, the United Nations says. Efforts to stop the fighting have met with limited success. The latest ceasefire agreement -- hammered out last week in Minsk, Belarus, among the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany -- has faltered amid the bloody battle for Debaltseve. Ukraine's National Defense and Security Council said there had been 300 instances of violation of the ceasefire since it came into force Sunday. Heavy shelling, apparently from both sides, was heard Thursday night in Donetsk, although it appeared to have eased Friday morning. A separatist news agency said one woman died in the barrage. Despite the spasms of violence, German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted that the Minsk deal was still the best chance for peace. ""It is difficult, it is slow and we had no illusions at all ... that it might not be all that easy and self-fulfilling,"" she said, speaking alongside French President François Hollande at a news conference in Paris. ""But I still believe that it is right that we do everything we can to make sure that no further lives are lost."" Western leaders have steadfastly accused Russia of failing to rein in separatists and of continuing to arm, supply and train them. European nations, the United States and others have imposed sanctions on Russian interests in hopes of applying pressure on Vladimir Putin to help end the hostilities. Russia denies claims by Kiev and the West that it has armed and equipped the rebels and sent Russian troops to fight with them. Merkel did not rule out potential for further sanctions on Moscow. But the aim of meeting in Minsk was to find a solution, not impose sanctions, she said. Merkel and Poroshenko spoke by phone Friday morning, and the German leader assured her Ukrainian counterpart of her support. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has observers on the ground tasked with monitoring the implementation of the ceasefire, has voiced concern about the lack of safe access to Debaltseve, which it blames on the separatists. A European diplomat told CNN that the OSCE mission is considering moving two of its four operational drones, currently stationed in Mariupol, to areas closer to Debaltseve since they have been unable to enter the town. A strongly worded report issued by a committee of the UK House of Lords said the European Union had underestimated the level of Russian animosity over moves to build closer EU-Ukraine ties and had been slow to ""adapt to the realities of the Russia we have today."" ""Russia is increasingly defining itself as separate from, and as a rival to, the EU,"" the report by the Lords' European Union Committee said. ""The EU's relationship with Russia has for too long been based on the optimistic premise that Russia has been on a trajectory towards becoming a democratic 'European' country. This has not been the case."" The report is also highly critical of the way in which competing national interests within the EU made it hard to achieve a united policy on Russia. If no progress is made in resolving the crisis, the EU should use sanctions to target people close to Putin, rather than mid-ranking officials in Crimea, the report said. It should also consider extending sanctions to the Russian financial sector. Meanwhile, as politicians talk, Ukraine's civilians are bearing the brunt of the conflict. In addition to the death and destruction, the United Nations says many Ukrainians have exhausted their savings and have no access to jobs or health care. Food prices have risen dramatically in the country's war-torn east -- 30% for staples such as bread and milk and 75% to 80% for meat and cheese, compared with last year. The United Nations said its agencies had taken advantage of the ceasefire to deliver 62 metric tons of humanitarian aid to the Donetsk region on Thursday, including winter clothes, blankets, drinking water and medical supplies. The U.N. World Food Programme announced that it would increase its assistance to more than 110,000 people, over the next few months. But the agency said it would need $9 million to continue to provide aid through June. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen reported from Kiev, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported from London. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Radina Gigova, Laura Perez Maestro and Michael Holmes contributed to this report.","Moscow planned move against Ukraine before protests, Ukraine's President says .

"The increased number of U.S. airstrikes against ISIS in the Syrian city of Kobani reflects more targets of opportunity, not a change in the campaign against the vicious Islamist group, a Pentagon spokesman said Thursday. The strikes are helping Kurdish fighters on the ground push back ISIS militants in the Syrian town, according to sources there. ""There's been no strategic shift here, as far as I know, at least from the military perspective, about Kobani or any other town,"" Rear Adm. John Kirby said, making a unique appearance at the State Department's daily briefing. In recent weeks, administration and U.S. defense officials have said it wasn't essential to keep the city, not far from the border with Turkey, from becoming the latest in Syria to fall into ISIS hands. ""We never said Kobani didn't matter,"" Kirby said. ""What makes Kobani matter for us from an airstrike perspective is that (ISIS is) there, and that they want it."" Kirby said the number of airstrikes in Syria or Iraq depends on how ""target rich"" an area is. The past few days around Kobani have seen more ISIS targets, he said. There are more ISIS fights there with more force, Kirby said. U.S. fighter jets conducted at least 14 raids near Kobani on Wednesday and Thursday, according to U.S. Central Command. Initial reports show the strikes hit 19 ISIS buildings and 10 other targets, including command posts, sniper positions and a staging location, the U.S. military said.  According to CNN's math, that makes 122 strikes on the city, most of any town in what the military recently labeled Operation Inherent Resolve. Street by street . The battle for Kobani has become a street fight over control of hills and neighborhoods and witnessed by TV cameras pointed there from Turkey. These strikes on small targets in Kobani, such as sniper positions, are ""tactical"" in nature -- without the widespread ""strategic"" affect against ISIS that U.S. officials have said is the foundation for the U.S. operation in Syria, a senior U.S. military official told CNN's Barbara Starr. ""It's not 'whack-a-mole,' "" Kirby said. ""The idea isn't to just put a warhead on a forehead every single day. The idea is to try to get at their ability to sustain themselves and to disrupt their strategy."" One Kurdish fighter told CNN Thursday that ISIS has been forced from many parts of the city, but still controls some key buildings including the hospital and the important Asayish building in the middle of Kobani, which served as headquarters for the Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG. Kurdish forces have control of the southwest entrance of the city and have taken some buildings back from ISIS fighters in one neighborhood, next to the heavily contested eastern industrial area of the city. The airstrikes over the past few days have helped Kurdish YPG fighters turn into an offensive rather than a defensive force, one activist said. But, he adds, ""there is still street fighting in the east and in the south"" of Kobani. ""This is an infantry battle now and traditional reconnaissance does not work,"" said Anthony Cordesman with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  It's hard to get correct information, making the results of the airstrikes indecisive, he said. A U.S. Defense officials told CNN that good weather played a role in the Kobani airstrikes, because the targets were readily located by overhead surveillance.  In Iraq on the other hand, bad weather has forced a slowdown in strikes, the official said. Joint Chiefs chairman: 'I don't see' Baghdad falling . ISIS pushing ahead in Iraq? Militants have tightened their  grip over an area about 15 miles south of Fallujah, an Anbar province official said Thursday. ISIS has brought many of its fighters, armed with heavy weaponry and machinery, in order to attack and control the town of Amiryat al-Falluja, the head of the town's council, Shaker Mahmoud, said Thusday. Mahmoud urged the Iraqi government to send military reinforcements to support the security forces inside the town. Obama on ISIS: Expect 'long-term campaign' ISIS advances have slowed and the group has changed formation, communication and tactics making them ""harder to hit,"" Kirby said.  He called for ""strategic patience"" in measuring the success of the operation. Militants continue to surround a major airbase in the Iraq's Anbar province and U.S. officials say they're continuing airstrikes there to help Iraqi forces. ""In Anbar province, our hope is to stop or halt that tactical initiative and momentum that they (ISIS) have,"" Gen. John Allen, the special presidential envoy on ISIS,  said Wednesday.  It is clear that ISIS ""has made substantial gains in Iraq,"" he said. A senior U.S. military official told CNN the fight in Anbar is ""very tough,"" but ""Iraqi forces are holding their own in some places.""

"August in Syria kicked off with an ammo depot blast killing 40 people, followed by news that U.N. inspectors were probing claims that regime forces had used chemical weapons. On Monday, U.N. inspectors were reportedly fired on by snipers while driving to investigate a new alleged chemical attack, one that has the U.S. moving warships closer to Syria and mulling military intervention. Yet to hear President Bashar al-Assad's Instagram account tell the story, it's been all about feeding the hungry, science Olympiads and widespread support for al-Assad and his wife. There are no ugly images of bloody battlefields in the brutal civil war. Instead, it's photo after photo of him and his wife being caring -- and lots of pictures of him being mobbed, greeted and hugged by adoring masses. The only mention of the war that has dominated headlines outside of Syria -- and has killed, according to U.N. estimates, more than 100,000 of al-Assad's countrymen -- comes in the captions beneath photos of the president shaking hands with soldiers ""protecting civilians"" and ""regaining security and stability"" in Darraya. The soldiers appear at ease and enthusiastic about al-Assad's visit, rather than in a state of war. That was August 1. The following day, the account featured file images of ""Captain"" Assad building camps and moving beds with his ""comrades"" in Syria in 1994, about six years before he took the country's helm from his father. The rest of the month, according to the account, has been packed with diplomatic functions, awards ceremonies, and his wife, Asma, tossing salad, stirring pots and filling bowls as Muslims broke fast in the evenings of the Ramadan holy month. Some of the president's almost 34,000 Instagram followers seem to sense spin in the postings, with one asking of the notoriously fashion-conscious first lady, ""So she managed to find time to stop shopping for shoes?"" and another demanding photos of her Christian Louboutins, the brand of posh, French shoes that can command upward of $1,000 a pair. Almost as common as the comments asserting, ""What a load of BS this account is"" are followers offering warm wishes of ""God bless you,"" ""We love you"" and ""We want you to win this war."" Some supporters have even employed a ""#LongLiveBasharAlAssad"" hashtag. The embattled president announced he was adding Instagram to his social media blitz last month via a message posted to his Twitter account. He began posting photos July 24. He also has his own Facebook page and a YouTube channel.","Syrian president's Instagram account filled with photos of him, first lady being caring .

"The fate of Syria's Western-backed opposition hangs on a knife edge in the northern part of the war-torn country -- and with radical Sunni militants and regime forces closing in on them from all sides, time may be running out. At least six villages north of Syria's largest city of Aleppo fell Wednesday to militants from ISIS, according to AFP. The jihadist group has seized large swathes of land in Iraq and consolidated control over considerable territory in northeastern Syria in the past year. ISIS fighters are now just 30 miles from the rebel-controlled northern suburbs of Aleppo and within striking distance of key opposition positions leading to the Turkish border. The situation for the opposition may be even worse inside Aleppo city, where forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad are gaining ground after a brutal months-long campaign against opposition forces. With the radical Sunni fighters bearing down on them from the north, and troops loyal to President Assad retaking Aleppo neighborhood by neighborhood from the south and west, Syria's beleaguered rebels are facing an existential threat. Since November 2013, the Syrian government has executed a concerted offensive on opposition-controlled areas of Aleppo city. Intensive and horrifically destructive barrel bombs have flattened the urban environment in which opposition insurgents had thrived, and forced thousands of civilians to flee. The military has followed air bombardment with methodical but effective ground incursions that, over time, have enabled it to re-capture territory and force a rebel retreat to the city's northern districts. As such, the opposition is now in its weakest position in Aleppo city since mid-2012. ISIS burst onto the scene in Syria in April 2013 and by December it had successfully established an expansive territorial presence across northern Syria, including in Aleppo governorate. But a sustained rebel offensive in January of this year forced ISIS to withdraw from the northwestern governorates of Latakia and Idlib and much of Aleppo, with the exception of three main towns in Aleppo's northeast: Al-Bab, Manbij and Jarablus. The rebels in Aleppo fighting to topple Assad and beat back ISIS' advance have long been a melting pot of different groups, including various Free Syrian Army (FSA) units,  the al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, and the Islamic Front (IF). While core moderate FSA-linked factions benefitted from an influx of Western support in late 2013 to facilitate their anti-ISIS offensive in January, this support has since dwindled. A principal Aleppo-based beneficiary of this support, Jaish al-Mujahideen, has since become a shadow of its former self. The U.S. has leaned heavily on Gulf states to reduce their support of Islamist and Salafist groups in Syria, which has damaged the IF's capacity to operate as a unified and effective coalition. In Aleppo specifically, IF's main group, Liwa al-Tawhid, has also suffered from debilitating internal divisions and defections. At the same time, the Assad regime's advances in Aleppo city and elsewhere have induced Jabhat al-Nusra -- a long-time ally of Syria's opposition, until recently -- to shift much of its resources west into Idlib governorate. As such, the principal defenders of areas of Aleppo still under opposition control today are a wide array of moderate FSA factions, some of whom still receive limited military support from the West, and members of the fading IF, most of whom are from the Aleppo area. These groups have borne the brunt of fighting ISIS while also facing a sustained Syrian military assault. Both of these offensives have combined to leave Aleppo critically vulnerable. But although regime advances in Aleppo city are extremely significant, the most immediate threat comes from ISIS and its rapid advance north of the city. Controlling Dabiq, one of the villages that AFP reported was seized Wednesday, is already extremely symbolic for ISIS, whose official magazine is named after the town for its role in the hadith -- the teachings, deeds, and sayings of the Prophet Mohammed -- as the site of a major battle before the end of the world. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who founded ISIS' precursor group, once said the capture of Dabiq would represent the first step towards conquering ""Constantinople"" and ""Rome."" With those villages in hand, ISIS now seems likely to move forward on two primary fronts -- northwest towards Sawran and eventually Azaz and southwest to Liwa al-Tawhid's stronghold in Marea. If ISIS moves on Sawran and then captured Azaz, it will cut rebels off from a critical supply line into Turkey via Bab al-Salamah and could arguably spell the end for an effective opposition in Aleppo. Losing Marea to ISIS would prove a crippling blow for Liwa al-Tawhid, whose founder and former leader Abdulqader Saleh was from the town. It would likely enable ISIS to continue towards Anadan and Hreitan, immediately north of opposition-controlled districts of Aleppo city, and cut off any remaining rebel forces there. Eventually, this would also open a route towards the former ISIS towns of Darat Izza and Al-Dana to the west in Idlib governorate, where ISIS could threaten what would then be the last remaining border crossing with Turkey at Bab al-Hawa. Late on Wednesday, while mosques in Marea issued calls for a general mobilization to defend against the expected ISIS assault, civilians and rebels stockpiled food and supplies in the case of a siege, according to people I spoke to in the town. What will ISIS do if, as now seems inevitable, it captures these towns? The group has named their Aleppo offensive ""Operation Revenge for the Women's Purity,"" a reference to allegations made by ISIS fighters that opposition groups had kidnapped and raped their wives during the anti-ISIS push in January. Such accusations would therefore seem likely to engender brutal acts of ISIS retribution in the coming days. There's no escaping the fact that the opposition's prospects in Aleppo look grim. While a 9-month-old U.S.-led strategy of uniting and arming core elements of the moderate opposition has demonstrated success in Idlib, it is far from certain that Aleppo can be saved. Moreover, if ISIS was eventually to succeed in threatening, or worse cutting off, both the Bab al-Salamah and Bab al-Hawa crossings with Turkey, the sustainability of a powerful moderate opposition in northern Syria would face an existential threat. The fate of Aleppo in the coming days, therefore, carries with it the future of Syria's military opposition in its fight against the Assad regime and an ever-expanding ISIS.","ISIS fighters reportedly seize villages just 30 miles from Aleppo, Syria's largest city .

"Washington (CNN)Divided on other issues, U.S. lawmakers united in support of Israel on Friday with the Senate approving another $225 million for the Iron Dome missile defense system. The House followed Friday night by voting 395-8 in favor of the measure. Senate approval came as the chamber wrapped up work before going on its five-week summer recess. The United States helped Israel create the missile defense system, which is credited with shooting down Hamas rockets in the current Gaza conflict. ""We could not go out for a month or five weeks and not act to help the Israelis replenish their supply of Iron Dome missiles,"" GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona told reporters. On Thursday night, Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma blocked the Iron Dome funding requested by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel because it would add to the budget deficit. McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina then spoke to Coburn -- a notorious fiscal conservative -- about the critical moment facing Israel, Graham said, adding that ""to his credit, he let it go."" With Coburn's objection gone, the measure passed swiftly by unanimous consent on Friday morning just as the latest attempt at a cease-fire in the Gaza conflict was disintegrating. Supporting Israel is a political necessity for many U.S. legislators, especially with congressional elections coming in November. McCain called for the House and President Barack Obama to now also approve the Iron Dome money in order to show the people of Israel that ""we will stand with them and that we will provide them with what they need in order to defend themselves.""

"The Syrian government has sent U.N. investigators the results of blood and soil testing from a mysterious attack that killed 25 people and injured more than 110 others, CNN affiliate ITN reported Sunday. Syria has claimed that rebels used chemical weapons in an attack Tuesday in Khan al-Asal in the northern province of Aleppo, according to state-run media. Opposition officials have said rebels don't have access to chemical weapons or the missiles needed to use them in an attack. Other rebel leaders have claimed Syrian troops fired ""chemical rockets"" at civilians and opposition forces. Syrian opposition leader steps down; Israeli troops face fire from Syria . U.S. President Barack Obama and other American officials have said in recent days there was no intelligence to substantiate reports that rebels used chemical weapons against government troops. And a U.S. military official directly familiar with preliminary intelligence analysis of the attack told CNN there were ""strong indications"" that no chemical weapon was used. The United States, in part, looked at video of the victims released by state-run television. Analysts believe it's possible people in the video were deliberately exposed to a caustic agent such as chlorine, the official said. But that would not be the same as using chemical weapons such as a nerve or blister agent. Syrian refugees flood Jordanian town . Sunday, ITN reported three unnamed Syrian medical or military officials said Damascus believes a small amount of chlorine mixed with saline and a homemade rocket were used. ""All sources we have spoken to say there is a pattern of victims suffering a variety of respiratory complaints from mild breathing difficulty, through fainting and vomiting to loss of consciousness and death,"" reporter Alex Thomson wrote on his blog. ""In most cases there were no signs of any conventional blast injuries in terms of external lacerations, burns or fractures, they say."" Victims' blood samples, soil samples and rocket debris were sent to the United Nations, he reported. Thomson wrote that the sources said the rocket was fired from an area that has been controlled by the radical Islamist group al-Nusra Front for ""some time."" The group is one of the most effective in the Syrian resistance, drawing on foreign fighters with combat experience in Iraq and elsewhere. In December, the U.S. State Department moved to blacklist the rebel group as a foreign terror organization linked to al Qaeda in Iraq. The Syrian government last week sent a written request to the U.N. for an investigation. The United Kingdom and France also put in requests. Jean Pascal Zanders, a chemical weapons expert and a senior research fellow for the  European Union Institute for Security Studies, cast doubt on the use of chlorine, saying in an e-mail that one small rocket couldn't deliver the quantity needed to kill 25 people. Chlorine isn't listed on any of the three lists of chemicals banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1997. ""It is no longer considered effective as a warfare agent, "" he wrote. Official: 'Something went down' in Syria, but it was short of chemical weapons . Thomson added that in war, both sides lie, but this ""is the most detailed account yet of what the Syrians believe happened."" Analysts believe the Syrian government may have one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons in the world. Specifically, the supply is believed to include sarin, mustard and VX gases, which are banned under international law. Syria has denied the allegation. The Chemical Weapons Convention prohibits the production, stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons. Syria is not one of the 188 signatories to the convention. In recent months, reports have repeatedly surfaced that Syrian forces moved some of the chemical weapons inventories, possibly because of deteriorating security in the country, raising fears the stockpile could fall into the hands of al Qaeda-linked groups working with the opposition should Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government fall.

"Alan Gross was in a Cuban prison Tuesday morning when his attorney, Scott Gilbert, phoned to say Gross would soon be released. There was a long pause. ""I'll believe it when I see it,"" Gross finally said, according to family spokeswoman Jill Zuckman. President Barack Obama's administration had secured Gross's release as part of a sweeping deal to thaw the decades-old diplomatic freeze with Cuba. Wednesday's announcement came after a year of secretive talks the two countries held in Canada, while Pope Francis was personally pressing the leaders of both countries to reach an agreement. The details of the behind-the-scenes maneuvering were so closely guarded that U.S. diplomats in Cuba threw a party at the official residence of Chief of Mission Jeff Delaurentis on Tuesday night to keep about 100 journalists, diplomats and other bigwigs -- including Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-N.Y.), sporting a white suit -- there distracted and drinking late. The White House, meanwhile, kept much of the Pentagon in the dark, according to several U.S. officials. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey and other top brass were told Tuesday that the trip would happen -- but the logistics of the journey unfolded much the same way that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper had recently departed on a secret mission to retrieve two Americans from North Korea. Moving quickly and quietly, the White House had gone straight to the 89th Airlift Wing at the Andrews Joint Air Base -- the group of military planes that includes Air Force One, and which the White House believes it controls, rather than the Pentagon --  with instructions to fly to Cuba. Gross's wife Judy, his attorney Gilbert, Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Pat Leahy (D-Vt.), Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and an Obama administration national security official arrived at Andrews in Wednesday's pre-dawn hours to board a plane headed for Havana. The group departed at 5 a.m. and landed in Cuba at 8 a.m. Gross was there waiting. The group spent about 30 minutes on the ground in Cuba before Gross boarded and found waiting for him a bowl of popcorn, which he had said he missed during his five years of captivity. Also waiting for him: a corned beef on rye sandwich with mustard. Tuesday night marked the start of Chanukah, so there were also potato pancakes (or latkes) with applesauce and sour cream, traditional holiday foods. At 8:45 a.m., the pilot announced that they were out of Cuban air space and would soon be entering U.S. airspace. Alan Gross stood. He took a deep breath. He called his daughter Shira in Tel Aviv and his daughter Nina in Oregon. ""I'm free,"" he told them. Obama called Gross and congratulated him on his freedom. Gross thanked him for getting him out of prison. It was a friendly call, Zuckman said. The plane landed at Andrews where other members of Congress awaited: Democratic Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois, Barbara Mikulski and Ben Cardin of Maryland and Carl Levin of Michigan, as well as Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.). While they all talked inside a building there, by coincidence, the plane of Secretary of State John Kerry landed at Andrews, Zuckman said. Kerry came from his plane to greet Gross, giving him a big hug. The two sat next to each other on a leather couch watching Obama announce the new Cuba policy. Then they all came to the downtown office building of Gross's lawyer where he delivered the prepared remarks carried on national television. Gross has a number of health issues and has lost about five teeth while in captivity. Zuckman said he is now focused on taking time to work on his health, visiting doctors and a dentist, as well as spending time with his family. When the three members of Congress were asked at a press conference on Capitol Hill Wednesday why they were picked to serve as the U.S. delegation to pick up Gross, Leahy joked that ""we had frequent flier miles."" The lawmakers said they'd learned recently that a deal was close. ""It was pretty clear over the last couple of weeks that something was finally coming together,"" Van Hollen said Wednesday. He said Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, called him earlier this week about the plan, but said there were ""a lot of logistics"" to work out. Two planes -- one to pick up Gross in Havana and one to deliver Cuban prisoners released by the United States -- ended up on the tarmac at the same time, Van Hollen said. Gross's wife was emotional on the plane ride to Havana, he said. ""She was tearing up and she asked for tissues before she went in [to greet her husband] and she needed them,"" Van Hollen said. Gross, who lived in Maryland, is a Van Hollen constituent who had gone door to door for Van Hollen's first campaign for Congress. Gross actually called Van Hollen on his cell phone from Cuba in October before the midterms to wish him luck in his re-election. ""Over time he was granted telephone privileges,"" Van Hollen said. He said the delegation met briefly with the Cuba's foreign minister when they landed in Havana, at a small airport near the city's much larger one. They were escorted by Cuban officials through the airport and into a room where Gross was waiting, along with two other American officials. Gross ""looks very frail but his spirits were high,"" Van Hollen said. ""He was clearly elated.""","The pre-dawn flight to Havana to retrieve Alan Gross was so secretive that much of the Pentagon was kept in the dark .

"(CNN)Hayat Boumeddiene seemed kind and polite, always wearing a veil and often motoring around on a scooter with her romantic partner, Amedy Coulibaly, a neighbor in a southern Paris suburb recalls. Now the 26-year-old Boumeddiene is the subject of an international dragnet after Coulibaly -- said to be linked to two brothers suspected in the Charlie Hebdo massacre -- killed hostages at a Paris kosher supermarket Friday before police fatally shot him. Police earlier named Boumeddiene and Coulibaly as suspects in Thursday's slaying of a female police officer in the southern suburb of Montrouge. With Coulibaly dead, and Charlie Hebdo suspects Cherif and Said Kouachi killed Friday in a separate standoff north of Paris, Boumeddiene is the last prime, publicly identified suspect that police are seeking in connection with France's recent wave of terror attacks. A Turkish Prime Ministry source told CNN that Boumeddiene entered Turkey on January 2, arriving at the Istanbul airport on a flight from Madrid with a man. That means she may not have been in France at the time the policewoman was shot on Thursday, as authorities originally believed. Authorities offered no immediate explanation of the discrepancy, but have said she is wanted in connection with a terrorist attack. During routine screening of arriving passengers, Boumeddiene and her companion were flagged by Turkey's Risk Assessment Center at the airport and a decision was made to maintain surveillance on their movements. The pair checked into a hotel in Istanbul and engaged in ""tourist type"" activity for a couple of days. When her name was made public by French investigators after the Paris terror attacks, Turkish authorities alerted their French counterparts to her movements. Turkish agents tracked her to what the official said was her last confirmed location near the Syrian border. She had a return ticket to Madrid for January 9, but she failed to take her return flight from Istanbul that day, according to an official in the office of Turkey's Prime Minister. A French source close to the nation's security services said it's believed that Boumeddiene is no longer in France and she is thought to have left for Turkey, ""of course to reach Syria."" French authorities have asked Spain to look into the possibility that Boumeddiene transited through Spain en route to Turkey, a Spanish source close to the nation's security services said. It is not confirmed that she did travel through Spain, but ""it is true that we are working on that line of investigation, on that possibility,"" the source said. Earlier, French police union spokesman Pascal Disant said Boumeddiene may have left the market siege and eluded capture as hostages were freed. So far, no witness has publicly said she was there. But Disant said that the Kouachi brothers and Coulibaly were part of the same jihadist groups, and Paris prosecutor Francois Molins indicated Boumedienne and Cherif Kouachi's wife also were well acquainted, saying they exchanged 500 phone calls in 2014. Armed investigators on Saturday milled around the apartment shared by Coulibaly and Boumeddiene in Fontenay-aux-Roses, south of Paris. Both of their names were still on a letterbox in the lobby of the building, situated across from a library. They lived in an apartment above an Indian restaurant for about five years, according to a neighbor who spoke on condition of anonymity. The neighbor said the couple were always polite, and she often saw them drive around the neighborhood together on a scooter. As far as the neighbor could remember, Boumeddiene always wore a niqab, a veil that some Islamic women wear to cover all of their head and face except for the eyes. The French newspaper Le Parisien reported that Boumeddiene was one of seven siblings hailing from Villiers-sur-Marne, France. Her mother died in 1994, and at age 8 or 9 she and some of her other siblings were put into foster care when her father struggled to raise them alone, Le Parisien reported. The paper reported that Boumeddiene ""religiously wedded"" Coulibaly in 2009. The next year, Coulibaly and Cherif Kouachi were involved in a 2010 attempt to free an Algerian serving time for a 1995 subway bombing, a Western intelligence source told CNN. Coulibaly was indicted May 22, 2010, and spent time in prison in connection with the prison break plot. Cherif Kouachi was under investigation for the same plot, but there was not enough evidence to indict him, the source said. Photos published by the French newspaper Le Monde purport to show Boumeddiene in 2010 in a rural setting, wearing a niqab and an abaya -- a loose garment covering the rest of her body -- and holding a weapon that appears to be a crossbow. Another photo shows her pointing the weapon at the camera, but her face is obscured by the niqab, with only her eyes exposed. CNN has not independently confirmed the authenticity of the photos. In one of the photos, Boumeddiene in a niqab is posing nearly cheek to cheek with Coulibaly in what the newspaper called a selfie. Coulibaly holds a pistol in a firing pose in another photo. In another, Boumeddiene is kneeling and readies to fire the crossbow-like weapon. In that photo, her face and hands are exposed, but her face can only be seen in profile. CNN's Gul Tuysuz and Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this report.","Hayat Boumeddiene, alleged accomplice of Amedy Coulibaly, entered Turkey, source says .

"London (CNN)UK police appealed for help Friday to find three teenage girls who are missing from their homes in London and are believed to be making their way to Syria. The girls, two of them 15 and one 16, have not been seen since Tuesday, when, police say, they took a flight to Istanbul. One has been named as Shamima Begum, 15, who may be traveling under the name of 17-year-old Aklima Begum, and a second as Kadiza Sultana, 16. The third girl has not been named at the request of her family, police said. Pictures released by police show the three girls walking together through London Gatwick Airport, carrying travel bags. They are said to be close friends who went to the same east London school. Richard Walton, of Counter Terrorism Command, said: ""We are extremely concerned for the safety of these young girls and would urge anyone with information to come forward and speak to police. Our priority is the safe return of these girls to their families. ""We are reaching out to the girls using the Turkish media and social media in the hope that Shamima, Kadiza and their friend hear our messages, hear our concerns for their safety and have the courage to return now, back to their families who are so worried about them."" UK police are concerned about the number of girls and young women trying to head to areas of Syria controlled by ISIS, Walton said. ""It is an extremely dangerous place and we have seen reports of what life is like for them and how restricted their lives become,"" he said. Besides being forced to lead a very limited life in Syria, he said, they often are denied the choice of returning home, leaving few options for their devastated families. However, if the three missing girls can be found while still in Turkey, there's a good chance they could still be brought home safely, he said. A police statement urged anyone who thinks a family member might be planning to go to Syria to get in touch. ""This is not about criminalising people it is about preventing tragedies by offering support to the young and vulnerable,"" it added. If the girls are headed to Syria, they would not be the first to attempt the journey. In October, three teenage girls from Colorado were intercepted at Frankfurt Airport in Germany as they were trying to make their way to Syria to join ISIS. Their parents tipped off the FBI when they went missing. Another Colorado resident, 19-year-old Shannon Maureen Conley, was arrested at Denver International Airport before she departed on her journey to join an ISIS camp near the Turkish-Syrian border. She planned to marry a member of ISIS whom she had met online. She was given a four-year prison sentence last month after admitting wanting to become an ISIS bride and participate in its jihad in the Mideast.

"(CNN) -- Sriram Hathwar and Ansun Sujoe correctly spelled so many words Thursday that the Scripps National Spelling Bee had to declare them both winners. Why? Because there weren't enough words left on the competition's list for them to keep facing off until only one was left standing. In the bee's final round, Hathwar, 14, an eighth-grader from Painted Post, New York, correctly spelled the word ""stichomythia"" -- dialogue especially of altercation delivered by two actors. Sujoe, 13, a seventh-grader from Fort Worth, Texas, correctly spelled the word ""feuilleton"" -- part of a European newspaper. It's the first time the bee has ended in a tie in more than 50 years. The last time there were co-champions was in 1962, organizers said. Ties also ended the bees in 1950 and 1957. ""It feels pretty good because not only do I get the victory, but I get to share it with someone else, so it means a lot to me,"" Sujoe told CNN's ""New Day"" on Friday. Hathwar called the English language ""brutal"" because it incorporates words from other cultures and languages. ""So it was really a competition against the dictionary, and not against Ansun or any of the other competitors,"" he told CNN. The two quickly garnered praise from high office, with President Barack Obama tweeting his kudos: ""Congrats to Ansun and Sriram, the incredible co-champs of the #ScrippsNationalSpellingBee. You make us all proud! -bo"" In this year's national championship, 281 spellers from eight countries competed for the title. The contest started Tuesday and finished Thursday night with the finals broadcast live on ESPN. Sujoe told ESPN that he got hooked on the bee by watching it on television. In addition to spelling, he has perfect pitch and plays piano, bassoon and guitar. ""I was pretty happy when I made the finals, and now I'm even happier that I'm a co-champion,"" Sujoe said. Hathwar, who placed third in last year's competition and first made it to the National Spelling Bee as a second-grader in 2008, was a favorite to win this year's contest. The youngest competitor this year was 8. And the oldest was 15, organizers said. Even students who didn't walk away with a trophy seemed excited about their next steps. Tejas Muthusamy, 11, said he'd return home ready to change his studying routine for future competitions. ""Now I'll prepare more for the finals, and try to go through more esoteric words,"" Muthusamy said, minutes after misspelling ""hallenkirche"" got him kicked out of the competition. Eighth-grader Kate Miller, who struck out in the finals when she misspelled the world ""exochorion,"" said there's a lot she'll be bringing back to Abilene, Texas. ""I will take home with me a suitcase full of happy memories, great friends and a true feeling of acceptance,"" she told ESPN. And she didn't hesitate when asked what her next move would be. ""I don't need to study spelling anymore, and I don't really need to sleep anymore,"" she said.

"Stephenville, Texas (CNN)The defense rested its case Thursday in the trial of the man accused of killing Chris Kyle, subject of the hit film ""American Sniper,"" and Kyle's friend at a Texas firing range two years ago. No one disputes that Eddie Ray Routh shot and killed the two men. But defense attorneys say Routh was insane. They called to testify a psychiatrist, who assessed Routh after the supposed murders. The doctor told the jury that Routh acted delusional. Routh apparently believed his co-workers were cannibals, his neighbor was dealing drugs for the Mexican mafia and that Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield, were ""hybrid pig people,"" Mitchell Dunn, the psychiatrist, testified. ""It is my opinion that he was suffering from a severe mental disease or defect that caused him not to know his conduct was wrong,"" he said. However, Dunn also testified that Routh told him: ""As soon as I did it, I realized I made a mistake,"" in an apparent reference to shooting Kyle and Littlefield. The psychiatrist said that Routh had been hospitalized at least four times for mental health issues. Routh is not planning to take the stand in his own defense. His trial comes just weeks after the release of the film about Kyle, a former Navy SEAL who claimed to be the deadliest sniper in U.S. history, with 160 confirmed kills in Iraq. ""American Sniper,"" directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Bradley Cooper, has grossed the most ever for a war movie. Kyle's autobiography by the same name spent weeks on best-seller lists. He had already risen to fame through his book when he died and was involved in charitable work to help former troops suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Kyle and Littlefield took Routh to the firing range as a kind of therapy. The range is a small, remote part of the sprawling 11,000-acre Rough Creek Lodge, and the men were isolated. A hunting guide found Kyle, 38, and Littlefield, 35, Kyle's friend, motionless and called 911. The men were dead when officers arrived. Who is Eddie Ray Routh? Correction: Earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of Chad Littlefield, who was killed with Chris Kyle. Littlefield was not a veteran. Tristan Smith and Chris Lett reported from Stephenville, Texas. Dana Ford reported and wrote from Atlanta.","Eddie Ray Routh is on trial in the shooting deaths of Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield .

"(CNN)Bruce Gilden was tired. He's 68, and he had just returned to New York from an assignment in South Africa. Next up were England, Hong Kong, Tokyo. Some assignments, some locations, are better than others. In a surprisingly warm stretch of October, the photographer shot an assignment in Brighton Beach, a neighborhood not terribly far from his apartment in Manhattan. He liked that. He could spend four days there but go home at night to see his wife and pet his cats. He knows the place well, too. He grew up in Brooklyn and Queens and spent years shooting around Coney Island. This stretch of Brooklyn has changed since then, as all things do, but it's still special, still a beloved place to dip a toe in the Atlantic. It maintained its individuality, Gilden says. It's not like where he lives -- the same rent-stabilized apartment in SoHo where he has stayed for decades. It changed around him into people who all seem to dress and act the same. ""Here, a guy gets a job on Wall Street, where's the struggle?"" Gilden said. ""I'm not interested, visually."" But Brighton Beach is something else. His wife loves to go there to swim, or buy tchotchkes and fancy mustard. If he had to pick a location for a fashion shoot, it'd be there. The neighborhood was pretty Russian all those years ago. Now, he says, it's all Russian. Jewish and Ukrainian, too, but really Russian. He can't read the signs. You ask the time, and folks will show you their watch rather than say the words. Last October, he brought a translator along because so few people speak English -- or at least, he says, they pretend they don't. He wandered the streets below the elevated train with a small Leica camera, and he snapped photos when he spotted a character. It's not too crowded, and most people were very nice. Some wanted to take his head off. After years of shooting gangsters, revelers and whoever happens to be out and about, it all unfolds so quickly that almost nobody makes a fuss, he says. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. ""I have very good bedside manner from all the years on the streets,"" Gilden said. ""It's like playing sports. You don't have time to think. You act and react. ""I shoot what's interesting. All I'm about is visual."" And Brighton Beach is a sight. For decades, Gilden shot in black and white. For the last two years, he says, he sees in color. Brighton Beach has it all -- wild prints on shirts and dresses, fluorescent bathing suits that don't exactly fit, garish makeup that's been lovingly applied the same way for 50 years. ""I shoot who I am,"" Gilden said. ""And I shoot what interests me, even when people hire me. I'll get the job done, but I have a lot of energy in my pictures. With those people, there's a lot of energy. They're shopping, shopping, shopping. They go with their carts, and their red lipstick and their bright clothes."" Brighton Beach? Sure, it's close to home. But, Gilden says, ""it's an assignment that I liked."" Bruce Gilden is a street photographer based in New York.

"A vehicle explodes. Two trucks full of armed men race closer to the resulting crater at the Karm el-Kawadees army camp in North Sinai. The black-clad militants chase the survivors, killing all the soldiers. All of it is captured on video. At least 31 Egyptian soldiers were killed in the October attack, the deadliest to date committed by the Sinai-based militant group Ansar Beit al-Maqdis (Champions of Jerusalem). ABM militants released video of the ambush in mid-November -- just days after pledging allegiance to ISIS, the Islamic terror group that now controls large parts of Syria and Iraq. The footage, which also shows a number of drive-by shootings and roadside bomb blasts, suggests that the group's firepower and strategic planning is becoming more sophisticated. ABM operates primarily in Northern Sinai, an area where rolling sand dunes butt up against the Mediterranean Sea and stretch to rocky mountains in the center of the Sinai Peninsula. For years this corner has been dubbed ""the most dangerous part of Egypt."" Since 2011, the group has been attacking Israeli interests in Sinai by repeatedly blowing up a gas pipeline leading from the Egyptian Red Sea to Israel. The group stepped up the frequency of its raids after Egypt's army overthrew President Mohamed Morsy -- a former Muslim Brotherhood leader -- following a popular uprising in July 2013. Hundreds of Egyptian troops have since been slaughtered in this low-level insurgency. In the two months leading up to the October 24 massacre at Karm el-Kawadees, the group more than doubled its attacks in North Sinai -- killing 62 police officers and soldiers, according to Aswat Masriya, an Egyptian Reuters affiliate. While looting weapons from Karm el-Kawadees, a militant proclaimed to the camera: ""Tell the leader of ISIS, [Abu Bakr] al-Baghdadi, the leader of the faithful, that you are coming here and we are your soldiers."" The group has changed its logo and its name to Wilayat Sinai -- ""the State of Sinai"" -- positioning itself as part of the bigger ISIS ""caliphate"" that extends from northern Syria to central Iraq. Several other militant groups from the region have also pledged allegiance to ISIS, including in Libya, which shares a long porous border with Egypt that is known for being an arms-smuggling route. These pledges benefit ISIS, whose territorial expansions have already peaked and are now stagnant, explains H. A. Hellyer, from the Center of Middle East Policy at Brookings Institution. ""It may well be very possible that ABM decided that in order for it to maintain its own type of momentum, to become part of a broader transnational group, would be in its own interest,"" Hellyer told CNN. Observers note the scarcity of verified information coming from Sinai; the military limits access to the wild terrain believed to be the group's home and the surrounding towns and villages. Most concerns about ABM's recent pledge of allegiance to ISIS are focused on the possible increase in recruitment and expertise. ""First thing it means is that any Egyptians currently fighting with ISIS and Daesh in Syria or Iraq have a second arena to go and fight in without leaving the group,"" Hellyer said. ""They'll add that expertise, they'll add that training to the capacity of [ABM]."" Unlike ISIS, Ansar Beit al-Maqdis mostly refrains from targeting civilians. The group has almost exclusively attacked the government, aside from one recent ABM video purporting to show the beheading of four civilian men who were accused of spying for Israel. In a video claiming responsibility for the attempted assassination in 2013 of Egypt's Minister of Interior, ABM said it chose the site of the suicide bombing to minimize Muslim civilian casualties. It pits itself as a defender of the people against what it calls the ""apostate"" army. Its statements often cite videos of Egypt's army attacking protesters in 2011, the killing of more than one thousand Morsy supporters in August 2013 and, most recently, a leaked video of Egyptian soldiers torturing two Sinai Bedouins. ABM also cites pictures of militants killed by security forces in Sinai as further proof of abuses. ""You all saw what [security forces] did to Muslims in Egypt and in all squares. This army has crossed all lines. This army did what the Pharaoh didn't do with his people,"" warns an unidentifiable militant in one ABM video. ""We will kill you all, you apostates."" Sitting in front of a cache of weapons supposedly taken from the Karm el-Kawadees camp, ABM's presumed leader said he would free the ""prisoners of war"" held by authorities. ""We told you before, the war hasn't started yet. And what's coming is worse and bitter. This is only the beginning. You opened a door you won't be able to close,"" he said, clad in black clothing with his face blurred. Following the October attack, the government ordered the evacuation of houses along the Egypt-Gaza border, creating a one-kilometer-wide buffer zone, in a bid to curtail smuggling of arms through the Gaza tunnels. In a video showcasing its capabilities under the banner of ""a fierce military operation to purge Sinai from the grip of terrorism and criminals"", Egypt's army also included interviews with evacuees assuring the public that they did so willingly and received proper compensations. The residents of northern Sinai have long complained of being neglected by Cairo. The lack of job opportunities and development -- along with a general mistrust between Bedouin peoples and the government -- has created fertile ground for the rise of ABM. ""This is collective punishment by the army and the police,"" said Sherif Mohy El-Din, a counter-terrorism researcher at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. ""The army has been destroying houses of the people and burning their cars and motorcycles for the past two years."" Terrorist attacks have only increased as the government has stepped up operations since July 2013, observed Mohy El-Din, who argues that the that the narrow focus on security is counterproductive and is only making the situation worse. ""It's very complicated. It has a lot of dimensions, economic and political. We are dealing with a regime that since July 2013 has been saying 'It's me and only me, no parliament or elections,'"" said Mohy El-Din. Opening the public sphere for competing viewpoints, he argued, would help curb terrorism. But defeating ABM will take more than establishing security. Mohy El-Din says the government first needs to improve the lives of the civilians in the area. In the meantime, ABM is no longer confined to Sinai. It has launched attacks in the Nile Delta, in Cairo, and against Israel -- the group's original enemy. In Cairo, observers worry that the heavy hand of security services in cracking down on dissent is fueling the violence. It provides grounds for recruitment for groups like ABM and is reflected in the spike in number of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) defused or detonated in the Nile Valley. ABM has only claimed responsibility for a few of these attacks. But despite the rise in number and sophistication of attacks, Mohy El-Din believes Egypt is safe for tourists and civilians -- at least for now. ""Now, ABM is not targeting civilians,"" he told CNN. ""But if it gets worse and they don't see hope, then maybe."" The government sees the threat within a regional context. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has expressed support for the global war on ISIS. And at home, he remains resolute. ""They assume that we are incapable of confronting them. They started the fire. We were very careful that no blood is shed. But unfortunately, they wanted the exact opposite,"" the former defense minister, elected president last summer, said 10 days after the October attack. El-Sisi said he wasn't shaken by the attack -- and refused to direct his anger at military leadership, as some voices critical of security failures have called for. He ridiculed ABM's attempts to create an ""emirate"" out of Sinai, pledging that no one would crack the enduring unity of Egypt. It's impossible for ABM to eliminate the Arab world's largest military. Yet until there is a victor, the death toll will continue to rise. As the group declared in one video, it seems more determined than ever to expand: ""We will eliminate borders. No passports, no visas and no borders. It's not just about Sinai.""","Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, one of Egypt's most violent militant groups, has pledged allegiance to ISIS .

"(CNN)Vincenzo Nibali's defense of his Tour de France crown is in doubt after the UCI requested Friday that the Italian's Astana team has its WorldTour license withdrawn. Five Astana riders from the Kazakhstan-based team have been caught doping since last August and as a result it had only been granted a provisional license for the 2015 season. The world governing body said in a statement that an audit of the team, carried out by the Institute of Sport Sciences at the University of Lausanne (ISSUL), had given them ""compelling grounds"" to make its decision. ""The UCI considers that the ISSUL audit has, among other things, revealed a big difference between the policies and structures that the team presented to the Licence Commission in December and the reality on the ground,"" it said. Astana has also been caught up in the Padova investigation by Italian police into links between professional cyclists and banned doctor Michele Ferrari, who was Lance Armstrong's personal trainer. The UCI revealed Friday that some of the evidence it had been provided with by the Italian authorities ""concerns Astana Pro Team members"" and this will also be passed on to its License Commission, which is an independent four-man body, headed by a Swiss judge. Astana has still to make a formal response to the UCI decision, but if it is stripped of its license to race at the highest level of professional cycling it would be a serious blow to Nibali and other star riders like Italian Fabio Aru. A WorldTour license gives an automatic passport to the top races in cycling like the Tour de France, the Giro d'italia and the Vuelta a Espana, plus one-day classics such as Paris-Roubaix and Milan-San Remo. Nibali -- who has never failed a drugs test -- would be forced to switch to another team if he wants to compete, assuming his current contract with  Astana has a get out clause. The 30-year-old Nibali captured the coveted yellow jersey of the Tour de France last July -- succeeding Team Sky's Chris Froome, who crashed out in the early stages of the 2014 edition. Astana, the team self-confessed drugs cheat Armstrong chose to ride for in his 2009 comeback, has a controversial past and is headed by Kazakh Alexander Vinokourov, who served a two-year ban after being caught doping at the 2007 Tour de France. The latest scandals involved brothers Maxim and Valentin Iglinskiy, who were caught using the blood-booster (EPO), while three riders from its development squad also failed drugs tests. It led to widespread calls for the UCI, under the new leadership of Briton Brian Cookson, to take firm action and Astana was only granted its temporary license under condition that its management and anti-doping policies would face further scrutiny. Back in 2012, the UCI stripped Katusha of its WorldTour license, but the Russian-based team successfully appealed to the Court of Arbitration in Sport to be reinstated.","UCI wants Astana's WorldTour license withdrawn .

"This week, we've been treated to the increasingly familiar sight of former NBA star and provocateur Dennis Rodman attending events in Pyongyang, North Korea.  It's his fourth trip in less than 12 months. On Tuesday, an angry Rodman defended his visit in a CNN interview straight from Pyongyang, at one point saying to ""New Day"" anchor Chris Cuomo, ""I don't give a rat's ass what the hell you think ..."" in response to question about Kenneth Bae, an American detained in North Korea. When will we tire of this circus? In case you don't watch cable news, you might miss that the media really loves this kind of thing. No story about North Korea is too weird to go unreported, even if there is no real information to disseminate. Recall the recent rumor that Kim Jong Un's uncle was executed by being fed to hungry dogs, which most likely was started as satire on Chinese social media but was at first reported widely in the media (CNN was unable to confirm and did not report the story). In media discourse, North Korea is the classic enemy. The regime's injustices, quirks and dysfunctions are reassuring to Americans that their own country is just the opposite: Normal, well-functioning, a land of peace and liberty. But add in Rodman to the North Korea story, and it's bound to produce eye-popping headlines: The Weird American Athlete Goes to Weird Country story is just too easy not to cover. Rodman himself seems to be thriving on finding a strange smidgen of relevance through his visits to North Korea (and perhaps a Paddy Power paycheck). Though often described as quite shy, he has always enjoyed challenging the values of Middle America. North Korea is providing him a new avenue to be in the spotlight. The most passive player in this tragicomedy is Rodman's home country, the United States. The U.S. State Department has deployed the rhetorical equivalent of an embarrassed teenager whose dad has shown up to dance at his prom. Something along the lines of ""this has nothing to do with us"" is what the State Department has said with every one of Rodman's trip. Last winter,the State Department criticized Rodman's timing as it followed a nuclear test and rocket launch. This time, it has merely said a private individual can do what he wishes. This is an understandably cautious position. After all, Rodman has professed his love and undying affection for Kim, and he is probably not a canny enough operator to spearhead any form of political outreach along the lines of the ""Ping-Pong diplomacy."" On this trip, Rodman addressed the unavoidably political nature of a relationship with North Korea, saying his visits could ""open the doors"" to ""talk about certain things."" In the CNN interview, he argued that it's a ""great idea for the world."" Rodman's celebrity status and sporting prowess has given him access to Kim. At some point, when both the U.S. and North Korean governments are feeling a little brave, perhaps they can try to thaw the ice with more professional diplomats tagging along on cultural or sporting exchanges. There are precedents. For example, the U.S.-China Ping-Pong diplomacy of the 1970s had its genesis in table tennis player by the name of Glen Cowan. Once he broke the ice, the governments began talking. The kind of engagement that Rodman is pushing cannot always be seen as merely rewards for a naughty regime, as much as we appear locked into a carrot-and-stick way of thinking about relations with North Korea. It can be mutually beneficial. We have the potential to gain as much as they do. Breakthroughs might be sudden and surprising, but they are usually underpinned by creative thinking, dialogue and the mutual acceptance that no one can get exactly what they want. Unfortunately, this particular trip does feel somewhat like a gift, coming as it does on Kim's birthday and less than a month after the violent and very public purge of his uncle and second-in-charge, Jang Song Thaek. Had Rodman pulled out or delayed, the channel for opening may well have closed. If he really is in it for the long haul, he probably couldn't afford to slight the leader on his birthday. Domestically, it is great PR for Kim. He gets to appear gregarious and inclusive in front of his people. Notwithstanding Jang's execution, this is the image he has been assiduously cultivating. He's eager to promote his friendly, approachable image while at the same time enjoying watching some former stars play his favorite sport. For now, little will come out of Rodman's visits other than extraneous news. But as Pyongyang continues to devote resources and energy to sports development, its appetite for athletic exchanges will increase. Let's warily hope, to use Rodman's phrase, that this can ""open the doors"" to other things.","On CNN, Dennis Rodman defended his visit to North Korea, saying it's a good idea .
Andray Abrahamian: Visit puts Rodman in the spotlight and is good PR for Kim Jong Un .
He says this kind of engagement cannot always be seen as reward for a naughty regime .

"(CNN)This year, high school students taking Advanced Placement U.S. history in some parts of the country are getting a lesson in current affairs. And in partisanship. The College Board, which creates standards for what knowledge students in AP classes must demonstrate to get college credit for taking the course, introduced a new 95-page framework that is causing controversy. Not for what's in it, but for what is left out. Conservative school board members in several states say it's biased and not patriotic enough. They complain that the new framework does not mention important facts and figures, like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. or the Founding Fathers and Declaration of Independence. King is mentioned in the guidelines, as are the Black Panthers, but the woman who started the movement against the framework says it's not about specific examples, but what she believes to be a liberal theme. The College Board, backed by many teachers, says that a framework doesn't dictate curriculum, it only guides it. And that it's absurd to conclude that teachers wouldn't teach such important issues as part of American history. Proponents of the new framework argue it was written by professors and historians who are much more qualified to set standards than local school board members. Each side is accusing the other of playing politics with American History. In several states, including Oklahoma, Georgia, Nebraska, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, conservatives have introduced proposals to revise the framework to include specific facts, and to make sure that it promotes American exceptionalism, or to withdraw funding from the College Board. Opinion: Is Oklahoma scared of AP history? ""When you start omitting things, you're censoring things,"" said Ken Mercer, the Texas state board of education member who wrote the first piece of legislation against the framework. ""I was shocked. They had civil rights and Black Panthers, but not Rosa Parks. What's left out smells of agenda."" In response, the College Board said, ""In the face of these attacks  ... AP teachers and students, our member institutions, and the American people can rest assured: The College Board will not compromise the integrity of the Advanced Placement Program."" Nowhere has this caused more disturbance than in Jefferson County, Colorado, where high schoolers have been protesting the school board's decision to establish a review committee for the new framework. Some even walked out of school for several days in the fall. ""This is wrong for Jefferson County, this is wrong for us as students. This is wrong for American history,"" one student said during public comment at an October school board meeting. ""True patriotism ought to be based upon accurate understanding of American history, and not a biased promotion of American exceptionalism,"" said another. Conservative board member Julie Williams wrote the Jefferson County proposal, which states: ""Materials should promote citizenship, patriotism, essentials and benefits of the free enterprise system, respect for authority and respect for individual rights. Materials should not encourage or condone civil disorder, social strife or disregard of the law."" ""I was stunned that this resolution was even coming before the school board,"" said board member Lesley Dahlkemper. ""It's too extreme. It goes too far and I believe our students deserve an unvarnished view of history."" A revised proposal that did not include that strong language passed by a 3-2 vote. ""I was insulted,"" said Stephanie Rossi, who teaches the class at Wheat Ridge High School in Jefferson County. ""The thought that a board member that is supposed to represent an educational institution is assuming that history teachers in her district are going to lead kids to be un-American and unpatriotic."" The students protested again at the November meeting, reading aloud from their history textbooks. Conservative board member Ken Witt, who voted for the framework, said he believes it is the right of a local school board to review the curriculum of all classes students take. ""You know, there is a national dialogue around AP U.S. history and a lot of concerns have been raised about the balance in that curriculum,"" Witt said. When pressed, he could not give specific examples of his concerns, and said only that he wanted a review of it. Williams refused multiple requests to talk to CNN. ""In my opinion we need to teach the good, the bad and the ugly,"" said Jill Fellman, the other board member who voted against it. ""We need to make sure our kids understand what it is like to be an American."" The College Board has responded to this by defending the framework, but also allowing public comment through February. The discussion is expected to pick up again in the summer. In a statement, it said, ""In the face of these attacks ... AP teachers and students, our member institutions, and the American people can rest assured: The College Board will not compromise the integrity of the Advanced Placement Program."" The furor began with Larry Krieger, a college test prep instructor and former AP history teacher. When the College Board made public the new framework and announced it would replace an older five-page version starting this year, Krieger connected with Jane Robbins, a senior fellow at the conservative think tank American Principles Project. ""There was a relentless negative drumbeat about America, all of the themes all of the concepts."" Robbins, a leader of the effort against the new framework, said it gives special emphasis to race, gender and ethnic identities. ""That is sort of the leftist goal, having all of history viewed through that lens,"" she said. Together, Robbins and Krieger penned an op-ed that barely anyone noticed until Robbins was giving a speech in Texas and mentioned Krieger's complaint. ""There was a member of the Texas State Board of Education in audience -- Ken Mercer,"" Robbins said. ""He came up and expressed concern and asked what could be done. That led to the resolution he introduced."" Mercer then wrote a resolution that included language so strong that it was noticed by the Republican National Committee. The framework, he wrote, ""reflects a view of American history that is critical of American exceptionalism, the free enterprise system and emphasizes negative aspects of our nation's history while minimizing positive aspects."" An RNC talking points memo followed, and ripped the phrase straight from Mercer's resolution, adding to it a request that ""Congress withhold any federal funding to the College Board (a private nongovernmental organization) until the APUSH course and examination have been rewritten in a transparent manner to accurately reflect U.S. history without a political bias."" From there, it trickled down to local school boards. Resolutions with many of the exact same phrases as the RNC memo appeared in places such as Nebraska and North Carolina. ""In the past it was five pages, a list of what teachers are supposed to go over,"" said Texas state board chairwoman Barbara Cargill. ""Now it's 98 pages, it's detailed. Me, I'm a former teacher. To me it looked more like a curriculum."" In other states, the issue has not been as disruptive. It was most recently raised in Georgia and Oklahoma. The language from a resolution introduced by Republican Georgia state Sen. William Ligon mirrors the RNC memo nearly word-for-word, as many state resolutions do. In Oklahoma, a bill passed an education committee that would have eliminated state funding for AP U.S. history classes unless the College Board changed the framework. But after an outcry, the bill's sponsor said he'd rewrite the legislation and change the wording. In North Carolina, there is concern the new framework doesn't meet state standards for what should be taught, state Rep. Craig Horn told CNN. ""We insist on the study of our founding principles,"" he said. ""We're either going to require them to take a course before APUSH, or find another way, but we're pretty stubborn about it."" But when a local school board in Hanover County, North Carolina, asked the state Board of Education not to implement the new framework, it raised concerns that students there might lose out on the opportunity to get college credit. The chairman of the state board, Bill Cobey, told CNN that they are in a ""listening and discussing stage."" ""We're not ready to do anything,"" Cobey said. ""I want what's best for the children and students of North Carolina, and I certainly don't want them to lose any opportunity to take Advanced Placement history."" In Texas, where it began, teachers are being told to ""fill in"" the framework with state-issued curriculum standards for U.S. history, Cargill said, adamant that it would not affect the college credits that students can get for taking the class. ""It's too important. Those AP courses are really critical for (grade-point average) and college scholarships,"" Cargill said. The Republican Party in Douglas County, Nebraska, introduced a resolution that mirrored the RNC memo, and State Board of Education member Glen Flint wrote in a blog post dated October 30 that the board is ""currently studying the issue,"" and ""we should take a stand against any attempt to nationalize or circumvent state standards and local control,"" he wrote. In Tennessee, legislation was introduced in November that would create a commission to examine any new AP framework from the College Board. ""The real controversy is the wording in the key concepts of this framework. Until the College Board revises that wording and bias in there, this issue is not going to die down,"" Cargill said. CNN's Glen Dacy contributed to this report.","Several states debating new framework for AP history instruction .

"(CNN)West Coast dock workers and port management have been locked in heated labor negotiations since their contract expired in July of 2014 . Such negotiations are often difficult and proceed in fits and starts. But in this case, the increasingly contentious and protracted dispute could have major economic consequences for America if it isn't settled soon. During these negotiations, port operations have gradually slowed as each side seeks to put pressure on the other. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union and the Pacific Maritime Association need to set aside their differences and reach an agreement that will ensure the continued success and competitiveness of these ports. And it is imperative that an agreement be reached without any further slowdowns or shutdowns. This serious drag in talks threatens to disrupt the U.S. economic recovery, which is still fragile. The negotiators aren't the ones suffering  -- it's all of the other industries, employers and employees throughout the country who depend on goods moving in and out of the ports. Agricultural exports are rotting at the ports, and in some cases, in the fields. They can't be picked because they can't be shipped. Manufacturers are shutting down shifts for lack of imported parts and losing overseas customers because goods are not being shipped, or they're resorting to air shipments that cost significantly more than traditional shipping methods. Retailers are not getting critical merchandise for the upcoming spring and summer seasons. Trucking and railroad companies are either sitting idle or handling far less cargo, and trains are not moving westward because they cannot unload, which is causing disruptions in the rail freight system across the country. This brinksmanship is also causing long-term damage to the reliability of American companies. When international customers can't get what they need from American suppliers -- both agricultural and manufactured -- there are plenty of competitors from other countries ready to step in. Once those contracts are lost, they will be very difficult to get back. Similarly, there will be long-term consequences for the West Coast ports as shippers and those who rely on goods moving in and out of these ports find other ways to bring their cargo into North America -- either through Canada, Mexico or through the expanded Panama Canal to the Gulf and East Coast ports. Even if a deal was done tomorrow, there will be many months before all the backed up cargo is pushed through the system. Ultimately, if there is a full shutdown, it will cost exporters, importers, shippers and others an estimated $2 billion a day. The 10-day shutdown in 2002 cost the economy and estimated $1 billion a day and took a half year to clear out the backlog of containers. The situation has reached crisis point, and the parties must find a way to get a deal and get goods moving again.  The situation is so urgent, and distress over the West Coast ports has become so widespread, that lawmakers from both sides of the aisle held a news conference at the Capitol last week to press for action. We have called on President Barack Obama to use his bully pulpit to ramp up the urgency on these negotiations and make clear to the parties that the country is desperate for them to get a deal. We were pleased to see that President Obama dispatched Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez to California to meet with the parties and convey to them the desperate need to find a resolution. We've been encouraged that Secretary Perez has reached out to learn about the impacts this stalemate is causing throughout the country. If a full shutdown does occur, we will request that the President use his full authority under the Taft-Hartley Act to force the parties back into negotiations and keep the ports open. The answer, though, is for the parties to come together now and reach an agreement.","Labor negotiations on West Coast ports will have major economic impact if the dispute isn't settled soon .

"(CNN)It's been a tough month for the ""Islamic State."" Its fighters were finally driven out of the Syrian border town of Kobani after more than 100 days of fighting against Kurdish militia; Iraqi government forces pushed ISIS back in Diyala province; the city of Mosul -- still under ISIS control -- is beginning to look vulnerable. And airstrikes have taken a toll on the group's infrastructure and field commanders. Its ability to win the release of a jailed jihadist in Jordan or the ability of its followers in Libya to attack a Tripoli hotel may provide brief propaganda boons, but they don't affect the fundamentals on the ground. Nor will its attempts to export terror to Europe. But lest anyone declare victory, predictions of ISIS' demise are wildly optimistic. ISIS still controls some 50,000 square kilometers of Iraq as well as up to 30% of Syrian territory and at least 10% of its population. To the west of Baghdad, it is still on the offensive in Anbar, and recently raided checkpoints on the Iraqi-Saudi border. Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said last week:  ""We're only six to seven months into this thing....This is going to be a long struggle."" A senior official at the U.S. State Department echoed Kirby's line this week, saying ISIS' expulsion from Kobani is part of the ""early phase of a multi-year campaign."" ISIS is ""a very adaptive organization,"" the official said -- and terms like ""turning point"" were to be avoided. Even so, there's quite a contrast between September, when U.S. officials said the fall of Kobani to ISIS seemed inevitable, and Kurds celebrating on the city's streets this week. ISIS chose Kobani as a symbol of its virility, even sending hostage John Cantile there to make a video about the group's inevitable victory. Kobani was a recruitment poster in ISIS' efforts to draw more foreign fighters to the Caliphate. ISIS continued to reinforce its presence in the town despite constant airstrikes. General John Allen, U.S. coordinator of the campaign against ISIS, said in November that the group had ""impaled itself"" on Kobani. The State Department official said ISIS' losses there -- likely running into four figures -- could help counter the messaging that has attracted foreign fighters. ""A narrative of inevitable glory and conquest"" had been replaced by images of bodies left on the streets, the official said. A growing number of those foreign fighters may also be disillusioned after several months of airstrikes. Setbacks in Kobani and elsewhere have led to a stream of deserters, dozens of whom have been executed according to local activists cited by the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights. Analysts say one trend in coming months may be a stream of disillusioned foreigners trying to escape ISIS territory. In Iraq a leading expert on ISIS, Hisham Al Hashimi, told CNN that ISIS has now lost ground in several areas and needs to regroup. Torbjorn Soltvedt, a senior analyst at consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, agrees that ISIS is on the back foot in Iraq, relying more on classic insurgency tactics such as roadside bombs and unable to move in force because of the threat of airstrikes. Among its latest reverses, ISIS has lost control over a number of villages in the province of Diyala, north-east of Baghdad. Iraqi troops and Shia militia known as Popular Mobilization Units launched an offensive last week to retake ISIS' last strongholds around Muqdadiyah -- 50 miles (80km) from the capital. According to Iraqi commanders, the whole province of Diyala is now back in government hands, after several months of intermittent battles. Soltvedt says it became increasingly difficult for ISIS to sustain its supply lines in the region. The key prize for all sides in Iraq remains Mosul, a city of 1.5 million people on the Tigris river, held by ISIS since last June. ISIS has invested heavily in governing the city; its leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi pronounced his leadership of the Caliphate at the Grand Mosque there last July. For their part, Kurdish officials say that as long as ISIS holds Mosul, it threatens Kurdistan. Likewise, neither the government in Baghdad nor its coalition partners can rest while terrorists occupy Iraq's second-largest city. Peshmerga forces have made steady progress against ISIS north and west of Mosul over the last two months. They have taken some 3,000 square kilometers of the Sinjar area, as well as the area around the Mosul dam, choking off access routes and threatening ISIS' main resupply route to Syria. To the south, Iraqi forces' gains around Baiji have also restricted ISIS' freedom of movement. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), which studies military activity in Iraq and Syria, says ISIS is preparing to dig a defensive trench around Mosul, and has blown up a bridge on a key western approach. ISW also reports an increase in executions by ISIS across Nineveh province, where Mosul is located, which it sees as further evidence ""ISIS is feeling pressured by internal resistance in the province."" (There is anecdotal evidence of resistance across the border in Syria too; a senior ISIS police official who had supervised executions was himself found beheaded in Deir Ezzor early in January.) There had been talk of a January offensive to retake Mosul, but any assault now seems many weeks away.  Kirby told CNN's Barbara Starr Tuesday that the timing could not be predicted ""but obviously we're working closely with Iraqi security forces on helping them better understand the challenges"" of an assault on Mosul. Iraqi units are already fully occupied elsewhere -- notably in Anbar province, where ISIS threatens Ramadi and other areas. An assault on Mosul would have to be meticulously co-ordinated from several different directions, informed by good intelligence and supported from the air. A massive intelligence-gathering effort is already under way, according to analysts. Even so, Mosul's remaining residents are predominantly Sunni Arabs and would be wary of Kurdish and Shia militia, so regular forces from the reconstituted Iraqi army would likely have to take the lead. The recent history of urban warfare in Iraq should give pause, analysts say, recalling the brutal battles to evict al Qaeda from Fallujah in 2004. Soltvedt says an uprising from within is much preferable to an assault from without, and some observers predict any operation to retake Mosul wouldn't happen until early summer. Another problem for ISIS is that coalition airstrikes and ground operations by Iraqi and Peshmerga forces appear to be whittling away ISIS' commanders -- even if claims by some US officials that half of ISIS' leadership has been taken out appear optimistic. Among prominent casualties reported by Iraqi and Kurdish officials in the past two months are ISIS' governor for Anbar province, Abu Anas Samarraie, and Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, a member of ISIS' Shura Council, its highest policy-making body. Soltvedt says some of ISIS' most seasoned fighters have also left Iraq -- some returning to Libya, for example. More importantly, he says, there is only a finite pool of skilled military commanders -- some of them former officers in Saddam Hussein's army, and ""they will have a problem replacing them"" if they are killed. Even where ISIS suffers defeat, there is no guarantee the Iraqi government can secure and hold territory. The prominent role of Shia militia may yet make it difficult for Baghdad to pacify areas after ISIS retreats. During the Diyala offensive, the militia killed some 70 Sunni civilians, a local member of Parliament, Nahida al-Daini, told Reuters. Others claimed the militia had burned down houses and mosques. The Iraqi Interior Ministry denied the claims, but it's not the first time these militia have been accused of atrocities during military offensives -- and that may weaken the readiness of Sunni tribes to help the government against ISIS. The Iraqi government has proposed bringing the militia under the umbrella of a National Guard. Oil Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi wrote on his Facebook page that it would ""be possible to organize the [Shia] Popular Mobilization forces, the [Sunni] Sons of Iraq and the Peshmerga under the umbrella of the National Guard, knowing that the main goal of the latter is to prevent the emergence of militias, put all the weapons under the supervision of the state and provide backup forces when needed."" But there is plenty of resistance to the idea because such militia have often been the best guarantee of a community's security. In areas it liberates, the Iraqi government will have to provide security, rehabilitation and effective governance to people who -- with good reason -- don't believe Baghdad can provide any of the above. ISIS also benefits from being able to use both Syrian and Iraqi territory as the battlefield shifts. While under pressure in northern Iraq, its forces can regroup across the border in Syria's Hasaka province. It can also use the frontier from Deir Ezzor into Iraq's Anbar province, ""where it enjoys real strategic depth and the Iraqi army struggles with long supply lines,"" says Soltvedt. It has even begun to probe the Iraqi-Saudi border. ISIS also controls a number of small oil fields and an arsenal of weaponry captured in both Iraq and Syria. And it still has money. Iraqi Finance Minister Hoshyar Zebari told Reuters he estimates ISIS has looted $456 million from banks in Mosul, Tikrit and Baiji since June. And it has set up a rudimentary taxation system in the main cities it controls, as well as a fearsome intelligence apparatus. But ISIS is finding the job of controlling much harder than that of attacking. It has needed an expensive and labor-intensive mix of coercion, intimidation and policing to run Mosul, where the Iraqi government still pays the bulk of state employees' salaries. Under pressure on several fronts, ""ISIS now has to think very carefully about where it puts its forces,"" says Soltvedt. CNN's Barbara Starr, Laura Koran and Raja Razek contributed to this report.","ISIS fighters have been driven out of Kobani in Syria and pushed back in Iraq .

Experts say the fight against ISIS is likely to take several years ."
"(CNN) -- Wal-Mart has agreed to pay nearly $2 million and take extra safety precautions after a stampede killed a store employee in Long Island, New York, last year. Wal-Mart says it will consider applying the new safety measures in its other stores. The top prosecutor in Nassau County said she struck the deal rather than pursue criminal charges in the death of a 34-year-old man who was trampled to death as shoppers flooded into the store. It happened as the store opened on the day after Thanksgiving, which is traditionally among the busiest days of the year for retailers. Wal-Mart agreed to pay $1.5 million for community programs in Nassau County and another $400,000 to compensate people who were injured in the incident and repay them for out-of-pocket expenditures, District Attorney Kathleen Rice of Nassau County said in a statement. The district attorney and Wal-Mart said they agreed on a crowd-management plan that the retailer will implement at each of its 92 stores in New York for after-Thanksgiving shopping. The plan was developed by experts who have worked on crowd management at Super Bowls and Olympic Games, said Hank Mullany, a senior vice president at the company. Wal-Mart ""will consider how aspects of this plan could apply to stores outside of New York,"" he said in a statement. ""We have never had a tragedy like this in our stores, and we don't want it to happen again,"" his statement said. ""We are committed to learning from it and making our stores even safer for our customers and our associates."" The agreement between Nassau County and Wal-Mart ""does not include an admission of guilt or wrongdoing by the corporation,"" the district attorney said. Discussions that yielded the agreement, which was announced Wednesday, started after a temporary Wal-Mart employee -- Jdimytai Damour of Jamaica -- was trampled to death at the Green Valley Wal-Mart in Long Island around 5 a.m. on November 28. At the time, Detective Lt. Michael Fleming of the Nassau County police described ""utter chaos"" when Wal-Mart workers tried to open the store doors that day. By 5 a.m. that Friday, when the doors were unlocked, there were about 2,000 shoppers waiting to enter, and many ""surged forward,"" breaking the doors, he said. Video showed as many as a dozen people knocked to the floor in the stampede of people trying to get into the Wal-Mart store, Fleming said. The employee was ""stepped on by hundreds of people"" as other workers attempted to fight their way through the crowd, Fleming said. ""Several minutes"" passed before others were able to clear space around the man and attempt to render aid. Police arrived, and ""as they were giving first aid, those police officers were also jostled and pushed,"" he said. ""Shoppers ... were on a full-out run into the store,"" he said.","DA makes deal with Wal-Mart in case of shopper stampede that killed employee .

"The flow of refugees fleeing Syria into Turkey has reached an unprecedented level in the past two days, a U.N. official said Sunday. ""I don't think in the last three and a half years we have seen 100,000 people cross in two days,"" said Carol Batchelor, a representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Turkey. Humanitarian officials counted ""well over 70,000"" crossing the Syria-Turkey border starting Friday and into Saturday, with more coming, Batchelor said.  ""Not everyone has been registered.  It may even be over 100,000 people."" The number of Syrian refugees now in Turkey is approaching 1.6 million ""and quite frankly, we don't know when those numbers will end,"" she said. Turkey opened eight checkpoints along its border, allowing refugees trapped between the fighting and the border to enter its southeastern Sanliurfa province on Friday. As refugees move into Turkey, hundreds of Kurdish fighters from Turkey have arrived in the Syrian Kurdish town of Ayn al-Arab to join a Kurdish militia group battling to hold off advancing ISIS forces, activists said Saturday.  The town, known to Kurds as Kobani, is surrounded by ISIS, which refers to itself as the Islamic State, on three fronts and the Turkish border to the north. The Kurdish militia, called the People's Protection Unit, is battling with the ISIS fighters in the area, according the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The latest ISIS advance in Syria has brought a swath of the country's north-central Kurdish region under siege. Some 60 villages fell under ISIS control in recent days, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.  ISIS took 39 villages on Friday alone as Kurdish forces withdrew from their positions, it said. ""The conversation is no longer about withdrawing from this village or taking control of that place. For the People's Protection Unit, it is about resisting the attack by ISIS and defending 50,000 Kurds from a massacre,"" Mostafa Baly, a Kurdish activist inside Ayn al-Arab, told CNN on Saturday. The influx of Kurdish fighters to the area increased tensions between the Kurdistan Workers Party and Turkish security forces, who used tear gas and water cannons against them in several clashes. Dozens of Turkish hostages seized by ISIS in Iraq . The release of 49 Turkish citizens taken hostage when ISIS took control of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, in June has removed a barrier to Turkey joining the international call to form a coalition to fight ISIS, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Sunday.  He was quoted by his country's semi-official news agency Anadolu. The 49 hostages, including Turkish diplomats and their families, arrived on Turkish soil Saturday. Erdogan denied reports he made a financial deal with ISIS for their freedom, but conceded it was ""a political, diplomatic bargain.""

"(CNN)A pair of dramatic raids Friday in France led to the killing of three terrorists -- one suspected in the fatal shooting of a policewoman and four hostages, the other two in the massacre at the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine -- and to the freeing of more than a dozen people being held hostage. The French government's work is not over. There's still a lot of healing to do, a lot of questions to answer about how to prevent future attacks, and the pursuit of a woman wanted in the policewoman's shooting. Still, as Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said, ""The nation is relieved tonight."" Latest updates at 8 p.m. ET . •The wife of suspect Cherif Kouachi and the girlfriend of hostage taker Amedy Coulibaly-- Hayat Boumedienne -- exchanged 500 phone calls in 2014, according to Paris prosecutor Francois Molin. The wife told investigators that Cherif and Coulibaly knew each well. • Cherif Kouachi, a suspect in the Charlie Hebdo slaughter, visited Yemen in 2011 and French authorities were aware of his contacts with terrorist organizations in Yemen and Syria, Molins said at a press conference. • The government of Yemen has launched an investigation into a possible al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula link to the Charlie Hebdo magazine attack, Mohammed Albasha, Yemen's spokesman in Washington, tweeted Friday. • Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has claimed responsibility for orchestrating the deadly terrorist attack on the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo, the founder of the magazine The Intercept, Jeremy Scahill, told CNN. CNN has not independently confirmed this claim. • Four hostages were killed and 15 survived in the standoff between an armed terrorist and police at a Paris kosher grocery store on Friday, according to Israeli government sources who characterized a phone conversation between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and French President François Hollande. • U.S. President Barack Obama said he wants the people of France to know that the United States ""stands with you today, stands with you tomorrow"" after this week's terror. He told a crowd in Tennessee that ""we stand for freedom and hope and dignity of all human beings, (and) that's what Paris stands for."" • The FBI and U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a bulletin to law enforcement across the United States discussing the Paris terrorist attack this week and the sophistication of the tactics, a U.S. law enforcement source told CNN. The bulletin says the attacks demonstrated ""a degree of sophistication and training traditionally not seen in recent small armed attacks,"" the official said. • A man claiming to be Amedy Coulibaly, the suspected hostage-taker at the Paris grocery store, told CNN affiliate BFMTV that he belonged to the Islamist militant group ISIS. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the recording. Charlie Hebdo attackers holed up in print shop . The day's drama began in Dammartin-en-Goele, where brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi ended up in a print shop in an industrial area. A salesman, who identified himself only as Didier, told France Info radio that he shook one of the gunman's hands at about 8:30 a.m. as they arrived at the business. Didier said he first thought the man, who was dressed in black and heavily armed, was a police officer. As he left, the armed man said, ""Go, we don't kill civilians."" Didier said, ""It wasn't normal. I did not know what was going on."" The gunmen told police that they wanted to die as martyrs, Yves Albarello, who is in France's Parliament, said on channel iTele. The area, meanwhile, was locked down -- with children stuck in schools, roads closed and shops shuttered. Shortly before 5 p.m., gunshots and at least three large explosions pierced the relative silence. . Soon after, men could be seen on the roof of the building where the brothers had holed up. Four helicopters landed nearby. Word came that the brothers were dead and that a man who had been hiding in the building was safe, said Bernard Corneille, the mayor of nearby Othis. Hostages at kosher grocery store . At the same time, in a different setting near Paris's Porte de Vincennes about 40 kilometers (25 miles) away, a similar crisis played out at a kosher store. Amedy Coulibaly -- the same man who, authorities said, is suspected with Hayat Boumeddiene of killing a policewoman Thursday south of Paris -- on Friday took a number of hostages there. Boumeddiene remains at large. Like Cherif Kouachi, a man claiming to be Coulibaly called BFMTV on Friday. At the scene, witnesses heard Coulibaly demand freedom for the Kouachi brothers, according to police union spokesman Pascal Disand. Law enforcement swarmed the area. Dozens of schools went on lockdown. A resolution came a few minutes after the Dammartin-en-Goele climax, in the form of explosions and gunfire. Up to 20 heavily armed police officers moved into the store. They came out with a number of civilians. Not everyone made it. Hollande said four people were killed. Israeli government sources told CNN that Hollande told Netanyahu that four hostages were killed and 15 were rescued. Molins said four hostages were killed by the gunman before police stormed the market. Father: 'It's like a war' In a speech Friday night, Hollande called the Porte de Vincennes deaths an ""anti-Semitic"" act. He urged his countrymen not to respond with violence against Muslims, saying, ""Those who committed these acts have nothing to do with the Muslim religion."" ""Unity"" he said, ""is our best weapon."" That kind of military language is apt when you're talking about two deadly attacks and violent standoffs in a few days. It's something that a man, who asked to be called simply Teddy, understands. He was outside Henri Dunant elementary school in Dammartin-en-Goele on Friday, hoping to pick up his young son. And, eventually, the students did leave the school -- accompanied by police officers who held their hands and, in some cases, lifted them onto an awaiting bus that would take them to safety. ""It's like a war,"" Teddy said. ""I don't know how I will explain this to my 5-year-old son."" Parts of France on high alert . This ""war"" erupted two days ago, when a pair of heavily armed men -- hooded and dressed in black -- entered the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine known for its provocative, often profane, take on religion, politics and most anything else. Satirical magazine is no stranger to controversy . They burst into a meeting, called out individuals, and then executed them. The dead included editor and cartoonist Stephane Charbonnier and four other well-known cartoonists known by the pen names: Cabu, Wolinski, Honore and Tignous. Authorities followed a lead Thursday morning from a gas station attendant near Villers-Cotterets, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Dammartin-en-Goele, whom Cherif Kouachi, 32, and Said Kouachi, 34, reportedly threatened as they stole food and gas. Police think the brothers may have later fled on foot into nearby woods. Ties to Islamist extremists . As the suspects moved, the French government -- including more than 80,000 police deployed across the country -- also didn't stand still. Some of them tried to prevent more bloodshed, which might have something to do with nine people detained after the Charlie Hebdo attacks. Investigators also dug to learn about the attackers. Who are the suspects? Both men had ties to Islamist extremists. Said, the elder of the Kouachi brothers, spent several months in Yemen in 2011, receiving weapons training and working with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, according to U.S. officials. His younger brother, Cherif, has a long history of jihad and anti-Semitism, according to documents obtained by CNN. In a 400-page court record, he is described as wanting to go to Iraq through Syria ""to go and combat the Americans."" ""I was ready to go and die in battle,"" he said in a deposition. ""... I got this idea when I saw the injustices shown by television. ... I am speaking about the torture that the Americans have inflicted on the Iraqis."" Cherif was a close associate of Coulibaly, a Western intelligence source told CNN. A man claiming to be Cherif told CNN affiliate BFMTV in a phone call before he was shot and killed Friday that he was sent to carry out the massacre by al Qaeda in Yemen and that the late Anwar al-Awlaki financed his trip. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the recording. Al-Awlaki, an American-born Muslim scholar and cleric who acted as a spokesperson for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, was killed in 2011 by a CIA drone strike. Cherif  and Coulibaly were involved in a 2010 attempt to free an Algerian incarcerated for a 1995 subway bombing. Coulibaly was arrested with 240 rounds of ammunition for a Kalashnikov rifle and a photo of Djamel Beghal, a French Algerian once known as al Qaeda's premier European recruiter. The Western intelligence source said that Coulibaly lived with Boumeddiene, his alleged accomplice in the police shooting, and that the two traveled to Malaysia together. Charlie Hebdo columnist: 'They didn't want us to be quiet' A unity rally will be held Sunday ""celebrating the values behind"" Charlie Hebdo, said British Prime Minister David Cameron, who will travel to Paris to attend. And the magazine itself -- whose former offices were firebombed in 2011, on the day it was to publish an issue poking fun at Islamic law and after it published a cartoon of the Muslim Prophet Mohammed -- will go on as well, even without its leader and most talented staffers. It's set to publish thousands of copies of its latest edition next Wednesday. Patrick Pelloux, a columnist for the magazine, told CNN that ""I don't know if I'm afraid anymore, because I've seen fear. I was scared for my friends, and they are dead."" He and many others are defiant. ""I know that they didn't want us to be quiet,"" Pelloux said of the slain Charlie Hebdo staffers.""They would be assassinated twice, if we remained silent."" CNN's Jim Sciutto, Ben Brumfield, Atika Shubert, Laura Smith-Spark, Richard Greene, Fred Pleitgen, Christiane Amanpour, Jim Bittermann and Bryony Jones contributed to this report.","Four hostages killed, prosecutor says .

"Vienna, Austria. 1990. A man weeps by a grave. He lowers his head and murmurs a few quiet words. He sits awhile, glances intently at the writing on the headstone, he uses the palm of his hand to wipe away the dirt. His eyes glaze over with a look of hopelessness, almost pleading for something to happen. Nothing happens. The man rises, turns and leaves. That night he gets his answer -- the curse lives on. Despite being finalists on seven occasions in various major European finals --  in 1963, 1965, 1968, 1983, 1988, 1990 and in 2013 -- each time Benfica have been unable to bury the famous curse. Bela Guttmann's curse. A condemnation that even the prayers of his famous protege Eusebio could not lift that day in Vienna. ""Every year when Benfica plays in the Europe they try to get rid of the curse,"" Portuguese journalist Jose Carlos Soares told CNN. ""Any time that Benfica play near Guttmann's grave, somebody will take flowers. It hasn't worked."" The way Benfica were beaten by Chelsea in Wednesday's Europa League final in Amsterdam -- Branislav Ivanovic's injury-time header securing the English side's 2-1 win  -- if you were fan of the Portuguese side you could have been forgiven for thinking some other powerful force was at work. Even in death, Guttmann is determined to have his own way -- much to the anguish of a club he left in anger after taking it to the peak of European football in the early 1960s. A charismatic and sometimes eccentric genius, Guttmann revolutionized football during a coaching career which spanned 25 jobs in 13 different countries before he passed away in 1981, aged 82. Holocaust . Born into a Jewish family in Budapest in 1899, Guttmann, like his parents, became a trained dance instructor before switching his focus to football. After becoming part of the MTK Hungaria side which won the league title in 1920 and 1921, Guttmann left for Vienna following the rise of anti-Semitism under Miklos Horthy's regime. It was here, among the Austrian intelligentsia, that he flourished, taking in the political and literary debates in Vienna's coffee-house society. There he joined the exclusively Jewish football club Hakoah Wien, where he won the league title in 1925 as well as winning four caps for Hungary. After traveling on a tour to the U.S. with Hakoah, Guttmann decided to stay put in New York only to lose a considerable amount of money in the Wall Street crash. That forced the nomadic traveler to move on once again, first back to Vienna where he took on a coaching role with Hakoah before joining Dutch side SC Enschede. But Guttmann's life, like those of so many other Jews, was turned on its head during the rise of Hitler in Europe and the Holocaust which killed six million people. ""Guttmann was hugely talented,"" says leading football writer Jonathan Wilson, author of the book ""Outsider: A History of the Goalkeeper."" ""He was tactically very astute but also very awkward and difficult,"" Wilson told CNN. ""He was very quick to take offense. ""The central theme with Guttmann is the war. We don't know how he survived it, and the fact he skips over it in his book could mean one of two things. ""Did he feel guilty for surviving or did he compromise himself to stay alive? ""Or, perhaps it was that the memories were just too painful to share and that the loss of so many of his loved ones meant he didn't speak about it. ""He was hugely successful but there was something tragic about him, which probably comes from that time."" Famine . While family members, including a brother, perished in concentration camps, Guttmann escaped to Switzerland where he was held in internment. It wasn't until the end of the war in 1945 that he returned to football, this time in Romania. It was here, in 1946 with club side Ciokanul, that he demanded to be paid in vegetables at a time when famine was a growing problem. While parsnips and carrots were gratefully received, Guttmann's relationship with the board was never a particularly healthy one. When a club director began to interfere in team selection, Guttmann finally lost patience. His fiery temper and attitude of ""my way or the highway"" earned him plenty of attention, especially from the media. Following spells with Padova and Triestina in Italy, Boca Juniors and Quilmes in Argentina and Apoel Nicosia in Cyprus, Guttmann hit the big time with AC Milan in 1953. His team led the Serie A table after 19 games in his second season, only for another run-in with the board to curtail his tenure. ""I have been sacked, even though I am neither a criminal nor a homosexual,"" he told a shocked press conference. ""Goodbye."" Nomadic career . Years later, on his first day as the manager of Benfica, he fired 20 players before leading the club to the Portuguese title. ""He was an incredible man,"" Wilson said. ""Did he become a parody of himself? Did he do those kind of things because people expected it? ""I don't know. But it was clear that he never wanted to stay in one place for long, he was always moving. ""That could have been because of the war, but also because he was looking for the next pay check."" It was in Portugal, after a successful spell in South America, that Guttmann really secured his legacy, securing back-to-back European Cups with Benfica in 1961 and 1962. It was the first time that any club other than Real Madrid had won the competition. During his time in Brazil with Sao Paulo between 1957 and 1958, where he won the league title before moving to Porto, Guttmann introduced the 4-2-4 system which Brazil used at the 1958 World Cup. Inspiration . It was a system that laid the groundwork for the great Brazil sides to establish themselves as masters of the beautiful game. Guttmann had taken some inspiration from the great Gustav Sebes, the man who coached the ""Magnificent Magyars"" in the 1950s. Under Sebes, also of Jewish descent, Hungary became the first nation to defeat England on its home soil, winning 6-3 in 1953 before reaching the World Cup final the following year. From 1950 until the Hungarian Revolution in 1956, the national team won 42 games, drew seven and lost just once --- in the World Cup final against West Germany. Sebes preferred a 3-2-1-4 formation which allowed Ferenc Puskas, the great Hungarian striker, to thrive alongside the precociously talented Nandor Hidekuti. That slowly changed to the 4-2-4 formation which would inspire Benfica to European and domestic glory. ""I never minded if the opposition scored, because I always thought we could score another,"" Guttmann once said. His thirst for innovation and his psychology degree, which he earned in his younger days, helped him become a leading figure in man-management and a master tactician. At Benfica, it was the arrival of Eusebio which allowed Guttmann to play Mario Coluna in a deeper position and unleash one of the most attacking teams of the era. Benfica defeated Barcelona 3-2 in Berne in the 1961 European Cup final before coming from behind to beat then five-time winners Real Madrid 5-3 the following year. But where there was triumph, disaster was never far away. ""From the moment he arrived in Portugal, Bela Guttman's relationship with Benfica was destined to be complex,"" says Portuguese football expert Ben Shave. ""After the second European Cup victory, Guttman approached the recently-elected president Antonio Carlos Cabral Fezas Vital with what seemed an eminently reasonable request -- a pay rise. ""Vital chose to turn Guttman down, whereupon the Hungarian departed with what has become a well-worn parting shot: a simple declaration that Benfica would not win another European Cup. ""Guttman's curse has proved painfully prophetic -- the Aguias have lost five European Cup finals in 1963, 1965, 1968, 1988, 1990, the 1983 Uefa Cup final and now the Europa League final."" Mourinho comparison . Remembered for his uncompromising attitude, his innovation on the field and his nomadic existence, Guttmann's story gained further resonance following the emergence of Portuguese coach Jose Mourinho, a European champion with Porto in 2004 and Inter Milan in 2010 after beginning his career with a brief spell at Benfica. ""Guttman's prickly personality and relentless pursuit of success have led to comparisons with Mourinho in some quarters,"" Shave told CNN. ""What is certainly true is that both left Benfica in unfortunate fashion, and both departures became matters of considerable regret for the club. ""The results of Guttman's 'curse' have been well documented, whilst presidential candidate Manuel Vilarinho's stated wish to replace Mourinho with club legend Toni following the 2000 elections led to 'the Special One' taking his talents elsewhere. ""In a similar scenario to that which led to Guttman's tenure coming to an end, Mourinho approached Vilarinho with a contract extension request shortly after his election (and a 3-0 win over Sporting), which was denied. ""Vilarinho's opponents have dined out on that mistake since."" As for the Benfica's players the task of finally closing the book on Guttmann's curse continues.","Bela Guttmann was a Hungarian Jew who survived the Holocaust .
He led Portuguese soccer team Benfica to European Cup glory in 1961 and 1962 .

"Washington (CNN)Few White House hopefuls would ever want to be compared to former President Richard Nixon, but some of Hillary Clinton's pre-campaign moves -- or lack thereof -- are reminiscent of the 37th president. As Clinton eyes another run at the presidency in 2016, some close to her -- especially those who are cheering reports she may wait until summer to officially announce a bid -- point to Nixon's successful 1968 presidential bid as a positive sign, particularly how Nixon's public operation went dark for about six months before entering the race. Despite being the presumed Democratic front-runner since Obama was reelected in 2012, Clinton has been largely absent from the public spotlight since the midterms wrapped in November 2014. And with the exception of the occasional paid speech and non-profit event, she could lie-low through the spring, a months-long hiatus similar to one Nixon took more than fifty years ago before winning the presidency for the first time. In ""The Greatest Comeback: How Richard Nixon Rose from Defeat to Create the New Majority,"" author and longtime Nixon aide Patrick Buchanan retells the debate and intrigue around Nixon deciding to take a six-month hiatus from presidential politics ahead of the 1968 election. The comparisons to Clinton, while not perfect -- she is the same young lawyer who worked as an aide on the Nixon impeachment trial of the former president -- are obvious. Clinton is the favorite to win the Democratic nomination in 2016 and has already had to deal with attacks about her not being a ""fresh face."" A CNN/ORC poll out Wednesday found that Clinton leads the field with a whopping 61%. Both candidates have unsuccessfully sought the presidential nomination before and held high profile West Wing positions elevating their status and name recognition. Nixon, who had then served a vice president for eight years but lost in the 1960 presidential election and the 1962 California gubernatorial race, was seen as the overwhelming favorite to win the Republican nomination in 1968. There was strong competition -- notably from then Michigan Gov. George Romney -- but none had the support Nixon had. That is why, according to Buchanan, it was shocking when Nixon told an interviewer that after the 1966 midterm elections he was ""going to take a holiday from politics for at least six months."" ""Is it really wise to cede the field to Romney and lock ourselves into a six-month moratorium with no flexibility,"" Buchanan recalls asking Nixon. Nixon pointedly responded: ""Let 'em chew on him for a little while."" ""That is what he expected the press to do to George. Romney, and that is what the press did,"" Buchanan writes. ""The new year would prove an annus horribilis for the governor of Michigan."" Buchanan adds: Nixon knew ""if he started out on a presidential campaign in 1967, even as an unannounced candidate... the press and public would tire of him and begin looking about for the 'fresh face.' Thus he would back away and not appear center stage as a candidate until more than a year later. ... It was a risky strategy and, judging by the results, a brilliant one."" Nixon would go on to narrowly win the 1968 election over Democrat Hubert Humphrey, but more importantly, he emerged from the Republican nomination process as the clear winner, trouncing Nelson Rockefeller, Ronald Reagan and Romney. Buchanan, who ran for president three times, said he does see some of Nixon's strategy in Clinton. ""I see her more looking at the scene, asking, 'Why move now,'"" he said. ""I think that whole idea is absence makes the heart grow fonder."" He added that he wasn't surprised Clinton, despite her work to impeach Nixon, has mixing his strategy. ""What dictates the strategy is more the circumstance and the individual,"" he said. ""This was not just a lark, this was thought though."" By ducking from public events -- Clinton had only two public events in January and has only one slated for February -- the frontrunner is clearly trying to lie low. Clinton has four events planned for March, but that number is nothing compared to how many events she headlined in 2014. Reports have surfaced that she may wait until summer to officially kick off a campaign, but Clinton confidants have told CNN that they expect some sort of campaign move to happen in April. The Nixon comparison favored by some close to Clinton -- but also causing some in Clinton-land to grimace -- have some . There are two obvious holes: The first being even if Clinton decides to lie low, today's media landscape doesn't have to abide by her wishes. Leaks about who she is hiring, where she may put her campaign headquarters and the problems she will face on the trail are rampant and the media is still as focused on her -- if not more -- than they were months ago. Secondly, unlike Nixon, Clinton's crowded field of realistic challengers isn't in the primary. On her Democratic side, Vice President Joe Biden, Democratic Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, Sen. Bernie Sanders from Vermont and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb haven't really made much a splash in polling, and one of her closest liberal competitors has repeatedly said she's not running. While Clinton finds herself with over 60% support, her next closest competitor, Biden, has gained six points since December and stands at 14%. Warren follows at 10%. Instead, the real crowded field facing Clinton comes mostly from Republicans, who have roughly two dozen possible hopefuls who might compete for the presidential nomination. While the media spotlight has burned a few contenders, it's unclear if those missteps on the GOP side will translate to Clinton's benefit once she finally decides to officially hop into the race. Quite simply, Clinton doesn't have a George Romney for the media to ""chew"" on.","Hillary Clinton's strategy of lying low has some Clinton supporters thinking of Richard Nixon's 1968 election .
Nixon chose to take a six-month hiatus from presidential politics before 1968 in order to allow the press to ""chew on"" George Romney .

"(CNN)Thai officials reiterated that the government is not cracking down on Cambodian workers in the country, as tens of thousands pour out of the country. Despite efforts to allay fears, about 180,000 Cambodians have fled Thailand since last week because of concerns over a possible crackdown on undocumented workers, according to estimates by International Organization for Migration, an intergovernmental organization on the issue. About 10,000 Cambodian migrants continue to flee from Thailand everyday, said Joe Lowry, spokesman for the International Organization for Migration. Combined with those who may have departed in private transport and cars, the number of those who've left since last week could be closer to 200,000, he said. Cambodian and Thai officials met Tuesday to discuss the issue, as thousands crammed into border towns, causing bottleneck congestion. ""People are in cramped area, in crowds of 3,000 to 4,000,"" Lowry said. ""It makes for an uneasy situation."" Chatter sparks fears . Earlier this week, many Cambodian migrant workers departing from the Thai border town of Aranyaprathet, told CNN they had heard rumors of arrests and persecution -- an allegation that Thai authorities deny. ""We don't have policies to arrest as has been widely reported,"" said Colonel Winthai Suwaree, a spokesman for the Thai army. ""I don't want us to get panicked. Initially, authorities will extend flexibilities and want to reassure that migrant workers can continue working as usual."" Winthai added that those who've left can return to their work. ""But we would ask employers to make a list of their employees in case authorities want to examine if it's necessary,"" he said. The majority of the 2.2 million workers legally eligible to work in Thailand are from Myanmar with 1.7 million and Cambodia with 438,000, according to the IOM. Thailand has a very low unemployment rate of 0.9%, according to the National Statistical Official of Thailand. Many of the foreigners work low-paying jobs that Thais are unwilling to do, but they are often vulnerable to police harassment and exploitation, advocates say. The Thai government has encouraged undocumented workers in the country to ""seek employment through proper channels,"" according to a statement. The junta plans to distribute leaflets in Khmer, Burmese and Laotian languages to explain their policies. Asia facing 'epidemic' of worker deaths, report warns . Post-coup panic . Thailand has been under the control of the military since a coup in late May. Although tackling illegal migration has been one of the junta's priorities, unease over the issue and the sudden change in the government may have fueled concerns and speculation, contributing to panic among Cambodian workers. It remains unclear where talk of a clampdown originated. Cambodia and Thailand have set up a hotline to handle the return of undocumented workers. Prior to the exodus, the IOM had estimated about 150,000 to 180,000 undocumented Cambodian workers in Thailand, which had been a ""conservative"" number, said Lowry. ""The numbers (of Cambodian workers leaving) could be slowing down because there's fewer people or because they started to stay. We don't really know,"" he said. In recent decades, relations between Cambodia and Thailand have been dogged by border issues, tensions over an area surrounding the ancient Preah Vihear temple, and the 2003 burning of the Thai embassy in Phnom Penh by rioters.","Organization: 180,000 Cambodian migrant workers leave Thailand .

"(CNN)Labor Secretary Tom Perez said Saturday he believes the U.S. economy can ""recover quickly"" from the months-long labor dispute that has crippled ports along the West Coast but acknowledged business owners across the country have already suffered losses. Perez helped broker a tentative contract agreement on Friday between dockworkers and their employers after President Barack Obama dispatched him to San Francisco this week. In an interview with CNN hours after the deal, Perez said he's spoken to many business owners whose livelihoods took a hit because of the protracted dispute. ""I'm ever mindful of the fact that there certainly has been some damage done,"" Perez said. ""If you talk to the citrus farmers whose citrus rotted on the port, that's damage that has been done."" Perez added, however, that he believes the conflict was resolved before it could do more permanent damage to country's 2015 economic outlook. ""2014 was the best year since the late 90s in terms of job growth and we see a real hop in the step of this economy,"" he said. ""I think in the grand scheme, I'm confident that we can recover quickly."" Contract negotiations between the Pacific Maritime Association, which represents shipping companies and port operators, and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which represents dock workers on the West Coast, started in May. The two parties were unable to come to an agreement and have been without a contract since July. The standoff has been a nightmare for U.S. businesses that use the West Coast ports to import and export their goods. For weeks, vessels carrying thousands of containers have been sitting on the waterfront waiting to be loaded or unloaded, and the problem grew exponentially worse when the PMA temporarily stopped all loading and unloading of ships this month. The heads of the PMA and ILWU hailed the agreement as ""good for workers and for the industry"" in a joint statement Friday. ""We are also pleased that our ports can now resume full operations,"" they said. Analysts say the process of clearing the ports of the existing congestion could take weeks, if not months. Perez, who has been labor secretary since 2013, told CNN that playing mediator in the West Coast ports dispute was ""among the most difficult"" challenges he has faced so far in office. ""Helping to facilitate resolution involves the development of mutual trust and so I had to do that and I had to do it fast because I didn't have the luxury of time,"" he said.","Tom Perez to CNN: Port strike won't cause permanent damage to economy .

"(CNN)Way out beyond Mars, but before you get to Jupiter, is a planet. You read that right. There's a planet between Mars and Jupiter. You may not have heard of it, but it was discovered in 1801 -- 129 years before Pluto. It originally was called a planet, then later an asteroid and now it's called a dwarf planet. Its name is Ceres (pronounced like series) and you'll likely be hearing a lot more about it in the coming weeks. Ceres is one of five named dwarf planets recognized by NASA and the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The other four are Eris, Pluto, Makemake and Haumea. But Ceres is the first of these worlds to get a visitor from Earth: NASA's Dawn spacecraft is arriving on March 6. ""Ceres is a 'planet' that you've probably never heard of,"" said Robert Mase, Dawn project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Ceres may be considered a dwarf planet, but it's ""the giant of the main asteroid belt,"" Dr. Marc Rayman, chief engineer and mission director of the Dawn mission, told CNN. ""It is not only the largest object between Mars and Jupiter, it is the largest object between the sun and Pluto that a spacecraft has not yet visited."" ""We are tremendously excited,"" Rayman said. ""We have guided this robotic probe for well over seven years on an interplanetary journey of more than 3 billion miles. Along the way we sailed past Mars. We spent 14 months orbiting and scrutinizing the giant protoplanet Vesta. ... Now, finally, we are on the verge of conducting the first exploration ever of the first dwarf planet."" Images taken on February 19 when Dawn was about 29,000 miles (46,000 kilometers) from Ceres show a bright spot on Ceres and a dimmer companion amid the small world's cratered surface. NASA says both spots appear to be in the same basin.  The images are puzzling to scientists and they say they'll have to wait until Dawn gets even closer to sort out the cause. ""We we will have to wait for better resolution before we can make such geologic interpretations,"" said Chris Russell, principal investigator for the Dawn mission, based at the University of California, Los Angeles. Rayman said Ceres' surface is pretty beaten up and that its craters are ""scars from life in the rough and tumble asteroid belt."" Why study a beaten-up space rock? Rayman said because it's a survivor -- and a mysterious one. Made up of rock and ice, Ceres may even have liquid water deep beneath its surface -- ""perhaps as ponds or lakes or even oceans,"" Rayman said. He said Ceres ""appears to have been in the process of growing to become a full-sized planet when Jupiter terminated its growth nearly 4.6 billion years ago."" So by studying Ceres, scientists learn more about how the rest of the solar system formed. And he said, we should study Ceres because it's there -- and we need to understand the universe we live in. ""We should study it because we hunger for knowledge and understanding. Grand undertakings like this nurture our spirit,"" Rayman said. Rayman said that if you had learned about the solar system 200 years ago, ""you would have learned that Ceres was a planet, just as people who learned about the solar system in more recent generations learned that Pluto is."" Speaking of Pluto, the most famous of the dwarf planets gets its own visitor in July. The New Horizons spacecraft is closing in for a flyby of Pluto and its moons. This talk of planets and dwarf planets is still a little confusing, so here's the most recent tally: NASA currently recognizes eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, and the five named dwarf planets we listed earlier. But a sixth possible dwarf planet already is on NASA's watch list. Called 2012 VP113, it's believed to be one of the most distant objects in our solar system. On its Solar System Exploration website, NASA says the object was nicknamed ""Biden"" after Vice President Joseph Biden because of the VP in its initial designation. It will be up to the IAU to decide whether i2012 VP113 is a dwarf planet and whether it gets an official name. But expect the numbers for planets in our solar system to keep changing. Mike Brown, the CalTech astronomy professor who helped discover dwarf planet Eris and who takes responsibility for killing off Pluto as a full-fledged planet, has his own tally listing more than 360 possible dwarf planets. And NASA has said there may be many more dwarf planets that we haven't found yet. So Ceres, and its cousins, may soon outnumber the traditional planets you learned about in grade school.","NASA spacecraft is closing in on tiny world Ceres .

"(CNN)Houthi rebels, who deposed Yemen's government by force, have come to a preliminary agreement for a new government, showing willingness to negotiate, a U.N. official said Friday. It's a breakthrough, said envoy Jamal Benomar. But it's not a final deal. Parties to the negotiations are hopeful it will prevent a civil war. It represents a shift of the Houthis' tone from just a month ago, when they stormed the capital Sanaa with guns blazing. After a years-long conflict with the government, the rebels attacked the residences of President Abdurabu Hadi and Prime Minister Khaled Bahah last month. When the two refused to concede the Houthis' political demands, the rebels, who are Shiites in a majority Sunni nation, forced them to resign. The offensive and takeover stunned governments in the West, who, along with other countries, pulled out diplomatic staff. Houthi fighters took U.S. Embassy vehicles and would not let departing Marines take their weapons with them. But Western governments have other worries as well. Yemen's former government was allied with the United States and other Western and Middle Eastern powers in the fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- who are Sunni Islamist extremists. There has been little sign so far of how willing to negotiate the Shia Zaidi Houthis, who are supported by Iran and who have been secessionists, might be. The U.N. envoy is helping broker the preliminary agreement between Houthi leaders and the independent, relatively new Justice and Building Party. The Houthis applied pressure to get results, threatening to escalate violence, if no deal were reached, said Justice and Building Party spokesman Baligh al-Mikhlafi. ""This deal is not perfect, but it ensures that Yemen does not collapse,"" he said. The agreement outlines only rough points. ""There are still a number of issues on the dialogue table that must be agreed on dealing with the government and presidency as well guarantees for the implementation of the deal,"" Benomar said. Yemen's legislative body, the National Congress, will get a second chamber -- a brand new parliament. The Houthis, who live in Yemen's north, will get 50% of the seats and concede 50% to the country's south. Half of seats will go to the country's women and youths, Benomar said. The current House of Representatives will remain as it is for now. The U.N. had called for Houthi fighters to withdraw from government institutions it had captured. Whatever the military concessions, the agreement allows Houthi gunmen to remain in Sanaa.","Houthi rebels depose Yemen's government in surprise attack in January .

"(CNN)The U.S. military will deploy 400 trainers and hundreds more troops in a train-and-equip mission for Syrian rebel forces, the Pentagon said Friday. The American troops will be deployed starting in early spring on six- to eight-week missions in three countries -- Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia -- as part of the Obama administration's plan to expand training for moderate Syrian rebels. Those groups are battling forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and extremist groups such as ISIS, as well as others linked to al Qaeda. The mission would be led by the military and complement a modest CIA training program, based on what was authorized by the White House more than a year ago. ""Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar have agreed to host training sites, and we anticipate the program to train and equip the moderate Syrian opposition will take approximately 400 U.S. trainers, with the caveat that this number could fluctuate based on course load, course requirements and other variables,"" said Cmdr. Elissa Smith, a Pentagon spokeswoman. ""We also anticipate that the trainers will have enablers. We expect to begin training in early spring."" The trainers focused on Syria will join up to 3,000 American troops that were authorized by President Barack Obama last year to act as anti-ISIS fighters in Iraq, which shares a border with Syria. American involvement in the battle against ISIS has been more robust in Iraq, where the government has requested assistance. American planes have conducted numerous bombing missions in both countries. This new training program is meant to help ""moderate Syrian fighters"" target ISIS. The moderate fighters are also at war against al-Assad, whom the Obama administration also wants to see defeated. But in her statement, Smith didn't mention al-Assad as a target of the U.S. training mission. ""The goal for the train and equip program is to build the capabilities of the moderate Syrian fighters to defend the Syrian people; stabilize areas under opposition control; promote the conditions for a negotiated settlement of the conflict in Syria; and empower trainees to go on the offensive against ISIL,"" she said, using the U.S. government term for ISIS. U.S. officials have said that vetting the rebels who take part in the program will play an important role to assure they do not share any dual allegiances to Jabbat al-Nusra, al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, or any other militant groups. Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, has said training the vetted rebels could take eight to 12 months before they are ready to return to Syria for the fight against ISIS. CNN's Chloe Sommers, Z. Byron Wolf and Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.","Obama administration wants to train moderate Syrian rebels .

"(CNN)Dockworkers at West Coast ports have reached a tentative contract agreement to end their labor dispute, a spokesman for the Pacific Maritime Association said Friday. ""A deal has been struck. An official statement is forthcoming,"" Steve Getzug said. The five-year contract still has to be approved by the dockworkers union members. The dispute had centered around contract negotiations between the Pacific Maritime Association, which represents shipping companies and port operators, and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which represents West Coast dockworkers. The two parties began talks in May but were unable to reach an agreement and had been operating without a contract since July. Operations have been affected at 29 ports. U.S. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez was in San Francisco to help mediate the dispute. ""They're already working but they'll be back in full force tomorrow,"" Perez said. ""And I am confident that up and down the West Coast there is an acute awareness of the need to reduce the backlog (of ships needing to be unloaded). And that is job one."" The Port of Oakland said on its website that it could take six to eight weeks for the situation at its facility to return to normal. ""Ships, containers and chassis are all out of balance. They're not where they need to be to support cargo movement. Repositioning of these assets will take some time,"" the port said on its Maritime Operational Status page.","Contract is for five years, awaits vote of union members .

"(CNN) -- Robin Williams -- who first made America laugh and eventually touched ""every element of the human spirit"" in a remarkable range of performances -- died at his Northern California home Monday. Williams apparently took his own life, law enforcement officials said. He was 63. ""He has been battling severe depression of late,"" his media representative Mara Buxbaum told CNN. ""This is a tragic and sudden loss. The family respectfully asks for their privacy as they grieve during this very difficult time."" Coroner investigators suspect ""the death to be a suicide due to asphyxia,"" according to a statement from the Marin County, California, Sheriff's Office. Williams married graphic designer Susan Schneider in Napa Valley, California, ceremony in October 2011. ""This morning, I lost my husband and my best friend, while the world lost one of its most beloved artists and beautiful human beings. I am utterly heartbroken,"" Schneider said. ""On behalf of Robin's family, we are asking for privacy during our time of profound grief. As he is remembered, it is our hope the focus will not be on Robin's death, but on the countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions."" Word of Williams' death stunned the entertainment community and beyond Monday. President Barack Obama's statement sent from the White House summed it up: . ""Robin Williams was an airman, a doctor, a genie, a nanny, a president, a professor, a bangarang Peter Pan, and everything in between.  But he was one of a kind. He arrived in our lives as an alien -- but he ended up touching every element of the human spirit.  He made us laugh.  He made us cry.  He gave his immeasurable talent freely and generously to those who needed it most -- from our troops stationed abroad to the marginalized on our own streets."" Comedian Steve Martin tweeted, ""I could not be more stunned by the loss of Robin Williams, mensch, great talent, acting partner, genuine soul."" Former CNN host Larry King said he would remember Williams as ""a genuine caring guy.  Not just a funny man, but a guy who cared about people."" Marin County deputies responded to an emergency call from Williams' home in unincorporated Tiburon, California, at 11:55 a.m., reporting ""a male adult had been located unconscious and not breathing,"" the release from the sheriff said. Williams was pronounced dead at 12:02 p.m., it said. Williams was last seen alive at his home, where he lives with his wife, at about 10 p.m. Sunday, the sheriff's statement said. ""An investigation into the cause, manner and circumstances of the death is currently underway by the Investigations and Coroner Divisions of the Sheriff's Office,"" the sheriff's statement said. ""Coroner Division suspects the death to be a suicide due to asphyxia, but a comprehensive investigation must be completed before a final determination is made."" An autopsy is scheduled for Tuesday, the sheriff said. Williams made at least two trips to rehab for drug treatment, including a visit this summer, and he underwent heart surgery in 2009. Williams, born in Chicago on July 21, 1951, studied theater at Juilliard School before taking his stand up act to nightclubs. He was cast as Mork, an alien visitor to Earth, for a 1978 episode of television's ""Happy Days."" ""Happy Days"" star Henry Winkler said it was ""unimaginable that this is the reality today, that this incredible human being, incredible, delicate, funny, dramatic human being is gone."" Winkler said he ""realized I was in the presence of greatness"" at Williams' first rehearsal as Mork. ""I just realized my only job is to keep a straight face,"" said Winkler, who played ""The Fonz."" ""And it was impossible. Because no matter what you said to him, no matter what line you gave to him, he took it in, processed it, and then it flew out of his mouth, never the same way twice. And it was incredibly funny every time."" The role led to the spin-off show ""Mork & Mindy,"" which showcased Williams' usual comic improvisation talents. He proved his dramatic acting skills in ""Good Will Hunting,"" a 1997 film that earned him a best supporting actor Oscar. His memorable movies over the past three decades includes ""Good Morning, Vietnam,"" ""Dead Poets Society,"" ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" and ""The Birdcage."" The list is much longer. Williams credited the influence of Jonathan Winters' comic irreverence and quirky characters as a great influence on his comedy. The connection between the two was completed when Winters was cast as Williams' son on ""Mork & Mindy."" When Winters died in 2013, Williams said he was ""my idol, then he was my mentor and amazing friend."" He tweeted that Winters was his ""Comedy Buddha."" ""Mork & Mindy"" co-star Pam Dawber simply said ""I am completely and totally devastated. What more can be said?"" WIlliams and Dawber reunited on TV earlier this year on an episode of the CBS comedy ""The Crazy Ones."" Williams' fans can look forward to four more movie appearances coming to theaters, including another installment in the ""Night at the Museum"" franchise. The film, set for a December release, has Williams reprising the Teddy Roosevelt role he delivered in the first two comedies. Share your memories of Robin Williams .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)Deposed Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi escaped house arrest in the country's capital early Saturday and fled to the southern province of Aden, where he is expected to withdraw his resignation in a televised speech in the next 24 hours, two of his advisers said. Hadi, who had been under house arrest since he resigned under pressure from Houthi rebels in the capital, Sanaa, last month, fled with the help of forces loyal to him at about 4 a.m., one of his advisers said on condition of anonymity. A senior Houthi official confirmed Hadi's escape. Houthis are working to capture him in Aden, said that official, also speaking on condition of anonymity. Later Saturday, the news network Al Jazeera reported it received a paper statement from Hadi in Aden -- a statement in which he effectively declared himself to still be President. According to Al Jazeera, Hadi said all political decisions made since September 21 -- the start of what he called a Houthi coup -- are invalid. That would include his under-pressure resignation. Details about how Hadi slipped away from house arrest -- he had been under guard by Houthi security personnel -- were not immediately available. No fighting was reported in connection with his escape. Hadi intends to withdraw his resignation in a televised speech this weekend, two of his advisers said Saturday. ""President Hadi escaped from his residence after the Houthis arrested him and oppressed him and his family,"" one of the advisers said on condition of anonymity. ""He is the constitutional president of Yemen, and he has the constitutional capacity to withdraw his resignation."" Such a move would further complicate the question of who runs the country. The capital has been held for weeks by the Houthis, a minority rebel group that holds sway in the nation's north but has far less influence elsewhere. Hadi and Prime Minister Khaled Bahah resigned in January under Houthi pressure, a few months after the rebels entered the capital with guns blazing, demanding greater political influence. Houthis are Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni Muslim country. They had been at war with the central government for more than a decade, but their entry into Sanaa in September brought things to a head, sparking battles that left than 300 people dead before a ceasefire was agreed that month. Houthis then pressured Hadi and Bahah to step down last month after the pair refused to agree to certain political demands. The Houthis' takeover of Sanaa stunned governments of Western nations, which, along with other countries, pulled out diplomatic staff this month. As part of an investigation into Hadi's escape, Houthis on Saturday arrested dozens of their own security personnel who were responsible for watching him, the senior Houthi official said. Houthis arrested two people connected to Hadi -- his media secretary Yahya Al Arassi and Hadi's private physician -- after his escape, one of Hadi's advisers said. A senior official with a Sunni political party opposed to the Houthi takeover said that he backs Hadi's claim to the presidency. ""Hadi's withdrawal (of his resignation) would save the country and end the Houthi oppression of the Yemeni people,"" said Mohammed Al Sabri, senior official of the Nasserite party. Houthis have been pressuring the parliament to formally accept Hadi's resignation, a step that has not yet happened. Parliament will do no such thing, prominent lawmaker Abdu Al Huthafi, a Sunni Muslim, said Saturday. ""Hadi informed political alliances ... that he will withdraw his resignation in the right time, and that could be very soon,"" Al Huthafi said. Before news of Hadi's escape spread in Sanaa in the late morning, about 6,000 demonstrators marched in Sanaa's streets against the Houthis. Anti-Houthi protests also took place in four other provinces -- Taiz, Ibb, Al Baitha and Dhammar -- protest organizers there said. There already had been resistance to the Houthis' attempted takeover of national government institutions from different groups in Yemen, particularly in the south, where there's a long-running secessionist movement. Also opposed to the Houthis are the Sunni terror group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which exerts influence over many rural areas stretching from the country's southwest to the northeast. AQAP vowed to attack Houthi loyalists nationwide last year. Yemen's political turmoil could have an impact on the United States' fight against AQAP. The United States has long had a relationship with Yemen's leaders, working with them to target AQAP militants. It's not clear what the Houthis' takeover of Sanaa means for U.S. anti-terrorism efforts, but the drone program there still appears to be active. A U.S. drone strike killed senior AQAP cleric Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhari and three other people in Shabwa province on January 31. CNN's Hakim Almasmari reported from Yemen and Jason Hanna reported and wrote in Atlanta.

"(CNN)President Barack Obama sought to reclaim some ownership over an issue that is suddenly a hot topic among top Republicans, telling an audience on Friday that he welcomes his rival party focusing on income inequality, but questioned whether it was anything more than talk. ""Now that their grand predictions of doom and gloom and death panels and Armageddon haven't come true. The sky hasn't fallen, chicken little is quiet,"" Obama said. ""The new plan is to re-brand themselves as the party of the middle class. I am not making this up."" To laughs from the Democratic National Committee audience in Washington, D.C., Obama added: ""I am encouraged they are speaking about middle class and about wages. But there is this old saying, you can't just talk the talk. ... You've got to walk the walk."" Income inequality and the growing gap between the richest and poorest Americans has become a primary issue in the 2016 election and many Republicans vying for the party's nomination have focused on the issue. The comments have not gone unnoticed by Democrats and the White House. ""We're facing right now a divided America when it comes to the economy,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, after Obama's January address to the nation. ""Income inequality has worsened under this administration,"" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, said after the President's State of the Union speech. On Friday, Obama took on Paul directly, noting that the 2016 hopeful once said his party needs to show up ""up on the South Side of Chicago"" and shout ""at the top of our lungs: 'We are the party of jobs and opportunity.'"" ""I think that is encouraging that he wants to go to the South Side of Chicago,"" Obama said with a smile. ""I was just home on the South Side of Chicago yesterday and I guarantee you that Senator Paul would be welcome there. We are a friendly bunch."" Obama added: ""I mean, it is a little strange if people show up and just start shouting on the top of their lungs. But we are friendly, it would be OK."" When Obama first mentioned Paul, some in the audience groaned at his name. Hearing this, Obama said, ""No, Rand is an interesting guy."" The President views the improving economy after a difficult recession as a potential cornerstone of his legacy. In the foreword to a report on the nation's brightening fiscal picture from the White House Counsel of Economic Advisors, Obama writes ""the United States has just concluded a breakthrough year."" RELATED: Elizabeth Warren's supporters look for their next win . Obama has made fewer references to the issue of income inequality in recent months in favor the term ""middle class economics,"" which was a major theme of his State of the Union speech. Aides to the President insist GOP leaders have flocked to the issue of income inequality only in an attempt to diminish Democratic claims to the nation's improving economy. Before the speech, a White House official said Obama would use his DNC speech to call out Republicans for what he sees as hypocrisy. ""So far, at least, the rhetoric has not matched the reality,"" Obama said on Friday. ""I think the shift in rhetoric that they are engaging in is good, if it actually leads them to take different actions. If it doesn't, then it is just spin."" The President also seemed to lightly touch on recent comments by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who said earlier this week that he doesn't think President Barack Obama ""loves America."" ""This is not just a sports contest, this Is not just who's up and down at any given point, it's not about notches on a belt, it's not about ideological battles an proving how smart you are,"" Obama said. ""It's about making this nation we love more perfect."" Republicans, in response to most positive economic numbers, have said there are still glaring vulnerabilities in the nation's recovery. ""After spending the last six years growing Washington instead of the middle class, it's no surprise President Obama can only point fingers rather than point to meaningful success,"" said Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short. ""The reality is Americans have suffered under the slowest economic recovery in modern times, and on his watch, the middle class lost its status as being the world's richest as more and more families fall out rather than move up."" House Republicans have had a similar response to the President's message. ""There's a reason why the Democratic Party has lost the House, the Senate, governorships, and more than 900 state legislative seats in recent years. President Obama's liberal agenda has left America's working class families behind,"" Boehner spokesman Cory Fritz said.","President Obama said he welcomed Republicans talking about income inequality ""if it actually leads them to take different actions""

"(CNN)A fire broke out early Saturday at a luxury apartment skyscraper in Dubai, engulfing several floors on at least three sides of the iconic Torch building and spewing flaming debris to the ground. There were no deaths or injuries, and the fire was out three hours after it began, the Dubai Civil Defense said. The cause was not known, the Dubai Civil Defense said. The fire started at 2 a.m. (5 p.m. ET Friday), when many people were out and enjoying the nightlife in unseasonably warm temperatures, witness Leah Polonenko said. She shot video of the fire that showed flaming debris spilling from the 79-story building shortly after the fire started. The fire appeared to start around the 50th floor, but then strong winds blew the burning debris around to lower floors on other sides, witnesses said. At least four nearby buildings were evacuated as a precaution, Polonenko said. Hundreds of people, many of them evacuated residents, were in the street while emergency crews were on the scene. The Torch was the world's tallest residential tower when it was completed in 2011, according to the building's developer, Select Group. It contains 676 residential units with 24-hour security and concierge, and six retail spaces. A resident of a nearby building told CNN he was watching a movie when he saw the fire. ""We went to the balcony, then it was one side of the building (that) was burning,"" Jaime Mueller, 30, told CNN by phone. ""We went downstairs and a lot of people were watching,"" he said.

"(CNN)Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said his office has received death threats since his controversial comments accusing President Barack Obama of not loving America. ""My secretary has received some death threats,"" Giuliani said in a brief interview by phone. But the former mayor emphasized the majority of the voice mails left at his office were supportive of his remarks. Giuliani did not say whether he alerted police to the threatening calls. CNN cannot confirm whether the threats were made. As for his initial remarks that ignited the firestorm, spoken at a private dinner for Wisconsin's Republican Gov. Scott Walker, a potential 2016 presidential contender, Giuliani offered no apologies. ""I don't regret making the statement. I believe it,"" Giuliani said. ""I don't know if he loves America,"" he added. ""I don't feel the same enthusiasm from him for America,"" he continued during the interview. Giuliani said he didn't mind that his comments became public.  At the dinner, he said, were well-known members of the news media, including CNBC anchor Larry Kudlow who, Giuliani said, was the event's moderator. The former mayor said he's received calls congratulating him for his remarks, including one from Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. A spokesman for the Louisiana governor confirms Jindal did speak with Giuliani by phone.  While the spokesman said Jindal did not endorse everything the former mayor said about Obama, he added the governor also has deep concerns about the president's leadership on Islamist radicalism. ""The Governor did call him and they did speak,"" spokesman Curt Anderson said. ""(Jindal) wanted to buck him up because he knows everyone is in a rush to condemn him.  The Governor acknowledges that not everything that the Mayor said was good, but he believes that Guiliani is a great leader and that this rush by the left and the media to condemn and marginalize him is ridiculous,"" Anderson said. ""In short, the Governor is not going to throw Guiliani overboard for saying some inadvisable things,"" Anderson continued. Jindal, according to this spokesman,""believes that the President loves this country and that the President has proven to be an inept and incapable commander in chief."" Anderson says Jindal agrees that ""Guiliani asked a very important question which the press has glossed over -- it was this -- 'What's wrong with this man that he can't stand up and say there's a part of Islam that's sick?'"" ""The Governor believes this is question that needs to be answered,"" Anderson said. John Catsimatidis, a tycoon in the grocery store industry who sponsored the event, also called to say Giuliani was saying what was on other people's minds, the former mayor added. Earlier this week, the former mayor laid into Obama's foreign policy as coming from a leader who is somehow disenchanted with the country he leads. ""I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the President loves America. He doesn't love you. And he doesn't love me. He wasn't brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country,"" Giuliani said at the dinner. Giuliani's Obama critique puts 2016ers in a bind . In his latest comments to CNN, Giuliani noted he is not running for president in 2016.  But he tried to explain why he made the comments. Giuliani said he was disgusted with Obama's response to the executions of Egyptian Coptic Christians by ISIS and the attack on a Jewish market in Paris by radicals inspired by the terrorist group. The President erred, Giuliani maintains, in not holding a press conference to immediately denounce those acts of terrorism. ""Islamic extremism is not an abstraction,"" he continued. By contrast, Giuliani pointed out, the President did make comments to the press after the racial unrest in Ferguson, Missouri. ""There's something wrong with the rhetoric here,"" Giuliani said. ""I think the President is a very poor leader,"" Giuliani added, saying Obama doesn't measure up to past presidents Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton. Opinion: Giuliani's outburst is ugly, divisive . Giuliani said some of his comments were based on Obama's autobiography, ""Dreams of My Father,"" which he said he read during the 2008 campaign at the urging of his wife, who predicted the then-Illinois senator would be the Democratic nominee. Giuliani said the White House owes him an apology after stating that he had made similar remarks about Obama during the 2008 campaign. Giuliani said that claim from White House spokesman Eric Schultz was not true. ""I think they should apologize to me,"" Giuliani said. On Friday, the White House sharply criticized Giuliani's comments. ""I can tell you that it's sad to see when somebody who has attained a certain level of public stature, and even admiration, tarnishes that legacy so thoroughly,"" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. ""And the truth is, I don't take any joy, or vindication, or satisfaction from that. I think, really, the only thing that I feel is I feel sorry for Rudy Giuliani today,"" Earnest added.

The suspension comes after a court determined Busch committed an act of domestic violence against his former girlfriend, Patricia Driscoll, NASCAR officials told CNN. ""Given the serious nature of the findings and conclusions made by the Commissioner of the Family Court of the State of Delaware, NASCAR has indefinitely suspended driver Kurt Busch, effective immediately,"" NASCAR said in a news release. Busch's attorney, Rusty Hardin, said in a written statement that his client will immediately appeal NASCAR's decision. ""We assure everyone, including NASCAR, that this action against Mr. Busch will turn out to be a travesty of justice, apparent to all, as this story continues to unfold,"" Hardin said. NASCAR will expedite any appeal, NASCAR Executive Vice President Steve O'Donnell told reporters. ""NASCAR has made it very clear to our entire membership ... that any actions of abuse will not be tolerated,"" O'Donnell said. The racing season officially begins Sunday with the Daytona 500. Busch could still race if his suspension is overturned in the appeals process. Busch was accused by Driscoll of grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head into a wall three times while they were in Busch's motor home at Dover International Speedway in October. The judge in the civil case found her story to be true, ESPN reported. Hardin's statement said Driscoll had lied during her testimony and she had tried to intimidate witnesses. In 2004, Busch captured the Cup series title, winning NASCAR's first postseason 10-race tournament.

"(CNN) -- When Brazilian ace Neymar signed with Barcelona in May, observers wondered if he could develop a potent partnership with four-time player of the year Lionel Messi. So far, so good for the tandem. Neymar scored his first league goal and set up Messi as Barcelona defeated Champions League side Real Sociedad 4-1 to maintain its perfect record in Spain's La Liga through six matches. Neymar has now logged at least one assist in four straight league games -- and three times Messi has been the grateful beneficiary. Messi particularly likes playing against Sociedad, too, netting every time he has faced them at the Camp Nou since Sociedad earned promotion in 2010. And a few days after Barcelona had less possession than the opposition for the first time in more than five years, order was restored -- Gerardo Martino's men enjoyed 71 percent of the ball. Real Sociedad, now winless in the league since the opening weekend, struck the crossbar in the second minute but it was mostly one-way traffic at the other end thereafter. Neymar bundled home the opener in the fifth minute, taking advantage of some indecision by keeper Claudio Bravo, and Messi's diving header from Neymar's floated cross doubled the advantage in the eighth minute. Messi could have had a hat-trick within 40 minutes but he hit the crossbar from close range -- holding midfielder Sergio Busquets scored from outside the box seconds later for only his fifth league goal in five years -- and failed to connect cleanly after Barcelona cut open the Sociedad defense. Messi then almost scored from another Neymar pass but saw his effort blocked. The Argentine, following a typically driving run, pulled his jersey over his head after he blazed over the bar in the 52nd. Alberto de la Bella pulled a goal back in the 64th minute but defender Marc Bartra -- replacing the injured Javier Mascherano -- restored the three-goal lead in the 77th with Messi's help. Difficult for Dortmund . It hasn't been the best of weeks for Borussia Dortmund. The Champions League finalist lost its opener in the European competition to Napoli last Wednesday and dropped its first points in the Bundesliga on Saturday. And Dortmund needed extra time to see off second-tier 1860 Munich 2-0 in the German Cup on Tuesday despite fielding a starting lineup that included Robert Lewandowski, Marco Reus and Henrik Mkhitaryan. Dortmund, mind you, did register almost 40 shots, compared to 1860's two in Munich, and struck the bar four times. Substitute Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored from the penalty spot -- Dominik Stahl fouled Reus and was sent off -- before fellow summer signing Mkhitaryan made it 2-0 to book Dortmund's spot in the last 16.","Barcelona maintains its perfect record in Spain's La Liga by beating Real Sociedad 4-1 .

"(CNN)The Oscar statuette, seen by many as the film industry's highest honor, has been given a new and biting spin by a Los Angeles street artist. Plastic Jesus -- the artist prefers not to go by his real name -- showcased a life-size Oscar-inspired statue snorting what is intended to look like cocaine on Hollywood Boulevard, just blocks from where the Academy Awards will take place Sunday. The golden figure is bent over a line of white powder with a credit card lying nearby. A placard underneath the statue reads, 'Hollywood's Best Party.' The display lasted on the sidewalk near the Dolby Theatre for five hours Thursday before it was removed, but Plastic Jesus hopes his work made a clear statement before Sunday's biggest bash. ""The Oscars is a very glitzy, high-profile event, so I wanted to bring attention to cocaine use in Hollywood,"" the artist told CNN. ""It's part of the culture here."" Last year, Plastic Jesus came up with a similar stunt to address ""the covering up of drug use in Hollywood."" In that installation, the Oscar statue had a needle in its arm, appearing to be shooting up heroin. It was said to be inspired by Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman, who had died in New York weeks prior from acute mixed drug intoxication (both heroin and cocaine were contributing factors in his death). Plastic Jesus is a former photojournalist from London, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Before he set out to expose Hollywood, he created similar social commentary through graffiti featuring Lance Armstrong with an IV bag attached to his arm, a reference to doping allegations against the bicyclist. ""We only hear about (drug abuse) when high-profile people in Hollywood have a meltdown, check into rehab, or die,"" Plastic Jesus tells CNN. Celebrity substance abuse confessions . ""There is a fear among these people that their careers will be ruined if they admit that they have a drug problem."" Plastic Jesus believes that his art work has the potential to make important change in Hollywood, and beyond. ""Hopefully, my work will help people who have a problem and think they're alone, but also make a difference on a governmental level. They are not doing enough."" CNN made multiple attempts to reach the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for comment, as it is famously protective of images of the Oscar statuette. Plastic Jesus says he has received a lot of support from within the entertainment industry.","Artist Plastic Jesus showcases an Oscar-inspired statue snorting what looks like cocaine .

"(CNN)The family of a girl who UK police say may be headed to Syria with two friends have a message for her: We're not mad at you, and please come home. UK police said 15-year-old Shamima Begum and two other London girls took a flight to Istanbul from London Gatwick Airport on Tuesday. Their families have reported them missing, and London's Metropolitan Police say the girls are believed to be heading to Syria, where militant groups and government forces are locked in a war, and parts of which have been taken over by the Islamist terror group ISIS. ""We miss you terribly and are extremely worried about you,"" Shamima's family said in a statement that Metropolitan Police released Saturday. ""Please, if you hear this message, get in touch and let us know you are safe. We want you home with us. You belong at home with us. ""Syria is a dangerous place and we don't want you to go there. Get in touch with the police and they will help to bring you home. You are not in any trouble."" The family said it understands that Shamima has strong feelings about wanting to help those she believes are suffering in Syria. ""You can help from home, you don't have to put yourself in danger,"" the statement reads. ""Please don't cross the border. Please come home to us. Our Mum needs you home and is really worried. We are not mad at you, we love you."" Police said Shamima might be traveling under the name of 17-year-old Aklima Begum. Shamima is traveling with Kadiza Sultana, 16, and a third girl whose name police withheld at her family's request. On Friday, police released pictures of the three girls walking together through Gatwick Airport, carrying travel bags. Police say they are close friends who went to the same East London school. ""We are extremely concerned for the safety of these young girls and would urge anyone with information to come forward and speak to police. Our priority is the safe return of these girls to their families,"" Metropolitan Police Cmdr. Richard Walton said Friday. ""We are reaching out to the girls using the Turkish media and social media in the hope that Shamima, Kadiza and their friend hear our messages, hear our concerns for their safety and have the courage to return now, back to their families who are so worried about them."" UK police are concerned about the number of girls and young women trying to head to areas of Syria controlled by ISIS, Walton said. ""It is an extremely dangerous place, and we have seen reports of what life is like for them and how restricted their lives become,"" he said.

"(CNN)Armed groups raided a South Sudanese school and seized 89 children who were taking their exams, the United Nations said Saturday. The abduction occurred near Malakal, where thousands of people have taken refuge following months of violence in the nation. Kidnappers gathered around a community and conducted house-to-house searches, according to the U.N. children's agency. It said the victims included boys over age 12, who were taken away by force. U.N. officials warned the abductors that they're violating international law. ""The recruitment and use of children by armed forces destroys families and communities,"" said Jonathan Veitch, the UNICEF representative in South Sudan. ""Children are exposed to incomprehensible levels of violence, they lose their families and their chance to go to school."" South Sudan has been embroiled in conflict since December 2013, when President Salva Kiir accused his fired deputy, Riek Machar, of trying to oust him through a coup. Since then, militia loyal to both have battled each others' forces. Violence has quickly spread, with reports of mass killings and starvation nationwide. Talks and repeated pleas for peace have yielded no results. More than 1.5 million people have been displaced, according to the U.N., and thousands killed. Some civilians have fled to U.N. bases in the country, making the facilities targets for armed militants. South Sudan seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war, making it the world's youngest nation. Since the split, the nation has battled various setbacks, including violence divided along tribal lines -- the Nuer community backs rebel leader Machar while the President is from the Dinka tribe. The warring sides have signed ceasefire deals, but the bloodshed continues.","South Sudan has been embroiled in conflict since 2013 .

"(CNN) -- A Syrian army helicopter dropped barrel bombs on a vegetable market in Aleppo on Thursday, killing 24 people, opposition activists said. Dozens more were injured in the attack on the opposition-held town of Atareb, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria. Barrel bombs, which are drums packed with explosives and shrapnel, can level entire buildings with one hit. Rescue efforts were under way as volunteers used bulldozers to clear wreckage and remove the rubble of the bombed buildings, according to the opposition. It posted purported videos of the attacks on social media. Another airstrike targeted the nearby village of Tal Rifaat, the group said. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the reports or the videos. The attack comes days after several U.S. officials said the Syrian government may have used chlorine gas in a deadly attack on its people. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the United States ""had indications of the use of a toxic industrial chemical, probably chlorine, in Syria this month in the opposition-dominated village of Kfar Zeita."" If true, a chlorine attack would undermine a deal brokered by Russia last fall and approved by the U.N. Security Council that requires Syria to surrender its chemical weapons to the international community. The Syrian opposition does not have helicopters to carry and deliver such weapons, and has been trading accusations about the April 11 chlorine incident with the government. The United Nations says more than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria since the opposition launched anti-government protests in 2011.","Barrel bombs are drums packed with explosives and shrapnel .

"(CNN)Kurt Busch, NASCAR's 2004 Cup champion, lost both appeals of his indefinite suspension and will miss Sunday's season-opening Daytona 500, the auto racing circuit said late Saturday. Busch twice challenged NASCAR's decision Friday to ban him after a Delaware civil court found he likely committed domestic violence against  former girlfriend Patricia Driscoll. An initial appeal was denied by a three-member panel. A second request for reinstatement was heard Saturday by NASCAR's final appeals officer and  also denied. NASCAR has not announced what Busch will have to do to be reinstated. Busch's attorney said after the first appeal was denied that his client will challenge the court's decision. ""We will continue to exhaust every procedural and legal remedy we have available to us until Kurt Busch is vindicated.  Along the way, we intend to continue to call attention to the facts and witnesses that will shed light on Ms. Driscoll's true character, motivations and history,"" Rusty Hardin said. The suspension was announced Friday after the family court's decision. Hardin said then that the court's decision ""will turn out to be a travesty of justice."" NASCAR Executive Vice President Steve O'Donnell told reporters Friday: ""NASCAR has made it very clear to our entire membership ... that any actions of abuse will not be tolerated.""

His Cup team, Stewart-Haas Racing, said Regan Smith would replace him in the No. 41 car on Sunday. Busch's brother, Kyle, also will not race Sunday, and perhaps for months.

"(CNN)Don't try to drive over these bridges. These rocky natural spans were formed over millennia by the flowing waters of a stream or other water source, which slowly eroded away the rock to create the shape of a bridge. But are they arches or bridges? The Natural Arch and Bridge Society, whose Indiana Jones-like members go hunting for these rock formations around the world, makes this distinction: A natural arch is made of rock, with a hole formed by natural forces, they say. A natural bridge is a type of arch, where water is the natural force making the hole. Erosion created these magnificent structures, and erosion will eventually take them down. One such wonder was Aruba's Natural Bridge, which was first formed by pounding surf eroding its coral limestone. The 100-foot-span gave way and collapsed in 2005.  (The smaller Baby Bridge is still standing nearby.) Here are 15 spectacular natural bridges around the world. America's crazy rock formations . Green Bridge of Wales, United Kingdom . One of the most famous spots in Wales, the Green Bridge of Wales and the rocky Pembrokeshire coastline, are part of a national park. Nearby you can also spot the Stack Rocks, known as the Elegug Stacks in Welsh. Eventually it's expected that the ocean will wear away the Green Bridge and the middle will collapse, turning it into stacks. Visitors who continue along the coast to see Pen-y-Holt Stack should note that it's in a British Army range and must be visited through walks organized by the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority. Ayres Natural Bridge, Wyoming . Not all the glory of Wyoming is found at its two internationally famous Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks in the northwestern part of the state. Less well-known but worth the visit is the majestic Ayres Natural Bridge in eastern Wyoming, about 40 miles east of Casper. The 50-foot tall, 100-foot-long natural bridge over LaPrele Creek is the star of this 22-acre park. Natural Bridges National Monument, Utah . As streams cut into the canyon walls and flash floods further weakened them, the three mighty bridges at Natural Bridges National Monument in the southeastern corner of Utah were carved over millions of years. The area was declared a national monument in 1908, and the three bridges were given the Hopi names ""Owachomo,"" ""Kachina"" and ""Sipapu"" in 1909. Further erosion has made the once thick and mighty Owachomo Bridge more delicate. While still massive and strong, Kachina Bridge did lose 4,000 tons of rock in 1992. Pont d'Arc, France . A natural bridge formed by the Ardeche River in the south of France, the Pont d'Arc has a world-famous neighbor: the Chauvet cave paintings, the world's oldest known such works, which date back 36,000 years. Top 25 amusement parks around the world . Discovered in 1994, the site was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site this year. But the region's natural beauty is also a national treasure. Classified as a French national heritage site in 1982, the 54-meter-long (177-foot-long) natural arch is the only French example of a natural bridge spanning a still-flowing river. It's also a gateway to the river canyon. Natural Bridges State Beach, California . A famous natural bridge anchors this Santa Cruz beach, which is best known for its tide pools -- go exploring at low tide -- and seasonal monarch butterfly residents. Up to 100,000 monarchs typically move into the state beach's Monarch Grove in mid-October, and they depart the following January or February. There's a party in October to welcome them, and seasonal tours are available. London Bridge, Australia . Australia's Port Campbell National Park is best known for the Twelve Apostles, towering limestone rock stacks carved by the Southern Ocean. The ocean is still working on the rock, with seven of eight formations still standing. But there's another gem in this park about 275 kilometers west of Melbourne: London Bridge, a natural offshore rock span that partially collapsed in 1990 and became a bridge without a connection. (People standing on the rocks were stranded when the middle collapsed and had to be rescued via helicopter.) It's a good idea to stay on the accessible walking paths and scenic drives along the coast. Spectacular waterfalls around the U.S. Fairy Bridge, China . China has quite a collection of natural bridges, including one that experts say has the longest span of any natural bridge in the world. The Fairy Bridge (Xianren Qiao), in southwestern China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region near the border with Vietnam, has a 400-foot span. Not that the bridge made of limestone karst is easy to measure. Members of the Natural Arch and Bridge Society took a boat to the site in 2010 and used laser equipment to measure the span, calling it the ""longest known natural arch in the world, by a wide margin."" Pravcicka Brana, Czech Republic . Hans Christian Andersen wrote part of ""The Snow Queen"" in Bohemian Switzerland, and several scenes from the Chronicles of Narnia were shot here. It's no wonder: The fairytale landscape of this region, now part of the Czech Republic, is magical. Go see its most well-known symbol: the Pravcicka Brana, a natural bridge standing tall in Bohemian Switzerland National Park, now part of the Czech Republic. While there are many rock formations rising up amid the forests and valleys in the park, Pravcicka Brana is the largest stone bridge on the European continent, with a span of 27 meters (nearly 90 feet) and a height of 21 meters (nearly 70 feet). Wadi Rum, Jordan . Bedouin tribes still live in goat-hair tents in the Wadi Rum Protected Area of southern Jordan, which is 720 square kilometers (about 278 square miles) of mostly desert wilderness. Among the sandstone and granite mountains and valleys are natural bridges rising up to greet you. Although visitors can take private cars or hike on foot to explore the bridges and the region, Bedouin cooperatives offer tours via basic Jeep or pickup trucks. And if you want a real adventure, book a camel ride to explore the area and overnight in a Bedouin camp. Cliffside beaches around the world . Natural Bridge at Yoho National Park, Canada . While many nature loving explorers head to Canada's famous Banff National Park, there are tall peaks, amazing waterfalls and a spectacular natural bridge to be found to the west at Yoho National Park. Located on the western slopes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains in British Columbia, Yoho definitely lives up to its name (a Cree expression of awe and wonder). Travelers can witness Kicking Horse River still carving its path through this natural bridge. Tassili n'Ajjer, Algeria . It's true that southeastern Algeria's Tassili n'Ajjer, named a World Heritage Site in 1982, is better known for more than 15,000 drawings and engravings dating back to 6,000 B.C. The drawings record climate change and human life in the region. But tucked away in this tense region at the edge of the Sahara, near the border with Libya, Mali and Niger, this spot was also recognized as a UNESCO site for its remarkable collection of natural bridges and rock formations dense enough to be called ""rock forests."" The eroding sandstone ""forests of rock"" document the environmental changes, marking major climate change and geological transformation over the millennia. Water and wind have shaped this magical, lunar-like landscape. Natural Bridge, Virginia . Long considered sacred by the Monacans, Virginia's Natural Bridge was one of this English colony's earliest recognized natural wonders. The bridge was created by an underground stream flowing through a cave, whose roof collapsed, according to the arch society. It even had a famous owner: Thomas Jefferson bought the surrounding land and bridge from King George III of England in 1774, before the young republic's founding. A National Historic Landmark, the land in Rockbridge County remained in the hands of private owners for centuries. Now the state of Virginia has announced plans to turn the land into a park by the end of 2015. Cueva de los Portales, Cuba . In the western Cuban province of Pinar del Rio lies the Cueva de los Portales, a cavernous area near the Parque Nacional La Guira. The Río Caiguanabo flows beneath a natural bridge, which is connected to a cave that served as one of revolutionary  leader Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara's hideouts during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. The area is now popular with birdwatchers. Hazarchishma Natural Bridge, Afghanistan . When Wildlife Conservation Society researchers traveled to Afghanistan in 2010 to conduct a wildlife survey in the troubled country, they discovered an enormous natural bridge that may be one of the largest in the world. They returned to Hazarchishma Natural Bridge, in the central highlands of Afghanistan, in 2011 to take measurements. The bridge, which is named after a local village, is more than 60 feet high, has a span of more than 200 feet across its base and rises more than 3,000 meters (nearly 10,000 feet) above sea level. It was created over the millennia by the then-flowing waters of the dry Jawzari Canyon. Lexington Arch, Nevada . Is it a natural bridge? A cornerstone of Great Basin National Park in Nevada, the Lexington Arch may actually be a bridge. There's evidence to suggest that the waters of Lexington Creek flowed through a cave in the canyon wall long ago, expanding the tunnel that's now Lexington Arch. Debate the question as you marvel at one of the few natural arches in the west made of limestone rather than sandstone.","Natural arches around the world are made of rock, with a hole formed by natural forces .

"(CNN)Saying war crimes have been committed on a massive scale in Syria, members of a United Nations commission indicated Friday they may soon publish a list of people suspected of atrocities during the protracted civil war. Four lists have already been compiled but have been kept secret because the alleged perpetrators should be given due process, said Vitit Muntarbhorn, a member of the U.N. commission of inquiry on Syria.  A new list would consolidate the first four, he said. ""We are also considering today, this month and next month, the pros and cons of whether or not to release the list,"" he said. The announcement came as the commission released its ninth report on the situation in Syria, where a civil war has intensified and become more bloody since beginning in 2011. More than 200,000 civilians have been killed during the conflict and millions of people have fled to neighboring countries. Many other people have been tortured or raped. And concern is building because children are now being turned into executioners. In their report, the four commissioners said: ""Missed humanitarian opportunities have been aggravated by the exponential rise in the perpetration of war crimes, crimes against humanity and human rights violations."" The commissioners recommended that justice be administered through the International Criminal Court or an ad hoc international tribunal. To set up a tribunal would take the approval of the U.N. Security Council, said Mark Lyall Grant, the United Kingdom's ambassador to the United Nations. The commission may release the list of alleged war criminals at a meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva on March 17. The list would name members of the Syrian military, rebel groups and ISIS. CNN's Richard Roth contributed to this report.","U.N. commission has compiled four lists with names of suspected war criminals .

"(CNN)A year after a massive coal ash spill into a North Carolina river, Duke Energy said Friday it would pay $102 million in a proposed settlement of nine criminal charges filed against the company by the U.S. government. The charges, all misdemeanors alleging violations of the Clean Water Act, were filed Friday in U.S. district courts in North Carolina. A federal judge would have to approve the settlement. The case concerns problems at several Duke Energy locations, but the major problem occurred at the Dan River Steam Station in Rockingham County, near the Virginia border. On February 2, 2014, a leak in a 48-inch stormwater pipe at that retired plant sent about 39,000 tons of coal ash and wastewater and up to 27 million gallons of basin water pouring into the Dan River. The utility originally said 82,000 tons of coal ash spilled, but later revised the number. Parts of the river turned into gray sludge. Coal ash, the byproduct of burning coal, is made up of aluminum oxide, iron oxide and silicon oxide. It also contains arsenic, mercury and other metals. Researchers from Wake Forest University who used cameras on an unmanned aerial aircraft to create a 3-D image of the spill said as many as 35 million gallons of arsenic-contaminated water and ash may have made its way into the river. A filing of criminal information said Duke ""negligently"" discharged pollutants and that employees failed to ""exercise the degree of care that someone of ordinary prudence would have exercised in the same circumstances with respect to the discharge of ash and coal ash wastewater. ..."" The criminal charges were filed against the company, not individuals. The $102 million in payments would be paid by shareholders, not customers, a company press release said. The company said $68.2 million would go toward fines and restitution and $34 million for community service and mitigation projects. The company said Clean Water Act violations concerning unauthorized discharges occurred at these company facilities in North Carolina: the Dan River plant in Eden; the Riverbend Steam Station in Mount Holly; the H.F. Lee Steam Electric Plant in Goldsboro; and the Asheville Steam Electric Generating Plant. A maintenance issue occurred at the Cape Fear Steam Electric Plant in Moncure, the company said. The agreement would include five years of probation and a court-appointed monitor to make sure Duke Energy complies with all provisions of the settlement, the company said. Duke has apologized for the spills -- both when they happened and Friday. ""We are accountable for what happened at Dan River and have learned from this event,"" said Lynn Good, president and CEO of Duke Energy.","Federal government files criminal charges against Duke Energy over coal ash spill .

"(CNN)Hollywood's leading women want to be treated with a little more respect as they parade the red carpet on Oscar night this Sunday. And it's not hard to sympathize with them. Female nominees, it seems, are tired of simply engaging in the same old small talk about the make of their gowns, the jewels they are wearing, or the footwear they're flaunting (not to mention the intimate secrets of their personal beautification process). So they have been pushing back in the form of #AskHerMore, a campaign launched last year that's being waged by women in Hollywood wanting to broaden the scope of their pre-telecast conversations beyond fashion. Whether it be Cate Blanchett's pointed question to a cameraman at last year's SAG Awards, or contenders refusing to raise their hands for E! Entertainment's ""Mani-Cam,"" actresses are starting to speak out about some of the more sexist treatment they face. So, can we expect a red carpet rebellion at this year's Academy Awards? Far from it. Posing like a supermodel and discussing couture delivers a big payoff -- a lucrative contract representing a luxury brand of cosmetics, watches, automobiles or even bottled water and automobiles. Such contracts give stars an extra income, allowing them to refrain, if they choose, from making B-list movies or popcorn blockbusters. Plus, fronting a glossy campaign can also create a sophisticated aura around the star in question. And this award season has felt even longer than usual. Instead of kicking off with January's Golden Globes, it started two months early, in November 2014, with the Hollywood Film Awards. Purists lampooned the telecast, which despite proclaiming itself the ""Official Launch of the Awards Season"" has seemed barely known to much of the public beyond Hollywood. Yet that didn't stop the talent considered a shoo-in for the big prizes from being out in force at the ceremony, gamely fielding pre-telecast questions from film and fashion reporters. And this week, the Oscar front-runners are still talking fashion, despite the word on the ground here in Los Angeles being that some nominees are nursing colds, while others already have blisters from walking miles of red carpet in their borrowed designer stilettos. For some, it seems, the thinking is #AskHerMore be damned! It didn't used to be like this. Serious actors -- especially those intent on winning an Oscar -- once refrained from the ""grubby"" work of advertising. Cher's decision to promote health clubs in a series of TV commercials, for example, was seen by many as scuttling her shot as best actress for the 1985 film ""Mask."" If an actor did decide to promote a brand, he or she would generally do so on the sly, in Japan, and pocket big money out of sight of Western audiences (much easier in the pre-YouTube era). Today there is no such stigma. Last year's red carpet star Lupita Nyong'o, who secured a statuette for ""12 Years A Slave,"" got an early jump on the Oscar buzz-generating action at the Telluride Film Festival in August before embarking on a six-month stretch of appearances in which she seemed to divide her time between film industry functions (which allow for networking opportunities with Academy voters) and fashion goings-on. On the day her Golden Globe nomination was announced, for example, Nyong'o was attending the Paris couture shows. A month after Nyong'o claimed the best supporting actress Oscar, Lancôme Paris announced she would be one of its brand ambassadors. This is all a far cry from the days when the shoe was on the other foot, and it was old Hollywood's leading women who felt honored to be associated with their stylists. Golden age stars like Marlene Dietrich and Audrey Hepburn were proud of their associations with style gurus like Christian Dior and Hubert de Givenchy -- and they also paid for their clothes -- while Grace Kelly, Sophia Loren, Janet Leigh and Elizabeth Taylor relied on Edith Head, the head of the costume department at Paramount Pictures, to prep them for awards-season premieres and the Oscars. Similarly, on her way to winning the best actress prize for ""Caberet"" in 1973, Liza Minnelli sought out the services of design legend Halston, reportedly to ensure that she would have an image that would keep her out of the shadow of her legendary mother, Judy Garland. Halston's reported advice? Minnelli should purchase a set of Louis Vuitton luggage, which he then filled with clothes, footwear and jewels all made to measure for her. Still, for a time, the demise of the studio system and feminist ideals started to put paid to women prettifying themselves (too much) for awards season. Indeed, a slew of late 1970s and '80s winners sported pantsuits and cocktail attire at the Golden Globes and the Oscars. But Sharon Stone's reasoning that ""If you are going to the Oscars, you might as well go to the Oscars"" may have marked a resurgence of glamor. Onetime model Stone liked fashion and understood how to wear fine jewelry. And today, her successors on the nominations list, actresses like Cate Blanchett, Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore -- respected both for their style and talent -- carry her torch. And increasingly, male leads seem interested in getting in on the act. Eddie Redmayne, up for best actor for ""The Theory of Everything,"" has been a regular presence at events on TV. And although he hasn't been nominated for an Academy Award, Ellar Coltrane of ""Boyhood"" has been working the style angle, becoming a red carpet star and the face of Richard Linklater's coming-of-age epic. And like Nyong'o, whose claim to fame prior to ""12 Years a Slave"" was an MTV Base show, Coltrane has shot to overnight stardom . Clad in sharp Armani tuxedos and plush velvet Isaia suits, he has gamely chatted his way through E! pre-telecasts. So if you tune in on Sunday, don't expect the stars to be camera-shy, even if they are cringing inside at the questions they are being asked. After all, while some of them will be collecting awards for work already completed, the Oscar pre-show is also a chance for many of them to be auditioning for some more work -- whether it's on the silver screen or a magazine cover. And for that reason alone, the red carpet circus isn't going anywhere.","Academy Awards ceremony takes place this Sunday .

"Dropping like flies. Yet another one of the names floated to replace outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has removed themselves from consideration for the role. According to a source familiar with the process, MichÃ¨le Flournoy, former undersecretary of defense for policy, sent a letter Tuesday to the Board of Directors of The Center for a New American Security, a Washington, DC, think tank where she serves as CEO, that ""family concerns"" drove her decision. The same source says that she informed the President of her decision last night. Flournoy is the third big name to remove themselves from the consideration process, after the President announced Hagel's resignation on Monday. On Monday afternoon. a spokesperson for Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, who served in the Army's 82nd Airborne, said he ""loves his job and wants to continue serving the people of Rhode Island in the United States Senate."" Another name that has been floated is Sen. Carl Levin, of Michigan. But an aide to Levin tells CNN that the retiring Armed Services Committee chairman has not been approached by the White House yet and he is not interested in the job. ""He is looking forward to returning home full time,"" Levin's spokeswoman Tara Andringa told CNN. Levin is 80 and has served six terms in the Senate. Other names being floated for the gig include White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and â€‹former Defense Secretary Colin Powell. But a source familiar with the search process tells CNN that neither are being considered. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, on the other hand, could be in the mix, according to the source. A senior administration official said the President still wants to make his pick ""as soon as possible."" ""Days not weeks,"" the official added. The official also said that the President's preference remains that he wants somebody who is steeped in the inner workings of the Pentagon. The development that Flournoy had removed herself from consideration took several officials by surprise.","Michele Flournoy takes herself out of the running for Secretary of Defense .

"Chuck Hagel was doomed even before he walked into the Pentagon. The Vietnam veteran with deep relationships on Capitol Hill shocked Washington by appearing unprepared and inarticulate before his former colleagues during a Senate confirmation hearing to become defense secretary. He never really recovered and, nearly two years later, seemed increasingly out of step with an administration facing new national security challenges everywhere from the Middle East to Ukraine. Hagel announced his intent to resign on Monday. He was pushed out by President Barack Obama, sources told CNN, but will stay in the job until a successor is named. His departure reflects Hagel's inability to adapt to rapidly changing developments around the world or master the politics of Washington. Hagel joined the administration at a time when Obama insisted that the nation was moving beyond a decade of war only to find himself grappling with the threat from ISIS, turmoil in Iraq and aggressive moves from Russia. In fact, there were signs that Hagel was becoming increasingly critical in private of Obama's Syria strategy, which is constrained by the President's insistence that U.S. ground troops must not be dragged into a vicious civil war. ""I have heard he has been a dead man walking for a while. He just didn't prove effective"" said a former Pentagon official familiar with the personal dynamics of the Obama administration's foreign policy team. Some Hagel defenders say he never really had a chance. ""He came into an almost impossible situation,"" said Lawrence Korb, a former senior defense official now with the Center for American Progress. ""He had a confirmation hearing that really weakened him and he inherited a budget that was impacted by a sequester."" Several former officials said Hagel was undermined by an assumption that his Pentagon tenure would happen during a time of peace that would allow him to focus on streamlining the defense budget and ending combat in Afghanistan. ""What you saw instead were rolling problems with Syrian chemical weapons, the rise of ISIS, and troops returning to Iraq,"" said another former administration official. Meanwhile, The New York Times reported over the weekend that Obama authorized a more expansive mission for the military in Afghanistan in 2015. A third former senior administration official said that although Obama genuinely liked Hagel, with whom he toured Iraq and Afghanistan before becoming president, an impression took hold in the White House that the defense Secretary had not mastered his job. ""He was effective (at) dealing with management and budget issues, but not as a public face for policies and not as a forceful presence in internal policy debates,"" the official said. Former Col. Peter Mansoor, a CNN defense analyst, said Hagel was ""a loyal team player whose skill sets as a senator never fully translated into being Secretary of Defense. He added: ""Both sides came to that conclusion."" Obama and Hagel put on a united front at a White House resignation announcement on Monday, with Obama pouring praise on his defense secretary, apparently to neuter speculation about a political split. A Pentagon spokesman insisted that Hagel wasn't fired. ""Both men agree that this is the right course of action,"" Rear Admiral John Kirby told Jake Tapper on CNN's The Lead. ""And the Secretary said it clearly today, he not only supports it but he's the one who initiated the conversation with the President."" But in Obama's orbit, it was accepted a long time ago that the choice of Hagel -- based on his friendship with Obama, criticism of the Iraq war surge and his standing as a former GOP senator -- never clicked. Hagel also appears to have been the latest outsider who struggled to penetrate the national security clique around Obama, which, if anything, has further narrowed during the president's second term. Those closest to the president have embraced a foreign policy philosophy nourished by a belief in ending foreign wars, not starting new ones. National security intimates include adviser Susan Rice, Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes. Last month, it emerged that Hagel wrote a blunt memo to Rice criticizing the administration's approach to Syria as insufficient, warning, ""we need to have a sharper view of what to do about the Assad regime,"" a senior defense official told CNN. He appeared to be tackling the paradoxes of U.S. strategy in Syria, where Washington is fighting to eliminate ISIS, a scenario which could benefit President Bashar Al-Assad, to whom the administration is implacably opposed. Hagel also found himself stuck in the middle of the tussle between the White House and top generals, not just on Syria, but over post war Iraq and Afghanistan, with top brass pushing for a more direct U.S. military role than the White House envisions. In Washington's foreign policy community, there are also whispers that Obama forged a closer professional relationship with Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, than Hagel. His experience contrasts with Secretary of State John Kerry, who is also not a member of the White House's inner circle. But he commandeered initiatives on Russia, the Middle East and Iran. And though Kerry's success has been limited, there aren't any suggests that he's lost the confidence of aides within his department or in the administration. Hagel's appointment was partly intended to build on close relationships he maintained on Capitol Hill after leaving the Senate in 2009. But even those ties failed to help bolster Hagel. Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain repeatedly challenged Hagel in the tense confirmation hearing over whether he still believed his 2007 statement that the Iraq war surge was the ""most dangerous foreign policy blunder"" since the Vietnam War. Before voting against his confirmation, McCain warned ""nothing in Senator Hagel's background indicates that he would effectively manage the Department of Defense."" Opinion: Pushing out Hagel not shake-up Obama needs . Ironically, now that he has quit, some of his prime antagonists have his back. McCain told News Talk 550 radio in Arizona Monday that Hagel was ""up to the job"" but was in his office last week and was ""very frustrated."" He later suggested in a statement that Hagel's departure was because of internal administration disagreements over ISIS strategy. ""I know Chuck was frustrated with aspects of the administration's national security policy and decision making process,"" said McCain. ""His predecessors have spoken about the excessive micro-management they faced from the White House and how that made it more difficult to do their jobs successfully. McCain added: ""Chuck's situation was no different."" South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican, said his confidence in Hagel had grown over the past year. ""To his credit, he was really willing to consider a more robust response (than the president) and he started saying that Syria had become a direct threat to the homeland,"" he said. Hagel had also shown signs of being increasingly out of sync with White House messaging. This summer, he called ISIS an ""imminent threat to every interest we have.""  But the White House insisted there was no sign that ISIS could harm the homeland and that the point of Obama's decision to engage the radical Sunni group was to ensure that it would not pose a danger in the future. Hagel's comments also contrasted with Obama's aside to the New Yorker in January that current militant groups were like a junior varsity team compared to Al-Qaeda - a quote widely seen as referring to ISIS. His departure may be one of several signs that the White House has no intention of changing its approach to national security in Obama's final two years in the White House. In a recent episode, deputy national security advisor Tony Blinken was nominated for the number two job in the State Department, over Wendy Sherman, who sources said Kerry wanted for the job. While there have been whispers around Hagel for months, the sudden nature of Monday's announcement sparked surprise on Capitol Hill, where speculation is already turning to his replacement. Graham said two of the most talked about candidates — Michèle Flournoy, the former Under Secretary of Defense for policy, and Democratic Senator Jack Reed, who served in the Army's 82nd Airborne — would both be ""excellent."" Reed took his name out of consideration on Monday. One former official suggested that Sen. Carl Levin, the retiring head of the Senate Armed Services Committee, would also be a safe pair of hands for Obama's last two years in office. Meanwhile, there are questions about whether the management change at the Pentagon will reshape U.S. policy toward ISIS much as Donald Rumsfeld's departure as defense secretary at a similar point during George W. Bush's second term, opened the way for the Iraq surge. ""Is this new pick going to double down on an insufficient response and a flawed strategy?"" Graham said in a telephone interview, ""or will this new pick signal a willingness by Obama to accept a more robust response?"" ""It's an opportunity surrounded by danger,"" Graham said.

"The White House has a big problem on its hands: finding someone to replace Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who was pushed out of the administration this week. Since Michele Flournoy withdrew her name from consideration on Tuesday, there is a growing sense that many potential candidates may be shying away from the job due to the short time frame they would be in office and concerns over how independently they can function from the National Security Council, according to both current and former senior administration and congressional officials. Flournoy cited family reasons for her decision to withdraw her name, but several administration officials say the decision came as a surprise because she had known she was on the short list of candidates being vetted. Another name now being widely circulated is former Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carterâ€”who is widely credited with reforming cumbersome and expensive weapons acquisition procedures and programs, but who had clashed in the past with White House staff as well. The scramble to find a new defense secretary comes as new details emerge over Hagel's departure from the administration. Hagel submitted his letter of resignation on Monday after it became apparent over a series of meetings with President Barack Obama that the president no longer wanted him in the job. ""Hagel didn't wait to be asked to leave,"" a senior administration official close to Hagel tells CNN. Obama and Hagel had three conversations since late October, the last one being on Nov. 18. ""If you have three conversations with the President, you know where things stand"", the official said. After the final conversation, Hagel has a personal sense of ""inevitability"" he would resign, rather than wait to be fired, the official said, describing to CNN in detail the secretary's actions and thinking. The official said Hagel rapidly came to the conclusion after that final meeting he ""would not put up a fight,"" to keep his job, but would instead resign ""giving the President options"" to chart a different course. Hagel views his decision somewhat in military terms, when an officer submits his resignation knowing he will otherwise be fired. The official said Hagel is ""at peace"" with his resignation and believes it was the honorable thing to do. ""He knew he wasn't wanted,"" the official said. Hagel has been criticized for being a secretary who implements White House policy rather than being a dynamic member of a tight inner Obama circle offering new ideas and options. But this official strongly disputed portions of that characterization, saying ""even John Kerry isn't a member of that circle,"" referring to the secretary of state. While Hagel may not have regularly spoken up in large meetings, he did seek to be involved the official says. In September, he wrote a memo for Obama and the NSC to ""make the case"" that the administration needed to look for more ""creative and active ways to deter Vladimir Putin,"" the official said. Behind the scenes, Hagel had grown deeply frustrated by the decision making process at the NSC, which is universally described as ""micromanagement."" Hagel joins former defense secretaries Leon Panetta and Robert Gates, who have also detailed NSC interference in both of their books and recent public appearances. Hagel was also frustrated on several key issues where he had indeed offered specific views. He had wanted more immediate action on sending non lethal military aid to Ukraine, and also had written a memo calling for a clearer approach to US military and diplomatic action in Syria. The Pentagon was aware both memos had been poorly received at the National Security Council. The official insisted that Hagel is fully supportive of the President's policy of not putting troops on the ground in Iraq in combat roles. If Obama pushed Hagel out because he is looking for a course correction on the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, it has not gotten to the point where Hagel or the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Martin Dempsey, have been asked for any new options. OPINION: Pushing out Hagel not shake-up Obama needs . It now appears likely a confirmation hearing for Hagel's successor might not be scheduled before February, leaving a new Pentagon chief with less than two years on the job. Several administration officials tell CNN the White House is also well aware any confirmation hearing could be a bruising fight given that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz) is taking over the Armed Services Committee and is a deep odds with the White House over Syria and Iraq. That all adds up to a relatively short term in office likely that will almost certainly be characterized by fights with a Republican Congress on everything from the war against ISIS to potential mandatory spending cuts.","Chuck Hagel resigned this week .

"Irbil, Iraq (CNN)New U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Saturday that success is more important than timing in any attempt to retake Iraq's second most populous city, Mosul, from ISIS militants. Carter spoke on his way to Afghanistan, where he is meeting Afghan leaders and U.S. troops in his first week in the post, having taken over from Chuck Hagel. Any operation to take Mosul will be ""Iraqi-led and U.S.-supported,"" he said. ""It's important that it be launched at a time when it can succeed and so I think the important thing is that it get done when it can be done successfully. Even if I knew exactly when that was going to be, I wouldn't tell you,"" he said. ""Of course, I'm open. I'm always open to advice from our military commanders about what the best way to achieve success is. ""And that is a question that will come down the road but I think what's important is that the campaign to retake Mosul succeed and we're committed to that success and not to a particular timetable."" Months after most Iraqi troops dropped their weapons and ran for their lives in Mosul, up to 25,000 are expected to head back there in April or May to try to retake the city, according to a U.S. official. And Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told the BBC this week that while there's still work to do, he is sure the Iraqis are going to retake the crucial northern city. ""We are now planning an offensive on Mosul in the coming few months,"" the Prime Minister said. ""We have to prepare for it carefully because the only choice we have in Mosul (is to win). We have to win in Mosul to keep (ISIS) out."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, speaking in London, said the international community was increasingly determined to act together against ISIS and that progress would continue to be made. ""We have the tools, we have the political will, we have the determination and we are making gains in Iraq. Territory is increasingly beginning to come back into the hands of the Iraqi government. The Iraqi military is now beginning to stand up with greater capacity,"" he said. Despite Kerry's vote of confidence, some doubt whether victory in Mosul is possible. Mosul has been a symbol of Iraqi military incompetence, given how troops and police ran from their posts as ISIS militants arrived in June. Since then, there has been the start of airstrikes by the United States and international allies against ISIS. The Iraqi military has also had fresh training, some of it conducted by U.S. and allied forces, to make it more effective. It has had some success in curbing the ISIS onslaught, but not in taking back a lot of territory -- much less that as valued as Mosul. New footage released by ISIS on Friday gave another insight into the challenge facing the Iraqi army and its allies. The video, apparently of an attack early this month on an Iraqi military outpost near Samarra, 100 miles north of Baghdad, showed dozens of seized American-made M16 assault rifles and piles of AK-47s, as well as armored personnel carriers and a Humvee. All these are now in the hands of ISIS militants who appear to have overrun the outpost, some 60 miles northwest of Baghdad. The video also showed several dead Iraqi soldiers, with one of the bodies burning. U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said it had no confirmation of when and where the vehicles were seized or where the video was actually shot. Although this latest incident was only small, ISIS forces have steadily acquired large quantities of U.S. weaponry as a result of seizing Iraqi army equipment provided by the United States, particularly in Mosul. Up until now, one of the biggest and most successful forces has been the Kurdish Peshmerga that serve Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish government, often at odds with Baghdad. On Saturday, Kurdish fighters repelled a massive offensive by ISIS in the town of Gwer and gained full control of the area, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) Foreign Relations Office told CNN. At least 34 ISIS militants were killed during the fighting. These Kurdish fighters will have a role, including around Mosul. In his BBC interview, al-Abadi said that liaisons between Iraqi forces and the Peshmerga ""must be powerful and must be watertight"" to defeat ISIS. According to the CENTCOM official, who spoke to reporters Thursday, Mosul police and tribal forces would likely join Iraqi troops in the assault on the city. Peshmerga would play a supporting role, not going into Mosul but instead blocking off supply and escape routes north and west of the city. The hope is for an operation in April or May to avoid running into Ramadan (mid-June through mid-July) and Iraq's summer heat, the CENTCOM official said. A final decision has not yet been made, though. Count Sirwan Barzani, a senior Peshmerga commander, is among the skeptics that such a spring assault would work. ""I don't think it's realistic, and I don't have any idea about a plan,"" Barzani told CNN's Ben Wedeman. ""And if it involves the Iraqi army only, it's not going to work. The Iraqi army is not ready for the fight."" Retired Maj. Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks told CNN he believed it had been a mistake to reveal the potential timing of the Mosul operation and that it could put U.S. forces at risk. ""This is a terribly unfortunate lack of professionalism, in almost a relaxed approach towards a challenge that we have been trying to get our arms around for almost a year,"" he said. If the Iraqi forces -- from five army brigades -- do the street-to-street fighting, theoretically they should significantly outnumber their ISIS counterparts. Right now, ISIS has an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 fighters in Mosul, the U.S. official said, but more could join the fight if they take the threat of attack seriously. However, an additional challenge for the Shia-dominated Iraqi military and Peshmerga is that they will be trying to take a majority Arab Sunni population city. Even if the offensive succeeds, sectarian divisions could exacerbate an already complicated situation and make it hard for the Iraqi military to hold on to the city. The approximate time of the attack had previously been reported: A CENTCOM official told CNN earlier this year that Iraqi forces could make their first move in April. CNN's Ben Wedeman reported from Irbil and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Barbara Starr and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says Iraqi military is making gains against ISIS .

"Just two weeks ago, Yasir was regularly strapped into an explosive vest and handed a pistol, an AK-47 and a radio to stand guard at an ISIS base in the eastern Syrian city of Deir Ezzor. Yasir -- not his real name -- is just 15 and an ISIS child soldier. When we first met, he was clearly nervous, his hands slightly quivering as he picked up his cup of tea. Understandable, given all he has been through and the twisted mental maze he is trying to navigate. Yasir had followed his father to be with the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front. When ISIS took over their area, father and son swore allegiance to ISIS. ""I spent a month without seeing my family or anyone that I knew,"" Yasir recalls. ""It was forbidden to see or speak to anyone."" He says there were about 100 children and for a month they were kept isolated from all that they knew and loved, and not allowed even to see or speak to their families. Rather, they were entrenched in intense religious indoctrination. There were daily lessons on the violent and radical version of Islam practiced by ISIS. Rigorous military training was also a daily feature of their lives. He says: ""We used to crawl under webbing. There was fire above it, and we would be firing our weapons. We would jump through large metal rings and the trainers would be firing at our feet and telling us if we stop we will be shot."" He says the trainers would have them run for 2 kilometers. ""I was very careful not to stop running, I didn't stop, even if I was exhausted, out of breath, I didn't stop."" ISIS posts videos and pictures on the Internet bragging about its so-called ""cubs of the Islamic State."" While there are no firm numbers on how many children are part of ISIS, the United Nations says there are confirmed reports of children as young as 12 undergoing military training. Yasir admits he missed his parents. It was the first time he had stayed away from them, but he says he and the other boys would laugh, joke and talk about their training. After a month he was sent home and began to regularly report for duty. ""When we arrived they gave us guns and the explosive belt and the radio,"" he says. ""We would get calls from the checkpoints alerting us [when] the ISIS VIPs were coming. Anyone who wasn't a VIP, we would pick up our guns and stop them."" But his mother would beg him to leave. Yasir says: ""She would say that I am too young. 'Please leave, you have nothing to do with this.' I would tell her that this is the jihad that we all must do."" He says the first time he saw a beheading he didn't eat for two days, repulsed by the scene but not the actual act. He admits he was afraid the explosive belt he wore would accidentally detonate if he was hit by shrapnel. He also felt proud, strong and filled with a sense of purpose. But his father realized he had to save his son and himself. He decided to defect and tricked Yasir into leaving with him for Turkey. Yasir says: ""I was asking him 'why are you doing this? What happened?' My father turned to me and said they are not on the right religious track."" The Yasir we met appears to have a gentle demeanor, but he's clearly confused, struggling to define what is right and wrong, and wrest himself from the psychological damage ISIS has done. He initially says he wants to go back to ISIS because his friends are there, and he defends some of the strict interpretations of Islam, but he also says: ""I am discovering over time they have no religion."" Toward the end of our interview, he tells us he regrets having joined them. Yasir has a chance to emerge from the hold of ISIS, to return to the Arabic and math-loving schoolboy he was before the war. But that is not the case for the other children firmly in the grasp of ISIS, living under their rule, easily manipulated and lured toward the terrorist organization.","Yasir, 15, trained with ISIS in Syria .

"So far, it least, it looks like a coalition of the not-so-willing to help President Barack Obama combat ISIS. Public statements of support from key allies have yet to be matched by concrete commitments to the proposed coalition, particularly for expanded military strikes against the Sunni jihadists rampaging through northern Iraq from Syria. Secretary of State John Kerry's swing through the Middle East this week garnered broad pledges of backing, but few specifics made public. In Turkey on Friday, Kerry met with top leaders and told reporters of positive meetings, but he announced no details regarding possible contributions from one of Syria's neighbors. Kerry: More than 40 countries offered assistance . ""It's just not appropriate to start laying out, as we are in the process of talking to all these countries, which country is doing what,"" he told reporters. ""Next week, I'll be testifying before Congress and we'll have more of the reports back in as others are talking to various countries and we'll have a better sense of where we stand on that."" He added: ""I will tell you this: More than 40 countries had already offered assistance of one kind or another before I left Washington."" Earlier this week, Sunni Gulf states needed by Obama to legitimize regional support for going after ISIS put a qualifier on military contributions, saying they would participate ""as appropriate."" Meanwhile, NATO partners Britain and Germany have sent mixed signals on participating in airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria, while France ruled it out but committed to military support in Iraq. Difficulty getting a coalition . ""There is likely to be a lot of difficulty getting a coalition beyond a limited approach, especially regarding U.S. efforts to attack ISIS in Syria,"" said Faysal Itani, a fellow at the Atlantic Council's Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East. Different countries have different reasons to be wary of getting fully involved in the U.S.-led coalition. For example, Turkey has internal political considerations, as well as 49 Turkish diplomats taken hostage by ISIS, Itani noted. U.S. officials say Turkey has taken steps to cut the flow of money to ISIS and denied entry to or deported several thousand foreign fighters heading to Syria to join the extremists. Now they look for Turkey to stop oil exports from ISIS-held areas that bring more funding to the group. While Iraq's new government will fully join the U.S.-led strategy announced this week by Obama, major regional players including Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia were unlikely to be as supportive, Itani said. ""Quiet cooperation"" Even staunch U.S. ally Jordan, a certain backer, would likely choose what Itani called ""quiet cooperation."" ""They're not going to come out all guns blazing and engage jihadists,"" he said. Obama's strategy represents a potential milestone in the growing regional conflict, which involves Syria's civil war, Iraq's continuing instability and the emergence of the extremists known as ISIS, ISIL and Islamic State into a potent and growing terrorist force that controls an area larger than the United Kingdom. In his nationally televised speech Wednesday to present the strategy, Obama called  for airstrikes on ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria to ""hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are."" He also announced more military aid and other support for Iraqi forces and Syrian opposition groups fighting ISIS extremists on the ground, as well as increased counterterrorism efforts to cut off the group's funding and the flow of foreign fighters from Europe and elsewhere joining its ranks. The goal, he said, was to ""dismantle and ultimately destroy"" ISIS. Itani, however, called the ultimate objective unattainable and said that reality made regional nations cautious about joining the coalition effort. Degrade realistic; destroy ""not going to happen"" ""Degrade might be realistic. Destroy is not going to happen,"" he said, noting that wiping out ISIS would require a ground campaign. He also called unrealistic any expectation that Sunni nations in the region would send combat troops to take on ISIS, saying, ""I'm sure it would make the administration's life easier, but it's not going to happen."" ""This whole thing has been covered by deep suspicions and doubts about whether the United States is truly committed to destroying this group,"" Itani said. Obama has ruled out U.S. troops on the ground in Iraq and by extension Syria, leaving it Iraqi forces as well as Syrian opposition groups that are fighting both the government of President Bashar al-Assad and ISIS. ""Ultimately, the responsibility for taking the fight to ISIL on the ground in Syria can and should be Syrian fighters,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Friday. ""And the question is what kind of support can we offer them.  And it's the President's view that the international community can provide support to them in two ways. One is ramping up our training and equipping mission. And two is the deployment of American and allied airstrikes in support of their efforts on the ground."" So far, though, no allies have signed on to joining U.S. airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria. France ruled it out completely, pledging military aid to Iraqi forces include Kurdish fighters in the north, while officials in Britain and Germany gave conflicting responses that signaled internal debate influenced by domestic politics.","Secretary Kerry meets with Middle East allies on anti-ISIS efforts .

"(CNN)The little boy looks barely old enough to walk, let alone understand the dark world he's now inhabiting. He should be toddling around a playground with his friends. But instead, he wears a black balaclava, crouched down in a desolate street with his tiny hands clenched around an AK-47. He pulls the trigger and the recoil of the shot knocks him back, his limbs unable to control the rifle. An adult takes the weapon from the boy's hands as he stands up and steps away, casting a blank glance into the camera. It's just one of the many videos that ISIS -- the Sunni terror group that has declared an independent Islamic state stretching from northern Syria to central Iraq -- has produced to boast of its youngest ""recruits."" And as the radical Islamist group strengthens its hold on this huge swath of land in the heart of the Middle East, it is cramming its warped ideas into minds that are often too young to understand. Mohammed, whose name has been changed out of fears for his safety, was one of them. He has now fled to safety in Turkey, but was just 13 when ISIS said he should attend one of their children's camps in northern Syria. ""My friends and I were studying at the mosque, and they taught us that we should enrol in jihad with the [Islamic State],"" Mohammed told CNN. ""I wanted to go, but my father did not allow me to."" When ISIS found out that Mohammed's father had prevented him from attending, the militants sent a patrol to their house. ""[They told me] 'if you prevent Mohammed from coming to the camp, we will cut off your head,'"" his father, who declined to be named for this story, told CNN. So off Mohammed went to the camp. ""For 30 days we woke up and jogged, had breakfast, then learned the Quran and the Hadith of the Prophet,"" Mohammed says. ""Then we took courses on weapons, Kalashnikovs and other light military stuff."" Some of the militants at the camp were kind, joking and laughing with the younger recruits. Others made the boys watch hideous things. ""They used to bring young [kids] to the camp to lash them,"" Mohammed says. ""When we go to the mosque, they order us to come the next day at a specific time and place to [watch] heads cut off, lashings or stonings."" ""We saw a young man who did not fast for Ramadan, so they crucified him for three days, and we saw a woman being stoned [to death] because she committed adultery."" Mohammed says he understood some of the lessons taught at the camp -- like the importance of prayer and fasting -- but didn't understand words like ""infidels,"" and why he should fight them. The boys would take oaths of allegiance to ISIS' leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and were considered ready to fight once they completed the religious and military courses taught at the camp. Mohammed's father, terrified for his son, tried to visit him several times, but was turned back by guards who told him that the boy wasn't there, or on patrol somewhere else. ""He is only a child, they might make him a suicide bomber and [convince him] that will be in paradise and stuff like that,"" he said. Despite his fears, Mohammed's father expressed doubt that the militants' lessons would truly stick in his son's mind. ""How can a child like that be convinced? Where is the conviction in that? He is a child, it's not possible,"" he said. ""He just saw his friends and kids his age went to the camp, so he wanted to go with them for entertainment. They thought war and guns were entertainment."" Mohammed's father was eventually able to pull him out of the camp, and the family fled to Turkey. Now Mohammed doesn't know what to do. He doesn't want to go back to school -- he thinks he's too old for that now -- and thinks he might like to learn the trade his father practiced before they were forced to flee their home, fearful of what ISIS militants would make him do. Mohammed says one of his friends at the camp has been killed on the front lines of ISIS' war with more moderate rebel groups fighting to topple the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. ""He was martyred in Deir Ezzor when he fought the Free Syrian Army with ISIS,"" Mohammed says. ""He was my age, 13 or 14 years old."" ISIS may preach absolute fealty to Islam, but Mohammed doesn't recognize the militants' message in his own understanding of his religion. ""I love my religion because I am a Muslim,"" he said. ""And I used to go with my father for the prayers before ISIS came. But my father has taught me that religion is not about fighting, but it is about love and forgiveness."" Mohammed and his family are safe now. But as ISIS spreads its tentacles across the region, an increasing number of Syrians have nowhere to hide -- and the group's murderous drive to convert everyone they encounter knows no age limits.

"On May 23, President Barack Obama gave a major speech at the National Defense University in Washington stating his intention to recalibrate his counterterrorism strategy, which is now largely defined by a covert CIA drone program that has come under increased public and congressional scrutiny over the past couple of years. The speech did little to illuminate details of the CIA drone program of the future, and the President was careful to emphasize that the United States would continue to reserve the right to use force ""against terrorists who pose a continuing and imminent threat to the American people."" But the overarching theme of Obama's remarks was one of increasing restraint in U.S. national security policy. Obama also said: ""Before any strike is taken, there must be near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured -- the highest standard we can set."" So has anything changed in the past five months? A study of drone strike activity since May 23, tabulated by the New America Foundation from news reports, provides some answers. The Obama administration has cut the number of CIA drone strikes considerably in Pakistan and has slightly slowed the number of strikes in Yemen. At the same time, the targets of the drone strikes have increasingly tended to be the leaders of al Qaeda or affiliated groups rather than mere foot soldiers.  Nevertheless, the drone program continues to involve a number of civilian casualties and not enough has been done to make it as transparent and legally sustainable as the President has promised. There were just 10 drone strikes in Pakistan during the past five months; an average of one strike every 15 days. In the year before Obama's speech, drone strikes happened every eight days. The average death toll of the most recent strikes in Pakistan is about six, which is about the same as the average death toll over the year before Obama's May speech, indicating that changes to the program have not included restricting the sizes of those groups of suspected militants that are being targeted. According to media reports, four top militant leaders were killed in strikes in Pakistan and Yemen since the May speech, which is a much higher rate of ""high-value"" targeting than was seen previously. Just seven militant leaders were reported killed in the 44 strikes that took place during the year before Obama's keynote speech on terrorism. The pace of drone strikes fell in Yemen after Obama's speech, too, but not as sharply as it did in Pakistan. Since May 23, there have been 12 strikes in Yemen; an average of about one strike every 13 days. Over the previous year, a strike occurred about once every 10 days. As in Pakistan, the size of the groups targeted in Yemen has remained about the same after Obama's speech. The average death toll resulting from those 12 strikes was 4.5, while the average death toll over the year prior was about six. Starting in 2009, the civilian casualty rate from drone strikes has been on a markedly downward trajectory in Pakistan. That trend has continued into 2013, during which no civilians have been confirmed killed in Pakistan, according to the New America Foundation study. Similarly, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a London-based organization that tracks drone strikes, also found no civilian casualties in Pakistan so far this year. But a 10-year-old boy was killed in a drone strike in the Yemeni province of Al Jawf on June 9, and two civilians were reported killed in Yemen on August 8. Reports on CIA drones released Tuesday by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch highlight some of the civilian casualties that have been caused by drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen over the past several years. The Amnesty International report recounts a strike in October 2012, in which a 68-year-old woman, Mamana Bibi, was killed by a drone as she picked vegetables with her grandchildren, a number of whom were injured in the attack. The report observed ""Amnesty International is seriously concerned that these and other strikes have resulted in unlawful killings that may constitute extrajudicial executions or war crimes."" But even these on-the-ground investigations cannot bring to light the full extent or impact of the U.S. drone campaign. Only greater transparency on the part of the government can do that. As U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis observed a century ago, ""Sunlight is the best disinfectant."" How to proceed then? Perhaps the most practical idea to make the drone program as accountable as possible is to set up a U.S. government body that is independent of the CIA and the Pentagon and that would conduct an after-action review of drone strikes to ensure that the victims of the strikes were not civilians and did indeed pose some kind of threat to the United States. It is human nature that if you know someone is grading your homework, you are likely to be more careful about how you perform. The creation of such an independent body would also allow the payment of compensation to any civilian victims of CIA drone strikes, a system that already exists in the U.S. military, which has a mechanism in place to compensate the civilian victims of its drone strikes in conventional war zones such as Afghanistan. Such a move would ensure that the families of injured children -- such as those identified in the Amnesty International report released on Tuesday -- could afford medical care without having to sell their land or other property. And more broadly, it's a fact that international law often lags behind advances in the conduct of warfare. It took, for instance, until 1925 to ban the use of chemical weapons, despite their widespread use a decade earlier. Similarly, the law today has hardly kept up with what drones allow the U.S. to do, such as assassinate individuals a world away by remote control. One could imagine some future Geneva Convention-like protocol that would govern the world's use of drones. On the left, such a development might be unpopular, as it would seem to codify the use of drones and the rights of states to attack terrorist groups outside of their borders. On the right, this could also be controversial, as it might seem to constrain American power. However, the fact is that the U.S. government needs to do some hard thinking about this issue as the monopoly that the United States, Britain and Israel have had on armed drones has evaporated. Early this year, the China disclosed that it had planned to assassinate a notorious drug lord hiding in a remote mountainous part of Southeast Asia with an armed drone but opted to capture him instead. Just as the U.S. government justifies its CIA drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen with the argument that it is at war with terrorists such as al Qaeda and its affiliates, one could imagine that China might strike Chinese Uighur separatists in exile in Afghanistan with drones under the same rubric, or that Iran -- which claims to have armed drones -- might attack Iranian Baluchi nationalists along its border with Pakistan. The United States, which has long been the guarantor of international order, should make its drone program as transparent and accountable as feasible and also start doing the hard work of creating some kind of international consensus about the future use of armed drones.","President Obama spoke six months ago of changes to the U.S. drone war programs .

"(CNN)The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has crude, stomach-turning tactics when it comes to dealing with its enemy, but experts say that its moneymaking methods are highly sophisticated, especially for such a new terror group. Here's a look at how ISIS has made (and taken) millions: . ISIS makes between $1 million and $2 million each day from oil sales, numerous sources tell CNN. The oil comes mostly from refineries and wells that ISIS controls in northern Iraq and northern Syria. The militants smuggle oil into southern Turkey, for example, and sell it to people who desperately need it just to carry on some semblance of everyday life. The United States-led coalition fighting ISIS has repeatedly targeted ISIS oil assets in an effort to, in part, damage this arm of the group's financial system. ISIS is estimated to produce about 44,000 barrels a day in Syria and 4,000 barrels a day in Iraq, according to Foreign Policy. A Kurdish newspaper has published the names of people involved with ISIS and its oil enterprise, the magazine reported. Some on the list were associated with oil smuggling under former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, Foreign Policy said,  as were those associated with a Toyota branch in Irbil that sells ISIS trucks. Through its oil operations, ISIS appears to be trying to establish a self-sufficient state in the ""Sunni triangle"" in west and north Iraq, said Luay al-Khatteeb, founder and director of the Iraq Energy Institute. Today, ISIS controls approximately 6 million people in Iraq and Syria, he said, and ""that is a lot of people who need fuel."" In 2012, the U.S. Treasury Department estimated that al Qaeda and its affiliates had accumulated  $120 million from ransoms over the previous eight years. ISIS was once aligned with al Qaeda. The two groups are thought to operate separately but share similarities. A 2014 New York Times investigation found that since 2008, al Qaeda and its affiliates had received $125 million from ransoms, including $66 million in 2013. A Swedish company reportedly paid $70,000 to save an employee whom ISIS abducted. Though officials publicly deny paying ransoms, the French purportedly have a policy of negotiating with militant groups to free its citizens. ISIS kidnapped Nicolas Henin, Pierre Torres, Edouard Elias and Didier François, in 2013 in Syria. They were released in April 2014, CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen said in a report that asked whether paying ransoms is a wise strategy. The United States has a policy of not doing that, and the recent executions of U.S. and other Western ISIS hostages have sparked debate over whether that should change. ISIS demanded hundreds of millions of dollars for American journalist James Foley, said Philip Balboni, the CEO of GlobalPost, the outlet for which Foley freelanced. ISIS beheaded Foley and released a video of the slaying. The terrorists also told the Japanese government to pay a $200 million ransom to free two Japanese citizens. Japan did not negotiate, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said. ISIS slaughtered the men. ISIS allows locals to dig at ancient sites as long as those people give ISIS a percentage of the monetary value of anything found, according to a September 2014 New York Times opinion piece written by three people who had recently returned from southern Turkey and interviewed people who live and work in ISIS-controlled territory. ISIS' system of profiteering from antiquities thieving is very complicated, the three said, adding that for some areas along the Euphrates River, ISIS leaders encourage semiprofessional field crews to dig. ""ISIS has caused irreparable damage to Syria's cultural heritage,"" the writers said, and it's crucial that the digging and smuggling of antiquities be stopped because Syria's history is essentially part of its identity. Leaving some of the targeted heritage intact, they said, ""will be critical in helping the people of Syria reconnect with the symbols that unite them across religious and political lines."" CNN has extensively reported on ISIS' destruction of some ancient and deeply meaningful sites in Iraq. Officials in Iraq have said ISIS has blown up shrines such as the tomb of Jonah. Qais Hussain Rashid, director general of Iraqi museums, told CNN that ISIS militants ""cut these reliefs and sell them to criminals and antique dealers."" He gestured to an  ornate carving that's thousands of years old. ""Usually they cut off the head, leaving the legs, because the head is the valuable part."" As if pillaging weren't enough, ISIS simply damages fragile historical sites as if they were empty storefronts for the taking. Rashid said that ISIS has used the ancient ruined city of Hatra, or al-Hadr in Arabic, which dates back to the third century B.C., as a training ground, weapons depot and a place to murder prisoners. In 2014, ISIS gained control of large swaths of Iraq and Syria and set out to create civil and administrative entities as if it were a legitimate state. That is, after all, what the militants have claimed to be after -- a caliphate, or an Islamic state led by one person, a successor to the Prophet Mohammed. States demand taxes. In ISIS-controlled areas, to get anything done -- or to survive -- the people pay a fee to the terror group. Businesses are taxed if they want to have essential things like electricity and security, experts say. Drivers who want to move through a checkpoint must hand over cash. When it's used more and more, extortion can seem to a terrified and traumatized populace as a normal tax system, Joseph Thorndike, the director of Tax Analysts' Tax History Project, wrote in Forbes. Sometimes there's no pretense such as ""taxing."" ISIS has stolen money, too. In June 2014, the group raided several banks in Mosul and stole an estimated $500 million, though the full amount is unconfirmed, according to global intelligence firm Stratfor. In Syria, ISIS has seized control of oil facilities, taking over from rebel group al-Nusra, which didn't fight back. The Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations caused a sensation this week when he said that bodies have been found mutilated, and openings have been carved out of the backs of the corpses. To Mohamed Alhakim, that indicated ""some parts are missing."" He said it's possible that ISIS is harvesting and trafficking the organs of dead civilians. There is tremendous skepticism about that, particularly considering how hard it would be to preserve organs in crude and unsanitary war environments. Mark Lyall Grant, Britain's ambassador to the U.N., said there was no proof or evidence to support Alhakim's assertion. Mouaz Moustafa, the executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force in Washington, told CNN that Raqqa, ISIS' de facto Syrian capital, is a kind of breadbasket. ""They've got the cotton and the wheat."" he said. The United States has targeted grain silos that ISIS controls. Last year, ISIS announced that its ""Treasury Department"" would start minting its own gold, silver and copper coins for its ""Official Islamic State Financial System."" It's not clear if this has any value. The move is ""purely dedicated to God,"" ISIS declared, and will remove Muslims from the ""global economic system that is based on satanic usury.""

"The U.S.-led coalition intensified its airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq -- but that may not be enough to stop the terror group's bloody march. ISIS is closing in on the key Syrian Kurdish city of Kobani near the Turkish border, a civilian inside the city told CNN. The terror group is 3 kilometers (nearly 2 miles) east of Kobani, the civilian said on the condition of anonymity, basically confirming a report from the London-based monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. If ISIS takes Kobani, it would control a complete swath of land from its self-declared capital of Raqqa to the Turkish border, more than 100 kilometers (more than 60 miles) away. Residents of Kobani said they felt helpless, and terrified. Despite airstrikes in the area, witnesses said the attacks are too few and too far back from the front lines to slow the momentum of the terror group. ""We need help. We need weapons. We need more effective airstrikes,"" Kobani official Idriss Nassan said. ""If the situation stays like this, we will see a massacre. I can't imagine what will happen if ISIS gets inside Kobani."" The Observatory, whose information comes from a well-established network of activists, doctors and civilians across parts of Syria, said Monday that ISIS fighters were about 5 kilometers to the east and southeast of Kobani, also known as Ayn al Arab. ""My question is: why don't you attack ISIS near Kobani,"" said Rami Abdulrahman, founder and director of the Observatory. US claims successes . The U.S. military believes the ongoing bombing campaign in Syria has degraded ISIS command and control capabilities, according to a briefing to reporters by Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Harrigian, assistant deputy chief of staff for the Air Force. There is evidence that ISiS is unable to amass troops, he said. The Air Force reports that its F-22s are achieving good results not just by dropping bombs, but by keeping an eye out for anything being fired from the ground. About three-fourths of the airstrikes in Iraq have been carried out by the U.S. Air Force, which is also responsible for about half of the strikes in Syria. The latest attacks . So far, the United States and allies have conducted at least 229 airstrikes in Iraq and 59 airstrikes in Syria. Over the weekend, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates joined the United States in pummeling ISIS targets in Syria, U.S. Central Command said. Those attacks took out armed vehicles and also hit four ISIS-controlled modular refineries and an ISIS command-and-control node north of the stronghold of Raqqa, the U.S. military said. On Sunday night, U.S. military forces targeted to an ISIL-held grain storage facility near Manbij,  U.S. Central Command said.   The facility was being used by ISIL as a logistics hub and vehicle staging facility, it said. Adbulrahman of the Syrian Observatory said the strikes in Manbij killed at least two workers at the grain silos. ""We are aware of media reports alleging civilian casualties, but have no evidence to corroborate these claims,"" said Col. Patrick S. Ryder, Director, Public Affairs at the U.S. Central Command. ""I can assure you that before any mission, every precaution is taken to ensure we do not harm civilians or civilian facilities. However, we take all such reports seriously and will look into them further."" Separately a second US official confirms they are looking into a small number of civilian casualties at one targeted site. On the Iraq side of the border, fighter jets and drones conducted at least four airstrikes over the weekend: one near Baghdad that destroyed an ISIS safe house and three near Falluja that destroyed two ISIS checkpoints and a transport vehicle, the U.S. military said. Syrian Deputy Prime Minister at U.N. Meanwhile Syria is lashing out at what it calls U.S. double standards. The Syrian Deputy Prime Minister spoke before the United Nations General Assembly Monday, and said supporting the so-called moderate Syrians with money, weapons and training would only make the situation worse. ""This is a real recipe for the increase of violence and terrorism, and the bloodshed -- and Syrian bloodshed and prolonging the Syrian crisis and demolishing the political solution,"" Al-Walid Al-Moualem said. ""This behavior creates a fertile ground for the growth of those terrorist groups that commit the most heinous crimes on Syrian territories, which requires all of us to seriously and effectively address and eradicate this terrorism, in order to re-establish security and stability in Syria and the region."" Al-Moualem urged the international community to pool efforts to combat terrorism. Obama: We underestimated ISIS . In an interview that aired Sunday on CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" President Barack Obama said the U.S. government ""underestimated what had been taking place in Syria"" during its civil war -- allowing the country to become ""ground zero for jihadists around the world."" ""Over the past couple of years, during the chaos of the Syrian civil war, where essentially you have huge swaths of the country that are completely ungoverned, they were able to reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos,"" Obama said. Another shortcoming was overestimating Iraq's security forces, which were quickly overrun by ISIS when it took over Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul, Obama said. In recent weeks, Obama has been trying to boost an international coalition to fight ISIS in both Syria and Iraq. Despite the U.S. initially overestimating Iraq's military, ""This is America leading the international community to assist a country with whom we have a security partnership with, to make sure that they are able to take care of their business,"" Obama told ""60 Minutes."" ""If we do our job right and the Iraqis fight, then over time our role can slow down and taper off."" ISIS militant: Airstrikes don't really hurt us . In an exclusive interview with CNN, Syrian ISIS fighter Abu Talha said the militant group had prepared for the U.S.-led airstrikes. ""We've been ready for this for some time,"" Abu Talha said. ""We know that our bases are known because they're tracking us with radars and satellites, so we had backup locations."" One man who recently defected from ISIS said part of the group's strategy was to hide its resources in civilian areas. ""They almost entirely emptied out the headquarters,"" the defector, Abu Omar, told CNN's Arwa Damon after he fled to Turkey. ""Some equipment they hid in civilian neighborhoods. Some they hid underground."" Abu Omar also said ISIS relies heavily on foreign fighters, including Westerners. ""The French, they have so much control -- they're even more extreme than we are,"" the defector said. ""They come from France, but it's as if they have been part of the Islamic State for years."" CNN exclusive: ISIS fighter says U.S. airstrikes not effective . What Americans think . According to a new CNN/ORC International poll, 73% percent of Americans support the U.S.-led coalition of airstrikes in Iraq and Syria -- and most believe ISIS poses some level of threat to the United States. But a majority -- 60% -- also oppose sending ground troops in the fight. Even though Obama has said he will not put combat troops in the region, the United States does have military advisers on the ground training and helping the Iraqi army strategically as it battles ISIS.","ISIS within 3 kilometers of Syrian Kurdish town, resident says .

"It is a scene seared forever into the memory of an eyewitness: . Masked men drag the bloodied body of a man across a public square, and tie it to a make-shift cross on a metal pole. Green string holds the body's arms outstretched across a wood plank as blood oozes from the gunshot wound to his head. Militiamen wrap the body's black ""WhatsApp"" shirt with a sign in red letters that reads in Arabic: ""This man fought Muslims and detonated an IED here."" The eyewitness -- a man we will call Abu Ibrahim -- does more than watch. He steps closer and snaps a picture with his cell phone; the children around him gawk at the horrific spectacle with quiet curiosity. Abu Ibrahim asked that his identity be kept secret for fear of reprisals. His photographs document the story of a body staged to look like a crucifixion -- and to send a message -- in the northern Syrian city of Raqqa. An al Qaeda splinter group, Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), says the brutal display serves as a lesson to anyone who dares challenge its rule. Three days on, the ""crucified"" body of the man and another victim were reportedly still hanging in Raqqa. ""What they are conveying is those who oppose ISIS rule oppose God's rule, and those who are enemies of ISIS are enemies of God and deserve the highest form of punishment possible,"" says Abbas Barzegar, assistant professor of Islamic studies at Georgia State University. The jihadist group carried out a total of seven public executions in Raqqa on Tuesday, but only two bodies were displayed afterward, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group. Abu Ibrahim, a member of a recently formed anti-ISIS activist group in Raqqa, says the remaining five victims were children under the age of 18, one of them a seventh-grade student. The crucifixion displays began in March, when ISIS accused a shepherd of murder and theft, then shot him in the head and tied his lifeless body to a wooden cross. Video on social media showed the body leaning up against a small building painted to bear the group's flag and name. ""These violent acts are part of a fundamentalist revival campaign, but these forms of ancient punishment were rarely if ever seen in the Muslim world in recent centuries,"" Barzegar says. ""It has become a standard feature of fringe Islamist groups to revive these outdated practices in an effort to bring back what they believe is authentic."" There's been no evidence of actual crucifixion, a painful form of execution in which victims were bound or nailed through the hands and feet to a heavy wooden cross and left to suffer until death. All three men in Raqqa were shot in the head prior to being affixed to crosses. The displays of their bodies appear to be largely symbolic acts by ISIS followers against members of their own Sunni Muslim sect for perceived acts of treason. ""ISIS needs to attach meaning to their killing. Simply murdering in a state of constant warfare is void of value, so they must attach a message or propaganda to what they are doing,"" Barzegar says. As Syria's civil war creates a power vacuum, groups like ISIS have stepped in with their own form of radical Sharia law to rule over an exhausted and terrorized civilian population. Edicts often appear overnight on inconspicuous flyers, with dire warnings: . ""All shop owners must close their stores immediately upon the announcement of prayer and go to the mosque,"" a decree posted this week reportedly reads. ""Any violators after the issuance of this announcement will face consequences."" According to a set of rules issued to Raqqa's Christian minority, members of the faith must pay a special tax to the militants and may not expose crosses, repair churches, or recite prayers in the presence of Muslims, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported in February. But while crucifixion holds specific biblical resonance, the bold and brutal displays in Raqqa hold no direct correlation to Christian symbolism, Barzegar says. The ISIS victims whose bodies were strung up on crosses were all Muslim. U.N. chief to Syria: Please don't hold presidential elections . After nearly a year under the repression of ISIS, Abu Ibrahim and about 20 other activists formed a campaign in April that they called ""Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently"" to push the vigilante group out of their hometown. ""After we reached the solid conviction, without the shadow of a doubt, that (Raqqa) served as the stage of a horrific spectacle that deformed the real core of the Syrian revolution,"" the campaigns founding document reads, ""we decided it was about time we stood against those forces of evil."" ISIS reacted almost immediately to the campaign, sentencing the activists to death for ""non-belief in Islam and their advocacy of secularism,"" and offering a large cash prize for any information on their whereabouts, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ""It is our obligation to confront them (ISIS) and if we remain scared of them then they will rule us forever. It is true this is dangerous and we have received more than one death threat, but we are relying on the popularity of our Facebook page as protection,"" Abu Ibrahim told CNN via a choppy Skype connection. On their Facebook page with nearly 12,000 followers, activists post updates on alleged crimes committed against the people of Raqqa and issue calls to action such as proposing a strike by store owners on Saturday to protest an ISIS tax hike. ""Life here is very hard. People are tired and they hate everything. If you don't close your shop during prayer time you get lashes, if you smoke you get lashed, if you say one wrong thing you can be executed. Just like that. It's that easy for ISIS,"" Abu Ibrahim says. The United Nations, the Syrian opposition and human rights groups have corroborated the scenes of horror in Raqqa. Earlier this year, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said reported mass executions in Raqqa may amount to war crimes, and in a separate report issued last month, her office documented torture and mistreatment, including repeated beatings, of prisoners at schools and hospitals controlled by ISIS. ""So many families have had people disappear and they have no idea where they are or what happened to them. The worst part is people are too afraid to ask about their husbands or sons,"" Abu Ibrahim says. After nearly every Friday prayer, a few of these prisoners appear in a public roundabout where dozens of onlookers stand by as charges are hurriedly read and the sentences against the accused carried out, ranging from lashes to executions. Images of the harrowing scenes often circulate on social-media sites, sometimes posted by accounts claiming to be linked to the extremist group. ""It is like a waterfall of blood. There are more and more executions and now the children watch like they are used to it. It is a strange and exciting scene and they are not afraid to look,"" Abu Ibrahim says. ISIS's military offensive against even its former allies and its savage form of justice led the central al Qaeda command to disown its affiliate earlier this year, but the group's leader, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, vowed to remain in Syria and fight all who oppose him, even fellow jihadists. The founders of the peaceful campaign ""Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently"" say they will succeed where others have failed. ""The word is often more powerful than the bullet, and the will of the people is the most powerful of all,"" Abu Ibrahim says. 25 children killed in elementary school bombing, Syrian activists say .","An eyewitness and his pictures document a Syrian scene meant to send a message .

"(CNN) -- Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai said Friday that he'd welcome a Taliban office opening in Turkey, that country's state-run news agency reported, adding that such a development could help peace talks in his war-torn nation. Karzai made his remarks during a joint press conference with Turkish President Abdullah Gul and Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, following a meeting of the three leaders at Istanbul's Ciragan Palace. The Afghan president acknowledged that there have been discussions about Taliban officials setting up somewhere in Turkey ""in order to facilitate reconciliation and integration,"" according to the Turkish news agency Anadolu. ""If Turkey can be kind to provide such a venue we, the government of Afghanistan will be pleased and happy to see that facilitation (in) Turkey,"" said Karzai. The president referenced an article published earlier this week in the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph, in which former Taliban ambassador to Pakistan Mullah Zaeef said that having the Taliban set up an office in a neutral country may help bring about peace. Zaeef -- who served time in the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and is now living openly in Kabul -- suggested that a country like the United Arab Emirates, ""which is not interested in interfering in Afghanistan like Pakistan or China,"" would be a good option. While not an official representative of the Taliban, the former ambassador did attend a meeting in October involving political figures from Pakistan and Afghanistan. Farouq Wardak, Afghanistan's education minister, then said that Kabul was ready to enter a ""new phase"" in building bridges and making peace with the Taliban.","Karzai says there have been talks about a Taliban office in Turkey, state-run media reports .

"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- The next time you land safely in Seattle, you may want to thank Steve Osmek. Wildlife biologist Steve Osmek checks a radar screen for information on birds close to the Seattle airport. He's the wildlife biologist whose job is to make sure that birds don't get in the way of airplanes arriving and departing Seattle Tacoma International Airport. Even though the bird strikes that recently caused US Airways Flight 1549 to lose both engines and land in New York's Hudson River has brought greater urgency to the issue, the danger presented by avian life is nothing new to Sea-Tac. The airport has had a wildlife biologist on staff since the 1970s, Osmek says, and annually spends about $250,000 on bird-removal operations. Osmek and a crew of about 20 helpers use low-tech and high-tech methods to guard against bird strikes. First, they combat the environments that attract birds by planting foliage that prevents them from landing and by covering any nearby bodies of  water with netting. ""The main thing is to make sure the birds are not used to coming here to the airport,"" Osmek says. ""They don't get used to feeding here, nesting here and in turn coming into closer contact with the aircraft."" Birds that still stray into Sea-Tac airspace are harassed relentlessly. Osmek uses a laser with a scope on it to shine a green light near birds. The light flashing near the birds mimics a predator stalking them, Osmek says, and usually causes them to take flight. For more persistent opponents, Osmek reaches into the deep arsenal of what he calls his ""pyrotechnics."" They are explosive shells that he uses to ward off birds -- sometimes large flocks of them -- entering airspace near the airport's three runways. Osmek fires the shells with a variety of pistols or a shotgun. Some boom loudly, and others scream into the sky before blowing up into puffs of smoke. One projectile travels up to 1,200 feet before exploding like a thunderclap. It is intended to ward off high-flying birds like hawks or eagles. Osmek says the pyrotechnics only scare the birds and do not harm them. ""We're not aiming the pyrotechnics right at them,"" he explains. ""We are usually aiming to where we can direct them to a safer place.""  Watch Osmek at work at the airport » . Using the pyrotechnics is also economical. One shell costs about $10, Osmek says, while a bird strike on a plane can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage or much worse. But the airport's most valuable tool, Osmek says, isn't one that scares off birds -- it's one that helps find them. In three separate locations around the airport are avian radar terminals that track the birds within six miles of the airport and up to 3,000 feet. The radar is similar to marine radar but used for a very different application. The avian radar allows the bird crew at the 2,700-acre airport to focus on specific areas. ""[The birds] are objects I don't see with my naked eye, but you look at the radar and it raises your awareness of those areas where you should take another look,"" Osmek explains. ""I may scan with my binoculars, but I might not necessarily know where to scan, but now I know there's a bird there."" Innovations to the radar now help airport staff determine at what altitude the birds are flying. After studying the radar long enough, Osmek can tell from flight patterns what kind of bird he is looking at. It's important when trying to prevent bird strikes to know if you are dealing with a sparrow or Canada goose. Ed Herricks, a University of Illinois professor who placed the radar at Sea-Tac and works with Accipiter, the maker of the radar, says the next challenge for the systems will be further implementing them into airport operations without ""crying wolf."" ""There is a critical need to have the data moved into the decision-making process of controllers and pilots,"" Herricks says. But, he adds: ""You want to be absolutely sure when you say something is there that something is there."" Tim Nohara, the president of Accipiter, foresees a time soon when the radar will not only help biologists on the ground but will be part of the information coming into airport control towers like weather and wind shear data. Electronic alerts could be sent to controllers or pilots if they are flying too closely to a flock of birds, Nohara says. ""With the radar, airports can be much more effective in the strategies they employ,"" Nohara says. And if bird strikes do occur, the radar ""will help investigators determine what happened,"" he says. O'Hare in Chicago, JFK in New York and Dallas Fort-Worth are airports slated to receive similar radar systems this year.","Airport uses low-tech, high-tech methods to ward off bird strikes .

"(CNN)Real Madrid returned to winning ways Saturday with a 3-0 victory over mid-table Espanyol at the Santiago Bernabeu, despite playing the majority of the second half with ten men. The European champions suffered back-to-back defeats against Valencia and city rivals Atletico Madrid in the space of four days last week, bringing a club-record 22-match winning streak that began all the way back in September to an unceremonious end. But first half goals from James Rodriguez and Gareth Bale put Real well on the road to recovery here. Portuguese full-back Fabio Coentrao was sent off for Los Blancos at the beginning of the second half. However, Espanyol couldn't take advantage of its numerical advantage. Instead, substitute Nacho Fernandez added a third for Real 15 minutes from time. It could have been even more had Bale made more of a chance when put through on goal before Nacho sealed the win. But the Welsh winger failed to square the ball to Cristiano Ronaldo who appeared to be in a better position to score. That led to jeers from the home crowd which didn't appreciate the $132 million man's selfishness in front of goal. Yet  after the game, Real boss Carlo Ancelotti was quick to defend Bale when speaking to reporters. ""Bale played a very good game. He had intensity, he scored, he helped in the first goal,"" said Ancelotti in quotes carried by the AFP news agency. ""It could be in this moment the fans asked for a pass to Cristiano that he didn't make because, like all strikers in front of goal, they try to score. ""We have fans that demand a lot and this is good. Bale is a fundamental player like Cristiano and that is why the fans demand more of them."" The result means Real move four points clear at the top of the La Liga table, although that lead will be reduced by either second-placed Barcelona or third-placed Atletico Madrid which face off against one another in the Catalan capital tomorrow evening. Looking beyond that, Ancelotti will be seeking harmony in the squad as Real prepare for the second leg of their Copa Del Rey last-16-tie against city rivals Atletico on Thursday. Atletico triumphed 2-0 in the first leg at the Vicente Calderon last week and Real haven't beaten them in three attempts this season. ""We have time to prepare well,"" Ancelotti said. ""We'll play our strongest team because we want to turn around the result of the first leg and try our best to get to the quarter-finals. ""I think everyone is waiting for this game. It is difficult for us but we are going to play our best and playing at home will help us.""","Ten man Real Madrid defeat Espanyol 3-0 .

"Winston Churchill's ""The Gathering Storm"" describes how Nazi Germany conspired to conquer the democracies, which were unwitting, unprepared and nearly defeated when the storm of World War II finally burst upon them. London stood alone for a time, the solitary champion of freedom in a new kind of war, fought with the revolutionary new technology of massed airpower, in the warring skies over the bombed homes of the heroic city. Victory went to the Allies and freedom prevailed over tyranny in World War II only because a handful of visionary statesmen, scientists and captains of industry prepared for the gathering storm. Churchill and President Franklin Roosevelt did what they could to prepare their reluctant nations to transition from peacetime to a war economy. Rep. Carl Vinson, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, insisted that a skeptical peacetime U.S. Navy build aircraft carriers. Howard Hughes and other pioneers of aviation, during the peace before Pearl Harbor, designed fighters and bombers that won the air war. Albert Einstein, Leo Szilard and other nuclear physicists started the U.S. down the path that became the Manhattan Project and beat the Nazis to the atomic bomb. Today, another gathering storm threatens freedom and the survival of civilization: cyberwarfare. Terrorists and rogue states are making cyberattacks on a daily basis, using computer bugs to probe defenses of U.S. critical infrastructures. The most important critical infrastructure is the electric power grid. Electricity runs and makes possible the operation of all the other critical infrastructures -- communications, transportation, banking and finance, food and water -- that sustain modern civilization and the lives of millions. The biggest cyberthreat is from electromagnetic pulse, which in the military doctrines of potential adversaries would be part of an all-out cyberwar.  A nuclear missile, perhaps launched from a freighter, detonated at high altitude over the U.S. could black out the national grid for months or years, killing an estimated 90% of Americans by starvation, disease and societal collapse.  (And there is also a natural threat: The sun could inflict a worldwide natural EMP catastrophe with a solar flare that generates a rare geomagnetic superstorm, like the 1859 Carrington Event. Such a storm could collapse electric grids everywhere on Earth, endangering billions.) Statements made in Iran, North Korea, China and Russia lend credence to the possibility of EMP attacks against the U.S.  Iran has practiced missile launches from a ship, and North Korea has demonstrated its ability to launch a satellite. Either of these platforms could be used to launch EMP attacks against the United States with little warning. In July, a North Korean freighter detained for drug smuggling was discovered to have nuclear-capable missiles aboard. In a vivid demonstration of the vulnerability of U.S. infrastructure, in April, saboteurs using AK-47s attacked and damaged electric grid transformers near San Jose. The gathering cyberstorm draws near. Although most Americans do not know it, Atlanta, like London during the storm of World War II, is at the center of the gathering cyberstorm that threatens the very existence of the United States. Headquartered in Atlanta is the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, responsible for protecting the national power grid. A corporation proactively protecting the grid would be good for all Americans. Unfortunately, the corporation is not doing its job and has failed to accomplish the most important task of all: making preparations to protect America from a cybercatastrophe. Six years ago, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (PDF) ordered the corporation to produce a plan to protect the electric grid from cyberbugs. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation still has no plan. The corporation flatly refuses to even try producing a plan for grid protection against the gravest cyberthreat, nuclear EMP attack, claiming that protection against such an attack is the job of the Defense Department. In 2012, the corporation wrote a report (PDF) that amounts to ""junk science"" in trying to deny that natural EMP is a catastrophic threat. Members of Congress, in frustration with the corporation, are trying to pass the SHIELD Act, which would empower the Federal Electric Regulatory Commission to order the corporation to protect the grid from EMP. The state of Maine, also in frustration, recently passed a legislative initiative to protect its own grid from EMP. Meeting in Atlanta this week is the National Council of State Legislatures, where all 50 states will be briefed on how they can protect their electric grids without waiting for the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. That corporation should lead, follow or get out of the way of those who are trying to protect our nation from a cybercatastrophe. Otherwise, the Congress that certified it as the electric reliability organization can also decertify it.","Newt Gingrich: Cyberwar is a tool being used by terrorists, rogue states .

"Iraqi security and volunteer forces have broken the siege of Amerli and have entered the town, retired Gen. Khaled al-Amerli, an Amerli resident and member of its self-defense force, told CNN on Sunday. Iraqi state TV also reported that the siege had been broken. The news prompted a wave of celebrations across the town, which had been besieged by fighters from the terror group ISIS. Residents waved the Iraqi flag and fired celebratory shots into the air, al-Amerli said. ""Today is a day of victory for Iraq and the resilient people of Amerli,"" the retired general said. The breakthrough came after the United States said it carried out airstrikes and dropped humanitarian aid in Amerli to protect an ethnic minority that one official said faced the threat of an ""imminent massacre."" Amerli is home to many of Iraq's Shiite Turkmen. Australia, France and the UK also participated in the aid drop. The U.S. military conducted ""coordinated airstrikes"" against ISIS targets as part of an effort to support the humanitarian operation, Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby  said. Video released by the Iraqi Ministry of Defense was strikingly similar to the scenes of the dire situation faced by the Yazidis, who were trapped on Mount Sinjar by ISIS earlier this month. Dozens of people crowded helicopters, hoping to be rescued. Scores more waited  in the scorching summer sun for the arrival of lifesaving supplies. ISIS fighters had surrounded Amerli, 70 miles north of Baquba, since mid-June. The town's fewer than 20,000 residents have been without power. ""Residents are enduring harsh living conditions with severe food and water shortages, and a complete absence of medical services -- and there are fears of a possible imminent massacre,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said last week. ISIS has called the Shiite Turkmen heretics and vowed to push them out. Turkmen are descendants of a Turkic-speaking, traditionally nomadic people, who share cultural ties with Turkey. There are Sunni and Shiite Turkmen in Iraq, and they account for up to 3% of Iraq's population. Turkmen have been subjected to violence before at the hands of Sunni extremists. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, is calling on President Barack Obama and his administration to address the threat posed by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. ""We have to have a clear strategy dictated by a policy and that policy has to be we have to defeat ISIS, not contain, not stop, but defeat ISIS, because they are a direct threat over time to the United States of America,"" McCain said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" McCain was referring to the controversy that erupted last week after the President admitted on Thursday ""we don't have a strategy, yet"" for airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria. Dianne Fienstein, McCain's Senate colleague and chair of the Intelligence Committee Democratic senator, also urged the Obama administration Sunday to devise a strategy for confronting ISIS. Feinstein said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday that ISIS is one of the most vicious terrorist movements ever. ""I think I've learned one thing about this president, and that is he's very cautious.  Maybe in this instance too cautious.  I do know that the military, I know that the state department, I know that others have been putting plans together.  And so hopefully those plans will coalesce into a strategy that can encourage that coalition."" Iraqi forces under a Shiite-led regime, as well as ethnic Kurdish forces, have been battling ISIS, which this year took over large portions of northern and western Iraq and eastern Syria for what it calls its new caliphate. Well before ISIS made gains, Iraq was beset for years by sectarian violence, with Sunnis feeling politically marginalized under a Shiite-led government since the U.S.-led ouster of longtime leader Saddam Hussein in 2003.

"More than 80% of children in Puerto Rico live in high-poverty areas, according to a recent report. That's a sharp difference from national figures measured by the same study, which indicates that 11% of minors across the United States live in high-poverty areas. ""What this implies is that the children of Puerto Rico are facing really great difficulties in order to have the appropriate resources to develop. Whether it is because in their homes there are not enough resources or because in the community where they live there are not enough resources,"" said Nayda Rivera-Hernandez, senior research analyst at the National Council of La Raza. The study, released last week by the Annie E. Casey Foundation and the National Council of La Raza using data from the U.S. Census American Community Survey, showed that the percentage of Puerto Rico's teenagers who are not in school or working is higher than in any U.S. state; at 18%, the rate is twice as high as the national U.S. figure, according to the National Council of La Raza. The report says 56% of Puerto Rican children live in poverty, compared with 22% for the entire United States. For the leaders of the communities along the Martin Pena Canal in San Juan, these statistics give a glimpse what their children live every day. Of the communities' 26,000 residents, 23% are minors. Many of them go to school without supplies. And according to their directors, sometimes the schools themselves don't have the necessary materials for basic studies. But this isn't the greatest problem. One of the most worrying issues here is public health, community leaders say, because the community does not have a sewage system. On rainy days, water flows into the canal, forcing wastewater back into pipes and causing floods that sometimes reach inside homes. ""What keeps impacting us is the problem of polluted water. ... Our children have to put their feet in polluted water. The kids sometimes see little turtles that come out of the canal and they want to pick them up,"" said Lucy Cruz, a community leader. The canal community has more than 80 leaders who say they are actively working to improve the lives of residents -- and their children -- with or without the help of the island's government. According to the American Community Survey, Puerto Rico's poverty rate is about 45% -- three times the national U.S. figure. Puerto Rican government statistics indicate 640,000 families on the island receive food stamps. Rivera-Hernandez, of the National Council of La Raza civil rights group, said officials should devote more resources to helping families on the island. ""When a large majority of our children live in high-poverty areas, in single-parent families, and with parents who lack secure employment, we cannot ignore the threats to their well-being,"" she said. ""If we focus on helping families, then our children will do better. We must target our limited resources to strengthen our children's prospects and help prepare them for the future.""","Researcher: ""The children of Puerto Rico are facing really great difficulties""

"Having willfully avoided direct military involvement in Syria for the past two years, Barack Obama may not be so lucky over the next two. Reports that Bashar al-Assad's forces may have used chemical weapons will almost certainly force the president's hand into a course of action that takes the U.S. beyond the  humanitarian assistance to refugees and the non-lethal aid and training  it's provided to  the rebels. What Obama does on Syria flows directly from what he wants to achieve, or more to the point, what he wants to avoid. And in this case, that means a slippery slide toward military involvement in Syria that incrementally sucks America in without a clear sense of an end game. Indeed, it's been the president's inability to see that end state that has been the single greatest constraint on his willingness to become more involved. And because that's no clearer today, Obama will look for the least risky and encumbering course of action in Syria, and that probably means arming the opposition. Sadly, this is unlikely to significantly accelerate the demise of the al-Assads. In March, the president said that al-Assad's use of chemical weapons would be a game-changer, a red line. Tuesday, he said he needs more evidence before acting. ""When I am making decisions about American national security and the potential for taking additional action in response to chemical weapons use, I have to make sure I have the facts,"" he said. Paradoxically, the chemical weapons issue isn't so much a revolutionary departure point for the president as much as it is the impetus for another incremental move in a complicated calculus of how Obama tries to find a way to stay out of Syria. And who could blame him? Despite the moral, humanitarian and strategic arguments for intervention, Syria is a trap  that threatens to suck external powers in and shackle them with responsibility for war-making, peacekeeping and a reconstruction effort that could eventually involve thousands of boots on the ground and billions of dollars in assistance. And it's been clear from the beginning that Obama has no intention of getting stuck with the check. His calculations are pretty obvious ones. Having laid the groundwork for taking America out of wars that have been the two longest and among the most profitless in its history, Obama has no intention of getting America into new ones. Syria isn't Libya, a country without serious defenses, allies and chemical weapons that represents low-hanging fruit for any military planner.  And Obama's priorities reflect the desires of the American people, which run to fixing America's own broken house, not chasing around the world looking for others to repair. And while's there's no evidence to prove this, Obama's cautious calculation on Syria is probably also driven by Iran. This isn't the conventional notion banging around Washington that the best way to weaken the mullahs is to push al-Assad out but the president's sense that when the moment of decision comes on Iran, he'll need Russian and Chinese support and as much flexibility as possible if he needs to launch military strikes. He knows he won't get Russian support on Syria and Iran. And he doesn't want to be engaged in military campaigns on two fronts (and in Afghanistan) if he's going to war with the mullahs. All of Obama's calculations have now been challenged by what appears to be al-Assad's use  of chemicals. And he's now forced to consider violating his own red line on   military action in Syria. The chemical weapons issue challenges him in three ways: First, it undermines his personal credibility. If Obama declared that the use of chemical weapons would be a game-changer and nothing happens, America's credibility is lost in the yawning gap between the president's words and deeds. The red line turns pink; once again, America's street cred is undermined in a region where  power is respected. Second, if Obama doesn't impose some cost on the regime, al-Assad may use chemicals again, perhaps this time in a more expansive way. The Syrians have introduced  more muscular military tactics against the  opposition gradually: first artillery, then air power and then surface-to-surface missiles. The alleged use of sarin gas may well be part of that pattern. Obama must try to break it. And third, the world is watching.  If the president can't enforce his own red line on chemicals, what do you think our adversaries (North Korea and Iran) and friends (Israel and Saudi Arabia) will conclude on the nuclear issue? So the question is not whether to act but how. And the answer from Obama's perspective is to identify the least risky option. If the president wanted to bring down the regime more quickly, he'd develop a three-pronged strategy to create offensive no-fly zones protecting rebel sanctuaries near the Turkish and Jordanian borders using Patriot missile batteries; proactively suppress Syrian air defenses; and then launch air and cruise missile strikes against Syrian military assets and even leadership targets. Shock and Awe the Syrians for several weeks. But that's not his inclination or that of his military advisers. As recently as Tuesday, Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, was still being super cautious on a no-fly zone. What Obama is likely to do -- and the signals from the White House are clearer than ever -- is to begin providing lethal assistance to opposition elements that have been carefully vetted and covert assistance to coordinate delivery and training. Help the rebels to help themselves and avoid, at least for now, direct U.S. military intervention.  The real question is whether the administration is prepared to provide even those ""koshered"" rebel groups, those without ties to Sunni extremists and an inclusive approach to the new Syria, with the ""manpads"": portable surface-to-air missiles and anti-armor weapons in sufficient quantities that might be effective against al-Assad's air and armor. There's a real risk that weapons could end up in the wrong hands, used against Americans or other Syrian opposition groups in the ongoing struggle for Syria and between Sunnis and Shiites. The fact is, Obama has no good options. He'll pick the least worst one, providing some kind of weapons to the rebels. That will make us feel better, neutralize the liberal interventionists and conservative Republicans who've been blasting him and respond to those who say he's backing away from his red line. It won't turn the tide in Syria or necessarily prevent al-Assad from using chemical weapons. The other alternatives -- do nothing or design a proactive and comprehensive military strategy to take out the al-Assads -- aren't in the cards. But make no mistake: Sooner rather than later, the president will likely be faced with another decision point along the slippery slope of U.S. military intervention in Syria.","Aaron Miller says President Obama has no good choices on Syria .

"When Omar left home in 2013, his parents thought he was going to help out at a refugee camp for the victims of Syria's brutal civil war. But the soft-spoken Danish student wasn't on a humanitarian mission -- he had joined the ranks of a jihadist brigade fighting to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But Omar -- whose name has been changed to conceal his identity -- soon realized that what he was seeing on the battlefield was different from what he thought he'd signed up for. ""The place I was in, there was some chaos between different groups and there was violence between different groups,"" Omar, who is in his early twenties, told CNN. ""I went there to fight Bashar al-Assad and not to fight other Islamic groups."" Omar didn't want to be a part of that. Fed up with the infighting, he decided to return home. In 2013, a U.N.-sponsored panel declared Denmark the world's happiest place to live, citing a number of factors including life expectancy, social support and the freedom to make life choices. But the wealthy Scandinavian country is also becoming known for something altogether more worrying -- one of Europe's highest rates of jihadi fighters. At least 100 Danes are believed to have left the country to fight in Syria and Iraq. Of 25 countries CNN surveyed last month, only three had a higher proportion of Muslims leaving to fight. The country is facing a dilemma: what to do when these fighters come home? Aarhus, Denmark's second largest city, thinks it has the answer -- a controversial program for rehabilitating jihadis returning home from Syria that doesn't necessarily involve jail time. Here's how the program works: Any returning fighter is eligible for help getting a job, a house, an education, and psychological counseling -- just like any other Danish citizen. Those returning must be screened by police, and anyone found to have committed a crime will be put through the courts and possibly prison. The program does not try to change the fundamentalist beliefs of the returning fighters -- as long as they don't advocate violence. WATCH: How Denmark's de-radicalization program works . Aarhus seems to have an especially acute problem with foreign fighters. More than 30 young people -- including Omar -- left the city last year to fight in Syria. Sixteen of them have since returned. Omar was pursuing an engineering degree at university before he went to Syria. He has been there twice since. Omar said he wasn't nervous about coming back home. Unlike in some other countries, it is not a crime in Denmark to fight in Syria. ""It wasn't illegal to fight in Syria unless you fought for a group that was a terrorist organization,"" Omar explained. ""It was not a big deal for me to come back and get back to the daily life I had before I left."" Omar knows the people who run the de-radicalization program, but he hasn't joined it because he doesn't think he needs help reintegrating into society. But some of friends have joined the program and are satisfied with it. Police here say it's a Danish solution that's not particularly special -- it's simply a crime prevention program with a focus on jihadis. ""We can't just put young people in custody because they plan to go to Syria,"" explained Aarhus Police Commissioner Jorgen Ilum. ""It is not illegal according to Danish law to go to Syria, but we could try to persuade the young people not to go to Syria."" ""We could tell them about the risks that they might encounter going to Syria. We could tell them about the Danish legislation that makes it illegal to participate in direct terrorist acts and if they did do they might be punished when they come back. We could offer the parents and young people the mentoring help or help from psychologists in order to get some tools in how to deal with this problem."" Of the roughly 30 people that left Aarhus for Syria last year, 22 had some sort of association with the city's Grimhojvej Mosque, according to Ilum. Sixteen have since returned back to Denmark. WATCH: Why are there so many jihadis from Denmark? The mosque has come under severe criticism from right-wing Danish politicians who say Grimhojvej's leaders are trying to radicalize their followers. Some have even called for the mosque to be closed down. Mosque officials told CNN they were surprised that so many of their members had left for Syria -- but said they had been working with police on the best way to approach young Muslims. ""The only and the most important thing that we want to see is that they don't consider us as criminals,"" said Oussama El-Saadi, the mosque's chairman. ""They don't consider us as terrorists, and they recognize us as minority living in Denmark and will continue living in Denmark and that we are a part of this society."" El-Saadi said young people from his mosque started traveling to Syria because they wanted to make a difference. And El-Saadi refused to condemn the brutality of the radical Islamist groups -- like ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra -- that are running rampant in the war-torn country. ""We are here in Denmark, so far away from the area around there,"" he told CNN. ""We are not condemning or supporting any group down there because we don't have the information."" El-Saadi said that jihadis returning to Denmark were probably turned off by the infighting between the various Muslim groups battling for control of Syria, or that they simply wanted to return to a more normal life of school and work. The Danish program lies in stark contrast to the approach of the United Kingdom. Fighters returning to Britain often face surveillance, terror charges, and jail time. Officials say that roughly 500 people living in the UK have left to fight in Syria and Iraq. Britain is also looking at measures to ban fighters from returning home under the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPims). There is fear that returning fighters might carry out terror activity at home. WATCH: Is de-radicalization possible in Britain? Omar criticized Britain's approach to returning jihadis. ""The UK government treat the people in a harsh way compared to Denmark,"" he said. ""They start taking away people's passports and start harassing them by raiding their homes, taking some of them to prison and these things."" ""I have spoken to a lot of Western people in Syria and nobody has ever talked about getting back to plan to bomb these countries, as they try to make it sound like in the media."" There are several de-radicalization programs in the UK -- mostly aimed at preventing people already in Britain from becoming radicalized -- but none specifically targeted towards citizens returning from Syria. In 2008, the British government spent £140 million on countering extremism. That has now dwindled to just £1.7 million. A spokesman for Britain's Home Office told CNN: ""We take the risk of those returning from Syria very seriously. Some of these people may have been exposed to traumatic experiences and others may be radicalised or vulnerable to radicalisation."" ""In the UK we work with our partners, including the police and health service, to determine how we can best support returnees from areas of conflict and help them successfully reintegrate into society."" So does the Danish method actually work? Jorgen Ilum seems to think so. ""I should say that in 2014 I can see after we started this contact dialogue with the mosque and the youth center, only one [person] to our knowledge has left to Syria -- in comparison to 30 in 2013 before we had this contact,"" Ilum said. Ilum said Danish fighters have to be motivated to be productive members of society. ""We see it as a very important crime prevention effort to try to reintegrate these people back into the society,"" he said. ""Many of the people who come back, they are rather disillusioned about what they have seen in Syria. It's not what they had expected or heard or seen over the internet."" ""What we have seen is out of the 16 that have returned ... 10 of them are now back in school and have a job -- it seems to us that their focus is on something else other than Syria."" Preben Bertelsen, a professor of psychology at the University of Aarhus, has been involved with the city's program for the last two years, providing counseling to returning fighters. He is aware the program might not work for everyone. ""If [someone] doesn't want our help, we can't really reach him,"" he told CNN. ""All of these youngsters are screened for criminal acts out there. If they have done something like that, then the other part of society -- police enforcement -- will take over."" It's too soon to know whether the program will be a success in the long term. But police say the alternative would be fighters that return and simply disappear. This program is designed to help while also keeping a close watch. ""Young people have a lot of feelings. So if you are going to be humble towards those returned fighters, they will be humble towards you. If you are going to be harsh towards them, they are going to be harsh towards you. This is how young people think,"" Omar said. In the meantime, Omar says he will keep working to complete his education -- and that he plans to go back to Syria after graduation.","Denmark has unveiled a controversial de-radicalization program for jihadis returning from Syria .

"(CNN)  -- The terrorist threat posed by radicalized Muslim- Americans has been exaggerated, according to a study released Wednesday by researchers at Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A small number of Muslim-Americans have undergone radicalization since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, the study found. It compiled a list of 139 individuals it categorized as ""Muslim-American terrorism offenders"" who had become radicalized in the U.S. in that time -- a rate of 17 per year. That level is ""small compared to other violent crime in America, but not insignificant,"" according to the study, titled ""Anti-Terror Lessons of Muslim-Americans."" To be included on the list, an offender had to have been wanted, arrested, convicted or killed in connection with terrorism-related activities since 9/11 -- and have lived in the United States, regardless of immigration status, for more than a year prior to arrest. Of the 139 offenders, fewer than a third successfully executed a violent plan, according to a Duke University statement on the study, and most of those were overseas. Read the report:""Anti-Terror Lessons of Muslim-Americans"" ""Muslim-American organizations and the vast majority of individuals that we interviewed firmly reject the radical extremist ideology that justifies the use of violence to achieve political ends,"" David Schanzer, an associate professor in Duke's Sanford School of Public Policy and director of the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security, said in the statement. In the aftermath of 9/11, however, as well as terrorist attacks elsewhere in the world, the possible radicalization of Muslim-Americans is a ""key counterterrorism concern"" -- magnified by heavy publicity that accompanies the arrests of Muslim-Americans, such as that seen in the wake of the November shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, in which 13 people were killed. Army psychiatrist Maj. Nidal Hasan, a Muslim born in Virginia, is charged in connection with that incident. Other high-profile incidents include the charging of eight Somali-American men on charges related to what authorities say are efforts to recruit youths from the Minneapolis, Minnesota, area to fight for al-Shabaab, a Somali guerrilla movement battling the African country's U.N.-backed transitional government. At least two young men from Minnesota have been killed in Somalia, including one who blew himself up in what is believed to have been the first suicide bombing carried out by a naturalized U.S. citizen. In addition, five Americans were arrested last month in Pakistan, and police have said they are confident that they were planning terrorist attacks. A Pakistani court Monday gave police two weeks to prepare their case against the five; authorities have said they plan to prosecute the youths under the country's anti-terrorism act. But it is the Muslim-American communities themselves who play a large role in keeping the number of radicalized members low through their own practices, according to the study. Leaders and Muslim-American organizations denounce violent acts, for instance, in messages that have weight within communities. In addition, such communities often self-police -- confronting those who express radical ideology or support for terrorism and communicating concerns about radical individuals to authorities. Some Muslim-Americans have adopted programs for youth to help identify those who react inappropriately to controversial issues so they can undergo counseling and education, the researchers said. ""Muslim-American communities have been active in preventing radicalization,"" said Charles Kurzman, professor of sociology at UNC, in the statement. ""This is one reason that Muslim-American terrorism has resulted in fewer than three dozen of the 136,000 murders committed in the United States since 9/11."" However, ""since 9/11, there has been increased tension among Muslim-Americans about their acceptance in mainstream American society,"" the study said. Muslim-Americans report feeling a stronger anti-Muslim bias from the media as well as from day-to-day interactions. ""While Muslim-Americans understand and support the need for enhanced security and counterterrorism initiatives, they believe that some of these efforts are discriminatory, and they are angered that innocent Muslim-Americans bear the brunt of the impact of these policies."" Steps can be taken to minimize radicalization among Muslim-Americans, the study said. The most important is encouraging political mobilization among Muslims, which helps prevent radicalization and also demonstrates to Muslims abroad ""that grievances can be resolved through peaceful democratic means."" Policymakers should include Muslim-Americans in their outreach efforts, and public officials should attend events at mosques, as they do churches and synagogues, the study recommended. Also, Muslim-American communities should widely disseminate their condemnation of terrorism and violence, and those statements should be publicized, the study said. Law enforcement has a role to play as well, by making efforts to increase the level of trust and communication with such communities. This could include the cultivation of Muslim-American informants, the study suggested, a policy that could be developed and openly discussed with community leaders. Governments can promote and encourage the building of strong Muslim-American communities and promote outreach by social services agencies, the study said. ""Our research suggests that Muslim-American communities desire collaboration and outreach with the government beyond law enforcement, in areas such as public health, education and transportation."" And the Muslim-American community can promote enhanced education about its religion and beliefs, the study said. Increased civil rights enforcement can also be an important tool. However, policies that alienate Muslims may increase the threat of homegrown terrorism rather than reducing it, the study said. ""Our research suggests that initiatives that treat Muslim-Americans as part of the solution to this problem are far more likely to be successful,"" said Schanzer. Schanzer, Kurzman and Ebrahim Moosa, associate professor of religion at Duke, co-authored the study, which summarized two years of research involving interviews of more than 120 Muslims in four different communities nationwide -- Seattle, Washington; Houston, Texas; Buffalo, New York; and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina. The study was funded by a grant from the Department of Justice.","Study released Wednesday by researchers at Duke University and UNC-Chapel Hill .

"(CNN)The combination is lethal and becoming all too familiar: a long criminal record, easy access to weapons, a loathing of the countries where they were born and deep-seated anti-Semitism. So it was with the perpetrators of the Paris attacks. Now, it appears to fit the description of the man who killed two people in Denmark at the weekend. Danish police describe him as 22 years of age, born in Denmark, with a violent past, connections with gangs and weapons offenses. Jens Madsen, head of the Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET), said investigators were ""operating under a theory"" the attack could have been inspired by last month's attacks in Paris, which were also aimed at cartoonists. Carsten Ellegaard Christensen, national security reporter at the Danish newspaper Jyllands Posten, told CNN the gunman was on the radar of Danish police and PET for gang-related activity but not extremism, according to his security sources. The gunman had recently spent time in jail for a knife attack. ""There is a closer nexus between immigrant criminal gangs and violent extremists in Denmark than anywhere else,"" says Magnus Ranstorp of the Swedish National Defence College. ""This interface makes violent extremists more dangerous as they are able to switch between roles and skill-sets and have easier access to illicit weapons on the underground market."" The so-called ""Nordic biker war"" of the 1990s saw gang members in Denmark and Sweden attack each other with automatic weapons, grenades, and explosive devices. Morten Storm, a former Danish jihadist, moved from being part of a biker gang to Islamist extremism to spying for Western intelligence. He says that belonging to gangs and extremist groups had made him feel he belonged to a ""band of brothers."" In 2012, a convicted drug trafficker and gang leader -- known as Big A -- traveled to Syria to take up arms against the Assad regime. His real name was Abderozzak Benarabe. The subject of a TV documentary last year by Nagieb Khaja, Benarabe returned to Copenhagen where he allegedly raised some $75,000 for the cause. He is now in prison after conviction on aggravated assault charges unrelated to terrorism. There is a long history of jihadist activism in Denmark, and intelligence officials believe at least 110 Danes, both converts to Islam and Muslims since birth, have traveled to Syria and Iraq. Some estimates put the number as high as 200. At least 16 Danes have been killed in Syria and Iraq, according to PET, including 2 women. Last year, ISIS claimed several Danish suicide bombers had carried out attacks in Iraq, including Abu Khattab al Denmarki, said to have carried out an attack in Diyala province, and Abu Sa'ad al Denmarki, who detonated a car bomb close to an Iraqi military convoy near Mosul. It is believed as many as 70 Danish nationals have returned from Syria to Denmark. Within Denmark, according to PET's latest assessment, there are ""people who sympathize with militant Islamism, but have not been in the conflict zone."" They may be ""inspired by individuals or groups in the conflict zone or elsewhere abroad,"" a danger heightened by Denmark's participation in the international coalition against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Recent postings on jihadist forums have singled out Denmark as a target. One entitled ""O Lone Wolves, You who Reside Among the Infidels, Your Turn has Come,"" and posted last month, urged ""sons of Islam, in Europe, America, Australia, France, and Denmark"" to ""light fires beneath their feet."" ""Developments in the Middle East in general, including in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, increase the threat of attack in the West against Israeli or Jewish targets,"" PET warned. A number of jihadist conspiracies in Denmark have been foiled in recent years, but early in 2013 a man tried to shoot the writer Lars Hedegaard, a prominent critic of Islam, at his home in Copenhagen. Hedegaard was not injured, but his assailant escaped on foot. Among scores of Danish jihadists to have traveled overseas in recent years was Mustapha Darwich Ramadan, who had spent time in prison for armed robbery in the 1990s. He eventually traveled to Iraq where he joined al Qaeda. Ramadan took part in the beheading of the American Nick Berg in 2004 before being killed fighting U.S. forces in Fallujah. Much more recently, according to Flashpoint Partners, a group that tracks jihadist activity, a Danish national called Abu Ikramah Al-Pakistani was killed in Anbar Province, Iraq. He was not the first to make the journey. In August 2013, a group of Danes in Syria released a video in which they fired at pictures of six Danish ""kuffar attacking Islam"" -- among them Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Secretary-General of NATO, Morten Storm, and the cartoonist Kurt Westergaard. Denmark has been the focus of militants' anger since the newspaper Jyllands Posten published Westergaard's cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed in 2005. In an edition of its online magazine, Inspire, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula called for the murder of Westergaard -- as well as Carsten Luste, the editor of the paper when the cartoons were published, and Lars Vilks, the Swedish cartoonist who was attending the free speech forum in Copenhagen that was attacked at the weekend. Westergaard is under police protection in Denmark after a conspiracy to murder him was uncovered in 2008, and a 28-year old Somali believed to have ties to Al-Shabaab tried to kill him in 2010. In 2012, three Swedish nationals and a Tunisian resident of Sweden were found guilty of targeting Jyllands Posten in an al Qaeda plot. Prosecutors accused the four suspects of planning a gun attack on the newspaper, to be followed by ""the execution"" of hostages. They had been tracked from Sweden and arrested in Copenhagen in a joint operation between Swedish and Danish intelligence. Denmark has a large immigrant population from the Muslim world -- including Palestinians, Turks, Somalis, Bosnians, Moroccans and Tunisians. While the vast majority have integrated peacefully, a small fraction of ""second generation"" immigrants -- as in France -- have adopted militant Salafism, especially in Odense, Aaarhus and parts of the capital. In 2010, one counterterrorism expert, Michael Taarnby, told CNN that out of Denmark's population of some 18,000 Somalis, there were at least 300 sympathizers of Al-Shabaab, the jihadist group in Somalia that is now an affiliate of al Qaeda. ""Those attracted are usually quite young -- there's the usual issue of a clash of cultures, of being stuck between east Africa and Scandinavia and not knowing where they belong,"" Taarnby told CNN. That clash of cultures threatens to shed more blood on the streets of Europe's major cities.","Denmark has a long history of jihadist activism .

"Russia's annexation of Crimea, and what many fear is its apparent threat to invade Ukraine, has riveted international attention since the crisis erupted with February's revolution in Kiev. Excitable talk has proliferated as fast as North Korean missiles. Pundits obsess about a new Cold War, a showdown with ""mad bad Vlad"" Putin, and the resulting need to boost military spending (always a Pentagon favorite). The talk is all Ukraine, Ukraine. Politicians and diplomats have put everything else on hold. Including Syria, which is a big mistake. Far more than an argument over an obscure shard of territory on the edge of Nowhere-on-Don, the catastrophe now taking place in and around Syria ranks as a fundamental challenge and threat to the current world order. Syria, not Crimea, directly affects western security in very basic ways. What's happening there is changing the power balance in the Middle East. And unlike in Ukraine or the Baltic republics or other post-Soviet lands, a vast human catastrophe is unravelling, apparently without end. In Syria's real, not phoney, war, more than 100,000 people have died so far. The total number of Syrian refugees in Lebanon, for example, has now passed the 1 million mark, according to the U.N.'s refugee agency -- and that does not include the tens of thousands who have not registered with the agency. About 12,000 are fleeing Syria for Lebanon each week. The refugee outflow is also affecting Jordan, Turkey, Egypt and Iraq. As the war enters its fourth year, the overall refugee total is around 2.5 million. A further 6.5 million Syrians are internally displaced, and 9.3 million are in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the U.N. The suffering concealed behind these bald figures is appalling, as any visitor to the refugee camps will testify. Children are particularly badly affected. Yet even if they are not swayed by the human cost of a conflict that has become depressingly familiar, basic considerations of self-interested realpolitik suggest governments, politicians and diplomats should be paying more attention to Syria. One obvious reason is the way the war has been exploited to facilitate the spread of Islamist fundamentalism. Large areas of northern Syria are now under the control of jihadi groups and militias who, whatever else they may disagree about, are united in their opposition to western values and interests. Syria is in the process of becoming a bridgehead to Europe for al Qaida and like-minded fanatics. It is already a magnet for young European Muslim men who want a piece of the global jihad. They then bring their new ""skills"" home. A second reason to take a second look at Syria is the way instability there is steadily spreading outwards to affect neighboring countries. Turkey's neo-Islamist government, having initially tried to broker a peace deal, now regards itself as virtually at war with Bashar al-Assad's regime. Last week the Turks very deliberately shot down a Syrian warplane they said had violated their airspace. The threat of a Syria-Turkey conflict aside, the impact on Turkey's politics and people has been considerable. The increasingly authoritarian behaviour of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's prime minister, to some degree reflects the pressure the country is under. Kurdish militants trying to make common cause with their divided Syrian counterparts is one concern. Another is that border areas inundated with refugees are becoming less governable. Growing instability and consequent political uncertainty are also affecting pro-western Lebanon and Jordan, while apparently reviving Shia-Sunni conflict in Iraq is being fed by the Syrian flames. Recent reports suggest many Iraqi Shia fighters are now inside Syria, determined (like the Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon) to bolster the Assad regime against its mostly Sunni foes. In geopolitical terms, the Syrian collapse has provided Iran with an opportunity to extend its influence into the heart of the Arab world, opening up a new front in its proxy war with the Sunni monarchies of the Gulf led by Saudi Arabia. No doubt to Iran's delight, Riyadh's displeasure at the Obama administration's refusal to get directly involved in Syria has caused a rift between the two long-time allies. Given the current state of western relations with Tehran, handing Iran a free boost in this way is a serious diplomatic own goal. The ongoing failure to address and resolve the Syrian conflict has numerous other far-reaching consequences. What goes for Iran goes for Russia, too. Its obstinate and unprincipled support for Assad has come cost-free as the U.S. and Europe dither and the Geneva ""peace process"" leads precisely nowhere. Perceived American weakness over Syria may even have encouraged Vladimir Putin in his Crimean misdemeanors. Al-Assad's continued survival as Syria's head of state is an egregious affront to the U.N. Security Council and its various related Syria resolutions, to the U.N. charter, to international law, and specifically to international war crimes legislation. Al-Assad stands accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, not least over the use by his forces of chemical weapons against civilian populations. But once again, nothing much is done, and the credibility of such institutions and laws suffers as a result. The moral example set by such dereliction is shocking. A lot has been made of the bad precedent Russia set by annexing the territory of an independent sovereign state. And it is fair to say such behavior is unacceptable and illegal, and should not be emulated by others. But in the overall scheme of things, the Crimea problem fades into insignificance when set alongside the dreaded ramifications and implications, short and long term, of the international community's plain inability or its lamentable lack of will to halt the Syrian war.","Russia's annexation of Crimea, and feared threat to invade Ukraine, has grabbed attention .

"A senior Somali militant who had a $5 million U.S. bounty on his head has been killed in infighting among members of the al Qaeda-aligned group Al-Shabaab, a spokesman for the group said Saturday. Ibrahim Al Afghani, a senior member of Al-Shabaab, was killed along with another top member, Moalim Burhan, in a shootout between two factions of the group June 20, spokesman Abu Musab said. Al Afghani was wanted for terrorism by the U.S. State Department, which offered a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to his location. A U.S. administration official said the United States believes the report of his death is true. It is the first time Al-Shabaab has confirmed the killing of two of its most senior members. The internal fighting in Al-Shabaab is between two groups, one loyal to founding member Ahmed Godane and another, smaller faction that supports foreign jihadists in Somalia. It began about a month ago when a member of the smaller group was targeted in a tea shop, allegedly by members from the other side. Al Afghani and Burhan were both members of the smaller faction. The main Al-Shabaab group denies there is infighting and blames reports of a split on local media. Musab said the two men were killed when Al-Shabaab fighters tried to arrest them for supporting foreign jihadists and the pair fought back. He said Al Afghani and Burhan were not killed intentionally. Residents of the town where the men were killed described heavy fighting between opposing sides of Al-Shabaab. They told the private Shabelle Media Network that they fear war between the two factions could break out at any time. In addition to the killing of the two, a prominent Somali militant leader was arrested by pro-government forces and turned over to the government in Mogadishu.

"Conversations about refereeing controversies in the National Football League have run amok this week. Sunday's disputed, last-second field goal by the Baltimore Ravens that gave them a 31-30 win over the New England Patriots first set tongues wagging. But that uproar was comfortably outdone the next night by an even more controversial, game-winning score -- this one by the Seattle Seahawks, which resulted in their narrowly defeating the Green Bay Packers. This play -- both the lack of a blatant offensive pass interference call and officials' determination that Seattle's Golden Tate deserved a touchdown, despite evidence indicating the ball was intercepted -- spurred vitriol on Twitter and criticism from pundits and fans alike. For many, it illustrated the credibility problem plaguing the league during its season's first three weeks with replacement officials on the field, in place of regular referees who were locked out by the NFL in a prolonged contract dispute. This storm subsided late Wednesday, when NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell temporarily lifted the lockout to allow the ""regular"" referees to officiate Thursday's game between the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens. NFL officials remain locked out until a new collective bargaining agreement is voted on by the union membership. About time,' players, fans say as NFL officials return . Goodell has had his critics, including those up in arms over the league's handling of the latest officiating issues. But it is worth pointing out that the sport has at times been a trailblazer in the field of technology, making soccer -- or football as it's known outside the United States -- look like it is still stuck in the dark ages. The NFL introduced an instant replay system in 1986, allowing officials to review and possibly overturn calls on the field. This system at first didn't take and was scrapped, but an improved replay system was reintroduced in 1999. Since then, instant replay has been a key feature of the sport, with coaches allowed to challenge a call. Each time, play is halted while the on-field referee watches a replay of the disputed incident from the sidelines and makes his final call. In all, two challenges are allowed per side per game -- the limited number is to ensure games don't totally lose their flow or get too long -- and an additional challenge is permitted if the first two are proved correct. In the final two minutes of each half, no coach challenges are allowed, but an additional official, watching from overhead in the press box, can intercede over any controversial decisions. As seen this week, the instant replay system isn't foolproof. But problems about officiating decisions have, in the past decade or so, become increasingly reduced now that there's an avenue for calls to be overturned. This has not been the case, however, in soccer. ""The NFL embraced technology early on, and it's much more progressive than other sports, even in America, like baseball,"" said Nat Coombs, a commentator on both sports for British broadcasters Channel 4 and the BBC, as well as ESPN. ""With better camera angles and social media with armchair referees, there's more pressure than ever for the officials to get it right, so it's logical to embrace and adapt the technology,"" he added. NFL's stop-start nature lends itself better to such a system, whereas in soccer there has been a reluctance to introduce technology because of fears it could break up the game's flow. Resistance has been voiced by the likes of UEFA President Michel Platini who, in an interview this week, once again professed his dislike for goal line technology. ""You will never convince me on technology, and I will not change at the age of 57,"" said Platini, a Frenchman. ""Technology assisting referee, I say 'no'. My idea is to help referees by putting up more referees."" Such a system has been tried in the Europa League since 2009 and was used at the recent Euro 2012 tournament. But mistakes were still made. Notably Marko Devic's ""goal"" for Ukraine against England, which looked to have crossed the line, would have been allowed had technology been in place. It was an incident at the 2010 World Cup that finally convinced world governing body FIFA and, more specifically, president Sepp Blatter, of the need for change. A shot from England's Frank Lampard -- which was comfortably inside the German goal line -- was not ruled a goal. Ultimately, the British fell by a 4-1 score. ""I have to say, 'Thank you, Lampard',"" said Blatter at the time. ""I was completely down in South Africa -- when I saw that it really shocked me. It took me a day to react."" The lack of goal line technology in soccer is hard for Coombs' American colleagues and friends to comprehend. ""The lack of technology was the overriding issue (some Americans) had with regards to the World Cup,"" said Coombs. ""They're just astonished there's not a review, that it's just unprofessional and illogical."" Navigating injury: Can GPS help reduce player burnout? If the beast that is soccer has taken its time to crank into life over the use of technology, other sports like cricket and tennis have been solid bedfellows with the NFL in providing help to umpires and officials. In all those sports, the NFL included, there were skeptics when technology was introduced. ""There's always been a fear that it makes a game more stop-and-start,"" said Coombs, arguing that in each case instant replay has made sports better. ""The drama of a challenge in the NFL is incredible. It creates a great buzz for all the spectators. ""I'd love to see it come into (soccer). The good would far outweigh the bad and in a few weeks of it being introduced everyone will be thinking why didn't we have this before."" The Premier League is among those planning to use goal line technology next season, a decision that has been welcomed by the vast majority of the league, including Chelsea manager Roberto di Matteo. ""We see every season, every big tournament, we need it because there are some crucial moments within those games where you could find the right solution with a bit of technology,"" said the Chelsea boss. There is a parallel between soccer and the NFL in the way players, coaches and fans have a tendency to berate officials, as has been seen in abundance in the United States this week. Patriots quarterback Tom Brady stepped in to ease the row over the controversial ruling in his game this week, when the Ravens' field goal attempt soared toward the uprights -- and through them, according to the officials in the field, if not to New England fans. When asked whether the field goal had or had not gone through, he said: ""From the angle that I have, I can't tell. Those guys are standing at the uprights. So, if they can't get it right, then nobody can."" That throws up the question of further technology. Had cameras been in place on the goalposts then the matter would not even have been a talking point this week. As an aside, American comedian Adam Carolla has a stand-up routine in which he suggests posts rise up to 500 feet in the air to avoid any issue. On a serious note, that is a potential issue for Goodell and the NFL commission to address, and one that Coombs believes they will. ""It's such a forward-thinking sport in terms of technology that after what happened, I wouldn't be surprised if that matter is already being addressed,"" said Coombs. For now, though, Goodell has more instant and pressing matters to contend with.","The National Football League has used officiating technology on and off for the last 26 years .
Soccer has never implemented technology, instead using extra officials .

"(CNN)Roger Federer completed his 999th career victory Saturday as he outclassed Grigor Dimitrov in the semifinals of the Brisbane International. The stylish Swiss took just 53 minutes to win in straight sets 6-2 6-2 and ease into Sunday's final with Milos Raonic. The big-serving Canadian defeated Kei Nishikori 7-6 6-7 7-6 in the day's other semi-final. If Federer triumphs Sunday, he will chalk up his 83rd career title and become only the third man to record 1,000 ATP Tour wins after Ivan Lendl and Jimmy Connors. ""I was able to play straightforward tennis ... just really aggressive,"" said Federer in comments carried by the ATP Tour website. ""Against a really good player, it's a great result."" Federer hinted that the quickfire nature of the victory could give him the edge against Raonic Sunday. "" (I'm) happy I didn't waste much energy like this,"" he said. ""I'm fresh for the finals. I've probably got a slight advantage over Milos in that regard."" Referring to the 1,000 victory milestone on court immediately after the match, Federer added that it will be a proud moment when it happens. ""I hope it's going to happen in Australia, lets put it that way,"" he said. ""Either tomorrow or next week at the Aussie Open,"" which begins in Melbourne on January 19. ""It would be unbelievable to get a 1,000th win the finals, especially here in Brisbane."" ""I've enjoyed myself so much here in the last couple of years. I'll try hard, I'll give everything."" Meanwhile, in the women's final late Saturday, Maria Sharapova scored a thrilling three-set victory over Ana Ivanovic of Serbia to claim the 34th title of her career. Sharapova won 6-7 6-3  6-3 after a tense match lasting over two and a half hours on the Pat Rafter Arena. Top seed Sharapova had to come from a set behind  to see off the determined challenge of former world number one Ivanovic. Two breaks of service in the deciding set settled the match in the Russian's favor as she prepares for the Australian Open in Melbourne.","Roger Federer is one match shy of his 1,000th career victory .

"Sen. Bernie Sanders, one of the Senate's leading doves, said Tuesday he doesn't want the United States leading the fight against ISIS. Instead, said the Vermont senator, who is eyeing a 2016 presidential bid, the nation should be focused on helping the middle class. Sanders, an Independent who caucuses with Democrats, said he doesn't want to see the United States fall into another ""quagmire in the Middle East,"" and he put the onus on Muslim countries to take on ISIS. ""I'm sitting here wondering where Saudi Arabia is, where Kuwait is, where Qatar is,"" Sanders said on CNN's ""New Day."" ""I'll be damned if kids in the state of Vermont -- or taxpayers in the state of Vermont -- have to defend the royal Saudi family, which is worth hundreds of billions of dollars."" Saudi Arabia and Qatar are part of a five-country coalition of Middle Eastern nations that have joined the U.S. in airstrikes against ISIS in Syria, but Sanders suggested the U.S. should only be ""supportive."" Sanders also joined 21 other senators earlier this month in opposing a resolution to train and arm 5,000 moderate Syrian rebels to combat ISIS. ""It cannot be won and it will not be won by the United States alone,"" Sanders said of the war on ISIS. And like a candidate running for office, Sanders, who is not up for reelection this fall, quickly shifted the interview away from whether the Senate should declare war to the plight of the middle class and increasing income inequality. ""While we focus all of our attention on ISIS, the middle class in this country continues to collapse,"" Sanders said. ""And you know what the people tell me in Vermont and around the country? Let's also start paying attention to the crises facing working families in America."" Instead of a war resolution, Sanders rattled off a list of progressive initiatives he does ""want to vote on,"" including raising the minimum wage and creating a national jobs program. Sanders calls for 'political revolution' in Iowa . Sanders traveled to Iowa earlier this month on what he has described as a listening tour to gauge the appetite for what would be a populist campaign for the presidency. ""I'm going around the country getting an assessment from the American people as to whether or not there would be support for a campaign that in fact takes on the Koch brothers, takes on the billionaire class,"" Sanders said.","Sanders doesn't want to see the United States fall into another ""quagmire in the Middle East""

"A key national security adviser to President Barack Obama said he believes the United States will ""absolutely"" secure an international coalition to defeat the rapidly growing terrorist group operating in Iraq and Syria known as ISIS. ""I absolutely do believe that there will be a coalition of countries from the international community, from here in NATO, also from the region where many of the neighbors have stepped up and said they want to be a part of that type of effort,"" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said in an interview Thursday with CNN outside the NATO summit in Wales. ""A lot of these European countries are concerned about the foreign fighters that have gone down to Iraq and Syria who have European passports. So they are very concerned that this threat in Iraq and Syria could end up posing a threat here in Europe,"" Rhodes said. How ISIS flaunts its brutality as propaganda . The President has yet to make a decision to conduct airstrikes in Syria, White House officials cautioned. It is also unclear how an anti-ISIS coalition would take shape. Rhodes suggested participating countries would likely serve in different roles, depending on their capabilities and appetite for a more direct military involvement in the mission. ""Intelligence. Law enforcement. Lots of ways for nations to step up to the plate and be a part of this coalition,"" Rhodes said. NATO leaders tackle packed agenda including ISIS, Ukraine, Afghanistan . In a sense, there is already a coalition assisting the United States in its current limited mission against ISIS in Iraq.  British, French and Australian forces have participated in airdrops of humanitarian supplies to Iraqis and Kurds under assault from ISIS militants. Obama created some confusion about his strategy at a news conference in Estonia earlier this week when he said his goal was to both ""degrade and destroy"" ISIS and reduce the group's threat ""to the point where it is a manageable problem."" Why is ISIS so brutal? Rhodes argued there was no inconsistency in the president's remarks, insisting the mission to defeat ISIS is a multi-step process. ""What the president was saying is this is a phased effort and the first phase is going to have to be pushing back ISIL, getting them out of those strongholds, putting in place the coalition that can then work methodically to destroy the organization,"" Rhodes said. On a conference call with reporters Thursday, Rhodes indicated any decision to conduct airstrikes would occur after Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and a White House counterterrorism adviser travel to the Middle East to gauge support in the region for an anti-ISIS coalition. Inside the mind of an ISIS fighter . But Rhodes told CNN it would be difficult to ultimately destroy ISIS without dealing with the organization in Syria, where it currently enjoys a safe haven.

"Embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad told the United Nations-Arab League envoy on Sunday that countries must stop supporting, arming and providing protection to terrorists -- the government's term for rebels. Lakhdar Brahimi was in Damascus to try to broker a cease-fire before the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, which begins Friday. The president ""stressed that Syria supports the efforts of the U.N. envoy to Syria and is open to any sincere efforts seeking to find a political solution to the crisis based on respecting Syria's sovereignty and rejecting any foreign interference,"" the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported. He ""clarified that any initiative or political process should be essentially based on the principle of halting terrorism and what is required in this regard from the countries involved in supporting, arming and harboring the terrorists in Syria (is) to halt such acts,"" it said. For his part, Brahimi told reporters that he had no agenda other than serving the Syrian people. ""I'll come back after the Eid. If there was calm during it, we would build on it, and even it there wasn't, we would work to realize calm,"" Brahimi said, according to SANA. Given previous experiences, the odds of a cease-fire between Syrian government forces and rebels are stacked against Brahimi. The man he replaced, Kofi Annan, made numerous trips to Damascus and was unable to halt the violence. Opposition activists say more than 30,000 people have been killed since the Syrian crisis began in March 2011. Even as Brahimi and al-Assad met, at least 135 people were killed across the country Sunday, including six children, according to the Local Coordination Committees (LCC) of Syria. Seventy of the deaths were reported in Damascus and its suburbs. The opposition group also reported an ""exchange of intense gunfire"" between a Jordanian border patrol and Syrian security forces. A car bomb went off in the Syrian capital, killing 13 people and wounding 29 on Sunday, SANA said. The report blamed the attack on terrorists. Syrian forces ""continued cleansing neighborhoods in Aleppo and its countryside of terrorists,"" SANA reported.  And an explosive device in a Damascus suburb injured some bystanders, it said, again blaming terrorists.

"(CNN)No. 2 Oregon will square off against No. 4 Ohio State for the national championship on Monday night. But this isn't like any other college football national title game from years' past. This is the first one that will be decided through a playoff system. Here is the what-you-need-to-know information about this game and how the teams got there. 1. This game is historic for college football . For the first time ever, the highest level of college football has a playoff system, something the fans and media have desired for years. This is the first year of the College Football Playoff, a four-team playoff that consists of two national semifinal games and a final. The top four seeds were, in order, Alabama, Oregon, Florida State and Ohio State. The teams were selected by a committee. The College Football Playoff, which replaces the Bowl Championship Series, runs for 12 years through the 2025 season. Despite the change, the bowl-game structure is still in place. No. 2 Oregon routed No. 3 Florida State 59-20 in the Rose Bowl in the first semifinal, while No. 4 Ohio State upset No. 1 Alabama 42-35 in the Sugar Bowl, the second semifinal. Oregon and Ohio State will play for the national championship at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. There is other history to consider. Coincidentally, the first time that men's college basketball had a national championship game, back in 1939, the two teams were Oregon and Ohio State. The Ducks won that game against the Buckeyes, 46-33, on Northwestern's campus in Evanston, Illinois. But with Oregon's super-fast-paced offense -- and Ohio State's ability to go high tempo as well -- there is a chance the football game might have an even higher score. 2. Historic for TV, too . ESPN ponied up $7.3 billion -- that's billion with a ""B"" -- for the rights to broadcast the College Football Playoff for 12 years. It's an investment that already seems to be paying off, as the semifinals set records for cable TV. According to ESPN, 28.2 million viewers tuned in to watch Oregon defeat Florida State in the Rose Bowl. The Sugar Bowl, in which Ohio State shocked Alabama, attracted 28.3 million viewers. Both of those games were the highest-rated shows in cable TV history. Compared to last year, the Sugar Bowl saw a 130 percent ratings' increase, while the Rose Bowl increased by 45 percent. Expect record-breaking numbers for Oregon vs. Ohio State. 3. This game is such a big deal, cities are adjusting their names . At least in Ohio, anyway. The city of Oregon, which is near Toledo, announced it would be known as ""Oregon, Ohio Buckeyes on the Bay, City of Duck Hunters."" The new name is a play on the city's ""Oregon on the Bay, City of Opportunity"" slogan. Additionally, Urbana, Ohio, elected a temporary name change, announcing on Facebook it would drop the ""a"" and become ""Urban"" in support of the Buckeyes and their coach, Urban Meyer. When asked for his reaction, Meyer said, ""Wow. That's very nice."" It doesn't appear that there are any name changes in the works in the state of Oregon, but the fandom at times still borderlines on religious, particularly for the Ducks' star player, Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Marcus Mariota. Earlier this season, a student from O'Hara Catholic School in Eugene informed Oregon head coach Mark Helfrich the talk around the school: ""There's Jesus, there's girls, and there's Marcus Mariota."" Helfrich couldn't help but laugh. ""We've got a poster in the works,"" he joked. 4. Unlikely story: Heisman Trophy winner vs. a third-string quarterback . Talk about different circumstances. Oregon has been hovering around the top of the college rootball rankings all season, led by the quiet and calm Mariota. Aside from an upset loss to Arizona, Oregon has been steady all season with Mariota running the offense. This season, the junior has completed 68.6% of his passes, throwing for 40 touchdowns and just three interceptions. Meanwhile, Ohio State's season looked like it had ended before it even began. Starting quarterback and Heisman candidate Braxton Miller suffered a noncontact shoulder injury in practice in August and was out for the season. With little time to prepare, inexperienced backup quarterback J.T. Barrett took over for the Buckeyes, struggling in an early-season loss at home to then-unranked Virginia Tech in Week 2. At that point, no one put Ohio State in the College Football Playoff conversation. Ultimately, the struggles didn't last, as Barrett ending up flourishing in Ohio State's offense, becoming a Heisman contender himself. However, against rival Michigan -- the Buckeyes' final game before the Big Ten Championship game -- Barrett suffered a broken ankle, ending his season. Again, Ohio State looked to be finished, stuck on the outside of the College Football Playoff top four rankings. Down to barely-used third-string quarterback Cardale Jones, Ohio State stunned the college football world, routing then-No. 13 Wisconsin 59-0 in the Big Ten championship game. It was Jones' first career start. The win catapulted Ohio State into the College Football Playoff. But Jones wasn't done. The sophomore, who is nicknamed ""12 Gauge"" because of his uniform number and arm strength, shocked fans again, leading the Buckeyes to the upset win against Alabama in the semifinals. 5. This matchup never would have happened with the BCS . It's widely assumed that the old system, the BCS, would never have pitted Oregon and Ohio State to play for a national championship. The BCS used human polls, computer rankings, and strength of schedule to match the top two teams in the country to play for the national title, and the process had always been open to criticism. With that formula, Ohio State wouldn't have had a chance, and Oregon's hopes probably would have been slim. It's likely that defending national champion Florida State, who was undefeated in the regular season, would have played Southeastern Conference champion Alabama if the BCS was still in place.","Monday's national championship game first in new playoff system .

"(CNN) -- Too lazy to have a shower? Worry no more, there's a lotion for that. DryBath is a germ-killing gel that allows you to take a bath without using a single drop of water or soap -- all you need is to apply the gel on your skin and then vigorously rub it off using your hands. ""The special formula will cover the whole body with the cleansing gel, which will use the vigorous rubbing to lift the dirt off the skin,"" explains Ludwick Marishane, the inventor of DryBath and founder of Headboy Industries. The 23-year-old entrepreneur came up with his revolutionary idea back in 2007, during a hot winter day when he was relaxing with some friends under the blazing sun in Limpopo, northern South Africa. ""Man, why doesn't somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and you don't have to bathe,"" quipped one of his pals, complaining that he didn't feel like having a shower -- and this got Marishane thinking. Still in high school, Marishane immediately took to Google and Wikipedia to start researching creams and lotions, learning everything about their components and how they are produced. Since he didn't have a computer he carried out his investigations using his mobile phone and a few months later he'd devised his own special formula -- at the age of 17, Marishane became South Africa's youngest patent-filer. Marishane, who won the global student entrepreneur award in 2011, went on to study at the University of Cape Town and soon got his DryBath-producing business running. He says his trademarked invention can be a ""precious tool"" for the millions of people lacking access to clean water and sanitation, as well as an an attractive option for corporate groups -- from airlines and hotels to gyms and even aid agencies -- who want to encourage their clients and users to save water. CNN's African Start-Up caught up with Marishane to speak about DryBath, his plans for the future and why he doesn't shower on the last weekend of September every year. CNN: How would you describe DryBath to someone who's never used it before? Ludwick Marishane: DryBath is a bath-substituting gel, designed to replace the need for soap, water and skin lotion. DryBath provides its users with a fun and convenient alternative to traditional bathing and showering, a precious tool for helping people to lower the excessive water use that is leading to a looming global water crisis. CNN: What are DryBath's ingredients? LM: It is a proprietary blend of cleansers and moisturizers that make it a uniquely viscous blend of bioflavonoids, natural emollients, and fruit acids to cleanse the skin, while preventing dryness, irritation and body odor. CNN: Can you talk about your company's social goals? LM: As it stands, there are almost two billion people in the world without adequate access to water and sanitation, all while people in urban societies consume an average of 80 liters of water every time they bathe/shower. It is our goal for DryBath, and other products like it, to change the way society practices personal hygiene, and to provide cheap personal hygiene alternatives to the poor. We know we cannot do this on our own, and we request any and all help that anyone can provide. The easiest way to provide assistance to our cause is by participating in our annual ""DryBath No-Bathing Weekend"" -- this is our strategy to allow the public to participate in helping us skip one million or more bathes/showers by skipping them for a whole weekend in September. CNN: What are the challenges you've faced so far? LM: The challenge our business has been facing in recent years is pricing; we have constantly been struggling to produce and distribute the product at prices that are affordable for people in water-insecure communities -- ideally less than $0.10 per bathe. As a startup, we have had to create a parallel product (DryBath Premium) for the urban market -- campers/hikers, parents with kids, shared/public-shower users, etc. -- that can be sold at a reasonable margin to allow us to make the original DryBath product affordable. CNN: Which entrepreneurs do you most admire? And what advice would you give to those aspiring to start their own business? LM: I admire the everyday entrepreneurs -- those who sell fruits from their stall at the corner, have a great barbershop/salon, use their car as a taxi cab, etc. They don't do it for any glory or adoration, they just wake up every day to get the job done while still dealing with the risk of not breaking even each month. I urge all aspiring entrepreneurs to have this approach to business, because it's what every great business -- big or small -- succeeds on. READ THIS: Teen turns $14 into paper bag empire .

"(CNN)Chelsea regained their lead at the top of the English Premier League Saturday with a comfortable 2-0 victory over Newcastle United. Coupled with Manchester City's failure to win at Everton, the result means Jose Mourinho's side are now two points clear in first position having been tied level with City at the beginning of the day. Yet although the London club were ultimately triumphant, they didn't have it all their own way at Stamford Bridge. Newcastle had the best of the first half chances, with Remy Cabella being denied by a fine Petr Cech save and Moussa Sissoko striking a post for the visitors. But it was Chelsea who went into the break 1-0 up thanks to Oscar's strike 43rd minute strike. Quick thinking by Willian picked out Branislav Ivanovic at a corner and the Serbian passed on to Oscar to open the scoring. The Brazilian then turned provider on the hour mark, setting up Diego Costa as the Blues took command of the game. It was a control Chelsea would not relinquish against one of only two sides to beat them season. Costa, Eden Hazard and Loic Remy all went close to adding to the margin of victory before referee Roger East called time. ""In the first half, (Newcastle) had some moments when they caused us some problems,"" Chelsea assistant boss Steve Holland told Sky Sports after the match. ""But a much improved performance in the second half (meant) we were good value for the 2-0 win."" If Chelsea were eventually comfortable, City were frustrated at Goodison Park -- a venue they have seldom enjoyed visiting in recent years. Star strikers Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko returned to the City squad after injury, however, it was Montenegro international Stevan Jovetic who started up front for the Sky Blues. With the game finely balanced at 0-0, Argentine international Aguero replaced Jovetic just after the hour mark -- and City were soon in the lead. Brazilian midfielder Fernandinho latched on to David Silva's shot-cum-cross to push the ball beyond Everton goalkeeper Joel Robles. But Manuel Pellegrini's men weren't celebrating for long as Scotland striker Steven Naismith leveled for the home side just three minutes later. City brought on Frank Lampard for the remainder of the match but were unable to find the killer goal that would have kept them level with Chelsea. ""We missed chances in the first half and we didn't make the goalkeeper work which is a bit frustrating, "" said Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart to Sky Sports after the match. ""(But) it's a difficult place historically for us to come ... we're going to take the point and move on."" Premier League roundup . Elsewhere in the Premier League Saturday, there was victory for Tony Pulis in his first official game in charge of West Bromwich Albion. The Baggies defeated Hull City 1-0 thanks to a second half strike from 21-year-old England striker Saido Berahino. Aston Villa's struggles in front of goal continued in the Midlands derby with Leicester City. Paul Konchesky scored the only goal of the game to give bottom of the table Leicester the win. Andy Carroll gave West Ham an early lead away to Swansea City, however, a second half equalizer from Bafetimbi Gomis ensured the game ended 1-1. Meanwhile, Burnley continued their fine run of form by defeating Queens Park Rangers 2-1 at Turf Moor thanks to first half goals from Scott Arfield and Danny Ings. In the day's early game, a solitary goal from Lazar Markovic was enough to give Champions League chasing Liverpool a welcome three points at 10-man Sunderland. The 20-year-old Serb's early strike was his first league goal for Liverpool since moving from Benfica last year.","Chelsea go clear at top of EPL after 2-0 victory over Newcastle United .

"The fortunes of potential U.S. allies among Syrian rebel groups are ebbing fast as hardline Salafist groups and especially al Qaeda's affiliate go on the offensive. The past month has dealt further reverses to already-beleaguered moderate groups, whose presence in the critical northern provinces of Idlib and Aleppo has further eroded. This is a growing headache for the Obama administration, which is trying to identify, train and ""stand up"" moderate rebel factions to take on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Washington has announced a $500 million program to train 5,000 fighters over one year. But it is yet to begin, and some of these groups are now in retreat or on the verge of extinction. Those that aren't are wary of being identified as ""Washington's guys"" because of the administration's focus on degrading ISIS but not going after Syrian government forces. Tough road for moderate groups . Analysts say moderate groups are caught between a rock and a hard place, pilloried by radical factions for taking Western weapons but failing to get enough of them (or quickly enough) to become serious players. Noah Bonsey of the International Crisis Group writes in Foreign Policy, ""For a rebel commander seeking to convince his fighters that cooperation with Washington is in the rebellion's best interest, American strikes that ignore the Assad regime while hitting (Islamist rebels in) Ahrar al-Sham are extremely difficult to explain."" Moderate groups also suffer from poor morale and a lack of resources. All in all, says Kimberly Kagan, president of the Institute for the Study of War, ""the forces that the U.S. has nominally been backing have suffered losses at the hands of the Islamic State, Jabhat al-Nusra (al Qaeda's Syrian franchise) and the regime."" The current trajectory, she says, means ""the moderate opposition remains marginal and incapable of shaping the battlefield in any material way."" Bonsey said coalition airstrikes against ISIS had allowed President Bashar al-Assad to refocus on hitting mainstream rebels, and the regime had made gains around Hama and Aleppo. Combined with al-Nusra's advances in Idlib and the threat of a renewed offensive by ISIS, moderate groups were now in danger of a rapid decline. Kristen Gillespie, founder of the website Syria Direct, agrees: ""American policy freed up the regime to step up bombings of its own civilians, which we are seeing in areas across Syria such as Jobar, Hama and Homs."" Al-Nusra appears to have benefited from the limited strikes against its subsidiary, the Khorasan Group, which the U.S. alleges is planning attacks on the West. Observers say the strikes, and reports of civilian casualties, have gained the group sympathy and support. Making things still worse, there appears to be at least a truce between al-Nusra and ISIS, allowing each to focus on other enemies, whether moderate groups, the regime or the Kurds, and consolidate control over their respective strongholds. The U.S. director of national intelligence, James Clapper, last month spoke of ""tactical accommodations"" between the two groups. Other sources say smaller Salafist groups that share the jihadist outlook of al-Nusra and ISIS have helped broker local agreements. An al-Nusra spokesman, Abu Azzam al-Ansari, told Syria Direct last month that al-Nusra is looking for a cease-fire, though not a larger merger with ISIS, because it wants to focus on fighting ""just the Alawites (regime)."" Such a truce may allow al-Nusra free rein in the northwest of Syria, while ISIS focuses on its heartland in the northeast. In the past month, it has overwhelmed forces of the Syrian Revolutionaries' Front and Harakat Hazm in Idlib, both supported by the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. The Revolutionaries' Front had been seen as a potential U.S. ally since it helped expel ISIS fighters from the region in January. Dozens of Harakat Hazm fighters defected to al-Nusra, according to local activists. Al-Nusra fighters are within a few kilometers of border crossings into Turkey, a source of revenue and resupply.  Local activists and analysts also see al-Nusra developing a closer relationship with the most powerful group within the Islamic Front: Ahrar al-Sham. Gillespie says Ahrar is popular in Idlib as many of its members are from the province. ""They have the popularity; Nusra has more of the military might,"" she says. Together, ""they appear to be a formidable foe for anyone looking to take over Idlib."" Al-Nusra's propaganda machine has showcased the social services it is providing and its convoys parading through Idlib. To some analysts, al-Nusra appears to be emulating ISIS in building its own emirate in northern Syria. In a recording leaked in July, al-Nusra's leader, Abu Muhammad al-Julani, was heard saying the time had come to establish ""an Islamic emirate in the Levant."" Bonsey says it has ""withdrawn assets from key fronts with the regime and shifted them to establish unilateral control of other areas."" Al-Nusra has begun implementing sharia law and building local government, releasing images of its Da'wah (Islamic preaching) offices in the town of Sarmada and elsewhere. But Gillespie says ""they are moving slowly, because people still fear Nusra is a version of ISIS. Nusra is launching campaigns to create gardens, pick up trash and other measures that improve people's quality of life."" Even so, other factions are apprehensive that it's on the way to emulating ISIS and building its own caliphate, says Bonsey. Stark choice . In neighboring Aleppo province, an area the al-Assad regime has fought hard to control, the battlefield is even more complex. After Damascus, the city of Aleppo remains the most important theater for both the regime and its opponents. Western reporters who have managed to get into Aleppo say the Islamic Front -- an umbrella group of Islamist militia -- is in control of rebel-held neighborhoods, while al-Nusra dominates in the countryside to the north. Al-Nusra and its allies are engaged in a bitter battle against the regime and fighters of the Lebanese militia Hezbollah for control of two nearby towns -- Zahra and Nubul -- inhabited largely by pro-regime Shiites. Videos and photographs uploaded in recent days suggest a sustained assault against Zahra and Nubul: In one instance, al-Nusra appears to have used a captured armored troop carrier as a massive suicide bomb. Success against the regime in these towns would secure a vital supply route for rebels clinging on in Aleppo in the face of aerial and artillery bombardment, but for now ,the towns' defenders are holding out. Al-Nusra is clearly taking territory while it can, perhaps wary of ISIS suddenly turning on it (as it did in August) or the emergence of better-equipped groups supported by the West. As the regime and rebels fight to a standstill around Aleppo, ISIS waits in the wings, looking for an opportunity to take further territory (if not the city itself) from exhausted combatants. ISIS holds rural areas near the town of Marea, 20 miles north of Aleppo. Among the groups lined up against it are fighters of the Jaish al Mujahideen, a mainstream outfit that has U.S. support and claims to have about 6,000 fighters. But one of the group's commanders, Abdulaziz, told Reuters this week  that only 50 men have received training in a CIA-sponsored program. They would be hard-pressed to resist a renewed ISIS assault in the area. Ultimately, Bonsey says, ""to reverse jihadist gains, you need to strengthen moderate groups and get as many of them as possible on the same page."" The creation last week of the Revolutionary Command Council, which includes a wide spectrum of rebel groups, could be significant -- if it survives and so long as it doesn't become just a vehicle for Salafist factions such as Ahrar al-Sham. So far, says Bonsey, ""the bottom line is that the pace and scale of U.S. support is not sufficient to halt, let alone reverse, the erosion of moderate forces."" Most territory in Syria is essentially shared by the ""big three"": ISIS, al-Nusra and its allies, and the regime. ""The Americans have painted themselves into a corner, left to work only with so-called moderates, who at this point have mostly been kidnapped, killed, exiled or absorbed into Islamist factions,"" says Gillespie.

"(CNN) -- I have always been a fiercely independent woman. I learned from my grandmother -- the breadwinner in her marriage -- that there was nothing that a woman couldn't do as well as a man. I started working when I was 16 years old and, by all accounts, I had achieved a fairly high degree of success as a young journalist in my early 20s. A die-hard feminist, my desire for self-sufficiency didn't stem from a movement: It was personal. A child of divorced parents who always fought about money-related issues, and with my grandmother's words etched in my mind, I told myself at a young age that I would never rely on a man or anyone to take care of me. I became so defiant about being able to do things on my own that I would rarely even let people buy me meals. That still holds true today. Then, I met ""Tom,"" who was much older and more successful than me. We started dating in my early 30s at a time when my career had me traveling all over the world to report stories. I was neither looking for a relationship nor cared to be in one. A lot of my friends, however, were beginning to settle down and I started to feel like something was wrong with me for not being able to even fathom doing the same. That's not to say I wasn't happy with where I was: I loved my work and I loved the woman I had become. Tom was a nice man who seemed to take a liking to me quite quickly. Like many men of similar ilk, Tom could be aggressive about acquiring things he wanted. Before I knew it, I was being sucked into his vortex. One week we'd be cruising the Mediterranean in a massive full-service yacht, the next we'd be on a shopping excursion in Rome. It all happened so fast and I was being exposed to a part of the world that -- despite being well-traveled -- I had never experienced. It started to become glaringly apparent that I was being seduced by a lifestyle. I was becoming a sugar baby. Or at least, that's how I felt. College 'sugar babies' date for cash . We all know what sugar daddies are: Wealthy older men have throughout history sought out much younger women -- ""sugar babies"" -- to date, even marry and take care of. Despite the women's liberation movement, our culture is always reminding us of gender roles. Today, websites like SeekingArrangement.com are making it that much easier for men and women to connect by waving the carrot of support and financial security to attract youth and beauty. SeekingArrangement.com CEO says love doesn't exist . While I think Tom liked me because of my independent spirit, I'm quite sure he hoped that the longer we were in a relationship together, the more likely it would be that I would eventually give up my career and let him support me. He was not at all a bad person, but increasingly, I was starting to feel owned and that I was losing myself. Now there's nothing wrong with being in a relationship in which one person financially supports the other. We all contribute to our relationships in different ways and in no way should any contribution be trivialized. I just knew that I was in mine for the wrong reasons and that I had compromised the woman I had worked so hard to become. I am now married and have a child with a man who is quite successful in his own right. I know that if I fall onto hard times, he'll support me, and I will do the same. Even though we're equal partners in our marriage, it's important for me to maintain my own identity, career and finances. ""No matter what,"" my grandma always said, ""have your own money."" In a span of a lifetime, my relationship with Tom was a mere blip. But, it serves as a constant reminder of a time when I didn't recognize myself, and that didn't feel very good.","Lisa Ling describes herself as ""fiercely independent"" and ""a die-hard feminist""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Aid started flowing into Haiti Wednesday in the wake of the earthquake that slammed the impoverished nation late Tuesday afternoon. One of two military cargo planes carrying a 30-man assessment team arrived at Port-au-Prince airport Wednesday evening to assess Haiti's needs. One of the team's first jobs is to get the airport working to a point where it can handle flights from around the world filled with people and supplies to help the victims of the quake. In addition, a unit of U.S. Air Force Special Operations Forces left Hurlburt Field in Florida, with the unit including airmen, search-and-rescue experts and equipment to set up temporary air traffic control systems. A Canadian military plane was to depart Trenton, Ontario, laden with supplies at 2 a.m. Thursday. But the air space was not open to charitable organizations, said Franklin Graham, president of Samaritan's purse, which was planning to send charter planes loaded with supplies to Haiti Thursday morning. ""I hope and pray that they will open that air space first thing in the morning,"" he told CNN. U.S. Embassy staff at the Port-au-Prince airport said the tower and the lights were working, U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said; a CNN producer said the windows in the tower were broken. As the scope of the disaster began to come into focus, offers of help began pouring in. Crowley said the Netherlands, Iceland, Puerto Rico, Guyana, Brazil, Canada, Belize, Cuba, Morocco and France all had offered aid. Impact Your World: How you can help . The World Bank promised $100 million in emergency funds for recovery and reconstruction, subject to approval by the World Bank's board of directors. World Health Organization personnel were planning to depart Thursday morning for Haiti, where their priority was to identify hospitals functional enough to treat the injured and coordinating the international health response. After relief organizations found themselves tripping over one another following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, they decided to coordinate their efforts with those of non-U.N. organizations in what is called the ""U.N. Cluster System."" In the system, WHO plays the lead coordinating role for health; the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees or the Red Cross does it for shelter; and the World Food Programme does it for food, according to Christy Feig, WHO's director of communications. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, who in 1975 honeymooned in Haiti with the current secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, urged listeners to donate to http://www.clintonfoundation.org/haitiearthquake/. ""Anybody who sends us money, we're just going to move it into those supplies quickly,"" he promised. He urged world leaders who have already made a commitment at a Clinton Foundation donors' conference to check to see whether they had fulfilled it. ""Most countries are way behind on fulfilling it,"" he said. ""They (Haitians) need your help now."" He said that, after the 2004 Asian tsunami, Americans donated more than $1 billion, with a median contribution of $56, and half of the money came via the Internet. ""Little donations can add up to big amounts,"" he said. ""Five or ten dollars can make a huge difference. These people are just like you and they're hurting now."" Search-and-rescue teams from cities in the United States headed to Haiti, with a team from Fairfax, Virginia, due to arrive Wednesday in Port-au-Prince, the State Department said. The U.S. Agency for International Development was expected to have an emergency response team on the ground Wednesday, Crowley said. The United States was also sending aid by ship, and the crew of the USNS Comfort has been ordered to report to the Navy hospital ship. The ship was expected to leave port in Baltimore within five days of receiving its orders, but it had not yet been ordered to deploy, Capt. John Kirby told CNN. It would take about five days to get to Haiti. The 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck southern Haiti late Tuesday afternoon, knocking down buildings and inflicting destruction and casualties yet to be tallied, given limited communications and emergency services in the Caribbean nation. Many other countries have also offered assistance: . • Brazil's Ministry of Defense ordered its troops in the country to offer whatever assistance they can, Brazil's official news agency reported. The South American nation has 1,266 troops -- including 250 in an engineering unit -- in Haiti as part of a United Nations stabilization force. • China was preparing to send a 50-member rescue team, including three sniffer dogs, the official news agency Xinhua reported. China has 125 peace-keeping police in Haiti, but no diplomatic ties with the country, Xinhua reported. • Spain was sending three planeloads of aid -- two from Panama in Central America and one from Madrid, the Spanish capital, CNN affiliate CNN+ reported. Spain was also making 3 million euros ($4.35 million) available for aid and will coordinate the European Union response. • France, Haiti's former colonial ruler, dispatched two planeloads of rescue personnel, one from Guadeloupe in the Caribbean and one from Marseilles, France. • Russia was sending a mobile hospital with a staff of 45, including 20 doctors, Emergency Situations Ministry spokeswoman Elena Chernova told CNN. The mobile hospital ""has intensive therapy, surgery, diagnostics, ultra-sound, X-ray, electrocardiogram modules as well as a blood test laboratory,"" and can accommodate 50 patients at a time, she said. • Cuba sent an additional 30 doctors, plus medical supplies, to join the 344 doctors and paramedics it already had working throughout Haiti on humanitarian missions, said Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez. • Iceland was sending a 37-man search-and-rescue team and offered to help evacuate foreign nationals, its foreign ministry said. • Canada had a five-man team already in Haiti as part of the U.N. relief efforts there. All five were helping with the relief effort, Capt. Elizabeth Tremblay told CNN. • The United Kingdom and Israel also pledged to send survey teams. • Under a U.S. State Department program, individuals with U.S. cell phones can donate $10 to the Red Cross by texting ""Haiti"" to 90999. The State Department said Wednesday afternoon that the campaign had received nearly 83,000 hits. • Musician Wyclef Jean's Yele foundation is accepting $5 donations for texting the word ""Yele"" to 501501. Text the word ""Haiti"" to 25383 to donate $5 to the Internal Rescue Committee. The donations will appear on mobile phone bills, in addition to any charges for texting and data. • The Jolie-Pitt Foundation donated $1 Million to Doctors Without Borders for operations in Haiti. ""It is incredibly horrible to see a catastrophe of this size hit a people who have been suffering from extreme poverty, violence and unrest for so many decades,"" said Angelina Jolie in a news release. The group, also called Medecins Sans Frontieres, said its medical teams have treated more than 1,000 people since the earthquake hit. Prior to the earthquake, its 800 staff members ran three hospitals in Port-au-Prince, but they were all badly damaged. Its teams have been operating out of open-air hospitals since Tuesday afternoon. The group was focusing on re-establishing surgical capacity to deal with crushed limbs and head wounds, said Paul McPhun, an emergency management expert for the organization, also known as Doctors Without Borders. • The United Nations was releasing $10 million from its Central Emergency Relief Fund (CERF), Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said. It was also mobilizing an emergency response team to coordinate relief efforts. • The American Red Cross promised $1 million in aid and said it was releasing enough supplies -- tarps, mosquito nets and cooking sets -- from its warehouse in Panama to meet the immediate needs of 5,000 families. • Islamic Relief USA, which describes itself as America's largest Muslim relief organization, announced it would fly $1 million in aid to Haiti in coordination with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. • The World Food Programme was airlifting 86 metric tons of food from its hub in El Salvador, enough for more than half a million meals, the agency said. The aid included ready-to-eat food and high-energy biscuits. • AmeriCares was sending $3 million in medical aid, including antibiotics, pain relievers, bandages and other supplies, plus relief workers to distribute the aid. It was also releasing 10,000 pounds of emergency relief and pledging $5 million in aid. • The U.S. Fund for UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, said it had released $500,000 to assist the efforts of the 10 international staff and 34 national staff in its Port-au-Prince office. In Jacmel, southwest of the capital, thousands of people have sought shelter in camps set up by the government, UNICEF relief worker Guido Cornale told CNN. UNICEF is providing clean drinking water to the victims and has distributed 2,500 kitchen kits that can be used to set up kitchens in the camps. At least 1,000 people were to be fed a hot meal Wednesday night, Cornale said. • The United Nations Foundation committed $1 million to address the most urgent humanitarian and re-construction needs in Haiti, UNF Founder Ted Turner said in a statement. Turner founded CNN but is no longer associated with the network. • The World Health Organization was sending a 12-person team to Haiti to help with the medical response. • The International Rescue Committee was deploying its Emergency Response Team, focusing on critical medical, water and sanitation. • The Salvation Army was preparing to send a team from Florida that would include emergency disaster services personnel, including Haitian Salvation Army officers who speak Creole. The organization has more than 60 church/community centers on the island, it said. • Catholic Relief Services had 340 staff members already in Haiti, and pre-positioned supplies in the country. The group said it would also send staff members from its home office in Baltimore, Maryland, to the neighboring Dominican Republic. • National Nurses United issued an urgent call for registered nurse volunteers to provide assistance. • The International Monetary Fund was planning to ""coordinate with other international agencies, and mobilize our assistance as quickly as possible,"" Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said in a statement. • Businesses pledging relief in amounts exceeding $500,000 included UPS, Google, Coca Cola, Lowe's, Bank of America Charitable Foundation, Wal-Mart and ConAgra Foods Foundation. The quake, centered about 15 kilometers (10 miles) southwest of Port-au-Prince, struck shortly before 5 p.m. Tuesday. Roads in Haiti were unsafe because of a lack of lighting and because many buildings had collapsed into the roads or were threatening to do so, said Ian Rodgers of the relief organization Save the Children. CNN's Elise Labott, Adam S. Levine, Shasta Darlington, Tom Watkins, Maxim Tkachenko, Per Nyberg, Edvige Jean-Francois, Deb Feyerick, Matt Smith, Mike Mount, Larry Shaughnessy, Khadijah Rentas and Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.","NEW: Aid, search-and-rescue experts begin to reach Haiti .

"They were TV stars, in a sense, having appeared on the National Geographic Channel's reality show, ""Alaska State Troopers."" But more than that, Patrick ""Scott"" Johnson and Gabriel ""Gabe"" Rich were family men and men of the law. Neither got the happy Hollywood ending they deserved, instead dying in a confrontation in a sparse, remote sliver of Alaska. The troopers' bodies were recovered from Tanana, a village 130 miles west of Fairbanks, on Friday, a day after they were reported killed, the Alaska Department of Public Safety said. Two men have been taken into custody since the incident near the Yukon River in the state's interior. One of them --19-year-old Nathanial Lee Kangas of Tanana -- is under arrest in both deaths, the state public safety department said, adding that  formal murder charges are being prepared. The other is Arvin Morse Kangas, 58, accused of fourth-degree assault and driving with a revoked license in a separate incident. Neither could be immediately reached for comment. In a post Friday on their Facebook page, the Alaska State Troopers said they are ""reeling from the loss"" of their slain colleagues, both of whom worked out of the agency's Fairbanks rural service unit. Born in Fairbanks, Johnson worked three years for the North Slope Borough Police before becoming an Alaska State Trooper in 1993. Here, he held several roles including trooper, field training officer, canine officer, narcotics team supervisor and rural unit sergeant. It's in the latter job that the 45-year-old died, leaving behind a wife and three daughters, according to the Alaska State Troopers. Rich moved to Fairbanks shortly after being born in Pennsylvania, then went on to work for the North Pole Police and, starting in 2011, with the Alaska State Troopers. The 26-year-old is survived by his fiancee and two sons. Commenters on the police Facebook page offered personal remembrances of the two men, commending them as being good at their jobs and good people, generally. ""Bless these two brave troopers,"" one woman wrote. ""RIP."" Both gained a degree of widespread recognition thanks to their appearance on the National Geographic Channel's ""Alaska State Troopers,"" a reality show that the network says follows ""one of the toughest law enforcement agencies in the nation."" Rich appeared in six episodes of ""Alaska State Troopers"" in 2012 and 2013,  according to IMDb.com. Johnson was in four episodes from 2011 to 2013, according to the site. The troopers were not with a film crew when they died and are not slated for any future episodes, said National Geographic Channel spokesman Chris Albert said. The channel has pulled repeats of episodes featuring the slain troopers, he said. ""We have a long and proud association with the troopers, and consider them a member of our extended channel family,"" Albert said in a statement. ""We send our deepest condolences to their families and the entire Alaska State Trooper force."" Newspaper: Troopers shot after botched sale of couch . CNN affiliate KTVF reported that the officers had headed to the village to follow up on a report from the previous night of someone brandishing a gun. The Alaska Dispatch website reported that the troopers were shot after an unarmed village public safety officer called for backup after an altercation involving the botched sale of a $150 couch. The news site said two people had been arrested, one after a lengthy standoff with heavily armed police. Video from CNN affiliate KTUU showed heavily armed authorities -- some of them wearing camouflage -- walking along a dirt road in Tanana, as well as one man being led away in handcuffs. Gov. Sean Parnell mourned the loss of the two officers. ""These fallen heroes answered the call to serve and protect, and made the ultimate sacrifice, while keeping our communities safe,"" the governor said in a statement.  ""May God and the loving support of grateful Alaskans bring comfort to the families of these courageous men."" According the the U.S. Census Bureau, 254 people live in Tanana. The village is located near the confluence of the Tanana and Yukon rivers in Alaska's vast rural interior. No roads lead into the village, which is accessible only by air. Images of the village published online show a town of log-cabin buildings and ramshackle structures along the banks of the Yukon River. The village boomed in the late 1800s and early 1900s with the discovery of gold in the region.","""Bless these two brave troopers,"" a woman writes of the two officers .

"The speaker in an audio message posted Thursday on an ISIS social media account claims to be leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. He is heard saying the U.S.-led coalition to destroy ISIS is ""terrified, weak and powerless."" CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the online message or when it was recorded. The 17-minute audio says the coalition's effort has been a ""failure"" and the coalition will be ""forced"" to ""send ground forces to their deaths and destruction."" The speaker also urges Islamic State fighters to take their battle everywhere and ""light the Earth with fire upon all tyrants,"" and mentions U.S. President Barack Obama's plan to deploy 1,500 additional U.S. troops to Iraq ""under the claim they are advisers."" Laith Alkhouri, a senior analyst at Flashpoint Partners, a U.S. outfit that tracks jihadist websites, said analysts believe the audio is authentic. It was ""issued on the top-tier Islamic State web forum and other top jihadi web forums,"" Alkhouri said. ""It was posted by the handle of the Islamic State's official media correspondent. Al-Baghdadi's voice is clearly heard in the audio."" There were reports last weekend that al-Baghdadi might have been hit in airstrikes, but it was not clear where he was in Iraq or whether he was wounded. Experts said that ISIS has a clear line of succession and someone would take al-Baghdadi's place in the radical Sunni group if he was incapacitated or out of the picture entirely. More than 40 nations have joined the global coalition to battle ISIS. The U.S. has conducted an air campaign against the militant group while Kurdish and Iraqi forces have fought on the ground. Obama has asked his national security team to again review the nation's policy toward Syria. It might not be possible to get rid of ISIS while Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is still in power, senior U.S. officials and diplomats told CNN this week. A pledge to keep fighting . Little is known about al-Baghdadi. He formed his own militant group in the Samarra and Diyala areas of Iraq, where his family is from, and then joined al Qaeda in Iraq. He served four years in a U.S. prison camp for insurgents during the Iraq War. Who is al-Baghdadi? The voice that's purportedly al-Baghdadi says that ISIS fighters will wage war for as long as they have to. ""Even if only one soldier of them remained, they will never abandon fighting, because they defy humiliation and injustice,"" the voice says. ""They will never abandon fighting, because they did not taste honor and dignity except by fighting. They will never abandon fighting. Indeed, they are triumphant. They will be triumphant even if only one man of them is left. They are triumphant and upon certainty of Allah's support for them."" The voice also says he has good news -- ISIS is expanding into Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Egypt, Libya and Algeria. The posting comes on the same day that ISIS announced on social media that its ""treasury department"" will begin minting its own currency in gold, silver and copper. A statement from the military group said that al-Baghdadi directed the creation of the currently to avoid the ""tyrants' financial system.""

"ISIS fighters entered the besieged Syrian Kurdish city of Kobani, a Kurdish fighter said Friday, setting the stage for a vicious street-to-street battle in the shadow of Turkey's border. Alan Minbic, a fighter with the Kurdish People's Protection Unit, or YPG, told CNN that ISIS now controls the southwest corner of the city, known in Arabic as Ayn al-Arab. However, there were conflicting reports. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group, said it did not believe that ISIS was in the city itself based on information from more than a dozen sources in Kobani. On Friday, ISIS released a short video showing the apparent beheading of British aid worker Alan Henning. In the same video, the group threatens the life of another hostage, American aid worker Peter Kassig. In the same video, the terror group threatened the life of an American aid worker. Since August, ISIS has beheaded American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and British aid worker David Haines. If ISIS, also known as ISIL and the Islamic State, takes Kobani, it will control a complete swath of land from its self-declared capital of Raqqa, Syria, on the Euphrates River to the Turkish border, more than 60 miles away. Thousands of civilians have fled the predominantly Kurdish city in northern Syria in recent days as ISIS forces apparently have advanced inexorably toward it. The Sunni extremist group's reported entry into the city comes a day after Turkish lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to authorize military force against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Australia decided hours later to join the U.S.-led air campaign against ISIS in Iraq. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu vowed to help the Kurdish fighters defend Kobani from ISIS. ""We wouldn't want Kobani to fall,"" he said. ""We welcomed our brothers who came from Kobani. We'll do whatever we can to prevent this from happening."" For months, ISIS has been advancing, capturing portions of northern and eastern Syria and western and northern Iraq for what it says is its new Islamic state, or caliphate. The fighting has only intensified in the region in recent days, with ISIS nearly surrounding Kobani, not far from Turkey's border. Remaining civilians were ordered Thursday to evacuate and headed to the border, as Kurdish fighters declared their readiness to take on the ISIS militants in street warfare. Snipers take aim . YPG fighters are now using snipers in an effort to prevent the ISIS militants from advancing farther, Minbic said. On the eastern edge of Kobani, city defenders destroyed an ISIS tank, Minbic said, but on the western side, ISIS now controls an area called Tal Shair, which includes an informal border crossing. Mousa Al Ahmad, a Free Syrian Army fighter in Kobani, gave CNN the same information on the ISIS advance into the southwest of the city, in a separate phone conversation. He said there were about 300 FSA fighters battling alongside the YPG in the city. A CNN team nearby could hear bursts of small arms fire -- suggesting close-quarters fighting -- that appeared to be coming from around the southwest part of the city. A sustained bombardment by ISIS rained down, particularly on the eastern side of Kobani, perhaps the heaviest seen in days. People still in the city told CNN they expected ISIS to enter soon and were ready for bloody street-to-street fighting. They believed they would have the upper hand, at least to start with, because they know the city. One Kurdish fighter, who gave only his first name, Botan, told CNN on Thursday that they were not afraid to die if necessary. ""We know what will happen if ISIS takes over our town and what they will do to us,"" he said. ""Our fight is not just for the Kurds, it is a fight for all of humanity. When people are getting their heads chopped off and tossed aside like animals, it is a duty to fight."" Big shift for Turkey . The mood of Turkey's leaders changed in recent days, with ISIS on the nation's doorstep and tens of thousands of people fleeing across its border. The Turkish Parliament voted 298-98 to not only to let the country's military leave its borders to go after ISIS and other terror groups, but also to allow foreign troops to launch operations from Turkey. The authorization, which came as ISIS fighters laid siege to towns just south of the Turkish border, takes effect Saturday. It is a big shift for Turkey, a NATO member, which until now offered only tacit support to the U.S.-led coalition of about 40 nations going after ISIS in Iraq and Syria in various capacities. The Prime Minister submitted a motion declaring that Turkey was seriously threatened by the chaos in Syria and Iraq. On Friday, Syria accused Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of turning his country ""into a springboard of aggression against Syria under the false claim of fighting terrorism and protecting Turkey's national security,"" according to letters from the Foreign and Expatriates Ministry to the United Nations, Syrian state news agency SANA reported. The ministry said Turkey was responsible for ""every single drop of blood that has been shed in Syria"" because it provided political, military and logistical support to terrorist organizations and was a conduit for militants traveling to Syria. U.S. airstrikes have been directed against ISIS positions in the Kobani area this week. But U.S. Central Command said there were no further strikes in the area overnight into Friday. In a statement, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest praised the decisions by Turkey, Australia and Denmark to authorize military force against ISIS. ""We will continue to work with our international partners to expand our sustained and comprehensive approach to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL through a variety of means, including military actions, efforts to stop terrorist financing, countering flows of foreign fighters into the region, and delegitimizing ISIL's extremist ideology,"" the statement said. CNN military analyst Lt. Col. Rick Francona told CNN on Thursday that as the ISIS militants get closer to the city, targeting becomes much more difficult. While Kobani residents were ordered to evacuate, many have refused. This means civilian casualties are probably also a concern, he said. Special forces . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, speaking Friday after the Cabinet's decision to authorize airstrikes and the deployment of special forces in Iraq, said ISIS had ""effectively declared war on the world"" and posed a threat to Australia and its people. ISIS must be disrupted and degraded, he said, and ""it is absolutely in Australia's national interests that this mission go ahead."" The Cabinet authorized the deployment of Australian special forces into Iraq to ""advise and assist"" Iraqi forces, Abbott said, subject to final legal approvals from Iraq. Australian aircraft began flying support missions over Iraq this week. Abbott warned that the deployment to Iraq could be ""quite lengthy,"" lasting months rather than weeks, but that it would be no longer than strictly necessary. ""Yes, it is a combat deployment, but it is an essentially humanitarian mission to protect the people of Iraq and ultimately the people of Australia from the murderous rage of the ISIL death cult,"" he said. Abbott said Australia's special forces would support Iraqi forces, in a way similar to those sent by the United States, which already has ""quite a substantial special forces component on the ground,"" he said. Australia has six Super Hornet strike fighters based in the United Arab Emirates, and Parliament has authorized the use of up to eight, said Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin. Australian authorities believe that there are at least 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East with terrorist groups, chiefly ISIS, and that at least 100 more support terrorist groups through funding and recruitment. Counterterrorism police have carried out raids in Australia in recent days. On Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper presented a motion before the House of Commons about the possibility of his nation taking part in military operations against ISIS in Iraq, including airstrikes. The lower house of Parliament is debating the issue. Retired U.S. Gen. John Allen, who is coordinating the international effort against ISIS, said that he expects a campaign against Mosul within a year. ""Mosul is going to be a pretty important battle,"" he said. ""This was the place where [ISIS leader] Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi exposed himself, it's the place where the difficulties of the ISF [Iraq Security Forces] began to cascade. ... I would say Mosul will go as an operation within a year."" Allen also said ISIS's financial structure must be attacked. ""A single round of air strikes will not defeat the enemy,"" he said. ""[ISIS] operates in the financial space, and generates a lot of revenue, and while the counterattack against ISIS in the physical space is underway, there is going to be a concerted effort in the financial space also to try to deny it the revenue it generates every day, that gives it the oxygen it breathes. ..."" A father's plea . The father of British ISIS hostage John Cantlie, a journalist captured nearly two years ago, said he felt ""great relief"" when his son appeared in a video message showing he was still alive recently, along with a ""feeling of despair and helplessness."" ""I want John to know how very proud I am of him,"" Paul Cantlie said in a video message delivered from a hospital bed. ""I can think of no greater joy than seeing my dear son released and allowed to return home to those that love him."" Cantlie is the latest hostage to be paraded out by ISIS and forced to deliver the group's propaganda. In a video released Thursday, Cantlie -- wearing an orange shirt and seated alone at a desk with a black backdrop -- said he is sending what will be the first in a series of messages on behalf of the group. Cantlie, a photojournalist who also wrote several articles for major British newspapers, was kidnapped in November 2012 along with American journalist James Foley. ISIS released a video of Foley's beheading last month. This month, the group released videos showing the slayings of two other Western hostages, American journalist Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines. In his video message to ISIS, Paul Cantlie, 81, said: ""To those holding John -- please know that he is a good man, he sought only to help the Syrian people and I ask you, from all that is sacred, to help us and allow him to return home.""","Small arms fire can be heard from southwest Kobani, as east is bombarded .

"(CNN)When two fighter jets met in midair over Kansas last year, it turned one to wreckage and clipped a wing off the other, destroying $22 million in government property. But the accident neither killed nor injured anyone seriously. The F-16Cs assigned to the Tulsa Air National Guard collided during a training mission near Moline on October 20, 2014, during an air combat maneuver training mission. The U.S. Air Force released a report on the crash on Friday. One of the pilots ""was an instructor with approximately 2,400 hours of flight time in the F-16,"" while the other was ""a relatively inexperienced student pilot with 106 flying hours in the F-16."" The instructor ejected and experienced minor injuries, while his plane came down in a field. The student pilot's plane had ""significant damage to the right wing,"" but he was able to land at Tulsa International Airport in Oklahoma. Pictures released by the U.S. Air Force show one jet lying in pieces in a field, while the other jet was parked in a hangar with half the right wing missing and damaged parts lying on the floor. The report said that private property was not significantly damaged. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.","The two F-16Cs collided mid-air near Moline, Kansas, in October .

"(CNN)Nigerian troops retook the strategic northeastern town of Baga -- where hundreds were viciously killed in a Boko Haram attack last month -- on Saturday, the West African nation's top military spokesman said. In a statement, Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade said that ""a large number of terrorists ... drowned"" in Lake Chad and others were killed in the fighting to take the fishing town. Lake Chad touches four countries -- Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Cameroon -- all of which have been targeted in recent weeks by Boko Haram, the Islamist extremist group blamed for ongoing horrific attacks, abductions and other abuses. According to Olukolade, Nigerian troops entered Baga early Saturday morning and, hours later, moved into a ""comprehensive ... search phase (to) mop up arms and ammunition and also apprehend any terrorist who might be hiding in the vicinity."" The operation in Baga was one of about a dozen being carried out in the region, all part of a Nigerian offensive aimed at ultimately crushing the terrorist group. ""The troops are now dominating and conducting aggressive patrols...,"" Olukolade said. ""The morale of troops remain high."" Boko Haram's stated goal is to bring its extreme, twisted version of Sharia law to the masses. In the process, it's brought terror -- attacking churches and mosques, bombing crowded markets and raiding once peaceful villages, even kidnapping people young and old, most famously the more than 200 girls taken last April from a school in Chibok. And given its location along Lake Chad in Borno State, about 110 miles north of the state capital of Maiduguri, Baga has frequently found itself in the middle of this violence. This reached a bloody crescendo in early January, when Boko Haram stormed Baga and surrounding towns in what Amnesty International said ""could be Boko Haram's deadliest act."" The Islamist militants sprayed bullets as they stormed the area in trucks and armored vehicles, according to local authorities. Some stopped only to hop onto motorcycles and chase residents who had fled into the bush, firing indiscriminately, said Baba Abba Hassan, a local district head . Local officials reported death tolls ranging from hundreds to as many as 2,000 people. ""Dead bodies litter the bushes in the area and it is still no‎t safe to go and pick them (up) for burial,"" Musa Bukar, the chairman of the local government where Baga is located, said then. ""Some people who hid in their homes were burned alive."" CNN's Christian Purefoy and journalist Aminu Abubakar, as well as Faith Karimi in Atlanta contributed to this report.","Spokesman: Nigerian troops are ""dominating,"" their morale is high .

"(CNN)You're likely to sweat a little to get to some of the best waterfalls. But they deliver a cool refuge and a powerful reminder of nature's force. The United States' waterfalls splash through national parks and preserves and are tucked away in state parks known only to nearby residents. Waterfall lovers will travel thousands of miles and hike or bike to see these prime examples of nature in action. Here are 10 stunning waterfalls across the country that are well worth the effort. 50 states, 50 spots: Natural wonders . Havasu FallsGrand Canyon, Arizona . Those who brave the Arizona heat to visit Havasu Falls are rewarded with refreshing natural swimming pools. Year-round water temperatures stay near a comfortable 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The falls are at the bottom of Havasu Canyon on the Havasupai Indian Reservation adjacent to Grand Canyon National Park. Havasupai means ""people of the blue-green waters,"" and the name doesn't disappoint when it comes to the aquamarine pools at the base of the falls. The village and falls are only accessible by hiking or horseback. It's a 10-mile trip from the trailhead to the falls, which are about two miles beyond Supai Village. Hiking conditions are excellent in the earlier spring and later fall, with moderate temperatures. The area that includes the waterfall is managed by the tribe, which limits the number of visitors. One of the most beautiful and popular spots in the area, reservations are recommended. Triple FallsWestern Gorge, Oregon . High in the Multnomah Falls area of the Columbia River Gorge in Western Gorge, Oregon, is the aptly named Triple Falls. The Oneonta Creek that runs through the gorge splits into three channels, which make their way around rock formations before they take the 64-foot plunge over the ledge. A moderately steep 5-mile round trip hiking trail takes visitors to an overlook above the segmented waterfall, but hikers rarely venture to the base.  There are 10 other waterfalls within a few miles, but take the time to see Triple Falls. It's one of most beautiful falls in the gorge because of its unusual, segmented pattern. Waimoku FallsMaui, Hawaii . Off the famous Hana Highway, nestled into the Kipahulu District of Maui's Haleakala National Park is the 400-foot Waimoku Falls. The falls are on the Pipiwai Trail, which gains 800 feet in elevation along the 4-mile round trip hike. On the way to Waimoku, hikers will pass the 185-foot Makahiku Falls and through a thick bamboo forest. Flowing down a steep lava-rock wall, covered by moss and vegetation, Waimoku Falls and the pool below are visible and accessible from a rocky hill above. Swimming is possible in the Kipahula District, but the pool under Waimoku Falls is not deep enough and falling rocks are a risk. There are much better-suited pools along the way. Check with the visitor center before you start your hike for current conditions. Blackwater FallsDavis, West Virginia . The dark water of appropriately named Blackwater Falls comes crashing down five stories into the river below at West Virginia's Blackwater Falls State Park. You can see the waterfall from numerous spots within the park, watching the amber-colored river plunge down and twist through the 8-mile long gorge. The tannic acid from fallen hemlock and red spruce needles is responsible for the tinted water that gives the spot its name. The falls are open year-round, with a beautiful array of wildflowers, panoramic views and a winter sled run. Shoshone Falls, Twin Falls, Idaho . Known as the Niagara of the West, the height of Idaho's Shoshone Falls is 212 feet, 36 feet taller than Niagara Falls. At their most powerful, the falls extend across the entire 900-foot-wide canyon, spilling into the Snake River below.  Depending on the volume of water, the falls can take the form of a few trickling streams or a solid wall of water. Spring and early summer are the best times to see the falls at full force. Nearby recreation areas offer an abundance of water sports, such as canoeing, kayaking and paddle boarding on the Snake River. Bridal Veil FallsValdez, Alaska . A frozen waterfall? In winter, that's what you'll find when you visit Bridal Veil Falls, about 15 miles outside Valdez, Alaska. For hikers who don't want to cross a glacier to get to the falls, the 2-mile Valdez Goat Trail has a great vantage point of the falls about a mile into the hike. For adventurous travelers up for the ice climb route, Bridal Veil Falls is one of the most accessible, lengthiest and widest ice climbs along the Keystone Canyon. Its closeness to the ocean keeps temperatures around freezing, rather than the sub-arctic temperatures seen in other parts of the canyon. Cascade FallsGiles County, Virginia . The creek waters of Cascade Falls in Virginia drop over a 69-foot rocky ledge into the pool below, giving the famous falls its name. Some of the streams tumble over several ridges on their way, while others take the steep drop all at once. A  2-mile hike along Little Stony Creek will lead visitors to the falls. Many hikers take a second upper trail for the two-mile hike back. The Cascades Recreation Area is the beginning of the hike to the falls, with the trail also open to horses and bicycles, as well as year-round trout fishing. During the winter, ice formations hang from the surrounding 200-foot cliff wall, with wooden stairs and platforms for close, easy viewing and great photographs of the falls. Vernal FallYosemite, California . By following the Mist Trail or the John Muir Trail inside California's Yosemite National Park, visitors will be treated to a close-up view of Vernal Fall. Vernal Fall is visible from a footbridge less than a mile into the hike. Just beyond the bridge the two trails diverge. Adventurous hikers can continue along the Mist Trail up 600 granite steps of ""nature's giant staircase"" to the top of 317-foot Vernal Fall. Expect waterfall spray in the spring and early summer. Beyond Vernal Fall on the Mist Trail you'll find the impressive Nevada Fall. While a late July wildfire has hit Yosemite, the park remains open and the falls remain accessible. Amid several years of drought, Vernal Fall is one of the better waterfalls to seek out, according to a National Park Service spokeswoman, because it is fed by a glacier and a spring in addition to snow melt. Some of the park's other falls are running dry due to the lack of precipitation. Potato River FallsGurney, Wisconsin . When most people think of the Midwest, waterfalls don't immediately spring to mind. Change your thinking: Potato River Falls, found in Gurney, Wisconsin, has been called one of the most beautiful waterfalls in the region. Located at the end of Potato River Falls Road in a county park, the falls are easily viewable from several trails. The waterfall, divided into Upper and Lower falls, plunges 90 feet into the river.  On the half-mile trail that leads to Upper Falls, hikers can access the top of Potato River Falls by following the river bank. Autumn visitors will also be treated to some wonderful opportunities to photograph the fall colors. Bond FallsPaulding, Michigan . One of the best kept secrets of Michigan's Western Upper Peninsula, Bond Falls has a 40-foot drop that extends 100 feet wide and divides into several smaller cascades. Located on the middle branch of the Ontonagon River near Paulding, Michigan, the falls have been designated a Michigan State Scenic site. Bond Falls is very accessible, with a level boardwalk from the parking area near the base of the falls leading visitors to a viewing point.","Alaska's Bridal Veil Falls is usually frozen in winter .

"(CNN)""Hot Tub Time Machine 2"" resurrects the time-traveling, R-rated antics of the cabin crew, with Adam Scott stepping in for John Cusack in the Steve Pink-directed follow-up to the 2010 hit comedy. More: Jessica Williams is next 'Daily Show' host in 'Hot Tub Time Machine 2' Starring Rob Corddry, Craig Robinson, Clark Duke, Gillian Jacobs and Chevy Chase, Paramount and MGM's Oscar-weekend release is tipped to earn $15 million or more. It was pushed back from its original Christmas Day release date, when it was set to square off against ""The Interview"" with Seth Rogen and James Franco. See what top critics are saying about ""Hot Tub Time Machine 2"": . The Hollywood Reporter's John DeFore calls it ""a flop-sweaty cash grab that gives a bad name to sequels in which key talent has jumped ship. ... Suffering from much more than awkwardness over the absence of the original's top-billed Cusack, though it is certainly awkward about that, the film makes us wonder why we enjoyed spending time with his three returning costars in the first place. ... Scott fills the cast's likeability void nicely. But the character bears the brunt of the meanest gags in an intensely mean-spirited, arguably misogynistic film, one so dumb about its attempts to wring humor from taboos that it at one point has the victim of forcible sodomy pay a dreamy compliment to the size of his assailant's genitals."" More: 'Hot Tub Time Machine 2' Spot Mocks Deflate-gate . USA Today's Claudia Puig gives it two stars out of four, writing, ""Some of the gags are stupid-funny, others are just puerile, making for a hit-or-miss experience. The screenplay presents the thinnest of plots. ... Don't expect consistency or much logic."" Altogether, ""Like the first foray, the sequel is a good-natured raunch-fest that induces eye-rolling about as much as it does laughter. ... For those who liked the first movie and find a plethora of penis jokes hilarious, this is a fitting sequel. But others should stay away."" The Guardian's Jordan Hoffman says it's worth one star out of five: ""I hated Hot Tub Time Machine 2 so much I now can't even think about the first one without feeling annoyed. This may suggest that the only solution is to go and make a third one to rescue the franchise, but really it may be time to leave well enough alone."" Due to a flimsy plot ""where nothing is at stake, ... even the brilliant Robinson, whose every utterance gets at least a chuckle, can't save the movie. ... truly, there's nothing besides repeated use of swear words in lieu of wit."" More: 'Hot Tub Time Machine 2' trailer goes back to the future (and beyond) New York Post's Kyle Smith notes, ""Within five minutes you'll guess why Cusack, not overly encumbered with big film roles these days, didn't return for the sequel: The script is monotonous, meandering and witless, frantically ramming together middle-school non-ideas such as a guy being forced to rape another guy on a reality show, or a guy's testicles projectile-exploding into the faces of two other guys, or a guy being shot in both the head and the man-parts. ... The smart plotting of the first film is completely gone.""","Follow-up to the 2010 hit comedy stars Adam Scott, Rob Corddry and Craig Robinson ."
"China's brand new moon rover is already saying farewell. The diminutive lunar explorer, known as Jade Rabbit, or ""Yutu"" in Chinese, was about halfway through a three-month mission to study the moon's crust when it suffered a potentially crippling breakdown, said state media. The report, authored by China's state-run Xinhua news, was written in the voice of the rover itself. ""Although I should've gone to bed this morning, my masters discovered something abnormal with my mechanical control system,"" said the Xinhua report, in the voice of the Jade Rabbit. ""My masters are staying up all night working for a solution. I heard their eyes are looking more like my red rabbit eyes."" ""Nevertheless, I'm aware that I might not survive this lunar night,"" it added. During a lunar night, which lasts about 14 Earth days, the moon's surface temperature can plunge to minus-180 Celsius. To make it through the cold, the lunar rover must ""hibernate"" to preserve its delicate electronics. If a mechanical problem keeps it from hibernating properly, then the Rabbit could freeze to death. Named after a mythical rabbit who lives on the moon, Yutu was a source of national pride when it launched into space last December along with the lunar lander Chang'e-3, named after the moon goddess who kept Yutu by her side. The successful lunar landing made China the third country in the world to perform a ""soft landing"" on the moon's surface. Earlier, Yutu and Chang'e survived their first lunar night together, from Christmas until the second week of January. The Chang'e-3 lander successfully entered a second hibernation on Friday and is expected to function normally for another year. ""[Chang'e] doesn't know about my problems yet,"" said the voice of Yutu in the Xinhua report. ""If I can't be fixed, everyone please comfort her."" On social media, thousands of Chinese internet users sent their well-wishes to the little robot. ""You have done a great job, Yutu. You have endured extreme hot and cold temperatures and shown us what we have never seen,"" wrote one microblogger, as quoted by Xinhua. Another wrote: ""This is too heavy a burden. If the rabbit can not stand again, maybe we should let it have a rest."" Despite the setbacks, even the little Rabbit seemed aware of the odds it had overcome. ""Before departure, I studied the history of mankind's lunar probes. About half of the past 130 explorations ended in success; the rest ended in failure,"" noted the Jade Rabbit in its report. ""This is space exploration; the danger comes with its beauty. I am but a tiny dot in the vast picture of mankind's adventure in space. ""The sun has fallen, and the temperature is dropping so quickly... to tell you all a secret, I don't feel that sad. I was just in my own adventure story - and like every hero, I encountered a small problem,"" said the Rabbit. ""Goodnight, Earth,"" it said. ""Goodnight, humanity.""

"(CNN)President Barack Obama may change the United States' plan to withdraw virtually all its troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2016, his new defense secretary said Saturday during a visit to the central Asian nation -- an indication that the White House is considering extending the U.S. troop presence there beyond that year. U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter made the comment in a news conference in Kabul with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who has previously called on Obama to ""re-examine"" the withdrawal plan to ensure his country has the support it needs to maintain security gains. Carter arrived in Afghanistan's capital on Saturday during his first foreign trip since being sworn in as defense secretary four days ago. ""Our priority now is to make sure this progress sticks. That is why President Obama is considering a number of options to reinforce our support for President Ghani's security strategy, including possible changes to the time line for our drawdown of U.S. troops,"" Carter said. ""That could mean taking another look at the timing and sequencing of base closures to ensure we have the right array of coalition capabilities to support our Afghan partners,"" he said. After Ghani's election last year, Afghanistan and the United States signed a security agreement that allowed U.S. troops to stay in Afghanistan beyond the previous December 2014 deadline to withdraw. Under the current plan, the United States ended its combat presence in Afghanistan in December, but nearly 11,000 troops remained at the start of 2015 for training and support roles. American forces currently are expected to drop to 5,500 in 2016, and by 2017 the U.S. military presence is to scale down to what officials described as a ""normal"" embassy security contingent. Last month, Ghani told CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that Obama should reconsider the 2016 withdrawal plan. ""Deadlines concentrate the mind. But deadlines should not be dogmas,"" Ghani said in the ""60 Minutes"" interview. He continued: ""If both parties or, in this case, multiple partners, have done their best to achieve the objectives and progress is very real, then there should be willingness to re-examine a deadline."" Carter recently took over as secretary of defense, replacing Chuck Hagel. The Senate confirmed Carter on February 12, and he sworn in on Tuesday. Carter plans to meet with U.S. troops and other Afghan leaders during his Afghanistan trip Saturday and Sunday. Before his plane landed in Kabul, Carter told reporters he wants to better understand America's role in Afghanistan. ""I have seen reports of all kinds giving assessment of how things are going in Afghanistan and I'm just coming back into the government now and trying to wrap my mind around it,"" he said. When asked about ISIS activity in Afghanistan, Carter replied: ""I've seen the reports of people essentially rebranding themselves as ISIL here in Afghanistan as has occurred in other places. The reports I've seen still have them in small numbers and aspirational."" Carter, 60, is a respected technocrat who served in a number of high-level positions at the Pentagon. He holds degrees in theoretical physics and medieval history from Yale and Oxford. Hagel, a former Republican senator, resigned after less than two years on the job when he was unable to fully mesh with Obama's national security team at the White House.

Carter recently took over as secretary of defense, replacing Chuck Hagel. The Senate confirmed Carter on February 12.

"With talks deadlocked between the United States and Russia over plans to deploy a missile defense shield in Europe, a top Russian general raised the possibility of a possible pre-emptive strike against launch sites if a deal could not be reached. The warning by Gen. Nikolai Makarov followed the conclusion of the international Missile Defense Conference in Russia, where Russian officials lobbied against the missile shield. ""Taking into account the destabilizing nature of the missile defense system and, in particular, creating an illusion of an unpunishable strike, the decision about a pre-emptive use of force will be made in a period of heightened tension,"" Makarov said. The Obama administration and its European allies have been trying  to ease Russia's fears over the project by insisting that the system is directed toward countering the missile threat from the Middle East from which Russia also needs protection. Since NATO approved the U.S.-designed system at last year's summit , Poland, Romania, Spain and Turkey have agreed to deploy parts of it. NATO asked Russia to participate in the system but negotiations have been deadlocked over Russia's demand for a legally binding treaty guaranteeing the shield would not be used as a deterrent to Moscow's own systems. During Thursday's conference, the U.S. special envoy for strategic stability and missile defense said there were discussions aimed at easing Russia's concern. ""We discussed how the European missile defense system is designed and configured to counter ballistic missile threats from the Middle East, and we have made clear we have no intent or desire to undermine Russia's strategic deterrent,"" said Ellen Tauscher, the special envoy. But Marakov believes the defense shield would be able to take out Russian missiles. To drive the point home, Russia opened up one of its elite radar operations to conference attendees and showed a computer simulation of an attack against Europe and Russia. As part of the simulation, four missiles were launched from somewhere in the southern hemisphere and targeted three cities in Europe and one in Russia. When Russia launched a missile to intercept it, its missile was taken out by the European missile defense system. But the United States says the radar and interceptor missiles it plans to place in eastern Europe won't have the ability to shoot down Russian missiles. NATO Deputy Secretary-General Alexander Vershbow, who listened to Makarov's comments, told reporters he does not believe a missile defense system in Europe would not affect Russia. ""I took careful note of the details that Gen. Makarov presented about their plans. But he did indicate that those steps would not be implemented until Russia was convinced that the threat, the so-called threat from our missile defense system was growing,"" he said. ""So we have time to reassure Russia that there is no threat today and there'll be no threat tomorrow."" Late last year, then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev threatened to withdraw from the START treaty on nuclear weapons reductions and deploy ballistic missiles in its exclave of Kaliningrad on its border with Europe if NATO moved ahead with the plans for missile defense. Tensions increased in December when Russia's ambassador to NATO, suggested Moscow would close transit routes that send vital supplies to troops in Afghanistan. The deadlock over the missile defense shield has also proved problematic for leaders from both the United States and Russia. At a nuclear summit in South Korea, President Barack Obama could be heard asking Dmitry Medvedev for some ""space"" on the missile defense system in Europe, telling the Russian president he will have more ""flexibility"" after the November election. ""This is my last election,"" Obama said. ""After my election I have more flexibility."" In response, Medvedev said he would pass on the information to the incoming prime minister and former president, Vladimir Putin. Republicans in the United States seized on the comment as an opportunity to criticize the president for politicizing foreign policy decisions. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin has repeatedly in recent years warned the U.S. and its European allies against deploying such a defense system, saying Russia would be forced to deploy its own countermeasures.","Russian Gen.

"The video clip lasts a mere 35 seconds. It's night. Six men, illuminated by a flashlight, are sitting with their hands tied behind their backs and with various types of blindfolds. More men huddle behind them in the dark. In front of them is a pit, apparently freshly dug, and on the other side of the pit sits another man similarly bound and blindfolded. Two seconds into the clip, someone says, ""Jahiz?"" ""Ready?"" At three seconds a man extends his right arm into the light, holding a pistol. At six seconds the first shot is fired into the back of the first man's head. The man with the pistol moves decisively, without hesitation, shooting one after the other in the back of the head. It would appear he has done this before many times. Eleven seconds into the video clip, you can hear what sounds like open faucets. It's the sound of blood gushing from the head wounds. And the gushing sound gets louder and louder. Twenty-six seconds after the first shot is fired, a total of 14 men -- some of whom appear to be teenagers -- are dead or dying, some slumping into the pit. This video clip was one of a variety recently obtained by CNN from Syrian activists. They document atrocities committed not by the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, but rather by members of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, known as ISIS, which emerged last year as a major power in opposition-controlled parts of northern Syria. In the areas controlled by ISIS, public floggings and executions have become commonplace. Most recently ISIS has battled other opposition groups in fighting that has left well over 2,000 people dead. Even Al Qaeda's leader, Ayman Al-Zawahiri, has demanded ISIS leave Syria. The material CNN obtained provides a snapshot of the inner workings of ISIS, a group using methods and tactics not unlike those of the regime that Syrians rose up against almost three years ago. The material provided by the activists was found in a house in Aleppo occupied by one ""Abu Ahmed Al-Iraqi,"" or ""the Iraqi."" As is so often the case with members of these radical groups, this is not his real name. He abandoned the video clips, as well as the camera they were shot with, when ISIS retreated from the area during fighting against other opposition groups. Activists describe Abu Ahmed as an ""amir,"" a commander, responsible for carrying out justice, ISIS style. He is, in effect, judge, jury and executioner. He appears to be the man who carried out the executions described above. The other clips include eight interrogations of men, most of whom are members of opposition factions not affiliated with ISIS, all operating in or around the town of Al-Bab, northeast of Aleppo. It's not clear whether Abu Ahmed Al-Iraqi is doing the interrogations, but the strong Iraqi accent of the interrogators leaves no doubt about where they come from. No torture occurs on camera, but it's clear the subjects are under duress. They are all blindfolded, and several sweat profusely. The line of questioning is persistent, always focusing on the activities and opinions of opposition members. Not once in the course of the lengthy interrogations is a single question posed about the Assad regime. In fact, it's not even mentioned. There are veiled threats; one of the men, who identifies himself as a doctor named Basil, is asked if he ever wants to see his two children again. Another young man, Mohamed, is told to speak the truth to ""save himself."" He responds by saying, ""I will speak the truth, even if I lose my head."" ISIS is clearly worried that many Syrians view them as unwanted interlopers. Thousands of young men have flocked from around the world, including Europe and North America, to join the fight against the Assad regime, and many of the more radical among them have joined ISIS and other jihadi groups. At one point the interrogator demands of the aforementioned Mohamed: ""Didn't people say ISIS are strangers? That they wear ""chabounat?"" Chabounat is a derisive term referring to the short jalabiyas, or robes, worn by hard-line Islamists to copy the attire of the Prophet Mohammed. Chabounat in this case might be the equivalent of petticoats. Mohamed wisely claims complete ignorance. From the video clips, it appears that Abu Ahmed has made a life for himself in Syria. In a series of clips he is instructing a young woman in a black coat how to use an AK-47 assault rifle and a pistol. Her face is exposed -- she is not wearing the ""niqab,"" which completely covers the face and has become de rigueur dress for women in areas controlled by ISIS. She speaks with a Syrian accent. He's also getting around in a late-model black BMW SUV. And in another video clip, he is doing target practice in the garden of a high-walled villa. A fancy car, nice house, interrogations and mass executions: meet the new boss in this part of Syria. Same as the old boss.","Videos obtained by Syrian opposition activists show executions, interrogations .

"(CNN)Liberia reopened its land border crossings shut down during the Ebola outbreak, a positive sign in a nation that was the epicenter of the deadly virus. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf also lifted a nationwide curfew imposed in August to help combat the virus. Her orders, which went into effect Sunday, come the same week schools reopened after a five-month hiatus. The  virus has killed about 9,365 people mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, according to the World Health Organization. About 3,900 of the deaths have been in Liberia, which was so badly affected, it declared a shortage of body bags last year. In October, the World Health Organization said the number of new cases in Liberia was declining, with fewer burials, plateauing lab confirmations and less-cramped hospitals. In its most recent update, the WHO reported two new confirmed cases in Liberia for the week ending on February 15.  In contrast, a total of 52 new cases were reported in Guinea while Sierra Leone had 74. Liberia closed its borders with Sierra Leone and Guinea in July in response to the outbreak.  Those borders will reopen Sunday, Johnson Sirleaf  said. Though the President expressed optimism, she warned against complacency. ""The ministry of health has been requested to ensure the adoption and implementation of health protocols that will prevent the importation of the virus through any of the crossing points,"" she said in a statement. ""Members of the joint security assigned at the borders are mandated to work closely with the health authorities to ensure adherence to the health protocols and safety at all times.""

"(CNN)It's not unusual for men to join the fight for women's rights. But it is if they choose to wear miniskirts while they do it. The brutal murder of a Turkish woman, Ozgecan Aslan, 20, who allegedly fought off a sexual assault before her body was burned and dumped in a riverbed, has sparked protests on the street and social media. The Twitter hashtag #OzgecanAslan prompted thousands of tweets, with many women posting photos of themselves clad in black. And in recent days, #ozgecanicinminietekgiy, translated as ""wear a miniskirt for Ozgecan,"" has begun circulating, often accompanied with a photo of a man wearing a short skirt. And it apparently doesn't matter where the apparel came from, as long as it is worn. Some were not afraid to admit their reservations about the method of protest, but still voiced their full support for the message. Prominent Turkish lawyer and activist Hulya Gulbahar said the skirt protest is ""very effective"" and the first time women's rights have been so widely endorsed in Turkey. ""The women's movement is trying to tell society, 'My dress is not an excuse for your rape or sexual harassment.' But society didn't want to hear these voices. ""People try to find excuses for rapes and killings. But they didn't find any in this case, because Aslan was very innocent, purely innocent. The protest shows that a short skirt is not an excuse for rape."" Women's rights in Turkey have been the subject of much debate in recent years. In December last year, U.N. Women signed an agreement along with Turkish conglomerate Koc Holding's CEO, Turgay Durak, to strengthen women's economic and social empowerment in the country. And in 2011, Turkey was among 14 countries to ratify a European Treaty aiming to combat violence against women. But official statistics strongly suggest the need for reform. In a joint statement last week, representatives from U.N. Women and UNFPA said: ""Notwithstanding the progress in Turkish legislation and institutional structuring, recent data on violence against women shows insignificant improvement since 2008 and violence against women is still pervasive with two out of every five women in Turkey exposed to sexual and physical violence."" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who condemned Aslan's murder on Twitter, was criticized for claiming at an event last year that men and women are not equal. ""At least five women are killed a day,"" says Gulbahar, citing a figure originally stated by Yasemin Yucel, the deputy chairwoman of the Tarsus branch of the Education Personnel Union. Gulbahar argues that the government's attitude is the first factor that needs to change, as it only views women as mothers. ""Our President and government are saying to society everyday that they do not believe in women and men's equality; woman is [seen as] God's gift to man, the man protects the woman. ""They try to make these ideas all of society's ideas. But some women and men are resisting now."" Some, though, have questioned the wider significance of the miniskirt protest. ""I don't know how effective it is,"" Istanbul-based journalist Andrew Finkel told CNN. ""It's obviously a clever protest, Turkish men showing their feminine side. Whether it's going to move Turkish society, I don't know. ""Reaction to the death has been massive. The miniskirt protest is not the main event in that protest -- it's not as if every man on Turkish streets is now wearing a miniskirt. ""Whereas the reaction to this woman's death has been very substantial, and has made a lot of people think about their political attitudes."" He adds that the murder has invoked a host of different reactions in Turkish people, proving both divisive and unifying. ""A society like Turkey is so polarized between supporters and opponents of the government -- a snowdrop doesn't fall without some political significance and dividing people into political clans."" With 69% of men in paid work in Turkey compared to 29% of women, more women in the workplace is a good place to start establishing gender equality, says Finkel. ""Personal savings [in Turkey] are low because you don't have more than one earner in the household. There's a drive to get women into real jobs. If you get more women into employment, you have to change social rules which objectify and discriminate against women."" Although there are deeper issues involved, the miniskirt protest has raised awareness and challenged views. ""The real problem is a series of attitudes that have now been ingrained in the courts and in patriarchal society. Some people have begun to reconsider those and I guess the skirt protest is just one way of calling on Turkish men to reconsider their attitudes,"" says Finkel. ""[The miniskirt protest is] small but I think the symbolic meaning is very good,"" says Gulbahar.","Men have been wearing miniskirts in support of women's rights in Turkey .
The murder of 20-year-old Ozgecan Aslan sparked an outcry .

"(CNN)How big a threat is Al-Shabaab to the United States? Despite the Somali terrorist group's calls over the weekend for attacks on malls in the West, including the vast Mall of America in Minnesota, the group isn't much of a threat at all to Americans. The reality is that Al-Shabaab has shown scant abilities to conduct operations outside of Somalia or neighboring countries such as Kenya. Indeed, the only operation anyone associated with the group has attempted in the West is when a Somali man armed with an ax in 2010 forced himself into the home of Kurt Westergaard -- a Danish cartoonist who had depicted the Prophet Mohammed with a bomb in his turban -- and tried unsuccessfully to break into the fortified safe room where Westergaard was hiding. Danish intelligence officials said the suspect had links with Al-Shabaab. That said, the group has succeeded in recruiting a number of Americans to fight in Somalia, most of whom are from Minnesota. Seven Somali-American men traveled from Minnesota to Somalia to fight for Al-Shabaab in late 2007, including Shirwa Ahmed, who graduated from high school in Minneapolis and then worked at the Minneapolis airport pushing passengers in wheelchairs. During this period, he became increasingly religious, and in his spare time, he would counsel drunken Somali kids in the impoverished area of Minneapolis known as ""Little Mogadishu,"" after the Somali capital, to embrace their own culture. Ahmed left Minneapolis for good on December 4, 2007, on a flight that took him to Saudi Arabia, from where he eventually made his way to Somalia. In Somalia, he was trained by Al-Shabaab on the use of a wide variety of guns and weapons. On October 29, 2008, he drove a truck loaded with explosives toward a government compound in Puntland, northern Somalia, blowing himself up and killing 20 other people, becoming what then-FBI director Robert Mueller described as the first U.S. citizen to conduct a terrorist suicide bombing. Ahmed's suicide caused considerable consternation at the FBI. If an American citizen was willing to die in a suicide operation overseas, what might that say about the possibility of Americans conducting suicidal attacks in the States? One only had to look at the British experience to understand how this could develop. In 2003, a British citizen had conducted a suicide bombing at a jazz club frequented by Americans in Tel Aviv, Israel. This turned out to be something of a curtain-raiser for future terrorist attacks in the United Kingdom. Two years after the terrorist attack in Israel, four British citizens committed suicide in bombings on London's transportation system on July 7, 2005. It was the most deadly terrorist attack ever on British soil, claiming 52 lives. Alarmed by Al-Shabaab's campaign of suicide attacks across Somalia and its recruitment of Americans, the State Department designated the group as a foreign terrorist organization in March 2008, making it illegal for a person in the United States to knowingly provide Al-Shabaab with money, communications equipment, weapons or explosives or to join the group. By 2008, the Somali-Americans traveling to their homeland to join the al Qaeda aligned Al-Shabaab seemed like a particularly threatening cohort. Codenamed Operation Rhino, the FBI started a serious effort to crack down on anyone traveling to Somalia to support Al-Shabaab. Adding to the alarm at the FBI, in early June 2011, the agency announced that Farah Mohamed Beledi, from Minneapolis, had detonated a bomb, becoming one of two suicide attackers responsible for killing two African Union soldiers in Somalia. The third American to conduct a suicide attack was Abdisalan Hussein Ali, a 22-year-old from Minneapolis who took part in a strike on African Union troops in Mogadishu on October 29, 2011. There may even have been a fourth American suicide attacker in Somalia. On September 17, 2009, two stolen U.N. vehicles loaded with bombs blew up at Mogadishu airport, killing more than a dozen peacekeepers of the African Union. The FBI suspected that 18-year-old Omar Mohamud of Seattle was one of the bombers. But Al-Shabaab's American support network has extended beyond Minnesota. Ruben Shumpert, an African-American convert to Islam from Seattle, was killed in Somalia in 2008. And a former U.S. soldier from Maryland, Craig Baxam, was arrested by Kenyan authorities in 2011 as he tried to make his way to Somalia to join Al-Shabaab, which he told FBI agents he considered to be a religious duty. Still, despite these developments, for the Americans who traveled to Somalia to fight for Al-Shabaab, it has typically been a one-way ticket. More than a dozen Americans have died while fighting for Al- Shabaab, according to a U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security report, while none of the Americans recruited by Al-Shabaab is known to have subsequently planned or conducted a terrorist attack inside the United States, according to a survey of more than 250 jihadist terrorism cases since the 9/11 attacks conducted by New America. The possibility remains, of course, that Al-Shabaab's calls for attack on malls in the West might inspire a lone wolf attack. But there is no sign so far that Al-Shabaab's recruits have actually plotted to launch an attack in the United States. For now, at least, the group has also not shown that it is capable of carrying out attacks in the West.","Al-Shabaab has released a video calling for attacks on shopping malls in West .

"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday would not say the United States is at war with ISIS, telling CNN in an interview that the administration's strategy includes ""many different things that one doesn't think of normally in context of war."" ""What we are doing is engaging in a very significant counterterrorism operation,"" Kerry told CNN's Elise Labott in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. ""It's going to go on for some period of time. If somebody wants to think about it as being a war with ISIL, they can do so, but the fact is it's a major counterterrorism operation that will have many different moving parts."" Kerry made a distinction between ISIS and terror groups operating in Somalia and Yemen. ""ISIL is an animal unto itself,"" he said. ""And it is significantly such a threat because of the foreign fighters that are attracted to it -- which you don't see in Somalia or ... Yemen."" Most importantly, Kerry said, ISIL has attracted a ""significant coalition"" that is determined to go and destroy it. Kerry, in Jeddah for meetings with Arab leaders to enlist regional support for a coalition to defeat ISIS, defended the administration's insistence that the 2001 authority to go after al Qaeda and affiliates applies to ISIS. He insisted that, despite the split between jihadist groups, the origin of ISIS as an al Qaeda affiliate is enough to consider them connected. ""This group is and has been al Qaeda,"" Kerry said. ""By trying to change its name, it doesn't change who it is, what it does."" Asked how much of the interpretation lets Congress get away from a vote on going after ISIS -- a scenario lawmakers would like to avoid in an election year -- Kerry responded ""none."" Kerry said the opposition battling the regime of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria has been outgunned and outmanned, but the administration believes that equation can change ""if they receive proper training, if there are recruits that come in, and if it grows over a period of time."" The regime's legitimacy could never be restored, Kerry said. ""It is going to be our policy to separate (al-Assad), who is mostly in the western part of Syria, in a certain corridor from the eastern part of Syria, which he doesn't control,"" Kerry said. ""ISIL controls that part. So it is clearly ... not a very difficult task to target ISIL."" The talks in Jeddah come a day after U.S. President Barack Obama outlined a plan to ""dismantle and ultimately destroy"" the Sunni extremist group that has seized a swath of territory across Iraq and Syria. Videotaped beheadings, including two murders of American journalists, have led to the push for a broader counterterrorism mission, including possible airstrikes in civil war-torn Syria. But the United States has ruled out sending American troops for a ground offensive. On Thursday, Kerry met with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal in Jeddah before wider talks with other regional leaders. Asked whether Saudi Arabia supports the extremist expressions of the Wahhabism version of Islam espoused by some terror groups, Kerry told CNN that the nation is ""deeply committed to the effort to terminate ISIL."" ""They have never funded the kind of effort you're talking about with respect to ISIL,"" Kerry said, adding that a significant part of the counterterrorism effort will include stemming fundraising for terror groups. After Saudi Arabia, Kerry will visit Turkey and Egypt for meetings with senior officials, state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. In a statement after Obama's prime-time speech Wednesday, Kerry said the President's strategy would succeed ""because doing it with allies and partners isn't just smart, it's strong."" Kerry said his travels through the Middle East and Europe over the coming days were an effort to ""meet a unifying threat with a unified response."" While American leadership is ""indispensable,"" he said, ""we cannot destroy this group on our own. Defeating this common enemy calls for a common cause, and we're taking it on to succeed together."" Obama spoke Wednesday with Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, a senior administration official told journalists. ""The Saudis made very clear that they support this mission, they will join us in this mission,"" the official said. The backing of Sunni-dominated nations such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Turkey will lend support to any campaign to contain the spread of ISIS. Turkey's capacity or willingness to act may be limited by the fact that ISIS continues to hold 47 Turkish hostages seized from the northern Iraqi city of Mosul. So far, Shiite-majority Iran has played the biggest role on the ground in northern Iraq, where its militias have been helping Iraqi forces. ISIS, which now calls itself the ""Islamic State,"" has said it is bent on creating an Islamic ""caliphate"" in Iraq and Syria where harsh Sharia law governs every aspect of life. Iraqi leader: 'Everybody's on board' Baghdad was the first stop on Kerry's tour, where he met with Iraq's new Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. In a joint news conference with Kerry on Wednesday, al-Abadi said the international community had a responsibility to help defend Iraqis from the threat posed by ISIS. He also said Iraqis had worked hard recently to form an inclusive government where ""everybody's on board"" to fight the militants. In a separate news conference, Kerry said the U.S. was already coordinating with some 40 other nations to provide humanitarian, military and other assistance to Iraqis to fight ISIS. The United States has so far launched more than 150 airstrikes to weaken the militants in Iraq, Kerry said. Syria airstrikes . Obama said Wednesday that 475 more U.S. military advisers will head to Iraq, raising the total of American forces there to 1,700 for a mission originally described as limited. He also shifted $25 million in military aid to Iraqi forces, including Kurdish fighters in the north combating the ISIS extremists. The aid could include ammunition, small arms and vehicles, as well as military education and training, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. It's not clear how soon U.S. forces will launch operations in Syria. Senior administration officials who briefed reporters before Obama's speech on condition of not being identified said airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria would occur ""at a time and place of our choosing."" ""We're not going to telegraph our punches by being specific about the time and nature of the targets,"" one official said, adding that ""we will do that as necessary as we develop targets."" 'Very difficult, long road' Kerry met with Jordan's King Abdullah II in Jordan before leaving Thursday morning for the Saudi seaside city of Jeddah, where he was scheduled to meet with the leaders of half a dozen Persian Gulf states. In addition to support for a military campaign against ISIS, administration officials said the United States would be looking to its Gulf allies to crack down on ISIS funding and stop the flow of foreign fighters, both seen as the lifeblood of the jihadist group. The United States also wants Sunni Arab states, particularly Saudi Arabia, to counter ISIS by helping to persuade other Sunnis to eschew its ideology. ""It's going to be a very difficult, long road to get there, but it's something that the region and our partners in the Gulf can play a really important role in,"" a senior State Department official traveling with Kerry said. ""And there's a number of different ways that they can do that, both in terms of just their relationships, in terms of their encouragement, in terms of their financial contributions, in terms of lifting the burden that the government here has."" After Saudi Arabia, Kerry will travel to Paris to attend an international conference on Iraq, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. Obama will chair a meeting later this month at the U.N. General Assembly, where the global strategy is expected to be hammered out. Kerry: 'Broad coalition' of nations will help fight ISIS .

"At least 15 boys were killed when Syrian forces dropped a barrel bomb on a mosque operating as a makeshift school in Aleppo, the opposition Syrian Coalition said Wednesday. Barrel bombs are drums packed with explosives and shrapnel, which are then dropped from the sky. Tuesday's attack is the second barrel bomb raid in two days in the northern Syrian city, which has become a flashpoint of the country's civil war. ""Each and every day that the barrel-bombing of Aleppo continues, the Assad regime reminds the world of its true colors,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement after the attack. ""Each and every barrel bomb filled with metal shrapnel and fuel launched against innocent Syrians underscores the barbarity of a regime that has turned its country into a super magnet for terror."" Later, Kerry defended U.S. policy toward Syria in an exclusive interview on CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper."" However, he did not dispute entirely a U.S. intelligence assessment that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has regained some footing since agreeing to turn over chemical weapons to the international community to avoid possible military action against his regime. ""It's fair to say that Assad has improved his position a little bit, yes,"" Kerry said. ""But he's still not winning. This is a stalemate."" Barrel bomb toll . On Monday, 26 people were killed, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.  And over the weekend, barrel bombs killed 126 people there. ""The mosque was being used as a school after all schools in the area were either hit or brimming with internally displaced civilians,"" Khalid Saleh of the Syrian Coalition said about Tuesday's attack. ""Giving up on learning was not an option for these children, but the hatred of the Assad regime was blind enough to deprive them not only from their right to education but also from their right to live."" Opinion: A terror group too brutal for al Qaeda? 'Children, there are children' Opposition groups have blamed the attacks on al-Assad. The Syrian government has previously said that military operations are targeting ""terrorist groups"" in neighborhoods of the city. Videos posted online after the attack on the Othman Bin Affan mosque Tuesday showed angry residents, arms raised to the sky, cursing at al-Assad. ""Children, there are children,"" some shouted. One man, standing in front of a child's body, sobbed, ""Oh God, we've had enough."" ""Why us,"" a child told an activist who filmed the aftermath of the attack. ""We are not rebel fighters, we are children."" CNN cannot independently verify the death tolls or the authenticity of the videos.

"(CNN)As threats in the Middle East grow, there's a pressing need in the region, Egypt's President said Sunday. ""The need for a unified Arab force is growing and becoming more pressing every day,"" President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said in a televised address, noting that Jordan and the United Arab Emirates have offered to send troops as Egypt steps up its efforts to battle ISIS in neighboring Libya. ""The challenges in the region, and facing our countries, are huge challenges, and ... we can overcome those challenges once we are together,"" el-Sisi said. El-Sisi's comment comes after a series of Egyptian airstrikes targeting ISIS in Libya in retaliation for the slaughter of 21 Egyptian Christians by the jihadist group. On Sunday, he said the Egyptian army isn't an aggressor angling to invade foreign territory. ""Your armed forces only protect the people of Egypt, and we coordinate with our Arab brothers,"" el-Sisi said.
