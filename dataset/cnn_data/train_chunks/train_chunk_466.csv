"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . Last updated at 8:29 PM on 26th January 2012 . Escape: A manhunt is underway for Andrew Farndon after he was freed from a taxi as he was taken to hospital after apparently stabbing himself . Dramatic new CCTV footage has emerged revealing the incredible moment a second prisoner in a week was sprung from a taxi at gunpoint. A manhunt is under way today after two prison officers were threatened at gunpoint and forced to release 26-year-old Andrew Farndon. The pictures released by Suffolk police show the gunman approaching the vehicle and two men fleeing the scene outside West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmonds. Farndon was being taken to the hospital from HMP Highpoint, a Category C prison 12 miles away, after he had apparently stabbed himself in order to carry out the plan. It is the second time Farndon has escaped from custody, having leapt from the dock during his 2007 court case over a violent attack. He was serving an indeterminate sentence for causing grievous bodily harm in 2007 with a minimum two-year jail term. He was due to undergo treatment at the hospital's accident and emergency department, but instead a waiting gunman confronted the male and female guards and fled with Farndon across a car park. A police manhunt is now under way following the incident at 6.40pm yesterday evening. Hospital staff contacted police saying they saw the prison security officers being threatened with a gun, and the officers rang to confirm they had been ambushed. Racing away: CCTV images issued by Suffolk Police show a gunman approaching the scene at West Suffolk Hospital, left, and then leaving with prisoner Andrew Farndon, right . Witnesses: Police want to speak to these people, who they believe may have witnessed the incident . Investigating: A police car is seen outside West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds, where the escape took place . Detective Chief Inspector Nick Bennett said armed response officers arrived on the scene within five minutes. He said Farndon had been taken to hospital in a saloon from a local taxi firm, believed to be A1 Taxis in Bury St Edmunds. The company refused to comment. Mr Bennett said he understood it was standard practice to transport prisoners to hospital by taxi unless there was a 'specific risk'. He added: 'He was handcuffed to a female prison officer who removed the handcuffs when a handgun was pointed at her head. A male prison officer was also escorting him.' Searches were continuing in Suffolk but Mr Bennett said it was unlikely Farndon was still in the county. Forces across Britain, including the neighbouring counties of Norfolk, Essex and Cambridgeshire, along with West Midlands Police, have issued appeals for information. Mr Bennett added: 'Along with other forces, we are pursuing various lines of inquiry, including contacting his family, friends and associates in the West Midlands. 'We are also studying CCTV and number-plate recognition records to try to identify the car which was used in the escape. 'Another line of inquiry is whether any mobile phones were used in the planning and execution of this escape. 'His prison cell has been searched and various items recovered. No blade was found in this search. 'The prison officers are still shaken and it was obviously a terrifying ordeal.' A spokesman for Suffolk Police said: . 'Officers were contacted just after 6.50pm by staff at the Accident . & Emergency reception of the West Suffolk Hospital at Hardwick Lane . in Bury St Edmunds who reported they could see a man with a gun outside . the A&E department. 'They said the man was pointing the weapon at two prison officers. 'Moments later police received a second call from the prison officers, from HMP Highpoint, who said they had a gun pulled on them by a man who had confronted them as they had arrived at A&E with a prisoner who had been stabbed in an incident at the prison.' Farndon - whose family live in the Coventry area - is white, with a shaved head and goatee beard, and was wearing a dark blue baseball cap with a light-coloured jumper, padded on the right side due to his injury to the shoulder. Scene: Staff at West Suffolk Hospital reported seeing a man wielding a gun, which he aimed in the direction of two officers who were guarding Farndon . On guard: A police officer stands outside the entrance to the A&E department following the incident . HMP Highpoint, a Category C prison with around 380 inmates where Andrew Farden was being held . The gunman was also white, in his mid-40s, about 5ft 8ins tall and is believed to have had a Scottish accent. The release of Farndon is the second in a week after John Anslow (pictured) was sprung from a prison van . He was wearing a white top and blue jeans and it is thought they escaped in a dark-coloured car and may have had accomplices. Police are advising members of the public not to approach the men if they see them. The . escape is the second in just a week, after category A prisoner John . Anslow was sprung from a prison van after it left Hewell Prison in . Worcestershire. Justice minister Crispin Blunt said there was no suggestion Farndon's escape was linked to Monday's incident. 'Clearly, we will be examining the circumstances,' he said. 'The most important thing at the moment is to get this man back in custody and to investigate the full facts of the case.' A Prison Service spokeswoman said a full Prison Service inquiry would follow. Former convict Mark Leech, editor of the national prisoners' newspaper Converse, called for a full inquiry into how both escapes were possible. 'Forget reform, rehabilitation or reducing reoffending, the first and primary function of the Prison Service is security,' he said. 'How is it that security intelligence at these prisons missed completely both of these clearly pre-planned escapes?' Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke has ordered an inquiry into how Anslow, described as 'extremely dangerous' by police, became the first category A prisoner to escape in more than 17 years on Monday. Instead of being transferred in a high-security prison service van with a police escort, Anslow was with other inmates in a van run by a private contractor. Three masked men ambushed the van, . smashing its windows with sledgehammers and punching the driver as he . was transporting inmates from the prison near Redditch to Stafford Crown . Court on Monday morning. An international manhunt has been launched for Anslow with police liaising with other UK forces, the UK Border Agency and foreign authorities. The search extends to all airports and railway stations. Anslow, also known as Skitz, has strong connections across the country, including London, as well as overseas, police said. A 44-year-old Tipton man arrested on Monday night on suspicion of helping Anslow to escape was released on bail pending further inquiries last night, police said.","Andrew Farndon, 26, 'stabbed himself' and was outside hospital when the raid took place .

"Canadian teenagers sent Lego man 80,000 feet up in the air . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:49 PM on 30th January 2012 . Aviation experts have warned space enthusiasts not to send helium weather balloons up into the sky - as one could be enough to bring down a plane. Last week two Canadian teenagers Mathew Ho and Asad Muhammad sent a Lego man into space using a home-stitched parachute and spare parts found on Craigslist. The 17-year-olds, from Toronto, made headlines after the two-inch astronaut clutching a Canadian flag attached to a helium weather balloon went 80,000 feet into the air - three times the height of a commercial jet's cruising altitude.

"By . Graham Smith . Last updated at 1:23 PM on 30th January 2012 . A judge has dismissed assault charges against the fiancée of a man accused of beating his seven-year-old son to death on Father's Day three years ago. Tiffany Hyman, 31, failed to intervene when Leslie Schuler allegedly inflicted a fatal attack on his son at home in Worcester, Massachusetts, in June 2009, prosecutors claim. She is still awaiting trial on charges of reckless endangerment and being an accessory after the fact. Earlier hearing: Tiffany Hyman (left) failed to intervene when Leslie Schuler (right) inflicted a fatal attack on his son in Worcester, Massachusetts, prosecutors claim . But a Superior Court Judge Richard T. Tucker last week ruled there is insufficient evidence to pursue assault charges against her. The boy, Nathaniel Turner, had come to Worcester from his home in Eufaula, Alabama, about a month before his death to spend the summer with his father. Schuler, 39, is accused of repeatedly beating Nathaniel, culminating in a brutal assault when he is alleged to have slammed the boy's head into a wall so hard it left a dent. Victim: Nathaniel Turner was seven when he was killed in 2009 . The boy was declared brain dead two days later. Schuler was originally charged with multiple counts of assault, but a murder charge was added when Nathaniel died after being removed from a hospital ventilator. The child had lived with his grandmother most of his life in Alabama. Both her and Nathaniel's mother have said Schuler pleaded with them to be a part of his son's life. Police have said Schuler told Nathaniel's family he hit his son to discipline him. Hyman is not thought to have struck the boy but could have intervened and stopped the abuse, detectives said. Schuler is charged with murder; two counts of assault and battery on a child causing substantial bodily injury; assault and battery on a child causing injury; three counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon; two counts of assault and battery; and a single count of reckless endangerment of a child. He denies the charges. Hyman has pleaded not guilty to charges of permitting an assault and battery on a child causing substantial injury; reckless endangerment of a child; and being an accessory, after the fact, to assault and battery on a child causing substantial injury. A trial date has not been set.","Tiffany Hyman 'failed to intervene'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:14 PM on 30th January 2012 . A long line of cars and trucks . collided one after another early yesterday on a dark Florida highway so . shrouded in haze and smoke that drivers were instantly blinded. At least . ten people were killed. When rescuers first arrived, they . could only listen for screams and moans because the poor visibility made . it difficult to find victims in wreckage that was strewn for nearly a . mile, police said. Authorities were still trying to . determine what caused the pileup south of Gainesville on Interstate 75, . which had been closed for a time before the accidents because of the . mixture of fog and heavy smoke from a brush fire that may have been . intentionally set. At least a dozen cars and six tractor-trailers were . involved, and some burst into flames. Scroll down for video . Deadly crash: At least ten are dead and many more injured after a multi-vehicle wreck on Interstate 75 at Paynes Prairie, Florida today . Steven R Camps of Gainesville said he . and some friends were driving home several hours before dawn when they . were drawn into the pileup. 'You could hear cars hitting each . other. People were crying. People were screaming. It was crazy,' he . said. 'If I could give you an idea of what it looked like, I would say . it looked like the end of the world.' Another traumatised driver, Donna Henry, recounted the . moment she hit the smoke: ‘We just hit it, and you couldn’t see . anything.' In an interview with the Sun, Ms Henry said she was driving home from a trip with her friends when they hit the . darkness. Her Toyota struck a guardrail, but she managed to pull off of . the road. From there, all she could do was listen. She placed a call with 911, but . during the call, she heard at least 15 cars colliding into each other . ‘from this side and that, north and south. It was bad,' she said. Photographs of the scene taken hours . later revealed an aftermath that resembled a Hollywood disaster movie. Twisted, burned-out vehicles were scattered across the pavement, with . smoke still rising from the wreckage. Haze: Firemen hose down a commercial carrier truck on Interstate 75 after the deadly accident . Destruction: Florida Highway Patrolmen inspect the damage from a multi-vehicle accident . Rescue workers: Firemen spray foam on a truck that was part of the pileup . Covered in smoke: The remains of several semi trucks smoke and fume at the side of the Florida highway . Cars appeared to have smashed into . the big rigs and, in one case, a motor home. Some cars were crushed . beneath the heavier trucks. Reporters who were allowed to view . the site saw bodies still inside a burned-out Grand Prix. One . tractor-trailer was burned down to its skeleton, charred pages of books . and magazines in its cargo area. And the tires of every vehicle had . burned away, leaving only steel belts. 'You could hear cars hitting each . other. People were crying. People were screaming. It was crazy. If I could give you an idea of what it looked like, I would say . it looked like the end of the world.' - Steven R Camps, of Gainesville . Before Mr Camps hit the fog bank, a . friend who was driving ahead of him in a separate vehicle called to warn . of the road conditions. The friend said he had just seen an accident . and warned Camps to be careful as he approached the Paynes Prairie area . just south of Gainesville. A short time later, Mr Camps said, traffic stopped along the northbound lanes. 'You couldn't see anything. People were pulling off the road,' he said. Mr Camps said he began talking about the . road conditions to a man in the car stopped next to them when another . vehicle hit the man's car. The man's vehicle was crushed under a . semi-truck stopped in front of them. Camps said his car was hit twice, . but he and another friend were able to jump out. They took cover in the . grass on the shoulder of the road. All around them, cars and trucks were on fire, and they could hear explosions as the vehicles burned. Wreckage: Two silver cars are crumpled nearly beyond recognition . Fatal: A state trooper looks at a Toyata Matrix, centre, which came to rest after being smashed into by a semi truck . Investigating: Officials work at the scene of the multi-vehicle wreck, inspecting this red vehicle with its front smashed from impact . 'It was happening on both sides of . the road, so there was nowhere to go. It blew my mind,' he said, . explaining that the scene 'looked like someone was picking up cars and . throwing them.' Authorities had not released the . names of victims Sunday evening, but said one passenger car had four . fatalities and a 'tour bus-like' vehicle also was involved in the . pileup. 'Our standard operating procedure is . to get the road open as quickly as possible but let's not forget we have . ten people who are not with us today. So we are going to take our time . assessing the situation.' - Florida Highway Patrol spokesman Lieutenant Patrick Riordan . At least 18 people were were being treated at Shands at the . University of Florida, said hospital spokeswoman Allison Wilson. A crash scene investigator told the newspaper that it will take some time to investigate each individual crash. All six lanes of the interstate – . which runs virtually the entire length of Florida – were closed most of . Sunday afternoon as investigators surveyed the site and firefighters put . out the last of the flames. The northbound lanes of I-75 were reopened around 5:30pm EST, but the southbound lanes remained closed. 'Our standard operating procedure is . to get the road open as quickly as possible but let's not forget we have . ten people who are not with us today,' said Lieutenant Patrick Riordan, . a Florida Highway Patrol spokesman. 'So we are going to take our time . assessing the situation.' It was not clear when the highway would fully reopen because part of the road melted, police said. Bird's eye view: An aerial of Interstate 75 south of Gainsville, Florida after the accident . At some point before the pileup, . police briefly closed the highway because of the fog and smoke. The road . was reopened when visibility improved. Riordan said he was not sure how much time passed between the reopening of the highway and the first crash. Traffic was being diverted much of Sunday onto U.S. 301 and State Road 27, Riordan said. A spokeswoman for the Florida Forest . Service, Ludie Bond, said the fire began Saturday, and investigators . were trying to determine whether the blaze had been intentionally set. She said there were no controlled burns in the area and no lightning. Bond also said the fire had burned 62 . acres and was contained but still burning Sunday. A similar fire nearby . has been burning since mid-November because the dried vegetation is so . thick and deep. No homes are threatened. Four years ago, heavy fog and smoke were blamed for another serious crash. In January 2008, four people were . killed and 38 injured in a series of similar crashes on Interstate 4 . between Orlando and Tampa, about 125 miles south of Sunday's crash. More . than 70 vehicles were involved in those crashes, including one pileup . that involved 40 vehicles.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:02 PM on 30th January 2012 . About 400 people were arrested in Oakland yesterday during a chaotic day of Occupy protests that saw demonstrators break into City Hall and burn an American flag. Police fired tear gas and used 'flash' grenades to disperse hundreds of people after some in the crowd threw rocks and bottles and tore down fencing outside a convention center. It was the most turbulent day of protests since November, when Oakland police forcefully dismantled an Occupy encampment. An exasperated Mayor Jean Quan, who faced heavy criticism for the police action last fall, called on the Occupy movement to 'stop using Oakland as its playground.' 'People in the community and people in the Occupy movement have to stop making excuses for this behavior,' she said. Clash: A policeman tries to evict Occupy Oakland protesters from the city Hall . Demonstration: Protesters on the steps of the City Hall burn a U.S. flag they found inside the building . Occupy Oakland demonstrators run over a fence in an attempt to escape from the police encirclement during the day-long protest . Authorities say protesters clashed . with police throughout the day, at times throwing rocks, bottles and . other objects at officers. The protests grew as the day wore on with an . estimated 2,000 demonstrators in the streets at one point. Most of the arrests came around 8pm, . when police took about scores of protesters into custody as they marched . through the city's downtown, with some entering a YMCA building, . according to officials. Many other demonstrators were . arrested earlier in the afternoon, after police said they threw rocks, . bottles and other objects at officers and tore down fencing. At about the same time police were . taking people into custody near the YMCA, about 100 police officers . surrounded City Hall, while others swept the inside of the building . looking for protesters who had broken into the building, then ran out of . the building with American flags before officers arrived. A masked Occupy Oakland demonstrator walks in a cloud of smoke from smoke grenades during an attempt to occupy the vacant Henry J. Kaiser Convention Center . Crackdown: Police used tear gas and flash grenades to try and disperse demonstrators after being hit by a stream of impromptu missiles . Arrest: Around 300 protesters were held by police after a day of widespread unrest in Oakland . Ms Quan said that at one point, many . forced their way into City Hall, where they burned flags, broke into an . electrical box and damaged several art structures, including a recycled . art exhibit created by children. More help from other police agencies . was also sent to Oakland, with busloads of Alameda County sheriff's . deputies arriving in the downtown area late Saturday. City Administrator Deanna Santana . said protesters pelted officers with bottles, metal pipes, rocks and . burning flares and police responded by deploying smoke, tear gas and . bean bag rounds. 'These demonstrators stated their . intention was to provoke officers and engage in illegal activity and . that's exactly what has occurred today,' Ms Santana said. The group assembled at a downtown . plaza yesterday morning, with demonstrators threatening to take over the . vacant Henry Kaiser Convention Center. The group then marched through . the streets, disrupting traffic. The crowd grew as the day wore on, with afternoon estimates ranging from about 1,000 to 2,000 people. A group of Occupy Oakland demonstrators climb a fence to escape arrest as riot police fought running skirmishes . Crowd: Thousands of people were estimated to have turned out for the Oakland demonstration . Response: Police were out in force in an attempt to prevent the demonstration from becoming violent . The protesters walked to the convention center, where some started tearing down perimeter fencing and . 'destroying construction equipment' shortly before 3pm, police said. Police said they issued a dispersal . order and used smoke and tear gas after some protesters pelted them with . bottles, rocks, burning flares and other objects. Most of the arrests were made when . protesters ignored orders to leave and assaulted officers, police said. By 4pm, the bulk of the crowd had left the convention center and headed . back downtown. The demonstration comes after Occupy . protesters said earlier this week that they planned to move into a . vacant building and turn it into a social center and political hub. They . also threatened to try to shut down the port, occupy the airport and . take over City Hall. In a statement on Friday, Ms Santana said the city would not be 'bullied by threats of violence or illegal activity.' Interim police chief Howard Jordan also warned that officers would arrest those carrying out illegal actions. A group of police officers arrest an Occupy Oakland demonstrator near Frank H. Ogawa Plaza during the day-long protest . Hostility: The situation escalated when demonstrators launched rocks and bottles at the police, who responded with non-lethal weapons . Activists: Those on the march were hoping to take over a vacant building as a permanent base . Oakland officials said that . since the Occupy Oakland encampment was first established in late . October, police have arrested about 300 people. The national Occupy Wall Street . movement, which denounces corporate excess and economic inequality, . began in New York City in the fall but has been largely dormant lately. Oakland, New York and Los Angeles . were among the cities with the largest and most vocal Occupy protests . early on. The demonstrations ebbed after those cities used force to move . out hundreds of demonstrators who had set up tent cities. In Oakland, the police department . received heavy criticism for using force to break up earlier protests. Among the critics was the mayor, Ms Quan, who said she wasn't briefed on . the department's plans. Earlier this month, a court-appointed . monitor submitted a report to a federal judge that included 'serious . concerns' about the department's handling of the Occupy protests. Tension was rising in Washington as well, where the National Park Service has said it will bar Occupy protesters in the nation's capital from camping in two parks near the White House where they have been living since October.That order, if carried out as promised on Monday, could be a blow to one of the highest-profile chapters of the movement.","Protesters break in to City Hall and burn U.S. flag found there .

His son rushed to his bedside as doctors battled to save his life . ‘Since leaving the series he has . triumphed on stage as Brian Clough in The Spirit Of The Man and had . recently played John in the enormously successful stage production of .

A massive security operation involving 1,000 police officers has been launched in Indianapolis as the city's first Super Bowl rolls into town this week. Super Bowl fever has already hit the city and 150,000 NFL fans are expected to descend on downtown Indianapolis in one of the most high-security events in the U.S. The city has invested millions of dollars to keep spectators safe, including most bizarrely the installation of 150 new manhole covers after a series of underground explosions. Fever: Police officers watch the crowd in Super Bowl village, Indianapolis, ahead of the big game on Sunday . Security: A guard stands at the side of a concert in the heart of Indianapolis as crowds continue to gather ahead of the Super Bowl . Officers at the event have been equipped with smartphones and other electronic hand-held devices to allow them to feed photos and videos to a new state-of-the-art operations centre on the city's east side. Police cruisers will be driven around a 44-block area in the heart of the city as backup, and officers from the FBI will also be scanning the crowd for signs of pickpocketing, prostitution or other trouble. The Super Bowl venue, Lucas Oil Stadium, will even be swept for nuclear threats as authorities leave nothing to chance.

Experience: Fans photograph Super Bowl rings on show at an NFL exhibition in downtown Indianapolis . Public Safety Director Frank Straub said: 'This is clearly bigger in terms of the amount of people who will be downtown over an extended period of time.' Indianapolis is used to hosting large sporting events - the Indianapolis 500 attracts more than 200,000 fans every year and the NCAA's men's Final Four basketball tournament has been held there six times since 1980. But its first Super Bowl poses some unique challenges. Under a security risk rating system used by the federal government, the Super Bowl ranks second just below national security events involving the president and the Secret Service, according to Indianapolis Chief of Homeland Security Gary Coons. Thrill-seekers: Fans climb a tower to have a go on one of four zip slides running through the Super Bowl Village in downtown Indianapolis and, right, one woman has to be rescued after her harness got caught .

Attraction: A young fan tackles a sprint challenge in the Super Bowl Village and, right, the stadium where Sunday's game will take place . The ratings are based on factors including international attention, media coverage, number of people the event attracts and visits by celebrities and foreign dignitaries. In comparison, the Indianapolis 500 ranks two levels below the Super Bowl. A series of explosions in Indianapolis Power & Light's (IPL) underground network of utility cables has caused concern over the safety of fans - with a dozen blasts since 2005 sending manhole covers hurtling through the air. The IPL has spent $180,000 installing new locking manhole covers in the Super Bowl village. The covers lift a couple of inches off the ground if an explosion takes place - enough to vent gas without feeding oxygen to magnify the blast. Special teams from the Department of Energy will sweep the stadium - normally home to the Indianapolis Colts - for nuclear terror threats and the new $18million communications centre has been opened in time for the lead-up to the big game.

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 9:29 AM on 31st January 2012 . A Republican politician has been charged with the 1979 murder of his 23-year-old lover - who he is accused of choking to death in her bed. Pennsylvania builder Gregory Scott Hopkins, 65, was arrested on Sunday after cold-case investigators linked his DNA to the killing of Catherine Janet Walsh, of Monaca. She was found by her father in her bed, bound and strangled with a bandana, on September 1, 1979, after he could not contact her over Labor Day weekend. Arrested: Gregory Scott Hopkins (left) is accused of murdering Catherine Janet Walsh (right) Beaver County prosecutors said police had found new DNA evidence on Walsh's nightgown, the white rope that bound her hands behind her back and the bed sheet that covered her body. The Bridgewater Borough councillor's defence lawyer James Ross said his client was innocent and added: 'We intend to fight (these charges) vigorously.' The criminal complaint, filed to District Attorney Anthony J Berosh, said Hopkins had admitted to being Walsh's lover when interviewed seven hours after she was found. But Hopkins, one of three Republicans elected to the council in 2010, denied he had killed her. And he said it had been a month since they had been intimate in her home. Berosh did not discuss a possible motive for the murder. And he did not say whether Hopkins had made a statement after being arrested at his Mulberry Boulevard home. But he revealed Hopkins had carried out construction work on one his alleged victim's houses. Bridgewater . Walsh's brother, Francesco Caltieri, 52 and living in Columbus, Ohio, told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that the arrest was 'the start of closure'. He said: 'Thirty-two years is a long time. Certainly there were a lot of times we thought (an arrest) would never happen. The heartbreak still comes back, (but) Janet will finally have closure.' The arrest has left the 850 residents of Bridgewater, which lies on the banks of the Beaver River, in shock. Tim Phillippi said: 'When I heard (about the arrest) on the news, it shocked me. I couldn't believe it. I always thought he was a real nice guy. I never in a million years would have thought this.' Rod Weaver, a neighbour, said Hopkins was 'always very friendly to me. I would see him in the backyard and he would say, 'Hi! How are you doing?' We never had any problems.' And Tony Dorazio, co-owner of Precise Automotive, said Hopkins 'has always been a good neighbour in the 26 years I've been here. Scott's always been friendly, very friendly. 'We borrow stuff off him, he plows (the parking lot) for us. I don't know that I've ever seen him angry. He always has a pretty cool head on his shoulders.' Walsh was said to be a popular but quiet girl at Monaca High School, from which she graduated in 1975. Sources said she married soon after high school, but then separated. In the process of divorce in 1979 she moved into a house on Indiana Avenue that her parents owned. She had no children, lived alone and was working for a Monaca refrigerator company.","Bridgewater Borough councillor Gregory Scott Hopkins, 65, detained .

"Morgan Mengel tried to have lover take the blame by pretending she had given birth to his twins . By . Paul Thompson . Last updated at 9:07 PM on 30th January 2012 . A wife went on trial today accused of goading her lover into killing her husband to avoid an expensive custody battle over their young children. Morgan Marie Mengel, 35, convinced 21-year-old Stephen Shappell to take part in her alleged murder plot to batter Kevin Mengel, 34, to death with a shovel in Chester County, Philadelphia. The jury will then hear how Mengel tried to persuade her lover to take the full blame for the murder by pretending she had given birth to his twins while in prison. Devious: Morgan Marie Mengel, 35, allegedly convinced her 21-year-old love to batter her husband to death with a shovel in Chester County, Philadelphia . Prosecutors plan to introduce letters in which Mengel allegedly asked Shappell to exonerate her from the murder as she had to bring up their children. Mengel described her labour and pregnancy and even the infants weight and eye colour to Shappell in a bid to convince him not to implicate her in her husband's murder. Shappell is set to be the star prosecution witness having already pleaded guilty to murder. Conned: Stephen Shappell, 21, buried Kevin Mengel behind his high school after having an affair with the man's wife . Mengel and Shappell started their affair after having met at the landscaping business Morgan ran with her husband. She is alleged to have first tried to poison her husband by putting liquid nicotine into his Snapple drink. When that failed, Shappell bludgeoned him to death with a shovel. Mr Mengel's body was buried behind the 21-year-old's former high school in June 2010. Doting father: Morgan Marie Mengel did not want to fight a custody battle with her husband Kevin (pictured) over their three children . Mengel is alleged to have sent text messages and even updated her husband’s Facebok page to make it appear that he had walked out on his family. Prosecutors say Mengel had been trying to make her husband 'vanish' for two years prior to his murder and in 2008 attempted to poison him with sleeping pills. Several witnesses were being lined up to say how Morgan Mengel hated her husband. She had also reportedly said divorce was not an option because she did not want a custody fight over their three children Mercedes, now 12, Kevin ten and six-year-old Billy. Battered to death: Morgan Mengel wanted to make the father of her three children Kevin 'vanish' and had previously tried to poison him .",Morgan Mengel tried to have lover take the blame by pretending she had given birth to his twins .

"By . Rebecca Evans and Larisa Brown . Last updated at 9:09 AM on 31st January 2012 . 'Somebody of substantial talent': Paediatrician Melanie Spooner died of heart failure after a 17-year battle with anorexia, an inquest was told . A talented doctor weighed less than four stone when she died after succumbing to the anorexia which had dominated her life. Cambridge-educated Dr Melanie Spooner, 30, had battled the eating  disorder since the age of 13 and was on long-term sick leave from her children’s hospital. After her weight plummeted to 3st 11lb, she suffered heart failure and was found dead by her parents at her flat in Woolwich, south-east London. Dr Spooner, who was awarded a first-class degree in Natural Sciences from Downing College, had also spent time working in  Borneo as a flying doctor. An inquest at Southwark Coroner’s Court yesterday heard that she suffered from depression and would rarely eat in public. She had been off work for 11 months from St Thomas’ Children’s Hospital when she died in September. Her parents Robert and Jane broke into her flat after they were unable to contact her. They found her body and a note in the kitchen expressing ‘messages of love to her family’, the court heard. Mr Spooner told the inquest that his daughter had ‘a very healthy childhood’ but had struggled with anorexia throughout her teenage years. ‘My wife helped her back to very good health at about the age of 18 when she went to university but there was the potential to slip up afterwards.’ The chairman of the Royal College of GPs, Dr Clare Gerada, examined Dr Spooner in October 2010. She told the inquest that Dr Spooner refused to speak to a psychiatrist as she preferred the help of her family and said she ‘did not want to be treated like a child’. Dominated by the disease: Dr Spooner had been off work for 11 months from her job at St Thomas' Children's Hospital at the time of her death in September . She added: ‘I didn’t weigh her because she didn’t want to be weighed, and she didn’t want to go into psychological issues in consultation.’ A post-mortem examination revealed that Dr Spooner died of cardiac arrhythmia – a heart condition commonly associated with anorexia. Recording a verdict of natural causes, coroner Dr Adela Williams said: ‘It is always sad when someone dies but worse so when the loss is of such a talented young woman. ‘Melanie was troubled ever since early adolescence by a devastating mental health problem, and that caused her to suffer severe weight loss and abnormal eating patterns. ‘My own impression from the evidence I’ve heard is that it dominated her life. She was clearly somebody of substantial talent, and I understand she was a talented paediatrician. ‘Clearly, in the context of her low weight, her employers became concerned about her. ‘Her weight, while very low indeed, did not further decrease. She was hoping to return to work and, had thoughts of going to work in Australia. ‘It is clear from the evidence I have heard that she had experienced lowness in mood, and her parents became aware of this before she died.’ Dr Spooner achieved the highest possible grades for her A-levels and won a long line of scholastic prizes while she studied at the Royal Free and University College Medical School. She was also chosen from 1,500 students to be awarded the bronze medal from the University of London after earning a distinction in clinical practice. In addition, she  coxed her university college men’s rowing crew, played clarinet for two university groups and volunteered for various charities. Her family, including her brother Simon, said in an obituary for  the British Medical Journal that she would be remembered as a ‘kind, generous, gentle and  caring physician, daughter, sister and friend’. They added: ‘She always made time for those who needed her, supported and encouraged those around her and amazed and inspired those who knew her.’","Disease 'dominated' Dr Melanie Spooner's life since 13 .

""This has an important symbolic meaning. We have arrived at the stage when we don't want to be vassals any more,"" said opposition activist Ilya Ponomaryov, who picked up hitchhikers with white ribbons in his purple sedan. 'We want to show our unity. This is very visible. This is preparatory work for February 4, when there will be even more people than on Sakharov Avenue,' Ponomaryov said, referring to the site of a December 24 rally that drew tens of thousands. Polls indicate Putin will regain the presidency, extending his rule for at least six more years, although he is under pressure to show he can ensure a fair win. He was president from 2000-2008 and is widely believed to have been holding Russia's reins for his protege, President Dmitry Medvedev. 'This has an important symbolic meaning.

Cars are a strong symbol not only of status but of personal freedom in Russia and the right to choice in a country where even ownership of a tiny Soviet-made Lada was a luxury in the communist era and foreign cars were virtually non-existent. The protests, provoked by widespread suspicions of fraud favouring Putin's ruling party in a December 4 parliamentary election, have revealed dismay among Russians. Middle-class city dwellers in particular feel they have no say in politics and that Putin's decision to return to the Kremlin was thrust upon them. 'We have to fight for our rights... We have to show our strength so that maybe people will see us and come to the February 4 protest,' said Nadezhda, 26, who works for a state TV station. Nadezhda, who declined to give her last name, said her station had told employees not to take part in Sunday's protest. 'I feel cheated by the vote,' Yevgeny Starshov, 23, a student at a state school of public administration, said of the parliamentary election.

He said: 'The father tried to explain to his son why he walked away, but to no avail.' The father later said: 'It's a very embarrassing situation to finally get to meet him again in the police station. I wanted to tell him not to follow a life of crime, but how could I?' The son said: 'I had seen this guy on the street but I didn't realize he was my father. But it doesn't matter, he's never done anything for me, he means nothing to me.'

"By . David Gardner and Lee Moran . Last updated at 8:08 AM on 31st January 2012 . Syrian security forces tried to smuggle President Bashar Assad's family - including his British-born wife - out of the country. Rebel forces claim Asma Assad, a graduate of King's College, London and a former investment banker, had tried to flee with her children. They were in a convoy which was also carrying the president's mother and cousin. Sources told Egyptian newspaper . Al-Masry-Al-Youm that 'a convoy of official vehicles was seen heading to . the airport in Damascus'. Scroll down to see video of yesterday's troop offensive... Fleeing: Asma (right), the wife of Syrian President Bashar Assad, and their two children, seven-year-old Karim (right) and nine-year-old Zein (left) are believed to have been caught trying to flee, it has been claimed . The convoy was intercepted by brigades of army defectors and, coming under heavy fire, turned back to the city's presidential palace. The claims come on the day that Syrian rebels blew up a key gas pipeline as violence against President Bashar Assad's regime continues to escalate and they inch closer to his Damascus seat of power. Opposition forces blew up the line near Telkalakh, close to the Lebanese border, this morning - causing more than 460,000 cubic metres of gas to leak and cutting off supply to the city of Homs. The attack is one of several since the Syrian uprising began in mid-March 2011 - and followed the killing of 61 people yesterday. Rebels: Men calling themselves members of the Free Syrian Army pictured standing guard in the Homs province town of Rastan . Escalation: Syrian rebels, pictured here in the Homs province, are inching closer and closer to Assad's seat of power in Damascus . Street battles are now raging 'on the . doorstep' of the capital, with activists saying today's death toll . already stands at 15, as rebels advance to just three miles away from the . beleaguered President's HQ. Asma Assad, 36, (pictured) grew up in Acton, West London where she was known as 'Emma'. She is the daughter of consultant cardiologist Fawaz Akhras and retired diplomat Sahar Otri, both Sunni Muslims, who moved from Syria to London in the Fifties so that her father, who is now based at the Cromwell Hospital and in Harley Street, could get the best possible education and medical training. Asma, who holds dual citizenship, British and Syrian, was educated at a Church of England school in Ealing before attending a private girls’ day school - Queen’s College, Harley Street. From Queen’s, where she achieved four A-levels, Asma went to King’s College London to read Computer Science and take a diploma in French Literature. She graduated with a First and, after six months of travelling, joined Deutsche Bank as an analyst in hedge-fund management. She then moved to the investment bank JP Morgan and worked in Paris and New York, as well as London. On family holidays back in Syria, she met Bashar. Then he, too, came to London to study ophthalmology, though he had to leave early to return to Syria after his elder brother Basil, who had been the heir, died in a car crash. Asma started seeing him in secret, resigning from JP Morgan just a month before the wedding without being able to explain the real reason. With her father, she has set up several London-based charities such as the Syria Heritage. Vogue has described her as ‘the freshest and most magnetic of first ladies’ and has topped French Elle’s ‘most stylish woman in politics’ list. In Damascus, Bashar and Asma now live in a flat with plate-glass windows and their three boys go to a Montessori school. Asma speaks four languages and her connections with France have led her to persuade the Louvre to help her open Syrian cultural attractions. To counter that advance, more than 2,000 Syrian troops, driving 50 tanks and dozens of armoured vehicles, stormed rebel areas near Damascus yesterday, shelling neighbourhoods under control of army dissidents. Cowering from mortars and machine guns, terrified families were sent fleeing on foot carrying bags of . their belongings. Suburbs and villages on . the eastern outskirts of the city, a . predominantly Sunni Muslim agricultural area known as al Ghouta where large anti-regime . protests have been held, were hit. Ein Tarma, just three miles away from the capital, was also targeted. The wide-scale offensive suggests Assad's regime is worried military defectors are closing in on the capital. Damascus has so far remained relatively quiet, while most other Syrian cities descended into chaos. Rebels have gradually inched closer . and closer to the capital over the past two weeks. Army dissidents have . become more visible, seizing several suburbs on the eastern edge of the . city. They have also set up . checkpoints where masked men wearing military uniform and wielding . assault rifles stop motorists and protect anti-regime protests. Observers say their presence so close to . the capital suggests the Assad regime may either be losing control or . setting up a trap for the fighters before going on the offensive. Ammar . Abdulhamid, a US-based Syrian dissident, wrote on his blog: 'The . current battles taking place in and around Damascus may not yet lead to . the unravelling of the regime. 'But . the illusion of normalcy that the Assads have sought hard to maintain . in the capital since the beginning of the revolution has surely . unravelled. 'Once illusions unravel, reality soon follows.' Rami . Abdul-Rahman, director of the British-based Syrian Observatory for . Human Rights, who relies on a network of activists on the ground, said: . 'There are heavy clashes going on in all of the Damascus suburbs. 'Troops were able to enter some areas but are still facing stiff resistance in others.' The latest increase in violence came as . Britain pushed for agreement on a United Nations deadline for . beleaguered Assad to step down in two weeks and end the bloodshed that . is tearing his country apart. The U.N. Security Council may vote as . soon as Wednesday on the resolution for Assad to hand over power to his . deputy and make way for a national unity government. Protests: An image grab taken from a video uploaded on YouTube shows Syrian anti-regime protesters waving the country's pre-Baath flag during a demonstration in Helfaya in the central Syrian province of Hama . Uprising: This image grab also shows the demonstration in Helfaya. Some 5,000 are reported to have been killed in clashes between rebels and government forces since the uprising began . British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said there was ‘very strong support’ for the move. But Russia and China – which issued a rare double-veto of a similar, slightly weaker resolution last October – have so far resisted any attempts to intervene in Syria. Up against it: Syrian President Bashar Assad could be offered a deal to step down to help end the uprising that has rocked the country for the past ten months and left 5,000 dead . The deaths over the weekend came the day after the Arab League suspended its monitoring mission in Syria because of the mounting violence. The Arab League’s recommendations, . which fall short of urging military intervention, form the basis of the . U.N. draft resolution introduced by Morocco. The . next step is a meeting of experts from the missions of the 15 countries . on the Security Council this afternoon. The draft gives Syria 15 days . to comply or risk the adoption of tougher measures. Britain, . along with France and Germany, are hoping that a briefing tomorrow . about the Arab League’s findings by Secretary-General Nabil el-Araby and . Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani will help . convince the Russians not to use their veto. Russia’s . U.N. envoy Vitaly Churkin said he couldn’t see the resolution being . passed as it stood, but added that negotiations would continue down to . the wire.

Sloot, calling herself his 'guardian . angel', has resigned from the case. Mary Hamer, from Lake City, Florida, wrote a bizarre resignation letter saying she accepted defeat in the case, which found him guilty of murder. Van der Sloot admitted to strangling Stephany Flores in May 2010 after she found out about his suspected involvement in the disappearance of U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway in 2005. 'I will fight no more': Dr Mary Hamer, 55, paid legal fees for convicted killer Joran van der Sloot - but has written a letter saying she has 'resigned' from his case . The 24-year-old killer was sentenced to 28 years behind bars earlier this month. Throughout the Peruvian case, divorced radiologist Hamer had protested his innocence and shelled out around $100,000 to cover his legal fees. The letter, obtained by Radar Online, is addressed to President Obama, Peruvian president Ollanta Humala, the Flores family and Natalee Holloway's mother Beth. It says Hamer 'accepts defeat' in the case, adding: 'The U.S. government & Peru have won the battle.' Killer: Joran Van der Sloot was found guilty of murdering Stephany Flores in 2010 after she found out about his suspected involvement in another disappearance . Victims: Flores, right, was strangled by van der Sloot after she found out about his suspected involvement in the disappearance of U.S. teen Natalee Holloway, left . 'I, Mary Hamer officially and formally am resigning from my spiritual . and civil rights advocacy work on behalf of Joran van der Sloot,' she writes. She . also voices her fears the killer will die of a drug overdose or be . murdered in jail, and that she will 'hold the Peruvian and US . governments responsible if Mr. van der Sloot dies during his 28 year . sentence'. Dear President Obama, President Humala, Beth Holloway, the Flores family, the Media & Joran Van der Sloot: . I, Mary Hamer officially and formally am resigning from my spiritual . and civil rights advocacy work on behalf of Joran van der Sloot. The U.S. government & Peru have won the battle. I lose. I accept defeat. I have fought fervently on behalf of Joran Van der Sloot with NO results. I have sacrificed my life’s savings & I am now poor. I have risked death threats. Joran did Not commit murder. Joran committed Manslaughter with Stephany Flores' provocation. Joran had PTSD Diminished Mental Capacity & He was in a state of Self-Defense from years of a destroyed Self-esteem. I will fight No more forever. Thank you. Respectfully & Humbly, Mary Hamer, M.D. U.S.A. She adds: 'I have sacrificed my life's savings and I am now poor. I have risked death threats.' The . letter re-iterates her belief that van der Sloot did not kill Flores, . rather he committed 'manslaughter with [her] provocation' after . suffering from 'years of destroyed self esteem'. It has previously emerged the killer had written to Hamer asking for more funds and claiming he . loved her. Hamer told Anderson Cooper in an . interview earlier this month she trusts van der Sloot and believes he is . innocent - and denied he is playing her. She said: 'I still don't know who killed Stephany Flores. There are too many unanswered questions.' She claimed that the only reason he confessed to killing Ms Flores was because he was scared for his family's safety. Van der Sloot was transferred to the . high security Piedras Gordas facility in Lima . after criticism conditions where he was being held were too . comfortable. He reportedly enjoyed access to girlfriends while there. Since then, he is said to have deteriorated after he was placed in solitary confinement. An insider told RadarOnline.com: 'His health has suffered and he is not doing well there. Joran blames the food and the water, he says that he is depressed and feeling weak all the time.' 'I will fight no more': In the letter, Dr Mary Hamer says she has spent her life savings on legal fees for the case and received death threats . 'Guardian angel': Van der Sloot had previously written to Hamer, who paid $100,000 towards his legal fees, asking for more funds and saying he loved her . Dr Hamer told RadarOnline.com: 'I am very worried about his deteriorating health. I am terrified and I feel powerless to help.' The Dutch citizen met Stephany Flores, 21, in a casino in Lima in May 2010. He took cash and credit cards from her before fleeing to Chile, where he was caught two days after her decaying body was found. He confessed to the 'cruel' murder, telling police he became enraged after she found out about his suspected involvement in the Holloway case.

"By . David Williams . Last updated at 6:41 PM on 10th January 2012 . Syrian President Bashar al-Assad vowed to strike against ‘terrorists’ with an iron fist today and blamed a foreign conspiracy for trying to destabilise Syria. As the mass uprising continued against his rule with security forces accused of shooting dead 10 people, the beleaguered Mr Assad derided the Arab League for its attempts to halt violence in the 10-month-old revolt against his rule. The president's 100-minute speech, his first public address since June, contained vague promises of reform, but no sweeping concessions that might split an opposition now determined to end more than four decades of domination by the Assad family. Heavy handed: Syrian President Bashar Assad today refused to step down and vowed to meet any further unrest with an 'iron fist' Keeping an eye out: Syrians across the country watched President Bashar Assad's address on television . And Mr Assad, 46, gave no hint that he was willing to relinquish the power he inherited on his father's death in 2000 promising : ‘I am not someone who abandons responsibility. 'I am in this position because of support from the people and if I leave it will be because of the desire of the people. ‘Our priority now is to regain security which we basked in for decades, and this can only be achieved by hitting the terrorists with an iron hand…we will not be lenient with those who work with outsiders against the country.’ The hardline speech came as Turkey, Syria’s neighbour and one time friend, warned of civil war and Israel said it is making preparations for the fall of Mr Assad and a flood of refugees into the captured Golan Heights. Contrast: Assad's speech came the day after anti-government protesters carried the coffin of Muhammad Khaled Al-Kaheel, who they say was killed during clashes in Damascus . Pro: Meanwhile, there is some support for Assad, as this girl demonstrates carrying a placard with his picture and the Arabic slogan 'We're all with you' In a scathing attack on the Arab . League, which has sent monitors to check Syria's compliance with an Arab . peace plan after suspending it from the 22-member body in November, he . said : ‘The Arab League has failed for six decades to take a position in . the Arab interest ... We should not be surprised.’ He said Syria would not 'close the door' to any Arab proposal that respected its sovereignty and unity. Syria death toll graphic . Syria, Mr Assad complained, was the target of a relentless foreign media campaign. Blaming unrest on ‘outside planning’, he said, ‘The outside now regrettably includes Arabs. ‘We will declare victory soon, Mr Assad said, raising fears the military crackdown was about to increase. ‘When I leave this post, it will be also based upon the people's wishes,’ he added. The address broadcast live from Damascus University was a clear message there would be no concessions and little was going to change despite international calls for sweeping reforms and Mr Assad to stand down. The United Nations said last month that more than 5,000 civilians have been killed since protests began last March with repeated reports of snipers cutting down men, women and children. Syrian authorities say they are fighting armed groups – there is evidence that army deserters have joined the opposition and are targeting government forces – and that around 2,000 members of their own security forces have been killed so far. Activists claimed Syrian security forces shot dead at least 10 people in an eastern city of Deir el-Zour yesterday despite the presence of the Arab observer mission in the area. Mr Assad’s approach to unrest, casting it as a foreign conspiracy and countering it with violent repression and hazy promises of reform, resembled that of other Arab leaders confronted by mass protests in the past year. Three have been toppled. Despite the persistent upheaval in Syria, in which insurgent attacks have begun to eclipse civilian demonstrations, Mr Assad's security forces seem to retain the upper hand. Mr Assad acknowledged some ‘wrong actions’ by the authorities but despite the high casualty toll, he denied any policy to shoot demonstrators. ‘There is no cover for anyone. There are no orders for anyone to open fire on any citizen,’ he stressed. Opposition officials dismissed the contents of the speech. ‘Bashar is completely removed from reality, as if he is talking about a country other than Syria,’ said a Syria-based activist who identified himself by his nickname, Abu Hamza, because of fear of reprisals. ‘After 10 months of bloodshed, he comes out and talks of a foreign conspiracy.’ Aftermath: A suicide bomber earlier this week killed at least 25 people and wounded dozens more in the al-Midan district in central Damascus . Investigation: Several riot shields were visible in a wrecked police bus behind this destroyed vehicle in the suicide blast earlier this week . Standing room only: Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have taken to the country's streets to demand the end of the current regime, such as during this protest at the end of December . Huge: The protest at the end of December was believed to be the biggest ever series of protests against President Bashar Assad . Burhan Ghalioun, head of the opposition Syrian National Council, warned that Mr Assad’s emphasis on restoring order meant he is ‘backing away from his own pledge to the Arab League plan.’ He described Mr Assad's speech as dangerous because he had ‘insisted on using violence against our people, considered the revolution a terrorist conspiracy and thus undercut any Arab or non-Arab initiative to find a political solution to the crisis’. Reviewing progress since the 165 monitors began work on December 26 – two were injured in protests last week, the Arab League said on Sunday Syria had only partly kept an agreement to stop violence, withdraw troops from cities, free prisoners, provide media access and open a political dialogue. Escalating: Anger is growing as tens of thousands continue to protest against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad . Anger: Clashes have broken out over the last 10 months between Syrian security forces and unarmed protesters . Many of Mr Assad's critics say the Arab monitoring mission has failed to halt the bloodshed and is only giving the authorities more time to crack down on protesters. The struggle in Syria, Iran's only Arab ally, has alarmed its neighbours: Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Israel and Iraq. Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, a former friend of Assad who has become one of his fiercest critics, warned yesterday : ‘The situation in Syria is heading towards a religious, sectarian, racial war, and this needs to be prevented.’ Meanwhile, Israel’s military chief, Lieutenant-General Benny Gantz, told a parliamentary committee yesterday : ‘Assad cannot continue to hold onto power…on the day that the regime falls, it is expected to result in a blow to the Alawite sect. We are preparing to take in Alawite refugees on the Golan Heights.' Israel should also prepare for the possibility that cornered authorities in Damascus could 'as a lifesaver ... act against us', the general added.","Bashar Assad insisted he still had his people's support .

British taxpayers have lost nearly £900million on the value of Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking group shares after Stephen Hester gave up his bonus as RBS chief. The share price of the two banks plummeted yesterday over fears that the backlash against bonuses would damage their performance. RBS chief executive Hester gave up his bonus of £1million following intense political pressure. The share price at Lloyds, whose chief executive has also turned down his bonus, dropped by 4.1 per cent, wiping £921million of its value. At RBS, share prices fell by 3.5 per cent, decreasing its value by £580million. As RBS is 83 per cent owned by the taxpayer and Lloyds 41 per cent, the share price drops equate to a fall of close to £900million. The news emerged as pressure inensified on other leading bankers to follow the example of RBS chief Hester and give up multi-million pound bonuses. As hundreds more RBS employees wait to hear what they can expect from a bonus pot of around £500million this year, Business Secretary Vince Cable called for a ‘sense of perspective’ in an age of austerity for most. RBS investment banking boss John Hourican remains in line for a salary and bonus of up to £5.9million. RBS has been urged to show restraint over the bonuses of other executives due in the next few weeks . The bank, along with Lloyds, is under pressure to show restraint over other executive bonuses due to be handed out soon. Labour leader Ed Miliband insisted yesterday that the row over Mr Hester’s bonus must not be a ‘one-off episode’ and called on the Government to reintroduce a specific tax on bankers’ bonuses and put a worker on the board of every firm to help set executive pay. Coalition tensions over the issue are threatening to burst into the open, with Liberal Democrats complaining last night that the Treasury ‘stonewalled’ for months over the issue of Mr Hester’s bonus.","RBS shares fall by 3.5 per cent, Lloyds by 4.1 per cent ."
"By . Rebecca English, Royal Correspondent . Last updated at 2:35 AM on 8th January 2012 . Controversial: The Countess of Wessex has accepted two lavish sets of jewels from one of the Arab region's most bloody regimes, it has emerged . The Countess of Wessex has accepted two lavish sets of jewels from one of the Arab region’s most bloody regimes. Sophie, wife of Prince Edward, was handed the fabulous ‘suites’ of gems in December by the Bahraini royal family. The jewels, revealed in a list of royal gifts obtained yesterday by the Daily Mail, provoked furious criticism. Former Foreign Office minister Denis MacShane said: ‘Given the appalling suffering and repression of the Bahraini people, it would be a fitting gesture for the Countess of Wessex to auction these trinkets and distribute the proceeds to the victims of the regime.’ Bahrain’s rulers have been accused of using brute force and torture to crush  last year’s pro-democracy protests which resulted in the death of more than 40 campaigners. The gifts to Sophie, handed over during an official pre-Christmas visit she made to the Arab kingdom on behalf of the Queen, throws an uncomfortable spotlight on the Royal Family’s close links with many hard-line rulers in the Middle East. The Crown Prince of Bahrain has been seen with the Queen in the Royal Box at Ascot and has hosted visits from both Prince Charles and Prince Andrew. He was invited to last year’s royal wedding but, after a public outcry, declined to attend to spare Kate and William embarrassment. Buckingham Palace refused to reveal any details of the jewels, apart from confirming their existence. But a suite of matching jewellery includes three or more pieces – usually a necklace, bracelet and earrings and then, possibly, a belt or a brooch. Visit: The Queen with The King of Bahrain, His Majesty Shaikh Hamad Bin Isa Al Khalifa in 2004. He gave one set of the jewels to The Countess of Wessex . It is not known how much the . countess’s gems are worth but when the Duchess of Cornwall was given . three suites – or parures – of jewellery by the Saudi royal family in . 2007 they were estimated to be worth more than £2million. Sophie, 46, spent a day in Bahrain with her husband following a morale-boosting visit to British troops in Afghanistan four days before Christmas. One set of jewels came from the king, Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, the other from the prime minister, Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman al Khalifa, who also happens to be the king’s uncle – and the only prime minister the country has ever had. And the generosity of the Bahraini ruling family did not end there. Bahrain's Shaikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa lavished The Countess of Wessex with priceless Arab jewels . For mother-of-two Sophie, who suffered public humiliation at the hands of the News of the World’s so-called ‘fake sheik’ when she boasted of her royal connections while running her own PR business – also received an exquisite silver and pearl cup from the country’s crown prince. He also gave her husband, the Earl of Wessex, a silk rug during an extravagant banquet at the King’s palace on December 21. Edward also accepted what are described as ‘a pen and a watch’ from the king. The uprising in Bahrain began in February last year, as part of the wider Arab Spring revolt. It . was suppressed with brutality by the country’s Sunni Muslim rulers . after protests from the Shia majority for greater political freedom and . equal treatment. More than 50 people have been killed and almost 3,000 detained and tortured, many of them ordinary civilians. Ann Clwyd, a member of the Commons . foreign affairs select committee, said: ‘The way the Bahraini government . has been arresting, imprisoning and torturing protesters is to be . condemned, and people need to be very careful of their links with the . Bahraini royal family.’ Labour . MP Paul Flynn said: ‘It is difficult to imagine what the justification . can be for something like this, and it looks like Bahrain is trying to . buy favours from us.’ The fundamental principle governing the acceptance of gifts by members of the Royal Family is that none should be accepted which would, or might appear to, place them ‘under any obligation to the donor’. Buckingham Palace guidelines state: ‘Before accepting any gift, careful consideration should always be given, wherever practicable, to the donor, the reason for and occasion of the gift and the nature of the gift itself.’ Campaigners have called on the Duchess of Cambridge to put pressure on one of her favourite High Street stores to improve the lives of its workers. Zara has been hit by a string of ‘slave labour’ scandals, and last month two workers died at a Bangladeshi factory which supplies the Spanish chain. Kate is regularly seen shopping at Zara and has worn two of the firm’s outfits on high profile public occasions since becoming a member of the royal family. The first was a cornflower blue dress worn the day after her wedding, and the second a black and nude lace dress she sported at a charity concert last month. Both sold out in hours, and the publicity was a huge coup for the firm. But it has been heavily criticised over standards in the factories used to produce its clothes. This week hundreds of workers took to the streets of Dhaka, in Bangladesh, demanding compensation for the families of victims of a blaze at the Eurotex factory in December. A spokesman for charity War on Want said Kate should ‘call on the British Government to enact legislation to protect overseas workers for UK retailers’. Zara was yesterday unavailable for comment, as it was a public holiday in Spain. In the past, it has said poor conditions had occurred in factories where work was outsourced.

As GOP figures come out to lambast Newt Gingrich's bid for presidency, the latest polls show Mitt Romney is bounding ahead of him in the polls - and looks set for a decisive victory in Floria. The former governor of Massachusetts leads by a staggering 15 points - 42 per cent compared to Gingrich's 27 per cent. Rick Santorum is third with 16 per cent, while Ron Paul trails with 11 per cent. 'The bottom line in all this is Romney's sitting in the driver's seat going into Tuesday,' said Lee Miringoff, from the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the poll with NBC. Scroll down for video . Support: GOP presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney is joined by his wife Ann (L), their son Craig (R) and grandson Parker (bottom) at a campaign stop in Hialeah, Florida today . Campaign trail: Romney (standing centre) rides his campaign bus from Naples to Hialeah, Florida today, with (from L-R) aide Charlie Pearce; adviser Eric Fehrnstrom; wife Ann Romney; adviser Beth Myers; Sheri Romney and brother Scott Romney . Showing support: Sen John McCain said that Mitt Romney should go to the White House and Newt Gingrich should go to the moon . Supporters: But there has been some good news for Gingrich, with less conventional Republican figures such as Herman Cain, left, and Chuck Norris announcing the are endorsing the former Speaker of the House . It comes as yet another blow to Gingrich, who has been slated by GOP heavy-weights, including John McCain and Glenn Beck, in recent days. However, there was one piece of good . news for the embattled presidential hopeful, as he received the endorsement of . maverick former candidate Herman Cain. Pizza magnate Cain, who quit the race . following allegations that he had sexually harassed several employees, . threw his support behind Gingrich at a GOP fundraising event. 'I . hereby officially and enthusiastically endorse Newt Gingrich for . president of the United States,' he said. 'I know he is going through . this sausage-grinder because he cares about the future of the United . States of America.' In . return, Gingrich told the crowd that he intended to appoint Cain to a . taskforce dealing with 'jobs, economic growth and taxes' if he becomes . President. The endorsement . comes as something of a surprise, given that Cain has already aimed to . be endorsing 'the people' - but out of the remaining candidates, it is . Gingrich who is closest to Cain's brand of conservative populism. Clash of the Titans: When asked if he thought . Newt Gingrich (left) had a shot at the White House, Sen Bob Dole (right) said: 'I hope not' The endorsement offers some relief for Gingrich, who has come under fire from top GOP figures. Everyone from former . presidential candidates John McCain and Bob Dole to Fox News pundit . Glenn Beck were of the opinion that Gingrich is not the right man for . the presidency. Former presidential candidate John McCain told reporters: ‘(Just) because someone debates well does not mean necessarily they would be a good president.’ He added: ‘I think we ought to send Newt Gingrich to the moon and Mitt Romney to the White House.’ Last Thursday, Bob Dole said in an interview that he hoped Gingrich doesn’t have a chance to become president. Sen. Dole also wrote in an open letter released by the Romney campaign that . he thinks Gingrich is a ‘one-man-band’ who would ‘have an adverse impact . on Republican candidates running for country, state, and federal . offices.’ Outspoken: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, left, called Gingrich an ‘embarrassment to the Republican party’ while Glenn Beck, right, said he ‘makes Nancy Pelosi look like a superstar’ Grandson of a president: Harrison Tyler, the 84-year-old son of President John Tyler, said that Gingrich is a 'big jerk' On Meet the Press, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie called Gingrich ‘an embarrassment to the Republican Party.’ He said the former speaker simply . does not have the experience necessary to run the Oval Office. ‘He’ll . never run anything,’ Gov. Christie said. The latest poll of Florida voters, taken by NBC and Marist, indicates Romney is on the road to an easy victory in the crucial state: . Mitt Romney 42 per cent . Newt Gingrich 27 per cent . Rick Santorum 16 per cent . Ron Paul 11 per cent . Undecided 4 per cent . The famously outspoken conservative . news pundit Glenn Beck was not shy about his feelings toward Gingrich, . calling him ‘the only candidate I cannot vote for.’ He also stated: ‘He makes Nancy Pelosi look like a superstar to the rest of the country.’ Even the grandson of tenth president . John Tyler had negative things to say about him. In an interview with . Politico, 84-year-old Harrison Tyler said Gingrich is 'a big jerk,' in . part due to his three marriages. 'He needs to stick with the same wife, that's what my mother taught me,' Mr Tyler said. But Gingrich, even as his numbers . fall, has supporters in high places. Walker, Texas Ranger star Chuck . Norris wrote a gushing endorsement for Gingrich, calling him ‘the best . man left on the battlefield who is able to outwit, outplay and outlast . Obama and his campaign machine.’ In . the column, written a day after the South Carolina primary, Norris also . said: ‘Rome is burning, and we need to appoint the best firemen . possible to rush in and put out her fury.’ Looking good: Mitt Romney's poll numbers look promising. He held a campaign rally at Eastern Ship Building in Panama City, Florida today . According to the Roll Call endorsement . tracker, Romney has the most major endorsements of the Republican . candidates, with 73 House members behind him. Gingrich, on the other . hand, only has 11 House endorsements. Ron Paul and Rick Santorum each have three, ABC News reports. The latest NBC poll shows Romney ahead of the rest of the field across many subgroups, including those who are liberal or moderate (49 per cent), make more than $75,000 a year (49 per cent), identify as 'conservative' (47 percent), and, in particular with women. Women said they preferred Romney by 47-26 per cent over Gingrich. Romney also leads with men at 38-29 per cent. Gingrich needs a Florida win to . solidify the frontrunner mantle he took on after his resounding victory . in the third nominating contests. 'If we win Florida, I will be the nominee,' Gingrich declared at a golf facility in Port St. Lucie. But in a simple ad titled 'History Lesson' -- a play on Gingrich's background as a historian -- Romney's campaign . showed footage of an NBC television anchor's news report the day . Democrats and Republicans found him guilty of ethics violations in 1997. 'Newt Gingrich, who came to power, after all, preaching a higher standard in American politics, a man who brought down another Speaker on ethics accusations, tonight he has on his own record the judgment of his peers, Democrat and Republican alike,' anchor Tom Brokaw says in the report, which makes up the entire ad.

The parents of a war hero killed by a speeding drink-driver said they were 'devastated' at the jail term handed to their son's killer. Gary Pedelty, 24, who had toured Iraq with the 3rd Battalion Yorkshire Regiment, was killed when drunken Richard Mail's car smashed into his in November 2010. But despite driving after five pints and speeding at 75mph on a 60mph road in Huddersfield, Mail was jailed for just four years, meaning he will be free in two. Tragic: Former solider Gary Pedelty, left, was killed after speeding drink-driver Richard Mail, right, ploughed into his car in Huddersfield 2010 . Mail, 38, will only serve half his sentence despite a court hearing how his father and a barmaid had confiscated his keys, only for him to take them back later and get behind the wheel. War hero Pedelty's parents, Kevin and Aletia, branded the jail term 'ridiculous' as their son's death has caused them 'unimaginable pain'. They said after the hearing at Bradford Crown Court: 'Gary was a war hero, he served for his country. 'This sentence is ridiculous. It only tells people they can go out and get drunk and they will be free in two years. What sort of a deterrent is that? It’s not long enough.' The court heard on Friday that Mail had drunk at least five pints of Stella Artois at a pub, where his father had put his car keys behind the bar. He managed to get his keys back after the barmaid who had served him finished her shift, and left the pub at about 5pm on November 22 2010. He later careered across a carriageway in Huddersfield, West Yorks and smashed into Pedelty's Mazda 323, pushing the soldier's car into a drystone wall which crushed him inside his vehicle. Shame: Mail, his face obscured by a hoodie, arrives at Bradford Crown Court last week to be sentenced . The court heard that father-of-two Mail, who was speeding at 75mph on the 60mph road in Huddersfield, West Yorks, did not plead guilty to the offence of causing death by careless driving while over the prescribed limit until days before his trial was due to start, which Jayne Beckett, prosecuting, said added to the 'suffering of Gary’s family'. Gary, from Meltham, West Yorks., was pronounced dead at the scene and Mail was taken to hospital with a a broken leg and eye socket where doctors found that his blood alcohol level to be one-and-a-half times over the legal limit. A police officer overheard him telling a family member: 'I was on the right side of the road. He must have been p***ed the little t**t.' Judge Colin Burn also handed Mail, who was also taking a prescription of 15ml of methadone each day, a three-year driving ban. He told him: 'I find there are two aggravating factors here. 'Firstly, that you drove in the face of warnings not to and secondly, that you were speeding. 'I think it’s clear to say that Mr Pedelty was a remarkable man who was an extremely fine individual. His death has caused untold hurt and bewilderment. You caused his death by having far too much to drink. 'In your case it clearly wasn’t helped by a daily dose of prescribed methadone. Then on top of that you got behind the wheel of your car. 'You ignored both your father and bar staff who tried to keep your keys after in their view you had consumed too much to drink. In your account that was five pints of Stella Artois, which is not in itself a weak beer.

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 3:43 AM on 28th January 2012 . A terrifying massacre carried out by Syrian President Bashar Assad's security forces killed more than 30 people. Activists said government troops fired on homes with mortars and machine guns yesterday - murdering women and children in the besieged city of Homs. Mourners burying an anti-government protester killed in Saqba today chanted 'better to die than be humiliated' as renewed violence today saw another 20 protesters killed. Massacre: Dead women and children are pictured laid out on the floor after they were murdered by Syrian security forces who fired on homes with mortars and machine guns . Protest: Demonstrators have been taking to Syria's streets in their thousands, such as in Khalidieh, near Homs, yesterday . Video of yesterday's massacre, posted online by activists, showed the bodies of five small children, five women of varying ages, and a man, all bloodied and piled on beds. It appears to be inside an apartment after a building was hit in the Karm el-Zaytoun neighbourhood of the city. A narrator said an entire family had been 'slaughtered'. Today heavy gunfire erupted for a second day in the city, which has seen some of the heaviest violence of the 10-month-old uprising against Assad's rule. Activists said at least 20 people were killed across the country, four of them in Homs. Elsewhere, a car bomb exploded at a checkpoint outside the northern city of Idlib, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, quoting witnesses on the ground. In an attempt to stop the bloodshed, the UN Security Council was to hold a closed-door meeting to discuss the crisis, a step toward a possible resolution against the Damascus regime. Uprising: Syrian soldiers who defected to join the Free Syrian Army are seen among demonstrators during a protest against Assad near Homs . Violence: The UN says at least 5,400 people have been killed in the government crackdown since March, and the turmoil has intensified as dissident soldiers have joined the ranks of the anti-Assad protesters . The UN says at least 5,400 people have been killed in the government crackdown since March, and the turmoil has intensified as dissident soldiers have joined the ranks of the anti-Assad protesters. Details of yesterday's wave of killings in Homs were emerging from residents and activists. Rami Abdul-Rahman, director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, called for an independent investigation as he said: 'There has been a terrifying massacre.' Crackdown: Syrian President Bashar Assad . The day started with a spate of sectarian kidnappings and killings between the city's population of Sunnis and Allawites, a Shiite sect to which Assad belongs and which is the backbone of his regime, said Mohammad Saleh, an opposition figure in Homs. There were also a string of attacks by unknown gunmen on army checkpoints. The violence culminated with the evening killing of the family, Saleh added. The Observatory said 29 people were killed, including eight children, when a building came under heavy mortar and machine gun fire. Some residents spoke of another massacre that took place when shabiha - armed regime loyalists - stormed the district, slaughtering residents in an apartment, including children. 'It's racial cleansing,' said one Sunni resident of Karm el-Zaytoun. The death toll in Homs city was at least 35, said the Observatory and the Local Co-ordination Committees, an umbrella group of activists. Iran's official IRNA news agency also said gunmen in Syria had kidnapped 11 Iranian pilgrims travelling by road from Turkey to Damascus. Iranian pilgrims routinely visit Syria - Iran's closest ally in the Arab world - to pay homage to Shiite holy shrines. UN rights chief Navi Pillay, speaking at the Davos Forum in Switzerland, expressed 'great concern that the killings are continuing and in my view it's the authorities who are killing civilians, and so it would all stop if an order comes from the top to stop the killings'. Assad's regime claims terrorists acting out a foreign conspiracy are behind the uprising. International pressure on Damascus to end the bloodshed so far has produced few results. The Arab League has sent observers to the country, but the mission has been widely criticised for failing to stop the violence. Gulf states led by Saudi Arabia pulled out of the mission. The UN Security Council has been unable to agree on a resolution since violence began in March because of strong opposition from Russia and China. A senior Russian diplomat said Moscow will oppose a new draft United Nations resolution on Syria because it fails to take Kremlin's concerns into account.","30 dead as troops fire on homes in Homs with mortars and machine guns .

"By . Ray Massey . Last updated at 9:57 AM on 31st January 2012 . Thousands of militant Tube workers yesterday rejected a £500 bonus to  simply do their jobs  during the Olympics. Union bosses insisted it was not an ‘adequate reward’ for 14,000 staff including drivers, station and ticket staff,  signallers and engineers. The RMT, led by Bob Crow, was accused of holding London Underground and Olympic chiefs to ransom after talks on the payment ended in disagreement. Tube workers have rejected the latest offer of pay for not going on strike during the Olympics . The breakdown sabotaged the VIP launch of a campaign to persuade spectators and commuters that the capital’s transport system can cope with the huge demands of the Games. The bonus would come on top of £1,200 extra already earmarked for 3,500 Tube drivers for working different and longer shifts during the Olympics. And all Underground workers are getting a generous four-year general pay deal. This will leave the average driver’s annual salary at more than £50,000 for a 35-hour week with more than eight weeks of holiday. General Secretary of the RMT Bob Crow says his union just wants 'a fair deal' Former Transport Minister Stephen Hammond MP said: ‘The unions should not hold London to ransom during the Olympics as millions of people struggle during these difficult economic times.’ Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, added: ‘The Olympics has cost enough without the threat of Tube drivers holding the capital and the Games to ransom.’ The controversial bonus is an annual payment based on  customer surveys. Both the RMT and bosses agree it should be higher this year to reward the ‘additional effort’ of staff, but cannot agree by how much. The rejected amount, claims the union, is made up of £100 for meeting ‘unspecified and  arbitrary’ targets. The remaining £400 is based on £20 per shift over the month-long  event, when millions of extra people will use the transport system. But the hard-line union objects as those on leave or off sick would receive ‘less or nothing’. It also claimed: ‘There is no reward for the increased workload taken on by staff.’ RMT chiefs are also angry that: ‘This offer does not reward staff for the work during the run-up to the Games.’ General secretary Mr Crow said the union would continue to press for an across-the-board payment to all staff. ‘All we are calling for is a fair deal for all the staff involved in delivering the colossal  transport challenge that we will be facing this summer,’ he insisted. Transport for London boss Peter Hendy said the breakdown in talks was ‘a tactic’. He added: ‘We will get a deal with the RMT. Our staff are going to be very proud to do this.’ Let the Games commence: The deal would cover a period of almost nine weeks during the Olympics and Paralympics . Other transport workers are also cashing in on the Games. Just days ago, workers on the Docklands Light Railway were given a deal worth up to £2,500 to work up to five hours of  guaranteed overtime per week  during the event. More than 500 staff on the London Overground are also getting a bonus of at least £600. The latest dispute threatened to overshadow the high-profile drive to boost public confidence that London’s transport network will cope with the huge demands of the Olympics. London's Transport Commissioner Peter Hendy has suggested people should ‘go for a beer’ to help space out their journeys at peak times during the Olympics. He was speaking as a publicity campaign was launched today to try to help people navigate London’s public transport system during the Games. There is information available online of the 30 busiest stations and where ‘in theory’ people could be waiting for half an hour, he pointed out. Mr Hendy said: ‘With a bit of forethought and care about when you use the transport system at a very busy time it will all work out alright. ‘I have never seen anyone in a Tube station for half an hour - go for a beer. 'We are on track but still have an awful lot to do. We have got to get the athletes to the Games but we also have to keep the city moving.’ The campaign also suggests other options for people, such as working at different times or locations, teleconferencing rather than travelling to meetings, or alternative modes of transport including walking and cycling where practical. Those involved included Transport Secretary Justine Greening, London Mayor Boris Johnson and Lord Coe, head of Olympics organisers Locog. Mr Hendy said: ‘We’re not saying it will all run perfectly. We’re trying to make it run as well as we can. It’ll be all right. ‘You don’t need to sit under the table with a tin hat on and tins of beans for the duration.’ He hit back at what he called the Olympics ‘gloom-mongers’ and urged commuters to help by staggering train journeys by going ‘for a beer’ after work. Mr Johnson urged ‘Olympic fat cats’ to ‘get on their bikes’ or use the Tube to get around. On the bonus dispute, he appealed to train workers’  better nature, adding: ‘The majority will want to participate in a great Games.’ Miss Greening said: ‘I urge the unions to agree an early resolution of this dispute so Londoners, visitors and businesses are provided with the service they need during this once-in-a-life-time sporting celebration.’","RMT urges staff to hold out after DLR staff agreed a deal under which they will get up to £2,500 ."

Thousands of people queued for a rare opportunity to see a unique set of canal locks as they were drained for vital repair work. The novelty of viewing the steepest locks in Britain from the rare vantage point of the canal bed pulled in over 7,000 people at the weekend. British Waterways were replacing four of the six giant gates on the famous Five Locks Rise in Bingley, West Yorkshire, in a £200,000 job that takes place every 25 years. Steepest in Britain: Visitors are shown around the famous Five Locks Rise in Bingley, West Yorkshire, from the unique vantage point of the canal bed after it was drained for renovation work . People have been visiting the locks on the Leeds-Liverpool Canal for more than 230 years and this weekend 7,276 had visited by Sunday afternoon, a spokesman said. He added: 'It’s been a fantastic response, everyone has had an amazing time and it just shows what passion there is out there for the waterways. 'They are the steepest locks in Britain at 60ft from top to bottom.' A crowd of about 30,000 people turned out to celebrate when the locks were opened in 1774. Carpenter Russell Clarke, who is responsible for putting in the new lock gates, said: 'The engineering that went into it was amazing. We’re in awe of what went on. 'I think if you asked us to build a lock like this now we would just stand there and scratch our heads.' Having a lock around: The £200,000 project to replace the huge gates takes place every 25 years . Mr Clarke said the lock gates weighed more than five tonnes when installed, adding that the most unusual thing he had found when the locks were drained was a child’s tiara. 'We do find other things like wallets, mobile phones, frying pans, anything that people carry on boats,' he said. Vince Moran, operations manager at British Waterways, said: 'The winter period from November through to March is what we call the stoppage season. 'That’s when we do most of our maintenance and repair work on the 200-year-old canal system. 'So we’ll be replacing over this winter about two hundred sets of lock gates.' Visitor Damien O’Keeffe, from Bingley, said he and his five-year-old daughter were impressed with the sheer scale of the locks. 'This was real living history,' he said. 'A chance to really walk in the footsteps of all the navvies and labourers whose sweat and blood built this country,' he said. 'The opportunity to actually walk through the drained locks was too good to miss.'","Thousands descend on Five Locks Rise in West Yorkshire to take in view from canal bed .

The growing power of a rebel army has seen control of the Syrian capital of Damascus split between rival gunmen fighting for or against President Bashar Assad. Two days of bloody carnage in which at least 74 people have died has come as the rebel force - the Syrian Free Army - steps up its mission to take control of the streets from government forces. 'We had a big battle here earlier this month,' a Damascus schoolteacher, who did not want to be identified for fear of reprisals, told The Times. No go area for government soldiers: A Syrian soldier, who has defected to join the Free Syrian Army, brandishes a rifle and waves a Syrian independence flag in the Saqba istrict of Damascus .

Checkpoint: A soldier from the Free Syrian Army secures a street as the rebel force closes off sections of the Damascus to government soldiers . 'For the past 11 days this has been free Syria. All they can do now is cut the electricity and the water an disrupt the phone. It just goes to show how weak they are.' The head of Arab League observers in Syria said in a statement that violence in the country has spiked over the past few days. Sudanese General Mohammed Ahmed al-Dabi said the cities of Homs, Hama and Idlib have all witnessed a 'very high escalation' in violence since Tuesday. A 'fierce military campaign' was also under way in the Hamadiyeh district of Hama since the early hours of Friday, according to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and other activists. However, the rebel surge has caused a spike in deaths that has claimed the lives of women and children as well as soldiers. In the besieged city of Homs forces loyal to President Bashar Assad shelled homes and fired on crowds with machine guns in a dramatic escalation of violence yesterday, according to activists. Massacre: The bodies of families that were killed during the bombing in Homs . Martyr: Syrians carry the coffin of Mazen abou Dhahab who was killed in a protest in Damascus . Running for their lives: This still image grabbed taken from a video uploaded on YouTube shows Syrians fleeing attack in the southern city of Daraa yesterday after fighting broke out at a funeral .

It appears to be inside an apartment after a building was hit in the Karm el-Zaytoun neighbourhood of the city. A narrator said an entire family had been 'slaughtered'. The Syrian uprising, which began last March with mostly peaceful protests, has become increasingly violent in recent months as army defectors clash with government forces and some protesters take up arms to protect themselves. The violence has inflamed the sectarian divide in the country, where members of Assad's Alawite sect dominate the regime despite a Sunni Muslim majority. Veto: An anti-regime demonstrator holds up a poster of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin . Some residents spoke of another massacre that took place when shabiha - armed regime loyalists - stormed the district, slaughtering residents in an apartment, including children.

The Arab League has sent observers to the country, but the mission has been widely criticised for failing to stop the violence. Gulf states led by Saudi Arabia pulled out of the mission. The UN Security Council has been unable to agree on a resolution since violence began in March because of strong opposition from Russia and China. Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said that the text introduced by new Arab Security Council member Morocco has 'red lines' for Moscow, but he's willing to 'engage' with the resolution's sponsors. Anti-Russian sentiment is running high among rebel fighters because they believe Putin's government is preventing regime change in Syria, reviving Assad, as pictured in this creative protest banner . Churkin said those lines include any indication of sanctions, including an arms embargo. 'We need to concentrate on establishing political dialogue,' he said. Russia's discomfort with the wording of the resolution could be resolved if the document clearly rules out military intervention, said Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of the journal Russia in Global Affairs. But he said Western and Arab states were unlikely to dismiss the use of force entirely, which will not satisfy Moscow. With Arab states such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar determined to get Assad out of power and Russia opposed, he said, 'I cannot really see some resolution that could be agreed by all. 'This is not Libya, it's a completely different situation.'",The Arab League halted its observer mission to Syria because it has become too dangerous .

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 6:05 AM on 1st February 2012 . Federal investigators have concluded that Air Force officials at the military mortuary in Dover, Delaware, illegally punished four civilian workers for blowing the whistle on the mishandling of body parts of dead troops. The Office of Special Counsel said in a report released on Tuesday that they have recommended to the Air Force that it discipline the three officials who allegedly retaliated against the whistle-blowers. The three were not identified by name. It said one is an active-duty military member and the other two are civilians. Air Force Secretary Michael Donley said in a statement that he has appointed a two-star general to review the findings and take 'appropriate action'. Donley said reprisals against whistle-blowers are unacceptable. Speaking out: Dover Air Force Base employees (L-R) Mary Ellen Spera, a mortuary inspector, James Parsons, an embalming/autopsy technician, and Bill Zwicharowski, a senior mortuary inspector, alleged that they suffered retaliation for their disclosures . Donley said he and the Air Force's top officer, General Norton Schwartz, 'believe strongly there is no place for reprisal in the Air Force. Reprisals against employees are unethical and illegal and counter to Air Force core values.' In an earlier investigation report released last November, the Office of Special Counsel said it had found 'gross mismanagement' at the Dover facility, where small body parts of U.S. troops killed in Afghanistan were lost on two occasions. The Air Force said at the time that it took disciplinary action - but did not fire - three senior supervisors there for their role in the mismanagement. The reprisal accusations were a separate matter and were investigated by the Special Counsel under the Whistleblower Protection Act. The three disciplined in connection with the earlier Special Counsel included Air Force Colonel Robert Edmondson, who commanded the Dover mortuary at the time of the incidents, and two civilian supervisors - Trevor Dean and Quinton Keel. Air Force Base: In an earlier investigation report released last November, the Office of Special Counsel said it had found 'gross mismanagement' at the Dover facility . Mishandling: Small body parts of U.S. troops killed in Afghanistan were lost on two occasions, according to investigators . Edmondson was given a letter of reprimand, denied a job commanding a unit at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina, and barred from future command assignments. Dean and Keel took a cut in pay and were moved to nonsupervisory jobs at Dover. All three have declined to comment publicly on the matter. Although the names of the three accused of retaliating against the whistle-blowers were not made public, two officials said they are Edmondson, Dean and Keel. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of privacy restrictions. The Air Force did not immediately respond to a request to seek comment from the three accused men. Scene: An 18-month probe into Dover's mortuary determined the negligent practices . Representative Rush Holt, D-New Jersey, who wrote to Defense Secretary Leon Panetta last September inquiring about alleged problems at Dover, before the loss of body parts was made public, said on Tuesday that Donley should fire those who retaliated against the whistle-blowers - 'if he hasn't already.' Panetta expressed deep disappointment in . the Dover revelations last November, and he ordered Donley to report . back to him on whether stronger disciplinary actions were warranted. Donley said Tuesday that he is still working on that assessment. Panetta also appointed a retired Army . general, John Abizaid, to lead an independent assessment of actions . taken to improve mortuary operations at Dover. Navy Captain John Kirby, a . Pentagon spokesman, said Panetta has discussed the matter with Abizaid . twice and expects him to report his group's findings by the end of . February. The four . whistle-blowers had alleged that they suffered retaliation for their . disclosures, including job termination, indefinite administrative leave . and five-day suspensions. James . Parsons, one of the whistle-blowers, said on Tuesday that he had not seen . the investigators' report but was told Monday that its conclusions . support his and the others' claims of retaliation. Parsons . is an embalming/autopsy technician. Two of the other whistle-blowers . are Mary Ellen Spera, a mortuary inspector, and William Zwicharowski, a . senior mortuary inspector. Those three told The Associated Press last . November, after the scandal broke, that the Air Force had retaliated . against them. Parsons said he was fired in 2010 but reinstated almost . immediately. Spera and Zwicharowski said they received letters of . reprimand. Zwicharowski also said he was put on administrative leave for eight months and at one point was labeled 'mentally unstable.'

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 11:54 PM on 31st January 2012 . Iran is likely to launch terrorists attacks on US soil if the isolated Islamist regime feels threatened, American intelligence officials believe. Citing last year's thwarted Iranian . plot to kill the Saudi ambassador in the US, 'some Iranian officials — . probably including Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei... are now more willing . to conduct an attack in the United States in response to real or . perceived U.S. actions that threaten the regime,' Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told the Senate Intelligence Committee Tuesday. Officials also asserted that Iran has the means to build a nuclear weapon but has not yet decided to follow through, in contrast to Israel's insistence that time is running out to stop Iran from developing such a weapon. Threat: James Clapper told Congress Tuesday that he thought Iran could launch terrorist attacks against the US . Iran has the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon, Clapper said. But he, CIA Director David Petraeus and others reasserted their stance that Iran is not building nuclear weapons, in subtle contrast to Israeli officials' statements that Iran could have nuclear capability within a year. 'There is dissension and debate in the political hierarchy of Iran' over whether to build a weapon, Clapper said. 'There is not unanimity about this' as Iranian political officials weigh the regional prestige they believe they may gain by possessing a weapon against the cost of further international sanctions and the risk of retaliatory military action by Israel or the West. Petraeus said the latest round of sanctions against the regime is beginning to bite, with a run on Iranian banks in recent weeks, but he conceded that the 'clock is ticking' as Iran moves ahead enriching uranium to a grade that's below weapons-ready, but higher than normal for regular industrial use. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said in an interview aired this week that the Iranians could build a bomb quickly. Tensions high: The USS Abraham Lincoln was one of several US warships that traveled the Straight of Hormuz during a standoff with Iran . 'If they decided to do it, it would probably take them about a year to be able to produce a bomb and then possibly another one to two years in order to put it on a deliverable vehicle of some sort in order to deliver that weapon,' Panetta said Sunday on CBS' '60 Minutes' program. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said last week that Iran is proceeding toward nuclear weapons capability and time is 'urgently running out.' Petraeus said he met with the head of Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad, last week to discuss Israel's concerns. While he said Israel sees the threat of an Iranian nuclear weapon as 'an existential threat to their country,' he did not say whether Israel agreed with the US assessment that Iran had not yet decided to make a nuclear weapon. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein called 2012 'a critical year for convincing or preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.' The threat of Iran lashing out as it ponders building nuclear arms is one of a potent mosaic of interconnected enemies facing the US, including terrorists, criminals and foreign powers who may try to strike via nuclear weapons or cyberspace, Clapper and the others said. Al-Qaida continues to be a major threat, though it is far weaker since Osama bin Laden's death at the hands of Navy SEALs in Pakistan last year. Petraeus pointed out that 'four of the top 20 in a single week were captured or killed' last year, leaving the leadership struggling to replace itself. Clapper said the group likely will have to resort to 'smaller, simpler attacks' as its ranks are thinned by continued pressure from U.S. drone strikes and special operations raids. The intelligence chiefs predicted al-Qaida's regional affiliates, such as Yemen's al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, will try to pick up the slack for the beleaguered core group in Pakistan. The US continues to put pressure on the Yemeni offshoot, and on Monday mounted airstrikes targeting al-Qaida leaders there, killing at least four suspected militants, according to Yemeni and military officials. Just below Iran and al-Qaida on the list of threats comes the possibility of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, from chemical and biological to nuclear and radiological. The intelligence community does not believe states that possess them have supplied them to terror groups, but that remains a risk, Clapper said.","Director of National James Clapper told Congress Iranian leaders are considering attacks against the US .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Last updated at 11:16 PM on 31st January 2012 . Two former Syracuse ball boys filed a suit saying that both the wife of the team's former assistant coach Bernie Fine and another coach’s wife regularly had sex with players. Accuser Bobby Davis, 40, has previously said that Laurie Fine initiated sex with him when he was 18 years old, but in the latest court filing, he goes a step further and says that it was well-known that she had sex with a number of basketball players while her husband worked as one of their coaches. She was also heard talking with the wives of other assistant coaches about performing oral sex on the boys, as well as evaluating their 'specific size and physical attributes'. Telling it all: Bobby Davis (right) recorded his conversation with Laurie Fine (left) when she said that she knew Bernie molested boys but she didn't do anything, and Davis just detailed her sexual history in the affidavit . Mr Davis details a number of Mrs Fine’s affairs with the students in an effort to show that it was commonly known that players were sleeping with the coaches’ wives throughout Jim Boeheim’s tenure as head coach. Apparently Mrs Fine's relationships evolved in a similar pattern with each young man, as she would begin by paying them special attention and doing them favors like washing their laundry or lending them her car. She also gave them money and jewellery, and turned their special bond into 'an intimate relationship'. Mr Davis tells the specific stories of Mrs Fine’s trysts with four unidentified players- not including his own personal sexual encounter with her- in which he would drive Fine to the players’ campus housing units. In the first assignation listed in the affidavit, Mr Davis drove Mrs Fine to Player 1’s house and he saw her go into his dorm room. Mr Davis ‘later saw Player 1 come out fist-pumping the air and bragging about how he had just had sex with Laurie.’ Fired: Bernie Fine was fired in November after recordings were released that said he molested a number of his former players . This is just the first of four specific relationships that Davis describes in the affidavit, and he says it was common knowledge that the coaches wives were not off-limits for the basketball players. 'Players used to joke openly about it as a . known fact - that Laurie Fine gave (good oral sex) and was great in . bed, and that anyone could 'do the coach's wife,’ The New York Post . reports regarding the affidavit. Mr Davis ‘later saw Player 1 come out fist-pumping the air and bragging about how he had just had sex with Laurie’ -according to the affidavit . Mr Davis continues by saying how often he would drove Mrs Fine and another- unidentified- coaches’ wife to a student housing unit where at least two players lived, who are called Player 2 and Player 3 in the court records. During the car rides, the two women discussed different players’ sexual preferences, and evaluated their respective partner’s physical attributes. Though Mr Davis never explicitly knew that Mrs Fine had a sexual relationship with the final young man, Player 4, though he believes that she did ‘because of the way she acted with him’. In spite of all the focus on Mrs Fine in the filing, the true target of the lawsuit is Coach Boeheim. The drama started when assistant coach . Bernie Fine, 66, was fired in November after ESPN released a taped . conversation it had obtained between Mr Davis and Laurie Fine in which . Laurie said that she knew that her husband molested his players but she . did not do anything about it. Drawn in: The lawsuit charges Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim (pictured) with defaming Bernie Fine's accusers by calling them money-seeking liars . The two accusers in this suit- Mr Davis and his stepbrother Michael Long- say they were forcibly touched multiple by Bernie Fine in the 1980s. Syracuse administrators immediately fired . Bernie Fine in November after ESPN released the nearly decade-old . tapes, but Mr Boeheim publicly defended his former assistant, saying . that his accusers were liars and simply bringing the topic up to make . money. 'Players used to joke openly about it as a . known fact - that Laurie Fine gave (good oral sex) and was great in . bed, and that anyone could 'do the coach's wife,’ -according to the affidavit . 'I believe Boeheim deliberately chose to ignore what he knew was improper behavior, or actually knew precisely what was happening and did nothing to intervene,' Mr Davis writes in the affidavit. By bringing the widespread nature of . the rumors about Laurie Fine's sexual activities with players into the . legal field, the accusers are undoubtedly hoping to discredit Mr . Boeheim's defense that he did not know about the sexual abuse that was . going on. Because Mr Davis . and all of the other players mentioned were 18 years old when they had . sex with Laurie Fine, she cannot be accused of statutory rape. 'It is not only Fine’s relationship with . me and other boys that would have tipped Boeheim off. For years, Bernie . Fine’s wife Laurie Fine had sexual relationships with basketball team . players. Players used to talk openly about it as a known fact,' the . affidavit continues. New focus: Her husband was the original focus of the police investigation, as they are seen going through Bernie Fine's bags, but now the relationship Laurie Fine (left) had with players is cause for concern . Another controversy surrounding the suit is the location of the inevitable trial. Gloria Allred, the lawyer for the accusers- Mr Davis and his stepbrother Michael Lang- filed the defamation suit in New York State Supreme Court which is in Manhattan. Mr Boeheim wants the trial to take place in Onondaga County upstate, which is where he lives. The accusers fear that there is too much support for the Syracuse coaches there and if the trial were to take place in the school's backyard, they feel they would not be given equal treatment.","Disgraced former assistant coach Bernie Fine was fired by Syracuse University amid molestation charges in November .

"By . Suzannah Hills . Last updated at 2:11 PM on 27th January 2012 . A young mother is lucky to be alive after the sore arm doctors diagnosed as tennis elbow was in fact a deadly flesh eating bug. Kate White, 32, thought she'd suffered a bad reaction to an insect bite after she spotted a tiny pus-filled boil on her left elbow. But when it refused to heal she went to the A&E department at Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham and was diagnosed as having tennis elbow. Lucky to be alive: Kate White, 32, was left in a coma after contracting the killer condition necrotising fasciitis . The mother-of-one, who had just . returned from Tobago in the Caribbean, was discharged from hospital . after medics put her arm in a sling and told her to take paracetamol. But . within 48 hours Kate was in a coma on life support after contracting . the killer condition, necrotising fasciitis, a bacterial infection that . destroys skin and the fat and the tissue covering the muscles. Doctors . compared the chances of Kate contracting the rare bug as the same as . being hit by lightning in her lifetime - 10,000 to one. The . bug, which kills three quarters of its victims, had ravaged Kate's arm . and doctors were forced to spend four days cutting away at her flesh to . stop it spreading elsewhere. But after the emergency treatment Kate has made an incredible recovery. Kate has now undergone a series of skin graphs with skin has been taken from her left leg to fill in the missing flesh from her arm . Kate, from Birmingham, said: 'The . doctors told me they had never seen anyone as ill as me who had . survived. They said I was the sickest person in the hospital. I'm lucky to be alive.' Kate, . a full time mother to ten-year-old Aliyah, told how she started . hallucinating soon after being discharged from the hospital. She said: 'I'd been taking paracetamol and co-codamol but nothing touched the pain. 'I was delirious and felt really sleepy so my mother called an ambulance. 'When the paramedics arrived, they said my blood pressure was so low I was going to slip into a coma. 'My heart rate was double what it should be and they said I was going to have a cardiac arrest. 'When I got to hospital, they were sticking needles in my neck, my feet, all over. 'They couldn't get a line in because my veins kept collapsing. I was terrified.' Kate . was then moved to a high dependency unit where she was put in an . induced coma on life support while doctors tried to work out her mystery . condition. She said: 'I'd just come back from Tobago so they thought it might be malaria but the symptoms weren't right."" Doctors discovered she had necrotising fasciitis, often referred to as the 'flesh-eating bug' because the bacteria spreads through the soft tissue, releasing toxins that destroy the tissues as it spreads. She was in a coma for a week, while surgeons cut away the infection, before she was well enough to be woken up. Kate was then transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham for extensive skin grafts where skin from her left leg was used to 'fill in' the missing flesh on her arm. Kate, who has needed intense physiotherapy to regain movement in her arm, said: 'I am self conscious about my scars. I don't like wearing short skirts and I won't go out unless I'm wearing a long sleeved top. 'There have been times when I cried but I don't sit there crying every night. I've learnt to adapt. I just get on with it. 'I've got my arm and I'm still here. The doctors said it's like being struck by lightning. The chances of getting a flesh eating bug are that slim. 'It's been a real life lesson. You never know what's around the corner. I've learnt to appreciate things.' Dr Neil Jenkins, consultant in infection and tropical diseases at Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, said: 'Successful treatment relies on immediate recognition of the diagnosis and emergency surgery to remove all infected soft tissue. 'It is true to say that without the 'proper' surgery Kate would have inevitably died. 'At Heartlands Hospital, the infectious diseases clinicians, emergency surgeons and the critical care teams worked together and fortunately Kate survived and her arm was saved. 'We are all delighted that Kate has now successfully recovered.' Necrotising fasciitis is a bacterial infection that destroys the skin and tissue covering muscle. It is pronounced: 'neck-row-tise-ing fas-e-i-tis'. Sufferers contract the condition when the bacteria enters the body through an opening such as a cut, graze, or even a pin prick. The symptoms within 24 hours include pain in the area or limb where the bacteria first entered the body, as well as diarrhea, nausea, fever, confusion, dizziness, weakness, and intense first. Within the next three days, the infected area will swell and blisters fill with blackish fluid may appear. After five days, the condition becomes critical as victims' blood pressure drops severely and the body begins to go into toxic shock. More than 70 per cent of all infected victims die from the infection and a further 20 per cent of survivors need to have a limb amputated to stop the spread of the bacteria to the rest of the body. But necrotising faciitis is still very rare with only 500 to 15000 cases reported each year.","Necrotising fasciitis is often referred to as the 'flesh-eating bug' as it destroys skin tissue as it spreads .

By . Jill Reilly . Last updated at 5:38 PM on 27th January 2012 . A group of Aboriginal protesters hit the headlines again today after they  set fire to the Australian flag outside the country's Parliament in Canberra. A video captured showed protesters outside Parliament setting light to the flag and spitting on it while chanting, 'Always was, . always will be Aboriginal land.'

A . shoe advertised as the one Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard lost . when she was bundled to a car by her bodyguards has been pulled off eBay and handed to a security guard at Parliament House by a member of the Aboriginal tent embassy. The navy-blue suede wedge shoe came off Gillard's foot on Thursday in Canberra as she fled angry Aboriginal rights protesters. The online auction website posted a listing for what was purportedly the missing shoe with a starting price of Aus $148 (£100). 'Please bear in mind also this is a . single shoe, not a pair, so it would be difficult to walk in, unless . you're the PM,' the listing stated, according to the Sydney Morning .

'It really doesn't worry me,' she said . with a grin. 'I'm in a fortunate situation where I'm a woman with a few . pairs of shoes.

"Moses Kamin, 15, charged as an adult with two counts of murder today . Colleagues raised the alarm when the couple didn't show up to work . By . Michael Zennie and Louise Boyle . Last updated at 10:02 PM on 31st January 2012 . An adopted teenager was charged with two counts of murder today after police found the bodies of his parents stashed under a blanket inside the family car. Moses Kamin, 15, appeared in court and was charged as an adult over the deaths of his parents, two highly-educated civil servants, last week. Police went to the house twice on Friday to check on Robert Kamin, 55, and Susan Poff, 50, after their employers reported that they didn't show up for work. After discovering the couple dead, police questioned their son who  later confessed to strangling his parents in Oakland, California. Highly respected: Susan Poff, left, and her husband Robert Kamin were allegedly murdered by their adopted 15-year-old son Moses at their home in Oakland, California . Police have not revealed why Moses allegedly murdered his parents but there have been suggestions the boy was suffering from depression and having problems at a new school. Colleagues of the couple also told the . San Francisco Chronicle that the couple had been having problems with . their son, who they believed was spending too much time in the Occupy . Oakland camp. The San Francisco Chronicle reported he was adopted within the last ten years. Mr . Kamin was a clinical psychologist in the San Francisco County jail . system. Mrs Poff worked as a physician assistant at the Housing and . Urban Health Clinic for the city's health department. She had mentored . hundreds of medical students and nurses. Crime scene: A family friend stands outside the Oakland, California residence where Robert Kamin, 55, and Susan Poff, 50, lived with their son . Remembered: Friends and relatives at the home in Oakland California, where the family had recently moved . Police said the couple's son killed them . on Thursday and then hit their bodies beneath blankets in the family's . PT Cruiser outside. The teen allegedly had tried to set the car on fire. Officers arrived at the house on Friday afternoon when the couple's co-workers reported they hadn't shown up for work. A police source familiar with the case told the Chronicle a co-worker first called the son, who said his parents were out for a walk. The newspaper reports that police arrived to the home near Lake Meritt in Oakland on Friday and spoke with the boy, but found nothing suspicious. Grisly discovery: Police found the bodies of the couple outside the new house they were renovating . When a second call from the co-worker . called the house came in, the boy reportedly said he was in the bathroom . and could not pass the phone, prompting the co-worker to phone police . again. Authorities returned to the home and . noticed charring on the car parked outside, which appeared as if someone had tried to set it alight. Looking inside, they saw a . limb sticking out beneath a blanket. When officer opened the car doors, . they discovered Mr Kamin and Mrs Poff dead. Initially the boy was said to have denied any involvement but later confessed to authorities, according to the Chronicle. The . boy was arrested on suspicion of murder on Saturday. He is being held . at the Alameda County Juvenile Justice Center in San Leandro. Protests: Colleagues of the couple said they had argued with their teenage son about how much time he was spending at the Occupy Oakland camp . Co-workers mourned the well-known couple . after news of their murders became public. Mrs Poff's boss called her . death 'a terrible loss'. Joshua Bamberger told the Oakland Tribune: 'I've never met anyone who lived with as little ambivalence about making the world a better place. 'She was one of the most loving, heartfelt, solid and wise persons who ever cared for people living in poverty.' Poff, who attended UC Berkley, and Kamin, a graduate of Stanford University, met through friends. The couple adopted because they were unable to have their own children, Robert Kamin's brother Bruce told the Chronicle. They had recently moved to the area and were in the middle of renovating their house.","Moses Kamin, 15, charged as an adult with two counts of murder today .

Eight airport security workers have been suspended for alleged blunders including sleeping on duty and not checking luggage for potential bombs. Some of the suspended TSA screeners at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey had even allegedly stolen items from passengers. Hidden CCTV cameras allegedly caught staff at Terminal B - which handles airlines including Delta, British Airways and Virgin - sleeping on the job.

A federal probe caught several TSA screeners sleeping on duty and eight were disciplined as a result, reported the New York Post. In addition one assistant supervisor has reportedly been suspended for improperly overseeing staff she was supposed to be watching. A Transportation Security Administration spokesman only told the New York Post that it takes ‘immediate action’ when standards are not met. Meanwhile screener Kujuanne McNiel is likely to be sacked after allegedly causing two planeloads of luggage to be taken off and rescreened.

Would-be presidential assassin John Hinckley Jnr has engaged in 'risky' relationships with married and psychotic women and may still pose a risk to society, according to a psychiatrist who is an expert in risk assessment for assassins. Hearings to determine whether Hinckley should be allowed more free time outside of St Elizabeth's Hospital to visit his elderly mother in Williamsburg, Virginia, is entering its tenth day today. The 56-year-old tried to kill President Ronald Reagan in March 1981 outside a Washington hotel to try and impress actress Jodie Foster. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity and has been in mental hospital ever since. Risk: John Hinckley Jr, shown here in 1987, wants to extend his supervised day trips away from the mental hospital where he has been confined since he tried to assassinate former President Reagan . Chaos: John Hinckley tried to assassinate former U.S. President Ronald Reagan on March 30, 1981 outside the Washington Hilton hotel . Yesterday, Dr Robert Phillips testified that he is . opposed to Hinckley being given more free time from the hospital he has been treated in the last three decades, citing concerns about the risks his . relationships with women may cause. Dr Robert Phillips said that in the 'real relationships' he has formed with women, he has not always shown good judgement. On the mend: Reagan with his wife Nancy at a hospital in Washington as he recovered from the assassination attempt by Hinckley . As well as getting involved with a 'psychotic' patient from the mental hospital - whom he allegedly became physically affectionate with - he tried to begin a relationship with an employee at Eastern State Hospital, a mental facility Hinckley works a few hours a . week when he's in Williamsburg. The woman was married with children. Dr Phillips said his efforts to attract the married woman were 'either fantasy or abject narcissism'. Hinckley has been diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder. He was also diagnosed as suffering from major depressive and psychotic disorders, but doctors say these are now in remission. Dr Phillips, who is also a medical doctor, is an expert in risk assessment for assassins. The presidential assailant is currently allowed to leave St Elizabeth's Hospital for ten days each month to visit his visiting his mother in a gated community in Williamsburg, Virginia. The hearing is to determine whether the visits can be increased. The latest proposal would allow for two 17-day releases followed by six 24-day releases. Federal prosecutors oppose expanding Hinckley's visits, saying he remains a danger to society. Hinckley shot President Reagan, press . secretary James Brady, Secret Service Agent Timothy McCarthy and police . officer Thomas Delahanty in 1981. All of the men survived the assassination attempt but Brady was left permanently disabled. Better: Hinckley, pictured here in 2003 when he told a federal court that his his mental condition has improved enough that he should be allowed to visit his parents without psychiatric hospital staff supervision . Shooting: Hinckley shot President Reagan, press secretary James Brady, Secret Service Agent Timothy McCarthy and police officer Thomas Delahanty . Reports from the U.S. Secret Service surveillance of Hinckley said he would often visit bookstores when he went to Williamsburg and focused on books about Reagan and assassinations. Though he did not buy the books or even open then, Dr Phillips said this activity indicated a risk factor. He said: 'His target is on this shelf.' Hinckley's defense lawyer argued the shelves at the store he was found to be staring at also contained other books and that he never actually picked any up or bought them but instead bought music books. However the court also heard that he looked at a classical music CD entitled The Dead Kennedys. Dr Phillips, who spent five hours interviewing the would-be assassin last year, will continue testifying today.","Psychiatrist opposes that Hinckley be allowed more free time from mental hospital .

"By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 3:47 PM on 31st January 2012 . The Facebook page of a mother who abandoned her two daughters in Brooklyn was updated with a photograph of a seemingly naked man holding a bottle of champagne hours after the children were dumped. Police were looking for Dalisha Adams around Canarsie, Brooklyn, at around 6.15pm on Sunday when the image of the pink champagne was uploaded. Dominae, five, and three-year-old Diani were found shaken and confused in front of Bay View Houses - around a mile-and-a-half from their home in Breukelen Houses. Scroll down for video . Callous: This image of an apparently naked man holding a bottle of pink champagne was posted on Dalisha Adams' Facebook page hours after she abandoned her two daughters in Brooklyn . Abandoned: Dominae, five, left, and her younger sister Diani, three, said their mom Dalisha, dropped them near a busy intersection in Brooklyn and drove off . Mother: Dalisha Adams was arrested on Sunday night after abandoning her two daughters, aged five and three . Adams, 26, was arrested at around 11pm on Sunday night - more than four hours after the image was posted on her Facebook page. Two women discovered the two little girls and stayed with them until police arrived. They were bundled up warm wearing hooded down coats and Ugg boots at the housing project on Shore Parkway, the New York Daily News reported. A neighbour of the mother, who also has another eight-year-old daughter, said she often heard Adams screaming at her children. She told the New York Daily News: 'She was always yelling at the kids, ""shut the f*** up"". 'One day, I heard her curse out the little baby, ""I'll punch you in the f***ing face"".' The woman also said she heard more shouting on Sunday, shortly before the girls were abandoned. 'A kid was crying. She was saying, ""stop crying, shut the f*** up. I'm gonna get you out of here"",' she said. Dominae was able to remember she . lived in a blue house with flowers in front of it on 53rd street, but . did not know which borough of New York it was. She told a photographer: 'Mommy just left us on the sidewalk and drove away.' She also said her mother's name was Dalisha and she drove a white car. Abandoned: The children were left near this busy intersection in Shore Parkway, Brooklyn . The children showed no signs of physical abuse but were taken to Brookdale University Hospital for observation. Just after 10pm on Sunday night, police arrived at Adams' house and opened the door with a crow bar, but she was not at home. Adams was arrested after police matched the girls' identity with photo records from Administration for Children’s Services, where the children are currently in custody. Adams was charged with two counts of endangering the welfare of a minor, police said. Police were alerted to the the abandoned children by an elderly couple who found them standing at a busy intersection with the diapers in their arms as cars zoomed by them. Rescue: A good samaritan found the children near Bayview Housing Projects on Shore Parkway in Brooklyn, with their extra diapers and called police . Heroes: Police Officers Billy Morales and his partner Ed Centeno made sure they were safe after taking them from the two elderly woman who found them . Grandmother: Bertha Davia said she thinks it has all been a misunderstanding and Dalisha was supposed to leave the girls with her . The girls’ grandmother, Bertha Davia, said it was all a misunderstanding and is asking ACS to place them in her care. The 52-year-old told Eyewitness News that she lives in the complex next to where the children were left and the mother must have intended to leave her children in her care. She said she is furious her daughter never told her the children were coming and only realised what had happened when she saw their picture on the news. 'She left them on the corner here. I live all the way over there. And they was roaming the hallways and all that. Why would she do that to my grandkids? For what reason?' Although she is angry over the incident, she said she does not believe the two girls were abandoned on a street corner and it was just a big misunderstanding. Michelle Davis, 43, from Brooklyn, told the Daily News: 'They were wandering up and down the sidewalk for a while, just playing by themselves. 'It’s horrible. How could you leave your own children out there? They’re babies and you just leave them out there like that?' The police said both children were in good condition after being checked over in hospital and were now in the care of the ACS, who did not immediately respond to an inquiry.

While many Americans might believe their country is becoming more politically divided, it turns out things have hardly changed in four decades. Voters’ views on key issues don’t follow party affiliation as closely as is often thought and polarisation has hardly moved since 1970, a study says. Stronger Democrats and Republicans hugely overestimate polarisation, compared to independents and those more likely to change their mind. Opinions: Voter Anna Carroll makes her choice in this month's South Carolina primary. The U.S. is just as polarised now as in 1970, a study says . ‘We tend to see the world as divided between blue and red (but) the world has much greater shades of purple,’ study author John Chambers said. ‘There is more common ground than we realise,’ the University of Florida psychology professor added at a conference in San Diego, California. People who think the U.S. is more polarised than in reality are more likely to vote, meaning this false idea could drive politics, reported Live Science. It also suggests close elections are decided by voters worried about what others might believe, so whoever builds up those fears the most will win. Unchanged: Polarisation and perceived overestimates have been mostly constant since the days of President Richard Nixon, left, in 1970 to George W. Bush in 2004 . The researchers looked at American National Election Survey data, where respondents gave opinions on issues such as healthcare and defence. 'We tend to see the world as divided between blue and red (but) the world has much greater shades of purple' Study author John Chambers . They considered data from 1970 to 2004 and found what respondents believed a GOP or Democrat voter would think on an issue. The data showed polarisation and perceived overestimates have been roughly constant since the days of President Richard Nixon in 1970. Mr Chambers wants his study to help voters make more informed decisions about candidates rather than simply voting by party. Republican logo: Mike Lachs wears a GOP elephant hat. People who think the U.S. is more polarised than in reality are more likely to vote, a study says . Symbols: The Democratic and Republican parties have long been associated with the donkey, left, and the elephant, right, respectively . But it’s a different story for those inside Congress, with a separate study showing politicians have become more divided by party since the 1940s. 'People are acting on false assumptions. When people feel threatened, they become very defensive' Leaf Van Boven, psychology professor . Another study discussed at the Society for Personality and Social Psychology conference looked at why polarisation is overestimated. Stronger voters project emotional thought processes onto others, University of Colorado psychology professor Leaf Van Boven said. ‘People are acting on false assumptions,’ he added, reported New Scientist. ‘When people feel threatened, they become very defensive.’","Voters' views 'don't follow party affiliation so closely'

Home prices have fallen for a third straight month in nearly all major U.S. cities, with the latest drop steeper than expected and highlighting the hurdles still facing the economic recovery. Prices dropped in November from October in 19 of the 20 cities tracked by a home price index out on Tuesday, with the steepest declines in Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; and Detroit, Michigan. Prices in Atlanta; Las Vegas, Nevada; Seattle, Washington; and Tampa, Florida, fell to their lowest points since the housing crisis began. Phoenix, Arizona, was the only city to show an increase. On the market: A short sale home in the Spring Valley area of Las Vegas, Nevada, is seen. Prices in the city and elsewhere fell to their lowest points since the housing crisis began . ‘We are braced for a more bumpy picture over the next few months,’ analyst Sean Incremona said. ‘A lot of expectations probably ran away or got a little too lofty coming into the end of the year. ‘We are still in a very modest recovery, and we do see consumption slowing this quarter, and data like this supports that picture,’ added Mr Incremona, an economist at 4Cast Ltd in New York. The S&P/Case-Shiller composite index of single-family home prices declined 0.7 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis, which was a bigger drop than the 0.5 per cent economists expected. ‘The trend is down and there are few, if any, signs in the numbers that a turning point is close at hand,’ said David M. Blitzer, chairman of the Standard & Poor's index committee. The decrease added on to the 0.7 per cent fall in October from September. A separate Conference Board report said its consumer attitudes index fell to 61.1 in January from 64.8 the month before. Americans are clearly turning gloomy . about the job market and their income prospects. The data frustrated . expectations for an increase after sharp gains in November and December. Two decades: The S&P/Case-Shiller composite index of single-family home prices declined 0.7 per cent in November on a seasonally adjusted basis, which was a bigger drop than the 0.5 per cent economists expected . The economy grew at its fastest pace in one and a half years in the final months of 2011, but early 2012 could see weaker growth, thanks to a tired housing market and lacklustre consumer spending. Separate data showed business activity in the U.S. Midwest slower than expected in January. Wall Street erased gains following the data, leaving stocks trading flat at mid-morning. 'We are braced for a more bumpy picture over the next few months. A lot of expectations probably ran away or got a little too lofty coming into the end of the year' Sean Incremona, 4Cast Ltd analyst . On a seasonally-adjusted basis, 17 out of 20 cities racked up monthly home price declines, and average national prices were around levels seen in mid-2003, according to S&P/Case-Shiller. Prices in the 20 cities also steepened their year-over-year decline, falling 3.7 per cent compared to a 3.4 per cent decline in October. Previous data lead to optimism that the housing sector is healing. Some economists believe prices will find a bottom this year, but the recovery is expected to be a lengthy one as the market is hampered by an excess amount of homes for sale and weak demand. ‘The most likely scenario in the U.S. is that in 2012 prices will bob around a bit, with one month's gain being reversed the next month,’ Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said. Struggling: Prices dropped in November from October in 19 of the 20 cities tracked by the home price index, with the two of the three steepest declines in Chicago, Illinois; left, and Atlanta, Georgia; right . The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago business barometer slid to 60.2 from 62.2 last month, shy of expectations for 63. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the regional economy. As politicians aim to rein in the deficit, the U.S. is believed to be on track for a fourth straight year with a $1 trillion-plus budget deficit as a sluggish economy holds down corporate tax revenue. 'The most likely scenario in the U.S. is that in 2012 prices will bob around a bit, with one month's gain being reversed the next month' Paul Dales, Capital Economics . However conditions are improving for those in a position to buy a home. Job growth is up, prices are down, mortgage rates are at record lows and rental prices have risen sharply since the housing bust. Still, many are left scratching their heads as they can't afford to buy or even qualify for mortgages. Some people in position to buy are holding off, worried that prices could fall even further. ‘In the fourth quarter there were a few indicators suggesting the economy was shifting into higher gear but in January we've gotten a lot of data to suggest the opposite,’ analyst Christopher Low said. Many economists say the U.S. could be . experiencing what happened in Britain in the 1990s, when it took four . years for home prices to rise again after falling prices left homeowners . with little equity.","S&P/Case-Shiller price index down 0.7%; bigger than 0.5% fall expected .

A teenage curry house owner has spent £5,000 on a second-hand aircraft fuselage which was used in The Da Vinci Code, to display in his reception. But 18-year-old Aleem Gaffer’s plan to spruce up his restaurant backfired when he realised he could not get it inside. Plane crazy: Alim Adbul, 18, had to get his friends to help get the two tonne fuselage into his takeaway in Bristol. It cost him £5,000 . He had to remove the front of the shop and, with a team of six friends, slide the two tonne Hawker jet flight deck into the Indian takeaway in Filton, Bristol. Aleem wants to decorate the fuselage and use it as a seating area for customers to wait in while their food is prepared. The young businessman bought the jet as a gift for his aircraft-loving father and to grab the attention of staff at the nearby Airbus factory. Tight squeeze: Aleem Gaffer, 18, bought the unusual £5,000 shop display to impress his father Abdul, 28, who is a big fan of planes . Glass removed: The window of the restaurant in Bristol is taken out to get the fuselage inside . He said: 'Airbus employs thousands of staff nearby and many of them have to pass my takeaway each day so I thought attract more business. 'I didn’t do the measurements but I was confident it would fit, now we will have to get it in - I hope everything will be sorted over the next month. 'The idea is for people to sit inside the fuselage and admire it while they wait for their food. Tight squeeze: Friends of Alim Abdul use a rope as they attempt to haul the front of the plane - used in The Da Vinci Code - into the curry house . 'People walking past have been a bit shocked but it is something different for the area, hopefully everyone will like it. 'My father loves planes as well so I thought it would be a nice surprise for him. He’s really pleased.' Aleem, who has worked in the Bristol takeaway since he was 12, took over the business from his father, Bangladesh-born Abdul, 38, last year. The plane is a Hawker 800XP. Abdul added: 'It was very surprising when Aleem told me to come downstairs and look outside as I didn’t expect to find a plane. 'I love planes so it is a perfect gift and it is going to look great in the shop. It is amazing.'

The chemicals that cause ground-level ozone can travel between continents . Man-made air pollution from north America causes Europe to lose 1.2 million tonnes of wheat a year, a new study has found. Ozone pollution - produced by coal fired power stations and cars - travels between continents much more easily than thought, traveling thousands of miles on the wind. Crops on every continent are damaged by pollution from others. The wheat loss in Europe is the biggest worldwide. The chemical - a powerful air pollutant - is produced when pollutants near the ground react with sunlight. The researchers say that the pollution could even endanger the security of the food supply in future. Ozone pollution in all of the northern hemisphere's major industrialised regions - Europe, America and southeast Asia - harms major crops such as wheat, maize, soy, cotton, potato and rice on other continents. The scale of the impact has previously been unknown. Ground-level ozone pollution is . produced from chemicals released during . high temperature combustion, for example by combustion of fossil fuels . by motor vehicles and in coal fired power plants. It's separate from the ozone layer, a protective layer around the outside of our atmosphere. Ground-level ozone is harmful to humans as well as plants. The study also suggests that increasing . levels of air pollution from one continent may partly offset efforts on another. The findings have important implications . for international strategies to tackle global food shortages, as well as climate. Dr Steve Arnold, a senior lecturer in atmospheric composition at the University of Leeds, who led the study, said: 'Our findings demonstrate that air pollution plays a significant role in reducing global crop productivity. 'It shows that the negative impacts of air pollution on crops may have to be addressed at an international level rather than through local air quality policies alone.' Wheat harvest: The researchers found that damage to European crops from American ozone pollution is the biggest such 'intercontinental pollution' worldwide . Michael Hollaway, a PhD student at the University of Leeds, used a computer model to predict reductions in global surface ozone if man-made emissions of nitrogen oxide from the three continents were shut off. Using crop location and yield calculations, he and the research team were able to predict impacts on staple food crops, each with their own unique sensitivity to ozone pollution.Dr Lisa Emberson a senior lecturer from the University of York: 'This study highlights the need for air pollution impacts on crops to be taken more seriously as a threat to food security. 'Air quality is often overlooked as a determinant of future crop supply Given the sizeable yield losses of staple crops caused by surface ozone, coupled with the challenges facing our ability to be food secure in the coming decades further coordinated international  efforts should be targeted at reducing emissions of ozone forming gases across the globe.'","Man-made ozone can travel thousands of miles .

"By . Nick Fagge, Katherine Faulkner and Andy Dolan . Last updated at 8:17 AM on 1st February 2012 . Accused: Rimvydas Liorancas, drinking with friends in his home town in Lithuania, was found dead in his prison cell . A Lithuanian charged with battering a retired couple to death in their home was a violent criminal who had already been kicked out of the UK. Rimvydas Liorancas, 37, who was awaiting trial for murdering Carole and Avtar Kolar with a lump hammer, was found hanged in his prison cell on Saturday. He had twice made his way into the UK illegally, on the second occasion without a passport. Today it can be revealed that the convicted armed robber: . The British authorities had no idea Liorancas was even in the country until they arrested him two weeks ago. The jobbing builder targeted Mr and Mrs Kolar, 62 and 58, after he was employed to do some work on the patio at their home in the Handsworth Wood area of Birmingham. The couple, who were married for 40 years, were found on January 11 by their son Jason, 37, a police officer. Liorancas was arrested five days later and charged with murder. He was found dead in his cell at top security Woodhill jail, Milton Keynes, on Saturday before he could offer an explanation for what happened. Murder victims: Avtar Kolar and his wife Carol who were bludgeoned to death with a hammer . Tenants in the seedy Birmingham bedsit where he had been living said Liorancas was ‘a madman’ who kept a collection of hammers in his room. Though he said he was a builder, they suspected him of being a burglar ‘or something worse’. In fact, Liorancas was a career criminal whose string of convictions spanned a ten-year period. Carol and Avtar Kolar's latest grandchild Sonni . The father of two came from the village of Vadzgirys, around 150 miles from the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius. His ex-wife, Ingrida, said the muscular robber had never had a job and had been involved in crime since he left school. ‘He came from a good family, but he did nothing,’ she said. ‘He was a thief, a burglar, a robber. He would steal anything – wood, petrol, property from people’s homes. ‘He drank a lot of alcohol. Almost everyone in the countryside drinks a lot. There’s nothing else to do. ‘We were married for 11 years but he was not home very much. He used to go out drinking all the time with his friends and they would plot their next crime. ‘He would come out of jail, be free for a few months, and then be sent back again.’ She has brought up their son and daughter, now 12 and 17, alone. ‘I’m ashamed of him and so are the children,’ she said. Ingrida divorced Liorancas in 1999, during his first stint in prison for burglary. By 2003, he was back on the prowl and convicted for an armed robbery in the Czech Republic. He returned to his home country in 2005 to serve the rest of his lengthy sentence. Violent crime: Rimvydas Liorancas, pictured in a court sketch, was discovered dead in his cell just 12 days after he had been charged with the brutal murder of Avtar and Carole Kolar, who were bludgeoned to death with a hammer . Four years later, he was granted . parole – and immediately went on the run. When the authorities finally . found him, he had been living in Britain undetected for almost a year. He had somehow made his way into this country despite being on a ‘watch’ list. Liorancas was . extradited back to Lithuania in 2009. Once home, he was sentenced to a . further one year and eight months for absconding and breaking the terms . of his release. By 2011, he . was in trouble again, this time for leaving the scene of an accident . and drunk driving while disqualified. But, incredibly, he was soon back . in the UK. Jail: Liorancas was found hanged in his cell at HMP Woodhill, near Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, just 12 days after he was charged with the murder of Mr and Mrs Kolar . With no right to benefits, he eked out a meagre existence in the run-down Soho Hill area of Birmingham. Housemates said he was violent, heavy drinking, and would steal anything lying around. Shamsher Singh said he threatened to kill him if he came into his room uninvited. Investigation: A forensic tent sits outside the home in Handsworth Wood, Birmingham where bodies of Mr and Mrs Kolar were discovered . Dirty work: Police teams looking for clues search drains near the house in the days after the discovery . ‘He was like a madman,’ Mr Singh, 28, an unemployed chef, said. ‘He pushed me very hard up against the wall and made a fist like he was going to punch me. ‘There was so much anger in his face. He was obviously a bad guy, a violent guy.’ A . month before the Kolars were murdered, Liorancas began doing some . building work on their patio as part of a gang of Eastern Europeans. A . family friend said: ‘It’s terrible to think he decided to attack them . after he had been inside their house and worked for them.’ Three . weeks before the murder, Liorancas left his £40-a-week room without . paying his rent. ‘He seemed very nervous before he left,’ Mr Singh said. ‘He didn’t say goodbye – one day he was just not there.’ Mr Singh said that although the tattooed Lithuanian was ‘not that tall’ he was very strong. ‘He had massive hands and his arm muscles were like iron,’ Mr Singh said. Among the sea of floral tributes outside the Kolars’ semi-detached home yesterday was a photo of their youngest grandchild. Sonni was born to their son, Avtar, and his wife Victoria, both 32, a week before they were killed. The text read: ‘Nanny and Grandad. I love and miss you both. Love always and for ever, your newborn grandson xxxx.’ by JAMES SLACK . If a monster like Rimvydas Liorancas was free to enter Britain, just what does a foreign criminal have to do to be turned away? Inevitably, the issue is complicated by the free movement directives and edicts issued by Brussels which have eroded our border controls. In most instances, Britain must throw its doors wide open to the citizen of a fellow EU country, even convicted criminals. But the rules do allow the UK to turn away the worst offenders. Liorancas, as a convicted armed robber, fell into such a category. The problem in his case is that we had no idea he was travelling to the UK. Lithuania, with other EU member states, has given an undertaking to warn us if a danger man may be heading our way so that he can be stopped from going through passport controls. But the system breaks down entirely when, as in the Liorancas case, the home country of the offender does not keep its side of the bargain. Chillingly, Liorancas is only the latest in a long line of Eastern Europeans to slip through the net. Earlier this month, a senior judge demanded to know why another Lithuanian, child-rapist Victor Akulic, was let into Britain, where he went on to rape a woman. The Mail understands that, in this case, Lithuania again failed to inform the Home Office of his history or possible intention to travel. Last Friday, it emerged that a sexual predator from the Czech Republic who had murdered his wife was able to travel to the UK where he carried out a knifepoint rape and three serious sex attacks. Ministers have made one specific change to the rules which could prevent an exact repeat of the Liorancas case. Now, whenever a person is extradited from Britain that information is passed to ACRO (ACPO Criminal Records Office) which assesses the case. If it shows a public protection risk ACRO asks the UK Border Agency to place a marker on its watchlist. But unless a person has been previously extradited, we remain utterly reliant on other EU member states fulfilling their obligations to warn us of any convict intending to travel.  Ultimately, they know that they have countless free movement directives on their side. Cynically, . they may even take the view that they would rather have their murderers and rapists living in Britain.What is most worrying is that it is impossible to know how many men like Liorancas are already here. And if we did not count them in, how are we to get them out? Heartbreak: Michelle Kirwan and her brother Avtar Kolar break down in tears as they speak about their love for their murdered parents . Tearful: Ms Kirwan told the press conference that after her family learned of the killing 'the light was switched out in our lives and our hearts have been broken forever'","Rimvydas Liorancas, 37, found hanged at Woodhill Prison .

A 25-year-old man held by police after the body of his pregnant prostitute wife was found on a dirt bike track has been placed on suicide watch. Justin Adams, who was arrested for the murder of his wife Jaymie and their unborn child on Friday, told jailors at Oklahoma County prison he had thought about killing himself after she went missing on December 10. The mother-of-three, who advertised sexual services on Craigslist, had gone to meet a client the night she disappeared, her husband told police. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Justin Adams, 25, has been arrested for double-murder after his wife, carrying their unborn child, was murdered. He has been placed on suicide watch . A motorcyclist found her body along a dirt track on January 7, although authorities believe it was just there for a day before it was discovered. The cars of Adams and his mother, Tina Clark, were later seized by police, who said they were looking for evidence in the vehicles. Adams had originally told investigators his wife had gone to meet a friend, but two weeks later revealed she had gone to meet a client in a motel. He admitted he and his wife, who had been married since February, were 'swingers' and that she advertised on Craigslist as a 'massage therapist'. Killed: Jaymie Adams had advertised . as a 'massage therapist' on Craigslist . Adams was arrested on a double murder . complaint on Friday. It came after authorities evidence from interviews, phone records, the internet and email accounts that were inconsistent with Adams's story. Oklahoma law states a suspect can be charged with two murders . if the victim is pregnant. He told his attorney he was stripped of his clothes and was forced to sleep naked on a steel bunk bed without a mattress in prison, NewsOK reported. But a sheriff's spokesman told the paper Adams was given a smock to wear and was on suicide watch for his first 48 hours in jail. Court: Adams, who has not been charged, appears on video at his arraignment . He added Adams now is wearing regular . jail clothes and is on mental health observation status, which means he . is checked every 15 minutes. Police believe he fatally stabbed his wife before dumping her body at a dirt bike track in southeast Oklahoma City, according to NewsOK. He has not yet been charged. Judge Russell Hall told him at a video . arraignment on Monday: 'The district attorney will take a look at the . police report and type up the charges.' The judge denied bail. Adams . was the last person to see his wife alive after she left their trailer . park home in Blanchard, Oklahoma to meet a 'friend' at a McDonald's. Investigation: The body of Jaymie Adams was found on a dirt . bike track weeks after she went missing, and police believe it may have been there for a day . Suspicious: Jaymie Adams, 25, told her husband of 11 months she was going to meet a 'friend' at this McDonalds, where police later found her van . He initially told police she had called from the restaurant saying the friend had not shown up but that was the last he heard from her. He denied knowing who she was meeting. Police seized her truck after Adams called to say he had found it in the McDonald's parking lot. Justin and Jaymie Adams had been married since February and have a four-month-old child together. Following her disappearance, Adams made an emotional TV appeal, urging the public to help bring his wife home safely. Secretive: Adams later revealed his wife had gone to meet a client at a motel . He said: 'She deserves to be at home with her family, our children need their mother. 'My wife is a loving a strong woman. She's an amazing mom, and amazing wife. We have three sons and she's two-months pregnant this week. 'I'm begging that if anyone has any information about my wife or her whereabouts, call police.'

The 'amputee victim' in a controversial ad warning against the dangers of drinking too many sugary drinks - who actually has two normal legs - has revealed his shock at seeing himself in the campaign. Cleo Berry, 27, of Los Angeles, California, is shown in a hard-hitting New York City advert about an overweight man who lost a leg below the knee because too many fizzy drinks led to an amputation. But Mr Berry, who was paid $500 to pose for photos in a studio in Manhattan, New York, several years ago, said he was in tears for a whole minute when he saw himself in the advert last week. Scroll down for video . Big controversy: Cleo Berry, 27, of Los Angeles, California, is shown in a hard-hitting New York City advert about an overweight man who lost a leg below the knee because too many fizzy drinks led to an amputation. ‘I was beyond shocked,’ Mr Berry told . the New York Times. ‘I cried at my computer screen for, like, a minute. I . said: “Oh my gosh, they even gave me crutches. Come on, people”. No amputation: The original picture of Mr Berry from a photo agency shows he has both legs intact . ‘I’ve always wanted my photo in an ad . all over the city, but I was hoping it would be for a TV show or . something, not this,’ he added, saying he would now like to do a . commercial for a fizzy drinks firm. After the advert was released it . emerged that the man featured in the ad - which then turned out to be Mr . Berry - actually has two legs and one of them was edited out by the . advertising agency. The actor told the New York Times he . is happy for the city to educate people on diabetes, but was not . impressed by their use of an edited image of someone who was not a real . victim of the disease. Mr Berry's IMDB film profile reveals . he was in an episode of the TV series House last year, called Out of the . Chute. He has also been in short films and was a stunt man in ‘The . Strongest Man on Earth’. New York City's health department . confirmed that his leg was removed to make the point of the campaign. The photo came from a company that supplies stock images to advertising . firms. But city officials were slammed for . not revealing that he was not a real amputee victim and did not have . diabetes. The photographer who took the picture, Morten Smidt, did not . know Mr Berry. Mr Smidt told the New York Times last . week that he had not seen the advertisement but said of it: 'Well, it is . an illustration now, clearly not the picture I did.' When the adverts were released earlier . this month, fizzy drink manufacturers were quick to attack it, saying . it painted an 'inaccurate picture' of what the beverage does to the . body. Real: The health agency insists that another anti-smoking campaign featuring a woman called Marie from the Bronx was a true-life portrayal of someone who had their finger tips amputated because of smoking . True: They also insisted the man with the voice box is a real-life throat cancer victim . But New York City health chiefs - and . Mayor Michael Bloomberg - insist it is a necessary shock tactic. They . said that in 2006, almost 3,000 New Yorkers with diabetes were . hospitalised for amputations. More than 1,000 of the posters were . put up in subways across the city. But Stefan Friedman, a spokesman for . the American Beverage Association, said the campaign was over the top. 'Instead of utilising scare tactics, . the beverage industry is offering real solutions like smaller portioned . containers and new calorie labels,’ Mr Friedman said. But in a press conference Mr Bloomberg . said: 'What do you want to do? Do you want to have people lose their . legs? Or do you want to show them what happens so that they won't lose . their legs?’ Other city ads feature a smoker who . developed throat cancer at 39 and now has to talk through a voice box . and a woman called Marie who had the ends of her fingers amputated because of . smoking. Also seen: Another ad shows an obese woman dragging herself up a set of stairs as she clings to the handrail over a graphic of how much bigger portions of fries have become . Defence: New York City health chiefs - and Mayor Michael Bloomberg, pictured - insist it is a necessary shock tactic. They said that in 2006, almost 3,000 New Yorkers with diabetes were hospitalised for amputations . ‘This issue isn’t about one actor but . rather the 700,000 New Yorkers who struggle with diabetes, which kills . 1,700 people a year,’ a health department spokesman told the New York .

Killer: Joran Van der Sloot was found guilty of murdering Stephany Flores in 2010 after she found out about his suspected involvement in another disappearance . Yet the 24-year-old killer, who admitted strangling Stephany Flores in May 2010, is still asking Hamer for cash, Radar Online reported. The news site claims van der Sloot hopes to garner more money in order to avoid the 28-year-sentence given to him earlier this month. He has 'been manipulating Hamer to give him more money to pay lawyer fees and pay off prison staff', a source said. But it may be too late for van der Sloot, after Hamer turned her advocacy efforts towards Amir Hekmati, the Iranian-American sentenced to death in Iran earlier this month for allegedly being a spy for the CIA, this weekend. 'I will fight no more': Dr Mary Hamer, 55, paid legal fees for convicted killer Joran van der Sloot - but has written a letter saying she has 'resigned' from his case . Van der Sloot admitted . to strangling Flores after she found out about his suspected . involvement in the disappearance of U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway in . 2005. Throughout the Peruvian case, Hamer had protested his innocence. But . in a letter, addressed to President Obama, Peruvian president Ollanta . Humala, the Flores family and Natalee Holloway's mother Beth, Hamer said . she finally 'accepts defeat'. 'The U.S. government & Peru have won the battle,' she wrote. Victims: Flores, right, was strangled by van der Sloot after she found out about his suspected involvement in the disappearance of U.S. teen Natalee Holloway, left . 'I will fight no more': In the letter, Dr Mary Hamer says she has spent her life savings on legal fees for the case and received death threats . She . also voiced her fears the killer will die of a drug overdose or be . murdered in jail, and that she will 'hold the Peruvian and US . governments responsible if Mr. van der Sloot dies during his 28 year . sentence'. Dear President Obama, President Humala, Beth Holloway, the Flores family, the Media & Joran Van der Sloot: . I, Mary Hamer officially and formally am resigning from my spiritual . and civil rights advocacy work on behalf of Joran van der Sloot. The U.S. government & Peru have won the battle. I lose. I accept defeat. I have fought fervently on behalf of Joran Van der Sloot with NO results. I have sacrificed my life’s savings & I am now poor. I have risked death threats. Joran did Not commit murder. Joran committed Manslaughter with Stephany Flores' provocation. Joran had PTSD Diminished Mental Capacity & He was in a state of Self-Defense from years of a destroyed Self-esteem. I will fight No more forever. Thank you. Respectfully & Humbly, Mary Hamer, M.D. U.S.A. She adds: 'I have sacrificed my life's savings and I am now poor. I have risked death threats.' The . letter re-iterated her belief that van der Sloot did not kill Flores, . rather he committed 'manslaughter with [her] provocation' after . suffering from 'years of destroyed self esteem'. Hamer had old Anderson Cooper in an . interview this month she trusts van der Sloot and believes he is . innocent - and denied he is playing her. She said: 'I still don't know who killed Stephany Flores. There are too many unanswered questions.' The Dutch citizen met Stephany Flores, 21, in a casino in Lima in May 2010. He took cash and credit cards from her before fleeing to Chile, where he was caught two days after her decaying body was found. He . confessed to the 'cruel' murder, telling police he became enraged after . she found out about his suspected involvement in the Holloway case. Ms Holloway, 18, from Mountain Brook, Birmingham, disappeared on Aruba in May 2005 during a high school graduation trip. Van der Sloot was arrested over her disappearance, but never charged. The killer has now appealed his 28-year sentence on the grounds police did not take his initial confession into account.

"Samantha Kwek fell from 100 United Nations Plaza in New York, just one block from UN headquarters . By . Graham Smith . Last updated at 1:37 PM on 31st January 2012 . Tragic: Samantha Kwek, 22, jumped to her death from the 16th-floor of an apartment building near the UN building in New York . A 22-year-old woman who jumped to her death from the 16th floor of a luxury apartment building just one block from the United Nations headquarters in New York was today named as Samantha Kwek. The Columbia University student fell from a balcony following a fight with her boyfriend, who lives in the building, late on Sunday night. She reportedly left a suicide note. She landed on East 48th Street in front of 100 United Nations Plaza, a 52-storey building across the street from the Algerian Embassy. A pocketbook was lying a few feet from her body, which was draped with a white sheet as police investigated. Miss Kwek had threatened to kill herself in several text messages she had exchanged with her boyfriend Benjamin Small, 30, the New York Post reported. A devastated Mr Smart today told the newspaper: 'I really don’t know why [she jumped]. She was really, really sad, I guess... I’m mortified.' Miss Kwek wanted to end their relationship and the couple were thought to have been arguing about breaking up, family members said last night. Her brother-in-law Vincent Campanella, who is married to Miss Kwek's sister, said the couple were due to join them for a meal to celebrate Chinese New Year on Sunday night but didn't come. He said: 'This is really a shock for all of us. It's very hard for all of us to believe. 'She's not one to be attached to a guy like that. She's strong and smart and involved. 'To jump out 16 floors takes a lot, to take your life. It all seems a little too fishy.' Investigation: Miss Kwek's body lies covered by a white sheet after she landed on East 48th Street in front of 100 United Nations Plaza on Sunday night . Plunge: Police say the woman fell from a 16th-storey balcony at 100 United Nations Plaza . Dino Sajudin, 40, a doorman working . on the opposite side of the street, told the New York Daily News that . his friends saw the woman's body on the ground and ran into the building . screaming: 'She just jumped! She just jumped!' He said: 'We crossed the street together and we saw her lying there.' Investigators are examining the 16th-floor balcony of the building, which houses several diplomats. Deb Alter was returning from a . shopping trip with her teenage daughter and ten-year-old son when they . came upon the grisly scene. 'We flipped out,' she said. 'My little boy was really shaken up.' Miss Kwek had long, black hair and was wearing grey Ugg boots, she said. Diplomatic corridor: The building where Miss Kwek fell (lower left corner) is just a block from the United Nations (next to the river, centre) Adjacent to the UN: The apartment building is home to several diplomats who work at the United Nations . Nearby: The United Nations (pictured) is directly south of the building where the woman fell . Another witness said the woman was fully dressed with her coat on. One man, who declined to give his name, was interviewed by police officers about what he saw. 'I just heard a scream,' the man said, declining to elaborate. The gruesome death occurred in New . York's diplomatic corridor, where the UN headquarters and numerous . offices and agencies are located. Several nations also house their . embassies and ambassadors in the upscale neighbourhood where diplomatic . license plates on dark SUVs are a common sight.","Samantha Kwek fell from 100 United Nations Plaza in New York, just one block from UN headquarters ."
"More than 10 millions have broken their New Year's resolution to lose the pounds . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:15 AM on 1st February 2012 . If you've given up on the New Year’s diet and are reaching for that forbidden chocolate bar, it seems you are not alone. February is the month when people are most likely to feel  fat, according to research. It found ten million of us will have broken our healthy living resolutions by the end of today. Tight squeeze: Millions of Brits have failed thus far in their quest to shed excess holiday weight . And it revealed February –  or ‘Flabruary’ as it has been dubbed – is the time when we feel  unhappiest about our weight and lifestyle, mainly because of the failure to shift those extra post-Christmas pounds. The poll, for WeightWatchers, found 41 per cent made a New Year’s resolution to lose weight and 35 per cent to eat better. However, by today 24 per cent – or ten million of us – have broken one or more of our  resolutions. At the same time, 10 per cent are depressed about not keeping pledges. All the trimmings: The over indulgence over Christmas continues to take its toll on Brits' waistlines . Nutritionist Lucy Vickers said: 'People . make resolutions because they want to feel better about themselves but . end up feeling lower than when they started by setting unrealistic . goals. 'This is why Weight Watchers is encouraging people to take this second chance by making February 1st the new January 1st. '(And) to make resolutions they can keep with the right support to help them kick-start a healthier lifestyle and see positive results that last way beyond the start of the year.’",More than 10 millions have broken their New Year's resolution to lose the pounds .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:45 AM on 1st February 2012 . Human traffickers are coaching young adult asylum seekers to act like children so they can claim more benefits when they reach Britain, a court has heard. The claim emerged during a judicial review challenge brought by an Afghan asylum seeker who says he is 16, but is actually thought to be nearly 20. The immigrant, whose identity has not been revealed due to a court order, claimed he was 14 when he arrived in Britain in 2009. The claims emerged after an Afghan asylum seeker who claimed to be 16 took his case to the London High Court . However, social workers found his physical appearance to be like that of an adult who had been 'coached' to act younger than his years. With taxpayer-funded legal help, he has now taken his case to the High Court, insisting his adult appearance is due to his 'ethnicity'. The Afghan said learning difficulties mean he is entitled to a full-time British education until the age of 25. The court heard age assessors from Ealing Borough Council interviewed the asylum seeker after his arrival in the UK and came to the conclusion that he was 'over 18'. Their report stated: 'The social assessors were under the impression that he had been coached and that he was told not to have eye contact with the assessors and not to speak up or demand things from the department.' Despite his shyness in interviews, he insisted on speaking to a lawyer as soon as he was placed with a foster family, and was later spotted chatting on a mobile phone, the court heard. His claim for asylum was rejected in May 2010 after a tribunal found his evidence was 'self-serving and rehearsed'. But his removal from Britain, originally planned for November 2010, has been put off after his lawyers challenged both the age assessment and the Home Office's decision to remove him. Child migrants have access to a larger range of benefits, which are not available to adults, and their young age can greatly improve the chances of them staying in Britain. The Afghan migrant's barrister, Azeem Suterwalla, today told the court that Ealing's age assessment overlooked the impact of his ethnicity on his appearance, and youths in rural areas of the Middle East can develop more quickly than British children. He also claimed his responses in interview were down to his learning difficulties, with his intelligence having since been found to be 'in the bottom one per cent of the population'. The court was shown a report from an educational psychologist, which states: 'If he remains in the UK then his measured level of learning disabilities would entitle him to a full-time education until the age of 25.' An Afghan identity document provided to support his age was described as 'mysterious' by Mrs Justice Lang, and cites his date of birth as 1374 in the Afghan calender, translated as being 1995. After a day of legal argument, Mrs Justice Lang reserved her decision on the case and will now give her ruling at an unspecified later date.","Claims made after Afghan asylum seeker who said he is 16 is suspected of being nearer 20 .

"By . Rob Cooper and Paul Revoir . Last updated at 12:11 AM on 1st February 2012 . TV viewers feel that the elderly get less air-time than other age groups, and older women in particular are ‘invisible’, a BBC report reveals. The research showed viewers felt there was a perceived habit of treating the elderly as ‘peripheral’ or ‘token figures’ in drama, comedy and entertainment shows. They said the elderly were treated as ‘props’ for other stories, and regularly portrayed in a ‘humorous’, ‘mocking’ or ‘insulting’ manner. 'Figure of fun': Viewers complained that Anne Widdecombe, pictured with Anton Du Beke had only been put on Strictly Come Dancing 'for a laugh' Pensioners were often said to be portrayed as stubborn with a ‘tendency to moan about things’ or in some cases as an ‘adorable idiot’. The criticism comes after ex-Countryfile . presenter Miriam O'Reilly, 54, won a substantial payout from the . Corporation after they axed her because of her age. In last year’s landmark ruling the . BBC was accused of being obsessed with attracting younger viewers and of . ‘social engineering’ for sacking her because she was seen as too old. The report also said shows such as Question Time, QI and Mock The Week were accused of using ‘token women’ on their panels. It said: 'Some panel shows were... criticised for rarely having women represented or only having . ‘token women’ on their programmes. 'Comedy shows, such as QI or Mock the . Week, as well as current affairs programmes such as Question Time were . implicated in this.' Both male and female viewers raised . concerns about the vanishing of older women from screens, with more than . a third of women over 55 saying there were too few of their . contemporaries on TV. While the BBC . put 'expert' older men such as Sir Bruce Forsyth and Sir David . Attenborough on screen, they are placed with glamorous young women, the . report authors said. Discrimination: Gina Yashere is the only female panellist in this Mock The Week panel which also features (back row (l to R) Frankie Boyle, Hugh Dennis, Russell Howard, Frank Skinner and front host Dara O'Briain and Andy Parsons. They said they thought it was . generally the case that ‘a person develops “a face for radio” at a . certain point in their middle years’ and were ‘replaced with what people . felt were less qualified but younger, more  attractive women’. Among . the positive role models for older generations were Dame Maggie Smith’s . character in Downton Abbey, the experts on Antiques Roadshow and Joanna . Lumley. Strictly Come . Dancing was praised for the broad range of ages among competitors, but . concerns were raised that older contestants, such as Ann Widdecombe, . were being exploited as ‘figures of fun’. All male panel: Question Time, chaired by David Dimbleby, was singled out for putting only a 'token' woman on their panel. He is pictured with Chris Huhne, left, and Alex Salmond . One woman: Caroline Spelman, the environment minister, is the 'token' female representative on this Question Time panel which features footballer Clarke Carlisle, far left . Age discrimination: Miriam O'Reilly won a substantial payout after showing the BBC sacked her from Countryside because of her age . Viewers said the retired politician had been put on Strictly 'for a laugh' although she could 'hardly dance'. One 72-year-old man questioned for the study said the way older people were treated on the show was 'embarrassing'. 'We didn’t like older people making a fool of themselves on telly, . producers and directors …are taking advantage and are using it for . entertainment,' he said. 'An example of this would be (Strictly) Come Dancing…its . just embarrassing…I don’t like seeing older folk being exploited.' The Serving All Ages survey of 180 viewers aged 13 to 92, carried out for the BBC by independent social research institute NatCen, warned these ‘dated and inaccurate stereotypes’ could result in older people feeling ‘marginalised’. But it found that the elderly were much less ‘sensitive’ about the way they were portrayed than young people, 40 per cent of whom felt they were shown as ‘disrespectful’ and ‘dysfunctional’ with ‘vacuous and unproductive lives’. All male panel: QI, hosted by Stephen Fry, centre, was singled out for criticism in the BBC report . Mark Thompson, BBC Director General . and Chair of the Cultural Diversity Network, said: 'There are lessons . here for the BBC and the rest of Britain’s broadcasters. 'It is young people who are most concerned with the way they are portrayed and we need to look at this. 'But . we should also note the concern, expressed by older people generally, . about the need for greater visibility for older women. While of course . there are many older women presenters and actors across our airwaves, . this is something that needs to be addressed.' ■ Radio 5 Live has been told to tone down its reputation for being ‘Radio Bloke’ and start appealing to more women. A report by the BBC’s governing body found that men make up 72 per cent of the station’s audience of 6.7million listeners each week. The BBC Trust told bosses it wanted to see a ‘more even balance’ of listeners.","Older people treated as the 'adorable idiot' on TV shows, say experts .

"By . Damien Gayle . Last updated at 4:56 PM on 31st January 2012 . A knife-wielding burglar was brought to justice after he was apprehended by a naked soldier whose door he had smashed in during a riad. Aaron Brannan already had 19 previous convictions for 28 offences when, with two others, he smashed into the Salford home of Lance Corporal Wayne O’Mahoney. He was sent to a young offenders’ institution for five years at Manchester Crown Court yesterday after pleading guilty to one count of aggravated burglary. Naked justice: Lance Corporal Wayne O'Mahoney is captured on CCTV tackling Aaron Brannan as the knife-wielding burglar tries to steal his girlfriend's car . But the cocky thug gave a thumbs-up gesture to Judge Andrew Blake as he was led from the dock. Lance Corporal O'Mahoney last night slammed the sentence as a joke. The soldier, who has served in Iraq with the 103 Regiment Royal Artillery, said: 'He smashed into my home at 6am in the morning then threatened me with a knife, causing untold damage. 'He will be laughing in the court’s face with this sentence - and laughing in the face of justice. To me, the sentence is a joke. 'He has made people’s lives a misery and he will only serve half of that sentence. I am really angry. In my eyes, he is laughing at the law.' The court heard how the soldier, 42, . was woken by noises in the early hours and leapt out of bed to come . face-to-face with Brannan at the foot of his stairs. Brannan and his accomplices had smashed their way through his front door. Fully clothed: Lance Corporal O'Mahoney pictured outside his home in Salford, in Greater Manchester . But Lance Corporal O'Mahoney fearlessly grabbed a metal bar from a tool box and, with no clothes on, chased the raiders outside. Brannan, 20, from Higher Broughton, Greater Manchester, then jumped into Lance Corporal O'Mahoney’s girlfriend’s brand new £20,000 Seat Leon after he snatched the keys. Undeterred, Lance Corporal O'Mahoney smashed the driver’s side window with the bar then reached inside to punch Brannan repeatedly about the head and face. Brannan produced a nine-inch knife and threatened to stab him but the soldier continued to punch him until he escaped. He was traced by jewellery that he had stolen during a previous burglary and left in the car. The court was told he also left behind a mobile phone. Judge Blake told Brannan: 'Over the last four years, you were a prolific offender and you repeatedly attacked people’s houses. This was the worst case of all. 'You threatened the victim because he was being aggressive towards you, not very surprisingly given that you had just battering-rammed his front door.' The drama - which was captured on CCTV - unfolded on Gerald Road in Charlestown on August 2 last year. Mocking: Brannan gave the judge a thumbs-up as he was sentenced to five years in a young offenders institution yesterday . Nichola Carroll, prosecuting, said . both Lance Corporal O'Mahoney and his partner were asleep at the time. She said he heard three loud bangs then ran downstairs to see the men. Ms . Carroll added: 'He grabbed a metal bar from a tool box and ran after . them. They ran to the car and the defendant got into the driver’s side. 'The victim, in an attempt to stop the car from being stolen, smashed the driver’s side window with the metal bar. 'He reached into the vehicle and started to punch the defendant in the face. 'The defendant produced a knife from his pocket, brandished it and said ‘I will knife you’. But he continued to punch him and after only a few seconds, the defendant moved over to the passenger side and escaped.' The court heard Lance Corporal O'Mahoney faced a total damage bill of more than £2,500. The car had only been delivered a day earlier. Andy McDonald, defending, said: 'The householder put up a robust defence of his property. My client has genuine contrition.' Lance Corporal O'Mahoney, a former Broughton High pupil, said he would do exactly the same in the same situation and would not hesitate tackling another intruder. He added: 'The sentence will not teach him anything.'

"By . Neil Sears . Last updated at 7:03 PM on 31st January 2012 . Six rowers feared for their lives when they were thrown from their 36ft boat into the middle of the turbulent Atlantic. The crew of five Britons and an Irishman, who were trying to set a new speed record for crossing the ocean, were 520 miles from their destination on Barbados when disaster struck. Two large waves hit the rowing boat, turning it sideways and filling it with water. With seconds, it had capsized - throwing five of the men into the sea, and leaving another trapped upside down with his feet in a harness. Only when the entangled crewmember had been freed by his shipmates, and a roll call had been taken, did the rowers know they had survived the initial incident. Upturned: The crew of the Sara G were taking part in the Atlantic Odyssey challenge to row from Morocco in north Africa to Barbados in the Caribbean . They were 27 days into their arduous . journey, which began at Tarfaya in Morocco - and had been hoping to set a . new record by crossing the Atlantic in 30 days, which they described as . 'the four minute mile of rowing'. After setting of a rescue beacon to . summon help, they had a grim wait of 14 hours in a life raft before they . could be saved by a cargo ship. And while the crew's families were . waiting for them at their planned port of arrival in Port St Charles, . Barbados, the cargo ship was going the other way - so they are to end . their abortive voyage in Gibralatar on the same side of the Atlantic . they set off from, in ten days. Tonight the captain of the doomed . rowing expedition, Matt Craughwell, 33, speaking from the cargo ship . which rescued his team, told how they had escaped a watery end. He had been rowing with fellow Britons . Ian Rowe, a 45-year-old father of four, Simon Brown, 37, a father of . three from Wiltshire, father-of-two Yaacov Mutnikas and 29-year-old Mark . Beaumont, a documentary maker from Perthshire, Scotland, as well as . Aodhan Kelly, 26, from Dublin, Ireland. Mr Craughwell, of Hertford in . Hertfordshire, said that after ten days of difficult weather, with . unpredictable swells coming from every direction at their boat, the Sara . G, the end finally came on Monday morning. It happened as first one wave, then another, lashed their fragile craft. Mr Craughwell said: 'As the wave moved through it rotated the boat through 110 degrees. Capsized: The five British and one Irish rower were 27 days into their journey when the 36ft vessel overturned at 11am yesterday, 520 miles from their destination . 'She instantaneously started taking on water and the boat was capsized within about 10 seconds. 'One of the rowers was in the upturned . boat for about 15 seconds because we couldn't remove his feet from the . harnesses. It was quite a relief when she capsized and we called the . names - and everybody responded.' He said it then took the crew 15 . minutes of bobbing around in the water to inflate their life raft and . secure it to the capsized rowing boat. But the crew of experienced . adventurers responded expertly. Reacting in any other way could have . been fatal. 'Frightened is a word I wouldn't use, it was flight or fight from everybody,' said Mr Craughwell. 'It happened so quickly.' The frantic pace soon slowed when the . crew spent up to four hours resting in their life raft as they got their . strength back from their near-death experience. Attempt to right their . boat then failed, so they set off a second rescue beacon, after one used . earlier failed to draw a response. But they had a long nerve-wracking wait to be saved. Route: The crew of the Sara G were just 520 miles from their destination when they capsized . 'The time went incredibly slowly, it was a traumatic experience,' said Mr Craughwell. In total it was 14 hours, and in the . early hours of this morning, before they were picked up by a Panamanian . flagged merchant vessel, the Nord Taipei, which was en route from . Venezuela to Egypt. The mother of rescued rower Simon . Brown, Janet Brown, said she had a sleepless night after hearing the . team's organisers on dry land had lost contact following the capsize. Mr Brown said: 'At about 3am this morning I just heard that they had been picked up by a cargo ship - which was a great relief. 'I hadn't slept - I hadn't slept since he left, actually.' Mrs Brown went on: 'I think they will . be totally gutted that it's happened, that it's ended like this, because . they were you know really on for the record. 'They were really up for it, they were going well and I didn't expect it to end like this but I'm glad that they're safe.' Coastguards in Falmouth, Cornwall, had . helped coordinate the international rescue of the rowers after the . emergency beacon was detected. They then managed to contact the rowers . by satellite phone, and traced the nearest cargo vessel. It is not the first near-calamity to hit cross-Atlantic rowers. Three years ago ill-fated skipper Mr . Craughwell had already been rescued on an earlier cross-Atlantic rowing . bid after his boat lost its rudder when it crashed into a whale. And in December two transatlantic . rowers, Briton Tom Fancett and Tom Sauer, who is half Dutch half . Russian, had to be rescued from a life raft in the middle of the ocean . because their small boat sank in rough seas.","Five British and one Irish rower found drifting on life raft of Sara G .

Celebrity Big Brother winner Denise Welch's alleged toyboy lover appeared in court today charged with stealing £12,000 cash from a building firm. Lincoln Townley, 39, is accused of stealing the money from FM Conway, a construction company based in Dartford, Kent, in 2009. Townley, who is 14 years younger than 53-year-old Welch, is said to have had a secret eight-month fling with the Loose Women presenter behind her husband Tim Healy’s back. Dressed in tight skinny jeans, a black shirt and black jacket, party planner Townley spoke only to confirm his name at today’s short hearing at Southwark Crown Court. Townley was due to stand trial, but the case had to be adjourned until May for him to be granted legal aid. When asked outside court about his relationship with Welch, who was recently crowned Celebrity Big Brother winner, he refused to comment and a pal with him shouted: 'F*** off.' Welch, 53, is alleged to have met Townley last April at the Jet Black nightclub in central London and gone back to his apartment. The pair have since been spotted at trendy bars and clubs in the West End and Townley reportedly met up with her in hotels after she had finished filming Loose Women in London. It is claimed the pair even spent the night together in a five-star hotel before Welch went into the Celebrity Big Brother house, where she famously got topless in the hot tub with X Factor reject Frankie Cocozza, and that she had told pals he was her 'London guy.' It is not the first time Welch has cheated on her husband. In 2004 she had an affair with carpenter Steve Murray and Mr Healy wanted a divorce before finally forgiving her. However, the actress, who has been married to the Auf Widersehen Pet star for 24 years and has two children with him, appeared to shrug off the latest affair rumours as she celebrated her husband’s 60th birthday on Monday. The pair laughed and joked and Welch, who is known for her wild antics, even flashed her bra at waiting photographers. They got some front: Denise Welch and friends bare their chests for photographers as they celebrate her husband Tim Healy's 60th birthday . She is said to have told a friend she and Mr Healy were not splitting up saying: 'Tim and I are incredibly secure and have a very happy marriage. Family, our sons, are out biggest priority. 'I just want all this to go away so we can get on with our lives.' Earlier this week another man, 26-year-old theatre producer Tom Hopkins, who is gay, claims he had a four-month affair with Welch after meeting her at a wake. A spokesman for Welch and Mr Healy said they believed the allegations to be false. When asked about the affairs on Loose Women, Welch replied: 'Everything is fine at home.'","Lincoln Townley appeared at Southwark Crown Court .

A bitter ex-girlfriend used make-up to accuse her former boyfriend of rape  after he dumped her. Kira Lee Gould, 22, from Australia, applied a layer of powder to her face before going to the police where she claimed her partner, Warren Clark had repeatedly hit her. Those allegations led to Clark, a former Royal Navy Able Seaman, losing his job. Cover up: Warren Clark was arrested after his ex-girlfriend used make-up to allege that he had beaten and raped her . After breaking up with his girlfriend in February last year, Clark asked Gould to move out of his apartment. However, he was stunned when police arrested him the very next day at his Naval base in Darwin after Kira had complained to officers. That led to police obtaining a warrant to search his home, and in a bizarre turn of events, they found him in possession of cannabis and a stun gun. Whilst the rape charges against Clark were dropped, he did plead guilty to holding 0.2mg of the Class B drug along with the weapon and was subsequently fined £190. Speaking outside of court Clark said: 'It's a pretty weird and twisted web that I got myself into.' His lawyer told how the weapon and drugs were only discovered by police following the false complaint. Robert Welfare told the magistrate: '(His ex-girlfriend) put make-up on her eye and went to police and told them she had been raped and bashed.' He added that police found her claims to be a 'complete fabrication'.

Miss Bliss left a heartbreaking suicide note of apology to her husband and family before taking her life . She was found dead in the swimming pool at the couple's beach side mansion in Perth at the weekend. Her . younger brother, 55-year-old Peter Bliss, who revealed details of the . suicide note today, said that after battling months of depression she . wrote that she 'just couldn't keep going on as she had'. Mr Bliss said his sister had tried to take her life twice in the past and had undergone electric shock treatment late last year. 'Sometimes it seemed to be working and other times it didn't,' he said. 'It was as if she was sabotaging herself - as if she didn't want to get better. It was distressing to see. She was in an extremely fragile state.' He . also revealed that Miss Bliss had left notes in the past with a similar . tone to the one found at the couple's £3 million home in the Perth . suburb of Cottesloe. The note was in his sister's handwriting, he said, and was 'loving and apologetic.' He . told PerthNow that while he had not seen the note personally 'I know . she said how wonderful Al (Mr Bond) was and what a beautiful, . unbelievable husband he had been to her.' 'She just said she couldn't keep going on as she had, especially with all that stress and pain on the family,' he added. Luxury: Miss Bliss, 57, is believed to have been found by Mr Bond floating in the pool of their home (pictured) Aerial view: The swimming pool in the back garden of the couple's mansion is circled in red . Mr Bond and his wife divided their time between London - where the businessman was born before his parents emigrated with him - and Perth. Mr Bliss said he had flown to London twice during the past 18 months in a desperate attempt to help his sister and see if he, along with Mr Bond, could bring her 'back from a place no-one wanted her to be.' The hardest decision he had to make, he said, was to commit his sister to care on one of the occasions he was in London. It reached the stage where he and Mr Bond had to have her committed to care for a month. Mourning: A grief-filled Mr Bond has spoken only briefly about Miss Bliss's death, saying he had lost his 'beautiful wife' 'It was a very difficult time for all of us, but at least we knew she was getting the best care.' On her release from care, he said, his sister had 'good and bad days'but in general she remained 'very depressed and anxious up to the point when she was 'acutely depressed.' Last year, said Mr Bliss, his sister had started voluntary electric shock treatment and while it was supposed to have a 70 per cent success rate, he wasn't sure about that. A grief-filled Mr Bond has spoken only briefly about Miss Bliss's death, saying he had lost his 'beautiful wife'. His daughter Jody Fewster made a brief statement to the media saying her father was too distraught to say anything more on the tragic death of his wife. 'The family is devastated, her (Di’s) friends are devastated and dad just can’t talk at the moment' she said. 'I just really appreciate your interest because she was beautiful but that’s all about we can say at the moment' she added. Mr Bond is believed to battled desperately to revive his wife, a former air stewardess, and called an ambulance at around 11.30 am. Tragic: Mr Bond is believed to battled desperately to revive his wife, a former air stewardess, and called an ambulance at around 11.30 am . Ms Bliss, who had worked as a Qantas flight attendant, in public relations and later as a successful theatre producer, married Bond in 1995 after he had been discharged as a bankrupt. He was divorced from his first wife, Eileen, three years earlier. Bond, 73, who emigrated with his parents from London to Australia in 1950, began as a signwriter but went on to become a multi-millionaire whose investments in airships, property, breweries and diamond mines enabled him to bankroll challenges for the America’s Cup, the premier international yacht race. In 1983, his Australia II Syndicate won the trophy, which had been  held by the New York Yacht Club since 1851. In 1987, Bond controversially bought Vincent van Gogh’s Irises for £36 million – at the time the highest price paid for a single painting. But the purchase was subsidised by a substantial loan from auctioneer Sotheby’s, which Bond failed to repay. Art experts suggested it may have been a manipulated sale designed to artificially inflate the value. After his empire collapsed, Bond was declared bankrupt in 1992 with personal debts of £1.2 billion. He was jailed for seven years in 1997 after pleading guilty to using his controlling interest in the Bell Resources company to siphon off more than £800 million into the coffers of his Bond Corporation. He served four years in jail and since then he has worked with his son, Craig, to build up a new fortune in oil and diamonds. By 2008, Bond was said to be worth about £170 million.","Miss Bliss, told of her sorrow for the stress and pain her struggle with mental illness had caused her family .

"By . Daniel Martin . Last updated at 9:19 AM on 30th January 2012 . Discipline: Boris Johnson has backed Labour MP David Lammy's call for a rethink on smacking laws . Boris Johnson has backed calls for parents to be allowed to smack their children to instil discipline. The Mayor of London spoke after a senior Labour MP blamed his party’s partial ban on smacking children for last August’s riots. Former education minister David Lammy called for a return to Victorian laws on discipline, saying working-class parents needed to be able to use corporal punishment to deter unruly children from joining gangs and wielding knives. He claimed parents were ‘no longer sovereign in their own homes’ and feared that  social workers would take their children away if they chastised them. Labour’s 2004 law did not completely ban smacking,  but said a smack should cause no more than a reddening of the skin. Last night Mr Johnson supported Mr Lammy, saying the current law was ‘confusing’, meaning that parents do not know how far they can go in terms of smacking their children. ‘People do feel anxious about imposing discipline on their children, whether  the law will support them,’ he told the Pienaar’s Politics programme on BBC Radio 5 Live. ‘I think there ought to be some confirmation that the benefit of the doubt will always be given to parents in these matters and they should be seen as the natural figures of authority in this respect. 'Obviously you don’t want to have a licence for physical abuse or for violence and that’s very important.’ The Mayor said he believed he had the support of Education Secretary Michael Gove. ‘I know that people will have their own views, but let  me just say on the issue that’s been raised a lot of times with me; the issue of are you allowed to chastise, are you allowed to impose discipline?’ Aftermath: David Lammy inspects riot damage in Tottenham last summer. He wants the ban on smacking children overturned to help prevent a repeat of the mass disturbances . Lack of discipline: Mr Lammy said many of his constituents had told him the outbreaks of nihilistic violence that characterised the riots had been down to their inability to properly chastise their children . Mr Lammy, MP for Tottenham, where . last year’s riots started, said: ‘Many of my constituents blamed the . Labour government afterwards, saying: “You guys stopped us being able to . smack our children”. ‘These . parents are scared to smack their children and paranoid that social . workers will get involved and take their children away.’ Mr . Lammy said middle-class families can handle rebellious children by . putting them in tennis classes or private schools – options not open to . poorer parents. Parents in . Tottenham had to ‘raise children on the 15th floor of a tower block with . knives, gangs and the dangers of violent crime just outside the . window’, he said. ‘We should return to the law as  it existed for 150 years  before it was changed in 2004,’ he said. ‘The law at that time left judges to determine if a parent had used reasonable chastisement. ‘Under the new arrangements, it is left to social workers. ‘We . should allow 99 per cent of parents to determine how to help their . children understand boundaries and learn right from wrong.’ Mr . Lammy said he had smacked his sons, aged three and five, ‘but it . doesn’t happen very often – usually when they are in danger’.","London Mayor backs David Lammy's calls for rethink on smacking .

A Florida man charged with hacking a homeless Connecticut man to death with an axe and eating his eye and part of his brain was ordered today to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. Tyree Lincoln Smith, 35, stared blankly as he stood with his hands chained behind his back during his arraignment in Bridgeport Superior Court on a murder charge for the December killing of Andre Gonzalez. Police in Bridgeport said Smith was . covered in blood when he told his cousin about the murder, after . developing a lust for blood he needed to satiate after eating a rare . steak. Superior Court Judge Earl Richards set Smith's bond at $1million at the urging of prosecutors, who described the crime as 'extremely heinous'. In court: Tyree Lincoln Smith, 35, was arraigned today on charges of hacking to death a homeless man, Angel Gonzalez, and eating his eye and part of his brain . It was his first court appearance . since he was returned to Connecticut on Tuesday following his arrest . last week in Lynn Haven, Florida, six miles northeast of Panama City. The Connecticut Post reports that Judge Richards ordered the evaluation at the urging of Smith's lawyer, Public Defender Joseph Bruckmann, and ordered him to remain in custody in lieu of $1million bond. The judge also ordered Smith placed on a suicide watch at the Bridgeport Correctional Center at Bruckmann's urging. The next hearing was scheduled for February 14. Shackled: Smith, pictured with defence attorney Joseph Bruckmann, left, faces the judge in Bridgeport, Connecticut Superior Court . Victim: Talitha Frazier holds a photograph of her brother-in-law, Angel 'Tun Tun' Gonzalez, right, as she speaks in front of the courthouse . Smith, a Floridian who grew up in . Ansonia, Connecticut, is charged in the December 15 killing of Angel . Gonzalez, whose decomposed body was found on the third floor of an . abandoned home in Bridgeport on January 23. Police said the body significantly wounded and blood was spattered on a nearby wall. According to the Post, police noticed one of the victim's eyeballs and a piece of his brain was missing when they found the body, but initially attributed that to rats. Prosecutor Donal Collimore urged the judge to set a high bond, describing the crime as 'extremely heinous'. Mugshot: Smith was arrested in Lynn Haven, Florida last week . Talitcha Frazier, a sister-in-law of the victim, said she remembered seeing Smith asking for change on the street. 'I think at the time I told him to get a job. I had no idea then that he had killed my brother-in-law,' Ms Frasier said on the courthouse steps after the hearing. Smith came to the attention of authorities when his cousin in Connecticut, Nicole Rabb, contacted Bridgeport police about Gonzalez's slaying. Ms Rabb told detectives that Smith had arrived at her house December 15 and said he had developed a lust for blood after eating a rare steak and wanted to 'get blood on his hands'. According to an arrest warrant . affidavit, he left the woman's East End apartment with a small axe . before going to the abandoned home, where he used to live. The . next day, Smith returned to the cousin's house with blood on his pants, . hands and the axe, the affidavit said. Police say he told his cousin he . had 'gotten his blood'. Ms . Rabb said Smith told her that he was sleeping on a porch at the . abandoned home when he was awakened by another man and invited inside. Then Smith described beating the man's face and head with the axe and . collecting one of his eyes and some of his brain matter, which he . consumed over a male cousin's grave at the Lakeview cemetery, the . affidavit said. 'Tyree told [Rabb] the blows to . [Angel Gonzalez's] head were so severe that he was able to remove an eye . from the man's head along with pieces of brain matter and a piece of . his skull,' the warrant reads, according to the Hartford Courant. 'At the cemetery he said he ate the eyeball, which tasted like an oyster, and the brain matter,' it continues. As the Post reports, Ms Rabb told detectives she called Smith's mother, who suggested to police on December 16 that they check the abandoned home and that her son had 'mental issues', the affidavit said. Smith had left Connecticut for Florida on Friday on a Greyhound bus, the cousin told detectives. Lynn Haven police say federal, state . and local law enforcement officers took him into custody last week at a woman's . apartment without incident. She told authorities she was unaware of his alleged actions.","Tyree Lincoln Smith, 35, arraigned on murder charge for December 15 killing of Angel Gonzalez ."

"By . Lucy Laing . Last updated at 5:41 PM on 30th January 2012 . When his son Daniel was given just months to live without a lifesaving transplant, devoted father David made a brave decision. His son was suffering from a rare liver condition and it was unlikely that surgeons would find a donor liver in time. So he decided to step forward and risk his life to donate part of his own liver to save his desperately ill son. Surgeons removed a fifth of Mr O’Shaugnessy’s liver and transplanted it into his son - who has now made a complete recovery. Mrs O’Shaugnessy, 42, a pre-school teacher, said: ‘I’m just so grateful to David for saving our son. A family affair: When his son Daniel (right) was given just months to live without a lifesaving transplant, devoted father David made a brave decision and decided to donate part of his own liver . ‘It was a risky operation for him, but he never hesitated to risk his own life to save Daniel. It was terrible seeing them both go through the operations at the same time, and I had to go between one hospital ward and the other to help them both. But luckily they have both recovered. To see Daniel doing so well now is amazing.’ Little Daniel, now three, was diagnosed with the life-threatening condition biliary atresia when he was just 12 weeks old. Biliary atresia is a serious but rare disease of the liver that affects newborn children. It occurs in approximately one in 10,000 babies and it means that the loss of the bile ducts cause bile to remain in the liver and damage it. It can lead to liver failure which can only be cured with a transplant. Mrs O’Shaugnessy first noticed there was a problem with her son when he was just four days old, in February 2008. She said: ‘He was jaundiced, but I thought that it would clear up . within a few days as a lot of babies are jaundiced after birth. ‘Two weeks later he was still jaundiced, . so I started to get worried. At his eight week check up his stomach was . so swollen too that his belly button had been pushed outwards, but the . GP just told me to put him in the window to get some more sunlight. A rare disease in which the tubes which drain liquid bile from the liver are progressively destroyed. This fibrosis of the biliary duct system results in a build up of bile, which damages the liver. As a result, the condition invariably leads to death from liver failure by the age of two if untreated. Effective surgery can relieve symptoms in most cases and a liver transplant is also an option. As a result, survival rates are now above 90 per cent. It's not clear how or why the disease occurs, and many factors may be involved. Bile is made by the liver and helps with the digestion of fats. If bile is not removed from the liver, it builds up and begins to damage it. The baby can develop develop jaundice, or a yellow colour of the skin as levels of the bile chemical bilirubin rise in the blood. Tests are often required to confirm a diagnosis of biliary atresia, as the symptoms can be confused with other conditions. The earlier the condition is detected, the less damage it will have done to the liver and the better the chance of a successful outcome to treatment. ‘When I showed the doctor his stomach he said that it was normal for his belly button to be stuck out.’ Daniel’s health continued to deteriorate and when he was 12 weeks old his condition was diagnosed as biliary atresia. Mrs O’Shaugnessy said: ‘We were so shocked when the doctors told us what he had, and completely devastated.’ Daniel underwent an operation immediately to try and redirect the bile through his liver but it wasn’t a success. Mrs O’Shaugnessy said: ‘His liver had already been too badly damaged for the operation to work. If he had been diagnosed earlier when his symptoms first became apparent then he would probably only have needed the first operation. ‘But by the time it was carried out the surgeons told us that it was too badly damaged. His only chance of survival was a liver transplant.’ Daniel was put onto the transplant list for seven months, but as the months went by, no donor liver could be found. Daniel’s condition started to worsen and the doctors approached Mr O’Shaugnessy to see if he would consider donating part of his own liver to save his son. Mrs O’Shaugnessy said: ‘After two months of being on the transplant list, there was no donor to be found and Daniel started to get worse, which was terrifying. We knew that a liver transplant was the only way of saving him. ‘When the doctors asked David if he would be a donor, he didn’t hesitate. Luckily he proved to be a good match for Daniel, which meant that the transplant could go ahead. ‘I was worried about both my son and my husband being in the operating theatre at the same time, and it was a risky decision for David to make, but it was Daniel’s only chance of survival and he didn’t hesitate to save him.’ The transplant took place in December 2008 and Mr O’Shaugnessy, who works in pharmaceuticals, was taken down first to the operating theatre, Mrs O’Shaugnessy said: ‘I walked down with David first, then I had to carry Daniel down a short while later. It was a nervewracking wait whilst the operations took place and I just had to pray that everything would be alright.’ A fifth of his father’s liver was taken out and transplanted into Daniel and operation was a success. Mrs O’Shaugnessy said: ‘I had to run between the hospital wards after the operation and I would feel guilty leaving one to go and see the other. But just a couple of days after the operation, David was well enough to walk down the corridor and come and see Daniel. It was a very emotional moment, knowing that he had saved his son’s life.’ Mr O’Shaugnessy took two months to recover before he went back to work, but Daniel suffered constant infections and potential rejection for the next two years and was in hospital. He has only just made a complete recovery and the family, who are supported by the Children’s Liver Disease Foundation, are thrilled with his progress. Mrs O’Shaugnessy said: ‘We had a constant worry that the liver was going to be rejected and he was constantly having to go back into hospital for treatment, but now it finally seems to have settled down and he is doing well. He has to go for check ups every two months now, and he has just started nursery school in September. I am so grateful to David - he has given our son a second chance at life.’ For more information visit www.childsliverdisease.org .","Daniel O’Shaugnessy was given just months to live .

Mr Santorum cancelled campaign events yesterday morning after his disabled daughter Bella was admitted to hospital for pneumonia. He will return to the campaign trail later today. Pause: Rick Santorum's eldest daughter Elizabeth took over campaign engagements yesterday after the GOP presidential hopeful cancelled campaign events when his three-year-old disabled daughter was hospitalised. He will return to the campaign trail later today . Up front and centre: Elizabeth Santorum is flanked by supporters as she makes the address . 'Rick and his wife Karen are admitting their daughter Bella to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia this evening,' campaign spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement late on Saturday night. Mr Santorum spoke with Florida supporters by telephone yesterday from Bella's hospital room and said doctors hope she can go home in the next few days. The former Pennsylvania senator said: 'We're going to get out on the campaign trail later tomorrow... heading out to the Midwest, and start campaigning in the next states as we move this campaign forward.' Mr Santorum has a speech scheduled for later today in Missouri and another event in south-west Minnesota - two states with early February contests. He then plans to head to Colorado and Nevada for events tomorrow. 'I feel very, very good about where we are and where the campaign is going,' the candidate said. Hospitalised: Mr Santorum cancelled campaign events after his daughter Bella was admitted to hospital for pneumonia . Disability: The three-year-old was born with Trisomy 18, a genetic disorder fatal to half of those born with it within their first week . By Sunday evening an aid told ABC News that the three-year-old has pneumonia in both of her lungs. Mr Santorum had been scheduled to . appear . on NBC's Meet The Press and attend church in Miami. Officials did not . cancel Sunday afternoon's events in Sarasota and Punta Gorda, where . Elizabeth Santorum made an appearance in her . father's place. She told reporters on Sunday: 'You know we do what we do as a family, you know we stick together and you know, we get through and we're hanging in there.' Trisomy 18, also called Edwards syndrome, is a genetic disorder where a person is born with extra chromosome 18 material from a third copy which interferes with normal development. Described as a relatively common condition, it occurs in about one out of 3,000 live births, killing half of those within their first week. Those who have survived into their teenage years suffer from serious medical and developmental problems including clenched hands, mental deficiency, a small head or jaw and heart defects. A small number of adults with the condition make it to their twenties or thirties while always requiring assisted caregiving. Source: Trisomy18.org . Isabella Santorum has Trisomy 18, a genetic condition caused by the presence of all or part of an extra 18th chromosome. Mr Santorum said of his daughter: 'She without a doubt has turned the corner.' But he cautioned she 'isn't out of the woods yet'. When asked about her, Mr Santorum . says his daughter was not expected to survive until her first birthday . and often has to catch himself to stop from tears. 'I . have a little girl who's three-and-a-half years old,' he told Christian . conservatives in Iowa before winning the caucus contest there. 'I don't . know whether her life is going to be measured - it's always been . measured - in days and weeks. Yet here I am... because I feel like I . wouldn't be a good dad if I wasn't out here fighting for a country that . would see the dignity in her and every other child.' When voters ask him about her, he . calls the decision to campaign 'gut-retching' but says he hopes to fight . for all special needs families. 'You think she's fine, and then one cold and she's this close to dying,' he told the Washington Post in an interview last year. In . October, he missed one of Bella's surgeries to participate in a debate . and told the audience that he planned to take an all-night flight home . from Las Vegas to be with her. 'I look at the simplicity and love . she emits,' Mr Santorum said in a web video his campaign released after . his scheduling drew questions, 'and it's clear to me we're the disabled . ones.'

But Bella did join Mr Santorum for a few days . around Iowa's straw poll in August, and she joined her family in . Charleston, South Carolina on the day of its primary. Florida's presidential primary is on Tuesday. 'You know we do what we do as a family, you know we stick together and you know, we get through and we're hanging in there.' - Elizabeth Santorum . Santorum said that the situation as a . 'very, very tough night last night' but said by late Sunday Bella was . 'alert and back to her own beautiful, happy girl.' Santorum said: 'It's been a very hectic 36 hours. Life in the Santorum family has dramatically improved . since the late afternoon.' Mr Santorum's rivals for the top White House seat, however, have taken a break from politics to send their well-wishes to his young daughter and the Santorum family. Republican presidential primary . frontrunner Mitt Romney told Fox News: '[My wife] Ann and I send prayers and best . wishes for Bella's good health to Rick and Karen Santorum and their . entire family.' Asked whether he had a conversation with the Senator about dropping out of the race, Newt Gingrich told reporters today: 'As you, I think, may know, his . daughter went into the hospital last night so this would be a totally . inappropriate time to do anything like that. 'Rick's going to get a . decent vote tomorrow - on Tuesday - I have no doubt the two of us are . going to collectively outscore Romney. And at that point it might be a . pretty good conversation.' Campaign trail: Mr Santorum's political commitments sometimes clash with his family life . President Obama's adviser David Axelrod at the start of an interview on 'Meet the Press,' also offered his thoughts to the Santorum's. 'Let me also add my prayers and thoughts . for Senator Santorum and his child. I have gone through problems with a . child and my heart goes out to him and his family,' he said.

A sneering murder suspect lapped up attention on his way to arraignment on Wednesday for allegedly shooting a New York City police officer, kissing the air and smiling for family as he wrestled with cops who hauled him inside in handcuffs. Police say 29-year-old officer Kevin Brennan was shot in the base of the skull by 21-year-old fugitive Luis 'Baby' Ortiz at a Brooklyn housing project. Wrists shacked as he was led from the 90th precinct to Brooklyn Criminal Court he proudly told onlookers 'Yeah, take a picture of me'. As the New York Post reports, Ortiz told his family 'I love you guys' as he was led away in front of family members. The newspaper reports his sister slammed the trunk of a car he was led into and screamed 'F*** the police' before she was subdued by officers. Kevin Brennan, 29, was hailed by colleagues after being hit in the base of the skull when he and two other officers responded to reports of shots being fired at Bushwick houses in Brooklyn. The plain-clothes cops had arrived at the scene to see three men running out of a building and immediately set off in pursuit.

Ken Clarke told MPs the taxpayer-funded Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme was now in 'serious financial difficulty' Victims of violent street attacks left with a dislocated jaw or broken hand will be denied compensation under new cuts. Burns victims with permanent scarring will also be refused payment as part of reforms announced yesterday by Justice Secretary Ken Clarke. Payouts for minor injuries will be scrapped, while those for some more serious injuries will be sharply reduced to focus funding on ‘support services’ and the victims of the worst crimes, he said. Around 15,000 a year will lose out  under the changes. Critics said it was wrong that ‘innocent victims of crime’ should suffer. Mr Clarke told MPs the taxpayer-funded Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme was now in ‘serious financial difficulty’ with a deficit of more than £250million. The changes to the scheme will see an end to all payouts for ‘lower level’ injuries. Mr Clarke said they would affect those with ‘sprained ankles, broken toes or bruised ribs’. Currently there are 25 compensation bands starting at £1,000 for minor sprains and fractures, or ‘temporary mental anxiety’. At the top end victims can receive up to £250,000 if they suffer paralysis and very serious brain damage requiring fulltime care. Under the proposals, awards for the lowest five bands will be scrapped. Anyone with a minor head injury, such as concussion or headaches lasting up to four months, would be excluded, as would attack victims who have suffered a dislocated jaw or broken hand. Burns victims who have suffered ‘minor disfigurement’ and would otherwise have been given £1,500 will also receive nothing. More serious injuries, such as a broken foot, moderate burns or a fractured collar bone will see payouts cut. Victims of violent street attacks left with a dislocated jaw or broken hand will be denied compensation under new cuts . A victim who suffered a broken jaw  which needed an operation and suffers ‘continuing significant disability’ would currently be entitled to £8,200, but this would fall  to £6,200. Someone who suffered a fractured skull needing an operation would receive £6,600 now, but will see that cut to £4,600. Payouts for moderate facial disfigurement will be cut from £5,500 to £3,500. The amount crime victims would receive for loss of earnings could also be capped at £12,600. However higher level awards for victims of more serious crimes will be protected, Mr Clarke said, as will payments to the families of murder victims. He told the House of Commons the scheme in its current form was ‘not sustainable’.‘Instead of compensation going to those with less grave injuries and those who have been breaking the law, it will be targeted where it counts – on the most serious injuries,’ he said. Burns victims with permanent scarring will also be refused payment as part of reforms announced yesterday by Justice Secretary Ken Clarke . ‘The support services which many victims need as much as – or more than – compensation will be available when required, paid  for as far as possible by offenders, not  the taxpayer. ‘For families bereaved by homicide, and those affected by serious violent and sexual crimes, these reforms will move compensation on to a sustainable footing, and at the same time improve the quality and availability of practical support and advice.’ But Labour justice spokesman Sadiq  Khan said the plans appeared to be a ‘smokescreen, masking much wider and deeper cuts to compensation for those innocent victims  of crime.’ And Jean Taylor, from Families Fighting for Justice said: ‘If you have been attacked, no matter why you have been attacked you should be compensated in some way. ‘We knew there were going to be cuts  but these are quite serious injuries and victims should be helped. Ken Clarke should think again.’ Mr Clarke will also scrap compensation for anyone with a criminal record. Over the past decade around 20,000 criminals have been paid more than £75million, including a convicted rapist who was given £62,000 and a double killer handed more than £27,000. Based on figures for the last two years, more than 17,000 claims totalling in excess of £25million for injuries including sprained ankles, broken toes and dislocated jaws would no longer qualify for compensation under the proposals. A further 12,950 claims totalling £50million would be reduced. Current £60 fines which are dished out to motorists caught driving, using their mobile phones and speeding, could rise to between £80 and £100 . These would include payouts for brain injuries, such as minor brain damage, well-controlled epilepsy and permanent disabling dislocations and fractures, the Ministry of Justice consultation document said. The victims’ surcharge – a levy on fines issued by the courts which funds support for victims of crime – currently raises about £10million each year. However, the Government also spends about £66million on these victim and witness support services. In a separate move, victims could be given a greater say in the sentences handed down to offenders, with new rules for judges. Current guidance means judges should take victims’ statements into account when passing sentence, but many victims do not realise this. In future all victims will be encouraged to make statements expressing the impact a crime has had on them.","15,000 a year will lose out under Justice Secretary Ken Clarke's changes .

The challenge began when daytime TV host Ellen DeGeneres asked the U.S First Lady on her show: 'How many push-ups can you do? Because I like to do a push-up.' 'I don't know I can do some - can you?

The ladies then took off their jackets and began the challenge to which Mrs Obama won after completing an impressive 25 . To which the TV host stood up and took off her jacket, and a smiling Mrs Obama, who has completed push-ups with Archbishop Desmond Tutu stood up ready to take on the challenge. The pair started doing the push-ups on the studio floor with the audience counting along - Mrs Obama completed an impressive 25.

The First Lady has spent the last few days in California, promoting her health agenda and making high-profile TV appearances. On Tuesday night she  told Jay Leno 'I can't sing' on Tuesday night, but claimed that her husband was in the habit of serenading her.

She praised efforts to improve public health, saying: 'We're not just making this generation healthy. We're making the next, and the next and the next.'

"By . Michael Seamark . Last updated at 12:10 AM on 2nd February 2012 . A £2million truce was called yesterday in the bitter feud ripping through Gordon Ramsay's family and business empire. The celebrity chef had accused his father-in-law Chris Hutcheson of hacking into private emails and plundering £1.4million from his restaurant empire to finance his serial womanising. Hutcheson, who denied the claims, branded Ramsay a fame-obsessed 'monster' and sued him for unfair dismissal and unpaid wages. Ramsay's kitchen nightmare: The TV chef (right) had declared war on his father-in-law Chris Hutcheson (left)... but the pair have reached a settlement . Ramsay's wife Tana sided with her . husband and severed ties with her parents after discovering her . philandering father had kept a second family secret from her for 30 . years. But the very public spat is now at an . end after Ramsay and Hutcheson, his former business partner, friend and . close confidant, reached a £2million settlement, although the Kitchen . Nightmares star has also run up a huge legal bill. Ramsay's publicist, Freud . Communications, said: 'Gordon Ramsay and Gordon Ramsay Holdings have . reached a settlement with Chris Hutcheson and other members of the . Hutcheson family. 'The terms of the settlement are . confidential but we can confirm that Chris Hutcheson is no longer a . director or shareholder of Gordon Ramsay Holdings and all civil . litigation and employment tribunal claims brought by each of the two . parties and other family members have been withdrawn.' Hutcheson is believed to have received . about £2million, which includes payment for a 30 per cent share in . Gordon Ramsay Holdings. A source close to Ramsay, 44, said: . 'Gordon has spent a fortune to get to this point – not just on lawyers . but accountants and computer experts. He wanted to sever every tie with . his father-in-law, but of course it's meant Tana has had to pay a very . heavy price. Public spat: Ramsay's wife Tana sided with her husband and severed ties with her own parents after discovering her philandering father had kept a second, secret family from her for 30 years . 'She doesn't expect to have any . further contact with her father – nor even her mother because she's . stood by him – but she feels as betrayed by him as Gordon does. 'Tana always puts their own family . first and that's why she believes Gordon's done the right thing. She . won't talk about it but there were things which her father did that . disgust her.' The TV cook alleged Hutcheson hacked into Ramsay's personal and company files . The slanging match between Ramsay and . Hutcheson began 16 months ago when the TV cook sacked his father-in-law . as chief executive of Gordon Ramsay Holdings. Hutcheson, 63, branded Ramsay a . celebrity-obsessed 'monster' and accused him of turning Tana against . him. Ramsay, in an explosive public letter, revealed that he had . employed private detectives to investigate Hutcheson and savaged the . 'dictator' father-in-law and 'his very complex life'. It was not until May last year that . the astonishing story behind Ramsay's decision to sack his business . partner emerged when the High Court lifted a gagging order Hutcheson had . taken out to hush up his double life. Tana Ramsay was among the last in her . family to learn that for more than three decades Hutcheson had had a . second, secret family after fathering two children by his mistress . Frances Collins. She is one of a string of women with . whom Hutcheson allegedly betrayed his wife Greta, by whom he has four . children, including Tana. Last summer Ramsay lodged a writ at the High . Court suing Tana's father, mother, sister, brother and brother's wife. The chef alleged that Hutcheson hacked . into his personal and company files, wrongly withdrew £1.42million from . the company to fund his double life and paid a separate mistress £5,000 . a month. Ramsay also claimed that Hutcheson put his wife and son on the payroll and wrote five-figure cheques to himself. In December Ramsay was awarded . £250,000 costs after a judge ruled that Hutcheson, Tana's sister Orlanda . Butland and her brother Adam were liable for breach of confidence after . hacking into personal emails and company computers.","Fiery celebrity chef declared war on father-in-law .

Immigrants are to be banned from taking the driving test in their native  language amid mounting evidence that rogue translators are helping them cheat their way to a licence. Government sources last night said that it would ditch the rules ‘within months’ that let learners sit the theory test in any of 19 foreign languages – including Urdu, Russian and Albanian – and ban translators who can currently sit in on the practical test to explain the examiner’s instructions. Nearly 800 people have had licences revoked in the past two years, after investigations by the Driving Standards Agency uncovered evidence of rogue translators coaching learners during their test. Change: Tests must now be carried out in English or Welsh after investigations uncovered rogue translators . There are dozens more cases in the pipeline and nine translators have been struck off the approved list. A Department for Transport source said each investigation costs an average of £10,000 – and warned that the cases uncovered so far may be just the ‘tip of the iceberg’. Ministers are also concerned about the safety implications of handing driving licences to thousands of people who do not speak English and cannot read road signs. In 2010, some 93,407 driving theory tests were sat in a foreign language. More than 1,500 people also took the theory test for a bus driver’s licence in a foreign language. Transport minister Mike Penning said the existing rules also acted as a disincentive for immigrants to learn English . Transport minister Mike Penning said the existing rules, which were introduced by  the last Labour Government, also acted as a disincentive for immigrants to learn English. He said: ‘This practice is wrong on many levels, and we are going to end it. It  is very hard to fathom the logic of why  it was ever allowed in the first place. Road safety should be our priority, not  political correctness. ‘It cannot be right to be handing British driving licences to people who are unable to read warning signs flashed up on motorway gantries. There is also evidence of fraud. ‘But there is also a wider point about community cohesion – we should be encouraging people to learn English, instead of offering them ways to avoid it.’ Government sources said the change, which could be brought in by the autumn, did not require a change in the law. In future, drivers will be able to take their test in only English or Welsh. However, the Equality and Human Rights Commission has privately warned ministers that the ban may breach anti-discrimination laws unless the Government can produce firm evidence that allowing people to take the driving test in a foreign language is a threat to road safety. But Mr Penning said he was confident that there was ‘just cause’ for the ban, and pointed out that most other EU countries do not allow learners to take their driving test in a foreign language.",Nearly 800 people have licences revoked in the past two years after DSA finds evidence of cheating .

Out of luck: Lottery winner Robert Moffat leaves Falkirk Sheriff Court after pleading guilty to crashing his father's car while five times the drink-drive limit . A former barman who enjoyed the trappings of wealth after scooping £800,000 on the lottery hung his head in shame today as he admitted being a drink-driver now living on benefits. Robert Moffat became one of Scotland's first big-money winners when he took a share of his family's £3.5million pay-out. Happily married with a daughter, he surrounded himself with life's luxuries - a plush Range Rover stood in the driveway of his home while a lovingly restored classic Triumph sports car gleamed in he garage. Both had personal registration plates. However, Falkirk Sheriff Court heard how he had now lost it all, including his wife, Michelle, and was currently unemployed. Moffat, of Denny, Stirlingshire, admitted driving with an alcohol count of 186 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The limit is 35mcg. His pleas of not guilty to two further charges - failing to give information to the police as to who was the driver and failing to co-operate with a preliminary breath test - were accepted by the Crown. Mark Keane, prosecuting, said that a member of the public phoned the police at 5pm on December 30 after seeing a car crashed into a pavement bollard at Northfield Rd, Denny. The depute fiscal said the driver was Moffat - at the wheel of his father’s X-type Jaguar. Mr Keane said: 'As he approached the locus, he lost control, striking a bollard on the pavement. As a result, the front of the car was damaged. 'The member of the public saw the car with the engine still running. The sole occupant of the car got out and walked off up the road.' Fall from grace: Moffat poses with his wife, Michelle, by his house and luxury Range Rover. He has since lost all three and is now living off benefits . He added said: 'The witness was of the opinion that the driver was under the influence of alcohol and he reported the matter to police.' Moffat was traced and taken to a police station where he admitted it was his father’s car and said 'sorry'. He gave a sample of breath for analysis and the reading, which amounts to over 5.3 times the limit, was obtained. Defence solicitor Dick Sandeman said: 'Mr Moffat has had a particularly hard time over the past year or so. He lost everything he had in his business and his wife and he split up. He has a drink difficulty.' He added that lottery winner was now unemployed, on Jobseekers allowance, and he offered to pay any financial penalty at £10 a week. Sheriff Vinit Khurana deferred sentence for three weeks for background reports in view of the high reading. He disqualified Moffat from driving in the interim. Moffat’s life was made a misery when a former girlfriend claimed he was the father of her son, Robert, from a short-lived affair. After he landed lucky with the lottery cash, he found himself in the same court defending a bitter paternity action filed by Caroline Thomson of Maddiston, Falkirk. Former Falkirk Sheriff Andrew Murphy threw the case out when DNA tests proved Moffat could not be the boy’s dad.","Robert Moffat lost his flash cars, house and even his wife .

The neighbours of a dead teenage girl who mysteriously vanished while babysitting for them have finally been charged over her death. Couple Eric and Dea Millerberg were long suspected in the death of 16-year-old Alexis Rasmussen who was discovered in a shallow grave in October six weeks after disappearing. Alexis of North Ogden, Utah died from a drug overdose, on September 10 before her body was dumped in a remote area of Morgan County. Charged: Eric Millerberg, left, and his wife Dea, right, have been charged over the death of their babysitter Alexis Rasmussen . Tragic: Alexis Rasmussen, 16, of North Ogden, Utah died from a drug overdose, on September 10 before her body was dumped in a remote area of Morgan County . Prosecutors say the teenager was having a 'relationship' with 36-year-old Mr Millerberg that involved him supplying her with drugs reports KSL 5 News. Mr Millerberg is charged with first-degree child abuse homicide as well as obstructing justice, unlawful sexual activity with a minor and abuse or desecration of a dead body, reports KSL. His wife faces a charge of abuse or desecration of a body. Of the homicide charge against Mr Millerberg, Weber County Attorney Dee Smith said: 'The evidence does not suggest that this was an intentional act to cause her death,' according to the Salt Lake Tribune. But explained that a child abuse homicide charge can be filed even if the intent of the defendant wasn't to cause death but acted 'recklessly in the course of committing child abuse', the charge is warranted. 'Our view is, providing and . administering certain controlled substances to a minor in the way they . were administered in this case results in an act of child abuse,'  he said, reported KSL. Search warrants have alleged the couple were supplying Alexis drugs in exchange for baby-sitting. However, Smith refused to release details of what type of drugs killed the teen. Prosecutors say the teenager was having a 'relationship' with 36-year-old Eric Millerberg, pictured at an earlier court hearing, that involved him supplying her with drugs (file photo) Smith described Mrs Millerberg’s involvement in Alexis’ death as 'minimal'. She was 'relieved' that charges were filed, her attorney Michael Bouwhuis said in a statement, reports KSL. 'She has always maintained that she did not cause the death of Alexis Rasmussen, and this charge bears that out,' he said. 'She is very sorry about the untimely death of Alexis Rasmussen and sincerely hopes that the Rasmussen family will someday soon find healing and comfort.' Alexis was last seen on September 10, 2011, when her family said she went to the home of the Millerberg's to baby-sit. Her body was found on October 18 near a river in Morgan County. Vanished: Alexis was last seen on September 10, 2011, when her family said she went to the home of the Millerberg's to baby-sit, her body was found six weeks later . Sometime during the late hours of September 10 and early morning on September 11 inside the home, Alexis died of an overdose from drugs provided by Mr Millerberg, Smith said, reports KSL. 'In the months leading up to the disappearance of Alexis, she was heavily involved in narcotic use, specifically methamphetamine and prescription medication,'  a police report filed in November states. North Ogden Police Chief Polo Afuvai told KSL that the charges had been a long time coming. 'We're hopeful that we can now move forward and see the case through the court system. We hope to give the family closure.' Mr Millerberg is currently in prison for a drug-related probation violation. Mrs Millerberg is due to appear in court . on May 24 on unrelated charges of falsely obtaining or dispensing a . prescription and endangerment of a child or a vulnerable adult.","Alexis Rasmussen, 16, disappeared in September, her body was found six weeks later in a shallow grave .

He said: ‘I had been on a family vacation and was looking for driftwood on the beaches with my daughter. ‘As we were returning to our hotel we spotted from a distance what looked like large pieces of driftwood. ‘But when we got a better look we realised the 'driftwood' was moving and it was actually a large group of elephant seals.’ Piedres Blancas is separated in to two beaches and can home as many as 15,000 elephant seals. During Mr Jensen's visit, there were as many as 3,000 lying on the two beaches. Mr Jensen, from California, said: ‘At this time of year the seals are growing new skin and shedding their old skin. ‘The juveniles and females come first, followed by the young males and then the adult males. ‘The elephant seal molt is considered a ‘catastrophic molt’ because, unlike most mammals, it occurs in a short period of time.’ He . added: ‘I had not seen anything like this before, but now that I know . about this place, I will visit it each time I travel up there. ‘It is truly an amazing sight to see so many animals clustered together but it can be quite noisy when they are not resting.'",Thousands come ashore in California to shed annual layer of skin .

Breakfast found himself lost in translation today after using the word 'w****r' while discussing a Stateside remake of Only Fools And Horses. Presenters Bill . Turnbull and Sian Williams had asked funnyman Dave Fulton how he would pronounce one of Del Boy's favourite sayings 'lovely jubbly' in an American accent. Fulton replied: 'You wouldn't, because it's like me saying w****r'. Scroll down for video . U.S. comedian Dave Fulton (left) looks bewildered after using the word 'w****r' on BBC Breakfast, not realising it's offensive. Fellow guest Mitch Benn (right) looks on with bemusement . Moments earlier, presenters Bill Turnbull and Sian Williams (right) had asked Fulton how he would pronounce one of Del Boy's favourite sayings 'lovely jubbly' in an American accent . Fulton replied: 'You wouldn't, because it's like me saying w****r' While the W-word is offensive in the UK, its derogatory connotation is generally unknown in the States. American dictionary Merriam-Webster defines 'w****r' as 'chiefly British, usually vulgar'. To U.S. ears, the word just means 'a stupid person'. Such is . the mild nature of the swear-word in the U.S. that it even appeared in a . 1998 episode of The Simpsons ('Trash Of The Titans'), where it is . uttered by  U2 bass player Adam Clayton and Mr Burns. In 2008, the episode aired twice before the watershed on Channel 4 uncensored and received 31 complaints. Amid shrieks of astonishment, the presenters immediately apologised to viewers. Mr Fulton, clearly taken aback, also said sorry - unaware of the offence he had caused. Fellow guest, comedian Mitch Benn, could not help . laughing and struggled to compose himself. Mr Fulton, who is described on Comedy . Central as 'looking like the underfed brother of Billy Connolly', is well known . for his wry observations of British life. He has lived and worked in the UK for many years and has often performed at the Edinburgh Festival. But he had overlooked one of the most . infamous swear words in the country. A BBC spokesman said: 'Unfortunately, a guest used a swearword live on-air this morning. 'Both Sian and Bill apologised immediately and again at the end of the interview. We are sorry for any offence caused.' Meanwhile, Twitter users have been congratulating Mr Fulton by . saying he 'just made my morning'. Ryandoc117 tweeted: 'Dave Fulton saying . 'w****r' on bbc breakfast did a better job of waking me up than my coffee . haha.' Lfparker2 said: 'Funny to see comedian . Dave Fulton slip up on bbc breakfast and use the word.' And MrPaddyDoherty said: 'If you just . heard American comedian Dave Fulton saying 'W****R' on BBC breakfast news just . made my morning ................!!!!!!' Look out, America, the Trotters are coming . Del Boy rarely made it past Peckham in his yellow Reliant Robin. But the Trotters could finally be taking their brand of market trading global, with a deal that is set to conquer America. Senior . U.S. TV executives have commissioned a pilot episode of the much-loved . British sitcom, which starred David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhust. Del Boy, left, Rodney, centre, and Granddad, right, could feature in a U.S. version of Only Fools And Horses being planned by TV executives . The show could see U.S. versions of Del . Boy, Rodney and Uncle Albert using expressions such as 'tool' instead of . plonker and 'awesome' instead of lovely jubbly. And the loveable rogues are more likely to live in an apartment than a block of high-rise council flats. Writers . Steven Cragg and Brian Bradley, the team behind hit shows Happy . Endings and Scrubs are understood to be working on a pilot. Characters: Steve Carell, left, from the U.S. version of The Office could play Del Boy while Jason Biggs could portray Rodney . The show will centre on the the . 'misadventures of two streetwise brothers and their ageing grandfather as . they concoct outrageous, morally questionable get-rich-quick schemes in . a bid to become millionaires', according to the Independent. The sitcom was an enormous success in . Britain, where it was broadcast on BBC1 between 1981 and 1991. Highly-anticipated Christmas specials were also shown until 2003, when . Del Boy finally made his millions by selling an antique watch. Plonker - tool . Lovely jubbly - awesome . Dipstick - schmuck . Wally - dope . Geezer - dude . Bird - babe . Perfect - ace . Terrific - neat . Easy money - pure gravy . Pound - buck . Boozer - joint . Cushty - all good . Pukka - primo . One . iconic scene showed Del Boy and Rodney dress up as Batman and Robin, . before turning up at a wake they thought was a fancy dress party. But the unique brand of British humour may not prove as popular with a U.S. audience familiar with a different style of comedy. Previous attempts to repackage popular shows such as Dad's Army and Are You Being Served for a U.S. audience failed. Even . The Office written by Ricky Gervais initially received a lukewarm . reaction from baffled audiences before it became a success. One . of the few other shows to have become a success in the U.S.  was . Steptoe And Son, which was remade as Stamford And Son and ran between . 1972 and 1977. Steve Carell, who played Ricky .

There . have also been suggestions that Jason Biggs, who played Jim in American . Pie, could star as Rodney. While Robin Williams might play Uncle . Albert.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:44 PM on 2nd February 2012 . Republican presidential front-runner Mitt Romney was today targeted by gay-rights activists who 'glitter bombed' him on the campaign trail - twice. The unusual form of protest is usually deployed against politicians who oppose gay marriage. After one attack Mr Romney said: 'I've got glitter in my hair. That's not all I got in my hair. I glue it down every morning.' He was earlier left red-faced hours after his victory in the Florida primary when he said he's 'not concerned about the very poor' because they have an 'ample safety net.' Scroll down for video . Glitterbomb: Mitt Romney was targeted by gay-rights activists on the campaign trail in Minnesota . Protest: But the candidate laughed off the attack and said: 'That's not all I got in my hair. I glue it down every morning' As the day began, the former . Massachusetts governor told CNN from Florida: 'I'm not concerned about . the very poor. We have a safety net there. If it needs repair, I'll fix . it. I'm not concerned about the very rich. They're doing just fine. I'm . concerned about the very heart of America, the 90-95 percent of . Americans who right now are struggling.' 'You can focus on the very poor, that's not my focus,' he said. Democrats and Republicans alike pounced and the GOP front-runner's comments as Mr Romney quickly sought to explain his remarks. President Barack Obama's re-election campaign was quick to criticize. 'So much for 'we're all in this together,' tweeted Obama campaign manager Jim Messina. 'No, no, no, no, no, no, no,' Romney . told reporters on his campaign plane when asked about the comments. 'No, . no, no. You've got to take the whole sentence, all right, it's mostly . the same.' He said his remark was consistent with his theme throughout . the race, adding: 'My energy is going to be devoted to helping . middle-income people.' Left holding the baby: Mitt Romney poses during a campaign stop in Eagan, Minnesota on Wednesday. The GOP frontrunner came under fire after saying he is 'not concerned about the very poor' Rich and poor: Mr Romney's comments will have extra resonance with his opponents as he has a personal fortune of $250m which may claim make him unsuited to understanding the needs of ordinary Americans . Despite attempting to explain himself, Mr Romney's comments quickly became an immediate distraction from his message that he's more conservative than chief rival Newt Gingrich and from the double-digit thumping the former House speaker sustained in Florida. His campaign worked behind the scenes to provide context for the comment. Some conservative pundits also labeled it a gaffe and said it was evidence Mr Romney wasn't prepared to run against Obama. 'The issue here is not that Romney is right or wrong, but that he is handing choice sound bites to the Democrats to make him as unlikeable as he made Newt Gingrich,' said Erick Erickson on the conservative RedState blog. And Jonah Goldberg at the conservative National Review Online said of Romney: 'Every time he seems to get into his groove and pull away he says things that make people think he doesn't know how to play the game.' With criticism mounting, Romney flew . to Minnesota and addressed a rally before heading to Nevada. He also . boasted in flight about his 'huge' Florida victory. Victory: Mitt Romney addresses supporters in Tampa after his resounding win in the Florida primary . Mr Romney, whose central challenge is winning over sceptical conservatives, told reporters on the plane that the fact that he performed strongly among conservatives in Florida made sense because he's more conservative than Gingrich. 'I'm not saying he's not conservative. I'm just saying he's not the pure conservative he would have people believe, and I think folks in Florida saw through that,"" Romney said. His campaign also started airing a radio ad in Colorado on Wednesday that says ""conservatives across America are supporting Mitt Romney.' But Mr Romney was immediately was forced to clarify his comments about the poor. Asked whether his words might strike some as odd, Mr Romney said: 'We will hear from the Democrat party the plight of the poor and there's no question, it's not good being poor, and we have a safety net to help those that are very poor.' Mr Romney added that he's more worried about the unemployed, people living on Social Security and those struggling to send their kids to college. 'We have a very ample safety net and we can talk about whether it needs to be strengthened or whether there are holes in it. But we have food stamps, we have Medicaid, we have housing vouchers, we have programs to help the poor,' Mr Romney said. ""But the middle-income Americans, they're the folks that are really struggling right now.' Optimistic: Newt Gingrich was focusing on the future after his setback in Florida . Mr Romney has broached the subject of the poor repeatedly on the campaign trail but until Wednesday had been more careful in his choice of words. 'I worry about the very poor and I want to make sure that our safety net is there,' Mr Romney said in New Hampshire in December, says the middle class are ""the people I'm really concerned about right now.' Wednesday wasn't the first time that Mr Romney, who made millions working in private equity, has been accused of insensitivity on matters of wealth. He once said 'I like being able to fire people' when talking about having the ability to choose service providers. He also has declared that he knew what it was like to worry about being 'pink-slipped' out of a job. The gaffe will come as a bitter blow to Mr Mitt Romney who romped home to an overwhelming victory in the Florida primary, re-establishing himself as the clear frontrunner in the Republican battle to face President Barack Obama in November. The former Massachusetts governor . took a 14-point lead on 46 per cent, with Newt Gingrich on 32 per cent, . Rick Santorum trailing on 13 per cent and Ron Paul in fourth with seven . per cent. In his victory . speech in Tampa, Mr Romney congratulated his opponents on ‘another . hard-fought contest’ and said that ‘the three gentlemen left are serious . and able competitors’. Third place: Rick Santorum, who gave up on Florida days ago, has been campaigning in Colorado . But his main target was Mr Obama. He . launched a blistering attack on the President and promised to 'end the . Obama era and begin a new era of American prosperity' after years of . economic decline. 'Mr President, you were elected to lead, you chose to follow, and now it's time to get out of the way.’ He added: ‘Three years ago this week, . a newly elected President Obama faced the American people and said that . if he couldn’t turn the economy around in three years, he’d be looking . at a one-term proposition,’ he said. ‘We’re here to collect.’ The drubbing of Mr Gingrich, the shock . victor in South Carolina 10 days ago, will put pressure on him to . abandon his White House bid but the former House Speaker shows no sign . of giving up yet. Mitt Romney - 46% (771,842 votes) Newt Gingrich - 32% (531, 294) Rick Santorum - 13% (222,248) Ron Paul - 7% (116,776) Mr Gingrich was surrounded by volunteers holding . ‘46 States to Go’ signs as he delivered a defiant address in Orlando. He . did not mention Mr Romney by name and barely acknowledged he had lost . as he vowed: ‘We are going to contest every place and we are going to . win and we are going to be in Tampa as the nominee in August.’ In a . rallying cry for conservatives to unite behind him, he said: ‘It is now . clear that this will be a two-person race between the conservative . leader Newt Gingrich and the Massachusetts moderate, and the voters of . Florida really made that clear,’ He pledged to ‘have people power beat . money power in the next six months’. Mr Gingrich’s second place . showing, clearly ahead of Mr Santorum, the Iowa victor, and maverick . libertarian congressman Mr Paul, will bolster his case that he is the . only conservative alternative to Mr Romney. Mr Gingrich has already . called for Mr Santorum to pull out and endorse him. Mr Romney’s . Florida victory gives him all 50 of the state’s convention delegates. His advisers were exultant at registering a landslide margin greater . than the 13 per cent achieved by Mr Gingrich in South Carolina. Given . that Mr Gingrich led in the polls after South Carolina, the Romney . campaign hopes that the win in Florida, where Mr Romney lost to John . McCain in the 2008 primary, will cement their message that he is now . almost invincible. After the four successive contests in Iowa, New . Hampshire, South Carolina and Florida, the Republican race now becomes a . much more national affair – a significant advantage for the richer and . better-organised Mr Romney, the long-time party establishment choice.

It'll never stir the passions like a Ferrari and you won't see its picture adorning the bedroom wall of the average adolescent teenage boy. But the venerable Toyota Corolla has overtaken Fords F-series truck to become the best selling vehicle of all time. The ultra-reliable, if perhaps rather dull, Japanese runaround has clocked up global sales of around 37.5 million since it was first rolled out in 1966. Record breaker: The humble Toyota Corolla has become the world's best selling car of all time . Original: A first generation Toyota Corolla from 1966. Over the past 40 years one has been sold every 40 seconds . With its winning recipe of value-for-money, . thrifty gas mileage and a huge dealer network, a Corolla has been sold . on average once every 40 seconds for the past 40 years. Now into its tenth generation Corollas . are  manufactured in Japan, Brazil, Canada, China, India, . Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, South Africa, Taiwan, . Thailand, Turkey and Venezuela. However production in the US, based in  Fremont, California, ended in March 2010. Sales of the car really took off during the 1970s oil crisis as its frugal four cylinder engine offered great mileage, a feature that continues to add to its popularity today. It's success brings to an end an impressive 24 year run by Ford's F-series pick-up truck which,  with sales of over 35 million, now pulls over into second place. In third place is the Volkswagen Golf having notched up sales of 27.5 million. VW's Beetle comes in at fourth with 23.5 million sold and Ford's Escort which has sold 20 million, is in fifth. Despite only being in eighth place over all in terms of total sales many experts still rate the Ford Model T as the most successful car ever. Nearly 17 million cars were produced . between 1908 and 1927 -  a period when car ownership was far . less widespread than it is today. Sporting pedigree: Corollas won Toyota the World Rally Championships Manufacturers Title in 1999 . Like the Model T the Corolla succeeds because it is inexpensive to buy, inexpensive to operate, reliable and easy to repair. Early Corollas were rear-wheel drive while later models were mostly front-wheel drive and some models were four-wheel drive. The greatest: Boxer Muhammed Ali promotes the Corrolla at a press conference in London in 1980 . Although always regarded as sensible rather than sporty the Corolla has had some racing pedigree. In . 1999 Toyota entered Corollas driven by Carlos Sainz and Didier Auriol . into the World Rally Championship subsequently winning the manufacturers . title. Despite concerns that the earthquake . and Tsunami which hit Japan last year would seriously damage production, Toyota, which is Japan's largest vehicle manufacturer, has posted surprisingly upbeat sales predictions for next year. The firm lifted its 2012 domestic . sales forecast to 1.63 million vehicles, up 6.5 percent from its . previous prediction and 36 percent higher than 2011, after the . government last month decided to re-introduce subsidies for . fuel-efficient cars. It is expected to be among the . biggest beneficiaries of such green car incentives and subsidies thanks . to its broad line-up of hybrid vehicles, including the Aqua, its . cheapest and most fuel-efficient hybrid to date, launched late last . month. The company's forecast for 18 percent . sales growth overseas was unchanged, bringing the global forecast to . 8.58 million vehicles, up 21 percent on the previous year, excluding . Daihatsu and Hino. That would be a record for the . company, whose sales slipped 6 percent to 7.1 million vehicles in 2011, . hampered by the massive earthquake in northeast Japan and Thai flooding. Earlier this week on a visit to the Washington Auto show President Barack Obama hailed the rebound of the U.S. car industry. A Ford F1 truck from 1948 (left) and a modern F-150 (right). The F series was the best selling vehicle for 28 years and remains the best selling truck of all time . Volkswagen's Golf (left) and Beetle (Right) are in third and fourth place respectively . Obama sat inside shiny new plug-in electric hybrids and burly trucks declaring, 'The U.S. auto industry is back.' As Mitt Romney surged ahead in Florida's GOP primary, Obama emphasised his administration's rescue of General Motors and Chrysler from the brink of collapse rival. The President told reporters it was 'good to remember the fact that there were some folks who were willing to let this industry die. Because of folks coming together we are now back at a place where we can compete with any car company in the world.' Who's that coming up behind me?

Russia's Prime Minister was told exactly what his opponents think of him today when they unravelled a huge banner saying 'Putin, go away' on a rooftop facing the Kremlin. A picture of Vladimir Putin, his face crossed out with an X, stared out from the black-and-yellow banner across the iced-over Moscow River towards the seat of Russian power. Police quickly removed the banner - put up in protest at his plans to return to the presidency, currently occupied by Dmitry Medvedev, in an election next month. Provocative: A picture of Vladimir Putin, his face crossed out with an X, stares out from the black-and-yellow banner across the iced-over Moscow River towards the Kremlin . Controversial: The banner, which was one of the first displays of anti-government so close to the Kremlin, was quickly taken down by police . Posters and chants urging Putin to give up power are common at demonstrations, sparked by claims of fraud in his party's favour in a parliamentary election in December. But the banner, which bore the logo of the opposition movement Solidarity, is one of just a few such big displays near the Kremlin since he came to power in 2000. Pavel Yelizarov, a Solidarity activist who stood in the cold on the embankment near the building, said: 'We think 12 years under Putin's rule is more than enough.' A Solidarity leader, Ilya Yashin, said the banner faced the Kremlin because 'Putin was and remains the master of the Kremlin.' Old guard: Opponents are angry that Russian . Prime Minister Vladimir Putin (left) is set to return as President, . taking over from the current leader Dmitry Medvedev (right) in next . month's election . Support: Baristas in Moscow have been getting into the election spirit by creating Putin portraits, with cinnamon and cocoa powder, on top of cappuccinos . He wrote on his blog: 'He is the . constructor and ideologue of the political system that has destroyed . competition in this country.' Putin . angered middle-class urban Russians eager for change when he announced . plans in September to return to the presidency, which he held from . 2000-2008, in the election. Polls indicate he will win a six-year term despite a decline in popularity and the biggest opposition protests of his rule, which are set to continue with a march in central Moscow on Saturday. Putin has promised limited political concessions but has at times ridiculed the protests and accused their leaders of being in the pay of the United States and Europe. Yelizarov added: 'We realised that the authorities are not listening to our protests, even after many thousands of people gathered. We're looking for new forms (of protest) demanding Putin leave office.' Yashin said activists put up the banner - which was affixed to a billboard atop a seven-storey building - after climbing a fire stair and quickly left when they were done.

John Lawrence Randall - known as Laurie - is the grand age of 102. He first had his left hip replaced in 1989. The determined pensioner wanted to have the two-hour operation so he could continue his passion for gardening. Standing tall: Laurie Randall with his granddaughter Gillian Coates. She said he was very determined . His granddaughter Gillian Coates, said: 'Even at 101 he was still digging up his garden and he decided on the hip replacement so he could continue with that. 'It will be a struggle for him to do . the gardening but he still says the operation was worth the risk because . at least he can stand up and walk around which he enjoys. He was never . very good at sitting still.' His feat could earn him a place in the Guinness Book of World Records, as the current record holder is Lily Wauters, who was 101 years and 196 days old when she had her right hip replaced in 2007. Ms Coates, said that Laurie, of Pontefract, West Yorkshire had also had his right hip replaced in 2006 and had 'true Yorkshire determination'. 'The operation was a fantastic success and we are very proud of him,' said Gillian. 'He has always said: ""I tell my legs what to do, they don’t tell me"". He wants to live until he is 105, but he said he didn’t want to do it if he was going to be in a wheelchair.' Success: Laurie is keen to get back to his garden . Laurie, who has since moved to Durham to be closer to his family, has just had his final post-operation check up at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, West Yorks. Ms Coates added that the record-breaking op was made even more dangerous as the hip Laurie was having replaced was artificial. Gillian said: 'Doctors told him that removing an artificial hip was much more complex than removing a natural hip as the full structure needs to come out. 'He was still undetered despite having the risks spelled out to him. He said he was talking with the surgeons throughout the process. 'He always says you should just try things and have a go. It was that attitude that spurred him on to risk his life and have the surgery. 'We didn't try to talk him out of it as there would have been no point. Once he has set his mind to something that's it.'","He has true Yorkshire determination, says granddaughter .

Clarence Avant, former chairman of Motown Records, said: 'Don Cornelius' legacy to music, especially black music, will be forever cemented in history. 'Soul Train was the first and only television show to showcase and put a spotlight on black artists at a time when there were few African-Americans on television at all, and that was the great vision of Don.' On his blog, music mogul Russell Simmons called Cornelius 'one of the greatest music legends there was'. Unexpected: The LAPD maintained a presence outside Don Cornelius's Mulholland Drive home in today after he apparently committed suicide in the early hours of the morning . He wrote: 'Don Cornelius gave artists . who had been segregated from most mainstream vehicles of expression a . chance to perform in front of a huge national audience. 'It was a tremendous opportunity that . changed their careers and the whole music industry. To win a Soul Train . Music Award meant that the most sophisticated tastemakers in the world . loved your work.' When Soul Train began in 1970, there was little indication it would become a long-running success - as only a handful of TV stations initially were receptive. Cornelius said in 2006: 'When we rolled it out, there were only . eight takers. 'There was just, ''We don't want it. We pass'', with race going unmentioned. No . one was blatant enough to say that.' Soul Train arrived at . a time when the U.S. was changing thanks to the civil rights . movement lead by Martin Luther King, political upheaval and cultural swings. It was one of the first shows to showcase African-Americans prominently, although the dance group was racially mixed. It showcased legendary artists like Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye and Barry White and brought the best R&B, soul and later hip-hop to TV. Soul Train, with its trademark opening . of an animated chugging train, also made Cornelius, a former DJ, a star. The dancers soon became as much of an attraction as the music. They made the 'Soul Train' dance - where people lined up on two sides and others sashayed . down the middle to show off their moves  - a cultural flashpoint. Earvin 'Magic' Johnson also cited Cornelius' business acumen. The former basketball player wrote on Twitter: 'Don Cornelius was the first African-American to create, produce, host and more importantly OWN his own show. Johnson added: Soul Train taught the world how to dance!' In his later years, Cornelius had a troubled marriage. In 2008, Cornelius was arrested at his Mulholland Drive home on suspicion of domestic violence. He appeared in court on November 14, 2008 charged with spousal abuse and pleaded not guilty before changing his plea to no contest the next year and was placed on 36 months probation. Cornelius' second wife, Viktoria Chapman-Cornelius, a Russian model, filed for divorce in 2007. She had filed two restraining orders against her former husband while Cornelius claimed she pepper-sprayed him many times, according to TMZ. Soul Train was a dance-variety show . which ran for 35 years, beginning in Chicago as a local . program and aired nationally from 1971 to 2006. Don Cornelius was credited with . helping break down racial barriers and broaden the reach of black . culture with funky music, groovy dance steps and the cutting-edge style . of the show. Over the years, artists including . Michael Jackson, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Patti LaBelle, Marvin . Gaye and Barry White appeared on the series. The series was created by Don Cornelius, who was both its host and executive producer. It holds the title of the longest, continuously running syndicated program on TV. Cornelius also created the Soul Train Awards, which would become a key honor for musicians. The series also spawned the Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards and the Soul Train Christmas Starfest. He was known for his catchphrase at the end of every show: '...you can bet your last money, it's all gonna be a stone gas, honey! I'm Don Cornelius, and as always in parting, we wish you love, peace and soul!' Cornelius stepped down as Soul Train host in 1993. The producer, who has a star on the . Hollywood Walk of Fame, said in 2006 he remained grateful to the . musicians who made Soul Train. He said: 'I figured as long as the music stayed hot and important and good, that there would always be a reason for Soul Train.' Donald Cortez Cornelius was born on September 27, . 1936, in Chicago. He had two sons with his first wife Delores.

After the cull of judges and presenters from the X Factor USA, it's hardly surprising that Simon Cowell wants a world-class diva sitting on that panel this year. But even he might have set his sights somewhat high after it was reported that the music mogul is after Mariah Carey. Cowell is believed to be trying to convince the singer to be one of the judges on the second series of the show after she was unable to take part last year having just given birth to her twins. In high demand: Simon Cowell, seen here arriving at the Britain's Got Talent auditions in Manchester last week,  has set his sights on Mariah Carey to join the new judging panel on the next series of X Factor USA . A source told The Mirror: 'Simon wants nothing but the best for the X Factor - and Mariah is the best.' But her husband Nick Cannon is believed to not be very keen on the idea and indicated that she will turn down the role. He is reported as saying: 'Why would my wife want to be on a show like that? For somebody who has a legendary career, I don't know why they would.' Yesterday it was revealed that Nicole Scherzinger and host Steve Jones have been unceremoniously dumped from the X Factor USA after just one season. Could these two be coming on board? Cowell is believed to want Nicki Minaj and Katy Perry on the panel too . Reports today have suggested that Katy . Perry and Nicki Minaj are also in Cowell's sights to join Mariah on the . panel for the new series - and Dermot O'Leary, who presents the Uk . version, has an outside chance of taking over from Steve Jones. Cowell also recently admitted that despite axing her from the show last May, he would take Cheryl Cole back on board. He . said: 'I regret what happened because Cheryl was a close friend. I've . always believed we'll end up doing something together again.' Humble pie: Simon said he regretted sacking Cheryl Cole from last year's show and she would be very welcome to come back this year . 'She could be a panellist again if she wanted to - 100 per cent. I don't know if she would. I think she probably misses me.' His former darling Paula Abdul confirmed yesterday she had also been fired from the panel in a desperate shake-up by the mogul and the show's producers. 'Yes, it’s true; I won’t be returning to The X Factor next season,' Abdul said in a statement today. 'I’ve learned through my longevity in this industry that business decisions often times override personal considerations. Could Tulisa be vying for a role stateside? The X . Factor UK judge arrived in LA yesterday as it was announced Nicole . Scherzinger, Steve Jones and Paula Abdul had been axed . She continued: 'Simon is, and will . remain a dear friend of mine and I’ve treasured my experience working . this past season. I want nothing more than for The X Factor to exceed . ALL of their wildest dreams. This truly has been a blessing and I am . most grateful.' Cowell, who first worked with Abdul on . American Idol, wants to re-boot the show after its ratings fell short of . expectations when it was launched last year. The decision to dismiss Abdul has surprised many, given how hard Cowell worked to secure her on the panel. 'I want to say a massive thank you to Paula, Nicole and Steve for being part of The X Factor last year. 'We had a lot of fun making the show together and importantly, we found some real talent and stars. 'You do develop friendships with the people you work with and Paula, in particular, is a very close friend and I expect to be working with her on another project in the near future. 'I'm sure all three are going to have massive success in what they do next , but now is the time to thank them all for everything they did last year.' It took several months for her contract to negotiated and she only closed her deal hours before the first televised audition. 'You just have to get that chemistry, and she’s right,' he said at the time. 'I’ve never found anyone better than her.' Both Abdul and Scherzinger were . embroiled in the controversy surrounding the shock elimination of . 13-year-old frontrunner Rachel Crow. Cowell hinted at a major changes on the show last month when he was . quoted as saying: 'We change these shows all the time.' And he said in a statement today: 'I want to say a massive thank you to Paula, Nicole and Steve for being part of The X Factor last year.  I'm sure all three are going to have massive success in what they do next , but now is the time to thank them all for everything they did last year.' Although the X Factor performed solidly . in the ratings, hovering around the 12 million mark, it did not attract the same kind of huge viewing figures . regularly attained by Cowell's former show American Idol. Cowell had also recently . admitted that that he may have been overconfident when it came to the . American version of his hit show, after ratings did not reach his 20 million prediction. He said he became ‘a bit too cocky' last year and admitted the slumping viewing figures had 'put my ego in check'. Record executive L.A. Reid, who has previously worked with Mariah Carey, Pink, Justin Bieber, Rihanna, survived the cut.

"By . Graham Smith . Last updated at 4:33 PM on 2nd February 2012 . Harry Redknapp fought back tears in court today as he fiercely denied telling his tax evasion trial 'a pack of lies'. The football boss shouted from the witness box at prosecutor John Black QC: 'You think I put my hand on the bible and told lies? That's an insult, Mr Black, that's an insult.' Bespectacled Redknapp shook his head as Mr Black ended his cross-examination at Southwark Crown Court, in London, by saying: 'I suggest you have been telling the court a pack of lies.' With a voice trembling with emotion, Redknapp replied: 'Everything I have told you is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God.' On trial: Harry Redknapp, pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court with his son Jamie today, has admitted 'plucking the wrong figure' out of the air as he was quizzed by Premier League bung investigators . Earlier in the day, the football boss . admitted he 'plucked the wrong figure' out of the air as he was quizzed . by Premier League bung investigators. The Tottenham Hotspur manager denied . prosecution claims he 'desperately' tried to cover up allegations that . £189,000 payments into a Monaco bank account were bonuses for transfer . profits.# . Redknapp told the court: 'I wasn’t sure what the sum . was,' when he first mentioned the account to Quest Premier . League bung investigators. When asked if he plucked a figure out of the air, Redknapp replied: 'I did and I plucked the wrong figure, didn’t I?' He said that if he had not told the Quest inquiry about the Monaco account the issue would be 'dead'. Co-accused: Milan Mandaric denies two counts of cheating the public revenue while chairman at Portsmouth FC . Other football managers did not voluntarily declare accounts, he told the jury. Redknapp said: 'As I have said many times, if I don't go to Quest and tell them about that account, nobody knows.' The 2006 Quest investigation into English football was led by Lord Stevens, the former Metropolitan Police Commissioner. 'Half the managers didn't even tell them,' Redknapp said. 'If I didn't tell them it's dead.' On the stand for a second day, . Redknapp also revealed that he deliberately gave News of the World . sports journalist Rob Beasley the wrong information to prevent a story . appearing in the Sunday tabloid on the day Spurs were to take on . Manchester United in the 2009 League Cup final. He . said: 'I don’t have to tell Mr Beasley the truth. I have to tell police . the truth, not Mr Beasley, he’s a News of the World reporter.' When asked why he referred to payments he was due for the sale of striker Peter Crouch from Portsmouth to Aston Villa as bonuses, Redknapp added: 'I wanted to make the point to Mr Beasley that it was paid by my chairman.' He added: 'I referred to it to him many times as my Crouch bonus [as] Crouch is an easy answer.' Redknapp added: 'I just want to get Mr Beasley out the way - I just didn’t want a story in the paper... 'I was going to come down to breakfast and all my players were going to be looking at the back page of the News of the World. It was going to be embarrassing.' Redknapp said 'I am not a liar' but giving Mr Beasley the wrong information was 'the easy way out'. John Black QC, for the prosecution, accused Redknapp of 'letting the cat out of the bag' during the phone conversation. Redknapp replied: 'Why would I let the cat out of the bag to the News of the World if I had done anything wrong? 'Do you think me and Mr (Milan) Mandaric are going to have completely different stories. Are we that stupid?' Old times: Mandaric gets to grips with Redknapp when the pair were chairman and manager of Portsmouth FC respectively . When asked again why he had offered a . 'false story' to Mr Beasley, Redknapp, wearing tortoise-shell glasses . and a navy blue suit, added: 'I just want to get him off my back. This . is the easy way out for me before a Cup Final.' The payments were linked to Crouch 'in my mind', Redknapp added. 'In my mind it was always related to Crouch even though it wasn’t connected. 'I felt morally I was due that money even though legally I wasn’t.' Tape recordings of Redknapp talking to Mr Beasley were played in court. Mr Black focused on Redknapp saying, 'Well, what did he give it to me for then?' when Mr Beasley said Mandaric claimed the payments were an investment, not a bonus. Mr Black asked earlier if Redknapp was 'desperately trying to hide' that it was a bonus. Redknapp replied: 'Absolutely not.' When asked if he had been misleading, Redknapp repeated: 'Absolutely not.' He went on to say: 'You could be under the illusion (it was a bonus) but you would be wrong.' The defendant was asked about the £300,000 he received outside his contract at West Ham United for the sale of Rio Ferdinand to Leeds United. When asked whether responsibility for paying the tax was the club’s, Redknapp replied: 'Yes.' Both former Portsmouth boss Redknapp, of Dorset, and Mandaric, 73, of Leicestershire, deny two counts of cheating the public revenue.","Tottenham Hotspur manager denies 'desperately' trying to cover up allegations that .

"Suni Faith Anderson jailed for up to 15 years . Victim's mother stood up and blasted Suni in court . By . Paul Thompson . Last updated at 4:53 PM on 2nd February 2012 . A personal trainer collapsed in court after she was jailed for having sex with a 14-year-old boy during a two year affair. Suni Faith Anderson fainted and hit her head on a table after Judge Eric Ludlow told her she would serve up to 15 years. Anderson, 36, was revived by court staff and wept as she was led away from a court in St George, Utah. Personal trainer Suni Faith Anderson was sentenced to 15 years in jail for having sex with a client, 14, during workout sessions at his home. The sentence came despite pleas for leniency from Anderson's husband . Earlier her teen victim's mother had stood up in court and blasted Anderson for corrupting her son. 'This is a picture of my son when he was 14 years old,' the victim's mother said while holding up a photo of her son. 'Look. Suni, look! Does this look like someone a 34-year-old adult woman would want to have a relationship with?' The mother later called Anderson 'the worst kind of paedophile'. She revealed police had secretly recorded Anderson telling her son 'Well, you learned a whole lot, didn't you?' Anderson's husband Jason, who had pleaded for leniency, was in court to see his wife jailed. The victim's mother blasted her court and held up a photo of her 'corrupted' teenage son . The personal trainer began a sexual relationship with the boy, then aged 14, when he visited her home for training sessions. The affair lasted two years until the boy's parents found about the relationship and contacted police. The teen gave evidence against his former lover and told how everyone in his school knew about the affair. 'I . have to walk through the halls of my high school knowing that people . know what happened, wondering what they’re thinking,' he said. The . teen said Anderson had made sexual advances towards him before they . slept together when he would visit her house for fitness sessions. Andersen pleaded guilty in November to two second-degree felony counts of forcible sexual abuse. As part of a plea deal, eight other felony counts were dismissed. She was jailed for one to 15 years and will be placed on a register of sex offenders. Her husband, also a personal trainer, had told the court they had lost several jobs since her arrest and were no longer allowed to work with youths.","Suni Faith Anderson jailed for up to 15 years .

"By . James Chapman . Last updated at 12:53 AM on 2nd February 2012 . More to follow suit? Tories don't want former RBS chief Fred Goodwin (above) to be the last banker to be stripped of a knighthood . Tories demanded further action against failed bankers yesterday following the decision to strip Fred Goodwin of his knighthood. MPs called for more financiers, including colleagues of Mr Goodwin at Royal Bank of Scotland, to lose the right to be called Sir. But others condemned the action against Mr Goodwin, with business leaders claiming it amounted to hysteria. Mr Goodwin’s friend, motor racing champion Sir Jackie Stewart, said he thought the former bank boss had been made a scapegoat while former Chancellor Alistair Darling said the decision to take way his title was tawdry. RBS had to be bailed out with £45billion of taxpayers’ money after Mr Goodwin steered it to the biggest corporate disaster in British history. Senior figures in Downing Street have also discussed attempting to strip him of his massive pension. Mr Goodwin, whose knighthood was annulled on Monday by order of the Queen, is still receiving what is effectively a tax- payer-funded pension of £342,500 a year for life from RBS. Some Tories want to tackle him about his pension in the expectation that he would challenge such a move using the Human Rights Act. This would boost public opposition to the Act which they want to replace with a British Bill of Rights. There were also calls for peers who have committed crimes to lose their titles. However, business leaders protested at the removal of Mr Goodwin’s knighthood on the recommendation of a secretive Whitehall committee, claiming it was ‘hysteria’. And former chancellor Mr Darling claimed the decision was ‘tawdry’. He added: ‘There were other knights of the realm on the board – are we going after them?’ Former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson backed the decision on Mr Goodwin. ‘You can say “why pick him out?” but every schoolmaster knows sometimes it’s necessary to make an example,’ he said. ‘I don’t think anybody can have the slightest sympathy for Mr Goodwin, who through a mixture of vanity, greed and sheer incompetence presided over the biggest banking disaster in British history.’ Michael Fallon, deputy chairman of the Conservative Party and a member of the Treasury select committee, insisted: ‘This has not been done on a whim…this is three and a half years after the downfall of RBS and follows a very detailed report from the Financial Services Authority that details the exact role that Fred Goodwin played.’ Tory MPs last night called for Sir Victor Blank and Sir James Crosby to lose their knighthoods for their roles in the merger of Lloyds and HBOS during the financial crisis. Sir Victor was chairman of Lloyds TSB when it merged with HBOS in 2009. In the firing line: The Tories have called for former Lloyds TSB chairman Sir Victor Blank (left) and former HBOS chief executive Sir James Crosby to lose their knighthoods for their roles in the merger of the two banks . Sir James was chief executive of HBOS until 2006 before becoming deputy chairman of the FSA. One Tory said: ‘These guys were on the last helicopter out of Saigon. So we are going after them. ‘Victor Blank agreed to take over HBOS as a favour to Gordon Brown. ‘There will be an FSA report on that next year. It won’t be the  same plane crash of awfulness  that was RBS. But it will still be pretty bad.’ Mr Fallon hinted that further knighthoods could be stripped: ‘There is going to a report now from the FSA into the HBOS-Lloyds disintegration. So who knows what will follow from that?’ The affair also led to broader calls for reform of the honours system. Exchequer exchange: Former Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling (left) branded the decision to remove Mr Goodwin's 'tawdry', but former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson (right) said it was necessary to set an example . Labour leader Ed Miliband, who insisted his party had been wrong to nominate Mr Goodwin for his honour for ‘services to banking’ in 2004, told the Daily Mail: ‘I think there’s got to be caution exercised about who gets honours now. ‘The circumstances in which people can have these honours revoked at the moment are pretty narrow – it’s breaking the law and professional misconduct. ‘But if you damage the British economy or society, you shouldn’t be able to keep such a privilege.’ Mr Miliband said ordinary people, not civil servants, should decide whether to give or revoke honours. He added: ‘You need a wider cross . section than civil servants – people from civic life, church leaders, . those representing consumers, people from business, actually, who would . probably be near the front of the queue of saying it’s not good to have . somebody who brings business into disrepute.’ Downing Street indicated it may look . at ways of stripping peers of their titles where they have been . convicted of crimes, a view backed yesterday by Scotland’s First . Minister Alex Salmond. Shamed: High-profile figures who have lost their knighthoods since World War Two . Peers . including Lord Archer, Lord Hanningfield and Lord Taylor have all been . jailed but have been allowed to return to the House of Lords. ‘Why are . they still in a legislature?’ said Mr Salmond, who was close to Mr . Goodwin. He admitted he now regretted his strong support for the banker. Former . Formula 1 motor racing world champion Sir Jackie Stewart – a close . friend of Mr Goodwin – said he thought the former bank boss had been . made a scapegoat. ‘No single person or even any single bank created the . biggest financial recession in modern times,’ he said. ‘To have this (knighthood) stripped is poor for the constitution and very dangerous for the future.’ In . the Commons, David Cameron and Mr Miliband traded blows as the Labour . leader called for banks to be forced to disclose how many executives . earn more than £1million. He said the Government was ‘part of the . problem’ on executive pay. Bank . bosses have been ordered to step up efforts to claw back bonuses paid . to executives involved in the mis-selling of payment protection . insurance to millions of customers.

Britain's biggest broadband suppliers are failing to deliver by providing speeds half as fast as advertised, a study revealed today. Providers like Sky, Orange, BT and PlusNet all delivered actual broadband speeds which were half as fast as their advertised packages. An Ofcom study found that Sky, who advertise 20mb broadband, had an average actual speed as low as 6.3mb, while PlusNet's 8mb package in reality delivered speeds as low as 3.7mb. Slow coach: Broadband packages from Sky, BT, PlsuNet and Orange are falling well short of their advertised speeds, according to Ofcom . However, firms like Virgin who offered super-fast broadband of up to 30mb were hitting their promised targets. Virgin's 50mb meanwhile offered an impressive average of 48.8mb. The Ofcom study also found a huge difference in performance between BT's faster and slower broadband packages. Its new £18 a month Infinity service promising speeds of up to 40mb averaged 36mb, whereas households on its 20mb deal for £14 a month had to endure a sluggish 8mb. Those on Karoo's 24mb broadband averaged download speeds of 7.4mb - less than a third of the speed advertised. Ofcom chief executive, Ed Richards said: 'There is a real opportunity for consumers to look at the packages and deals in their area in order to receive the best value, speeds and performance available to them.' A spokesperson for BT said the difference in speeds was due to the speed difference between fibre optic and copper cables. The spokesperson said: 'There are other factors involved like the distance of the house from the exchange and even the wiring in the home. 'We make it clear to customers what speed they can expect depending on where they live before they sign up. 'No customer should be in any doubt as to the likely speed that they should expect from our service. 'We provide comprehensive broadband services at great value where speed is important.' Ofcom found the average speed across Britain was 7.6Mb in November compared with 6.2Mb in 2010. New guidelines will be introduced in April meaning suppliers will have to be more accurate with the speeds they advertise.","BT, Orange, and Sky all fail to deliver on advertised broadband speeds ."
"By . Paul Harris . Last updated at 12:25 PM on 2nd February 2012 . Smile: Harry Redknapp arriving at court yesterday . His full name was Henry James Redknapp but everyone in court knew him as ’Arry. He made a final adjustment to his dark blue suit and put one hand on each side of the witness box. Then, for more than two hours, the man tipped as the next England football manager took centre stage in a tax-evasion trial upon which his proud reputation is staked. It began as the Harry Redknapp show – a testimony delivered in high-speed Cockney, punctuated by laughter and one-liners. Among them was the claim that he had been too busy ‘thinking about who was marking David Beckham’ in his Portsmouth team’s match against Manchester United to pay attention to a form he signed transferring money into his Monaco account in 2003. But the mood turned sour when he accused a police officer of staring at him in court – and clashed with a prosecution lawyer in heated exchanges under cross-examination. Just two minutes of the Spurs and former Portsmouth supremo’s evidence at Southwark Crown Court had elapsed before he cut through the legal niceties to tell the jury: ‘I’ve always paid my tax. I’d rather pay too much tax than too little.’ And no, he insisted, the 100,000 dollars his friend and former chairman Milan Mandaric set up for him in an offshore account in Monaco was certainly not a bung. This was the first time East London-born Redknapp, 64, had the opportunity to explain in person to a jury why he is not guilty of trying to cheat the public purse by avoiding tax on the money. He told of how he became employed at Portsmouth by Mandaric after leaving West Ham in 2001. 'Paid too much': Harry Redknapp, seen leaving Southwark Crown Court, said he hired the best people to make sure he paid his taxes correctly . It was a meeting over a cup of tea in a . hotel in the New Forest which secured him a job he loved; a contract . eventually worth a total of £4.3million; and eventually a place in the . dock next to the billionaire businessman who became his friend, . benefactor and co-accused. The offshore ‘investment’ Mandaric made for Redknapp is at the centre of the tax evasion charges. he . Crown says the money Mandaric paid into the Monaco account was a bonus . for the £3million profit Portsmouth reaped from selling striker Peter . Crouch for £4million, and that tax should therefore have been paid in . the UK. Under a . previous contract, Redknapp would have been paid 10 per cent of the . transfer fee for Crouch’s sale. But the contract had recently been . revamped to give Redknapp higher wages and bonuses but 5 per cent of the . transfer fee. Co-accused: Milan Mandaric, pictured arriving at court, denied that Redknapp was 'greedy' Redknapp . was ‘not a happy bunny’ afterwards, he agreed. The Crown says the . Monaco money was to compensate his loss – a claim which both men deny. Redknapp agreed yesterday he had travelled to Monaco with his wife Sandra to set up the account. Much of his time was taken up by a bank official talking about Fulham Football Club, he said. He . declined the bank’s offer of taking the paperwork away with him, he . said, telling the jury: ‘It would have been a waste of time giving me a . load of forms. 'I would probably have left them on the deckchair when me and Sandra went to the beach in the afternoon.’ Fans . of Redknapp queued for seats in a packed public gallery yesterday as he . gave evidence a few yards from the gaze of his football pundit son . Jamie. One spectator denied a seat peered through binoculars from outside. Inside, . the man himself provoked laughter from lawyers, jurors and the Press as . he answered questions from his barrister John Kelsey-Fry, QC. Managing: Redknapp was back to the day job as he was on the touchline for his Tottenham side's win over Wigan Athletic on Tuesday night . But . the mood changed when he pointed to Detective Inspector David Manley in . the well of the court and barked: ‘Mr Manley, would you stop staring at . me? I know you are trying to cause me a problem.’ Redknapp then turned to Judge Anthony Leonard and apologised. Under . cross-examination by prosecution QC John Black, he again appeared to . lose his temper when asked if he knew how much money Mandaric had paid . into the Monaco account, named Rosie 47 after Redknapp’s dog and his . year of birth. Old times: Milan Mandaric gets to grips with Harry Redknapp when the pair were respectively chairman and manager of Portsmouth FC . Redknapp . insisted he had ‘no idea, not a clue’ about what had gone into or out . of the account, and hadn’t asked Mandaric about it. Mr . Black then pointed out Redknapp had told the Quest Investigation into . football corruption in November 2006 that he thought there was about . £120,000 in it. Redknapp said: ‘I can’t remember where I got that figure.’ He pointed out the figure was incorrect. Redknapp . also said Sandra, his wife of 44 years, was terrified when police set . off the burglar alarm in an early-hours raid at the couple’s luxury home . at Sandbanks, Dorset, in 2007, while he was away watching a match in . Germany. He said: ‘My wife thought I had probably been killed in a plane crash.’ Both Redknapp and Mandaric deny two charges of cheating the public purse. The trial continues.","Tottenham Hotspur manager: I pay too much tax rather than too little .

"By . Charles Walford . Last updated at 12:47 PM on 2nd February 2012 . Exit: Truett Tate is the last remaining executive with links to the ill-fated takeover of HBOS in 2008 . A fresh row over ‘rewards for failure’ could be brewing after it emerged Lloyds Banking group is preparing to give its investment banking chief a £4.8million 'golden goodbye'. The farewell package for Truett Tate, who will step down from the state-controlled bank this month, could be five times higher than the bonus waived by Stephen Hester at Royal Bank of Scotland earlier this week. It comes just a week after the Prime Minister said rewards for failure made 'people’s blood boil' when – in the words of Bank of England Governor Mervyn King– hard-up Britons were suffering ‘a ferocious squeeze’. Mr Tate, 61, who is American, joined in 2003 and heads Lloyds' wholesale division. He was a main board director of the bank in 2008 under the ill-fated leadership of Eric Daniels and is thought to have voted in favour of the catastrophic decision to buy HBOS. That meant the banking giant needed to be rescued with £20.3billion of public money – the state now owns 41 per cent of the bank - on which taxpayers are facing an £11.5billion paper loss because shares have fallen by 57 per cent since then. In October 2010 Mr Tate told the BBC that despite the economic turmoil triggered by the banking crisis, the taxpayer should be delighted with its 'investment' into his bank. Mr Tate, who earned £1.8m in 2009, said: 'There are a whole lot of people, myself included, who would love to get the kind of return on their investment that the taxpayer has made into this bank. 'They've made an investment that is making money. If you could come up with me, with an investment in the infrastructure which would have returned more for the taxpayers, I'm all ears.' Former RBS chief Fred Goodwin was earlier this week stripped of his knighthood for bringing the financial system into disrepute. The Cabinet Office said RBS’s failure, which cost taxpayers £45billion, helped ‘trigger the worst recession in the UK since the Second World War’. Meanwhile, David Cameron . said a seven-figure bonus for Mr Goodwin's successor Mr Hester would be unacceptable. The boss . of state-owned RBS then waived his annual bonus of nearly £1million. It remains to be seen whether Mr Tate will follow suit. Mr Tate, who works in Lloyds’ London headquarters, is leaving as part of a shake-up of the board 'old guard' who served under Eric Daniels. RBS CEO Stephen Hester (left) waived his £963,000 bonus in shares after David Cameron said 'rewards for failure' made 'people’s blood boil' Truett Tate joined Lloyds Banking in 2003 as managing director, corporate banking, before being appointed to the board in 2004. He later became group executive director of wholesale and international banking. He worked at Citigroup from 1972 to 1999, where he held a number of senior and general management appointments in the USA, South America, Asia and Europe. After leaving Citi he was president and chief executive officer of eCharge Corporation from 1999 to 2001. He was also co-founder and vice chairman of the board of Chase Cost Management Inc from 1996 to 2003. He has also held a variety of directorships and non-executive directorships.Compensation for 2009Salary                                    £640,000Bonus                                 £1,120,000All other compensation              £47,000Total Compensation              £1,807,000 . Source: Forbes.com . His . exit is part of a strategy that Lloyds' boss Antonio Horta-Osorio hopes . will allow the bank to 'move to the next phase of Lloyds' transformation'. He is expected to get a 12-month pay-off . based on his basic salary, which was £656,000 last year, according to The Times. Pension . contributions will push this to £816,000, but the bank would not divulge . further likely payments. He has rights to £2.821million worth of shares in the bank as part of a bonus scheme yet to crystallise, while other payouts could push the total to almost £5million. Mr Tate will be replaced temporarily by Andrew Géczy, who runs the wholesale banking and markets, while a permanent replacement is sought. Mr Horta-Osorio is overhauling the bank's management team in a bid to ease the burden on him following a period of sick leave. There will be 10 people reporting to the chief executive, compared with 14 previously, after retail director Alison Brittain was given more responsibility and a new role of group corporate functions director was announced. Mr Horta-Osorio recently said he would pass more responsibility on to his senior managers after stress-related exhaustion forced him to take two months off, which created uncertainty over the bank's leadership, sending shares in Lloyds tumbling to record lows. The changes announced today will not only allow him to spend more time with staff, but are also part of his vision to turn around the taxpayer-backed bank and restore its sense of pride, he said. The group's corporate functions director, who has yet to be appointed, will focus on areas such as human resources, legal and secretariat and group audit that are 'essential to transforming the group', whereas these directors previously reported to the chief executive. Antonio Horta-Osorio has overhauled the management team at Lloyds Banking Group, forcing the departure of Mr Tate . And Ms Brittain, who currently runs . Lloyds TSB and Bank of Scotland Community banks, will also take on . responsibility for the Halifax Community Bank. Miguel-Angel Rodriguez-Sola, director . of special projects, will take on the new position of retail strategy . and commercial director and will also report to her. Mr Horta-Osorio said: 'We have an . experienced and committed management team and I am sure that we will, . over time, achieve our aim of being the best bank for customers. 'By . doing that, we will provide our investors with sustainable returns and . our colleagues with a sense of real pride in the bank.' The Portuguese chief executive, who . recently waived his bonus as a result of his sick leave, has already . made numerous changes to the management team since his arrival in March, . as he stamped his authority on the business. His . previous overhaul saw the departures of Archie Kane, head of insurance . and Scotland, who retired, while retail head and most senior female . employee Helen Weir decided to leave. He . also split the insurance arm into two separate divisions, and appointed . fellow former Santander man Antonio Lorenzo as group director for the wealth . and international division. Shares in Lloyds rose 1 per cent in early trading today. Fred Goodwin was stripped of his knighthood for his role in the financial crisis . Tories demanded further action against failed bankers yesterday following the decision to strip Fred Goodwin of his knighthood. MPs called for more financiers, including colleagues of Mr Goodwin at Royal Bank of Scotland, to lose the right to be called Sir. But others condemned the action against Mr Goodwin, with business leaders claiming it amounted to hysteria. Mr Goodwin’s friend, motor racing champion Sir Jackie Stewart, said he thought the former bank boss had been made a scapegoat while former Chancellor Alistair Darling said the decision to take away his title was tawdry. Mark Field, Tory MP for the city of London, told The Times that stripping him of his knighthood was a 'witch-hunt' and it could even harm overseas business interests. RBS had to be bailed out with £45billion of taxpayers’ money after Mr Goodwin steered it to the biggest corporate disaster in British history. Senior figures in Downing Street have also discussed attempting to strip him of his massive pension. Mr Goodwin, whose knighthood was annulled on Monday by order of the Queen, is still receiving what is effectively a taxpayer-funded pension of £342,500 a year for life from RBS. Some Tories want to tackle him about his pension in the expectation that he would challenge such a move using the Human Rights Act. This would boost public opposition to the Act which they want to replace with a British Bill of Rights.

His unique venue may have made 'bin busker' Charlie Cavey an institution in Cambridge, but his incessant strumming appears to have caused a stink with students in the university city. Mr Cavey, who busks with his guitar from inside a litter bin outside the university's prestigious Corpus Christi College, has seen his venue vandalised during his most recent sets. Now university officials have stepped in to warn students, after the bin busker had bleach emptied into his bin and stink bombs let off inside while he was playing. College president James Black emailed . students yesterday warning saying that 'such acts of vigilantism and . vandalism are obviously unacceptable.' They . said offending students, who continued to harass Charlie, who plays in a . Cambridge City Council bin directly outside their college, would be . punished by the Dean. Mr . Cavey, 31, has been busking in Cambridge for 11 years, but says he . could have been blinded when vandals released a stink bomb into his bin . while he strummed away. He has recently bought himself a guard dog, who perches on top of his bin to guard his well-earned takings. He said: 'The problems started about a month ago when someone complained. 'Then I came back an hour later a whole bottle of bleach had been emptied into my bin. 'I only play for 20 minute sets, then have a 15 minute break and only do about six sets a day.' Cambridge University students have complained that Mr Cavey plays too loud, and that his six performances a day are too long. An email sent by James Black said: 'There have been a number of incidents involving students and this busker, most recently seeing fart bombs thrown into the bin during one of his performances, but also extending to the bin being attacked with bleach.' James Black said it was 'completely understandable' that some students found him 'a real nuisance' and there was evidence to suggest he regularly broke the Street Performer's Code of Practice by playing too loudly and for more than one hour a day. Local institution: The busker says his unusual choice of venue 'always makes people laugh' Upset: Students at Cambridge's prestigious Corpus Christi College have complained Mr Cavey's music is too loud and goes on for too long . But he said students should deal with the matter by alerting the council when he broke the code, rather than taking matters into their own hands. He said so far the city council had received very few official complaints so they were unable to move Charlie from his pitch. But he assured students 'the problem should hopefully be resolved well before exam term.'","Charlie Cavey has been busking in Cambridge for 11 years .

"By . Charles Walford . Last updated at 2:34 PM on 1st February 2012 . Ten border control staff were caught harbouring illegal immigrants while supposedly protecting the UK, it emerged today. In the past four years almost 60 UK Border Agency workers committed offences relating to their job. In the latest scandal to hit the agency, figures revealed that ten staff members were found to have protected illegal immigrants since 2008. Another 39 staff had been disciplined for abuse of position in relation to immigration misconduct and a further eight cited for organised activity. It has been revealed that 57 UK Border Agency workers committed offences relating to their job - including harbouring illegal immigrants . MigrationWatch called on tougher penalties for those caught after it emerged that only 23 of the 57 had been dismissed - and six let off completely. It is the latest in a series of damaging blows for the body charged with protecting Britain's borders. UKBA came under fire last year when it emerged that vital checks for criminals and terrorists were abandoned over the summer to help prevent congestion for holidaymakers at airports. Passport checks were relaxed nearly 2,500 times at airports this summer, according to leaked UK Border Agency emails. Speaking about the disciplinary  figures, Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch, said: 'This is potentially very serious. It is a clear reminder of the importance of keeping a watchful eye on border agency staff. 'We must be able to rely on those who protect our borders. For a start, tougher penalties are essential whenever wrong doing is discovered.' The statistics, released by the Home Office under the Freedom of Information Act, showed immigration offences committed by UK Border Agency staff since 2008. The agency, which employs 23,000 staff . around Britain, is charged with keeping our borders tight and stopping . the entrance of illegal immigrants. UKBA came under fire last year when it emerged that vital checks for criminals and terrorists were abandoned over the summer, forcing Brodie Clark to quite as head of the agency . Yet ten employees were caught . harbouring illegal immigrants, 39 found abusing their position and eight . involved in organised immigration activity. More . than half of those caught - 32 - were in Greater London, seven in the . southeast, three in the Midlands, one in the northeast and one in the . northwest. There was no location disclosed on 13 of the offenders of the crimes - 22 of which happened in 2010 alone. A total of 23 of the employees were sacked for their misdemeanours. Bosses gave a final formal warning to 19 and a first formal warning to nine. Six staff were let off without any form of punishment. Theresa May was accused by Brodie of blaming him for 'political convenience' over the border control fiasco . Reacting to the figure, the UK Border Agency said it took 'swift action' when employees were found breaking the law. A . spokesman said: 'We expect the highest standards of our staff and the . vast majority carry out their roles with professionalism and integrity. 'Any allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated and we take swift action when staff break the law. 'We have a dedicated unit of trained officers who work in close co-operation with the police to investigate any alleged criminality. 'We always refer allegations of corruption to the police.' Earlier this month The Commons Home Affairs Select Committee today urged a root-and-branch reform of the way the Home Office and UK Border Agency interact in order the make the agency fit for purpose. MPs said a 'highly-troubling' string of communication failures led to the UK's border checks being relaxed too frequently. The scandal cost the head of the agency, Brodie Clark, his job. He admitted using guidance designed for health and safety emergencies to suspend fingerprint checks at the UK's ports in action which had no ministerial authorisation. When the fiasco came to a head Mr Clark accused Home Secretary Theresa May of blaming him for 'political convenience', before quitting his post after 40 years at the Home Office. Damning documents also showed that thousands of passengers on private aircraft did not face passport checks at all. They also showed that fingerprint checks on foreign nationals who need a visa to enter the UK were relaxed on 164 occasions. Officials were also told to stop 'routinely checking' children from the EU 'against the Warnings Index', which is designed to weed out possible terrorists and criminal gangs. In one email, a UKBA official at Durham Tees Valley Airport raised concerns with managers, complaining: ‘We are not allowed to physically see the passengers arriving on private charter flights. 'It is creating a situation where we are not able to secure the borders as robustly as we would like, for no justifiable reason.’",Latest scandal at UKBA reveals 57 staff committed offences relating to their job .
"By . Graham Smith . Last updated at 8:21 AM on 2nd February 2012 . A mysterious blood-thirsty wild cat feared to have devoured at least six animals in the Gloucestershire countryside was today revealed to be a mere fox. DNA tests on two mutilated deer confirmed the killer's true identity. Last month, three wallabies were found on farmland stripped to the bone, with their internal organs neatly placed beside their bodies. Mutilated: One of three wallabies found devoured on farmland in the Cotswolds last month. What was thought to be a blood-thirsty wild cat roaming the Gloucestershire countryside was today revealed to be a mere fox . That find came soon after the discovery of the bodies of three deer in countryside near Stroud. Examinations revealed all the animals . had suffered puncture wounds to the neck, consistent with a vicious . attack by a panther-like creature. It was then claimed that the animals . were killed by the 'Wildcat of Woodchester', named after the national . park where its first prey was found. But eagerly awaited DNA results, . taken from the body of two of the deer, showed no big cat saliva and . pointed to a wily fox as the real culprit. Dr Robin Allaby, associate professor . at the School of Life Sciences at the University of Warwick, which . analysed the results, said: 'We did not detect cat DNA on either deer . carcass. 'Other than deer, by far the strongest genetic signal we found on the Woodchester Park carcass was from a fox. 'That fox DNA was found on the ribs, legs and plucking sites from the Woodchester deer carcass. 'On the second deer carcass we found . canid DNA. A more detailed analysis is underway to pin down the canid . species but our expectation is that that will also be fox DNA.' Red herring: This image of a large black animal in a field in north-west Wiltshire was thought to be the 'beast' stalking the Cotswolds . Real culprit: DNA tests on two mutilated deer confirmed the killer to be a fox (file picture) Big cat experts led the call for an . investigation into suspicious activity after a roe deer was found dead . in Woodchester Park on January 4. It had been torn open and was missing . its heart, kidneys and liver. Its snout was also missing, a . significant piece of information because big cats clamp their jaws over . the mouth, causing death by suffocation. Experts had believed the deer had . been brought down and devoured by a large and powerful predator such as a . puma, jaguar or leopard. Tufts of the animal's fur were also . found piled by the body - and such predators neatly pluck the hair from . the body before shearing their teeth into the flesh. Another deer carcass was found by a dog walker between Whiteway and Redcomb, near Cirencester - ten miles away - on January 10. A third roe deer body was found at a development in Cooper's Edge, near Gloucester, days later. Three wallabies, part of a private . collection, were also found dead by their devastated owner on January 6, . two days after his first kill at Woodchester Park. Examination: A man completes a DNA test on the carcass of one of the deer killed last month . Tests: This roe deer was killed less than 12 miles from where three wallabies were devoured . The Gloucestershire farmer, located 12 miles from the first attack, did not want to divulge his name or location. But he did release gory pictures of . one of the dead wallabies. The carcasses had been ripped open in a . similar way to the three roe deers the beast is believed to have slayed. Dr Robin Allaby took 45 samples from . the wounds of two of the deer carcasses with the aim of testing . specifically for DNA from the saliva. His team searched for more than 30 different types of big cat DNA in their sample. But their results will disappoint experts - who still insist that the beasts are stalking the British countryside. Rick Minter, a Gloucestershire big . cat expert who believed the 'Wildcat Of Woodchester' was on the prowl, . said: 'There has been speculation of breeding amongst feral big cats in . the UK. 'We are no closer to indicating that . with these results, but lessons have been learnt from Warwick . University's valuable input to this exercise. 'We should not be complacent about . possible big cats in the UK, but considering these animals living . secretly in our landscape can fire people's imaginations and help us . consider all of the wild nature around us. 'Our outdoors can still hold surprises.'","Experts feared a wild cat was stalking the Gloucestershire countryside .

William Hague today called for the fight against Somali-based terrorism to be stepped up after arriving in the war-torn country. As the first British foreign secretary to visit Somalia for 20 years, Mr Hague's visit is seen as a major diplomatic push to bring stability to a country he once described as 'the world's most failed state.' Wearing a combat helmet and bullet-proof vest, Mr Hague was escorted through capital Mogadishu to his meeting with Somali president . Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed in a heavily protected armoured vehicle. The Foreign Secretary then introduced Matt Baugh, Britain’s first ambassador to the country since it collapsed . into chaos and civil war in 1991, to the President Ahmed. Guarded: Foreign Secretary William Hague called for the fight against Somali-based terrorism to be stepped up on his arrival in the state's capital, Mogadishu, today . High risk: Mr Hague had to don a combat helmet and bullet-proof vest for his 10-minute journey from the city's airport to the presidential villa in a heavily armoured vehicle . He also confirmed his intention to establish a new British embassy in Mogadishu once the security situation allows. 'For the security of the UK, it matters a lot for Somalia to become a more stable place,' Mr Hague said. Recent gains by the . 10,000-strong African Union force in the country (Amisom) had driven . back the radical Islamist group al Shabaab from the capital, he said. But with much of the south of the . country still controlled by the organisation, which has links to al . Qaeda, Mr Hague added there must be 'no let-up in the pressure.' Greetings: Mr Hague introduces newly appointed British ambassador, Matt Baugh, right, to Somalia president Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, second left. Mr Baugh is Britain's first ambassador to the country in 21 years . Getting serious: The foreign secretary said there should be 'no let-up in the pressure' on radical Islamist group al Shabaab, which still controls much of the south of the country . 'We need to step this up,' he said. 'We are not complacent about it.' Britain is hosting a major conference . on Somalia in London later this month, attended by representatives of . 50 nations in international organisations. Mr Hague has promised that . counter-terrorism will be high on the agenda as well as tackling piracy . and Somalia’s deep humanitarian problems. 'One of the objectives of our . conference in London is to strengthen counter-terrorism co-operation to . make it easier for countries in this region to disrupt terrorist . networks, to disrupt their financing and the movement of potential . terrorists.' Taking no chances: An Amisom soldier keeps a watchful eye from his tank amid increased security for Mr Hague's visit . In 2010, MI5 director-general Jonathan Evans warned that it was 'only a matter of time' before terrorists, trained in Somali camps, inspired acts of violence on the streets of the UK. However, ministers believe the success of the Amisom offensive last August in driving al Shabaab from capitol Mogadishu has opened up a window of opportunity. With suicide bombings, improvised . explosive devices and grenade attacks still a regular occurrence, new . ambassador Mr Baugh will work out of the British High Commission in . neighbouring Kenya. The . volatile security situation meant that Mr Hague’s 10-minute drive from . the Amisom base at the city’s airport to the presidential residence at .

Stripping child benefit from 1.5million families is unfair and could encourage them to work less, leading financial analysts say. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the way in which the Government was targeting high earners was ill considered. In some cases parents might even be better off apart. All families with young children are given the benefit and – for a couple with two children – it is worth £1,752 a year. But next year the Chancellor is planning to stop payouts to parents if one or both is on £42,475 or more – the threshold for the higher rate of tax. The IFS’s report slammed the ‘cliff-edge’ nature of George Osborne’s move, which triggered fury when it was announced last October. A couple who both work and each earn £42,000 will continue to receive the benefit while having a family income of £84,000. But a couple where one parent earns £43,000 and the other earns nothing because they stay at home to look after the children will lose it all. The IFS said this will ‘create a bizarre and economically damaging set of incentives’ which may make people work less. Around 170,000 parents would be better off if they asked their boss for a pay cut in order to continue receiving child benefit. The IFS says the policy will also ‘increase the so-called couple penalty’, a problem the Tories had pledged to tackle. A single parent might be put off from marrying a higher rate taxpayer due to the loss of the benefit, while a couple could split in order to keep it. Jill Kirby, a family expert and the author of The Price of Parenthood, said the child benefit change was ‘anti-family’. She added: ‘The IFS’s analysis underlines just how unfair this change will be for one-earner families. It is out of touch with family life, and just how expensive it is.’ Siobhan Freegard, co-founder of Netmums, said: ‘You could not, under any circumstances, argue that it is fair.’ One user of the parenting website . said: ‘I am absolutely outraged that I have friends who both earn in the . region of what my husband earns so they have an income of £80,000, and . they will still get the benefit. 'Anti-family': The change will be unfair for one-earner families and is out-of-touch, critics say . ‘That is so grossly unfair. I am fit to burst with anger.’ Another said her children would lose out because she will have to move from working four days a week to full time to make up for the loss of her child benefit. Dr Katherine Rake of the Family and Parenting Institute said: ‘This report is the latest warning that the Government’s child benefit reform proposals could usher in an unfair penalty for many single-earner couples.’ The Treasury insisted yesterday the policy will go ahead despite hints from the Prime Minister that there may be concessions. A spokesman said: ‘It is fair to ask those who are better off in our society to make a contribution to paying down the debts that we have built up over the last decade in Britain.’","Move could encourage claimants to work less, analysts say .

The family of a Minnesota couple missing in the Costa Concordia cruise ship disaster have said they accept the decision to end the search. In a blog posting, the children of Jerry and Barbara Heil of White Bear Lake said they are 'certainly disheartened to hear the news' but understand. Italian emergency officials decided to end the search due to the danger posed to rescue workers. Whereabouts unknown: The family of Minnesota couple Jerry and Barbara Heil, who are missing in the Costa Concordia cruise ship disaster, have said they accept the decision by Italian authorities to end the search . The Heil family said in a statement: . 'We cannot express enough our sincere gratitude to all those involved in . the search and rescue effort. Time and time again, the rescuers faced . many perils in the hopes of reuniting the missing with their families. 'We . will be forever grateful for all those who worked so hard for people . they did not even know, yet understood how important their job was for . those that remained waiting for news. 'As . we struggle to come to grips with this tragedy, we find comfort knowing . Mom and Dad are now in a better place free from any worries.' The Heils are the only Americans missing following the January 13 disaster. Some 4,200 passengers and crew were on board the Costa Concordia when it capsized. Prayers: Daughter in-law Sue Heil wipes a tear away during a prayer service held last month for Jerry and Barbara Heil at the Church of St. Pius X in White Bear Lake Minn . Supporting community: Bobbie Driscoll is seen helping light candles at the prayer service for the Heils while friends take turns preparing meals for their surviving family left in mourning . Seventeen . bodies have been recovered, of which one has not yet been identified. Sixteen people remain listed as missing but are presumed dead. The last . time anyone was found alive was January 15. The Heils are active members of the Church of St Pius X in White Bear Lake, a St Paul suburb. Church members describe the Heils as quiet, kind people deeply involved in their congregation. Devoted couple: The Heils are the only Americans missing following the January 13 disaster . Bad conditions: Rough seas and strong winds today prevented rescue, salvage and anti-pollution operations from taking place in the waters off the Italian island of Giglio, where the Costa Concordia lies capsized . Jerry Heil, 69, who retired from a job . at the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, would teach religious . education classes, and Barbara Heil, 70, would bring baked goods to . class members. Diane . Vorwald, 48, who uses a wheelchair, said Jerry Heil would come to her . home weekly to administer communion. In the summer, he would bring her . fresh pies, she recalled. Ms Vorwald said: 'He's done a lot for me. It's a loss to me.' The Heil family is now making plans for a memorial service within the coming weeks. The frightful images of the sinking Costa Concordia have scared off some cruise passengers, at least . temporarily, during the industry's peak booking season. Travel agents - who book more than . two-thirds of cruise passengers worldwide - have been nervously watching . bookings ever since the Costa Concordia, which is owned by Carnival, ran aground on January 13. On Monday, they got a new reason to be nervous - bookings fell . significantly for Miami-based Carnival following the Costa . accident. Frightening: Horrific images of the sinking Costa Concordia have scared off some cruise passengers during the industry's peak booking season . Attention is now focused on Royal Caribbean Cruises, . which reports earnings on Thursday. An increase there could show that . passengers are fleeing Carnival over safety fears. A decrease could . indicate an overall distrust of all cruise lines. Nearly 11million Americans took a cruise last year, generating an . estimated $14.5billion in revenue for the industry, according to . PhoCusWright, a travel research firm. Like the rest of the travel . industry, cruise lines are still recovering from the Great Recession. Several new mega-ships started sailing just as passengers struggling . with their finances decided to stay home. But 2012 was supposed to be a . year of moderate growth. Carnival won't say exactly how much bookings have dropped, but it . disclosed on Monday that in the 12 days following the Concordia capsizing . there was a per cent decline 'in the mid-teens compared to the prior . year'. Dwarfed: Firemen scuba divers check one of the propellers of the Costa Concordia . Reservations hit a low on January 16, the company said in its annual . report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Carnival operates 101 ships under several brands including Costa, . Carnival, Cunard, Holland America, Princess and Seabourn. It said . reservations with the Costa line are 'down significantly' but difficult . to interpret because many Costa customers were rebooked on other ships . because of the loss of the Concordia ship. 'Despite these recent trends, we believe the incident will not have a . significant long-term impact on our business,' the company said. Carnival's statement is the first evidence that passengers are hesitant . to embark on cruises after seeing the awful images of the Concordia . shipwrecked off the Italian coast.","Jerry and Barbara Heil of Minnesota are the only Americans missing following the January 13 disaster .

War of words: David Cameron last night pledged to do 'everything' he can to get India to change its mind and buy the British-built Eurofighter . David Cameron stepped up his war of words with France yesterday, rubbishing the quality of a French jet that the Indian government has chosen to buy over the British-built Eurofighter. The Prime Minister vowed to do ‘everything I can’ to persuade the Indians to change their mind and award the £13billion deal to British company BAE Systems and its three European partners. India announced on Tuesday that French company Dassault Rafale had won preferred-bidder status to build 126 fighters because its equipment was cheaper. MPs branded the decision ‘disastrous’ for Britain as government lawyers investigated whether the UK could file a legal challenge to the decision. Going on the attack, Mr Cameron rubbished the quality of the Rafale jet, telling MPs the Typhoon was a ‘superb aircraft with far better capabilities than Rafale’. And senior government sources said the Indians had chosen ‘cheap and cheerful’ over quality. ‘They’ve gone for the Asda option instead of Waitrose,’ one source said. Mr Cameron added: ‘I will do everything I can – as I have already – to encourage the Indians to look at Typhoon, because I think it is such a good aircraft.’ The Indian decision handed a propaganda victory to French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who last week taunted Mr Cameron with the sneering claim that Britain ‘has no industry’. 'Cheap and cheerful': The French-built Rafale jet which was described last night as the 'Asda option' Tory MPs are furious that India has snubbed the UK when Britain is pumping nearly £1.2billion of foreign aid into the country over the next four years. France gave just £18million in 2009. Tory David Davis, who represents workers at BAE’s Brough plant, near Hull, said: ‘That is disastrous news for thousands of workers up and down the country.’ He urged Mr Cameron to do more, ‘given the long relationship between India and Britain and given that we give many times more aid to India than France ever did’. The Government was again on the back foot yesterday after it emerged that the Ministry of Defence will no longer give British companies priority over their foreign rivals when buying weapons and equipment for the Armed Forces. Defence procurement minister Peter Luff said the only exception would be when buying British was necessary to maintain national security, as he outlined details of a new White Paper. Unions accused the Government of a ‘stunning betrayal’ of UK manufacturing for the decision to buy defence equipment ‘off the shelf’ from the cheapest supplier. Unite, which represents staff at BAE Systems plants in Samlesbury and Warton in Lancashire, called on Mr Cameron to fly to India. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said No 10 was in talks with the British High Commission in Delhi, exploring ways to reopen the bidding process. 'Superior': The British manufactured Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft which the Indians have rejected because it is more expensive . He said: ‘We are looking at this issue closely. Clearly it is not a done deal.’ He also defended the plans not to protect UK firms when bidding for contracts with the MoD on the grounds that the new plans will save money. ‘Clearly defence procurement has been a problem in the past. We had a huge black hole in the defence budget. ‘We need to ensure we get the best equipment for our Armed Forces at the best price. ‘We have a competitive defence industry in this country and it will continue to win contracts.’ The spokesman also defended the huge amount of aid sent to India. ‘India is still home to one third of the people in the world who live on less than 80p a day. We have targeted the poorest people and places where there are security implications for the UK.’","French company 'preferred-bidder' to provide India with 126 fighters .

Facebook crashed yesterday afternoon, less than 24 hours after its $5billion IPO which will make millionaires out of 1,000 of its employees. The site was inaccessible for several minutes - forcing users to take to the social network's rival to bemoan the ill-timed outage. Facebook’s explosive growth is set to value the company at a whopping $100billion in the wake of the biggest stock offering in Silicon Valley's history. Thanks: Facebook released a picture of some staff thanking users for their support ahead of its $5billion initial public offering. But some users don't think that is enough thanks and they want a cut of the money . But the social network in Menlo Park, California, is now facing . a backlash from some of its 845million users, some of whom are unhappy that so much money is being made from . the information and photos they posted for free. And they won't see a cent of it. Along with that criticism, the relatively care-free days of ‘hypergrowth’ may be behind . Facebook, as the firm begins the difficult task of living up to Wall Street's . lofty expectations under the new, public microscope, analysts say. At a valuation of $100billion, Facebook is worth $118 per . user. Last month, 57 per cent of active users interacted with the service on . any given day, up from 54 per cent at the same time last year. And despite some backlash, U.S. users seem willing to devote increasing amounts of time . to the site - seven hours each month compared to just over five hours only a . year ago, data from industry research firm comScore says. Facebook released a picture of its staff on Wednesday thanking . its users for their support ahead of its $5billion initial public offering. They also seemed to be thanking users for making them rich. Head guy: Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook, seen in San Francisco, California. The social network filed an initial public offering prospectus on Wednesday with an eye toward raising $5billion . User Phillip Pambrun doesn’t think they went far enough showing their appreciation. ‘Am I the only person that thinks every Facebook member . should receive at least one share at initial post?’ Mr Pambrun wrote. He went . on to suggest users complain to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, 27. 'If it wasn't for all of you loyal and faithful Facebookers, this would never have gotten this far. So, everyone, message the high ""Z"" for your minimum one share' Phillip Pambrun, user . ‘If it wasn't for all of you loyal and faithful Facebookers, . this would never have gotten this far,’ he wrote, reported CNN. ‘So, everyone, . message the high ""Z"" for your minimum one share.’ And there may be bigger riches to come for the company and the thousands of employees who hold equity in the company. Facebook's advertising business has room for growth. In . 2011, the number of ads delivered on the website rose 42 per cent year on year, . while the average price per ad delivered rose 18 per cent. The wealth of information that users give Facebook - from . their age, gender and city of residence to the music and products that they ‘like’ - means that the company can easily do targeted marketing. Hugely-popular: Social network Facebook is now facing a backlash from its 845million users, unhappy it's making so much money from their content, details and photos they posted for free . Jeff Pantridge joked that he was considering making a ‘Jeffbook’ website. ‘I should have something whipped up in an hour,’ the user wrote, reported CNN. ‘Friend . me, follow me... Whatever ... . It's time to get paid.’ But the $3.7billion in revenue last year was at the low end . of expectations and showed the wide gulf between its current business and the . most optimistic hopes that many investors have. '$5 billion IPO for Facebook?!?!? What the hell am I doing on Facebook??? Screw this... I'm making Jeffbook. I should have something whipped up in an hour. Friend me, follow me... Whatever ... . It's time to get paid' Jeff Pantridge, user . ‘For the valuation that people are going to be paying for . this name, they're going to probably be overpaying by a third because of the . optimism related to just the name,’ Michael Yoshikami said. Mr Yoshikami, the chief executive of California-based wealth . management firm YCMNET Advisors, added: ‘The numbers justify maybe a $50billion (valuation) number.’ Facebook's revenue growth rate - roughly 88 per cent in 2011 . - would justify a $65billion valuation, which is far short of the $100billion . that sources have said the company is looking for, he said. No doubt some disgruntled users would take their share of that lower valuation figure. Big job: The relatively care-free days of 'hypergrowth' may be behind Facebook, as the firm begins the difficult task of living up to Wall Street's lofty expectations under a public microscope, analysts say . Meanwhile, membership growth is slowing. In the last three . months of 2011, Facebook's total monthly active users rose 5.6 per cent versus . 10.5 per cent in the last three months of 2010. ‘The hypergrowth is probably over,’ economic analyst Michael .

"By . James Chapman . Last updated at 8:25 AM on 1st February 2012 . Pledge: Andrew Lansley, pictured outside No 10 yesterday, will today pledge to give 1m extra people access to an NHS dentist . NHS dentists are to treat an extra million patients following a shake-up in funding. Health Secretary Andrew Lansley will today pledge that everyone who lost their NHS dentist since 2006 will now have access to one. The Coalition has set aside £28million, trimmed from the NHS budget via efficiency savings, to pay for the new patients. The funding will be given to primary care trusts, who have bid for the cash by setting out proposals to expand local services. They will fund new dentists, increase the number of appointments with existing ones, or provide care in people’s homes for patients who cannot travel to a surgery. Between 2006 and 2008, a million Britons lost access to an NHS dentist. The collapse in coverage followed a disastrous reform of dentists’ contracts by the Labour government. It also led to a sharp increase in emergency hospital admissions from people carrying out DIY tooth extractions. Mr Lansley told the Daily Mail: ‘Labour politicians let down families across the country who were no longer able to see an NHS dentist because of their failed policies. Cutbacks: 1million people lost access to an NHS dentist between 2006 and 2008 after a disastrous reform of contracts by the Labour Government . ‘Giving those people back their NHS dentist is a key priority of mine so I am delighted that we have been able to find more money for dentistry because of our successful programme of efficiency savings in the NHS. ‘This is a great example of how the money we are saving by working more efficiently, cutting bureaucracy and rooting out waste in the NHS is being reinvested in frontline services for patients.’ The Coalition launched trials of a new dental contract, particularly focused on improving children’s oral health, last year. Dentists will be paid for the number of patients they care for and the health results, rather than the number of courses of treatment performed.","Coalition set aside £28million to expand services .

"By . Andy Dolan . Last updated at 8:50 AM on 2nd February 2012 . For 642 days, the residents have camped out to prevent the spread of an illegal traveller camp on the edge of their village. But now the vigilant villagers of Meriden are being thrown off their protest camp – while the travellers remain. Planning officials ruled that the residents’ rudimentary shelter of caravan, tarpaulin and wood-burning stove constituted an illegal development and must be dismantled. Fighting spirit: The villagers' protest camp in the village of Meriden, West Midlands. Now the group face eviction themselves after being told their camp is illegal . But the town hall has so far failed to move on the travellers, despite the rejection of their planning application. The decision was last night condemned by the residents of the West Midlands village, who branded the move by Solihull Council’s planning committee a ‘disgrace’. They warned the illegal traveller site was in danger of becoming Dale Farm II – a reference to the mass illegal occupation in Cray’s Hill, Essex, which only ended after a multi-million pound, decade-long planning row. Invasion: The illegal travellers' encampment. The site has been turned into a quagmire . The Meriden travellers paid £100,000 to buy a paddock from a local businessman and, in time-honoured fashion, moved on to the land at the start of a bank holiday weekend in April last year – when the council was powerless to stop them developing the site. But they had not reckoned on the determination of villagers to preserve the Meriden Gap greenbelt which separates the village from Coventry and Solihull. As word spread, residents swung into action, descending on the eight-acre site and forming a human barricade to prevent a convoy of lorries from delivering 1,800 tons of hardcore rubble to the site later that evening. Ever since, around 200 residents have manned their camp around the clock to make sure the site is not developed any further, working to a rota with shifts lasting anything from an hour to overnight. Only last week they succeeded in preventing another eight lorry loads of hardcore from being deposited at the site. But like their foes, the residents did not have planning permission for the camp – which stands on a builders’ yard driveway immediately opposite the gypsy settlement – and, last night, the Tory-run authority voted to issue an enforcement against it. Planners ordered them to remove the stove, caravan and tarpaulin by March 31, even though the owner of the builders’ yard has given them full permission to remain there. Around 80 villagers and members of the residents’ group Meriden RAID (Residents Against Inappropriate Development) packed into a meeting last night at the council house to hear the decision. Protest: Villagers attend a council meeting where councillors on the Tory-run Solihull Council ruled that the protesters encampament was illegal . And despite the eviction order, they remained upbeat, chanting ‘we shall not be moved’ outside the building. They vowed to continued their protest and face the elements with no shelter or warmth. RAID spokesman Dave McGrath said: ‘We are bitterly disappointed that councils have voted to evict residents. ‘We are the people who have prevented hundreds of tonnes of hardcore being dropped on our otherwise unspoilt countryside. We are the people who have alerted the council to subsequent breaches of the injunction they imposed on the gypsies. Christmas blockade: Residents man their encampment at the site taken over by gypsies on December 25 . Moving in: Travellers build their camp on the site in Meriden, West Midlands, as they set-up in May 2010 - despite a blockade being set up . ‘They have admitted we have a valuable role to play in monitoring the site but then decide to kick us off. It’s a disgrace that the planning system finds it easy to enforce against law-abiding tax-payers but seems to become paralysed when it comes to taking action against travellers and gypsies.’ Mr McGrath, a training consultant who lives yards from both camps, said the group would comply with the order but will ‘sit in the rain if necessary to maintain our vigil’ and urged the council to ‘speed up’ enforcement action against the travellers. He said the group had the right to appeal the council’s decision, but would not on cost grounds. Traveller takeover: The group invade the greenbelt site in April 2010 - while the council are powerless to act . The gypsies lodged a retrospective planning application after moving on to the site, which was turned down by the local authority. In October, Eric Pickles, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, upheld a planning inspector’s recommendation that the appeal should be dismissed. The gypsies will remain on the site until at least next month, the earliest date the council could obtain a High Court hearing to apply for an injunction to remove them from site. Meriden RAID also lost an appeal against the council’s decision to refuse them retrospective planning permission for their own camp, triggering last night’s enforcement action. Last night, around ten caravans remained on the gypsy site. The once-lush paddock has now been turned into a muddy quagmire caused by the gypsies' 4X4 vehicles repeatedly entering and leaving the site.","Residents warn illegal site is in danger of becoming Dale Farm II .

David Cameron, clearly a fan of Harry Potter, has once more referred to Liam Byrne as 'Baldemort'. The Prime Minister first used the term during his budget response two years ago - and today, the Labour shadow Work and Pensions Secretary was reminded of the abrasive moniker. As Tory MPs focused on the subject of the benefit cap, Mr Cameron mocked the Labour front bench for not stating its position on the issue. The PM said: 'Just nod - are you with us or against us?' As the camera panned across the faces of the Opposition, Mr Cameron added: 'A great big vacuum.' And although Mr Bryne was present at the House of Commons, the Tory leader didn't seem to notice him, saying: 'Where is Baldemort? He's not at home today.' Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister first used the term during his budget response two years ago - and today, the Labour shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, Liam Byrne (left), was reminded of the abrasive moniker . David Cameron speaks during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons today . When Mr Byrne vacated his position as Chief Secretary to the Treasury in May 2010, he famously left a note for new incumbent, David Laws, which read: 'Dear Chief Secretary, I'm afraid to tell you there is no money. Kind regards and good luck!' And although Mr Cameron managed to get away with his latest swipe at Mr Byrne without any chastisement, he did get a ticking off for calling Labour leader Ed Miliband a hypocrite . Mr . Miliband said legislation requiring banks to disclose how many employees were . paid more than £1million was already on the statute book and could be . implemented by ministers. But Mr . Cameron told him: 'We now have the toughest and most transparent regime of . any major financial centre in the world. 'For . the first time ever, banks are going to publish the pay of the top eight . executives. That never happened in 13 years of a Labour government.' But he . said Sir David Walker, who had proposed the reforms on publishing the number of . £1million salaries, had recommended it should be done across the European . Union. Mr . Miliband said the Prime Minister was giving 'no leadership on top . pay' and added that 'there are more than eight people earning over £1million at our banks'. He said . Chancellor George Osborne had backed the reforms before he took office and it . was 'another broken promise'. Mr Cameron . shot back: 'It was the last Labour government, when you were in the . Cabinet, that agreed an RBS bonus pool of £1.3billion, literally hundreds of . people were getting million-pound bonuses and you signed it off. 'The . issue for you is why are you in favour now in Opposition of things you never . did in Government? 'Some . might call it Opposition, some people might call it hypocrisy.' Mr Cameron . was forced to withdraw the comment after Commons Speaker John Bercow ruled: 'The use of the word hypocrisy in relation to an individual Member is not . parliamentary.' The Prime . Minister said he was 'very happy' to withdraw the comment, adding: 'I think it's just because we are expected to listen to the people who . presided over the biggest banking and financial disaster in our history.' Mr . Miliband told Mr Cameron that hypocrisy was 'saying you are going to stop . a £1million bonus to Stephen Hester and then nodding it through'. Mr Hester . bowed to mounting public pressure and waived his near-£1million share bonus . after a public row over the payment. The Labour . leader told Mr Cameron: 'I think we have now heard it all, because you . said that the class war is going to be led by you and your Cabinet of . millionaires. 'I . don't think it's going to wash, frankly.' Turning to . the issue of putting workers on pay committees, Mr Miliband said it would 'bring a does of realism' to salary awards. It would . mean 'people on a huge salary at least have to look one of their employees . in the eye and justify it'. Mr Cameron . said: 'I don't think it is practical to do what is suggested. It breaks an . important principle of not having people on a remuneration committee who have . their own pay determined. 'So I . don't think it's the right way forward.' The Prime . Minister claimed that Mr Miliband wanted to ban performance-related pay in all . but exceptional circumstances, which would be 'completely wrong' and 'shows he hasn't got a clue how to run an economy'. Mr . Miliband said: 'Now we know where the Prime Minister stands: no to . transparency, no to an employee on the remuneration committee. 'What . was the Chancellor doing last week when they were supposed to be cracking down . on top pay? He was going to Davos to tell the business community to lobby for a . reduction in the top rate of income tax. 'We . know the truth: when it comes to top pay, this Government and this Prime . Minister are part of the problem, not part of the solution.' Mr . Cameron, after the rebuke by the Speaker over the use of the word 'hypocrisy', said: 'I don't know what the word is for . criticising someone who went to Davos, when you went to Davos yourself...' He added: 'I think the word Peter Mandelson used (about Mr Miliband) when he was in . Davos was ""struggling"".' Mr Bercow . quipped: 'The Prime Minister is exceptionally well-educated and I'm sure . he has got a very full vocabulary and can make proper use of it.'",PM gets away with comment - but is chastised by Speaker for calling Ed Miliband a hypocrite .

As a waiting ambulance drove off, a police officer shone a torch into Mr Holt's face by chance as the firefighters were reeling in hoses. However, it was too late to save him and although he was rushed to hospital he was pronounced dead. Mr Holt, a joiner, had returned home from a family Christening in the early hours of the morning on July 13, 2010, when the fire broke out. Firefighter Rick Gregson went into the back of the house with his number two, Matthew Birch. Both were wearing breathing gear.

Find: PC Jill Jackson discovered Mr Holt by chance as her torch swept across the dark lounge . While Mr Gregson looked round the upstairs, Mr Birch searched the kitchen. He said he did not think it was necessary to search the lounge as he saw three firefighters wearing breathing apparatus in there. Another firefighter, Russell Maden, also went into the front of the property with his number two Richard Newton. But between the four of them, none of them spotted Mr Holt lying by the sofa. PC Jill Jackson told the inquest in Bolton said it was only when she walked into the dark property for a second time that she stumbled across Mr Holt in the lounge. 'I just walked in the front room to find a telephone point, where a name and address book or contact book with names of family members might be,' she said. 'It was a little bit clearer in the house but it wasn't quite dawn out yet, I was using my torch. 'I shone my torch in the corner furthest from the front door where there might be a phone point. 'When I turned it, it shone directly in Mr Holt's face. He was against the far wall. His legs were covered from my view by the sofa. 'I could see the top of his body, he was against the wall as if he was sat on the floor.' Danny's mother Linda told the hearing that if a proper search had been carried out he would have found.

The planets orbit close to their host stars and range in size from 1.5 times the radius of Earth to larger than Jupiter. Fifteen are between Earth and Neptune in size. Further observations will be required to determine which are rocky like Earth and which have thick gaseous atmospheres like Neptune. All the new planets are closer to their host star than Venus is to our Sun. Kepler-33, a star that is older and more . massive than our Sun, had the most planets. The system hosts five . planets, ranging in size from 1.5 to 5 times that of Earth. 'Prior to the Kepler mission, we knew of perhaps 500 exoplanets across the whole sky,' said Doug Hudgins, Kepler program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Kepler identifies planet candidates by repeatedly measuring the change in brightness of stars to detect when a planet passes in front of the star. That passage casts a small shadow toward Earth and the Kepler spacecraft. The planets were detected by monitoring changes in brightness as they orbit in front of their stars. Scientists will now try to establish whether they are rocky, like earth, or gaseous, like Neptune . Each of the new confirmed planetary systems contains two to five closely spaced transiting planets. In tightly packed planetary systems, the gravitational pull of the planets on each other causes some planets to accelerate and some to decelerate along their orbits. Kepler detects this effect by measuring the changes, or so-called Transit Timing Variations (TTVs).Planetary systems with TTVs can be verified without requiring extensive ground-based observations, accelerating confirmation of planet candidates. The TTV detection technique also increases Kepler’s ability to confirm planetary systems around fainter and more distant stars.Five of the systems (Kepler-25, Kepler-27, Kepler-30, Kepler-31 and Kepler-33) contain a pair of planets where the inner planet orbits the star twice during each orbit of the outer planet. Four of the systems (Kepler-23, Kepler-24, Kepler-28 and Kepler-32) contain a pairing where the outer planet circles the star twice for every three times the inner planet orbits its star. The properties of a star provide clues for planet detection. The decrease in the star’s brightness and duration of a planet transit, combined with the properties of its host star, present a recognizable signature. When astronomers detect planet candidates that exhibit similar signatures around the same star, the likelihood of any of these planet candidates being a false positive is very low.'The approach used to verify the Kepler-33 planets shows the overall reliability is quite high,' said Jack Lissauer, planetary scientist at NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif., and lead author of the paper on Kepler-33. These discoveries are published in four different papers in the Astrophysical Journal and the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.","One solar system with sun older than ours has five planets .

More than half (52 per cent) are over-friendly in the workplace, throwing colleagues suggestive glances or smiles. While others choose to send flowers, such as lilies, roses and carnations as a way of revealing their affection. A study claims that married Geordies in their thirties are the nation's biggest flirts . The UK study on relationship trends also named Katie Price and Nigella Lawson as the top celebrity flirts. While TOWIE star Mark Wright and Simon Cowell - . infamous for his suggestive wink - also topped the charts. And away from the limelight accountants, teachers and politicians were found to be the most flirtatious professions . Other unusual but cost-effective locations Brits sought romance included funerals and hospitals. But taking a back seat were bars and clubs as Brits preferred to get amorous in the office. However a quarter of the 1,000 adults surveyed (25 per cent) claimed never to flirt. The findings have been unveiled to mark the UK 's first ever National Flirt Day on February 2nd. According to the Flower Council of . Holland, which commissioned the research, this is the day when adults are most likely to make romantic overtures.

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . Last updated at 5:38 PM on 30th January 2012 . A teenager who was planning her own funeral is enjoying a new lease of life thanks to a life-saving double lung transplant. Casey Blunstone,16, was told by doctors that she had just days to live as cystic fibrosis had caused her lung function to drop to dangerous levels. For the past ten years she had been confined to hospital as a result of her debilitating condition and operated on twenty times. Casey Blunstone was given just days to live but is now looking forward to a bright future following a life-saving double lung transplant . She was top of the transplant list for her height, age group and blood type but no suitable donor could be found and her family launched an appeal. And with days left news came that a match had been located and Casey, from Walgherton, Cheshire East, underwent a ten-hour transplant procedure at Great Ormond Street Hospital, in London. She . is now looking forward to a bright future and medics expect a full recovery. Her mother Gaynor, 48, said that the family were overjoyed when a match was discovered. She said: 'We were really desperate at this stage. 'It was a nerve-wracking wait to find out whether we had a match because the live donor was no longer an option. 'But we were told the lungs were in pristine condition.' Road to recovery: For the past ten years Casey had been confined to hospital . Casey was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when she was four-weeks-old. The disease affects the internal organs, especially the lungs and digestive system, causing them to become clogged with thick, sticky mucus. She previously had to spend 20 . hours-a-day hooked up to a ventilation machine at Crewe’s Leighton . Hospital. But it was when her lung function fell to a dangerous 16 per cent that she was admitted to Great Ormond Street Hospital and medics located a suitable donor. She said: 'When I found out that my transplant could go ahead I was just overwhelmed. 'I have been waiting so long for a donor that I was in shock at first because I didn’t think it was going to happen.' The teenager is now appealing for others to join the donor register so that more lives can be saved. She added: 'The first thing I thought after my operation was that I want people to keep donating their organs. 'I have been really poorly, but I was given another chance at life and that is all I want for those who are still suffering.' Over four days she managed to recruit more than 300 people to . join the Organ Donation Register and is now set to become an . advocate of Live Life Then Give Life - a national donor charity. Her brother Tom, 25, described how he had been inspired by her efforts. He said: 'She has been ill all of her life and it has been hard work for . her. But she just keeps going and has always stayed positive.' She is now hoping to join her friends at school full-time after years of missing classes. Cystic fibrosis is a common inherited disease causing recurrent chest infections, poor growth and related health problems, such as diabetes and infertility. It affects over 8,500 children and young adults in the UK, where five babies are born with the condition every week.","Teenager underwent 20 operations during her 10-year hospital stay .

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . Last updated at 4:16 PM on 30th January 2012 . A grandmother was able to diagnose a toddler's one-in-a-million illness - which had left doctors baffled for years - after spotting the symptoms on television. Carol Hayton, 44, was watching a BBC Three documentary series Underage and Pregnant when she saw a child demonstrating the same symptoms as her two-year-old grandson Declan. The youngster was suffering from Moebius Syndrome, an extremely rare congenital neurological disorder characterised by facial paralysis and the inability to move the eyes from side to side. Relief: Michelle Purcell and Anthony Hayton pictured with their son Declan . She quickly visited Declan's parents, who live next door, and told them about her discovery. As a result,Michelle Purcell and Anthony Hayton, both . 23, from Barrow, Cumbria, secured an appointment with a geneticist - a biologist who studies genetics, - at a . hospital in Lancaster last November, who confirmed the prognosis. Carol said: 'There had been a . trailer for the programme and I said to my husband that the little boy looked like Declan. 'We sat down to watch it and he looked the absolute spit. All children with Moebius Syndrome look the same. 'Michelle and Anthony had been to I . don’t know how many appointments. I know it’s rare but the doctors . should know something about it.' Two-year-old Declan has been diagnosed with Moebius syndrome . Declan was admitted to Furness . General Hospital’s special care baby unit shortly after he was born and . has been plagued with medical issues ever since. He suffers from epilepsy, . club foot, muscle-restricting condition hypertonia and facial paralysis, and spent months visiting specialists at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital. His parents Michelle Purcell and . Anthony Hayton, both 23, travelled back and forth to . appointments while doctors struggled to get to the bottom of his . problems. Carol Hayton (pictured) spotted Declan's symptoms on television . They also had to balance his round-the-clock care while . looking after their three other children, Roxy, four, Logan, two and . seven-month-old Riley. Mr Hayton said: 'For the last two years we have been so worried, not . knowing what’s wrong with him, what equipment he needs, whether he will . ever walk. 'His condition is so rare no one wants to . touch us. 'I’ve been to social services, the hospital, patient liason . services, everywhere asking them for some help. 'Everything we know about . his condition we have taught ourselves through the internet and our . research.' There are just 124 known cases of Moebius Syndrome in the UK and most people with the condition are born with complete facial paralysis and cannot close their eyes or form facial expressions. Some symptoms can be treated with the right therapy and surgery. Declan requires a special feeding tube to maintain sufficient nutrition and it is unclear how the condition will develop. Miss Purcell said: 'As a mother, you’re . constantly worrying whether you’re doing the right thing. We just want . someone to tell us how best to care for him.' The family are now appealing for support and at-home equipment from from community health workers. A spokesperson for Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Barrow’s community health services, said: 'Getting it right for this patient is our priority and we are working with the family to ensure appropriate community care is provided.' The condition is named after Paul Julius Möbius, a German neurologist who first described the syndrome in 1888.","Doctors baffled by Declan Hayton's symptoms .

Luan Moreton, Kim Jones and Jemma Dennis lost their mother to breast cancer when she was only 32, and tests revealed that they had inherited the same faulty gene. They decided to have preventive double mastectomies as an alternative to a lifetime of monitoring.The two elder sisters have also had  hysterectomies after doctors told them the faulty BRCA1 gene gave them a 50-60 per cent chance of developing ovarian cancer. (Left to right) Luan Moreton, Kim Jones and Jemma Dennis from Nuneaton: All have had double mastectomies . The youngest, 30-year-old Jemma, plans . to have the operation too, but not until she has tried for children with . husband Mark, 37, an architect. Yesterday the trio urged other women to be screened for the gene and consider pre-emptive surgery before cancer strikes. Mrs Moreton, 38, said: ‘We were all very close growing up after what . happened to Mum, but these operations have made us even closer. ‘I feel that we are lucky because we realised we all had the gene and took steps to prevent it from developing. ‘People need to know that there are things you can do to minimise the . risk. Mum must have had the gene but she was never tested for it. ‘It was too late for her – but we were able to do something about it.’ Family tragedy: Mother Rita with her daughter Luan in 1982 - Rita died from breast cancer four years later in 1986 . She was 12, her sister Kim seven and Jemma just four when their mother Rita died in 1986. In 2005 Mrs Moreton from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, discovered a lump in . her breast two weeks before she married husband Sean, a printer. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that belong to a class known as tumour suppressors.In normal cells, BRCA1 and BRCA2 help ensure the stability of the cell’s DNA and help prevent uncontrolled cell growth. However, women who inherit a mutated form of these genes are at far greater risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer at a young age. Harmful BRCA1 mutations may also increase a woman’s risk of developing cervical, uterine, pancreatic, and colon cancer. Harmful BRCA2 mutations may also increase the risk of pancreatic cancer, stomach cancer, gallbladder and bile duct cancer, and melanoma. Men who carry the BRCA1 gene have a greater risk of breast cancer and possibly pancreatic and prostate cancer. However, this is more likely among men with the BRCA2 gene. Source: National Cancer Institute, U.S . Tests showed she had breast cancer and later that month doctors carried . out a lumpectomy, which was followed by a six-month course of . chemotherapy and four weeks of radiotherapy. The treatment was successful, but further examinations carried out when . she was pregnant with her son Nate, now four, revealed she was carrying . the faulty BRCA1 gene which gives an 85 per cent chance of developing . breast cancer. Her sisters took blood tests which showed that they, too, had the faulty gene. Mrs Moreton said: ‘It was daunting but we agreed that we would all . rather have the operation than not be around in a few years’ time.’ Mrs Dennis was first to have the surgery in 2007. She said: ‘For me it wasn’t even a decision. ‘It wasn’t a case of “if” I got cancer, it was a case of “when”. I didn’t want to sit and wait for it to happen. ‘I knew I wanted to have a double mastectomy, and I wanted it done quickly so I couldn’t dwell on it.’ Mrs Moreton was next in 2008 and Miss Jones, 33, followed in 2009. All recovered well, but were then told it was highly likely the faulty BRCA1 gene could go on to cause ovarian cancer. They made the heart-wrenching decision to have hysterectomies, meaning they could no longer have children. Mrs Moreton and Miss Jones, a mother of two who is engaged to graphic . designer Marc Sharman, 34, have already had their operations. Kim, Jemma and Luan as children: All three have urged women with a family history of breast cancer to get checked for the aggressive BRCA1 gene . Mrs Dennis said: ‘I will definitely have it done, but I do not know when it will be.’ The IT worker added: ‘It does play on your mind quite a bit but I try . not to think about it too much. I want to have children first – they are . the priority for me now.’ A spokesman for Cancer Research UK said: ‘The BRCA1 gene is one gene . that can contribute to a breast cell becoming cancerous if it is . mutated. ‘When a mutated BRCA1 gene is passed from parent to child, all the . breasts’ cells carry this mutation. They have a head start in the . process of collecting enough genetic mutations to enable them to become . cancerous.’ Around 100,000 British women are believed to carry dangerous versions of the BRCA1 and related BRCA2 genes. They can currently decide between a lifetime of regular monitoring or pre-emptive mastectomies.","Youngest sister, 30, will have womb removed like her siblings after she has tried for children .

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . Last updated at 5:00 PM on 30th January 2012 . He stepped out of prison this morning into the arms of his wife looking decidedly pale compared with her glowing wag-like looks. So it would be no surprise if disgraced former MSP Tommy Sheridan dropped into the tanning salon to celebrate his early release after serving just over one year of his three-year sentence for lying under oath. The 47-year-old walked out of Castle Huntly prison near Dundee shortly after 10am with his wife, Gail, vowing to appeal his conviction. Scroll down for video . Tommy and Gail Sheridan arrived back at their home in Glasgow this afternoon after the journey from Dundee where served a year of his sentence at Castle Huntly Prison . The Sheridans kiss on the doorstep of their Glasgow home where he will remain under curfew . The politician and former Celebrity . Big Brother contestant was jailed on January 26 last year for committing . perjury during his successful defamation action against the News of the . World in 2006. He was awarded £200,000 in damages . after winning the civil case but a jury at the High Court in Glasgow . found him guilty of lying about the now-defunct tabloid's claims that he . was an adulterer who visited a swingers' club. During his trial it was alleged that . he had sex with Katrine Trolle, a Scottish Socialist Party member, in . his marital bed. It was also claimed that she was involved in a . threesome with Sheridan and his brother-in-law. Miss Trolle said she had a fling with the former MSP for several years, but he denies ever having slept with her. Trial judge Lord Bracadale . subsequently handed the former leader of the Scottish Socialist Party a . three-year jail sentence, telling him his decision to pursue the Sunday . tabloid for defamation 'brought the walls of the temple crashing down' on him. Speaking outside his Glasgow home, . Sheridan said he intends to launch a fresh appeal against his . conviction, and fight for an independent Scotland. He also claimed the prospect of a 'gagging order' against him was lifted earlier today. Together, the Sheridans and their lawyer, Aamer Anwar, told reporters they would try and get his conviction overturned . Sheridan said: 'It is a relief to be . able to speak personally for once. It seems a long time now since I have . been able to speak. 'It's been an absolute delight to be . back home with my beautiful wife who I love dearly, and my daughter . Gabrielle who I have missed beyond words are able to describe. 'Up until a couple of hours ago, I . didn't know I was going to be able to speak. Up until a couple of hours . ago I was still gagged. 'I was told two hours ago that that . gag has now been lifted. Unfortunately, although I am not to be gagged . today, I will be tagged.' He . added: 'I want to thank the thousands of ordinary folk across Scotland . and further afield who have taken time to write to me, send me cards and . letters, contact me on Facebook and to show their solidarity with me . and my family throughout this difficult 12 months. 'I . would like to thank them for being so human and so warm and respecting . the fact that although we lost a trial in December of last year, we will . continue to fight to clear my name. Tommy Sheridan with his wife, Gail, as he left Castly Huntly Prison today after serving just a third of his sentence for lying under oath . Katrine Trolle alleged that she had sex with Sheridan and his brother-in-law . 'And we are determined to highlight the contrasts in treatment between the 20-plus - I've lost count of the number of - News of the World former journalists who have been arrested. 'I have not read of any of them who have had their homes raided over a mammoth nine-hour search, or their children traumatised in the interests of justice. 'Apparently they handed themselves in at the stations. Well, I've got news for them and for others: this fight is far from over. This story has not yet finished. I believe that I will return to Glasgow High Court in the near future.' Sheridan claimed 'witnesses' had lied during his perjury trial and said he would have 'a strong appeal that will hopefully lead to the quashing of my unfair, unsafe and unsound conviction'. He added: 'I have to also say, however, that in the 12 months I have been away, things have not got any better for ordinary working-class folk. Wages have been cut, prices have increased and the Con-Dem millionaire Government wants to make ordinary folk pay for a crisis that was nothing to do with them. 'I look forward to re-engaging in the battle for justice and against inequality and poverty, and I also look forward to engaging in the campaign to deliver Scotland not just as an independent country but as an independent socialist country as well. 'I thank once again all of those who have stuck by me, my family and my friends. But most of all, I thank my wife Gail.' His lawyer, Aamer Anwar, said the new appeal is related to the outcome of the police investigation into alleged perjury during Sheridan's trial. Mr Anwar said: 'Tommy is delighted to be back at home with his family. He intends to make up for lost time as best he can. Sheridan and his wife were driven away from the prison after he was released . 'I have been instructed to prepare a . new appeal which will be related to the outcome of Strathclyde Police's . investigation into allegations of phone hacking and perjury at Tommy's . trial. 'Tommy was told . before Christmas by the Scottish Prison Service that on release he could . not speak directly to the media. Such a condition would have been a . draconian attack on his right to free speech. 'Over the weekend we stated this would . be illegal and challenged it in the courts. The authorities have come . to their senses and a gagging order will not be imposed.' Sheridan will be tagged later today and under the terms of his release will have to stay at home between 7.15pm and 7.15am. Before they returned to a party inside the house, Mr and Mrs Sheridan shared an emotional kiss on their doorstep. Sheridan's . trial was one of the longest of its kind in Scottish legal history. He . was convicted of five out of six allegations in a single charge of . perjury, relating to his evidence during the civil action at the Court . of Session in Edinburgh. During . the three-month High Court trial, Sheridan claimed he was the victim of . a 'vendetta' by the police and a 'conspiracy' involving the Sunday . newspaper and former colleagues within the SSP. In August last year he was denied the chance to appeal against his conviction, following a ruling by senior judges. Castle Huntly Prison where Sheridan served just over 12 months . Sheridan - who previously served time as part of an anti-poll tax campaign and then over an anti-Trident protest at Faslane nuclear submarine base - maintained his innocence through the trial. He claimed he was the victim of a 'vendetta' by the police and a 'conspiracy' involving the News of the World and colleagues within the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP).

Sheridan, who conducted his own defence, called Andy Coulson to give evidence during the sensational trial. But the jury found him guilty of . perjury during the 2006 civil defamation case and lying about having an . affair with SSP member Katrine Trolle. In a 50-minute plea before sentencing, . Sheridan asked for a 'proportionate and reasonable' sentence and . referring to previous perjury cases, including those of former . Conservative MPs Jeffrey Archer and Jonathan Aiken, said: 'This is not a . murder trial. Nobody has been killed and neither has an innocent person . been imprisoned.' But the judge, Lord Bracadale, while . praising him as a 'hard-working' politician, added:' When perjury is . established it must be dealt with seriously for the benefit of the court . and the public. 'You embarked on an action in the . Court of Session knowing that, for it to be successful, you would be . required to tell lies under affirmation. 'You committed perjury and you were awarded a very large sum in damages. The only appropriate sentence is one of imprisonment.' Any prisoner serving a sentence of . less than four years is currently eligible for automatic early release . at the halfway point in their jail term. Sheridan would therefore be entitled to be freed from prison after 18 months. Defiant: Gail Sheridan, pictured hear after her husband was found guilty, continued to be vocal saying he would return stronger and ready to fight . However, under current provisions, it is possible for individuals to spend up to the last six months of their sentence on home detention curfew. This means they can be freed from prison to live at home but must wear an electronically monitored tag for the remainder of their sentence. At the weekend Sheridan's lawyer, Aamer Anwar, said he had been told that prison authorities would try to 'gag' him on his release. Mr Anwar promised to seek a judicial review if a public-speaking ban features in Sheridan's release conditions. Speaking on Saturday, Mr Anwar said: 'I was aware that this was being imposed. It's unprecedented, absolutely draconian and denies my client the right to earn a living.'

"By . Matt Lawton . Last updated at 1:00 AM on 4th February 2012 . John Terry was stripped of the England captaincy for the second time yesterday and a number of team-mates believe he should not be picked by Fabio Capello while allegations of racism persist. The decision, taken by the 14 members of the FA board, was  communicated first to Capello on Thursday night and then to Terry at 10am yesterday in a call from FA chairman David Bernstein. The news was broken by Mail Online. Terry faces trial on July 9, having been accused of a racially aggravated public-order offence against Anton Ferdinand. Terry denies the charge, but the FA have decided it would be inappropriate to let the 31-year-old Chelsea defender lead England at this summer’s European Championship. Given the boot: John Terry has been stripped of the England captaincy - for the second time - because he faces criminal charges over allegations he racially abused QPR defender Anton Ferdinand . On a dramatic day… . Losing the England armband has left the defender considering retirement from international football, and Sportsmail understands Terry was made aware a number of his black England team-mates had an issue with him — over his clash with Anton Ferdinand at Loftus Road on October 23 — during their last get-together. Yesterday, former Fulham striker Leroy Rosenior became the latest black football figure to speak out against Terry — joining Jason Roberts and Emmanuel Frimpong. TV pundit Rosenior told the BBC: ‘They have made the right decision. I just found it incredible that John could think he could lead England into the European Championship. I don’t even think he should go to Euro 2012 — I don’t think it would be good for the team.’ Family man: Father-of-two Terry with his wife Toni . Terry, stripped of the captaincy two years ago amid the controversy of his affair with Vanessa Perroncel and Sportsmail’s revelation that the Wembley box he was given at a discounted rate was being offered on the black market, is said to feel betrayed by the FA. But he may also feel it is difficult to face hostility in the dressing room when he is no longer skipper. The decision to delay his trial  until July 9 makes it additionally complicated for him. The FA made the unprecedented move of cancelling the pre-match handshake at last Saturday’s FA Cup tie between QPR and Chelsea because Ferdinand and his team-mates were planning to snub Terry and it is believed Manchester United players, with Rio Ferdinand among them, were planning to do the same at Stamford Bridge tomorrow before Terry was withdrawn through injury. The issue is a nightmare for Capello. He reinstated Terry as captain a year ago, ignoring warnings that the move could come back to bite him. Now he has lost his captain in chaotic circumstances for the second successive tournament, and is left with problems when it comes to appointing a replacement. After the way Capello handled replacing Rio Ferdinand with Terry last year, it is no surprise that the United defender does not want the job. He tweeted yesterday: ‘I don’t want to be England captain after the last episode, just want to concentrate on playin for utd & if I make the squad then as ever I’ll be delighted.’ Liverpool’s Steven Gerrard is the right man if he is fit and in form. He captained England at the 2010 World Cup and handled his media responsibilities extremely well. But concerns over Gerrard’s fitness do not make him the automatic choice, even if Capello (right) would prefer to go with one of the senior players. Barry is a major candidate, with the likelihood Jack Wilshere will miss the tournament through injury making the Manchester City man’s place in the side more secure. Beyond that, Capello may well consider Tottenham’s Parker; an experienced club captain and someone now among the first  players on the England team sheet despite missing out on World Cup selection. Frank Lampard could also be a contender if he can prove himself worthy of a place in England’s first XI. Wayne Rooney would have been considered had he not been suspended for the first two games in Poland and Ukraine. Ashley Cole would be a reluctant skipper and Joe Hart, while a certainty to start every game, is likely to be dismissed on the grounds he is too young. Capello, while accepting the FA’s right to strip Terry of the captaincy, is far from happy. The decision has been taken while he is in Italy and his stance on Terry has not changed. The manager made a recent visit to Chelsea’s training ground just to see Terry. But Bernstein and the FA board have made the correct call. They have to consider the public image of the England team. It is believed they stopped short of suspending Terry from international football altogether because it would set  a dangerous precedent ahead of  Terry’s case at Westminster Magistrates’ Court. Race row: The moment Terry (in the black shirt) is accused of racially abusing QPR defender Ferdinand (centre left). He denies any wrong-doing . An FA statement read: ‘Following the decision to adjourn the court case against John Terry to July, the FA confirm he will not captain the England team until the allegations against him are resolved. ‘The FA board expected the trial to be concluded prior to the European Championship. Further to Wednesday’s confirmation that the trial will not take place until after the tournament, the board has  collectively decided it is in the interests of all parties that John has the responsibilities of captaincy removed at this time. ‘This decision has been taken due to the higher profile nature of the captaincy, on and off the pitch, and the demands and requirements expected of the captain leading into and during a tournament. ‘The FA board can confirm that he has not been excluded from the squad and that Fabio Capello is free to select him for the Holland fixture on February 29 and the European Championship. ‘FA chairman David Bernstein has spoken to John Terry and Fabio Capello to explain the facts to them. Fabio Capello has not been involved in the FA board discussions which reached this conclusion, but understands that the FA board has authority to make this decision. ‘Fabio Capello will take the decision as to who will be made captain moving forward. ‘This decision in no way infers any suggestion of guilt in relation to  the charge made against John Terry. The FA will not be making any further comment on this matter.’ Steven Gerrard is the odds-on favourite to take John Terry's armband for the Euro 2012 opener, according to Ladbrokes. The Liverpool skipper is a warm 2/5 favourite to take over from Terry should he be stripped of captaincy, with Joe Hart next in at 5/1. Hart's teammate Gareth Barry earns an 8/1 quote while Chelsea's Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole are outsiders at 20/1 and 33/1 respectively. Terry is also now odds-on (8/11) to not start the opening match against France. Alex Donohue of Ladbrokes said: 'Gerrard appears the obvious choice with the odds reflecting that. 'Should the armband be passed to another Chelsea player punters will be in for a bumper payday.'","Chelsea defender, 31, informed of FA's decision this morning .

Michael Yardley, 35, had a seven-month affair with the child before his shocked wife Stephanie caught them kissing and cuddling on the sofa in the living room of the marital home. The PCSO, employed by Lincolnshire Police, was caught out after getting up early to tell his wife he was going for a run, according to Andrew Scott, prosecuting. Instead he went downstairs and let the girl into the house. His wife later went downstairs and caught them kissing on the sofa. Jailed for raping a schoolgirl: PSCO Michael Yardley, 35, had a seven-month affair with the 12-year-old . The couple separated and Yardley's wife later raised her suspicions with his employers, sparking an investigation. Both Yardley and the girl, who was by then 13, admitted having sex with each other on several occasions both . at Yardley's home and in his car. The girl, who cannot be named for . legal reasons, told police they had agreed between them that they would . set up home together when she reached 18. Mr Scott said: 'He befriended this . girl and took advantage of her. Her parents trusted him and did not . consider for one moment that anything untoward was happening.' 'Disgraceful': Yardley was today sentenced to ten years imprisonment at Lincoln Crown Court (pictured) Yardley had previously laughed off . suggestions that the girl had a crush on him and even managed to . convince her father that nothing was wrong, despite the fact that he . discovered she had sent 200 text messages to him. Yardley, of Morton, Lincolnshire, . admitted raping the girl on October 27, 2010 when she was 12 and four . charges of sexual activity with a young girl between November 2010 and . April this year. He was jailed for ten years and placed on the sex offenders' register for life. Yardley quit his role as a PCSO after the offences came to light. Recorder John Philpotts told him: 'These offences are extremely grave because of her age and the difference in age between you. 'Her parents thought their child was safe in your care. They were mistaken. 'You used the fact that her parents trusted you to take care of her. You used that to abuse her in the most disgraceful fashion. 'Your behaviour was persistent and it was prolonged. This has devastated the victim's family. The long-term emotional and psychological effects on the victim can only be guessed. I have no doubt they will be serious and considerable.' Alison Summers, defending, said Yardley developed a friendship with the girl after becoming unhappy in his marriage. She said: 'He realised he shouldn't have married. He felt his life was out of control. It was against that background of personal crisis that it would appear that his judgement was lost. 'I can only relate his remorse and his shame.' Detective Inspector Guy Leach said described Yardley as 'a very dangerous person to young girls' He said: 'Yardley has taken advantage and abused the trust of friends and a young girl. As a consequence of his conduct,the childhood and adolescence of this young girl has been stolen.'","Michael Yardley, 35, and schoolgirl 'made plans' to move in together when she turned 18 .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Last updated at 10:49 PM on 3rd February 2012 . A new study of Facebook trends shows that a reliance on a small but highly active group of users may prove costly for the company as it prepares to go public. Pew Research Center reports that only 20-30 per cent of Facebook's 843 million users are deemed 'power users', the most active on the social networking site. This figure comes as Facebook begins the process of trying to convince investors that their users' brand loyalty will amount to large financial gains, and is expecting a $100billion evaluation when initial public offering is set. The vast majority of activity on Facebook comes from a minority of its users who are much more dedicated than others . The research collected by Pew suggests that its users are not suffering from 'Facebook fatigue', but rather the opposite: the emotional connection that users have with the network encourage them to keep coming back to the site. This finding is strategically important for the company this week as they finally started the process of becoming a publicly traded company. Even though users do seem to be happy on the site, there is undoubtedly a constant fear that their biggest base may leave. If those 'power users' were to leave the leading social network, that could pose major problems for the company because of the vast amount of activity that would flee with them. * Data from the Pew Research Center . Power users made their presence on . the site known by tagging photos, sending friend requests, and 'liking' their peers' activities. On . Wednesday, Facebook took the first formal steps in the process to set . an initial public offering price, and said that they hoped for $5billion . of stock. Industry analysts see this as an effort to start the push low as the stock is expected to eventually value at $100billion. Given the fluidity of technology . trends, the fear of a hot new start-up is a constant one for Facebook, . but the researchers at Pew seem to think that users' emotional . connection with the site will keep them logging in for years to come. The study focused on user demographics, and found that female users are far more active than their male friends. Female users made 21 updates- which . could be any form of noticeable activity like sending requests, . commenting on other posts, or posting their own material- per month, . while their average male counterpart only made 6 updates in the same . amount of time. The . research suggests that it isn't just the fun of clicking away that has . captured users' attention for the eight years since it was created. It's . the feeling they get in doing so. Facebook provides a self-esteem boost . because of the positive emotional connotations that users remember from . seeing their friends and interacting with them online. Happy head: Mark Zuckerberg, who created the social networking giant, is bound to make billions off the IPO . Facebook itself has taken an active role in promoting positive thoughts instead of negative ones as well, by choosing to only offer 'like' buttons on posts and they have resisted calls for the introduction of a 'dislike' button- similar to the one seen on YouTube videos. 'You keep getting all these wonderful positive rewards,' Keith Hampton, the study's author, told The Associated Press. Those warm, fuzzy feelings that Facebook invokes may be the key to their brand loyalty strategy, which Mr Hampton suggests is working since the user base only continues to expand as the years go on. 'That's pretty hard to give up. For most people, the longer they are on Facebook, the more they do on Facebook,' he continued. Grateful: Facebook staffers, including Zuckerberg (center, just below the text) thanked its users as the IPO process formally began on Wednesday when they filed the first paperwork .","Facebook began formal process of becoming a publicly traded company this week and are expecting a total valuation of $100billion .

"By . James Tozer . Last updated at 12:56 PM on 4th February 2012 . A married family doctor was secretly recorded by a female patient as they engaged in a sex session at his surgery, a disciplinary panel heard yesterday. Dr Simon Robinson is accused of misconduct over a 16-month affair with the patient that ended when she began to feel ‘used’. The General Medical Council heard yesterday that their encounters always stopped short of full sexual intercourse and Robinson allegedly said he did not want to go further than oral sex as it would be ‘crossing the line’ for a married man. Accused: Dr Simon Robinson with his wife Catherine arriving at the General Medical Council hearing in Manchester . But the woman, referred to as Patient A, started to feel the relationship was one-sided and used her mobile phone to record the sounds of two of their alleged sex sessions, one at his surgery and one at her home. The panel is due to listen to the recordings in Robinson’s presence to examine his claim that they are fabrications in which the sounds of sexual pleasure have been added later. Patient A told the panel yesterday their relationship began after she went for a routine check-up at his surgery in Oswestry, Shropshire, the day before her birthday in July 2009. As she left, he kissed her ‘and said words to the effect of “come back tomorrow, I’ll give you a birthday present” ’. She said she felt ‘really flattered’. Allegations: GMC heard Dr Simon Robinson's said going further than oral sex would be 'crossing the line' for a married man . The following day, when she visited the surgery, he kissed her again and wished her happy birthday but told her to leave as he was busy. A week later he telephoned her and said he was going to ‘pop round’ to her home, she said, and when he arrived they sat on the sofa and began kissing. ‘He made it quite clear he wanted more than just a kiss – he was putting my hand on the inside of his thigh,’ she added. She went on to perform a sex act on him, she said. The next time she visited his surgery, he allegedly locked the door behind her. ‘He held my hand and started to talk to me, kiss me and started to take his trousers off and took my top off,’ she said. The panel in Manchester heard they began seeing each other two or three times a week at her home or his surgery – and that Robinson begged her to keep their relationship secret. Patient A said that when she asked him why they had not progressed to full sexual intercourse, he replied: ‘I can’t do that because that would be crossing the line – I’m married.’ Patient A also alleged that Robinson – who is in his 40s – asked her to make a request for an out-of-hours GP visit when he was doing a shift for an on-call service. After a year, the GMC heard, Patient A became unhappy with the relationship and confided in her adult sons. They were appalled and suggested she record one of their sessions as evidence against him. She did so at his surgery and at her home in November 2010, using a hidden mobile phone. The panel heard Patient A had been ‘a willing participant in this affair’, but Robin Kitching, counsel for the GMC, said Robinson’s behaviour had been dishonest and a breach of good medical practice. He added: ‘The doctor accepts he overstepped the mark in terms of doctor-patient boundaries but vehemently denies a sexual relationship took place.’ The case continues.","Dr Simon Robinson 'had 16-month affair with patient'

A restaurant owned by Lady Gaga's parents has been panned by a top critic who branded the food 'unspeakably fatty' and the waiters 'clueless'. Italian eatery 'Joanne Trattoria' was savaged by the New York Post's Steve Cuozzo for serving up 'calamari like leather' and 'shellfish pasta similar to airplane food'. The press had been banned from the opening but the savage critic managed to get a place inside the restaurant. The famously caustic Cuozzo tore into the menu, claiming that some of the food was, 'the worst I've had in a lifetime'. Cynthia and Joseph Germanotta, parents of Lady Gaga, who have opened a restaurant in New York. Right, the eccentric star performs in Times Square on New Year's Eve . Crowds gather outside Joanne Trattoria in Manhattan on Wednesday, during its grand opening. The restaurant was panned by top critic Steve Cuozzo . In an article entitled 'You'll Gag on the Food at Gaga's', Cuozzo slammed the waiters and the dishes. 'You don't expect a brand-new eatery to be running on all cylinders,' he wrote. 'But Joanne, owned by the pop superstar's parents, last night was running mainly on acrid-smelling burnt vinegar wafting intermittently through the raucous dining room.' Cuozzo complained about the the 'unspeakably fatty veal osso bucco,' which he said was overpriced at $38 (£24), and he criticised the appetizers that took 50 minutes to arrive. Despite boasting the highly rated TV . chef Art Smith as it food chief, the Big Apple tabloid goes on to . describe the service as 'plucked from the 'burbs' and 'clueless'. The 25-year old singer's parents Joseph and Cynthia Germanotta will be hoping the review doesn't have a negative effect on bookings. Named after Gaga's aunt, Joanne, who died of lupus aged 19, the Grammy award winning pop star has often said the late painter was an inspiration to her. With traditional New York home-style wooden furnishings which the New York Post found to be 'plain cramped' and 'loud as an avalanche', the restaurant is a far cry from Lady Gaga's crazy style. Legendary singer Tony Bennett arrives at Lady Gaga's parents' restaurant. Right, the star poses with Mr Germanotta after eating . Mrs Germanotta, Lady Gaga's mother (centre) mingles with guests during the opening evening at the restaurant. The family are unlikely to be pleased by the review . And during last nights ill fated service it seemed that Lady Gaga's father Joseph himself was walking around the front of house. This is the first time that he and his wife have dabbled in the restaurant business and Joseph, a former internet entrepreneur, is excited by the prospect. 'This has been a lifelong dream, and I couldn't be happier that it's finally happening,' he told New York's Daily News yesterday. The Italian menu features recipes not just from Lady Gaga, but also Joseph and Gaga's grandmother. Meals . at 'Joanne' include include Wood Fired Focaccia, Zucchini Fritters, . Tomato Fennel Soup, Chopped Antipasti Salad, Papa Joe's Chicken, Grandma . Ronnie's Meatballs and Six Layer Lasagna. The . menu was designed by Mr  Smith, who famously worked for talk show queen . Oprah Winfrey in 2007. He cooked for Gaga on the Oprah Show some years . back. Cosy: The outdoor courtyard features an open fireplace where guests can keep warm . Home-style: The eatery features a huge wooden bar with comfy leather bar stools . Gourmet Gaga: Cutlery is laid out on the tables hours before the guests arrived on the opening night . 'This is truly a collaborative effort, inspired by the Germanotta's family love of food and family,' Joseph told the Daily News. 'Everything from the menu to the decor has a bit of their family in it. It's why everything is so warm and approachable.' The decor inside the establishment is the complete polar opposite to the singer's eccentric style. The eatery features wooden tables, leather booths, open brick walls, and warm-coloured painted walls. Portraits and photographs of the Germanotta family are dotted throughout, and guests can enjoy an open fireplace in the outside courtyard. Meanwhile, the Poker Face cinger has revealed she wants a child but in her usual style has divulged a series of demands, including the father must be Italian and conception would be through artificial insemination. Gaga is notoriously private about her love life, but earlier this week she told Spain's Radio Ibiza she was looking for a partner to have a child with, but they must share her Italian and Sicilian roots. She said: 'I want a baby from an Italian - possibly Sicilian - donor.' Lady Gaga's father Joseph originally comes from the village of Naso in Sicily.","Food is 'unspeakably fatty' and waiters are 'clueless', says Steve Cuozzo ."
"By . Jason Groves and James White . Last updated at 9:24 AM on 3rd February 2012 . Network Rail sparked fury last night with plans for a £20million bonus package for six top executives just days after the company admitted it breached safety laws over the level crossing deaths of two schoolgirl friends. The failing transport giant, which receives £4billion a year in public subsidies, claimed the ‘incentives’ would help it improve its performance, which was heavily criticised by regulators in December. The deal will entitle the firm’s six executive directors to annual bonuses worth up to 60 per cent of their salaries. They will also share in a long-term bonus pool worth up to £15.6million over the next three years. In total, the directors could enjoy total bonuses of almost £20million by 2015. Network Rail this week admitted health and safety breaches over the deaths of Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and Charlotte Thompson, 13, pictured, shortly before the huge bonus for Sir David Higgins was announced . Network Rail chief executive Sir David Higgins (left) is under pressure to reject a potential £340,000 bonus after ex-Labour rail minister Tom Harris (right) tabled a Commons motion calling on him to turn down the payment . The news came after Network Rail admitted three health and safety charges in relation to the deaths of Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and Charlotte . Thompson, 13, who were hit by a high-speed train as they went Christmas . shopping together in 2005. The friends stepped on to the tracks . while trying to catch their train at Elsenham in Essex but failed to . spot another service travelling in the opposite direction. The girls' fathers this week accused the transport giant of a high-level cover-up of damning reports that proved it knew of the dangers of the crossing. Network Rail chief executive Sir David Higgins will qualify for an annual bonus of up £336,000 on top of his £560,000 ‘basic’ salary. His share of the long-term bonus pool could be worth as much as £3.8million. Transport . Secretary Justine Greening said the plans were ‘unacceptable’ and urged . directors to ‘exercise restraint’ but said she was unable to block the . bonuses. Last night she was under mounting pressure from MPs on all . sides to intervene. It comes after RBS chief Stephen Hester decided to waive his £1m bonus earlier this week following mounting public and political pressure. Tory MP . Anne Main, who led a Commons debate yesterday on Network Rail’s . ‘shambolic’ performance, described the proposals as a ‘disgrace’. She . added: ‘If we are serious about being a Government that tackles fat cat . pay and bonuses in the public sector then the situation at Network Rail . has to come under scrutiny.’ Former . Labour rail minister Tom Harris yesterday tabled a Commons motion, . signed by 27 other MPs from his party, calling on Sir David and the . firm’s directors to turn down any bonuses. And . Labour transport spokesman Maria Eagle accused Miss Greening of failing . to exercise her right to attend the company’s remuneration committee, . which drew up the proposals. She added: ‘Passengers who have suffered . fare rises of up to 13 per cent in January and deteriorating performance . on our railways will be staggered.’ David . Cameron’s official spokesman said reports of the size of Sir David’s . proposed bonus were ‘speculative’, but added: ‘The Prime Minister has . been very clear about his views on pay and bonuses and he has . consistently said he wants to see responsibility and restraint.’ The spokesman said the issue was a matter for Miss Greening.

They were hit by a . train in 2005 as they crossed the tracks at Elsenham station footpath . crossing in Essex. The firm last night insisted that ‘no decision’ had been taken on whether bonuses would be paid. A . spokesman said the proposal for bonuses worth 60 per cent of salaries . represented a major reduction on the 100 per cent bonuses paid in some . previous years.

Police have unveiled a laser speed camera that is so accurate it can . tell if drivers are using a mobile phone or not wearing a seatbelt from . nearly half a mile away. Officers say it will help in their zero-tolerance approach to motoring offences. But critics say Dorset police are using the equipment to 'maximise the number of offences' simply to raise funds. The camera has a traditional laser scanner, like normal speed guns, but also has an HD camera controlled via a 6.4-inch touchscreen . Dorset police will begin using the hi-tech laser cameras in their speed camera vans (pictured) The £12,500 Concept . II is fitted with laser speed-detection equipment and a powerful camera . that can capture motorists in the 'act' of using a mobile phone while . driving or not wearing a seat belt. The resolution is . sharp enough to pick out an unbuckled belt at ranges of up to 600 . metres, records image and video evidence to DVD. The rural force has launched a zero-tolerance campaign . against motoring offences such as using mobile phones while driving, after incidents including a man playing a harmonica at the wheel of his car. Project manager Brian Austin said: 'Bizarrely, officers at one of the sites in Dorchester were stunned to see a driver pass them while playing a harmonica using both hands. 'He claimed that he thought he was driving while playing the harmonica quite successfully.' Officers will be able to use the pictures as evidence to secure a conviction. Dorset police have . bought two of them at a cosdt of £25,000 which will be used from current . speed camera vans. The police say that they aim to use the cameras at . ranges of around 400 metres.

Desperate families who were talked into selling their homes and then renting them back in order to pay-off mortgage arrears and other debts were conned, the City watchdog said. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) has issued a damning verdict on the firms behind these ‘sale and rent back’ schemes. The companies, generally small specialist finance firms, offered to buy the home of a client – generally for around 60-70per cent of its true market value. The idea was that the family involved would get a lump sum to clear the mortgage and other debts yet still be able to remain in their home paying rent . The idea was that the family involved would get a lump sum to clear the mortgage and other debts yet still be able to remain in their home paying rent. However, many did not realise that their right to stay could be limited to just five years, while the cash sums involved were often too little to clear their debts and rents were high. In a ruling published yesterday, the FSA said: ‘Most sale and rent back (SRB) transactions were either unaffordable or unsuitable and never should have been sold’. The watchdog has effectively shut down the entire industry with immediate effect, while it is investigating bringing legal action against at least one of the firms. Five companies involved in selling the deals have been ordered to look through their books in order to offer redress, which could include cancelling the contracts, to victims of the scam. However, it has emerged that the protection offered by the FSA only relates to 61 families who took out sale and rent back (SRB) schemes since 2009, which is when the watchdog began regulating the sector. By contrast, another 50,000 people who took out the schemes before 2009 could be left high and dry. The FSA has said they will need to pursue their own claims against the firms involved. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) has issued a damning verdict on the firms behind these 'sale and rent back' schemes . Head of the FSA’s mortgage and general insurance supervision, Nausicaa Delfas(both correct), said: ‘Sale and rent back is often the last resort for struggling homeowners so we expected to see firms treating their customers much better than this report suggests. ‘The resulting temporary closure of this market could have been avoided if sale and rent back firms had taken the time to fully understand their regulatory responsibilities and customers’ needs. ‘It seems most were more focussed on their own commercial success rather than the welfare of the customers, with one firm even resorting to fraud.’ The FSA has found that SRB firms did not correctly assess whether the schemes were appropriate or affordable for the people involved. Customers were not given enough time to consider the agreement. The sales processes were inadequate and did not allow firms to gather enough information to properly assess whether it was the best option for the family involved. The promotion of the schemes were inaccurate, while the sales staff did not get the necessary training and were not competent. A study published by consumer champion, Which?, a year ago found advice to SRB  customers was ‘woefully inadequate’. Of the 17 advisers across nine firms contacted by Which? Money,  just two offered acceptable advice. Which? chief executive, Peter Vicary-Smith, said: ‘It’s welcome news that the FSA has taken action to stop people falling prey to shoddy advice from sale and rent back firms. ‘We exposed the shortcomings of this market last year, after our own investigation uncovered woefully inadequate advice. ‘We now want to see redress for those consumers who have been given poor advice by SRB companies, and for this to happen quickly.’",FSA issues damning verdict on firms behind 'sale and rent back' schemes .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:49 PM on 4th February 2012 . The continuing storm over City bonuses is damaging Britain's reputation as a place to do business, a group of leading international bankers has warned. Government ministers have been accused of trying to gain public favour this week by stripping former RBS chief Fred Goodwin of his knighthood and pressurising current RBS chief executive Stephen Hester to reject a £1 million bonus. One senior executive at a Wall Street bank told The Times: 'London is now the worst major centre in the world to do banking.' The City under attack: Could government pressure on financial institutions drive them out of the City of London for good? The anti-banking bandwagon is only set to worsen in the next few days with the bonus announcement of Bob Diamond, Barclays chief executive. Directors of privately-owned banks are concerned public pressure will be put on them to reduce or reject annual bonuses in the light of Mr Hester's decision to waive a bonus this week. Investment banker Nicola Horlick, a university friend of Mr Hester has warned against a 'witchhunt' towards bankers. 'You shouldn't underestimate the importance of financial services to the country,' she told The Times. 'Without it we would be in dire straits. Let's not kill the golden goose that saved the country. She said it was short-sighted to demonise Mr Hester when he was trying to raise the share price so the public could get its money back. Mr Hester, chief executive of the 82 per cent publicly-owned Royal Bank of Scotland was the subject of sustained calls from government ministers and Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, to relinquish a bonus at such a politically-sensitive time. 'Bashing people up doesn't itself help': Public pressure this week has seen former RBS chief Fred Goodwin have his knighthood removed and current RBS chief exec Stephen Hester forced to reject a £1 million bonus . Several top banks, including HSBC and Standard Chartered are concerned that attacks on bonuses will cause shareholders to push from a move away from the UK so they can still attract the best staff, who may be put off the UK by any blocks on windfalls. Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of RBS told The Times the government and others had embarked on an anti-business bandwagon. Let's not kill the golden goose: Now an investment banker, Nicola Horlick has warned against the current witchhunt towards bankers . 'Bashing people who are actually there . to help, doesn't itself help. We knew there would be a reaction..but the . scale of it took us by surprise. I think it took the Government by . surprise too.' A senior banker then compared David . Cameron and George Osborne to Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by having one . opinion out of the gaze of the public and another in front of the . cameras. 'They come out . with all the right language to us in private.  But they can't resist the . call of the mob. Has this reduced our respect for the coalition? The . answer without a shadow of a doubt is yes.' Ed . Miliband and David Cameron have both given speeches in the last week . criticising high City bonuses, with Mr Miliband trying to get the House . of Commons to vote on Tuesday to end 'bonus culture'. Stuart Popham, head of pro-banking . group TheCityUK, is worried the attacks will drive a rift between the . financial world and the government, which is a vital relationship when . the economy is struggling. The . fear is that banks will leave the City of London altogether, in favour . of more favourable treatment in Asia or America.  A move which would be . catastrophic for the UK economy in terms of jobs and investment. Will he or won't he? The decision of Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond to take a bonus or not this year will have a huge bearing on the rest of the banking industry . The financial services industry accounts for 8.9 per cent of the total output of the UK, and contributes 2.8 per cent of GDP. The . Conservative Party is having to tread a fine line on this issue as it . has always traditionally been seen as pro-business, and relies on the . City for a large chuck of its funding. In 2011 more than half of the £12.2 million donated to the party came from donors linked to the City. Many supporters of the party are now calling for a softening in the criticism of banking practices.

Over 100 passengers including students and teachers, were feared drowned last night after a ferry carrying as many as 350 sank off the coast of Papua New Guinea. Australian Maritime Safety Authority have confirmed that 230 survivors have been rescued so far after the MV Rabaul Queen went down while travelling from Kimbe on the island of New Britain to the coastal town of Lae on the main island. A Star Ships spokesman told AFP that 'bad weather' was believed to have sunk the ship. Awaiting rescue: Three life rafts from the MV Rabaul Queen float above the sunken hull of the ferry in the open waters off Papua New Guinea's east coast, so far 230 people have been rescued . Helicopter rescue: An aerial view of people in an inflatable life raft - the ferry sent out a distress signal but went down shortly after . Sunk: The MV Rabaul Queen, pictured in an undated photo, had around 350 people on board when it went down off Papua New Guinea . Anxious wait: Concerned family members and relatives of the passengers on board the Rabaul Queen waiting for news at the Provincial Disaster Office in Lae . The ferry sent out a distress . signal but went down shortly after. A plane from Australia, three helicopters and six ships were scouring the search area after the ship's distress signal was detected by the Australian maritime agency. Papua New Guinea's rescue coordinator Captain Nurur Rahman said four merchant ships had been immediately diverted to the scene to help with the rescue. He told the BBC he had reports of people floating in life jackets where the boat sank. A Star Ships spokesman told AFP that 'bad weather' was believed to have sunk the ship. Tragic: The incident happened when the ferry was travelling between two different parts of Papua New Guinea . Australian prime minister Julia Gillard said there were 350 people aboard and that Australia was providing assistance to its near neighbour. Tragic: Australian prime minister said there was a 'likely very high loss of life' after the ferry sank . 'This is obviously a major tragedy,' she told reporters in Melbourne. 'Given the likely very high loss of . life here, I think when this news comes to the attention of Australians . around the country they will be thinking about the people of PNG as they . respond to this tragedy.' Reports after the incident did not . confirm how the ship had managed to sink, although overcrowding on boats . in Papua New Guinea has previously seen them capsize in similar . situations. The Australian Maritime Safety . Authority said the Rabaul Queen had gone down about 10 miles off the . coast of Finschhafen, some 50 miles from its final destination of Lae. The ferry's operator, Rabaul Shipping, said it had lost contact with the vessel in the early hours of the morning. Police in Kimbe said most of the passengers were students and trainee teachers. Foreign embassies are trying to establish if any of their nationals were on board - Kimbe is a popular dive site that attracts tourists from around the world. It was the second major disaster to hit the country, which lies to the north of Australia, in less than two weeks following a landslide in the central highlands which wiped out an entire village, killing around 60 people. It said 350 people were believed to be on board, but Papua New Guinea's National Maritime Safety Authority (NMSA) rescue co-ordinator Captain Nurur Rahman said the true figure was likely lower. 'I cannot confirm or deny the 350 missing number. It is hearsay,' Rahman said. 'I have not seen the manifest as yet, but it is likely around 300. Rahman said he was being fed information from an NMSA agent on board one of the ships. 'The dynamics of this thing are changing all the time, minute by minute,' he said. Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd said he has spoken to his Papua New Guinea counterpart to offer assistance.'Our hearts go out to those affected by the sinking,' Mr. Rudd said in a statement.'","Students and teachers thought to have been on board MV Rabaul Queen .

"By . Jack Doyle . Last updated at 8:51 AM on 3rd February 2012 . Justice Secretary Ken Clarke will also slash the time period before convictions become 'spent' Hundreds of thousands of criminals will have their convictions wiped under ‘rehabilitation’ plans revealed last night. Rapists, paedophiles and even some killers will overnight be relieved of any obligation to declare their crimes when applying for a job. Justice Secretary Ken Clarke will also slash the time period before convictions become ‘spent’, to help criminals get back into work. Yesterday ministers said it was right that criminals had a ‘fair chance of getting back on the straight and narrow’. The Government admitted the changes could expose some employers to ‘greater risk of harm through their re-offending’. But it insisted the risk was ‘small’ because reoffending rates decline sharply within a few years of release. Previously, anyone given a jail sentence of more than two and a half years would have to declare their offence to prospective employers for the rest of their lives. From next year, that will apply only to those given a sentence of more than four years – meaning many more serious offenders will be able to declare themselves ‘clean’ after a period of time has elapsed. Serious offenders with a sentence of between 30 months and four years will no longer have to declare their convictions after seven years. This will include some killers with manslaughter convictions, as well as rapists and paedophiles. Sentences of between six months and 30 months – the kind given to violent thugs and drug dealers – will expire after four years instead of the current ten. And those given up to six months in jail, which can include burglars, will be clear after two years instead of seven. But the time periods will be calculated from the end of the sentence, instead of the date of conviction as is currently the case. Rapists, paedophiles and even some killers will overnight be relieved of any obligation to declare their crimes when applying for a job . Court fines will be expunged after one year rather than five, and the same will apply to community sentences. The . rules will also be retrospective, meaning criminals who committed . serious crimes in the distant past will benefit immediately. Last . night David Green, director of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘There are . some employers who are willing to give people a second chance and . that’s a good thing. But it’s better if they know they have a doubtful . history. ‘By spending . convictions rapidly you are deceiving people. These days no one gets put . in prison unless they have done something pretty bad. I think this is . sending the wrong message.’ Jailed: Muhammed Tayyab sexually assaulted a teenager and punched her in the face . Muhammed Tayyab sexually assaulted a teenager and punched her in the face in an ordeal lasting nearly an hour. The 38-year-old was jailed for four years last November, but under the new rules he would have his conviction wiped seven years after the end of his sentence. Currently he would have to declare the conviction to prospective employers for the rest of his life. Tayyab grabbed the 19-year-old after she left her friends in a bar and pulled her into a recess on Blackpool Promenade. The 45-minute attack in the early hours of May 6 last year only came to an end when the woman was able to remove his hand from her mouth and begin screaming, alerting three passers-by. Police said CCTV showed Tayyab hanging around outside the bar  waiting for his victim, then following her when she left. Officers said he picked the woman, who was celebrating a friend’s birthday, because she was drunk and vulnerable. Tayyab admitted the offence at Preston Crown Court and was ordered to serve four years for the sexual assault, with a four-month sentence for the punch in the face to be  served concurrently. Detective Constable Alan Quanbrough, from Blackpool CID, described the assault as ‘particularly nasty and violent’. ‘It was only by luck three men walked past and the victim was eventually able to get away,’ he added. ‘She was able to scream and Tayyab’s prolonged attack was interrupted.’ Police were able to track down the attacker because he was wearing his work name badge at the time of the assault. The victim, who was visiting from Manchester for a couple of nights, was left bruised and shaken after the attack. Officials insisted that indeterminate sentences for public protection would never be spent, nor would new extended sentences for the most serious sexual and violent crimes. Once a conviction is spent, employers cannot refuse to give an applicant a job or dismiss an employee because of it. Spent convictions will no longer show up in a basic Criminal Records Bureau check. But offenders will have to declare them when applying to work in schools, prisons or other ‘sensitive’ environments. Justice Minister Lord McNally said: ‘First and foremost, criminals must be suitably punished for their crimes. But it is no good for anyone if they go to jail and come out and then can’t get an honest job and so turn back to crime again.’","Ken Clarke wants to slash the time period before convictions become 'spent' to help get criminals back to work .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:08 PM on 4th February 2012 . Yankees boss Brian Cashman emerged in public today for the first time since his wife filed for divorce after humiliating claims he had an affair with his accused 'crazed stalker'. Scruffily dressed, he visited the family’s $3.7 million Darien mansion where his wife Mary has been living apart in the wake of the allegations - but the 44-year-old spent less than a minute inside, reports the new York Post. Mrs Cashman, 42, had said the marriage had 'broken down irretrievably' in the divorce papers submitted yesterday. It comes after alleged mistress Louise Neathway, who Mr Cashman previously attempted to have committed to a mental asylum, accused him of having an affair with her as she appeared in court on Thursday. Brian Cashman, pictured right, is being divorced by his wife Mary after Louise Neathway, pictured in court left, claimed she had an affair with the Yakees boss . She was charged with stalking Mr Cashman . and attempting to blackmail the Yankees boss for $6,000 with threats . she would reveal the alleged affair. The general manager's wife is seeking permanent alimony, half of their property and joint custody of their two children, reports the New York Post. British native Neathway, also known as Louise Meanwell, was arrested on Wednesday and is facing charges of grand larceny, stalking and harassment. Mrs Cashman, who endured the humiliation of an affair her husband had back in 2009, has been living apart from him in the family’s $3.7 million mansion with her daughter and son, sources told the Post. On Thursday prosecutors said Neathway harassed Cashman with hundreds of text messages, and demanded he give her $15,000 to pay for an unspecified medical procedure. She allegedly threatened to contact the press and his family with claims that would hurt his personal relationships and professional standing, according to a court complaint. Cashman made two payments, one for $4,000 and another for $2,000. Scandal: Brian Cashman has for the second time been publicly accused of having an affair, prompting his wife Mary to file for a divorce . Cashman even tried to get rid of his alleged mistress by urging her mother to have her committed, sources told the New York Daily News. He contacted Caroline Meanwell last week and told her that her daughter was mentally unstable and 'needs help', the sources said. The call led to a meeting between Meanwell, Cashman and his lawyer. Meanwell was presented with a report that stated her daughter was 'mentally unstable'. 'He told the mother she needed help,' one of the sources told the Daily News. 'He suggested to her that she try to have her committed' In a meeting on January 27, Cashman and Meanwell placed a conference call to Louise’s Manhattan psychiatrist, Charlotte Murphy, who agreed with Cashman, sources told the Post said. 'Everyone was convinced that [Louise] was a danger to herself or others,' one source told the Post. 'Murphy agreed that Louise was dangerous and violent, and that it was a serious situation. She said to call 911,'. Meanwell made the call which eventually led to her daughter's arrest. Mr Cashman claims he was stalked and blackmailed into handing over $6,000 to Louise Neathway . Neathway's lawyers said Mr Cashman was 'a . married man having an inappropriate relationship' with Neathway, a . medical sales worker and single mother of a 14-year-old daughter, and he . turned on her when it 'ended badly' Neathway’s lawyers claim their client is the real victim of a romance that . began in April and 'ended badly.' She . is also reported by the Post to have claimed to several friends that . she had a year long affair with Cashman which she ended after he did not . fulfill a promise to leave his wife. Neathway has a criminal history of harassment and trespassing going back to 1988 and spanning three states. She has allegedly been harassing her ex-husband Jason Bump, their daughter and a long line of boyfriends she’s had since her marriage broke up, reports the Post. 'She’s a very dangerous person. She’s a psychopath, in my estimation,' Mr Bump, told The Post. 'There’s currently an order of protection for myself, my daughter, my wife and my mother' against her. 'She has not seen our daughter in a few years, and she’s not allowed to contact her at all,' he said reports the Post. Cashman is the latest in a line of men who claim Neathway has tormented them with death threats, phone hacking and lies about miscarriages, court records and former friends claim, according to the Post. Cashman is the latest in the line of men who claim Neathway has tormented them with death threats, phone hacking and lies about miscarriages . In 2010 a former lover, who works on Wall Street, told the police that 'she has made many threatening statements aimed at me and has been e-mailing and phoning me constantly. 'She’s also begun waiting outside my apartment in the East Village,' court records said according to the Post. 'I am fearful for my safety and have no idea what this woman is capable of. As of this morning, she has hacked into my personal e-mail account and my Facebook account, deleting all my e-mails. I am VERY scared of her.' he ex-fling said. Mrs Cashman served her husband with divorce papers on January 31, the day before Neathway was arrested, reports the Post. The documents were filed in court yesterday.

Blighted by a tragic genetic condition - caused by her biological mother's addiction to meth- she was born with badly formed limbs and aged 11 months underwent a double amputation. For years she learned to walk using prosthetic legs but at the end of last year she moved on to carbon fibre blades, similar to those used by high profile South African athlete Oscar Pistorious, so she could participate in sporting events. Just months after receiving a pair of carbon fibre blades, nine-year-old Jessy Hatch completed her first run . And after a few months of training and the support of her adoptive parents.Jessy from Phoenix, Arizona, tackled her first mini marathon. Although she had already been playing sports, the running blades will allow her to compete in track activities. All of the money raised from the mile sponsored run will go to help others like her. Her foster mother Dawn said: 'Jessy is brilliant. She has a strong will and she’s resilient and smart.' As a baby Jessy was adopted by Dawn and Aaron Hatch who already looked after 23 other children. Many of the other foster children also had disabilities caused by drug addicted parents so the couple were prepared for the type of care Jessy would require. Because her legs were so badly formed at 11-months-old doctors amputated both of her legs above the knee. At the end of 2011, nine-year-old Jessy received her first pair of carbon fibre legs . Incredibly, after only a couple months of training, in January Jessy decided to participate in a one-mile fun run . A succession of prosthetic limbs allowed her to learn how . to walk as she grew older. At the end of 2011, aged nine she received her first pair of carbon fibre blades, which made it . possible for her to run for the first time. Incredibly, after only a couple . months of training at a local gym, Jessy decided to participate in a one-mile Kids Rock run in Tempe, Arizona this January. Dawn added: 'A double amputee exerts 250 per cent more energy when walking than we do. 'It took us nine years to get her healthy enough to wear these running legs. A little three or four- year-old can’t take in the 2100 calories needed to walk on artificial legs. 'So Jessy had to have a feeding tube inserted into her stomach to help beef her up. We just took it out in June 2011. After that she could have her running legs as she’d built up enough muscle mass.' Jessy’s contact with her biological . family is almost non-existent - she has never met her mother, but has visited her brother twice. Away from the running track Jessy helps to run a charity called ‘Jessy for Jeans’, which collects unwanted jeans and other clothing for disadvantaged children.

Dissident Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko was yesterday branded a 'traitor' by his own father. Litvinenko, 43, is believed to have been murdered by radioactive polonium-210 in 2006 after his tea was spiked at a top hotel. As he lay in agony on his death bed, he blamed Vladimir Putin - an accusation echoed at the time by his father Valter, now 73. But yesterday the pensioner begged forgiveness for the charge and accused his son of being a 'traitor' and a British spy. The attack on his own son - and a stunning volte face - comes as Valter, a widower, bids to win back the support of the Putin regime so he can return to Russia after a period of exile in Italy. In 2006, Valter had said of his son's . death: 'I have no doubt that it was done by the secret services on the . authority of Vladimir Putin.' He begged Russian TV: 'Help me, an old man, to get back to my country.' He said he suddenly realised his son's treachery 'like a click in my head' following revelations that he was paid by the British secret services after acting as a consultant on Russian organised crime. 'I ask you to forgive me, my motherland, forgive me for God's sake!' said a tearful and emotional Valter Litvinenko on state controlled Russian television. Tears: Valter Litvinenko, father of Alexander, pictured in 2006 at the time of his son's death . His son - a Putin enemy who fled Moscow for London - was 'a disgrace to me, to all of our family', he said. Litvinenko Senior accused prominent exiles in London of using him for their own ends to blacken the Russian premier's name. There was no immediate reaction from the Russian authorities on whether he would be welcomed back. Scotland Yard's main suspect in its . murder probe is Russian MP and ex-secret services agent Andrey Lugovoi. Russia has refused to extradite him to face murder charges. Last week MI5 and MI6 were ordered to hand over any secret documents concerning their alleged relationship with Mr Litvinenko. The . evidence will form part of a wide-ranging investigation into allegations . that Mr Litvinenko was killed by the Russian state while he was . working for the British security services. The request has been made by Dr Andrew Reid, the St Pancras coroner, who is conducting the inquest into Mr Litvinenko’s death. He has agreed to consider allegations that Mr Litvinenko was murdered because of his outspoken criticism of Vladimir Putin.

"By . Jaya Narain . Last updated at 12:04 AM on 1st December 2011 . In life Luca Giovannini was a  loving, lively and generous young boy who brought joy to everyone he met. And after he died suddenly at the age of five he has continued to spread happiness. For Luca has given the gift of life to four people after his organs were used in transplant operations. Gift: Luca Giovannini died just 24 hours after complaining he felt unwell. When doctors told his parents he was not going to survive they decided to donate his organs . One of those Luca has saved is a . two-year-old girl who was close to death and is now expected to be home . with her parents in time for Christmas. A two-year-old boy also benefited from a transplant, as did a 35-year-old mother of two and a man aged 34. Luca died just over 24 hours after he . was taken to hospital complaining of feeling sick. Doctors are yet to . confirm the cause of his death but believe he may have had a rare . reaction to the usually-treatable Epstein-Barr virus. Many children become infected with the . virus but these infections usually cause no symptoms or are . indistinguishable from other brief childhood illnesses. But in rare cases it can cause complications such as swelling of the brain and heart and problems with the nervous system. When doctors told Luca’s parents . Vickie and Renzo that their son was not going to survive they made the . decision that his death should not be in vain and that Luca would donate . some of his organs for transplant. Mr Giovannini, a 38-year-old financial . adviser from Stockport, said: ‘When the medics were trying to save . Luca’s life I asked a doctor what his chances were of surviving and he . said we were looking at the worst-case scenario. ‘It’s a scenario which no parent wants to be faced with, but it was at that stage that we discussed organ donation. Luca was taken by ambulance from Wythenshawe Hospital (pictured) to Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, where doctors battled in vain to save his life . ‘We mentioned to the ward matron that . we would like him considered for donation because we wanted something . positive to come out of this. ‘We send Luca’s organs with love to . all these people, especially to the little girl who they told us was . just days away from dying. ‘She is now expected to leave hospital on Friday and be home in time for Christmas. ‘Luca did a lot of things in his short . life whereas these two children have never been out of hospital and now . hopefully they will get the chance to live similar lives.’ The little . boy, who loved gymnastics, fell ill at 4am on November 14 and died at . 7am the next day. Mr Giovannini said: ‘One week we were . thinking about buying Luca his Christmas present and the next we were . looking for a grave for him. ‘He was such a lively lad who never sat still and he had such a sunny disposition and was a very happy little boy.’ Luca was taken by ambulance from . Wythenshawe Hospital to Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital where . doctors battled in vain to save his life. Janet Ayling, his teacher at St Hugh’s . RC Primary in Timperley, said: ‘Somehow Luca’s love of life and his . spirit will live on in all of us. ‘He will leave a legacy for all of us . to follow – his beautiful smile, his gentle nature, and his whole happy . being will never be forgotten.’ An inquest has been opened and adjourned. The funeral  of Luca, who also leaves a brother Leo, two, took place yesterday. Because the death of a child is often not foreseen, many families do not consider the possibility of organ donation. It is therefore not common for . children to become organ donors to adults although the organs of . children can be transplanted into adults successfully. Last week two children killed in a shooting in North Carolina saved 12 lives between them by organ donation. Hannaleigh Michelle Suttles, eight, and 14-year-old Zachary Lee Smith were gunned down by Mary Ann Holder, 36, in Greensboro. One person can save up to eight lives . with their transplantable organs, which include the heart, lungs, liver, . kidneys, pancreas and small intestine. Tissue donations can benefit up to 50 people.",One of Luca's organs saves a two-year-old girl who was days away from death .

Teenagers Amber Henry and Kirsten Kamradt were discovered by U.S. marshals and FBI agents after they were forced across state lines by the 19-year-old boys. The two girls, who are from Georgia, went missing from their homes early on Wednesday. They were thought to have been picked up in a white Buick at about 1am by driver Joshua Crowe and his friend Dustin Elliott. Safe and well: Teenagers Amber Henry (left) and Kirsten Kamradt (right) were discovered by U.S. marshals and FBI agents . The two young men, who had met the girls on a social networking site, took the younger teenagers on a joyride, but - according to police - it turned ugly when they took them across state lines into Tennessee. One of the them raised the alarm when the car stopped at a gas station. Captain Todd Pippin, from Lamar County Sheriff's Department, said: 'Amber was released at a gas station and called for help. Kirsten was still in the suspect's vehicle. Detectives found the vehicle in Hamblen County and pulled it over moments ago.' He added: 'We are just happy they've been found and the families can have peace.' Jennifer Kamradt, Kirsten's mother, only discovered her daughter was missing when she went to wake her for school. She said: 'I woke up to get her to school at about seven in the morning -- she wasn't there.' According to Barry, one of the men may have a psychological condition that put the girls in danger. Both Crowe and Elliott were taken into custody and are now facing kidnapping charges.","Teenagers found by FBI and U.S. marshals .

"By . Will Stewart . Last updated at 7:42 PM on 3rd February 2012 . The last picture of writer Colin Adams in a Moscow bar, taken the evening before he died after becoming involved in an altercation with a hotel barman . The family of a British writer and former army officer who died last month in Moscow fear the Russian police are seeking to cover-up his murder or manslaughter. Colin Adams, 70, who penned a book on climbing in the Welsh mountains, was staying at a large tourist hotel when a late night and unexplained altercation with a barman and a subsequent fall evidently led to his death. In a plot that could have come straight out of a John le Carré thriller he became involved in a mysterious  late night  altercation with a hotel barman and a subsequent fall is believed to have led to his death. But police have showed little . enthusiasm for fully probing events around the incident and an . investigation launched by his ex-wife Elena Adams, 57, and son Roger, . has raised some probing questions. Mrs . Adams fears a cover-up may be underway to protect the reputation of the . Kosmos hotel, built for the 1980 Olympics and one of the largest in . Moscow. The family . have now abandoned plans to have the author's remains cremated in . Moscow and have brought his body back for a new autopsy in Britain. As . a result, their suspicions have only deepened over the fate of a . healthy man who seemed ten or more years younger than his age, authored . authoritative book The Mountain Walker's Guide to Wales, and is known to . have met members of the Royal Family. 'Moscow . police now claim it was not a crime, and have ruled out any criminal . investigation,' said Riga-born Elena, who remained a close friend after . her divorce from the writer. She . went to  Moscow on behalf of the family to collect his belongings but . immediately became deeply concerned over the circumstances of his . death. 'I am not satisfied with what the police say, but I am at a loss what to do next.' With the help of the British Embassy, she went to the mortuary where she was at first blocked from seeing Mr Adams' body.  Finally, she persuaded the director to let her in, and she was given one minute but banned from taking pictures. 'To say I was shocked is to say nothing,' she said. 'I had read all the news stories on the web about his death, and so I knew he had fallen and received head injuries. 'But I could not imagine such a hole in his temple. I could have easily put all my five fingers inside it. 'It had dried blood all over it and when my eyes moved further I saw another hole right on the top of his head, also huge, large enough to insert my hand had I wanted to.' She met the police investigator - 'she was a very young woman, aged 20 I think, and I could hardly believe my eyes. I'm sure  it is easy to influence somebody so young. 'She showed me the short handwritten note in the official file where Colin's injuries were described. 'I could hardly read the scrawl. It was in bad handwriting and just several lines long. I was not allowed to make a copy of it. The only thing the investigator added was that when doctors turned Colin's head left and right after his death, the blood kept pouring out.' Elena Adams, ex-wife of author Colin Adams, at the Kosmos Hotel in Moscow, where the travel writer died. Mrs Adams fears a cover-up may be underway to protect the reputation of the Kosmos hotel . Earlier, this month the police decided against any legal action against barman Andrei Okhotin, who was initially detained.  'Suspicions about him have all been dropped, ' said Mr Adams. Further, the Russian authorities insisted that the writer died from a heart attack and there was no need to open a murder investigation surrounding his death. After seeking legal advice in Russia, the family abandoned plans for a Moscow cremation and sent the body back to Britain to check the results of the Russian autopsy. 'We were told that Colin really died from a serious  heart attack but that this was highly likely to have been caused by his head wounds,' said Elena. 'So the question is how he got these wounds. Did he fall down or did somebody attack him leading to his death? This is what the British doctors cannot tell us.' The British autopsy, the full results of which will go to an inquest in Britain, found that it would be surprising if he got both head wounds from a fall, it is understood. 'If he was assaulted and this led to his death, it could be manslaughter,"" said the victim's son.There was another deep shock for the family. 'The second autopsy revealed one of Colin's kidneys was taken out in Russia. I am not sure why and if they had any right to do so,' said Elena. Other mysteries remain. One Russian suggestion fed to the local media, but not officially confirmed by police, is that after midnight  Mr Adams had climbed onto the bar and fallen, apparently the worse for drink. Yet Elena and several Russian friends suggest that such behaviour was entirely out of character, and that he was not a heavy drinker though enjoying the occasional beer. The hotel has admitted that the 70 year old man did not buy drinks at the bar before the episode happened. Attempts by the family to view CCTV footage of the incident and eye-witness statements taken by police are getting nowhere, despite the involvement of the British Embassy. Next, while he evidently received the serious injuries at the hotel bar, rather than summon medical help, there is evidence that Mr Adams was carried by security hotel men to his room where he was later found to be dead. 'I am very worried that they say it was just an accident, not a murder, because nobody wants it to be a murder, neither the hotel, nor the police, maybe even for some political reasons because it could disrupt relations,' said Elena. Having visited the Moscow bar, she insisted: 'It is not possible to get such injuries when you just fall down. 'And I never ever saw him badly drunk. He could drink a pint of  but always controlled himself. 'He was a true gentleman. I can't imagine him starting a fight, especially in a public place like hotel. He was a very tall and strong man, and surely he would not let anybody abuse him. 'If this happened he would have replied with something strong and maybe rude in return, but no fighting, no way.' Another intriguing question is why Mr Adams was in Moscow. He returned to it year after year on regular trips to the Russian capital. Could he have, perhaps unwittingly, crossed somebody? One theory is that he was writing a travel book.  Another suggestion from a Moscow cafe owner that he often frequented was that he enjoyed the company of younger Russian women who he sometimes entertained to meals. 'Colin had a passion for Russia. He liked its cool climate and the people,' said Elena, who did not think he was romantically involved in Russia or had business dealings. Taxi driver Yuri Novikov, 52, said he had known Mr Adams for around 14 years since his first visit to Moscow. 'I was  the person who knew him best,' he said, explaining they shared a drink together on the eve of his death. 'Both of us were ex-army men. I served in the Soviet special forces in the Caucasus. For some reason Colin didn't talk about his military career. 'I don't know if was involved in business as well as writing, he never told me, I only know he liked to collect impressions about places. 'Colin was a cheerful and curious person. He liked Russia, and was interested in understanding Russian people. I am not exactly sure of the purposes of his previous visits here, but he came twice a year, every spring and every autumn, and stayed for a couple of weeks.' A lover of the beauty of the Welsh mountains, it seems, incongruously, that the bleak Moscow cityscape also held attractions for him. 'He  was very constant about the places he liked. He kept coming back to the same hotel and bars, even the same pond and  park.' But the driver was always left wondering: Why? At the final meeting, Mr Novikov took a picture of the author who had a strange request for him. 'He  was very keen in seeing the cheapest entertainment places where the rougher kind of Muscovites and guest workers were staying,' he said. 'I don't know why he wanted this and I didn't take him, explaining it may not be safe.' The driver is adamant that Mr Adams - a former army physical training instructor - would not have got into a fight. 'I never saw him badly drunk. Not a single time,' he said. 'He was never was aggressive, impatient or anything like this towards me or any other people I saw him with. He was tall, well over six foot, a gentle giant.' Hotel deputy director Andrey Chernyshov said it was up to police to determine what had happened. 'It is not clear at all why Mr Adams came down to this bar at 1 am,' he said. Moscow police said there was no evidence to open a criminal investigation.","Ex-wife believes police might be trying to protect reputation of hotel .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:00 AM on 3rd February 2012 . Malaria is killing almost twice as many people around the world than was previously thought, a study has shown. More than 40 per cent of the victims are older children and adults, challenging the belief that the vast majority of deaths occur among the under-fives. The infectious disease claimed 1.2 million lives worldwide in 2010, according to the new research. A mosquito feeding on human blood: Malaria is a disease caused by parasites transmitted by infected mosquitoes . This is nearly twice the number cited in a report from the World Health Organisation (WHO) published last year. The scientists, led by Dr Christopher Murray, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, US, analysed all available data on malaria mortality from 1980 to 2010. Their findings, published in The Lancet medical journal, showed consistently higher death tolls than those in the 2011 World Malaria Report. For children younger than five in Africa, death estimates were 1.3 times higher. For children and adults in Africa they were 8.1 times higher, and for individuals of all ages outside Africa they were 1.8 times higher. Worldwide, 433,000 more people over the age of five had been killed by malaria than WHO estimates suggested. 'You learn in medical school that people exposed to malaria as children develop immunity and rarely die from malaria as adults,' said Dr Murray. 'What we have found in hospital records, death records, surveys and other sources shows that just is not the case.' The better news was that after peaking in 2004 at 1.8 million, the number of fatal malaria cases had fallen each year. Between 2007 and 2010 they had seen an annual decline of more than  seven per cent. The trend was chiefly due to health initiatives driven by major aid organisations such as the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, said the researchers. 'We have seen a huge increase in both funding and in policy attention given to malaria over the past decade, and it's having a real impact,' said co-author Dr Alan Lopez, from the University of Queensland in Australia. 'Reliably demonstrating just how big an impact is important to drive further investments in malaria control programmes. This makes it even more critical for us to generate accurate estimates for all deaths, not just in young children and not just in sub-Saharan Africa.' With the larger number of deaths, the goal of reducing malaria mortality to zero by 2015 might be unrealistic, the researchers pointed out. They wrote: 'We estimated that if decreases from the peak year of 2004 continue, malaria mortality will decrease to less than 100,000 deaths only after 2020.'",U.S study found malaria death rate twice the number cited by World Health Organisation .

Stones from an eruption 3,500 years ago in Greece hint that magma beneath the ground had been running into the magma chamber for 100 years before a huge eruption. The 'warning' was no help to the Bronze Age civilisation surrounding Santorini -  but seismologists could now use it to monitor supervolcanoes for imminent eruptions. Mount Etna erupting in 2007: Researchers believe that volcanoes may give us a detectable 'sign' that they're going to erupt - and we could use the technique to see which 'dormant' volcanoes are a danger . The Santorini volcano in the Greek Islands lay dormant for 18,000 years before an enormous eruption 3,500 years ago, said New Scientist. The eruption may have contributed to the collapse of the Minoan civilisation, a Bronze Age civilisation in Crete. Magma began flooding into the magma chamber 100 years before the eruption. If this is a process that is repeated in most volcanic eruptions, it's one that could be detected by geologists. Seismic monitoring could, in theory, spot signs that magma is moving into the magma chamber - and we could even test 'dormant' supervolcanoes such as Yellowstone for signs of activity. Minoan fleet in battle, c. 1500 BC: The eruption at Santorini happened after the volcano had been dormant for 18,000 years and may have been partially responsible for the collapse of the Minoan civilisation . View of the volcano in Santorini, Greece: Rocks from the volcano hint that magma had been flooding the magma chamber for 100 years before the eruption . Most volcanic eruptions are preceded by signs that the mountain could erupt. Authorities rely on these for a few days' or months' warning to evacuate the area. But if there were signs years or even decades before, authorities could prevent catastrophe. Timothy Druitt of Blaise Pascal University in Clermont-Ferrand, France, says that the crystals in the rocks around the Santorini volcano have a structure that only makes sense if magma had been entering the chamber for a century.","Magma runs into magma chamber for decades .

They are the words everyone dreads hearing from their doctor ... and the fact they are delivered over the phone can only compound the trauma. Yet last night it emerged that many patients are being told they have cancer in a phone call rather than a face-to-face meeting. It seems that the traditional practice of a doctor breaking the news in person is becoming a thing of the past. Queen's Hospital, part of the Burton Hospitals Foundation NHS Trust. Staff have been reminded that telling a patient they have cancer on the phone is 'inappropriate' Stephen Coupe, founder of Cancer . Relief UK, said the development was outrageous. ‘It is a scandal that so . many cancer patients are being given their diagnosis in this way,’ he . added. ‘We have had many calls from families who are upset about this.’ Yesterday, staff at one NHS trust were officially rebuked for telling patients they had cancer over the phone. Jim Morrison, chairman of Burton . Hospitals in Staffordshire, told the trust’s directors he had been . shocked such a warning was needed. But on internet support forums, dozens of cancer patients said the same thing had happened to them. The phone call incident was the subject of one of 82 complaints made to the trust between October and December 2011 (posed) One man said he had complained after his wife was given the news in this way. ‘She was on her own in the house – no . one else with her,’ he wrote on the Macmillan Cancer Support forum. ‘It . just beggars belief – do they not do this in training to be a doctor, . how to break bad news to patients?’ Dozens of patients then replied to his . message, saying they had had the same experience. They said being given . the news by phone was ‘pitiful’. Incredibly, one man said his wife had been told to pass him the message that he had cancer by a doctor who called them at home. Another woman spoke of the agony of . being at home with her two-year-old daughter when she was told that she . had an aggressive form of  skin cancer. ‘When she went off the phone, I just . broke down in tears,’ she wrote. ‘I had to phone my dad to come and get . my daughter.’ A second woman said being told of her cancer over the . phone was  the worst moment of her whole life. ‘She added: ‘I spent four hours crying alone until my husband came home.’ Many said telling patients they had . cancer over the phone was insensitive and should be banned. ‘It’s not . like you are phoning to see if you’ve passed your GCSEs,’ one said. ‘I wonder how someone who is mentally fragile, already depressed, vulnerable and alone would cope.’ One patient said he was shocked when a . doctor told him over the phone that ‘it would be a miracle if he didn’t . have cancer’. At this point, he said, they had not even received the . results of his biopsy. One woman said she ‘always knew this . wouldn’t be an easy journey’ but said it had been made much more . difficult by the fact that no one had spoken to her face to face. A spokesman for Macmillan said a . cancer diagnosis was the most devastating news that can be received from . a doctor and that the news should always be given face to face to . ensure the patient is properly supported.

"By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 9:41 AM on 31st January 2012 . Four huge volcanic eruptions triggered a 'Little Ice Age' that cooled earth for hundreds of years until the late 19th century, say scientists. The period of cooling led to famous events such as people ice skating on the River Thames. A study at the University of Colorado analysed sediment cores, vegetation and ice, and revealed that four massive tropical volcanic eruptions between 1275 and 1300AD triggered the period of cooling. Scientist Gifford collects vegetation samples on Baffin Island. The scientists analysed sediment, vegetation and ice samples to make their conclusions . The scientists also used powerful computer climate modelling to confirm their results. ‘This is the first time anyone has clearly identified the specific onset of the cold times marking the start of the Little Ice Age,’ says lead author Gifford Miller of the University of Colorado at Boulder. ‘We also have provided an understandable climate feedback system that explains how this cold period could be sustained for a long period of time.' 'If the climate system is hit again and again by cold conditions over a relatively short period -in this case, from volcanic eruptions - there appears to be a cumulative cooling effect.’ A chromolithograph Chrismas card from 1865 showing the frozen Thames: Scientists now believe that the prolonged period of cooling was caused by four tropical volcanic eruptions . ‘Our simulations showed that the volcanic eruptions may have had a profound cooling effect,’ says NCAR scientist Bette Otto-Bliesner, a co-author of the study. ‘The eruptions could have triggered a chain reaction, affecting sea ice and ocean currents in a way that lowered temperatures for centuries.’The study appears this week in Geophysical Research Letters. Scientific estimates regarding the onset of the Little Ice Age range from the 13th century to the 16th century. Although the cooling temperatures may have affected places as far away as South America and China, they were particularly evident in northern Europe. Advancing glaciers in mountain valleys destroyed towns, and paintings from the period depict people ice-skating on the River Thames in London and canals in the Netherlands, places that were ice-free before and after the Little Ice Age.‘The dominant way scientists have defined the Little Ice Age is by the expansion of big valley glaciers in the Alps and in Norway,’ says Miller, a fellow at CU’s Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research. ‘But the time in which European glaciers advanced far enough to demolish villages would have been long after the onset of the cold period.’Miller and his colleagues radiocarbon-dated roughly 150 samples of dead plant material with roots intact, collected from beneath receding margins of ice caps on Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic. They found a large cluster of ‘kill dates’ between 1275 and 1300 A.D., indicating the plants had been frozen and engulfed by ice during a relatively sudden event. The team saw a second spike in plant kill dates at about 1450 A.D., indicating the quick onset of a second major cooling event.Tthe researchers also analysed sediment cores from a glacial lake linked to the 367-square-mile Langjökull ice cap in the central highlands of Iceland that reaches nearly a mile high. The annual layers in the cores -- which can be reliably dated by using deposits from known historic volcanic eruptions on Iceland going back more than 1,000 years -- suddenly became thicker in the late 13th century and again in the 15th century due to increased erosion caused by the expansion of the ice cap as the climate cooled.‘That showed us the signal we got from Baffin Island was not just a local signal, it was a North Atlantic signal,’ Miller says. ‘This gave us a great deal more confidence that there was a major perturbation to the Northern Hemisphere climate near the end of the 13th century.’The team used the Community Climate System Model to simulate the effects of volcanic cooling on Arctic sea ice extent and mass. T . The model, which simulated various sea ice conditions from about 1150 to 1700 A.D., showed several large, closely spaced eruptions could have cooled the Northern Hemisphere enough to trigger the expansion of Arctic sea ice.The model showed that sustained cooling from volcanoes would have sent some of the expanding Arctic sea ice down along the eastern coast of Greenland until it eventually melted in the North Atlantic. Since sea ice contains almost no salt, when it melted the surface water became less dense, preventing it from mixing with deeper North Atlantic water. This weakened heat going back to the Arctic and created a self-sustaining cycle that sustained the sea ice long after the effects of the volcanic aerosols subsided, according to the simulations.","Scientists analysed sediment and vegetation to confirm start of 'Little Ice Age'

"By . Tim Shipman . Last updated at 10:08 AM on 26th January 2012 . Independence plans: Alex Salmond, pictured at a Scottish storytelling centre on the 253rd anniversary of the birth of Robert Burns, outlined his plans for a referendum in 2014 . Alex Salmond unveiled his plans for a referendum on Scottish independence yesterday – publishing a question which critics said was ‘loaded’ and designed to destroy the Union. Scotland’s First Minister outlined a timetable which could see an end to the 300-year Union of England and Scotland by 2016. But his plans immediately caused controversy since they appeared designed to subvert the usual democratic safeguards over referendums – or to spark a row with London which would also boost the Scottish National Party’s chances of a Yes vote. Mr Salmond said Scottish voters would go to the polls in 2014 – the 700th anniversary of the Scottish victory over the English at the Battle of Bannockburn. They would be asked: ‘Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country?’ He said he would allow 16 and 17 year olds to vote, a proposal that contravenes UK election law and is designed to boost support from pro-independence teenagers. The SNP leader also said that if the Scottish public demands it, he is prepared to sanction a second question on the ballot paper on whether Scotland wants beefed up devolution, known as ‘devo max’. Most controversially, Mr Salmond attempted to bypass the usual procedure for holding a referendum in which the Electoral Commission, which helps to run the vote, has to sanction the question as fair. Mr Salmond made clear that he only regards the watchdog’s role as consultative rather than binding, allowing him alone to decide how the question is ultimately phrased. He told Scottish MPs the question that would be put to voters would be ‘short, straightforward and clear’. Mr Salmond said: ‘Independence, in essence, is based on a simple idea: the people who care most about Scotland, that is the people who live, work and bring up their families in Scotland, should be the ones taking the decisions about our nation’s future.’ In the big chair: First Minister Alex Salmond, speaking with schoolchildren yesterday, said he wants to extend the right to vote in an independence referendum to 16 and 17-year-olds . A simple question: Alex Salmond told MSPs he wants the referendum question to be: 'Do you agree your country should be independent?' But former Labour Chancellor Alistair . Darling said: ‘The question is loaded. He is inviting people to endorse . the separation of a successful independent nation. He is not asking if . you want to remain part of the United Kingdom, which I would prefer. ‘It is asking for trouble and if he . tries to push through unfair wording someone will go to court. It’s . typical of Salmond who wants to call the shots on the rules, the . conduct, the wording and ultimately what the result means.’ Ministers viewed the wording of the . question as unfair and liable to encourage a Yes vote – speculating that . Mr Salmond wants to pick a fight. One Westminster source said: ‘This is . all about Salmond turning around and saying: “Look at all those dreadful . people in London trying to tell us what to do.”’ A Downing Street official added: ‘Alex . Salmond doesn’t have the power to set out the question. These are his . proposals and they will feed into our consultation. But he doesn’t have . the power to legally set up a referendum. ‘The Electoral Commission should play . their usual role in the referendum and that means scrutinising the . question. They are officially part of the process. That is mentioned in . our own consultation document.’ Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said . the Government would block any bid to introduce a devo max question. Consultation document: Alex Salmond holds up a copy of 'Your Scotland, Your Referendum' setting out the SNPs' roadmap to independence . England will be better without us: Mr Salmond speaking during the Hugo Young Lecture at King's Place, London, on Tuesday night . ‘Any attempt to pass legislation for . either an independence or devo max referendum would be outside the . existing powers of the Scottish Parliament and liable to legal . challenge,’ he said. ‘We have made it clear that we think the Scottish . Government would lose such a challenge.’ Mr Salmond also faced ridicule . yesterday after admitting that the Bank of England would have to bail . out an independent Scotland if it got into financial trouble. He conceded that the final say on . financial policy would be left with the Bank, which would act as lender . of last resort if an independent Scotland were to retain the pound.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:15 AM on 6th February 2012 . Michele Bachmann’s former high school is under fire for a spate of suicides by gay and lesbian students that allegedly followed anti-homosexual school policy. A recent Rolling Stone article details the rampant homophobia in the Anoka-Hennepin School District- from which Ms Bachmann graduated- and how school administrators encouraged teachers to steer clear of conversations about sexuality with students. The issue has come to light after a scary amount of teen suicides- nine in the past two years- have occurred in the school district, many of whom were either homosexual or thought to be by their peers. Rising star: Michele Bachmann, who ran a failed bid for the presidency, is known for her ultra-conservative religious views that interpret homosexuality very harshly . Many more have attempted to take their own lives leading state public health officials to slap a 'suicide contagion area' label on the region because of the high levels. While Michele Bachmann rose to the national political stage last year because of her failed bid for the presidency, another anti-homosexual campaigner named Barb Anderson has taken charge of the ultra-conservative agenda in the area's schools. Ms Anderson is the one who first introduced and authored the so-called 'No Homo Promo' policy which told teachers in the district to avoid any talk of homosexuality within the schools. The idea that homosexuality is 'wrong' and the belief that it is a 'sinful choice' is something that essentially became a school rule as students perceived their teacher's silence as a admission of fault and blame. Loss: Samantha Johnson, left, was one of the . first students in the Anoka-Hennepin district to commit suicide in 2009, . while 15-year-old Justin Aaberg, right, hanged himself in his bedroom . in 2010 . 'They're made to feel ashamed of who they are. They're bullied. And there's no one to stand up for them, because teachers are afraid of being fired,' Anoka Middle School for the Arts teacher Jefferson Fietek told Rolling Stone. 'LGBTQ students don't feel safe at school,' he continued. At least four of those who committed suicide were openly gay or, at least, perceived to be gay by classmates, and many were reportedly bullied. Anoka High School in Minnesota, which is the alma mater of Michele Bachmann, is at the heart of a anti-gay-bullying debate because of their discriminatory policies . While it is impossible to prove why . these youngsters took their own lives, many are drawing a link between . their bullying and the anti-gay rhetoric sweeping through school . districts in the state. One . of the most publicized cases was that of Justin Aaberg, an openly gay 15 . year old who hanged himself weeks after finishing his freshman year at . Anoka High School. His suicide was the school district's sixth in a year's time. Since his death, Justin's . mother Tammy has been spoken publicly about the worry she had for her son's . safety as an openly gay teen and battled to get the school district to . change its thinking on anti-gay bullying. Pact: Minnesota school girls from a different . district, Haylee Fentress, left, and Paige Moravetz, right, carried out a . suicide pact in April because they said they were being bullied . Waste: Lance Lundsten, a Jefferson High School . student, left,  who was openly gay on his Facebook page, took an . overdose and later died in hospital in March, while Thomas John 'TJ' Hayes, right, committed suicide in 2009 . Tragic: The latest case in the district was of 14-year-old Jordan Yenor (left) who killed himself in May 2011, and he was preceded by Aaron Jurek, (right), a student at Blaine High School who died in 2009 . The original article, One Town's War on Gay Teens, can be read in this week's issue of Rolling Stone magazine . She also delivered a petition with over 140,000 signatures to Bachmann demanding she denounce the gay-bullying that was common in the area. She never directly received a response but heard through the grapevine that Bachmann responded vaguely, saying 'bullying is wrong' and 'all human lives have undeniable value' but never directly mentioning homosexuality. Anoka-Hennepin is currently under federal investigation for infringing civil rights because it refused to add lessons promoting homosexuality to the curriculum. Several . LGBT students are also suing the district claiming to have been ignored by . staff after complaining of being harassed physically and verbally for . long periods of time. One . of the plaintiffs dropped out of school, later attempting suicide while . another claims to have been called a 'faggot' in the hallway while a . teacher who witnessed the attack did nothing, according to the suit. School employees could not teach that . homosexuality was a 'normal, valid lifestyle.' The policy was later . changed to require staff to remain neutral on the subject, but only if . it should come up in class. Teachers were instructed to say that, if they witnessed verbal bullying of a student perceived to be gay, 'In this school we are required to welcome all people and to make them feel safe' but they were told not to show 'personal support for GLBT people'. Both . policies were influenced by two religious groups - and big Bachmann . supporters -  the Minnesota Family Council (MFC) and The Parents Action . League, which also lobbied to put discredited 'reparative therapy' materials into schools, according to the website.","Nine teens killed themselves over a two year span in Bachmann's district .

The trendy postcode where shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper and her husband Ed Balls have their home is named Britain’s worst for burglaries. It is one of six London postcodes on the list. Stoke Newington has in recent years developed a reputation as an up and coming area thanks in part to its regular organic farmers’ market and car boot fairs devoted to vintage goods. It has a hugely diverse population, including large Asian, Irish, Turkish, Jewish and Afro-Caribbean communities. The research was based on quotes sought by more than three million consumers using the moneysupermarket.com price comparison website.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:02 AM on 6th February 2012 . Looking sad and disillusioned, Yankees boss Brian Cashman visited his ex-wife at their $3.7million Darien mansion on the weekend as a trail of shocking emails emerged, alleging he got his accused stalker pregnant and forced her to have an abortion. But Cashman spent less than a minute in the house where his ex-wife has been holed up, reports the New York Post. Scruffily dressed and with dark rings under his eyes from lack of sleep, the pressure was clearly showing. Cashman moved out of the family home when the claims first surfaced. Louise Neathway, 36, who has been charged with stalking and harassing the 44-year-old general manager, even attached an ultrasound scan of their alleged unborn to one of the messages. The trove of emails sent to Cashman . and his lawyer by Neathway, who claims she had an affair with the . father-of-two and allegedly blackmailed him for  $6,000, were obtained by the New York Daily News. A sad state of affairs: Looking tired and unhappy, Brian Cashman drives away from his house in Norwalk, Connecticut on Saturday . Louise Neathway, pictured right in court, claimed that Yankess boss . Brian Cashman, left, got her pregnant and made her have an abortion . 'What Brian Cashman has done to me is . both incomprehensible and unforgivable,' Neathway reportedly wrote in an email . sent with the scan on January 29. 'I am going to the press and informaing [sic] them of the preganacy [sic] and the abortion. And everything else,' she writes typo littered message, reports the Daily News. 'So you can have a little gloat at my agony here is my ultra sound picture. . . I guess its ok for me to just push this aside right? Men!!!' Neathway, in a separate email sent a day later, threatened to make Cashman’s life hell unless he paid for her 'abortion'. She also warned that any threats against her would backfire claiming she worked for British intelligence agency MI6. Pregnancy scare: Neathway emailed Cashman a photo of an ultrasound, shown but who's authenticity is not confirmed, telling him to pay for her 'abortion' or she would continue to torment him . Prior accusations: Cashman is not the first man to accuse her of stalking and making threats . 'I will not tolerate threats by any means, of a criminal nature, as that will bite Brian in the backside and probably will be the biggest personal mistake of his life,' wrote the mother-of-one, reports the Daily News. His wife Mary, 42, filed for divorce a . day after Neathway faced her charges in court on Thursday claiming to have had an . affair with the father-of-two. Cashman is the latest in a line of men . who claim Neathway has tormented them with death threats, phone hacking . and lies about miscarriages and abortions, court records and former . friends claim, according to the Post. Yankees boss Brian Cashman's wife has filed for a divorce after he was publicly accused of the affair with Neathway . He emerged in public on Saturday for the first time since his wife submitted the divorce papers after the humiliating claims he had an affair with his accused 'crazed stalker'. Scruffily dressed, he visited the . family’s $3.7 million Darien mansion where his wife has been living . apart in the wake of the allegations - but he spent less than a minute . inside, reports the New York Post. Mrs Cashman had said the marriage had 'broken down irretrievably'. She is seeking permanent alimony, half of their property and joint custody of their two children, reports the New York Post. Extra threat: Neathway warned Cashman in her last email that any threats against her would backfire claiming she worked for British intelligence agency MI6 . Mrs Cashman, who endured the humiliation of an affair her husband had back in 2009, has been living apart from him in the family home with her daughter and son, sources told the Post. British native Neathway, also known as Louise Meanwell, was arrested on Wednesday and is facing charges of grand larceny, stalking and harassment. On Thursday prosecutors said Neathway harassed Cashman with hundreds of text messages, and demanded he give her $15,000 to pay for an unspecified medical procedure. She allegedly threatened to contact the press and his family with claims that would hurt his personal relationships and professional standing, according to a court complaint. Cashman made two payments, one for $4,000 and another for $2,000. In a series of shocking emails to Cashman, Louise Neathway, 36, pictured in court on Thursday, reportedly threatened to tell the world he got her pregnant . He even tried to get rid of his alleged mistress by urging her mother to have her committed, sources told the Daily News. He contacted Caroline Meanwell last week and told her that her daughter was mentally unstable and 'needs help', the sources said. The call led to a meeting between Meanwell, Cashman and his lawyer. 'He told the mother she needed help,' one of the sources told the Daily News. 'He suggested to her that she try to have her committed' In a meeting on January 27, Cashman and Meanwell placed a conference call to Louise’s Manhattan psychiatrist, Charlotte Murphy, who agreed with Cashman, sources told the Post said. 'Murphy agreed that Louise was dangerous and violent, and that it was a serious situation. She said to call 911,' a  source told the Post. Second sting: Cashman's wife has since filed for divorce requesting joint custody of their two children and share in their $3.7 million Darien mansion with this latest sting being his second affair during their marriage . Meanwell made the call which eventually led to her daughter's arrest. The Daily News also obtained a reference letter Cashman wrote for Neathway on Yankees letterhead. In . the letter dated July 15, 2011, Cashman said that he has known her for . six years through charity work and describes her as 'tireless' contributor who has the 'respect and admiration' of her colleagues. In court Neathway's lawyers said Mr Cashman was 'a . married man having an inappropriate relationship' with Neathway, a . medical sales worker, and he . turned on her when it 'ended badly' Neathway’s lawyers claim their client is the real victim of a romance that . began in April and 'ended badly.' She . is also reported by the Post to have claimed to several friends that . she had a year long affair with Cashman which she ended after he did not . fulfill a promise to leave his wife. Mr Cashman claims he was stalked and blackmailed into handing over $6,000 to Louise Neathway . Neathway has a criminal history of harassment and trespassing going back to 1988 and spanning three states. She has allegedly been harassing her ex-husband Jason Bump, their daughter and a long line of boyfriends she’s had since her marriage broke up, reports the Post. 'She’s a very dangerous person. She’s a psychopath, in my estimation,' Mr Bump, told The Post. 'There’s currently an order of protection for myself, my daughter, my wife and my mother' against her. 'She has not seen our daughter in a few years, and she’s not allowed to contact her at all,' he said reports the Post. Cashman is the latest in a line of men who claim Neathway has tormented them with death threats, phone hacking and lies about miscarriages and abortions, court records and former friends claim, according to the Post. In 2010 a former lover, who works on Wall Street, told the police that 'she has made many threatening statements aimed at me and has been e-mailing and phoning me constantly. Cashman is the latest in the line of men who claim Neathway has tormented them with death threats, phone hacking and lies about miscarriages . 'She’s also begun waiting outside my apartment in the East Village,' court records said according to the Post. 'I am fearful for my safety and have no idea what this woman is capable of. As of this morning, she has hacked into my personal e-mail account and my Facebook account, deleting all my e-mails. I am VERY scared of her.' he ex-fling said. Neathway also has two open upstate warrants for harassment, and is on probation for stalking in New Jersey, reports the Daily News. Mrs Cashman served her husband with divorce papers on January 31, the day before Neathway was arrested, reports the Post. The documents were filed in court on Friday. She previously stood by her husband as he was romantically linked to a Westchester mother-of-two, Kim Brennan.

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 10:03 PM on 5th February 2012 . Egypt has referred 43 NGO workers, including 19 Americans, to trial before a criminal court for allegedly using illegal foreign funds to foment unrest. Among the Americans sent to trial is Sam LaHood, the head of the Egypt office of the Washington-based International Republican Institute and the son of U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. The decision made today marked a sharp escalation of the dispute between Cairo and Washington over Egypt's crackdown on U.S.-funded groups promoting democracy and human rights. Facing trial in Egypt: Sam Lahood (left) standing with his father, Transportation Secretary Ray Lahood (right) in Washington in 2009 . The two countries have been close allies for more than three decades, but the campaign against the organisations has angered Washington, and jeopardised the $1.5 billion in aid Egypt is set to receive from the U.S. this year. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton yesterday warned Egypt's foreign minister that failure to resolve the dispute may lead to the loss of American aid. The Egyptian minister, Mohammed Amr, responded today by saying the government cannot interfere in the work of the judiciary. ‘We . are doing our best to contain this but we cannot actually exercise any . influence on the investigating judges right now when it comes to the . investigation,’ Amr told reporters at a security conference in Munich, . Germany. Also among those referred to trial are five Serbs, two Germans and three non-Egyptian Arab nationals. Warning: Hillary Clinton has warned Egypt's foreign minister that failure to resolve the dispute may lead to the loss of American aid . All 43 have been banned from leaving the country. A date has yet to be set for the start of the trial. The Egyptian investigation into the . work of NGOs in the country is closely linked to the political turmoil . that has engulfed the nation since the ouster nearly a year ago of Hosni . Mubarak, a close U.S. ally who ruled Egypt for nearly 30 years. The . generals who took power after Mubarak's fall have accused 'foreign . hands' of being behind protests against their rule and frequently depict . the protesters as receiving funds from abroad in a plot to destabilise . the country. Those . allegations have cost the youth activists that spearheaded Mubarak's . ouster support among a wider public that is sensitive to allegations of . foreign meddling and which sees a conspiracy to destabilise Egypt in . nearly every move by a foreign nation. But . todays decision to refer the 43 to trial raises questions about the . Egyptian military's motive to allow the issue to escalate so much that . the valuable $1.3 billion it gets annually be placed in jeopardy. Washington also is set to give Egypt $250 million in economic aid this year. Continuing protests: Protesters chant anti-government slogans during a protest condemning the death of soccer fans at Port Said stadium, near the Interior Ministry in Cairo this month . The . U.S. assistance has allowed the Egyptian military to replace its . relatively antiquated Soviet-era weaponry with modern and sophisticated . arms, ranging from fighter-bombers and transport aircraft to tanks and . personnel carriers. The aid is closely but informally linked to Egypt's continued adherence to its 1979 peace treaty with Israel, Washington's closest Middle East ally. Already, Egyptian authorities are preventing at least six Americans — including LaHood — and four Europeans from leaving the country, citing a probe opened last month when heavily armed security forces raided the offices of 17 pro-democracy and rights groups. Egyptian officials have defended the raid as part of a legitimate investigation into the groups' work and funding. Also today, security officials said Mubarak, 83, would shortly be moved to a prison for the first time since his arrest last April.

Security officials said Mubarak (pictured being wheeled into a courtroom last September) would shortly be moved to a prison for the first time since his arrest last April .

The officials also said that around 50 former regime insiders held at Tora would be dispersed to five different jails in the greater Cairo area within the next 48 hours. They include Mubarak's two sons, businessman Alaa and one-time heir apparent Gamal, two former prime ministers and the former speakers of parliament's two chambers. The decision to move Mubarak and spread the regime officials appeared to be a concession by the military to pro-reform activists who complain that the ruling generals led by Mubarak's defense minister for 20 years were treating the ousted leader with reverence and turning a blind eye to former regime officials clustered in Tora to use supporters to undermine security.","Sam LaHood, son of Ray LaHood, is among the Americans facing trial .

Facebook will float on the stock exchange next year in a share offering which could raise as much as £63billion, it has been claimed. If it goes ahead it will be the biggest consumer technology public offering in history. Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, said in an interview that he expects the company to be listed on the stock exchange in the 'first half of next year'. Floatation? If Facebook, founded by Mark Zuckerberg, was to go public it could raise £63bn . The social networking site was co-founded by Mark Zuckerberg, 27, when he was at Harvard University seven years ago. Mr Hoffman is a major investor in the site and has significant holdings in a number of other web companies. As a private company, Facebook is limited to having just 500 shareholders. The U.S. regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has put them under pressure to disclose how many people have a stake in the company. They have to make a declaration by next April and analysts have said it would be the perfect time to go public. Analysts believe that Facebook could be given a valuation of as much as $100bn - or £63bn - if they to announced a floatation. Mr Hoffman told the Sunday Telegraph he believes the company will go public as a means to raise capital. Claims: Reid Hoffman, who holds a significant stake in Facebook, suggested the company could announced a floatation in the first half of next year . He said: 'I suspect that Mark (Zuckerberg) will choose to go public because the . company has to put in a lot of financial work in order to make the . necessary filings and so he might as well make sure he benefits . employees and ultimately the company from the level of work that’s . already involved. 'Going public would benefit Facebook in lots of ways - namely having . public currency to do acquisitions. 'So Mark (Zuckerberg) might as well . get the benefit as well as the cost.' Mr Zuckerberg suggested in an interview last month that if Facebook went public it would be possible to reward staff with 'equity and options'.

"By . Glen Owen . Last updated at 1:21 AM on 5th February 2012 . The rift in the Liberal Democrats over the prosecution of former Energy Secretary Chris Huhne was laid bare last night as his ex-wife Vicky Pryce welcomed ‘Camp Vicky’ guests to a party held annually at the couple’s home. The party, which was co-hosted by the couple until their split in 2010, highlighted how their mutual friends have been forced to choose which ‘camp’ to join – an issue of divided loyalties that will be thrown into sharp relief by the upcoming court case. Greek-born Miss Pryce, 57, shrugged off her worries to welcome high-profile allies to her £2.5 million townhouse in Clapham, South  London. Divided: The party came a day after Miss Pryce (left) and Mr Huhne (right) were charged with perverting the course of justice . The party came just a day after Mr Huhne, 57, and Miss Pryce were both charged with perverting the course of justice over claims that he had used her name to escape speeding penalty points.  He strongly denies the charges. More than 100 guests had received invites with their Christmas cards to the annual ‘post-Davos’ celebration. Miss Pryce, a high-flying economist, has numerous friends who attend the meeting of the political and business elite in the Swiss resort at the end of January. Most of the couple’s mutual friends sided with Miss Pryce in the immediate aftermath of the split because they felt she had been badly treated by Mr Huhne when he left her for his assistant Carina Trimingham, 45. Allies: Nick Clegg's wife Miriam (left) offered support to Miss Pryce while Gus O’Donnell (right) is also supporting Huhne's ex-wife . However, Miss Pryce’s subsequent actions, . including making claims about the speeding offence, have reportedly led . some of them to moderate their support. At last year’s party, the ‘Camp Vicky’ contingent was out in force, including former Cabinet Secretary Gus O’Donnell, a former Treasury colleague of Miss Pryce; Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott; Left-wing journalist Polly Toynbee; constitutional expert Vernon Bogdanor and Labour MP Denis MacShane. Miss Pryce can also count on the support of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg’s wife, Miriam, who telephoned her after the prosecution was announced on Friday to tell her: ‘If you need somewhere to stay, if the kids need support, we’re here.’ Points: How the Huhne speeding case has been reported . Business Secretary Vince Cable and Mr Huhne’s replacement as Energy Secretary, Ed Davey, are also regarded as supporters. ‘Camp . Chris’ is less colourful and less numerous – reflecting the former . Cabinet Minister’s reputation for having few friends in politics. Apart from Ms Trimingham, 57, Mr Huhne can count on Lib Dem president and ally Tim Farron, who this weekend described him as ‘the grit in the oyster’ in the Coalition. Mr Farron said: ‘The reason why he was on the negotiating team at the formation of the Coalition, I was told by someone who shall remain unnamed, was because “Chris Huhne is a thug” and that he is someone who could go into the room and just negotiate a position and get the best possible outcome. ‘I hope he’ll be proved innocent. I hope he comes back very quickly.’ Mr Huhne can also rely on Home Office Minister Lynne Featherstone – who chaired his leadership campaign in 2007 – Pensions Minister Steve Webb and controversial Portsmouth MP Mike Hancock. Mr Huhne is the first Cabinet  Minister in history to be forced from office by a criminal prosecution. Miss Pryce has not indicated how she intends to plead in the case. If she admits the charge, she could be called to give evidence against Mr Huhne. If she decides to plead not guilty, she will have to stand next to him in the dock. The couple, who raised three children and two stepchildren during their 27-year marriage, are due to appear in court on February 16.","Friends of the couple have been forced to take sides .

Pledge: Eric Pickles is attempting to shame councils into restoring weekly bin collections . Millions of homes are to have their weekly bin collections restored, Eric Pickles will pledge today. The Local Government Secretary will reveal more than 70 councils intend to use a £250million government fund to end unpopular fortnightly schemes. Mr Pickles is attempting to shame what he will call the ‘town hall Talibin’ into restoring weekly collections, saying councils have ‘no excuse’ not to bring them back and voters should punish those which don’t. ‘Rubbish collections are the most visible service that people get for their £120 per month council tax,’ he will say. ‘Labour’s barmy bin rules have made putting out your rubbish more complicated than solving a Rubik’s cube. 'The public are fed up of all the bin dos and don’ts – they just want a simple service, which is why the Government is making sure councils offer a good weekly collection and make it easier to go green. 'We’ve called time on the town hall Talibin, and have ditched Labour’s policies of bin cuts, bin fines and bin taxes in the dustbin of history.’ Since Labour’s 1997 election victory, half of households – ten million covered by 180 local authorities – have lost their weekly collections. Instead, local authorities have been encouraged to collect household waste and recyclable rubbish on alternate weeks. However, homeowners have complained . the change has led to rises in pest populations, unpleasant smells from . waste left uncollected, and a plethora of bin fines and taxes imposed on . anyone breaking the rules. Those who overfill their bins or accidentally leave rubbish out on the wrong day risk penalties of up to £1,000. The Daily Mail has long campaigned to have weekly collections restored. Rubbish: Since Labour won in 1997 half have lost weekly bin collections - and the number of different types of bin has increased . Mr Pickles will argue today it is possible to increase recycling rates while also offering weekly collections of all rubbish. He will point to the example of Windsor and Maidenhead, which has increased recycling by 35 per cent by offering people incentives such as shopping vouchers and loyalty card points. Mr Pickles said councils could also use the new cash to introduce technology such as ‘mechanical biological treatment’ facilities, where rubbish is sorted into recyclable items and those that need to go to landfill. Even before the Government has formally opened the scheme, more than 70 councils have signalled their intention to restore weekly collections. The Local Government Secretary’s announcement follows a fierce battle between him and Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman, who had tried to ditch a Tory pledge to restore traditional weekly collections, which were first required by law 136 years ago. Even before the election, the Conservatives said they would provide funding for councils that abandoned fortnightly pick-ups. The Environment Department has argued that these had helped boost recycling rates and reduced the amount of refuse buried in landfill sites. Hilary Benn, Labour’s local government spokesman, said: ‘Local people are best placed to decide how rubbish is collected. ‘Sitting behind his desk in Whitehall, Eric Pickles should trust communities to do this rather than thinking that he knows better.’","Eric Pickles to shame 'town hall Talibin' into restoring weekly collections .

Britain's sporting heroes should wear the EU flag on their national team shirts under contentious plans passed by the European Parliament yesterday. The measures stipulate that the EU's blue and yellow flag should be worn by all our teams - including football, rugby, cricket and the British Olympic team. The EU flag should also be flown at major British sporting events such as the FA Cup Final, the Ashes series, Wimbledon and the British Grand Prix. Flag bearer: England star Wayne Rooney could be forced to wear the European stars on his England shirt... which could look like our mocked-up image, right . To be flown: Britain's sporting heroes should wear the EU flag on their national team shirts under plans passed by the European Parliament yesterday . Following an outcry, MEPs have acknowledged that the measure should not be compulsory and individual member states will be given the final say over whether to display the flag. The idea is contained in a report on 'The European Dimension In Sport' which was overwhelmingly approved by MEPs yesterday. The recommendations will now be considered by the European Commission. Tory MEPs have furiously fought the proposals arguing that they are the latest example of Brussels attempting to impose itself on Britain's way of life. The report suggests 'that the European flag should be flown at major international sports events held on the EU territory'. It adds that sports should 'consider the idea of having it displayed on the clothing of athletes from Member States, alongside with the national flags; underlines that it should be entirely voluntary and up to Member States and sports organisations to decide whether they will use the aforementioned options.' Argument: English demands to wear a poppy on shirts led to FIFA allowing this armband to be worn in November . The report also seeks to bar sports . agents from operating anywhere in the EU unless they pay taxes there, a . move likely to starve many top British sides of overseas talent, . especially in cricket and rugby. Brussels already has the power to fine organisations in certain circumstances for not flying the EU flag. Recently, . it emerged that the University of Northampton was fined more than . £56,000 for not displaying the EU logo to acknowledge it had received . funding from the European Regional Development Fund. Emma . McClarkin MEP, Conservative spokesman on culture, education and sport . in the European Parliament, said the proposal was 'outrageous and . unnecessary'. 'Sport has a . special place in my country, and our national teams form a key part of . our identities and heritage,' she told the parliament. 'The EU cannot impose an artificial European identity on us by forcing our athletes to wear its emblem.' Bright idea: Members of the European Parliament attend a debate . She . added: 'The report also calls for any agent representing a sportsperson . who plays in Europe to have their fiscal residence in the EU; despite . the fact that many players are not European and many sportspeople . themselves have their fiscal residence outside the EU. 'Taxation . and legal frameworks operating at national level should be left alone - . it is up to each member state and the sport governing bodies to decide . how they run their national sports.' Other . major proposals in the report include a call on national governments to . make trafficking of performance-enhancing drugs illegal and the . creation of a European database of hooligans.","Blue/yellow flag should be worn by all teams - including football, rugby, cricket and the British Olympic team ."
"By . Jason Groves . Last updated at 2:59 PM on 6th February 2012 . More than 100 Conservative MPs are mounting a rebellion over the Government’s plan to introduce more wind farms. Dozens of backbench Tories have written to David Cameron to demand that the £400million in subsidies paid to the ‘inefficient’ industry each year is ‘dramatically cut’. They are also pressing for a change to planning laws to make it easier for communities to block proposals relating to the unsightly turbines. Contentious issue: Critics argue that there are more effective ways of cutting carbon emissions than using wind turbines . Rebellion: Bernard Jenkin (left) and Nicholas Soames were among the Conservative MPs who wrote to the PM . The protest presents an immediate challenge for the new Liberal Democrat Climate Change Secretary, Ed Davey, who was appointed on Friday after Chris Huhne resigned to fight criminal charges. Former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell warned that ‘things could get very tough’ if the party’s green agenda is derailed. Some 101 Tories, joined by a handful of Lib Dem and Labour MPs, have protested to the Prime Minister that government policy has skewed the energy market too far in favour of onshore wind farms. ‘In these financially straitened times, we think it is unwise to make consumers pay, through taxpayer subsidy, for inefficient and intermittent energy production that typifies onshore wind turbines,’ they wrote. ‘In the ongoing review of renewable energy subsidies, we ask the Government to dramatically cut the subsidy for onshore wind and spread the savings made between other types of reliable renewable energy production and energy-efficiency measures.’ They also expressed concerns that the proposed National Planning Policy Framework ‘diminishes the chances of local people defeating onshore wind farm proposals through the planning system’. Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris, who co-ordinated the campaign, claimed that many Conservative ministers harboured grave doubts about the policy. Critics say the giant turbines are costly and ineffective, in addition to being a blot on the countryside. Hurdle: The protest presents an immediate challenge for the newly-appointed Lib Dem Climate Change Secretary, Ed Davey (left) while Sir Menzies Campbell (right) warned that 'things could get very tough' The letter’s signatories include senior figures such as David Davis, Bernard Jenkin and Nicholas Soames, as well as many new MPs. They hope to hold talks in the coming weeks with the Prime Minister and Mr Davey to discuss their concerns. Downing Street said ministers had already begun work to scale back subsidies for onshore wind farms, but at least 4,500 more turbines are expected to get the green light as part of the Government’s drive to meet EU energy targets – more than doubling Britain’s current number. 'Things could get very tough' Critics argue that there are more effective ways of cutting carbon emissions. Cumbrian Conservative Rory Stewart said recent research suggested that the same effect could be achieved by converting coal-fired power stations to gas. Former Chancellor Lord Lawson, a persistent critic of wind turbines, welcomed the intervention and called for the Department of Energy and Climate Change to be broken up, with responsibility for energy policy returned to the Business Department. ‘Wind power is about the most stupid way of generating electricity you can imagine,’ he said. ‘It produces very expensive electricity even when the wind is blowing at the right speed, which is only 25 per cent of the time.’ But Sir Menzies warned yesterday that Coalition relations ‘could get very tough’ if attempts were made to ‘water down’ the Government’s climate change policy. ‘Commitment to the environment has an iconic place in the Lib Dem approach,’ he said. Mr Davey will attempt to demonstrate his own green credentials today when he and party leader Nick Clegg visit an eco-home development in Watford. He said last night: ‘Greening the economy isn’t just good for the planet, it’s good for the  wallets, purses and pockets of every British citizen too.'","Dozens demand £400m in subsidies to 'inefficient' green industry is 'dramatically cut'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:16 PM on 20th June 2011 . Supporters and opponents of gay marriage clashed yesterday as lawmakers prepared to vote on making New York the biggest state to legalize same-sex marriage. The measure to make gay marriage legal, introduced by Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat and strong advocate, needs just one more vote before it can pass into the state Senate. The state Assembly approved the bill by a wide margin last week, and Monday is the last day of the legislative session before summer recess. Equality: Supporters of gay marriage hold up colourful signs in New York's Central Park on Saturday as they urge lawmakers to back a same-sex marriage bill . Thirty-one senators, including two Republicans, are currently in favor of the bill. Its backers need one more member to back it for it to pass. New York's Archbishop, Timothy Dolan, reiterated his and the Catholic Church's opposition to gay marriage on Sunday, vowing to oppose 'any radical bill to redefine the very essence of marriage.' 'One has to wonder why the proponents of this radical redefinition, who claim overwhelming popular support, would not consider (a referendum) on such a drastic departure from traditional values?' he wrote on his blog. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has become a prominent champion of legalized gay marriage, pushing his state into the centre of the national debate over an emotional and divisive issue. In the past week, the Democrat has personally lobbied wavering Republican lawmakers and has said the extension of marriage rights to gays and lesbians is 'a matter of principle, not politics.' Historic: Hillary, left, and Julie Goodridge are married by Rev. William Sinkford in Boston during first day of state-sanctioned gay marriage in U.S. May 17, 2004 . 'This state has a proud tradition and a proud legacy as the progressive capital of the nation,' he said last Friday. 'We led the way, and it's time for New York to lead the way once again.' The effort carries some political peril but could be potentially rewarding, given evolving public sentiment on gay rights in New York and the nation. 'It looks like a profile in courage, and maybe it is,' said Larry Sabato, director of the Centre for Politics at the University of Virginia. 'But it also may be politically smart in the long run.' Mr Cuomo's support for gay rights is already known to voters in New York, which would become the sixth state to legalise the issue . His efforts this past week to get the bill through the Republican-controlled state Senate - the lone roadblock to passage - make good on an issue he ran on last year. During that campaign, he took his daughters to a gay pride parade in New York City, drawing sharp criticism from his Republican opponent. 'The governor is putting skin in the game and has a steadfast commitment to the issue,' said Kevin Nix of the Human Rights Campaign, a leading gay rights group. 'That he's made marriage equality a priority for this legislative session speaks volumes about his commitment.' As a purely political matter, advocating . for gay marriage makes sense for Democrats in a state like New York, . where gay groups are players in party politics. Mr Cuomo's lobbying, coming . after he pushed through a fiscally conservative budget, also could . burnish his image among liberals. Support: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has been a driving force behind the same-sex marriage bill which is opposed by Archbishop Timothy Dolan (right) Mr Cuomo is an astute politician who was a key player in his father's campaigns for New York governor three decades ago, then was schooled in President Bill Clinton's Cabinet, where he served as Department of Housing and Urban Development secretary. The lessons learned from both are at play during this debate - the lofty, inclusive idealism of his father matched by Clinton's practical politics. He is opposed, though, by some conservative groups and religious leaders. Archbishop  Dolan likened the effort to 'redefine' marriage to something that would be done in China or North Korea. The U.S. federal government does not recognize same-sex marriage, but five individual states do: . Connecticut . Iowa . Massachusetts . New Hampshire . Vermont . (Plus Washington, D.C. and the Coquille Indian Tribe in Oregon) States that recognize same-sex marriage but do not grant same-sex marriage licenses: . New York . Rhode Island . Maryland . Same-sex marriages were legal in California from June 16, 2008 to November 4, 2008, when Proposition 8 passed to prohibit the practice. As of March 2011, 41 states prohibit same-sex marriage via laws or state constitution . A Gallup poll last month found national support for same-sex marriage . going up nine points from the previous year to 53 per cent (support was . at 27 per cent in 1996). Support is highest among young people. Still, polls this year have shown that more than half of voters in New York support gay marriage, with backing heaviest among Democrats. Mr Cuomo's position is also in line with New York's last two governors and its two Democratic U.S. senators. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has been a high-profile advocate of gay rights issues, and Sen. Charles Schumer came out in support of gay marriage in 2009. In fact, the reason mr Cuomo can push for gay marriage is that he holds office in a relatively liberal state. Nationwide, governors supporting same-sex marriage appear to be in the minority. Among them are Democrats Deval Patrick in neighbouring Massachusetts and Jerry Brown in California. Mr Cuomo, less than six months in office, has not said publicly that he wants to run for national office. But his ambition, record of success and relatively young age at 53, raises the question of whether his stance on gay marriage hurt him if he aspires to be president. Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, said the strong opposition to gay marriage around the country is proven by the 30 states with constitutional language defining marriage as between a man and a woman. 'We never lost a public vote on marriage in any state,' he said. A Gallup poll last month found national support for same-sex marriage going up nine points from the previous year to 53 per cent (support was at 27 per cent in 1996). Support is highest among younger people, a major reason why many analysts believe the trend will continue. Mr Sabato said that could make Mr Cuomo's issue a winner for him in the coming years, particularly since many Democratic constituencies who will choose the party's nominee favour same-sex marriage. 'The earliest he could run is 2016,' Mr Sabato said. 'And I think his gamble is that the country is evolving on this issue and moving in New York's direction.' Mr Cuomo has actually shifted on the issue himself, at least in public. He favoured civil unions for same-sex partners during his first, aborted run for New York governor in 2002. At that time, Vermont allowed civil unions. No states would have legal same-sex marriage until Massachusetts in 2004. By the time he ran for attorney general in 2006, he was using the words 'gay marriage.' And he won the race easily. The New York Times had quoted Mr Cuomo as saying he had supported gay marriage in his heart during the 2002 campaign, but didn't make it an issue because the political focus then was on civil unions.","One more vote needed in New York Senate to pass law .

Major question marks hung over Fabio . Capello's status as England coach today after he spoke out in defence of . axed skipper John Terry. There are fears the Italian could quit his job before the European Championships - throwing the team's preparations into jeopardy. Capello told Italian broadcasters he disagreed with the decision of FA bosses to axe Terry as captain before he has stood trial. The . decision to axe the England skipper came three months after Capello had been given full authority . to deal with the Terry issue as he saw fit. Former FA chief . executive David Davies today said that the £6million-per-year England manager . may be in breach of contract after he openly challenged the decision to . strip John Terry of the national team captaincy. 'It is being taken very seriously by the FA because it may be that Fabio Capello has breached his contract,' said Davies. 'You have to ask what his motive is. You have to suspect he wants to . prevent John Terry retiring as a player before Euro 2012 but there are . wider issues. 'You could have what some of the media are calling a morality circus . while England are trying to win the second major tournament in football. 'A contract may have been breached, there is strong leadership now at . the FA from David Bernstein. Last week he wasn't slow to take things . forward and he may not be slow to do so now.' Terry was axed as captain after a court decided he would not face trial over allegations he racially abusing Anton Ferdinand at Loftus . Road in October until July, after Euro 2012. Interviewed by national Italian . broadcaster Rai 1 at Stamford Bridge yesterday afternoon, where he attended . Chelsea's thrilling 3-3 draw with Manchester United, Capello stated . openly how angry he was. Asked whether he was in agreement with 'the Federation's decision re Terry?', Capello replied: 'No, absolutely not. 'I have spoken to the chairman and I . have said that, in my opinion, one cannot be punished until it's . official and the court - a non-sporting court, a civil court - has made a . decision to decide if John Terry has done what he has been accused of. 'I thought it was right that Terry should keep the captain's armband. 'The fact that the board has decided in this way is because it falls under the competence regarding ethics.' Capello is due at Wembley today, . where he will speak with Bernstein before heading to Anfield for . Liverpool's Premier League encounter with Tottenham. This morning bookmakers William Hill slashed odds on the England boss quitting before the Euro 2012 finals get underway in June from 8-1 to 9-2. However, the fact he did attend yesterday's game as planned would seem to be an indication he wants to continue in his job. In the stands: John Terry sat out Chelsea's draw with Manchester United yesterday because of injury . Abuse: Rio Ferdinand, left, the brother of Anton Ferdinand and John Terry's partner at centre-back in the England team, was booed by Chelsea supporters yesterday . However, having challenged the FA so . openly about such a contentious subject, in the process raising the . potential for fierce disagreement with individual England players, there . has to be a possibility of Capello's tenure ending, four years to the . day since his first game in charge, a 2-1 win over Switzerland at . Wembley. The entire issue of the England captaincy has become a noose around Capello's neck. A firm believer of the Italian . mentality where the most experienced player in the squad gets the . armband, Capello was informed of the symbolic nature of the job in . England and duly auditioned Terry, Rio Ferdinand and Steven Gerrard for . the role. Capello thought he had the right man in the Chelsea skipper. He was forced to revise that stance . when an issue in Terry's private life led to Capello demanding his . presence at Wembley in February 2010, when he was removed as captain and . Rio Ferdinand installed as his replacement. On trial: Terry is accused of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand (right) last October in a match at Loftus Road, and will appear in court on July 9 . Ferdinand then got injured during the first day of training at the World Cup in South Africa, meaning Gerrard got the job. Then, after assessing the unseemly . manner in which the armband was handed around during a friendly win over . Denmark in Copenhagen 12 months ago, Capello decided to give Terry the . job back again. Now that decision has exploded in his face once more. Former England international and now . outspoken radio pundit Stan Collymore has labelled the situation as 'a . debacle and a shambles'. In addition to attending today's . game at Anfield, Capello has a busy month ahead and is due to name his . squad on February 25 for the Wembley friendly against World Cup . finalists Holland four days later. Steven Gerrard is expected to take the captain's armband for the friendly.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:54 PM on 5th February 2012 . Some politicians from New York and New England are using the Super Bowl as an opportunity to make a point about their closest causes, or bond with their constituents. New York congressman Gregory Meeks is using it to make some serious cash. Mr Meeks has held pricey Super Bowl parties in the past, and up until two weeks ago, his fundraising agency was still selling $5,000 tickets to his event this year. Smiling for the Super Bowl: Gregory Meeks is thought to be hosting a $5,000-per-ticket event during the game . Now, after the news of the event spread, the details of the party have become harder to come by. Because the NFL allows elected officials to buy tickets to the big game at face value, Mr Meeks could easily purchase a number of tickets for a significantly cheaper rate than his constituents, and donors. While congressmen like Mr Meeks can buy tickets for $800, $900, or $1,200, members of the public are spending up to $2,000 on tickets through websites like StubHub. When asked by The New York Post, Mr Meeks would not say if his costly fundraising event was still being held, and would not even say if he was watching the game in New York or at the stadium in Indiana. In 2010, when no New York team was even playing in the Super Bowl, Mr Meeks held a similar $5,000-per-ticket party in Miami for the game. The seven-term congressman, who . represents a relatively small area in the New York borough of Queens, . has already raised $369,118 during this election cycle. That total ranks . him number 404 of the 539 members of congress in terms of how much . money they have raised since 2011. Mr Meeks (right), seen here with President Obama and first lady Michelle, is a seven term congressman representing a portion of Queens . This is not the first time that Mr Meeks' financial dealings have caused some questions: he was investigated by the House ethics committee in 2010 because of a questionable loan that a donor gave him. He is also thought to have received a number of financial benefits because of his congressional status, including a cut-rate cost on his home and numerous luxury vacations for him and his wife that were paid for by donors. Mr Meeks also had a long-standing . business relationship with R. Allen Stanford, the Ponzi-schemer whose . trial is currently underway.

"By . Emma Reynolds . Last updated at 11:49 AM on 5th February 2012 . Tens of thousands of Russians flooded Moscow city centre today to demand an end to Vladimir Putin's rule. The crowds braved -20C (-4F) temperatures to protest a month before a presidential election Mr Putin is still expected to win. The march - which drew 120,000 people, according to organisers - was the third mass demonstration since Mr Putin's party won a parliamentary election on December 4 with the help of what appeared to be widespread fraud. No more hot air: Protesters storm the streets of Moscow clutching balloons and holding a banner reading, 'Russia without Putin and for fair elections!' Cold calls: Demonstrators brave the chill to demand Putin give up ahead of the March 4 presidential polls . Battle of wills: A Russian woman dreamily holds an anti-Putin sign aloft at the protest, as the prime minister threatens to reclaim his old Kremlin job . The election and Mr Putin's decision to reclaim the presidency proved the last straw for Russians increasingly unhappy with the creeping authoritarianism during his 12-year rule. The rallies - which have brought together liberals, leftists and nationalists - are the biggest in Russia since the demonstrations that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union 20 years ago. Today activists wearing the white ribbons that have become the symbol of the protest movement and chanting 'Russia Without Putin' marched to a square across the river from the Kremlin to stage the rally in the freezing weather. It appeared to be even bigger than December's protests, despite the bitter cold, in a clear statement that anti-Putin sentiment rages as strongly as ever. Shaky ground: Vladimir Putin meets with election monitors in Moscow on Wednesday . Thousands of police monitored the peaceful protest, as a 5,000-strong anti-Putin protest took place simultaneously in St Petersburg, and smaller rallies were held in several dozen other cities across Russia. A rival rally in Moscow in support of Mr Putin drew no more than 20,000 people - most of them teachers, municipal workers, employees of state-owned companies or trade union activists, who had been brought on buses provided by their employers. The anti-Putin protests have been driven by members of the educated and urban middle class. Mr Putin has ignored many of their demands, including for a repeat election, but has tried to assuage their anger with vague promises to introduce liberal reforms and to guarantee a fair presidential vote on March 4. The protest leaders hope to stage another rally a week before the election to keep up the pressure on Mr Putin. He has attempted to counter the anger . by focusing on his core support group of blue-collar workers, farmers, . public servants and the elderly. He also has tried to discredit the . protesters by casting their leaders as Western lackeys working to weaken . Russia. The . presidential race pits Mr Putin against three leaders of parliamentary . parties who have run against him in the past, and one new opponent - the . billionaire owner of the New Jersey Nets basketball team, Mikhail . Prokhorov. Strong challenge: Vocal crowds wearing thick coats and scarves, some covering their faces with balaclavas, joined the giant rally . Public unrest: A masked demonstrator carries a poster which reads, 'Give More Power To The People, please!' as he join the ranks of disillusioned citizens . Solidarity: Several thousand demonstrators turned out in St Petersburg, some wearing paper bags over their heads to disguise their identities . Statement: Leftists carry red flags while marching to take part in the anti-Putin Moscow rally . He joined today's protest but did not take the stage. None of the contenders is expected to pose any serious challenge to Mr Putin, whose ratings are now hovering just below the 50 per cent needed for a first-round victory. If he fails to win an outright victory, he would face a run-off three weeks later, most likely against Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov, a rival he could easily defeat. Protesters at today's rally denounced the race as illegitimate, pointing to the tight controls Mr Putin has imposed over the political scene that have destroyed all genuine political competition.","Demonstrators took to streets of St Petersburg and other Russian cities .

Taxpayers face a £1 billion bill to shore up the Houses of Parliament against chronic subsidence, which is already causing Big Ben to lean alarmingly. The problem is so severe that MPs are even being asked to consider the radical proposal of selling off the historic building and moving into newly built offices – a move that could net £500 million for the Exchequer. Although politicians are unlikely to agree to abandon a site that has been the seat of power for about 1,000 years, the fact that Commons Speaker John Bercow has floated the idea indicates the scale of the problem. Work needed: Taxpayers face a £1billion bill to shore up the Houses of Parliament against chronic subsidence . MPs will hold a crisis meeting tomorrow to consider the options. The all-party House of Commons Commission, chaired by Mr Bercow, will be shown surveyors’ reports detailing the risk of sinking into the Thames mud, electrical problems, fire risks and multiple safety hazards. Even the boilers, dating from before the Second World War, are said to be ‘ready to blow’. Repairs to the building, which would have to start by the end of the decade, would take at least five years to complete, with large sections sealed off on a rolling basis and MPs and their staff moving into temporary offices. Even the Commons Chamber would have to be abandoned for at least two years. One insider said the mock-Gothic building was ‘an elegant disaster’ that is ‘sinking into the mud’. He said: ‘The accountants argue it is not logical to spend £1 billion to repair an estate that is worth £1 billion. Radical: Commons Speaker John Bercow, pictured here with wife Sally, is asking MPs to consider selling off the Houses of Parliament . ‘So the stark choice is to spend the money and look extravagant, or to abandon one of the most iconic buildings in the world and sell it to the Russians or Chinese.’ The worst problems are linked to subsidence caused by decades of Tube trains rattling past the foundations and work on the underground Commons car park. These have caused Big Ben’s bell tower to tilt 18 in from the vertical – enough for tourists to start noticing. Cracks have also started to appear in the walls of the Palace. Moving MPs would cause headaches. Options include using the Lords Chamber, as happened during the Second World War when a bomb destroyed the Commons chamber, or relocating to a secret emergency base that is ready for use in the event of a terrorist attack. Treasury rules on the use of public money oblige MPs to consider even the most ‘radical options’, and selling Parliament would make sense in simple financial terms. The site could be sold to a developer as a heritage site for £1 billion, while a replacement could be built elsewhere for £500 million – roughly the final cost of the over-budget Scottish Parliament in Holyrood, Edinburgh, at 2012 prices. Mr Bercow’s advisers point to the Treasury’s Green Book on the use  of public money, which says that all ‘radical options’ on property development should be considered including ‘changing locations or sites’. The guidelines add: ‘These options . may not become part of the formal appraisal, but can be helpful to test . the parameters of feasible solutions. Well-run brainstorming sessions can help generate such a range of ideas.’ Repair work needed: The subsidence problem is causing Big Ben to lean alarmingly . The first palace to be built in Westminster was used as the primary London residence for the Monarch. The Commons first assembled  there in 1213 when non-baronial representatives of the people were summoned to give their consent to tax laws. The present building was erected between 1840 and 1870. Last night, a Commons spokesman confirmed that the sale of Parliament was included among the  proposals, but pointed out that as the building was listed, it was a ‘complicated’ option. ‘Any large future project would follow normal public-sector guidance on costing and the evaluation of all feasible options,’ he said. ‘The Commission will be considering whether to ask officials from both Houses to undertake a study into the long-term approach to the maintenance of Parliament. ‘No decisions are likely to be made for several years as to whether either House will need to move out of the Palace for a period to allow essential work to take place.’","Repairs to the Houses of Parliament would take five years to complete .

He’s been munching through fruit, cake and sausages for more than 40 years…but children still haven’t lost their appetite for The Very Hungry Caterpillar. Eric Carle’s 1969 tale about a caterpillar that becomes a butterfly is the most read children’s book in Britain, a study revealed yesterday. Researchers estimate it is read an average of nine times a year by the nation’s 5.5million primary school children. Nation's favourite: The Very Hungry Caterpillar, first released in 1969, is still British primary school children's most popular book, with nine reads each year . The second most popular book is the Cinderella fairytale, read around 8.7 times a year, according to the poll of 2,000 parents. The report, commissioned by the Early Learning Centre, also found parents actively encourage their children to read books they enjoyed as youngsters, prompting the comeback of a string of classics. Popular: Books about Postman Pat, and his trusty cat Jess, came in at fifth in the poll with 7.49 reads each year . Yesterday Nicki Tracey, Head of Brand . Communications for the Early Learning Centre said: 'A huge amount of . parents are familiar with the story of The Very Hungry Caterpillar and . it’s a book that has obviously been passed down through the generations. 'It’s great to see so many books on . this list that parents have obviously enjoyed themselves as children and . as a result encouraged their own children to read and love as well. 'It’s especially good to see that so . many parents and children enjoy reading these stories that they re-read . the same books over and over. 'Reading boosts children’s development, teaches them new words and helps them discover and learn about the world.' The third most read books were Roger Hargreaves’ Mr Men series followed by the Peppa Pig books based on the Channel 5 TV show and John Cunliffe’s Postman Pat adventures. Parents and children read about . Postman Pat’s adventures an average of 7.5 times a year while The .

The study also found most parents said their children picked up a book and either read to themselves or got their parents to read it every day. And ninety per cent claim their children read or were read to at least three times a week. Parents also agreed that sons and daughters had very different tastes when it came to their reading habits but both preferred adventure stories. One in five parents admitted to bribing their children to read by offering them pocket money. Technology has also had an impact on how children read with more than a quarter of parents saying their child had read a story on an e-reader. The poll also found 12 per cent of parents said their offspring liked reading books based on films or TV shows.","Cinderella, Postman Pat, Fireman Sam and Spot the Dog also make top ten ."
"By . Suzannah Hills . Last updated at 4:56 AM on 4th February 2012 . The elder daughters of Australia's wealthiest woman have pleaded for bodyguards, a cook and cash in the lead-up to taking her to court over the family trust, new documents reveal. Heiress Gina Rinehart, dubbed the Iron Lady, has been embroiled in an ongoing feud with three of her four children, John, Bianca and Hope, over the family fortune left by her father, mining magnate Lang Hancock. Perth-based Ms Rinehart, 57, tried to get details of the rift suppressed with court reporting restrictions on security grounds that it would put her at risk of extortion but she was unsuccessful. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Family fortunes: Heiress Gina Rinehart, right, with her daughter Ginia Rinehart - the only one of the Rinehart children to take her mother's side . And now embarrassing email correspondence, dating from July and August last year, between Ms Rinehart and two of her daughters has revealed the details of their row after they were tendered in to the New South Wales Supreme Court yesterday. The emails lift the lid on their secret lives of luxury and offers the first real insight into Australia's richest family. In one email, daughter Hope Rinehart Welker emailed her mother asking for $225,000 for a chef to prepare 'detailed menus and food for most or all family and social events' as a birthday present. The 26-year-old wrote: 'I need a few things for my birthday (cook so you can be sure April is fed right, bodyguard so the kids are safe and housekeeper that is good kids so if I need to go out I can) and I found a great agency here that sources the best, here are the descriptions and costs, I would buy them myself but I'm down to my last $60 000 and your only paying my husband $1 a year.' Ms Welker, who lives in New York, . also complained that her mother had tried to get her to move to . Singapore or Australia to save money. She . continued: 'I don't want to have to move back to one of your . 'desirable' countries again just to save every cent...it's not fair you . are selfishly pressuring me to move to Singapore and Australia just . because you hate America.' And another daughter, Bianca Rinehart, 31, who lives in Vancouver, also requested a bodyguard. Queen Elizabeth talks with Gina Rinehart during State Reception held at Government House in October last year . She wrote to her mother: 'We are, by all accounts, the highest risk family in all of Australia for future similar attacks. 'I would like to have security personnel present as you have with Kevin. Unfortunately I do not have the financial means to achieve this and ask that you consider sponsoring such an arrangement or please makes funds available.' Ms Welker also complained about the 'peer pressure' that comes with being a member of one of the country's richest families - adding that her mother 'didn't understand'. She said: 'I don't think you understand what it means now that the whole world thinks you're going to be wealthier than Bill Gates - it means we all need bodyguards and very safe homes!! I should have enough money to have a bodyguard, housekeeper and cook. Even my friends who have nothing compared to your wealth have more staff.' Ms Rinehart, whose fortune from her minerals empire more than doubled in 2011 to A$10.3 billion (£6.8 billion) because of a commodities boom, has tried desperately to suppress publication of details of her dispute with three of her four children. She is said to shun the limelight and is bound to be mortified about the contents of the emails. It was revealed in September last year that Ms Rineheart was being sued by her children for control of the family trust. Only one of her three children, daughter Ginia Rinehart, has taken her mother's side. The rise of the 'Pilbara Princess' Rinehart is the Asia-Pacific region's wealthiest woman, based on Forbes' tally . Australian Gina Rinehart could soon become the world's wealthiest woman after amassing an $18billion fortune from mining and media investments, Forbes magazine said in its latest list of the wealthiest people in Australia. The 57-year-old widow saw her fortune almost double after a deal signed last month that will see South Korean steel giant POSCO take a 15 per cent stake in her Roy Hill iron ore mine in Western Australia's Pilbara iron belt. The deal valued the project at $10billion, boosting Rinehart's fortune dramatically. In the next few years, Rinehart also has plans to expand her iron ore operations and develop two coal collieries. If . commodity prices hold up, Rinehart could challenge Christie Walton, . worth $24.5billion as the world's richest woman, Forbes said. Christie Walton is the widow of John Walton, one of the sons of Sam Walton, the founder of retail chain Wal-Mart Stores . For now, Rinehart will have to be content with being the Asia-Pacific region's wealthiest woman, based on Forbes' tally. Rinehart . is the daughter of Lang Hancock, an Australian prospector credited with . discovering giant deposits of iron ore in the 1950s that now make up . Australia's largest export base. China alone relies of Australian iron ore for nearly half its imports of the key steel-making ingredient, and Japan, South Korea and Taiwan also are big buyers for their steel mills. Known as the 'Pilbara Princess', Rinehart is also building stakes in some of Australia's largest media companies, drawing comparisons to another famously powerful Australian, Rupert Murdoch, head of News Corp and now a U.S. citizen. Rinehart this week became the largest shareholder in Fairfax Media by more than tripling her stake in the newspaper, digital and radio broadcasting company. She already owns 10 per cent of rival Ten Network Holdings.","Hope Rinehart Welker told her mother she was down to her last $60,000 dollars .

"By . James Chapman, Becky Barrow and Jason Groves . Last updated at 11:33 AM on 20th July 2011 . While Westminster fiddled over the phone-hacking frenzy, the European economy was burning last night. World financial watchdogs issued an extraordinary warning of a global economic ‘earthquake’ triggered by the failure of many countries to get to grips with massive debts. To add insult to injury, it emerged yesterday that those largely responsible for bringing Britain’s economy to its knees – bankers and finance workers – have scooped bonuses totalling £14billion this year. Overshadowed: The attack on Rupert Murdoch and his and Rebekah Brooks's evidence to a Select Committee turned attention away from a warning that the European economy was on the brink of an 'earthquake' Meltdown: Failure of eurozone countries to get control of their debts could lead to billions being wiped off the global economy, experts have warned . While the phone-hacking scandal will be investigated by a public inquiry led by a  senior judge, there has been no equivalent investigation into the actions of bankers and the Government’s failure to hold them to account for triggering the financial crisis. There were growing calls for Westminster to lift its gaze from phone-hacking and focus on the threat to the livelihoods of millions. As the Commons hearings into the scandal . descended into farce when a protester tried to attack Rupert Murdoch . with a foam pie, David Cameron, speaking in Lagos, Nigeria, pledged to . focus on issues that ‘really  matter’ to people amid fears the . Government is beginning to look paralysed by the phone-hacking furore. Focus: David Cameron said that the government must 'get on with those things that really matter to Britain, which is making sure there are jobs and exports' Cameron will be looking to find answers to the financial crisis as French President Nicolas Sarkozy jets into Berlin today for a summit with Angela Merkel aimed at forging a . common stance on the Greek rescue package as the eurozone lurches closer . to collapse. The Prime Minister, who cut short a tour of Africa last night to return to address MPs, said: ‘It is important for the British Prime Minister and  Government to get on with those things that really matter to Britain, which is making sure there are jobs and exports.’ While there were ‘serious questions’ for parts of the media, police and politicians to answer over phone hacking, Mr  Cameron insisted voters ‘don’t want us to lose our focus on an economy that provides good jobs, an immigration system that works for Britain and a welfare system that is fair’. Office of National Statistics  figures showed that between April 2010 and March 2011, a total of £13.6billion in bonuses was paid out to workers in the ‘finance and insurance’ sector. They account for just 4 per cent of the workers in this country, but get about 40 per cent of the bonuses paid. The size of the massive windfall will outrage millions of hard-working Britons who face a daily battle to stay financially afloat during the economic downturn. Their finances are under attack from tax rises, pay freezes or paltry pay rises, soaring gas bills, rip-off petrol prices – and no bonus from their boss. The figures reveal the average finance and insurance worker got a bonus of £12,500. The average worker in Britain, who does not get a bonus, has to work for six months to earn that much. Some of the big bonus winners even work for banks which are part-owned by the taxpayer. There are 323 ‘key staff’ at Royal Bank of Scotland who shared a pay and bonus pot of £375million last year, an average of £1.16million each. By comparison, the rest of the country is being crippled by the first fall in disposable household income since 1981, according to the ONS. Warnings: Nick Clegg said he was 'incredibly worrried' about financial turmoil in Europe, while Lord Lamont claimed Parliament appeared 'obsessed' by Rupert Murdoch . Andrew Simms, of the New Economics . Foundation, said: ‘Timidity and collusion on banking reform will be even . more dangerous than failure on press oversight. If there is one thing . we have learnt, it is that when profits are to be made, self-regulation . doesn’t work. ‘Government timidity over banking . reform has left us with an arrogant and overly powerful elite in the . banks we bailed out who feel able to award themselves huge bonuses, . while the public pays the price for a crisis they caused. This can’t go . on. ‘Government can still get ahead of the game with the banks, but they must act quickly.’ As . the International Monetary Fund warned that the Eurozone debt crisis . could trigger an ‘earthquake’ that slashes hundreds of billions of . pounds off the global economy, Lord Lamont, the former Tory Chancellor, . said Parliament appeared ‘obsessed’ by Rupert Murdoch and wrongdoing in . parts of his media empire. He said: ‘There is a much more serious crisis growing on the European continent.’ Deputy . Prime Minister Nick Clegg said at the weekend he was ‘incredibly . worried’ that spiralling financial turmoil in Europe and America’s . failure to agree on how to tackle its vast debts could drag down the . British economy. UK economic figures due next week are expected to show that the economy is already flatlining. Douglas Carswell, the Conservative MP for Clacton, said: ‘We are on the brink of financial Armageddon with cataclysmic events engulfing Europe and possibly even America. ‘It’s time to stop focusing on the soap opera and start focusing on the substance. ‘The entire tribe of SW1 is obsessed with which media figures met with which politicians, but the issue that will directly impact millions of British households is bonds and debt.’ Philip Hollobone, Tory MP for Kettering, said: ‘The phone-hacking scandal is of course a big issue, but it should not overshadow the real concern – the possible collapse of the Eurozone, which will have huge repercussions for Britain. ‘This is something that could plunge the country back into recession and cost thousands of jobs.’ Lord Oakeshott, the former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said: ‘These banking bonus figures show sheer greed. Our country won’t believe “we are all in this together” until the Government gets a grip on bank bonuses. ‘Our broken banking system is just as toxic for Britain as politicians and police crawling up to Murdoch. We must get to the bottom of both scandals.’ Max Lawson, from the Robin Hood Tax campaign, which is calling for a new tax on banks, said: ‘The scandal that should be investigated is bankers who are seemingly accountable to no-one and have got away with billions of taxpayers’ money, while this Government has not done enough to deal with it.’","Bankers scoop £14billion bonuses as eurozone nears collapse .

"By . Political Reporter . Last updated at 3:09 PM on 6th February 2012 . Tory MPs last night urged David Cameron to seize back from Brussels up to 130 powers over crime and policing. In a show of strength, more than 100 Conservative MPs have written to the Prime Minister urging him to return control over a range of contentious crime measures to Westminster. The intervention steps up pressure on Mr Cameron to take a tough stance on Europe, despite the concerns of his Liberal Democrat Coalition colleagues. Pressure: David Cameron, left, was urged to give more control back to Westminster by MPs including Cabinet minister John Redwood, right . The letter, signed by former Cabinet ministers John Redwood and Peter Lilley and the current chairman of the party’s powerful 1922 Committee, Graham Brady, warns that Britain has just two years to ‘opt out’ of the measures before they become irreversible. Powers at stake include the European Arrest Warrant, which has seen more than 200 British nationals handed over to prosecutors in other EU states. Use of the power has brought accusations of false arrest, alarmed civil liberties groups and led to warnings that it is a major step towards establishing a single European prosecutor. MPs are also demanding action to remove the UK from a requirement that police share DNA and fingerprint data with other European police forces – another measure that has alarmed civil liberties campaigners. Making a stand: Dominic Raab, pictured, wrote the letter along with fellow Tory MP Charlie Elphicke . In their letter to the Prime Minister, published in the Daily Telegraph, they state: ‘We should maintain our national standards of justice and democratic control over crime and policing – but let other nations integrate more closely if they wish. ‘We do not wish to subordinate UK authorities to a pan-European Public Prosecutor. ‘We do not want to see British police forces subjected to mandatory demands by European police under the European Investigation Order.’ Eurosceptic Tories want Mr Cameron to exploit a clause in the 2009 Lisbon Treaty that gives Britain a one-off opportunity to opt out of a range of measures on justice and home affairs. They warn that unless he takes the step by June 2014, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg could insist Britain enforces them. The letter was organised by MPs Dominic Raab and Charlie Elphicke, who insist their aim is to assist Mr Cameron. Mr Elphicke said: ‘Euro crimes, Euro police and Euro prosecutors are not right for the UK because our criminal system is so different. The pragmatic thing would be to opt out of the lot. We can always opt in at a later date because it is the right thing to do for Britain.’ Mr Raab added: ‘The last thing the UK needs is the European Courts of Justice in Luxembourg doing for British crime and policing what the Strasbourg court has done for human rights.’ ¿We do not want to see British police forces subjected to mandatory demands by European police under the European Investigation Order, says the letter to the Prime Minister .",They say European justice not right for UK .
"By . Paul Revoir . Last updated at 1:44 AM on 6th February 2012 . Comments: Kirsty Young is concerned about the vanishing of older women from television . Kirsty Young has attacked TV bosses for their obsession with younger women, claiming viewers  do not just want to see ‘shiny 22-year-olds’. The Desert Island Discs presenter, 43, claimed men were not treated in the same discriminatory way as women. She said: ‘I see men on television all the time and I think, “Would his female equivalent be on there?”. Not a hope in hell.’ In an interview with entertainment magazine The Word, the Crimewatch host stressed it was ‘smart’ to reflect the age of the TV audience, adding: ‘They’ll like you for it.’ She also criticised the BBC’s axing of Strictly Come Dancing judge Arlene Phillips, adding: ‘I think it was very clever when Chris Evans took on Moira Stuart as his sidekick, to be honest. ‘People responded to that because they don’t just want to see shiny 22-year-olds with capped teeth. Why? Because that’s not who we are.’ This comes as a BBC-commissioned report released last week revealed that both male and female viewers were concerned about the vanishing of older women from screens, with more than a third of women over 55 saying there were too few of their contemporaries on TV. It was said that ‘a person develops “a face for radio” at a certain point in their middle years’ and were ‘replaced with what people felt were less qualified but younger, more attractive women’. Viewers also felt women were treated in a different way to older men as people pointed out how along with older male newsreaders, names such as Sir Bruce Forsyth and Sir David Attenborough had carried on broadcasting well beyond retirement age. The Desert Island Discs presenter criticised the axing of Strictly's judge Arlene Phillips (left) and praised Chris Evans (right) for taking on Moira Stuart as his sidekick . She recently said she did not get her big break as a 27-year-old, presenting Channel 5 news, ‘because of her looks’, which she described as ‘average’ but because they thought she could do the job. Miss Young also admitted she did not see why she should not be doing Desert Island Discs until she was 85. In the latest magazine interview she also criticised the culture of 24 hour news warning the ‘ramped up’ style of much it risks turning the content into ‘white noise’ that risked the possibility that people ‘tune out’ during important stories. She added there was an element of ‘artificiality’ about the way headline stories are treated, which was ‘dangerous’. She told The Word: ‘I’m ambitious to try to make a good and interesting life, and I hope that the days of women feeling they have to be apologetic for that are soon over. ‘I see men on television all the time and I think, “Would his female equivalent be on there?”. Not a hope in hell. Not a hope in hell. Look at Arelene Phillips being chucked off Strictly a few years ago. I mean, whoever thought that was a smart decision to make?’ Different rules: Sir Bruce Forsyth (left) and Sir David Attenborough (right) have both carried on broadcasting well beyond retirement age . Miss Young, who been a the forefront of Desert Island Discs 70th anniversary celebrations, said she thought now that people are being ‘scrutinised’ over the issue, they would make ‘smarter choices’. She added: ‘Well, this is smart: reflect the people who are watching. They’ll like you for it.’ This comes after the presenter Kirsty Young recently revealed her drive to succeed stems from a ‘sense of abandonment’ after her father left when she was a baby. She had told the Radio Times her early rejection has left her with a feeling of ‘not being good enough’ that has motivated her to prove otherwise. Miss Young’s biological father, Joe Jackson, a policeman, left the family when she was just a few weeks old. Her mother Catherine married carpenter John Young - the man the star regards as her father - when she was a toddler and they have been married for 39 years. In the BBC report for the Creative Diversity Network Viewers were concerned that women ‘had been replaced with what people felt were less qualified but younger, more attractive women’. According to the report: ‘There was a particular and strong concern voiced about the lack of middle-aged and older female representation on television.’",Desert Island Discs presenter attacks TV bosses for obsession with younger women .

"By . Hugo Gye . Last updated at 10:47 PM on 6th February 2012 . Pigs at one of Walmart's pork suppliers are being cruelly mistreated, according to animal-rights campaigners. An undercover video filmed by the Humane Society of the United States appears to show pigs in cages so small they can barely move. The pigs are recorded squealing loudly, and several of them are bleeding or displaying other injuries. One particularly graphic moment comes when a newborn piglet has his tail and testicles cut off, apparently without any anaesthetic. Scroll down for video . Cages: Campaigners claim that 'gestation crates' which do not allow animals to turn around, such as these ones from Seaboard Foods' facility in Goodwell, Oklahoma are cruel . Pig: Pork produced by Seaboard goes to a variety of retailers, including Walmart, the largest in the U.S. The Humane Society is now taking legal action against Seaboard Foods, the third-largest pork supplier in the U.S. and one of Walmart's suppliers, over the conditions at their facility in Goodwell, Oklahoma. In papers filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the charity claimed that Seaboard was 'misleading stakeholders through unlawful statements and omissions about Seaboard Foods' animal welfare practices'. A Humane Society spokesman condemned the company's use of gestation crates, narrow cages which do not allow animals to turn around, calling the practice 'out of step with mainstream American values about the proper treatment of animals'. Sows are kept in gestation crates when they are pregnant - which in many cases means spending nearly their whole lives in the cages. Large scale: There are believed to be 2,700 caged sows at the Goodwell facility . Castration: Piglets routinely have their tails and testicles removed - apparently, often without anaesthetic . But Seaboard has defended its . treatment of its animals, claiming in a statement that the company is . determined to 'provide the most humane treatment for our animals.' The . statement also said: 'We are proud of our employees for exemplifying . best practices in their day-to-day work and truly being leaders within . the industry.' The company claims that the use of stalls to house livestock is not necessarily less humane than housing them in group stalls, and points out that tail docking and castration are recommended by vets. A spokesman for Walmart told the Huffington Post that the retail giant was co-operating with Seaboard in a review of the situation. She said that Seaboard Foods 'supply a very small percentage overall of pork products' to Walmart as one of around 100 pork suppliers. Cuts: Several of the animals in the Humane Society's undercover video appear to be injured . However, the Humane . Society claims there is a disconnect between the companies' public . statements and the standards they apply in practice, including to the . 2,700 sows at the Goodwell facility. Wayne . Pacelle, president and CEO of the organisation, said 'our findings are . in stark contrast to claims Seaboard makes about animal welfare'. According to the Humane Society, Seaboard's advisor on animal welfare has told the company: I feel very strongly that we've got to treat animals right, and the gestation stalls have got to go. 'Confining an animal for most of its life in a box in which it is not able to turn around does not provide a decent life.' This is not the first time Walmart has faced criticism relating to its sale of pork. In October, the firm was forced to close several stores in China after pork was allegedly mislabelled as organic.

"By . Ted Thornhill . Last updated at 9:41 AM on 15th December 2011 . Supernovae are bright, so bright they can sometimes be seen with the naked eye, despite being hundreds of thousands of light years away. Now astronomers from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California have caught radiation from the brightest category of supernova – the type Ia – just 11 hours after it exploded. Called SN 2011fe, it was seen in the Pinwheel Galaxy 21million light years away. Not since 1986 has a type Ia been spotted this close to Earth. Before and after: Pinwheel Galaxy before (left) and after (right) the supernova called SN2011fe happened - it's the bright blue dot bottom right. It's the brightest and closest stellar explosion seen in 25 years . The light from thousands of type Ia's have been studied, but until now their physics - how they detonate and what the star systems that produce them actually look like before they explode - has been educated guesswork. A supernova occurs when a star dies or when a white dwarf star sucks matter from a nearby star, eventually reaches a critical point and explodes with extraordinary ferocity and brightness - the equivalent of at least 10 billion suns. A star dying is a type II, a type Ia is the latter variety and the most luminous. Peter Nugent from the Berkeley Lab said: ‘We caught the supernova just 11 hours after it exploded, so soon that we were later able to calculate the actual moment of the explosion to within 20 minutes.’ There's a specific limit to how massive the white dwarf can grow, equal to about 1.4 times the mass of our Sun, before it can no longer support itself against gravitational collapse. Explosive facts: A type II supernova caught by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2005 - 160,000 light years away . ‘As it approaches the limit, conditions are met in the centre so that the white dwarf detonates in a colossal thermonuclear explosion, which converts the carbon and oxygen to heavier elements including nickel,’ says Nugent. ‘A shock wave rips through it and ejects the material in a bright expanding photosphere. Much of the brightness comes from the heat of the radioactive nickel as it decays to cobalt. ‘Light also comes from ejecta being heated by the shock wave, and if this runs into the companion star it can be reheated, adding to the luminosity.’ Because they could closely study the supernova during its first few days, the team was able to gather the first direct evidence for what at least one type Ia looked like before it exploded, and what happened next. Light fantastic: SN 2011fe glows bright - from 21million light years away . Daniel Kasen, an assistant professor of astronomy and physics at UC Berkeley and a faculty scientist in Berkeley Lab's Nuclear Science Division, said: ‘It only takes a few seconds for the shock wave to tear apart the star, but the debris heated in the explosion will continue to glow for several hours. ‘The bigger the star, the brighter this afterglow. Because we caught this supernova so early, and with such sensitive observations, we were able to directly constrain the size of the progenitor.’ ‘Sure enough, it could only have been a white dwarf,’ says Nugent. ‘The spectra gave us the carbon and oxygen, so we knew we had the first direct evidence that a Type Ia supernova does indeed start with a carbon-oxygen white dwarf.’ Mark Sullivan of Oxford University said: ‘Understanding how these giant explosions create and mix materials is important because supernovae are where we get most of the elements that make up the Earth and even our own bodies - for instance, these supernovae are a major source of iron in the universe. So we are all made of bits of exploding stars.’ Their results are reported in the December 15 2011 issue of the journal Nature.","The supernova lies 21million light years away, but astronomers caught the radiation from the explosion just 11 hours after it began arriving at Earth ."

Police will begin scouring a landfill for the body of five-year-old Jhessye Shockley - four months after the youngster was reported missing. It could take Glendale police in Arizona up to six weeks to sift through more than 6,000 tons of trash at Butterfield Station Landfill in Mobile. Authorities believe the body of the child, who was reported missing on October 11, was thrown into a dumpster and transported to the landfill. Scroll down for videos . Investigation: Police will begin searching for the body of five-year-old Jhessye Shockley, who has been missing since October 11, in an Arizona landfill . The search will happy every day, eight hours a day, for up to six weeks . Compacted trash will be spread out over an area of 180 feet by 200 feet for a team to sift through with rakes, The Arizona Republic reported. The search of the specific section of the landfill comes two months after police first considered scouring the dump for the youngster's remains. Jhessye was reported missing in October by her mother Jerice Hunter, who became the primary focus in the police investigation. According to a court document, Jhessye's 13-year-old sister told police her mother kept the girl in a closet, and that Jhessye had black eyes, cuts and bruises before she was reported . missing. The teen recounted an incident just weeks earlier when Hunter returned home to find Jhessye wearing a . long T-shirt while watching TV with a boy. She told the girl . that she was a 'ho' before taking her into a bedroom, according to the . document. Massive site: Search teams will sift through 6,000 tons of trash for the body . Hopeful: Police say they know the exact date the body was dumped and where . The teen said she could hear her sister screaming and crying in the room, the document said. She also told police that Hunter kept . Jhessye in a bedroom closet and deprived her of food and water, according to the document. '(She) reported that Jhessye's hair . had been pulled out and described Jhessye as not looking alive and that . she looked like a zombie,' it said. '(She) said that the . closet where Jhessye had been looked like a grave and smelled like dead . people.' The teen said Hunter placed incense in a container to conceal the odor. She also said that a few days before . Jhessye disappeared, her mother spent the entire day cleaning the . apartment and cleaning her shoes from the closet with soap and bleach. Police said they found a receipt that showed Hunter bought food and a . bottle of bleach two days before she reported her daughter missing. In court: Jhessye's mother Jerice Hunter is the primary focus of the investigation. She appeared in court on child abuse charges and is held on a $100,000 bail . Hunter was arrested on a felony count . of child abuse, more than five weeks after she reported Jhessye's disappearance. Hunter was held on a $100,000 bond and has appeared in court, where she has protested her innocence. Hunter claims she went out for an errand and left the girl in the . care of three older siblings at their apartment. AZCentral.com reported the sister said the last time she saw Jhessye . was September 12. The report says school records indicate Jhessy'e last . day at school was September 22. Police have said they no longer expect to find the five-year-old alive. A spokesman told the Arizona Republic that authorities are determined to search as long as it takes to find the body. 'Cruel parents': Jerice Hunter (left) was also arrested on earlier child abuse charges in October 2005 with then-husband, George . Shockley, (right) 'That means ripping every single bag, going through everything,' said the spokesman. Police told ABC15.com that 40 people will work eight hours a day on the operation. Glendale Police Chief Steve Conrad added: 'We would love nothing more than to find . Jhessye and hold the person who is responsible for her death . accountable. I feel we owe . that to her, her family and the community.' Police were unable to recover bodies during two searches of the same landfill in the late 90s. Lisa Vance, who helped raise the girl while her mother served time in prison for child abuse, told The Republic: 'I'm very confident that when they go out there, however many days it takes, they are going to find Jhessye. They just have to.' But Hunter's attorney, Scott Maasen, expressed surprise that authorities had not launched the search sooner. Worrying: Jhessye vanished from her hometown of Glendale without a trace . 'They said almost two months ago they . were possibly going to search the landfill,' he said. 'It begs the . question, why has there been a delay for so long?' Police claim they spent recent months figuring out the specific day they believe the body was dumped so a search would be more successful. Hunter, whom police have named as a 'number one' interest in the case, has also been critical of the investigation into finding her daughter: . She said in December: 'We feel that law enforcement is not . active in finding Jhessye and that they're more active in persecuting me . instead of finding out where she is.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:50 AM on 7th February 2012 . A Los Angeles school where one teacher is accused of feeding his semen to students and another allegedly abused two girls will close for two days. The superintendent of the school district, John Deasy, will meet with worried parents of Miramonte Elementary School pupils on Monday night. Classes at the school - where the two teachers allegedly abused children as young as six - will then be cancelled on Tuesday and Wednesday. Arrested: Miramonte Elementary School teachers Martin Springer, left, and Mark Berndt, right, have been accused of sexual crimes against their students . Schools spokesperson Monica Carzo was not certain what would be happening on campus over the two days or whether staff would be there. Although classes are scheduled to go ahead as normal on Monday, some parents have already removed their children from the school. The ruckus comes after teacher Mark Berndt, 61, was charged with carrying out lewd acts on 23 children who were aged six to 10. He allegedly blindfolded . the students in his classroom and fed them his semen with a spoon. Children were allegedly told was a 'tasting game'. The teacher, who had worked at the school for 32 years, allegedly carried out the acts between 2005 and 2010. He has been jailed on $23 million bail and could face life behind bars if convicted. Concern: Students are escorted to a bus outside Miramonte Elementary school, which will be closed for two days this week following the teachers' arrests . Teacher Martin Springer, 49, was . arrested on Friday - just four days later - on suspicion of fondling two . girls in his classroom. He is being held on $2 million bail. The Los Angeles Times later revealed that the two teachers knew each other . and had taken students on at least two joint field trips over the . past decade. One victim has come forward to speak about her ordeal. The girl, who was in Mark Berndt’s . second grade class in 2008, came home from school and showed her parents . a picture of her eating a cookie with a gleaming, light-coloured . substance visible. She was transferred to Martin Springer’s class, where her father alleges Springer touched her on her leg and thigh. Her parents told the LA Times they had chosen to forget the alleged incidences . until they saw Berndt had been charged. Accused: Teacher Mark Berndt, pictured with a student in 2003, is suspected of blindfolding children in his class and spoon feeding them his semen . Good citizen: This 2003 photo shows Berndt with another student, who is holding a citizenship diploma given to her by the former second-grade teacher . The paper added that detectives . have records that the girl transferred from one class to the next. ‘As a parent, it’s very painful. I don’t want to know much more,’ the father told the Times. Detectives anticipate that more victims might come forward. Detectives interviewed Springer and . the alleged victims on Thursday and had him under surveillance. He was pulled from a . classroom at the school on Friday and arrested on . suspicion of fondling two girls over a period of three years, an . official said. He will appear in court on Tuesday. Just days earlier, third-grade teacher Berndt was accused of photographing blindfolded, bound and gagged . children, some of whom had giant cockroaches sitting on their faces and . mouths. School playground: A student enters Miramonte Elementary School in Los Angeles earlier this week . He was removed from his position a year ago after a film . processor alerted police to the disturbing photos. Springer was arrested based on information that came . forward after the first arrest was announced, Sheriff's Capt. Mike . Parker said, but there was no known connection between the two cases. The victims in the second case were about seven-years-old and allegedly fondled in a classroom. The number of complaints about teacher molestation has increased since news spread of the shocking allegations. Parents have expressed fury that they . were not told about the horrifying photographs a year ago, when . Berndt was removed from the school. Authorities have also acknowledged that a 10-year-old girl claimed Berndt tried to fondle her as far back as 1994. Prosecutors declined to file to charges against Berndt in the 1993 report, saying they didn't have enough evidence. Alleged scene of the crime: Police outside Miramonte Elementary school in Los Angeles . Classes were scheduled to go ahead as normal on Monday, but some parents said they planned to keep their children home. Others immediately took their children out of school after Springer was arrested on Friday. Parents told TV stations they would be holding a protest outside the school on Monday. Parent Saul Ortiz told KTTV-TV he would out picketing the school. 'I want that guy dealt with,' Ortiz said of Berndt. 'The thought sickens you, it just sickens you inside.' Ida Santana said her sister called her and told her to pick up her nephew after the arrest. 'It's hard to leave our kids here,' Santana said. 'We can't trust the teachers no more. Now there's another teacher.'","Mark Berndt, 61, accused of blindfolding students and feeding them his own semen on cookies .

"By . Graham Smith . Last updated at 3:34 PM on 6th February 2012 . The main Palestinian political rivals today took a major step towards healing their bitter rift by agreeing that President Mahmoud Abbas will head an interim unity government to prepare for general elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Mr Abbas and Khaled Mashaal, head of the Islamic militant group Hamas, said they would move forward without delay, although it appears unlikely elections can be held in May, as initially envisioned. The agreement, brokered by Qatar, seemed to bring reconciliation within reach for the first time since the rivals established separate governments, following Hamas' violent takeover of Gaza, in 2007. Making history? Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (left) shakes hands with Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal (right) as the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, looks on, after signing an agreement today . Pen is mightier than the sword: President Abbas will head an interim unity government to prepare for general elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip . Previous deals have collapsed amid deep suspicions and intervention by the sides' rival foreign patrons. Mr Abbas is backed by the West while Hamas has been supported by Iran. Mr Abbas and Mr Mashaal had reached a reconciliation deal last year, but disagreement over who was to head an interim government had delayed implementation. Hamas strongly opposed Mr Abbas' choice of Salam Fayyad, the head of his Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. It remains unclear whether an Abbas-led interim government that is supported by Hamas would be acceptable to the West, which gives hundreds of millions of dollars of aid to the Palestinians each year. The U.S., Europe and Israel consider Hamas a terror organisation, and said they would shun any government that includes members of an unreformed Hamas. Mr Abbas has international backing and Monday's agreement said all Cabinet ministers would be politically independent technocrats. Mr Fayyad, who would have to step down if a transitional government is formed, said he welcomed the agreement. It was not announced when the caretaker government would take office. Monday's breakthrough came after two days of meetings between Mr Abbas and Mr Mashaal, hosted by Qatar's emir, Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. The two Palestinian leaders signed the agreement in a small ceremony at the emir's diwan - or meeting hall - in Doha. Compromise: Mr Abbas (left) and Mr Meshaal (right) arrive to sign the agreement in Doha . After the signing, Mr Abbas said: 'We promise our people to implement this agreement as soon as possible.' Mr Mashaal added: 'We inform our people that we are serious about healing the wounds... to reunite our people on the foundation of a political partnership, in order to devote our effort to resisting the (Israeli) occupation.' The agreement also calls for rebuilding Gaza, which has been largely cut off from the world as part of an Israeli-Egyptian border blockade, imposed after the Hamas takeover in 2007. The blockade was eased in the past year, but not enough to revive the Gazan economy, including the vital construction industry, and many large-scale projects remain on hold. The Qatari leader urged the Arab world to stand behind the Palestinians' 'historical rights', in an apparent reference for full statehood and return of lands occupied by Israel in the 1967 war. The Arab world may have to step in if the West refuses to work with an Abbas-led interim government. The Palestinian Authority currently receives about $1billion a year for its budget in foreign aid, and that money could be halted if the international community deems a new Palestinian government unacceptable. With the Palestinians moving toward unity, the fate of low-level border talks with Israel also remains uncertain. Mediator: Mr Abbas (left) and Mr Mashaal (right) meet the Crown Prince of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad . Mr Abbas has said that the talks have run their course, as far as he is concerned, and that he would only resume them if Israel made a better offer on where to draw the border with a Palestinian state. It is not clear whether Israel would negotiate with Mr Abbas as head of a Palestinian unity government. Israeli officials had no immediate comment today. Mr Abbas and Hamas have had bitter ideological differences, with Mr Abbas pursuing a deal with Israel on the terms of Palestinian statehood and the violently anti-Israel Hamas dismissing such talks as a waste of time. In recent months, those differences seem to have narrowed. Mr Abbas has lost faith in reaching a deal, at least with the current hardline Israeli government, while Mr Mashaal has been prodding Hamas towards a more pragmatic stance that is closer to that of the group's parent movement, the pan-Arab Muslim Brotherhood. However, Mr Mashaal represents Hamas in exile and appears to have had differences with the movement's local leadership in Gaza. Some of the Gaza leaders have resisted his push for reconciliation with Mr Abbas and moving closer to the Brotherhood, Hamas officials have said privately. Still, Hamas' prime minister in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, welcomed the Doha deal, and a delegation from Gaza was present during Monday's signing. Analysts said they believed this deal stood a chance where others had failed. Majid Sweilim, a political analyst in the West Bank, said: 'There are several indications that this agreement is a serious one, and can be implemented. 'The president at the helm of the government means it will be accepted by the West. The Qatari sponsorship means it's accepted by the West and will be funded by this wealthy Gulf state. 'President Abbas is very interested in ending the split, particularly with the failure of the peace talks, and Khaled Mashaal is getting closer to the PLO position, in harmony with the changes of the Muslim Brotherhoods in the region.'","Brokered by Qatar, Mr Abbas and Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal now plan to move towards staging general elections within months ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:24 PM on 6th February 2012 . The woman accused of stalking New York Yankees general manager Brian Cashman pretended to be pregnant with his baby, her mother claims. After Louise Neathway told her ex-lover Mr Cashman of her claim and threatened to air it publicly, he gave her $6,000 to have an abortion. But her mother later told him that she had invented the claim - and said it was not the first time she had lied about having an abortion, according to the New York Post. Mr Cashman, 44, appeared under strain over the weekend when he visited his wife, who is filing for divorce in the wake of his alleged affair with Ms Neathway. Accused: Louise Neathway is said to have made up a claim that she was pregnant with her ex-lover's baby . A sad state of affairs: Looking tired and unhappy, Brian Cashman drives away from his house in Norwalk, Connecticut on Saturday . But he may have received some relief . from the revelation that Ms Neathway, 36, was never in fact pregnant - . despite demanding $15,000 for an 'unspecified medical issue'. The Yankees boss was told that this claim was false during a meeting on January 27 with Ms Neathway's mother Caroline Meanwell. Ms Meanwell 'apologised to [Mr Cashman] for all the trouble and was very emotional,' according to a source for the Post. 'She said [Ms Neathway] was never pregnant, and had lied about it in the past as well. 'She said she had made [previous] claims of fake pregnancies and fake abortions.' Louise Neathway, pictured right in court, claimed that Yankees boss . Brian Cashman, left, got her pregnant and made her have an abortion . Pregnancy scare: Ms Neathway emailed Mr Cashman a photo of an ultrasound, pictured, telling him to pay for her 'abortion' or she would continue to torment him . On that same day, Ms Neathway sent Mr . Cashman a message about her alleged pregnancy and attached what she . said was an ultrasound scan of their baby. The trove of emails sent to Mr . Cashman and his lawyer by Ms Neathway, who who has been charged with . stalking and harrassing the father of two, was obtained by the Daily . News. 'What Brian Cashman has done to me is . both incomprehensible and unforgivable,' Ms Neathway reportedly wrote . in an email sent with the scan on January 29. 'I am going to the press and . informaing [sic] them of the preganacy [sic] and the abortion. And . everything else,' she wrote in an error-littered message. 'So you can have a little gloat at my . agony here is my ultra sound picture. . . I guess its ok for me to just . push this aside right? Men!!!' Yankees boss Brian Cashman's wife has filed for a divorce after he was publicly accused of the affair with Neathway . Ms Neathway, in a separate email sent . a day later, threatened to make Mr Cashman’s life hell unless he paid . for her 'abortion'. She also warned that any threats against her would . backfire, claiming she worked for British intelligence agency MI6. 'I will not tolerate threats by any . means, of a criminal nature, as that will bite Brian in the backside and . probably will be the biggest personal mistake of his life,' wrote the . mother of one, according to the Daily News. Mr Cashman's wife Mary, 42, filed for . divorce a day after Ms Neathway faced her charges in court on Thursday . claiming to have had an affair with him. When the baseball manager visited his . wife at their Darien home he spent less than a minute in the house, . which he moved out of when the claims first emerged. Scruffily dressed and with dark rings under his eyes from lack of sleep, the pressure was clearly showing. Mr Cashman is the latest in a line of . men who claim Ms Neathway has tormented them with death threats, phone . hacking and lies about miscarriages and abortions, court records and . former friends claim. Extra threat: Neathway warned Cashman in her last email that any threats against her would backfire claiming she worked for British intelligence agency MI6 . On Thursday prosecutors said Ms . Neathway harassed Mr Cashman with hundreds of text messages, and . demanded he give her $15,000 to pay for a medical procedure. She allegedly threatened to contact . the press and his family with claims that would hurt his personal . relationships and professional standing, according to a court complaint. Mr Cashman made two payments, one for $4,000 and another for $2,000. He even tried to get rid of his alleged mistress by urging her mother to have her committed, sources told the Daily News. He apparently contacted Ms Meanwell last week and told her that her daughter was mentally unstable and 'needs help'. The call led to a meeting between Ms Meanwell, Mr Cashman and his lawyer. Prior accusations: Mr Cashman is not the first man to accuse her of stalking and making threats . 'He told the mother she needed help,' one of the sources said. 'He suggested to her that she try to have her committed.' In the meeting, Mr Cashman and Ms . Meanwell placed a conference call to Louise’s Manhattan psychiatrist, . Charlotte Murphy, who agreed with Cashman, sources told the Post. 'Murphy agreed that Louise was dangerous and violent, and that it was a serious situation. She said to call 911,' a source said. Ms Meanwell made the call which eventually led to her daughter's arrest. Mr Cashman claims he was stalked and blackmailed into handing over $6,000 to Louise Neathway . Cashman is the latest in the line of men who claim Neathway has tormented them with death threats, phone hacking and lies about miscarriages . The Daily News also obtained a reference letter Mr Cashman wrote for Ms Neathway on Yankees-letterhead paper. In the letter dated July 15, 2011, Mr . Cashman said that he had known her for six years through charity work . and described her as 'tireless' contributor who had the 'respect and . admiration' of her colleagues. In court Ms Neathway's lawyers said . Mr Cashman was 'a married man having an inappropriate relationship' with . Neathway, a medical sales worker, and he turned on her when it 'ended . badly'. She is also reported to have claimed . to several friends that she had a year-long affair with Mr Cashman which . she ended after he did not fulfill a promise to leave his wife.

"By . Keith Gladdis . Last updated at 11:09 PM on 6th February 2012 . Quick exit: Redknapp is seen leaving the court at the end of yesterday's proceedings. He had hoped to attend his team's league match with Liverpool but his flight was cancelled . Harry Redknapp and his former chairman were compared to Hollywood's 'odd couple' yesterday as the tax evasion case against them was branded 'repugnant.' The Tottenham manager and Milan Mandaric were compared to Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as defence barrister Lord Ken Macdonald QC attacked the Crown's case. Southwark Crown Court heard the pair had an 'emotional relationship, at times a tempestuous relationship, at times a love-hate relationship.' Lord Macdonald said there were times when former Portsmouth chairman Mandaric 'loved Harry' and other times when he wanted to 'strangle him.' They are an 'odd couple, different men, different backgrounds... but I would suggest a deep affection' Lord Macdonald said. 'Mr Mandaric had no fear describing his emotions towards Mr Redknapp, he said he loves them.' They are an 'odd couple, a bit like the old film' he added. Mandaric, 73, is accused of making two payments totalling more than £189,000 to Redknapp between 2002 and 2004 as bonuses when he was manager of Portsmouth FC. It is claimed the pair attempted to avoid taxes by having the money paid into Redknapp's off shore Monaco bank account named Rosie 47 after his pet bulldog. Both men deny the charges. Redknapp's defence barrister John Kelsey-Fry QC also attacked the prosecution case saying 'there is an inherent absurdity that shrieks out at you.' He questioned why the prosecution had branded Redknapp, 64, 'greedy' when he had turned down a payment of £130,000 when he left Portsmouth. And he ridiculed claims Redknapp was a 'hard headed businessman' after the court heard evidence of his 'disastrous' financial investments. Mr Kelsey-Fry then attacked the 'crucial lynchpin' of the prosecution case, a recorded interview with News of the World journalist Rob Beasley. Odd couple: Defence barrister Lord Ken Macdonald QC compared Mandaric, left and Redknapp to characters from a film, saying there was a 'deep affection' between the two men . In the recording made in February 2009 Redknapp says the first payment of £93,100 was a bonus for the sale of the player Peter Crouch. Mr Kelsey-Fry said the Crown was relying on the 'primarily despicable' evidence gathered for a newspaper 'front page'. Business dealings: Lord Macdonald told the court about Mandaric's deals with high profile figures such as late Apple boss Steve Jobs, claiming Jobs 'would not work with fools' Mr Kelsey-Fry said: 'I do not shrink from suggesting to you it is repugnant to all our basic instincts of fairness in the criminal justice process.' Referring to interviews carried out Mr Beasley in February 2009, Mr Kelsey-Fry said: 'They saw a great story, all's fair in love and war and the News of the World.' Mr Kelsey-Fry also claimed there was a flurry of bets made on Redknapp being sacked in the days before the News of the World eventually published allegations against him and Mandaric in October 2009. He also said odds betting odds for Redknapp being the next Premier League manager to be sacked plunged from 50-1 to evens on the Friday before the story was published on the Sunday. Earlier in the day Lord Macdonald highlighted Mandaric's multi-billion pound business dealings with high profile figures such as the late boss of Apple Steve Jobs. 'Steve Jobs doesn't work with fools' the former Director of Public Prosecutions said. Lord Macdonald said it was 'desperate stuff' to suggest Mandaric would have made the second off shore payment to Redknapp just days after increasing the value of his contract from £3m to £4.2m. He said: 'Why would he follow up a £1.18m increase with an additional $150,000?' Lord Macdonald said that while $150,000 (£96,300) was a large sum to most people Mandaric was 'inhabiting a universe where the perspective is different.' He told jurors not to let the fact of the two men's wealth escape them. Support: Redknapp is seen outside court following the evidence with his son Jamie . The (original) Odd Couple: Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau in the 1968 classic . Mr Kelsey-Fry detailed the bonuses in Redknapp's contract relating to achieving promotion to the Premier League and maintaining Pompey's top flight status. He said Redknapp gained a £300,000 rise in his basic salary from £500,000 to £800,000 when he secured promotion in 2003 along with a £400,000 bonus. Redknapp was also contracted to get a further £200,000 for securing the Premier League staus of Portsmouth in 2004 along with ten per cent of the club's Merit Award of £4,360,000. Mr Kelsey-Fry said it would 'offend common sense' for Redknapp to have paid tax on profit related bonuses of around £1.5m and then refuse to pay tax on a further £100,000. The case continues.","Defence barrister suggests a 'deep affection' between the two men .

"By . Jason Groves . Last updated at 11:23 PM on 6th February 2012 . Network Rail bosses were yesterday shamed into giving up bonus payments worth up to £1.4million. The decision follows a ferocious public backlash against plans which could have seen the taxpayer-funded firm’s six executive directors share a total of £20million by 2015. Last week Network Rail was forced to apologise after it admitted health and safety breaches over the deaths of two teenage girls at a level crossing in 2005. Unprecedented step: Transport Secretary . Justine Greening had planned to attend the Network Rail members' meeting . on Friday  to shame executives, such as chief Sir David Higgins, into . giving . up their bonuses . It said yesterday that its executive . directors would hand any bonuses they received this year –which are . expected to total up to £1.4million – to a ‘safety fund’ to improve . level crossings. The firm – which receives £4billion a year from the public purse to run the rail network – also said it would rethink plans for a long-term bonus scheme that could hand the directors up to £15.6million over the next three years. Taken with their annual bonus payments over that time, the bonuses could have totalled £20million by 2015. The climbdown came after Transport . Secretary Justine Greening threatened to gatecrash a meeting on Friday . that had been set to rubber-stamp the bonus package. Yesterday the firm said the meeting had been shelved while it ‘reflected’ on the level of bonuses it should offer. The directors on the Network Rail board were each entitled to bonus payments of up to 60 per cent of their salary this year - which could have been worth £1,392,000. The discretionary payouts are dependent on performance targets being hit - but chief-executive Sir David Higgins could have pocketed £336,000 - on top of his £560,000 basic salary. In total, the generous bonus package could have been worth £20million to the board between now and 2015. Under complicated arrangements, the directors receive both 'short-term' annual bonuses and 'long-term' bonuses. A spokesman for Network Rail said a new incentives package for subsequent years will now have to be agreed. Given the pressure being exerted by the Government to cut executive pay, in future bonuses are unlikely to be anything like as extravagant. Below are the salaries each of the Network Rail Board members receives and in brackets the bonus they could have received this year. Sir David Higgins - Chief-Executive £560,000, (£336,000) Patrick Butcher - Group Finance Director £350,000, (£210,000) Robin Gisby - Director, Operations & Customer Services £330,000, (£198,000) Peter Henderson - Director, Asset Management £440,000, (£264,000) Simon Kirby - Director, Investment Projects £330,000, (£198,000) Paul Plummer £310,000, (£186,0 . Miss Greening, who described the bonus proposals as ‘unacceptable’, last night welcomed the ‘sensible’ U-turn. She said: ‘I have made it clear to Network Rail at every stage that this proposed package did not go far enough in reflecting the need for restraint. ‘The fact that its executive directors have also chosen to forfeit their annual bonuses to improve level crossings is a sign that they have recognised the strength of public opinion.’ Downing Street last night urged other organisations to ‘reflect’ on the move. The Prime Minister’s spokesman said: ‘All parts of the public sector should be reflecting on the financial environment and taking responsible decisions.’ However, Network Rail last night confirmed that it would be bringing forward new proposals for executive bonuses in the coming weeks. It issued a statement saying it would ‘take the opportunity to reflect further on how to incentivise performance in the company against the backdrop of the current context’. A spokesman said the firm had a legal duty to offer bonuses to its staff. One of the firm’s 78-strong members’ board told the Daily Mail that bonuses were being used as a substitute for pay rises. He said three directors had threatened to quit unless they received the cash. Chief executive Sir David Higgins, who is . paid a basic salary of £560,000, was in line for a £336,000 annual . bonus and a £1.8million long-term bonus. Last week he apologised on behalf of Network Rail after it admitted . health and safety breaches over the deaths of Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and . Charlotte Thompson, 13, who were hit by a train in 2005 at Elsenham . station in Essex. The directors’ decision to donate their bonuses to a safety fund was . welcomed by Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, who said: . ‘This decision is sadly too little, too late for the parents of the . girls who tragically died. ‘But we welcome it as  the first step in the direction of the directors . starting to put safety and the passengers ahead of their own handsome . rewards.’ Payout: The directors at Network Rail - who run the tracks - had been in line for payouts worth £20million . Network Rail last week admitted health and . safety breaches over the deaths of Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and Charlotte . Thompson, 13, pictured, shortly before the huge bonus for Sir David . Higgins was announced . Tory MP Anne Main, who led a Commons debate on the issue last week, . urged ministers to ensure that the firm was not able to slip through . proposals for big bonuses when public controversy about the issue dies . down. She said: ‘The original proposals were a disgrace. ‘They should be ashamed that they were even considering these massive bonuses at a time when performance is getting worse. ‘It is welcome that they are going to waive their bonuses this year, but this must not become a one-off gesture.’","Transport Secretary Justine Greening threatened to attend meeting to shame staff into abandoning bonuses .

The offer comes shortly after the manufacturer's parent company Eastman Kodak hit the headlines for filing for bankruptcy protection in the U.S.. Cut price: Asda is offering the Kodak M200 at a record low price . Kodak has not yet filed for bankruptcy in the UK. The 131-year-old group's U.S. wing collapsed after the company had just one profitable year since 2004. From 2003 the company attempted a four-year digital makeover during which it dynamited aged . factories, and eliminated tens of . thousands of jobs. But Kodak's new business ran directly into the recession, and quickly slipped into the red. The EasyShare Mini was launched last year, and is one of the company's entry-level cameras.

But they were devastated to learn the six-year-old had a terminal brain condition, featured in the film 'Lorenzo's Oil.' Now they face a terrible wait to see if his 12-year-old brother has the same condition and whether his sisters, aged 14, 15 and 23, carry the defective gene. Heartbreaking: McCauley Riley only has a few years to live due to a terminal brain condition. His parents hope to raise enough money to take him to Benidorm . McCauley was diagnosed with Adrenoleukodystrophy, which affects one in 30,000 children in the UK. The diagnosis means he has a life expectancy of between a few months and a few years. His parents, Wayne, 35, and Catherine Riley, 42, said their lives were ripped apart when they heard the diagnosis. In the three months since his diagnosis of Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), the young boy from Blackburn has lost his eyesight and is now struggling to walk. The 1992 movie Lorenzo’s Oil brought the condition to public attention, telling the story of sufferer Lorenzo Odone from Virginia, USA. Mr Riley said: 'We thought he was a normal boy with bad eyesight, but then he started walking into a lot of things. 'At school he’d walk into a wall and say other children had tripped him, but the teachers had been watching and there was no one around him. 'At that point we demanded that he had tests and it came back that his brain stems weren’t right. His genetics were pear-shaped. 'We sat in meetings for hours with specialists and I asked what the cure was. The man said there was none, and we were blown apart. 'I’d never heard of the condition, and it seems nobody else has. They do loads of tests on newborns, and they need to do one for ALD. 'If we’d have known about McCauley’s condition then, he might have been able to have a bone marrow transplant that would have given him a better lease of life till he was in his 20s. Having that now would kill him.' McCauley suffers from the same condition as depicted in the Oscar-winning film Lorenzo's Oil from 1992 and starring Susan Sarandon (pictured) Mccauley’s 12-year-old brother will be tested to see if he has the same condition, as it only affects males and symptoms can start later in life. McCauley was taken to Lapland to meet Father Christmas in December, courtesy of a well wisher. The Make a Wish Foundation have also organised a family trip to Florida in March and Blackburn Rovers players have met McCauley and presented him with signed shirts and a ball. Now collections have begun around Blackburn to pay for McCauley to have more treats, including a longed-for holiday in Benidorm. He also wants to meet the cast of the ITV comedy named after the Spanish resort. Wayne said: 'Since the diagnosis he has deteriorated very quickly. He’s now registered blind and is struggling to walk. 'He can make out images very close to his eyes, so we’re hoping he will be able to see the dolphins close up and remember them. 'Whatever he wants, he’s got. Not in a spoilt way, but because we want him to be able to enjoy himself and be as normal as possible while he can. 'He’s shy, but is a very strong-willed little boy. The doctor’s thought he’d be in a wheelchair by now and being carried around, but he’s still walking by himself and he’s still going to school. 'The other night he wanted to go out on his scooter, and we let him, because you can’t wrap him up in cotton wool.' His mother Catherine, a care worker for the elderly, said: 'He still plays rough with his brother and sisters and we try to carry on as normal. 'The school have been amazing to him and insisted he stayed there with his friends and in familiar surroundings, rather than being put in a special school.' ALD is an inherited recessive genetic disorder linked to the X chromosome. The disorder leaves the body unable to break down fat molecules, which build up and damage nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. There are several forms that ALD can take. The most devastating type is the childhood cerebral form which McCauley has, meaning that nerves in the brain are destroyed. About 35 to 40 percent of all cases of ALD are this type, which usually appears between four and eight years of age in boys. Those affected will usually become totally disabled in six months to two years, and die sometime after. Catherine said: 'My message to other parents is to be aware of whether their child is bumping into things or losing co-ordination, because it could be the symptoms of ALD. 'More people need to know about this, and they need to know about it sooner rather than later so there’s more medical options available. 'If someone suspects their child is ill, they must demand blood tests and scans. Don’t take no for an answer.'","McCauley, 6, has lost his eyesight and is now struggling to walk ."

The heartbreaking story of a woman who was told her solider fiance had been killed in Afghanistan on Valentine's Day has today emerged. Hayley Fisk had been excited to receive a Valentine's Day card from Paratrooper Kyle Marshall last year. But her joy soon turned to heartache after soldiers arrived at her door to tell her the 24-year-old from Howdon, North Tyneside, had been killed after stepping on an explosive planted by the Taliban. Today the soldier's father Gary has spoken of the family's ongoing grief as his first anniversary approaches. The 47-year-old's had taken charge of his squadron  for just a matter of minutes before he was killed in Helmand Province on February 14 last year. Tragic: Hayley Fisk, right, was delighted to receive a Valentine's Day card from soldier fiance Kyle Marshall, left, but joy turned to heartbreak when moments later, she was told he had been killed in Afghanistan . Just before his death, he had discovered a huge explosives factory and had helped airlift a comrade to safety after coming under attack. Mr Marshall, a taxi driver said how his daughter-in-law-to-be Hayley had not been able to sleep the night before his son died. 'She phoned in sick to work and that morning she got a Valentine’s Day card through the letterbox,'' Mr Marshall said. 'She said she sat down and then she saw two figures at the door.' Mr Marshall had been transferring money into Kyle's account for his wedding when the soldiers knocked at his door. 'They knocked and came in and I just said, ""He’s dead isn’t he?"" Mr Marshall said. 'I went numb. I put my head in my hands and I said, ""They’ve killed my boy""'. Mr Marshall, who is separated from his son's mother, Olwyn, said telling her was 'one of the worst things I've ever had to do.' 'How do you tell a woman her son has been killed?,' he said. Hero: Paratrooper Marshall had just led his squadron to find what is believed to be the biggest explosives factory in Afghanistan before he was killed, ironically, by an explosive planted by the Taliban . Mr Marshall had seen his son 12 days before he was killed. The Paratrooper had just bought a house with Miss Fisk after moving to a base in Colchester and the pair had planned to tie the knot on June 30 last year. 'Some days are better than others,' Mr Marshall said. 'Hayley puts on a brave face for me and I do . the same for her. You will never forget though. He was not just my son, he was my best mate. We did all sorts together. 'He loved sport and we used to go to Newcastle United games together. Even when he moved to Colchester we used to go to the odd game. 'His mates in the Army called him the loud Geordie. He was always playing tricks and if there was any fun to be had he was at the centre of it. 'But as soon as he was on patrol he was completely switched on and he used to . look after the young soldiers,' he added. Return: Despite being offered 'double his wages' if he stayed at a Tyneside tile store, paratrooper Marshall felt like 'he had unfinished business,' his father Gary said, so returned to the Army . Paratrooper Marshall had joined the Army when he was 16 and did his basic training in Harrogate before going to work at Ceramic Tile Distributors in Tyneside. But despite being offered 'double his wages' if he stayed at the tile store, paratrooper Marshall decided to return to what he loved. 'He felt like he hadn’t completed something, like he had unfinished business,' his father said. The 24-year-old was on his second tour of duty when he was killed. He had been part of an intelligence-gathering patrol which had just discovered what is believed to be the largest factory in Afghanistan, according to an inquest. During the mission Paratrooper Marshall's squadron had come under fire three times. When his corporal was wounded he had taken charge. Images of his final movements were captured on a camera strapped to his helmet, but his family have not yet seen the footage. Another member of the team - standing just yards from Paratrooper Marshall - suffered horrific . burns to his body and was airlifted to hospital for lifesaving treatment. 'There’s no doubt discovering the factory saved many lives, but it’s still heartbreaking that he was killed,' Mr Marshall said. 'Kyle wanted to be there and we just had to let him go.'","Paratrooper's father speaks of the family's ongoing grief as his first anniversary approaches .

State school students with straight A grades are less likely to win places at Oxford University than privately educated pupils, it has emerged. Applicants from fee-paying schools with top grades were around 25 per cent more likely to get into the world-famous seat of learning than academic candidates from elsewhere. The figures released under the Freedom of Information act will come as a disappointment after the Government put pressure on top universities to ensure they took in students from a range of backgrounds. Admissions issues: Last year's figures are disappointing after the Government put pressure on Oxford to take more students from a range of backgrounds .

Only 23 per cent of those with the same grades from state schools were accepted, however, according to figures seen by the Daily Telegraph. Among the 3,888 white pupils with A grades who applied last year, 28 per cent were offered places, but just 20 per cent of black African students got in - 13 of 67.

Backlash: Elly Nowell sent a mocking 'rejection letter' to Magdalen College last month, saying Oxford was not up to her standards . Magdalen was at the centre of a row in 2000, when academics refused a place to Laura Spence, a former comprehensive pupil with five As at A level, in what Gordon Brown called 'an absolute disgrace.' Last year, Nick Clegg accused Oxford and Cambridge of being effectively biased against poor pupils, saying they had to ensure 'British society is better reflected' in their admissions to justify state funding. But the university insisted that white pupils were more than twice as likely as black pupils to gain three A grades at A-level and pointed out that privately educated teenagers account for a third of those gaining straight As, despite making up just 14 per cent of entries. A spokeswoman said: 'Two candidates from different school backgrounds who have performed the same in all aspects of the selection system would have the same chance of getting a place, regardless of their school. 'Selection is not based solely on A-level results. Two people with same A-level results will have different GCSE results, perform differently on pre-interview aptitude tests, and show different potential in interview.'","Figures shows just 23% of state school children with three As at AS Level who applied were admitted .

France and Germany has controversially told Greece it should place state revenues into a separate fund so it can pay off its crushing debt - to avoid bankruptcy and prevent the crash of the single currency. French President Nicolas Sarkozy told a Paris news conference, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, that Greece's new leaders must also 'take their responsibility'. The pair, dubbed Merkozy for their close co-operation in recent months, also said that that any new bailout will require taking decisions to reduce debt. The comments, which are likely to provoke anger in Greece, came after the 14th French-German Council of Ministers, which focused on co-ordinating the countries' tax policies as well as Europe's debt crisis.

Controversial: French President Nicolas Sarkozy (right) told a Paris news conference, alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel, (left) that Greece should place state revenues into a separate fund so it can pay off its crushing debt . Last-gasp: Can Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos get his coalition government to agree to the IMF deal? It also came as Greece was today due to make a last-ditch attempt to stave off bankruptcy, in a bid to stop sending the eurozone into economic chaos which could ultimately bring down the single currency. Parties backing the country's coalition government will meet again to try and secure an austerity deal with rescue creditors. It follows an intense weekend of negotiations which failed to produce a breakthrough. Prime Minister Lucas Papademos will meet leaders of three parties backing his coalition, who all publicly oppose steep cuts in private sector pay demanded by negotiators representing eurozone lenders and the International Monetary Fund. The new 130billion euro bailout deal is vital for Greece avoid bankruptcy next month as it cannot cover a 14.5billion euro bond repayment due on March 20. Tied to that deal are plans by banks and other private bondholders to forgive 100billion euro in Greek debt in exchange for a cash payment and new bonds with more lenient repayment terms. Over the weekend, Greek officials held a conference call with eurozone finance ministers, as well as exhaustive rounds of talks in Athens with EU-IMF debt inspectors, senior bank negotiators, and Greek political party leaders, to try and hammer out a deal. An announcement from Papademos' office said agreement had been reached to cut 2012 spending by 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product - about 3.3billion euro. They had also agreed to improve competitiveness by slashing wages and non-wage costs, and re-capitalising banks without nationalizing them. But the three coalition backers - . Socialist George Papandreou, Conservative Antonis Samaras and George . Karatzaferis of the rightist LAOS party - differed as to what this would . mean in detailed proposals. Critical: The new 130billion euro bailout deal is vital for Greece avoid bankruptcy next month as it cannot cover a 14.5billion euro bond repayment due on March 20 . 'We are in the middle of a major struggle. Right now, the developments are satisfactory,' said Karatzaferis. He added that EU-IMF negotiators had . backed away from a demand to axe annual salary instalments given to . Greek workers as holiday bonuses. Rescue lenders have also called for firings in Greece's large public sector, a drop in the 750 euro gross minimum monthly wage, and cuts in lump-sum retirement payouts, as part of a long list of cost-cutting demands. Unions and employers' associations oppose the wage cuts, arguing it would worsen a recession in its fourth year and unemployment, already at around 19 per cent. The speculation and rising fears saw European markets all start the week down. The FTSE-100 opened 0.26 per cent down at 5,885.60; France's CAC 40 is 0.74 per cent down at 3,402.48; and Germany's DAX is 0.28 per cent down at 6,747.52. Left wing opposition parties are also today planning two separate protest rallies in central Athens at 6pm against the proposed cuts. Debt levels in bailed-out countries Greece, Portugal and Ireland continued to rise in the third quarter of last year. But they fell for Italy and the 17-nation eurozone as a whole, official statistics showed today.Greece's debt level was highest, spiking to 159.1 per cent of gross domestic product and suggesting that repeated austerity cuts have yet to turn the country's finances around. Despite the deterioration in the weakest members, overall debt in the eurozone fell to 87.4 per cent of GDP from 87.7 per cent in the second quarter, thanks mainly to improvements in the biggest economies like Germany and France. Investors will take heart from the Eurostat figures showing debt stabilised in both Italy and Spain, the two economies seen as the next shakiest members of the currency union. Italy managed to bring its debt down to 119.6 per cent from 121.2 per cent the previous quarter. However, at 1.88 trillion euro, its debt in nominal terms is still massive. Spain's debt remained constant at 66 per cent of GDP between the second and third quarters, although it was up from just 58.7 per cent a year earlier. The third-quarter figures give some hope that the eurozone may be able to contain the crisis to the three, relatively small countries it has already bailed out.","France and Germany tell Greece it has to 'take responsibility'

Venezuela's left-wing president has raised the stakes over the Falkland Islands by pledging his armed forces would fight alongside Argentina in any conflict with Britain. The inflammatory promise from Hugo Chavez came in the run-up to the 30th anniversary of the April 1982 invasion of the islands by Argentina. At the same time, Foreign Secretary William Hague insisted the deployment of a British warship and Prince William to the Falklands was ‘entirely routine’. Fighting talk: Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez (left) said he would back Argentina while William Hague (right) said the deployment was 'entirely routine' Mr Chavez was speaking at a meeting of the left-leaning ALBA bloc, an alliance of eight South American and Caribbean countries, which backed Argentina in its long-running dispute with Britain over the islands. Argentina calls the islands Las Malvinas and claims they were ‘stolen’ by Britain 180 years ago. ‘The issue of the Malvinas Islands is an issue that concerns us, especially with the strong language that has emerged from the British Government, accusing Argentina of being colonialist,’ Mr Chavez said at the meeting in Caracas. ‘I’m speaking only for Venezuela, but if it occurs to the British empire to attack Argentina, Argentina won’t be alone this time.’ Controversy: Prince William's planned visit to the Falklands has upset Argentina . The ALBA countries approved an agreement barring any boats flying Falkland Islands flags from docking in their ports. The member countries are Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, Cuba, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Nicaragua, and St Vincent and the Grenadines. Argentina hopes diplomatic and economic measures will pressure Britain to comply with United Nations resolutions encouraging both countries to negotiate the islands’ sovereignty. British leaders have refused to do that, insisting the islanders have the right to self-determination. Emotions have heightened recently with the deployment of Prince William, a Royal Air Force helicopter pilot, to the islands on a military tour along with a warship ahead of the 30th anniversary of the ten-week Falklands War in which 255 members of the British forces died, along with three Falkland Islanders and 649 Argentines. But Mr Hague said the deployments were routine as he revealed that commemorations would go ahead to mark the anniversary of the conflict. ‘The events are not so much celebrations as commemorations,’ he said. ‘I think Argentina will also be holding commemorations of those who died in the conflict. ‘Since both countries will be doing that, I don’t think there is anything provocative about that. Nor is there anything provocative about entirely routine military movements. ‘They are entirely routine – our ships regularly visit the South Atlantic. We will resist the diplomatic efforts of Argentina to raise the temperature on this.’ Disputed: Argentina calls the Falkland Islands (pictured) Las Malvinas and claims they were 'stolen' by Britain 180 years ago .","Inflammatory promise comes in run-up to 30th anniversary of 1982 conflict .

However, US District judge Lucy Koh has insisted that users should be entitled to some gain from commercial endorsements that stem if someone chooses to 'like' a certain product or interest on the site. Whilst the case against the popular site has yet to be heard, Koh added that such a claim 'present novel issues of state law for which . there is no binding authority.' All change: The company recently introduced a new timeline feature that further exposes people's interests . The company have only just settled a previous complaint by the US Federal Trade Commission over privacy issues, after it was alleged that they made promises to keep consumers information on Facebook private, only to later allowing the data to be shared and made public. Facebook had so far refused to make a comment with the investigation to continue.","'Like' button could be illegal under Californian law .

Thousands of Marines stormed the beaches of Virginia and North Carolina last night in the largest amphibious training exercise for a decade. Troops from the U.S., UK, Canada, France, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Australia took part in the massive military operation near Camp Lejeune, North Carolina and Virginia Beach. The night exercise, known as Bold Alligator, pitched Marines from international forces in a fictional, friendly country called Amberland whose neighbour, Amber, had been invaded by Garnet. Storm: Marines help to move an artillery piece after landing on a beach near Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, during the Bold Alligator exercise . Operation: Amphibious assault vehicles storm the shore after driving off the USS Oak Hill during the war games exercise . Cooperation: French vehicles and troops land from a LCAT transport catamaran as the operation gets underway . Fast response: A Navy LCAC hovercraft lands on the beach in Camp Lejeune as the simulated amphibious assault swings into action . The Garnet army was rapidly advancing northward along the coast to Wilmington, North Carolina, seizing its port and airport and the forces have been asked to halt the advance. Nearly 30 ships and 20,000 service personnel have been taking part in the exercise as military leaders attempt to provide a more realistic scenario for how amphibious landings could be conducted in future. A new approach to the landings involves more reliance on allies and friendly countries, including making decisions on whether to stage ships in port or out to sea because of the potential disruption to a host nation's economy. Military: A Sikorsky Super Stallion Iron Horse helicopter takes off from the USS Wasp as eight countries took part in the largest amphibious assault for a decade . New war: French troops prepare to storm a 'terrorist encampment' after the fictional country of Amber was invaded by Garnet. Right, U.S. Marines wait to board a helicopter which will bring them into the action . Kitted out: U.S. Marines board two helicopters as the initial landing stage of a week of war games exercises began yesterday . Mission: Another vehicle carrying troops rolls off the hovercraft . Naval assault: The USS Wasp discharges LCAC hovercraft as it stages operations off the coast of North Carolina . Duties: Two soldiers clean weapons on their AAVP7 assault vehicle on board the USS Wasp . The week's exercises have been in the planning stages for several years, and they take place days before President Barack Obama will submit his defence budget proposal to Congress. Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Jonathan Greenert, said: 'We didn't put Bold Alligator together to send a message to Congress, but there may be, you know, there's always second-order effects.' Marines travelling on hovercraft from the USS New York landed at Fort Story - a military base along Virginia Beach. After unloading equipment, they moved 2.5 miles to raid a mock terrorist training camp as gunfire, pyrotechnics and noise filled the night air. Scale: Troops carriers drive along the beach after making landfall as 20,000 service personnel, including Marines, sailors and air staff, take part in the operation . Forward look: Seaman Opoku calls out sightings on board the USS Wasp in the Atlantic Ocean . Might: A crew members makes checks as a helicopter takes off carrying Marines . Exercise: A U.S. Navy landing craft lands in the dock of French ship Mistral to load equipment . Getting wet: Amphibious vehicles, with a soldier manning the guns, drive out of the surf with other warships in the background . Drilled: An LCAC hovercraft goes back for another load of troops and equipment after making shore . Once clear, 'killed' enemy combatants were searched for intelligence, civilians were evacuated and a booby-trapped weapons cache was blown up before the Marines returned to their ship. Marines have been fighting wars in landlocked countries like Iraq and Afghanistan for years, and many have never even set foot on a Navy ship. This is of particular concern as the military shifts its strategic focus towards coastal regions, including Iran, North Korea and China, which are drawing increasing attention from the U.S. As part of the U.S. Defense Department's budget proposal, some ships will be retired earlier than expected while the purchase of others is being delayed. Intelligence: Trucks prepare to drive off the Navy LCAC after it made landfall. The week of exercises will also see Marines storm a fort from the air . Time to move? A French Navy sailor watches as a U.S. hovercraft docks in the hold . Night fighting: An amphibious assault vehicle drives ashore as the sun sets in North Carolina . Discipline: A U.S. sailor monitors his radar equipment and, right, French soldiers cover each other as they carry out a patrol on land . Equipment: Weapons, helmets and binoculars sit on the deck as Marines prepare to disembark . Plans: A Netherlands Lieutenant Commander explains details of the mission to sailors . Amphibious assaults were common during World War Two, most notably when Allied troops staged the Normandy landings in German-occupied France in 1944, as well as numerous landings on islands in the Pacific. Since then, such landings have become far more rare. The U.S. Navy is concerned about developing an amphibious mindset and a memo last year urged every sailor in the Atlantic Fleet to read doctrine on amphibious operations as well as three books on the 1982 conflict between the UK and Argentina over the Falkland Islands. Later on this week, the international forces will stage an aerial assault and insertion of Marine launched from sea on Fort Pickett, Virginia.","20,000 troops from eight countries take part in massive amphibious landing exercise in North Carolina and Virginia .

The unnamed teenager went under the knife when staff at New York Downtown Hospital in Manhattan did not spend enough time checking to see if she was expecting. The procedure, which took place in 2007, appears to have been halted soon after it began - but five years on the patient still does not know the truth. Scroll down for video . Claims: The story emerged in an unfair dismissal hearing by Dr Suarna Mehulic who says she was fired from a hospital for exposing dangerous practices . A hospital spokesman has vehemently denied that the bungled procedure took place and has called such claims ‘egregious and inflammatory' The story emerged in an unfair dismissal hearing brought by Dr Suarna Mehulic who says she was fired from the hospital for exposing dangerous practices at its Obstetrics and Gynecological department. It was first reported by NBC New York. During depositions Dr Mehulic's former colleague Dr Lana Boter was asked by one of the plaintiff’s lawyers: ‘Was there an occasion when a C-section was performed on a patient at the hospital who was not pregnant? Dr Boter replied: ‘There was. Operation: The teenager went under the knife when staff at New York Downtown Hospital in Manhattan did not spend enough time seeing if she was expecting . ‘A little extra time would have shown that there was no pregnancy at all.’ She added that she was not directly involved in the patient’s care but was on the hospital’s Quality Assurance Committee which oversees standards. 'A little extra time would have shown that there was no pregnancy at all' Dr Lana Boter . Dr Mehulic’s lawyers asked another medic, Dr Anca Rosa: ‘Was there a C-section on a patient who was not pregnant?’ Dr Rosa replied: ‘Yes. Turns out she wasn’t pregnant.’ She added that ‘nobody cut into the uterus to do a C-section’ but that some surgery did take place. Dr Rosa also explained that she performed a sonogram on the patient but midway through handed over to an attending physician and left the room before any surgery was started. Testimony: Dr Mehulic's lawyers asked another medic, Dr Anca Rosa: 'Was there a C-section on a patient who was not pregnant?' Dr Rosa replied: 'Yes' Dr Mehulic first became aware of the case a few weeks later when she treated the patient for pain in her pelvis. It quickly became apparent that the patient was still under the impression that she had been pregnant. 'When I saw her I knew that she could not have been pregnant. I did not tell her, nobody appears to have told her. She will be 20 now and has the right to know' Dr Suarna Mehulic . In an interview with MailOnline Dr Mehulic said that as far as she knew, even now the patient was unaware. She said: ‘When I saw her I knew that she could not have been pregnant. ‘I did not tell her, nobody appears to have told her. She will be 20 now and has the right to know.’ Asked how this happened in the first place, she said: ‘Nobody did a pregnancy test. I’m not sure’. Interview: Dr Lana Boter said she was giving evidence and 'I told the truth about this C-section but I had nothing to do with the rest of the case' Speaking to MailOnline Dr Boter said: ‘I was giving evidence and I told the truth about this C-section but I had nothing to do with the rest of the case.’ She also confirmed she was on the hospital’s Quality Assurance Committee at the time the incident happened. 'No C-section has ever been performed in our hospital on a woman who was not pregnant' Hospital spokesman . Nobody from the hospital was available to comment for MailOnline. According to NBC New York, executives claimed Dr Mehulic was a paranoid and overall not a good doctor and that she was fired for insubordination. A hospital spokesman told its reporter Chris Glorioso : ‘No C-section has ever been performed in our hospital on a woman who was not pregnant, and if you were to suggest otherwise it would be an egregious and inflammatory error.’ It is not clear how the girl came to be confused about her pregnancy as full details about her case have not been released by the hospital.

"By . Jill Reilly . Last updated at 11:01 AM on 7th February 2012 . Amanda Knox's Italian lawyer has filed an appeal of her slander conviction in Italy, a Knox family spokesman in Seattle yesterday. In October, an Italian appeals court overturned the young Seattle woman's murder conviction in the 2007 death of her British roommate, Meredith Kercher in Perugia. But the same court upheld Knox's conviction for slander - for falsely accusing bar owner Diya 'Patrick' Lumumba of involvement in the slaying. Attempt to clear her name: A spokesman for Amanda Knox says her Italian lawyer has filed an appeal of her slander conviction in Italy . Lumumba was held after Knox said that she vaguely 'remembered Patrick killing Meredith' and she 'covered her ears to cover the screams.' He was freed after two weeks in prison for lack of evidence. Knox later said she was 'manipulated' during her lengthy police interrogation. An appeal of the slander conviction was filed on Monday, Knox family spokesman Dave Marriott confirmed. He doesn't know when the Italian court might consider it. Knox returned to the U.S. after her murder conviction was overturned. The former exchange student had been in custody since 2007. An Italian judge set Knox's sentence for slander at three years, which was less than the time she spent in prison. That meant she could leave Italy. Freed: Knox returned to Seattle after her murder conviction was overturned. The former exchange student had been in custody since 2007 . Kercher's half-naked body was found with more than 40 stab wounds and a deep gash to the throat in the apartment she shared with Knox in Perugia. In its ruling last fall, the Italian appeals court also acquitted Knox's then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, in the murder of Kercher. A third defendant, Ivory Coast-born drifter Rudy Guede, was convicted in a separate trial of sexually assaulting and stabbing Kercher. His 16-year prison sentence - reduced on appeal from an initial 30 years - was upheld by Italy's highest court in 2010. In a lengthy court document explaining the ruling that cleared Knox and Sollecito, presiding appeals court Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellmann wrote that Knox implicated Lumumba after hours of intense police questioning because 'she was convinced that was what the police wanted her to do; to name a guilty person.' When he was released Lumumba said he would never forgive Knox, although he later publicly said that he had. In 2007 he was quoted as saying: 'I still don't understand how I finished up in all this. 'Because I'm black? Because I'm the perfect guilty one?' Since returning to the America, Knox, is living in Seattle where she has largely avoided the public eye.",Diya 'Patrick' Lumumba was freed after two weeks due to lack of evidence .
"By . Andrew Levy . Last updated at 3:55 PM on 7th February 2012 . Working hard and drinking hard is a reputation university students seem to thrive on - and Charles Dickens’ son was no different. When Henry Dickens went up to Cambridge more than 140 years ago, his illustrious father made sure he wouldn’t go thirsty. In a letter the author posted to the 19-year-old, he arranged for ‘3 Doz Sherry, 2 Doz Port and 3 Doz light claret to be sent down to you’. Not going thirsty: This letter from Charles Dickens to his son Henry promised the student copious amounts of alcohol, including '3 Doz Sherry, 2 Doz port and 3 Doz light claret to be sent down to you' A footnote added ‘6 bottles of brandy’ were also on their way to complement his undergraduate lifestyle. While today’s parents might show more concern about how much their children were drinking after leaving home for the first time, Dickens did have some fatherly advice that remains universal today. No stranger to the shame of financial woes - his own father spent time in a debtor’s prison - he sent a £250 annual allowance to his son, pointedly describing it as ‘handsome for all your wants’. He went on to warn: ‘Now, observe attentively. We must have no shadow of debt. Square up everything whatsoever that it has been necessary to buy. Helping hand: As well as the offer of alcohol and money, Charles Dickens offered a friend ear if problems arose, writing: 'If you ever find yourself on the verge of perplexity or difficulty, come to me' ‘Let not a farthing be outstanding on any account, when we begin together with your allowance. Be particular in the minutest detail.’ Dickens, who had to leave school and work ten-hour days in a warehouse, was also keen to see Henry - the eighth of his ten children - understood the opportunity he was being given by studying at one of the world’s greatest universities. ‘You know how hard I work for what I get, and I think you know that I never had money help from any human creature after I was a child,’ he wrote in the letter, which was sent in October 1868. But he also offered a friendly ear if problems arose, warmly telling his son, whom he addressed as Harry: ‘If you ever find yourself on the verge of perplexity or difficulty, come to me. ‘You will never find me hard with you while you are manly and truthful.’ The advice seems to have sunk in. After his first year Henry, a maths undergraduate, was awarded one of the principle scholarships at Trinity Hall, worth £50. Years later, Henry described movingly how his normally reserved father had broken down in tears at the news of his award and told him: ‘God bless you, my boy.’ Sadly, Dickens didn’t live to see whether his investment had paid off as he died in 1870, aged 58. Moving: Charles Dickens, left, was said to have broken down after hearing his son was given a scholarship following his first year at university, but sadly never lived to see if the investment paid off as he died in 1870 . But his son didn’t let him down. Henry graduated in 1872 was later called to the Bar after studying law at Cambridge as well. After 20 years in the Common Law Courts he became Common Serjeant of London, a senior judicial appointment at the Old Bailey that he held until 1932. The anxious tone of Dickens’ letter is a reminder of the righteous anger the novelist felt about the grinding poverty and appalling conditions that working class people lived under - and which inspired much of his work, including David Copperfield and Oliver Twist. The hand-written note was given to Trinity Hall in the 1950s by one of Dickens’ great-great grandchildren and is held in the College’s Old Library. It is rarely seen as it is only available to view by appointment but details were released to coincide with tomorrow's 200th anniversary of the author’s birth. Dr Jan-Melissa Schramm, an English Fellow at Cambridge University, said: 'Charles rescued himself from a possible life of penury and crime by the tireless efforts of his own labour. 'Thanks to the brilliant productions of his prodigious genius, his own children were to enjoy a very different - and much more stable - childhood.'

Thousands of fans roared as New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning hoisted the team's Super Bowl trophy, awarded to the NFL champions, from a glittering blue-and-white float during a victory parade through New York City. Mayor Michael Bloomberg quipped during the ceremony today that the city should now be nicknamed the 'Big Blue Apple.' The parade began at the southern tip of Manhattan and moved north to City Hall as fans were clad head-to-toe in Giants gear and confetti wafted slowly down from the high-rises lining the street. Scroll down for video . View from the top: About a million revellers gathered in New York City's Canyon of Heroes as the Giants' ticker-tape parade made its way up Broadway .

Defensive end Justin Tuck, who led the team's defense and sacked rival quarterback Tom Brady twice during the 21-17 victory over the New England Patriots, said he was glad to be part of the team. 'We made it here by believing in each other. We believe in every guy on this team,' he said. 'Honestly, we wouldn't be here today without your support.'The team was introduced at a City Hall Plaza ceremony with thunderous applause from the thousands of fans outside.

'Make it tough but make it possible,' he said, laughing about how the team blew an early lead to come back and win. The Giants had eight fourth-quarter comebacks to win games during the season. 'Finish games, finish fourth quarters and finish the season strong. That's what we did,' Manning said. The team was introduced with thunderous applause from the lucky 250 fans who got tickets to a ceremony at City Hall Plaza, where the Giants were honoured with symbolic keys to the city. Mayor Bloomberg reminded the cheering crowd that this was the second Super Bowl championship parade for the Giants in four years.

Coughlin said the Giants were successful because they never gave up. 'The key thing was to remember this: All things are possible for those who believe,' Coughlin said. 'We always believed.' The White House says Obama called Coughlin this morning and told the Giants coach that his team's victory was a testament to his leadership. Obama told Coughlin he looks forward to welcoming the Giants to the White House. Sports champions are traditionally honored with a ceremony at the White House.

Meet and greet: Giants safety Antrel Rolle celebrates with fans during the ticker-tape parade as the team made its way north on Broadway to City Hall . Some fans waited since 6am to catch a glimpse of their favorite players. About half of a Long Island high school class skipped school to see 'a whole nation coming together in one place - this parade,' said Mike King, 16, of Wantagh, N.Y. King and seven school friends got up at dawn, arriving by subway in lower Manhattan to join the crowds packed behind police barricades lining Broadway. He attributed the win to Manning's stellar performance and the hold-your-breath catch by Mario Manningham that led to the game-winning drive. Frank Capogrosso, 11, from Staten Island, leaned against a barricade at the beginning of the parade route with his dad and best friend. Believers: Diehard fans react - and get their cameras ready - as the Giants approach on their way to the City Hall ceremony . Screams: Some fans just could not control their excitement as they celebrated another Super Bowl victory for the Giants in New York City's Canyon of Heroes . 'This is better than TV. I love the cop cars, the toilet paper and the ecstatic fans,' he said. 'I love the Giants. I love their style. They play, they don't talk.'The parade for the Super Bowl champions will have an estimated economic impact of up to $38 million for the city, depending on the number of spectators, Bloomberg said. As many as 1 million were expected - about a third of them from outside New York. Bloomberg asked: 'Are you feeling deja blue all over again?' referring to the team's 2008 win. The crowd cheered. The parade for the Super Bowl champions will have an estimated economic impact of up to $38million for the city, depending on the number of spectators, Bloomberg said. After the parade, the team will travel to New Jersey for a 3pm rally at MetLife Stadium, where the team plays. Economic windfall: Mayor Bloomberg said the parade will have an estimated economic impact of up to $38million for New York City . Faithful: Fans were lined up as early as 6am hoping to catch a glimpse of their favourite gridiron stars . It's hard to imagine a victory more exciting than the Giants' last-minute 21-17 victory over the Patriots. The hero of this year's parade was Manning, the Super Bowl's Most Valuable Player who hoisted the Vince Lombardi Trophy for all to see. Workers in high-rises tossed confetti - and later entire pieces of papers - from their windows. Jun Kim, 28, a Korean linguist at the law firm Kenyon & Kenyon, reserved his biggest batch for Manning. 'You are a star!' he yelled as the quarterback passed by. 'People thought he would crumble under pressure, but he didn't. He's the best.' Just moments after the parade passed by, a lineup of sanitation plows scraped their way up Broadway, pushing mounds of confetti - some as high as 5 feet.As the parade wound up around noon, fans stood on sidewalks ankle deep in the paper that was later sucked up by sanitation workers armed with hand-held vacuums. School's out? Some teens skipped their high school classes to attend the New York Giantss celebration of their Super Bowl victory . Roaming with Giants: Fans were in awe as the New York Giants slowly made their way through the Canyon of Heroes in lower Manhattan . New York City Sanitation Commissioner John Doherty said he expected to see about 40 tons of paper showered down. That's a lot but not one for the record books. The streets in lower Manhattan on Tuesday were a mass of metal police barricades, and security was tight with helicopters flying overhead and police command centers parked nearby. Mindy Forman, 53, of Yorktown, New York, was one of the lucky few who scored a ticket to the festivities at City Hall. She said the win was a much-needed victory at a time when many could use some cheering up. She counted herself among that group: She was laid off two weeks ago from her job as a college administrator. 'It celebrates New York,' she said. 'It celebrates the city. It celebrates the state. And it gives people something to believe in in very hard times.' The city threw 5,438 tons of ticker tape on returning veterans at the end of World War II in 1945. The second-highest amount of paper was thrown to honor astronaut John Glenn in 1962 - 3,474 tons. Fans: The New York Giants faithful cheer as members of the team make their way up Broadway during the ticker-tape parade . That's a lot of paper: Tons of ticker-tape were dropped onto fans and the celebrating New York Giants from the high-rise buildings lining the streets . Victory: As many as 1 million Giants fans were expected to attend the parade - with about a third of them from outside New York . The actual ticker tape from those days has been replaced by recycled paper that's shredded into confetti. Sanitation spokeswoman Kathy Dawkins says the department picked up 34.2 tons of paper after the Giants' last parade in 2008. Even before the parade started, city sanitation crews with hand-held vacuums were ready to suck up the piles of confetti that would rain on Broadway. Not in on the fun: The parade was infiltrated by a bitter New England Patriots fan, who was arrested by NYPD . Go team: Office workers cheered from their buildings as the New York Giants made their way up Broadway on their way to City Hall . Big Blue Apple: Fans tried to get the attention of their favourite players as they showed their appreciation for the Super Bowl victory . New York has feted its public heroes since 1919, with the first parade for World War I General John Pershing and his victorious troops. They were followed by more than 200 parades honoring such people as aviator Charles Lindbergh, scientist Albert Einstein, Pope John Paul, South African leader Nelson Mandela and pianist Van Cliburn.

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 4:40 PM on 7th February 2012 . A broken heart, a gun and a bite mark will finally prove a former LAPD detective killed a love rival almost three decades ago in a fit of rage after the woman married her ex-boyfriend, a court heard. Stephanie Lazarus, 51, of Los Angeles, allegedly beat and shot dead Sherri Rasmussen, 29, in February 1986 after her lover John Reutten wed the hospital nursing director instead of her. Shocking close-up death pictures of the battered face of Mrs Rasmussen were presented to jurors in the trial of Lazarus on Monday, showing one eye swollen shut and the other wide open. Scroll down for video . Staring: Lawyers outlined their cases, portraying Stephanie Lazarus, 51, seen in 2009, as either a heartbroken, jilted lover driven to kill her romantic rival or an innocent woman in a web of mishandled scientific evidence . Mrs Rasmussen's mouth was open wide, her hands held up as if in a defensive posture. Prosecutors suggested the mayhem was inflicted by Lazarus after her lover married this woman instead of her. Another photo shows Mrs Rasmussen ethereal in a wedding gown and holding a bouquet of flowers. ‘Sherri Rasmussen was wearing the gown that Stephanie Lazarus believed was hers,’ Deputy District Attorney Shannon Presby said on Monday in his opening statement to jurors in a Los Angeles court. But a lawyer for the one-time top cop said she is being wrongly accused in a case so old some of the witnesses can’t remember it. And he said much of the DNA evidence has deteriorated over time. Retired LAPD cop Rodney Forrest testified about going to Mrs Rasmussen's home after the killing. But after he gave details including a description of her distraught husband, defence lawyer Mark Overland asked if Mr Forrest had told prosecutors last year that he remembers nothing of the case. In court: Stephanie Lazarus, 51, left, of Los Angeles, California, allegedly beat up and shot Sherri Rasmussen, 29, right, after her lover John Reutten married the former hospital nursing director instead of her in 1986 . Love triangle: John Reutten, right, married former hospital nursing director Sherri Rasmussen, 29, left, before Stephanie Lazarus, 51, allegedly killer her in 1986 . ‘Yes,’ said Mr Forrest, who acknowledged asking to see his notes from 1986. ‘Did you remember then?’ asked Mr Overland. ‘I remembered what was on the report and a few other things,’ he said. Mr Presby told jurors she understood memories have faded. Ronald Reagan was President when Mrs Rasmussen was found beaten and shot to death. DNA analysis had not yet been discovered. 'Sherri Rasmussen was wearing the gown that Stephanie Lazarus believed was hers' Shannon Presby, prosecuting . Lawyers outlined their cases, portraying her as either a heartbroken, jilted lover driven to kill her romantic rival or an innocent woman snared in a web of mishandled scientific evidence. In the courtroom audience sat Mrs Rasmussen's relatives including parents and her sister, Teresa Lane, who testified about the relationship between Mrs Rasmussen and Mr Ruetten. ‘They were walking holding hands like a happy couple,’ she said of a visit the day before the death. Rasmussen family lawyer John Taylor said outside court that the dead woman’s relatives would be there every day even though it’s ‘tough’ for them to view the evidence. Old case: A lawyer for the onetime top cop Lazarus, pictured, said she is being wrongly accused in a case so old some of the witnesses can't remember it . Scene: Lazarus allegedly broke into the townhouse that Mr Ruetten shared with Mrs Rasmussen, his new wife, then bludgeoned and shot her to death after a confrontation that left blood on the walls . ‘It took 26 years to get here finally,’ Mr Taylor said. ‘The family is pleased to get the trial going.’ Both sides said the proof of the cold case would be in the forensic evidence. ‘A bite, a bullet, a gun barrel and a broken heart,’ Mr Presby declared in the crowded courtroom. ‘That's the evidence that will prove the defendant Stephanie Lazarus murdered Sherri Rasmussen.’ 'They were walking holding hands like a happy couple' Teresa Lane, Sherri Rasmussen's sister . He said a bite on Mrs Rasmussen's arm contained saliva that was matched to Lazarus's DNA more than two decades after the killing. But Lazarus's lawyer Mr Overland said the DNA was corrupted over the decades, and a forensic dentist would testify that the bite mark does not match an impression taken of Lazarus's teeth. Mr Presby acknowledged the gun used in the killing wasn't found but said the bullets came from the same type of weapon that was sold to Lazarus at the LAPD gun shop when she became an officer. Mr Overland suggested police were correct when they initially suspected she was killed by burglars. Mum and dad: Neil and Loretta Rasmussen, the parents of shooting victim Sherri Rasmussen, seen in 2009 . Behind bars: Lazarus's lawyer Mr Overland said the DNA was corrupted over the decades, and a forensic dentist would testify that a bite mark does not match an impression taken of Lazarus's teeth . Mr Presby told a story of Lazarus being obsessed with Mr Ruetten, who did not return her feelings. When Mr Ruetten told her he was marrying another woman, he said she was driven to vengeance. He said she broke into the townhouse that Mr Ruetten shared with Mrs Rasmussen, his new wife, then bludgeoned and shot her to death after a confrontation that left blood on the walls. 'A bite, a bullet, a gun barrel and a broken heart. That's the evidence that will prove the defendant Stephanie Lazarus murdered Sherri Rasmussen' Shannon Presby, prosecuting . Mr Presby read part of a letter Lazarus wrote to her mother beforehand. ‘I'm totally in love with John and the past year has really torn me up,’ it said. ‘I don't think I'll ever understand his decision.’ Mr Overland said the relationship between Lazarus and Mrs Ruetten was not one-sided. They were college friends who later became lovers, and their sexual relationship lasted about a year. She became close to his family and thought they had a future. But he chose Mrs Rasmussen and a short time before the wedding, Lazarus appealed to Mr Ruetten to meet with her, Mr Overland said. He came to her home and the meeting ended with them having sex, the lawyer said, adding: ‘He told Stephanie Lazarus he was moving on with his life.’ Lazarus has been in custody since 2009.

Dozens of houses were destroyed and children were crushed to death when their school building collapsed after a devastating earthquake hit the central Philippines this morning. At least 13 people were killed, and 29 remain missing, after the 6.8-magnitude quake struck in a narrow strait just off Negros Island. A tsunami alert was issued after the disaster, but later lifted. Thousands of residents were trapped in their homes as a landslide hit the city of Guihulngan in Negros Oriental province. Chaos: Dozens of houses were destroyed and children were crushed to death when their school building collapsed after a devastating earthquake hit the central Philippines this morning . Escape: Filipinos came out onto open grounds in Cebu City following the quake . City Mayor Ernesto Reyes said: 'Their situation is bad because if you are covered by landslide for one hour, two hours, how can you breathe? But we just hope for the best, that there are still survivors.' He said rescuers were using picks and shovels to dig for survivors. Reyes said at least 10 people were confirmed dead in his city, including students at a college and an elementary school and others in a market that collapsed. About 100 were injured. The quake, which hit at 11.49am (0349 GMT), triggered another landslide in the mountain village of Solongon in La Libertad town, also in Negros Oriental. An unknown number of people were trapped, said La Libertad police chief inspector Eric Arrol Besario, who added: 'We're now getting shovels and chain saws to start a rescue because there were people trapped inside. Some of them were yelling for help earlier.' Three key bridges in the town suffered cracks and were no longer passable, he said. Philippine seismologists briefly issued a tsunami alert for the central islands. Terror: Residents ran for their lives as the earthquake hit in Cebu City . Running scared: At least 13 people were killed, and 29 remain missing, after the 6.8-magnitude quake struck in a narrow strait just off Negros Island . Five bamboo and wooden cottages were washed out from a beach resort in La Libertad by huge waves, but there were no reports of injuries, said police Superintendent Ernesto Tagle. Elsewhere along the coast, people rushed out of schools, malls and offices. The epicenter was closest to Tayasan, a coastal town of about 32,000 people flanked by mountains in Negros Oriental province. Two died there, including a child when a concrete fence of a house collapsed, said Benito Ramos, head of the Office of Civil Defence. Another child was killed in a church when a wall collapsed during a funeral in Negros Oriental's Jimalalud town, Mayor Reynaldo Tuanda said. Tayasan police officer Alfred Vicente Silvosa said aftershocks were preventing people from returning to their homes. Seismologists recorded nearly 45 aftershocks. Panic: Filipinos fled to the streets as the earthquake jolted central Philippines . Look-out: Filipinos surveyed the damage from the upper floors of Cebu City buildings following the quake . Silvosa said: 'We are outside, at the town plaza. We cannot inspect buildings yet because it's dangerous. 'I felt the building shaking, so I rushed out of the building. Our computers, shelves, plates, the cupboards, water dispenser all fell.' A three-story office building also collapsed in La Libertad, but occupants managed to run out. Negros Oriental police chief Edward Carranza said the temblor damaged many houses in Guihulngan and he ordered his men to help displaced residents find shelter. Officials in some areas suspended work and canceled classes. Power and telecommunications were knocked out in several places.

'Now it's shaking again,' he said as an aftershock hit, 'My keychain is dancing.' The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake was centred 44 miles north of Dumaguete city on Negros and hit at a depth of 29 miles. The area is about 400 miles southeast of the capital, Manila.

A secret recording in which a patient allegedly tells her married GP that he has ‘such a kissable mouth’ was played to a disciplinary panel yesterday. Dr Simon Robinson could also be heard asking the woman to stroke his chest during the taped sex sessions at his surgery and in the patient’s home, it was claimed. The two hour-long recordings – which feature sounds of kissing and heavy breathing – were made by the woman after she says she began to feel ‘used’ in their affair and decided to expose him. Dr Simon Robinson with his wife Catherine at a previous hearing. He was allegedly engaged in a sexual relationship with a vulnerable patient . The General Medical Council fitness to . practise panel convened yesterday to listen to the tapes along with . both the doctor and his alleged ex-lover, who he called ‘my number one . patient’. At one point a male voice says ‘Stroke . my nipples’ and then ‘Thank you’ twice, to which the woman replies . ‘You’re welcome’, before the pair laugh. At another, the pair discuss medical . matters before both fall silent and for ten minutes the only sound is . the patient making moaning noises. Robinson admits he ‘overstepped the mark’ but denies the pair had a sexual relationship and claims the tapes are fabricated. The 44-year-old GP, from Oswestry, . Shropshire, is accused of conducting a 16-month affair between 2009 and . 2010 with the woman, who was referred to only as Patient A. He allegedly . even asked her to call for a doctor when he was providing out-of-hours . cover so he could come round to her house and have her perform a sex act . on him. The affair allegedly lasted 16 months . Robinson, whose wife Catherine did not attend, is also accused of asking Patient A to send . photographs of herself wearing lingerie as well as sending her cards . with messages including: ‘Behave yourself and you’ll always be my number . one patient.’ Patient A allegedly decided to record . the sex sessions using her mobile phone hidden in her handbag at his . surgery and then on a windowsill at her home. During one tape, Patient A was heard . to say, ‘Well have you missed me?’, before noises of kissing and heavy . breathing were heard over a ten-minute period. In the second clip, Patient A is heard . to say, ‘You have such a kissable mouth’, followed by some inaudible . sounds after which she says: ‘I really think you should run off with . me.’ Patient A also compiled a diary during . the alleged romance. She submitted an item of clothing that she says . had Robinson’s body fluid on it to the Manchester hearing. Under cross-examination, Patient A . denied claims by Robinson’s lawyer, Andrew Hockton, that she had . ‘fantasised’ about having a relationship with the GP. The solicitor suggested that while . sexual activity is alleged to have been taking place on the second tape, . Robinson had actually been out of the room as she had asked him to move . her washing machine. Patient A has drawn a diagram of the . GP’s body for the panel. On it she pinpointed the moles that she claims . he has, as well as their shape and size. She has described them as red, . flat and blotchy. Mr Hockton said Robinson had told her he had a condition which meant he had lots of moles, but she denied knowing this. Robinson, who denies many of the allegations against him, is accused of misconduct. The hearing continues.","Audio footage played to GMC disciplinary panel .

Paralysed: Little Thusha Kamaleswaran will never walk again after she was shot through the chest while playing in her uncle's shop in Stockwell Road, south London . A girl of five ‘died’ twice after being shot by three masked suspected gang members trying to gun down a rival, a court was told yesterday. Thusha Kamaleswaran took a bullet in the chest as she played beside her parents in the aisle of her uncle’s grocery shop. She was hit by one of two shots fired through the open door by young men circling outside on bicycles after their intended victim fled into the shop. Her life was saved by paramedics who operated on her in the street after the bullet passed through her body. And surgeons brought her back to life again as she suffered a heart attack during emergency surgery in hospital. But Thusha was left permanently paralysed from the waist down and will never walk again after the shooting in Stockwell, South London. Her parents were at the Old Bailey yesterday as three young men went on trial accused of offences including attempted murder. They are suspected of being gang members who wanted to kill a rival in the latest episode of a violent feud. Prosecutor Edward Brown QC said that instead they hit two innocent bystanders who were both ‘remarkably lucky’ to survive. ‘One was a five-year-old girl. You will see the moment she was shot. It was captured on CCTV. The other was a 35-year-old man. ‘All he was doing was getting provisions from his local shop. He suffered a bullet wound to his face. You will see that moment also.’ Thusha was gunned down as she played in the aisle of Stockwell Food and Wine on the evening of March 29 last year. Her older brother and younger sister narrowly escaped injury. In the dock: Defendants (from left to right) Nathaniel Grant, Anthony McCalla and Kazeem Kolawole in an artist's impression of the scene at the Old Bailey yesterday . The prosecution said Thusha ‘must have been in sight of the gunman’ and possibly his accomplices as they stopped outside on bicycles. The bullet came out of her back and she underwent ‘invasive surgery’ in the street as paramedics battled to keep her alive. She was taken to King’s College Hospital in an ambulance under police escort where surgeons performed another emergency operation. Mr Brown said the masked gunmen were on a ‘determined mission’ to kill a rival, Roshaun Bryan. ‘Three young men on bicycles, with their faces partially concealed by masks, pursued their intended victim forcing him to take refuge in a shop. ‘One of the young men was armed with a handgun.  The evidence demonstrates that they were likely to have been looking for members of a rival gang. They thought they had succeeded. ‘They circled together outside the shop on their bicycles. One shot was fired. The gunman pulled up again immediately outside the shop, held up the handgun again and fired a second shot through the open door. ‘It may be that there were attempts to fire the gun more than twice. The shots missed their target and struck  two completely innocent bystanders.’ Aftermath: Police cordon off the scene of the shooting which took place in March last year . Parents: Jeyakumar Ghanasekaram, left, and Sharmila Kamaleswaran whose daughter was shot arrive at the Old Bailey . Mr Brown added: ‘The reality of this shooting may be that while there was an intention to kill the suspected rival gang member, the gunman and his accomplices could not have cared less if someone else was shot too.’ The second victim, Roshan Selvakumar, 35, who was chatting to the owner before returning home to his  flat above the shop, was hit in  the face but miraculously survived. The court heard that if the shot had been a tiny distance to the left or right he would ‘surely’ have been killed and the bullet fragments remained in his head because it was too dangerous to remove them. Nathaniel Grant, 21, and Anthony McCalla and Kazeem Kolawole, both 19, are accused over the shooting. Grant is accused of pulling the trigger. Mr Brown said all were alleged members of a gang involved in rivalry with another. ‘The immediate legacy of that gang violence lies in Thusha’s permanent disability and the bullet that remains in Mr Selvakumar.’ ‘There can be little doubt that not only was Roshaun Bryan in the line of sight of the gunman but also that Thusha, there in the shop, was in the line of sight.’ The three defendants, all from South London, deny attempting to murder Mr Bryan, causing grievous bodily harm and firearms offences. The trial continues.","Doctors had to perform invasive heart surgery on Thusha Kamaleswaran after her heart stopped .

"By . Ray Massey . Last updated at 12:56 AM on 30th December 2011 . Rail passengers in Britain pay up to ten times more for their tickets than their European neighbours, figures reveal today. They come as passengers brace themselves for a fresh round of fare rises of up to 11 per cent from Monday, and against a background of worsening train punctuality. Critics say consumers are being ‘ripped off’ by an alliance of greedy train companies and tax-hungry Treasury ministers while passengers on the Continent pay significantly less for their journeys. Rail passengers in Britain pay up to ten times more for their tickets than their European neighbours, figures reveal today . A report by the Campaign for Better Transport shows British train passengers pay three-and-a-half times more than even the most expensive equivalent commuter journey of 21-24 miles highlighted on the other side of the Channel. It says a 2011 annual season ticket for the journey from Woking to London, including Tube travel in the capital, costs £3,268. Yet a similar 22-mile trip from Velletri to Rome costs Italian season ticket holders just £336.17 – nearly a tenth of the price. In France, a season ticket for the 24-mile trip from Ballancourt-sur-Essonne to Paris costs £924.66 – a third of the UK fare. The cost of a season ticket on the  21-mile Strausberg-to-Berlin route in Germany is £705.85, while the 22-mile journey from Collado Villalba to Madrid costs Spanish season ticket holders £653.74. The CBT’s figures include the cost of travel on each city’s underground system. The group’s Sophie Allain said: ‘When the cost of season tickets is so much higher than other European capitals, the fare rises are starting to affect the UK’s competitiveness. 'We still have the highest fares in Europe, and they will be around 24 per cent higher by the next election.’ The Association of Train Operating Companies described the study as ‘a flimsy piece of research that does not stand up to scrutiny, focusing on just one season ticket out of tens of thousands available’. But the RMT transport union boss Bob Crow said it was ‘more proof that UK passengers are getting robbed blind by a combination of train operator greed and government incompetence’. On Monday, more than 100million inflation-busting New Year rail fares go ‘live’, with an average rise – covering both regulated and unregulated fares – of 5.9 per cent. Regulated fares, which include  season tickets and make up around 40 per cent of the total, will rise by an average of 6 per cent. But train companies have ‘flexibility’  to add another 5 per cent – making 11 per cent rises possible – provided other fares come down to compensate and keep the ‘average’ at 6 per cent. The basic 6 per cent rise in regulated fares is set by the Government and based on the July 2011 RPI inflation figure plus 1 per cent. Ministers had planned to increase the fare cap to RPI plus 3 per cent, but this was reversed by George Osborne’s autumn statement in November. However, it is expected to apply from January 2013. On unregulated fares, which make up around 60 per cent of the total, there is no limit on rises. One of the highest increases – 8 per cent – will see a Brighton to London season ticket, including travel on the capital’s underground, rise from £4,304 to £4,644. And commuters from Swindon to London who include Tube travel in their season tickets will be hit with a 6 per cent rise from £7,592 to £8,048. ATOC chief executive Michael Roberts defended the rises, saying ‘money raised through fares helps pay for new trains, faster services and better stations’. The Department for Transport said it recognised the ‘pressure on family budgets’ and cited the decision to keep regulated fare rises at RPI plus 1 per cent, but added: ‘Revenue from fares is helping to deliver one of the biggest programmes of rail capacity improvements for 100 years.’ Last week, the Office of Rail Regulation took enforcement action against  Network Rail for worsening punctuality, with one train in eight (13 per cent)  running late.","£3,000 season ticket in UK is just £300 in Italy ."

Ambulance staff said it was a 'severe collision' which resulted in Mr Ginola suffering 'severe trauma'. Injuries included damage to his throat, and bruises all over his body. After a number of hours in hospital following the accident yesterday afternoon, Mr Ginola was allowed back to his hotel room, but was forced to cancel future engagements. These included an appearance at the high-profile 'snow golf' tournament at nearby Megeve, where he was due to be one of the major celebrities taking part this week. 'It’s a huge disappointment that he will no longer be coming,' said one of the organisers. 'David had a very nasty accident in Portes du Mont Blanc.

Ginola, who also played for Aston Villa and Everton, has also enjoyed some success in TV programmes like the French 'Dancing with the Stars'. However, personal problems have included being sued for maintenance by Joelle Pinquier, a woman who said Ginola fathered her daughter, Joy. Although he refused to take a paternity test, Ginola agreed in 2008 to pay £400 a month maintenance until Joy was 18. Ginola now lives in St Tropez, on the French Riviera, with his former model wife, Coraline, and their two children, Andrea and Carla.

The tumultuous battle for the Republican presidential nomination took a dramatic twist last night when Rick Santorum won three stunning victories and delivered a major blow to Mitt Romney’s White House ambitions. Speaking in St Charles, Missouri, Mr Santorum, former senator for Pennsylvania, declared: 'I don't stand here as the conservative alternative to Mitt Romney, I stand here as the conservative alternative to Barack Obama.' Mr Santorum won by 30 points in Missouri. He beat Mr Romney into third place in Minnesota, behind Representative Ron Paul of Texas, the maverick libertarian. And he added that 'conservatism is alive and well in Missouri and Minnesota' by declaring that on health care to 'Wall Street bailouts, Mitt Romney has the same positions as Barack Obama'. Scroll down for video . Upset: Republican presidential candidate former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum speaks as his wife Karen, right, listens in St Charles . Victorious: Rick Santorum brushes himself down after being 'glitter-bombed' before a campaign rally in Blaine, Minnesota, yesterday . Winner: Rick Santorum won by 30 points in Missouri. He beat Mitt Romney into third place in Minnesota, behind Representative Ron Paul of Texas, the maverick libertarian . In Colorado, where Mr Romney was a heavy favourite, Mr Santorum won by five points. The night was also a poor one for Newt Gingrich, who failed to get on the ballot in Missouri, finished fourth in Minnesota and a distant third in Colorado. He now finds his claim to be the only conservative who can beat Mr Romney seriously undermined. Democrats will be buoyed by the results, which indicate a continuing and brutal primary battle that could seriously weaken Mr Romney if he emerges as the nominee or lead to the candidate facing President Barack Obama coming from the right wing of the Republican party. The results of the contests, however, are only symbolic because no delegates were at stake.

The Romney campaign has insisted it is concentrating on amassing delegates and is unconcerned by 'beauty contests'. Mr Romney held only one event in Minnesota and did not campaign in Missouri. Missouri: . Rick Santorum - 55%Mitt Romney - 25%Ron Paul - 12% . Colorado: . Rick Santorum - 40% Mitt Romney - 35%Newt Gingrich - 13%Ron Paul - 12% . Minnesota: . Rick Santorum - 45%Ron Paul - 27%Mitt Romney - 17%Newt Gingrich - 11% . * Results of the Colorado and Minnesota Republican caucuses and the Republican (non-binding) Missouri primary . Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Santorum said he thought the day could mark a turning point in the race. 'I feel great that Minnesota is going to change the direction of this race tonight,' he said in Blaine, Minnesota. Mr Romney has committed time and financial resources to states across the country in preparation for 'Super Tuesday' on March 6 and retains a major financial advantage. So it remained to be seen whether the night would be anything more than a temporary setback. In a memo released yesterday morning, Rich Beeson, Mr Romney's political director, anticipating defeats, played down the day. He . said: 'Of course, there is no way for any nominee to win first place in . every single contest. John McCain lost 19 states in 2008, and we expect . our opponents to notch a few wins too.' After last night's results, Mr Santorum showed no sign of disappointment when speaking to supporters in Denver. He said: 'This was a good night for Rick Santorum. I want to congratulate . Senator Santorum, but I expect to become the nominee with your help.' Missouri's . Republican Senator Roy Blunt, a Romney supporter, also congratulated . the winner but highlighted that the delegates were still up for grabs. He . said: 'Mitt Romney has the organisation and the resources to go the . distance in this election, and I believe he'll ultimately win our . party's nomination.' Child's play: Youngsters entertained themselves in front of the stage before last night's primary watch party for Rick Santorum in St Charles, Missouri . American dream: Matthew Muttonen, 6, showed off the U.S. flag as he and his family waited for Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum in Blaine, Minnesota . Show your support: A woman picks out a Rick Santorum for President button as she arrives at his victory party at the St. Charles Convention Centre in St Charles, Missouri, last night . As Lady Bracknell might . have remarked: ""To lose a primary in Missouri, Mr Romney, may be . regarded as a misfortune; to lose a primary in Missouri and a caucus in . Minnesota looks like carelessness."" And to lose a caucus in Colorado as . well is a real disaster. This could have been the kind of script Oscar Wilde would have conjured up . for a Republican primary but it certainly wasn't the script that Mitt Romney . drafted. On election night in Florida, after scoring an impressive 15-point victory . in Florida and trampling Newt Gingrich into the ground, the hope in Romneyworld . was that February would be a sweep with momentum and organisation carrying the . day. Pounded: Mitt Romney is once again on the defensive after he was handed embarrassing defeats in three state Tuesday night . All that's changed now. A win in Minnesota or Missouri could have been . explained away as an aberration. But Colorado was a state that Romney won by 60 . points to 18 over John McCain in 2008 and where he campaigned and spent money . this time. Santorum won it by five points. Beneficiary: President Barack Obama could be the real winner as the Republicans seemingly tear themselves apart . For Rick Santorum to win all three . states is a real stunner. What does it mean? Well, Romney remains the favourite but it's going to be a . long and brutal spring. Rick Santorum should put his tin helmet on and prepare for a negative . barrage of the type Gingrich suffered in Florida. Romney's reference to . ""those who have been compromised by the culture of Washington"" is a . hint at a major line of attack - earmarks. We'll doubtless hear a lot too about Santorum's 18-point drubbing in his . home (and swing) state of Pennsylvania in 2006. Money will flow to Santorum but . he will also attract a lot more scrutiny. Romney is in a real bind though - the negative campaign he ran in Florida . was successful in the Sunshine State but clearly had serious ramifications . afterwards. Going to hard against Santorum, a much more likeable character than . Gingrich, could backfire. Tonight is a serious blow for Romney but he's still the overwhelming . favourite to prevail. As Larry Sabato argues here, he's the only candidate with a national . organisation capable of grinding out the 1,144 delegates needed. There were no actual delegates at stake tonight (though the delegates chosen . in Minnesota and Colorado wil closely reflect tonight's results ). Disaster: Romney's camp predicted the end of the road for Newt Gingrich who fared even worse tonight, placing a distance third in Colorado and fourth in Minnesota . In Virginia . on Super Tuesday (March 6th), only Romney and Ron Paul are on the ballot. In . 2008, Barack Obama prevailed over Hillary Clinton because he had a superior . strategy to net delegates. Romney is on track to do the same this time around. Romney's chief strategist Stuart Stevens emailed me tonight: ""Rather . win than lose but no delegates awarded and we're pretty tough minded about . these things. Focused on Super Tuesday and delegates."" It's true that . Stevens always anticipated a bloody war of attrition and was focussed on . delegates from the get go. But the margin of Santorum's victories in Missouri and Minnesota was . extraordinary. These were not just squeakers. In Missouri, Santorum won 55 . percent of the vote compared to Romney's 25 percent - and 250,000 . Republicans turned out. Romney was relegated to third place in Minnesota.

"By . Alanah Eriksen and Donna Mcconnell . Last updated at 8:12 AM on 7th February 2012 . British rapper M.I.A is said to be blaming 'nerves' and 'adrenaline' for her controversial rude gesture during a performance at the Super Bowl yesterday. The singer - best known for the hit song Paper Planes - flipped her middle finger and swore into . the camera during her rap solo as over 100 million fans around the . world watched the performance. While all eyes were on Madonna for a scandalous moment, the broadcasters were caught by surprise by the 36-year-old and scrambled to obscure the gesture in time. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO.... Rude: M.I.A flipped the middle finger during her performance with Madonna and Nicki Minaj at the Super Bowl halftime show . With one foot up on the podium, the 36-year-old rapped: 'I don't give a s***' and pulled the rude gesture during a live performance of Madonna's new song, Give Me All Your Luvin, alongside the pop queen and fellow rapper Nicki Minaj. The screen briefly went blurred in what seemed like a late attempt to cut out the camera shot and Madonna, who at this point was lying on her back behind the rapper, appeared blissfully unaware of the controversial move. The NFL, which produces the show, and the broadcaster, NBC, both apologised immediately but blamed each other for the incident. Too late: The screen briefly went blurred in what seemed like a late attempt to cut out the scene . Veteran and young guns: The singers performed their new song, Give Me All Your Luvin . Brian McCarthy, the league's vice president of communications, said: 'There was a failure in NBC's delay system. Risque: Janet Jackson exposed her nipple as she performed with Justin Timberlake at the 2004 show . 'The obscene gesture in the performance was completely inappropriate, very disappointing, and we apologize to our fans.' And NBC's spokesperson countered: 'The NFL hired the . talent and produced the half-time show. 'Our system was late to obscure . the inappropriate gesture and we apologize to our viewers.' M.I.A.'s publicists at Interscope have not commented. But a member of M.I.A.'s camp claimed the rapper was struck with 'a case of adrenaline and nerves.' 'She wasn't thinking,' said the source, who requested anonymity but was with the artist at Lucas Oil Stadium. ""It wasn't any kind of statement. 'She was caught in the moment and she's incredibly sorry.' But it may be a costly mistake - sources tell TMZ that M.I.A may end up paying any fines imposed in the wake of the drama. She is said to have signed a contract with the NFL for the halftime performance in which she agreed to indemnify the NFL for any money it might be forced to pay if the FCC comes down on the NBC. The controversy mirrors that caused by Janet Jackson's 'wardrobe malfunction' during the 2004 show, which put CBS in . hot water with the Federal Communications Commission. The singer was performing with Justin Timberlake when he ripped open her costume to expose her breast for nine-sixteenths of a second, a moment for which CBS was fined $550,000 by the FCC. Timberlake was quick to distance himself from the furore which left Jackson ostracised by the mainstream for some time after. Upstage you: M.I.A and Madonna are labelmates, and are both preparing to drop new albums . The network challenged the fine and . last autumn, a federal appeals court ruled against the FCC despite an . order from the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. The three-judge panel reviewed three . decades of FCC rulings and concluded the agency was changing its policy, . without warning, by fining CBS for fleeting nudity. After last night's incident, McCarthy . said that M.I.A. had not done anything similar during rehearsals and . the league had no reason to believe she would pull something like that . during the actual show. Madonna had been nervous . about her performance, hoping to position herself as the queen of a new . generation of pop stars with an opulent show and a sharp performance . that mixed her new release with more familiar songs. But it seems she should have been more worried about the performance of her co-star who is no stranger to controversy. Musical sisters: The hip hop star is a new label-mate of Madonna's, and has just released a new video Bad Girls . Hounslow-born M.IA. - real name Mathangi . 'Maya' Arulpragasam - is best known for her Grammy nominated song Paper Planes - which featured in film Slumdog Millionaire. A graphic video for 2010 song Born Free was given an adults-only rating on YouTube and drew parallels with racism. Born . Free takes place in an alternate reality where people with red-hair or . 'gingers' are rounded up by American paramilitary style gang and then . executed and bombed for sport. M.I.A. defended the work and said she . felt that the work of Justin Bieber, the teen heart-throb, was more of . an assault on the senses than her video. The hip hop star, who gave birth to son Ikhyd in February 2009, is a new label-mate of Madonna's, and it should come as no surprise that they both have new material to promote. Madonna's MDNA will first be issued via Interscope when it's released in late March. While M.I.A., has just released a video for her new . single Bad Girls. In the video for the track she takes aim at Saudi Arabia's laws which bans women from driving. Courting controversy: In the video for the track she takes aim at Saudi Arabia's laws which bans women from driving . Muslim academics warned in December . that allowing women to drive would 'provoke a surge in prostitution, . pornography, homosexuality and divorce'. And in the video, M.I.A is seen . heading a crowd of dancing women dressed in traditional Middle-Eastern dress to take part in a drag race. In her family's native Sri Lanka she has been accused of being 'a cheerleader for terrorists' – separatist Tamil Tiger guerrillas – in the country's civil war. As the 'only Tamil in the western media' M.I.A says she has a responsibility to say 'what is going on' in the country. But the majority of people reportedly view the rebels as 'terrorists' who are on the verge of being wiped out by government forces. And some Sri  Lankan musicians have criticised her for 'spreading blatant terrorist propaganda'. Cleopatra? Madonna put on an energetic and spectacular half time show during halftime at the NFL Super Bowl XLVI game . Meanwhile, Madonna had declared she had to put on 'the . greatest show on earth, during the greatest show on Earth' and she certainly didn't disappoint. Though she may be left more than a little put out that her labelmate has garnered the headlines today. The singer, 53, put on an impressive performance during half-time show of the football game between the New York Giants and the New England Patriots. She arrived onstage like Roman royalty when . muscle-bound men carried her extravagant throne across the football . field to the stage for her opening song, Vogue. The Super . Bowl, shown on NBC this year, is routinely viewed by more than 100 . million people, and is the biggest TV event of the year. Still got it: Madonna performed tricks women half her age would struggle to complete . As well as her performance with M.I.A and Minaj, she sang her way through classic hits Vogue, Like a Prayer and Music. While the pressure to perform well . was immense and greatly felt, Madonna appeared to rise to the challenge . and suffered just one small slip-up throughout the show. As she was strutting her way across . the bleachers to Music, the second song in her set, she was unable to . step up onto one of them and had to repeat the dance move to hoist . herself up. But Madonna proved a true professional and laughed the error off throwing herself into the next sequence of the set. Aside . from that trivial mistake the singer put on an . energetic and fun show with help from chart-toppers LMFAO, and Cee Lo Green. The show opened with a huge procession of Egyptian soldiers carrying a large platform as the intro to Vogue began.

"By . Daniel Bates . Last updated at 9:49 PM on 19th December 2011 . He has been mocked for making a $10,000 bet on national TV. But now Mitt Romney has been forced on the defensive again over his wealth after a picture emerged of him and his hedge fund colleagues being showered in money. The picture - which Democrats have likened to Gordon Gekko in the 1987 film ‘Wall Street' - shows the Republican presidential candidate grinning from ear to ear and holding up a $20 note. It was taken whilst he worked at hedge fund Bain Capital in the 1980s and has been seized on as another sign he is too rich to relate to normal people. Too rich? Americans United for Change, a liberal group, has used this 1980s photograph of Mitt Romney (center) and his Bain Capital colleagues to compare him to 'Wall Street' movie villain Gordon Gekko . Today it also emerged that the former Massachusetts governor is still making millions of dollars a year from Bain, even though he retired 13 years ago. The New York Times reported that he negotiated a retirement deal which has flowered into assets worth up to $70.9 million, earning him and his wife $13.4 million between them. Romney is one of the wealthiest candidates ever to run for president and has a family fortune estimated at up to $250 million. But his finances became a campaign issue when he tried to make a $10,000 bet with fellow presidential candidate Rick Perry during the second to last TV debate. Critics have also claimed that whilst at Bain, Romney oversaw layoffs and rampant cost cutting at the companies he took over. The picture of him from the 1980s was . published on the left-leaning Americans United for Change website and . shows the 64-year-old with six colleagues looking very pleased with . themselves indeed. Can he relate? Mr Romney's wealth has become an issue because critics say he can't relate to average, middle and working-class voters . Does Romney's wealth make him out of touch with ordinary Americans? Whilst Romney and a colleague hold one $20 between them, one of his friends is smoking a cigar whilst another has money in his mouth. The man to the far left also has two $20 notes stuffed down either side of his shirt collar. A doctored version has the caption: ‘Greed is good! Romney-Gekko 2012’ above the photo. The New York Times reported that under the deal he negotiated with Bain, Romney still gets a cut from the profits of deals done even after he left. In his 2011 disclosure, he said he had assets in the company between $12.4 million and $60.9 million which has given him between $1.5 million and $9.3 million in income. He has also set up a $10 million trust for his wife which has brought in $4.1 million. Romney also has other investments including an additional $100 million fund for his five sons. Bad odds: The $10,000 bet Mr Romney (right) made with Texas Gov Rick Perry (left) was one of Mr Romney's first gaffes . His total net worth could be much higher, the Times reported, as he is only required to provide minimum estimates held by his wife. The developments came as Romney remained second in the polls to become the Republican presidential nominee, although Newt Gingrich’s campaign appears to be imploding. A survey by Public Policy Polling in Iowa, the first state to choose its candidate, found that Ron Paul was in the lead on 23 per cent, Romney was on 20 per cent and Gingrich was on 14 per cent. In an interview Romney said that the ‘Gordon Gekko’ picture was taken at the closing of Bain’s first fund and that they were just celebrating. He said: ‘We went out as a group of folks, said, you know, I wonder if we can raise money from other people to organise a company, we can get capital from others that will allow us to begin a business that will be successful. ‘And we went out and raised money. We were successful in raising our first fund; it was about $37 million, an extraordinarily large amount of money that we raised from other people. ‘And we posed for a picture, just celebrating the fact that we'd raised a lot of money and then we hoped to be able to return it with a good return’. Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Romney, denied there was anything untoward in his retirement deal with Bain. She said: ‘This was a typical market deal. Bain Capital has no incentive to overpay Governor Romney, and they didn’t.’","Critics say he's too rich to relate to middle-class voters .

Republicans are trying to boost women's support for the GOP presidential nominee by setting up a political action group to back female candidates. An adviser to Sarah Palin, a Tea Party leader and a Republican politician are together starting the innovative ‘ShePAC’ political action committee. Tim Crawford, who has advised 2008 vice presidential nominee Mrs Palin and former President Ronald Reagan, is one of the three founders. Founders: Original Tea Party activist Teri Christoph, left, and ex-Senate candidate Suzanne Haik Terrell, right, now an advocate for GOP women, are both involved . He is joined by original Tea Party activist Teri Christoph and ex-Senate candidate Suzanne Haik Terrell, now an advocate for GOP women. The group filed registration documents with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday to create the super PAC, its leaders said. ShePAC joins dozens of such outside groups that can now raise unlimited amounts of money as long as they don’t work with official campaigns. Thanks to a 2010 U.S. court decision, outside groups have already  spent $54million on congressional and presidential races this campaign season. They are taking over most of the negative advertising and pumping up the cost of running campaigns in traditionally cheaper state races. Experience: Tim Crawford, who has advised 2008 vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, left, and former President Ronald Reagan, right, is the third founder . ShePAC hopes to raise $25million by tapping both grassroots and establishment donors to help GOP women win state and federal races. 'We firmly believe that women will make the difference in 2012 and beyond, not just at the ballot box but as candidates' Suzanne Haik Terrell, ShePAC founder . It will also help bring the women's vote to the GOP nominee opposing Democratic President Barack Obama in the November general election. ‘We firmly believe that women will make the difference in 2012 and beyond, not just at the ballot box but as candidates,’ Ms Terrell said. ‘We seek (to) increase the number of Republican women office holders on all levels with both financial and organisational support.’ The GOP needs four seats in the Senate to take control as the majority party. Only 5.5 per cent of Congress is held by conservative women. Challenge: ShePAC hopes to bring the women's vote to the GOP nominee opposing Democratic President Barack Obama in the November general election . One is Rep. Michele Bachmann, a Tea Party favourite who dropped her presidential bid last month after a poor finish in the Iowa GOP contest. 'We seek (to) increase the number of Republican women office holders on all levels with both financial and organisational support' Suzanne Haik Terrell . Republican women are in Senate races in Hawaii, New Mexico, Missouri, Nebraska, Virginia and Connecticut. ShePAC also may be a vehicle for Wisconsin Lieutenant Governor Rebecca Kleefisch, who has already joined the group's Facebook page. She is facing a recall election alongside Governor Scott Walker after they curtailed collective bargaining rights of unionised public workers.","PAC group set up by three experienced Republicans .

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Last updated at 11:35 AM on 8th February 2012 . Reboot and refresh: The new Fantastic Four - Season One title will be the first in a series to include modern touches in the 1960s comic . They were stories created in an era when phones were attached to hooks, faces were in books and the only tweets were the ones coming from birds in trees. However the modern touches which are so commonplace in today's digital age are to make their debut - in Marvel Comics. The Fantastic Four comic book, which was created in the 1960s, is the first to be modernised in a makeover promising to 'blow the cobwebs off a story that's decades old'. Mobile phones, tablet PCs, the Internet and Twitter are all to feature in 'tweaked' versions of the classic comic in a bid by the publishers to connect younger generations with its 1960s titles. The Fantastic Four is the story of a science genius, his girlfriend, her hot-shot brother and a football player-turned-accomplished pilot, who are exposed to cosmic rays in space and return to Earth with super powers. The origin . of the story is being updated this week in a sleeker tale dubbed 'Season One' with a more contemporary vibe, while sticking to the roots of Reed . Richards, Sue Storm, brother Johnny, and Ben Grimm - who have otherwise been known for . the past 51 years as Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, the Human Torch and . the Thing. The revision is part of Marvel's push to add modern touches to its characters. Marvel also is bringing a modern spin to the origins of its other classic characters this year in similar 'Season One' editions, including Daredevil, Spider-Man and the X-Men. Tom Breevort, who edits the publisher's Fantastic Four lines of books, said: 'The aim is definitely to continue to keep these characters relevant in an ever-changing world, but also to tell a new story set within this time frame, not merely recount or retell comics that other people have previously done. 'We tweaked elements where it made sense. Everybody in the `Season One' books has a cell phone, for example, but we tried to maintain the spirit of the seminal stories that these tales are built upon.' Roberto Aquirre-Sacasa, a playwright . and TV writer whose credits include 'Glee' along with several stories . for Marvel, said 'Fantastic Four: Season One' was not a reboot of the . classic origin, penned by Stan Lee and drawn by Jack Kirby. What a Marvel: The comic book publisher is planning on giving some of its other titles a modern spin . He added: 'It's more of a ... refresh. The world's changed over the last 50 years. How we tell comic stories, how we absorb them, so let's update a great concept by setting it in the present. By giving it a contemporary sensibility.' Artist David Marquez, whose first published comic work 'Syndrome' came out in 2010, likened it to reintroducing classic stories to modern audiences. He said: 'The storytelling techniques we use as creators and the expectations of readers have changed since the FF's origins were first told. 'And because of this, it can be hard for . people who didn't grow up accustomed to the Silver Age style to find . these stories as exciting and inspiring as those of us who did.' Aguirre-Sacasa said the idea is to . make the characters more relevant to a reader who navigates social . media, consumes information and is fluent in not just pop culture, but . entertainment of all stripes. Modern makeover: Jessica Alba in the high-tech 2005 film Fantastic Four, based on the original 1960s comic . He added: 'Another example, and it's just a little thing, but the Fantastic Four - after their ill-fated debut battling the Mole Man - are Internet sensations. 'And Johnny, annoyingly, is burning up Twitter. Again, it's little details like that, which don't alter the fundamental DNA of the Fantastic Four, but blow the cobwebs off a story that's decades old. And have a slightly more pop flavor.' Ultimately, however, no matter the year - be it 1961 or 2012 - the objective is creating a fresh and invigorating story with characters that have been a bedrock for Marvel. Marquez added: 'This was my first big project at Marvel, and it gave me a chance to draw characters I have been in love with since I first started reading comics as a kid. 'I really had to up my game to show everyone at Marvel that I could do justice to Roberto's script, not to mention the high bar set by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.'","Mobile phones, tablet PCs and Twitter to feature in 'refreshed' editions ."

The U.S. Air Force has provoked outrage by removing a Latin reference to God on one of its logos after complaints from a military atheist group. The Rapid Capabilities Office patch included a motto until several weeks ago in Latin saying: ‘Doing God’s Work with Other People’s Money’. But this was altered to ‘Doing Miracles with Other People’s Money’ after the Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers kicked up a fuss. Edit: The Rapid Capabilities Office patch has gone from 'Doing God’s Work with Other People's Money', left, to 'Doing Miracles with Other People’s Money', right . ‘It is most egregious,’ Virginia Rep. Randy Forbes told Fox News. ‘The Air Force is taking the tone that you can’t even use the word “God”.’ ‘(It is a) bridge too far in terms of the rights of men and women who serve in our services and their ability to express their faith.’ Rep. Forbes has asked the Air Force to revert back to the original logo, which was printed as: ‘Opus Dei Cum Pecunia Alienum Efficemus’. He has written to Air Force Secretary Michael Donley and Air Force Chief of Staff Norton Schwartz with 35 other politicians, reported Fox News. A U.S. Air Force spokesman told Fox News that they had received a letter from the lawmakers and will begin a investigation into the claims. Angry: Virginia Rep. Randy Forbes has asked the Air Force to revert back to the original logo and has written to Air Force officials with 35 other politicians . Mr Forbes claimed the removal of the . reference suggests the Air Force believes the word ‘God’ cannot be used . in the force at all. ‘The RCO’s action to modify the logo sets . a dangerous precedent that all references to God (must) be removed from . the military,’ he wrote. 'It is most egregious. The Air Force is taking the tone that you can’t even use the word ""God""' Virginia Rep. Randy Forbes . Mr Forbes believes the change to ‘Miraculi Cum Pecunia Alienum Efficemus’ is not required to abide with the First Amendment. The RCO was created nine years ago to speed up weapon systems and reports to a board of directors including top Air Force officials. Mr Forbes tried to reaffirm ‘In God We Trust’ as the U.S. motto in a bill last November, but Barack Obama was unimpressed, reported The Hill. ‘I trust in God, but God wants to see us help ourselves by putting people back to work,’ President Obama said, reported ABC News at the time.","Change to U.S. Rapid Capabilities Office patch  in Latin .

Support: Janis Sharp and Trudie Styler with the book Gang Of One by Gary Mulgrew, one of the Natwest Three, about his time in a U.S. jail following his controversial extradition . Gary McKinnon’s mother marched on 10 Downing Street yesterday to condemn the ‘barbaric’ treatment of her son. Janis Sharp went to the Prime Minister’s official residence to mark a decade of ‘fear and torment’ since her son’s arrest for computer hacking. Flanked by backers including Trudie Styler, MP David Burrowes and civil liberties campaigner Shami Chakrabarti, she handed in poetry written by supporters. Speaking outside No 10, Mrs Sharp said her son was afflicted by a ‘terror that consumes his every waking moment’. Mr McKinnon, 45, is wanted by the US authorities on charges of hacking into NASA and Pentagon computers from his home in north London. But the Asperger’s sufferer says he was looking for evidence of ‘little green men’. Experts say forcing him to go to America, where he could face a 60-year jail sentence, could lead to him taking his own life. The case has highlighted the ‘unfairness’ of the 2003 extradition treaty between Britain and the US - and sparked the Mail’s Affront to British Justice Campaign. Mrs Sharp said: ‘Ten years have gone by and still Gary lives in a nightmare world - unable to control the terror that consumes his every waking moment. ‘This endless pressure on an Aspergic man with severe mental health issues is barbaric. ‘And for what? A foolish act that caused embarrassment to the US. Where has our sense of proportion gone?’ She added: ‘He can’t deal with it. He sits in the dark - it’s ruined his life. His mental health has deteriorated and it’s ruined our lives.’ She also urged Prime Minister David Cameron to raise the issue with Barack Obama when the two leaders meet at the White House next month. Also lending support at Downing Street was Richard O’Dwyer, who faces being sent to the US on charges his lawyers say are not even a crime in this country. The 23-year-old student is accused of breaking American copyright laws. He set up a website from his halls of residence in Sheffield listing places where films and TV programmes could be illegally downloaded. Gary McKinnon, pictured in 2009 with his mother Janis Sharp, has been battling extradition for a decade . But legal experts say this is not an offence because he did not download any of the entertainment himself. His mother Julia, a pediatric nurse, said: ‘To be fighting this situation for ten years and for Gary and the family having this hanging over their lives for all this time is disgusting. ‘He has more than paid his penalty - and the US is picking on him because he embarrassed them.’ Miss Chakrabarti, director of the civil rights group Liberty, said: ‘I cannot believe it has been ten years. After all the promises that have been made by many politicians we are still here. ‘Janis Sharp is doing this for her son but she is also doing it for everyone else’s sons and daughters.’ ‘As Gary’s ordeal continues so does the current rotten extradition regime. No-one is immune from unfair treatment and the lack of compassion in the system is already devastating too many lives.’ Home Secretary Theresa May agreed to delay his extradition in 2010 and is examining psychiatric evidence before she makes a final decision. Last month two judges sitting in the High Court ruled Gary’s ordeal must be decided by the summer.",Janis Sharp hands in poetry written by campaigners supporting Briton facing extradition .
"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 12:02 PM on 8th February 2012 . Under investigation: The FBI as well as the Met Police are probing possible criminal violations by Rupert Murdoch's staff . Rupert Murdoch's media empire has . given  British authorities emails and financial records that allegedly . chart the payment of £100,000 to police contacts, mostly in small sums. A News Corp source said the records . showed many or most of the payments' intended recipients were listed in . company records under false names. London's Metropolitan Police have been . probing suspected abusive practices which journalists at the News of the . World and other Murdoch London papers allegedly routinely employed in . recent years. His company is . also facing a stepped-up U.S. investigation and FBI inquiry into . possible violations by employees of a U.S. law banning corrupt payments . to foreign officials. But . investigators have found little to substantiate allegations of phone . hacking inside the U.S. by the media mogul’s journalists, law . enforcement and corporate sources said. The . FBI is probing possible criminal violations by Mr Murdoch’s staff of . the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a law intended to curb payment . of bribes by U.S. companies to foreign officials. If any action was pursued by U.S. authorities against Murdoch employees, it would most likely relate to . the FCPA, a U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters. If the company is found to have . violated the FCPA, Murdoch's News Corp, which has its base in New York, . could be fined up to $2million and barred from U.S. government . contracts. Individuals who took part in bribery could face fines of up to $100,000 and five years in jail. Home: If the company is found to have violated the FCPA, Murdoch's News Corp, which has its base in New York, pictured, could be fined up to $2million and barred from U.S. government contracts . Executives could be liable if they authorised bribes or knew about the . practice but failed to stop it. In practice, U.S. authorities have . usually settled FCPA cases in return for large cash payments from . companies, who can sometimes avoid legal admissions of guilt. Much of the documentation was handed over . by the company, who have set up a clean-up unit in London and hired . lawyers in Britain and the U.S., some of whom are FCPA specialists, . company sources said. The U.S. Justice Department and . Securities and Exchange Commission also have jurisdiction to pursue . civil cases against alleged violators of the law. Bloomberg reported last year that . Justice Department prosecutors sent News Corp a request for details on . alleged payments which journalists made to British police officers in . return for news tips. Sources close to News Corp have . discussed the Management Standards Committee of News International . (MSC), the unit set up to deal with phone hacking and related . investigations. Hacking claim: Law enforcement and corporate sources said no evidence had turned up that journalists from Mr Murdoch's now defunct News of the World sought to hack into voicemail messages of victims of 9/11 . It has for some time been concerned . about the consequences of U.S. investigations of possible FCPA . violations, the sources said. Both News International and News Corp . declined to comment. Last July, the company retained Mark . Mendelsohn, who served as deputy chief of the Fraud Section in the . Criminal Division of the U.S. Justice Department. U.S. authorities reportedly found nothing to support claims that potentially . illegal reporting tactics allegedly widespread in Britain were also . employed by Mr Murdoch’s journalists in the U.S. Law . enforcement and corporate sources said no evidence had turned up to . corroborate a Daily Mirror accusation over journalists from Mr Murdoch's . now-defunct News of the World. The . Mirror claimed the NOTW reporters sought to hack into voicemail . messages of victims of the Al Qaeda 9/11 attacks on the U.S. The Mirror . is a competitor of Mr Murdoch's London tabloid, The Sun. Mr Mendelsohn, now in private . practice, was internationally respected as an architect of the DOJ's . Foreign Corrupt Practices Act enforcement programme. News Corp sources confirmed that the . Management Standards Committee was also working with Williams & . Connolly, a prominent Washington law firm specialising in white-collar . crime cases. The New York Times reported last year . that one of the lawyers working on the News Corp case was Brendan . Sullivan, a Williams & Connolly partner. He is known for his public defence of . White House aide Oliver North during Congressional investigations into . an arms-for-hostages scandal during the time of U.S. President Ronald . Reagan. News Corp announced last month that . another Williams & Connolly partner, Gerson Zweifach, would become . its top new in-house lawyer. He is also expected to join the MSC. Company sources said that, via the . MSC, News International was routinely sharing with its outside lawyers . evidence which had been uncovered of suspected questionable practices. Arrested but not charged: To date, no criminal . charges have been filed against any of the individuals arrested over the . past year, who include former News International CEO Rebekah Brooks, . left, and Andy Coulson, right . British detectives are conducting . three parallel investigations. One inquiry, known as Operation Weeting, . is investigating alleged phone hacking. A second inquiry, Operation Tuleta, is . probing computer hacking claims. The third, Operation Elveden, is . investigating allegations that journalists paid police officers bribes . in return for tipoffs. The head of the three investigations said this week she was increasing the number of police looking at police payments. London police have arrested 30 people, . including journalists and police officers, in connection with its three . journalism-related investigations. Long story: Current probes trace their roots . back to the 2006 arrests, and guilty pleas, of NOTW royal reporter Clive . Goodman, left, and private detective Glenn Mulcaire, right on phone . hacking charges . Last month, four current and former . journalists on The Sun, as well as a serving police officer, were . arrested in connection with Operation Elveden. Sue Akers, the officer in charge of . all the investigations, said on Monday that 14 people so far had been . arrested in connection with Operation Elveden. But she indicated that more investigators were likely to be added to the inquiry, which she said still had some time to run. To date, no criminal charges have been . filed against any of the individuals arrested over the past year, who . include Rebekah Brooks, a former CEO of Murdoch's London papers. Andy Coulson, a former Murdoch editor . who became top media adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron, was also . arrested but not charged to date. However, current probes trace their . roots back to the 2006 arrests, and guilty pleas, of NOTW royal reporter .

"By . Charles Walford . Last updated at 2:47 PM on 8th February 2012 . Virgin Train staff are the latest rail workers to be promised a bonus for working during the Olympic Games. The unions have brokered a deal for workers at Richard Branson's company to receive a payment of £500, it was announced today. The move will be seen as the latest attempt by train firms and the Government to bribe workers not to strike during the Olympics after similar deals were struck with London DLR workers and Network Rail. The Rail Maritime and Transport union said drivers, conductors and other train crew will be entitled to the extra payment. Bonus: Staff at Virgin Trains will be getting an extra £500 pay for working during the Olympics . Richard Branson's company will run some additional trains during the games . Staff will also receive an annual pay rise of 4.6 per cent or £950, whichever is the greater, from April. Virgin will run some additional train services for the duration of the Games in London this summer, but it is believed all staff will get the bonus. An RMT circular to staff said: 'In recognition of your agreement to work to these arrangements, all grades that are covered by collective bargaining will receive a one-off taxable lump sum payment of £500 payable on Friday 14th September 2012.' General secretary Bob Crow said: 'This is another deal that protects our members' standards of living and rewards them for carrying the extra pressure of the Olympics. 'It is also another victory for the RMT's industrial campaigning and organising strategy which has delivered the goods for our members once again.' The union has struck deals for Olympic payments for workers in several companies including Network Rail, London Overground and Docklands Light Railway, but has yet to agree a figure with London underground. Thousands of militant Tube workers last month rejected a £500 bonus for doing their jobs during the Olympics. RMT leader bob Crow has already been accused of 'holding London to ransom' Union bosses insisted it was not an 'adequate reward' for 14,000 staff including drivers, station and ticket staff,  signallers and engineers. The RMT was accused of holding London Underground and Olympic chiefs to ransom after talks on the payment ended in disagreement. Unite is seeking a payment of £500 for thousands of bus workers in the capital. The proposed bonus for Underground staff would come on top of £1,200 extra already earmarked for 3,500 Tube drivers for working different and longer shifts during the Olympics. Former Transport Minister Stephen Hammond MP said last month: 'The unions should not hold London to ransom during the Olympics as millions of people struggle during these difficult economic times.'",Bob Crow's RMT brokered deal with train staff .
"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 7:13 PM on 7th February 2012 . Bombs continued to rain down on the Syrian city of Homs for a fourth day today, as President Bashar Assad stepped up his efforts to put down a popular uprising against his regime. Government troops used rocket launchers, tanks and machine guns to kill 95 yesterday - following Friday's bloody massacre of 200 and the blowing up a makeshift medical centre and two oil pipelines. Today's renewed attack came as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov arrived in Damascus to meet Assad to discuss ways to try to end the uprising. Scroll down for video... Wounded: Rebels injured in the bombardment flash a victory sign as Assad's regime intensified its crackdown on opposition . Battered: Makeshift medical centres and homes have been hit by mortars and machine gun fire as the crackdown by Assad's forces continues . Cold comfort: The email said Asma Assad was helping the bereaved to cope. Pictured here are the victims of shelling by the Syrian army in the Khalidiya neighbourhood in Homs . Lavrov began the one-day talks by telling Assad that Moscow wants Arab people to 'live in peace and harmony'. He is reported as saying: 'Every leader of every country must be aware of his share of responsibility. You are aware of yours. It is in our interests for Arab peoples to live in peace and agreement.' The remarks may be intended to prompt Assad to take steps to end 11 months of bloodshed which most of the world blames largely on his government. Russia has said Assad's opponents must also share responsibility for the violence. His visit comes days after Syrian allies Russia and China vetoed a resolution at the United Nations that would have condemned the crackdown on dissent and called on him to transfer some of his powers to his deputy. The Syrian government had also rejected the Arab plan as intervention in internal affairs. Warm welcome: Assad's supporters took to the streets to welcome Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov today . Greeting: Syrian President Bashar Assad (left) held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov (right) in a bid to try and diffuse the escalating violence . Colourful: Pro-Syrian regime supporters gathered under a huge Russian flag made from balloons to cheer on the convoy carrying Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov . Prime Minister David Cameron today chaired a meeting of the National Security Council to discuss the deteriorating situation in Syria. The meeting came as European Union states began work on a new round of sanctions against the Middle Eastern country, expected to be agreed on February 27. That could include a freeze on Syria's central bank assets and a ban on trade in precious metals. Ahead of the NSC meeting, Foreign Secretary William Hague briefed Cabinet on developments following Russia and China's veto of a United Nations resolution designed to end President Bashar Assad's bloody crackdown on dissent. Lavrov was greeted by a convoy as it . ran along the Mazzeh boulevard among a sea of Assad supporters who . turned up to express gratitude for Moscow's support. One supporter, 45-year-old Manya . Abbad, said: 'I am here to thank Russia for its stand in the face of the . world conspiracy against Syria. 'I wish the Arabs adopted similar . stances.' The total . death toll since March 2011 now stands at more than 5,400. Authorities say they are fighting 'terrorists' keen on dividing and . sabotaging the country. Mohammad al-Hassan, an activist in Homs, . said: 'The bombardment is again concentrating on Bab Amro. 'A doctor . tried to get in there this morning but I heard he was wounded. 'There is no electricity and all communication with the neighbourhood has been cut.' Bombed out: Asma Assad said she still supported her husband, who has launched a crackdown on opposition groups in recent months . Destroyed: An obliterated military vehicle lies in a Homs street yesterday after it was struck by mortars fired by troops loyal to Syria's ruling regime . Police in Berlin have today arrested two Syrians they accuse of spying for the Assad regime on opposition members to be earmarked for assassination. German police said the suspected agents were collating information on opponents of Assad. The homes of six people suspected of aiding the agents were being searched this morning as the men were taken into custody. The suspected spies were only identified as 47-year-old Mahmoud el-A, and 34-year-old Akram O. Media reports said the duo and their safe-house assistants had been under the observation of intelligence agencies for some time. Some 70 police and intelligence officials were involved in the arrests. Syria, . a majority Sunni Muslim nation, has been since 1970 under the rule of . the Assad family from the minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shi'ite . Islam. Moscow has previously vetoed a resolution against Syria at the United Nations Security Council. Catherine . al-Talli, a senior member of the opposition Syrian National Council, . said the attack on Homs was aimed to show Moscow that Assad was in . control and he could serve until his term expires in 2014. Talli . said: 'Assad needs to look strong in front of the Russians. He has not . managed to control Homs since the eruption of the uprising. 'Now that he has seen that he faces no real threat from the international community it appears that he wants to finish off the city. 'There are live television feeds from Bab Amro and the whole world can see indiscriminate shelling of civilians. This has not stopped him.' And Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the Security Council veto a 'fiasco'. Panic: A hospital in the rebel-held city of Homs under attack yesterday . Terror: Iraqi families pictured arriving in Baghdad after fleeing from their homes in Syria. They had initially fled their home countries after the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 . He said his country cannot remain . silent about the massacres in Syria and will continue to support the . Arab League efforts. And he added: 'We will launch a new initiative with . countries that stand by the Syrian people instead of the regime.' It was not clear what kind of steps Turkey might be planning. But U.S. Secretary of State Hillary . Clinton has called for 'friends of democratic Syria' to unite and rally . against Assad's regime, previewing the possible formation of a group of . like-minded nations to coordinate assistance to the Syrian opposition . from outside the UN. Support: British Foreign Secretary William Hague said help would be provided to the rebels . Yesterday Britain said it would send . equipment to help the opposition oust Assad. Foreign Secretary William Hague announced plans for a dramatic escalation of support for the rebels and said . there was 'no limit on what resources we can provide'. He . ruled out British military action but said the UK is poised to provide . 'strategic communications' equipment to help different rebel groups work . together against the 'murderous' regime. Diplomatic sources compared the situation to the war in Libya. And . they said Britain will seek to provide radios and mobile phones and . work with Turkey and other neighbouring nations to allow rebels to . broadcast radio programmes into Syria. The UK will also back fresh European Union sanctions later this month designed to 'fracture the regime'. That will see a new crackdown on activities by the Syrian Central Bank and imposing travel bans and asset freezes on regime officials to encourage them to abandon Assad. Mr Hague recalled the British ambassador to Syria yesterday for talks as violence erupted again, which prompted the  U.S. to withdraw all its embassy staff for security reasons. The U.S. Embassy in Amman has also warned American citizens not to travel to Syria and is recommending that anybody in the country leave immediately. The French, Italian and Spanish foreign ministries have also said they were recalling their ambassadors to Syria for consultations because of the continued crackdown. But the countries said their embassies in Damascus would remain open. Standing guard: A member of the Free Syrian Army watches over anti-regime protesters holding a demonstration in the city of Idlib . Defiance: Protesters dance on the streets during a demonstration in Idlib, Syria . In a statement to the Commons, Mr Hague denounced Russia and China after they vetoed a UN Security Council resolution condemning the violence. Western diplomats are furious with Russia and China, arguing that they bent over backwards in rewriting the resolution so it could not be construed as a precursor to military action – and they still refused to sign it. Mr Hague accused Russia and China of 'betraying the Syrian people'. He said: 'The human suffering in Syria is already unimaginable and is in grave danger of escalating further. 'They chose to side with the Syrian regime and implicitly to leave the door open to further abuses by them. They did so while President Assad’s tanks were encircling Homs and shells were pounding the homes of Syrian civilians.' Mr Hague said the Assad regime cannot survive. His thoughts are echoed by U.S. President Barack Obama, who said the Syrian leader's departure was only a matter of time. Anti-regime protesters play drums and wave a revolutionary flag during demonstrations in Idlib . Casualties: YouTube footage shows the bodies of three people reportedly . killed in shelling on Rastan in the central province of Homs. He told NBC: 'We have been relentless in sending a message that it is time for Assad to go.'This is not going to be a matter of if, it's going to be a matter of when.' And Hague told MPs: 'This is a doomed regime as well as a murdering regime. There is no way it can recover its credibility internationally or with its own people.' In a bid to shame Russia and China, the UK and other countries are planning to pass a resolution condemning the violence in the UN’s General Assembly, where vetoes cannot be used. The UK will also beef up a diplomatic team under Francis Guy, who is an unofficial ambassador to the Syrian opposition, to 'intensify' those contacts. The team will work to get the Syrian opposition groups to agree a common platform, just as rebels did in Libya. Mr Hague also announced plans for a new contact group to help the Arab League plan to end the bloodshed . It will see the EU, the Arab League and other countries come together to ‘co-ordinate intensified diplomatic and economic pressure on the regime, and to engage with Syrian opposition groups committed to a democratic future’.","City being bombarded to stop uprising against ruling regime .

"By . Liz Hull . Last updated at 9:57 AM on 9th February 2012 . To his victims he was an Italian aristocrat, a tragic cancer sufferer, an IT executive, even a songwriter for a famous rock band. In reality, Scott Travis was nothing more than a jobless conman living on benefits in a shabby council flat in Rochdale. The smooth-talking chancer constructed a web of lies and fake identities – including Viscount Franco Dibella III – to swindle his girlfriend and a pensioner out of hundreds of thousands of pounds. Fraudster: Scott Travis (left) posed as an Italian millionaire to con his elderly victim, as well as his own girlfriend Gail Heyworth (right) His charades allowed him to buy a . £50,000 Lexus car, have cosmetic surgery and stay for six weeks in a . £200-a-night hotel alongside showbusiness stars. He enjoyed weekends in Monte Carlo, . employed a chauffeur, drank £80 bottles of Bollinger champagne and wore . suits from designer boutiques. Among his lies, the 44-year-old even . claimed to be awaiting a fortune in royalties after writing songs for . the British rock band Whitesnake. Last night, however, Travis was . facing up to life behind bars after a jury took just ten minutes to . convict him of stealing the £100,000 life savings of an elderly man he . conned by pretending to have cancer. The scam saw him befriend the victim, . whose identity was protected by a judge, over seven years and persuade . him to hand over cash for specialist treatment. On one occasion, he even arrived at the man’s home with a bandaged head, claiming to have just had a brain tumour removed. When the man became suspicious, . Travis, who police believe has been known by at least four fake . identities and once changed his name by deedpoll, claimed he needed more . cash because he was being threatened by gangsters over unpaid loans. Minshull Street Crown Court, . Manchester, was told the conman dreamed up his life of lies after being . duped by his family over the identity of his mother. Conman: Scott Travis tries to dodge photographers after appearing at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, last month . The hearing was told that his mother . was just 15 when she gave birth to him in 1967, but her parents were so . embarrassed that they secretly brought him up in the Greater Manchester . town as their own – allowing him to believe his mother was his sister. When, aged 18, he found out the truth he was broken-hearted, the court was told. Travis was first exposed as a liar in . 2005 when he was jailed for 16 months after he pretended to be his . girlfriend, Gail Heyworth, 50, to secure a £7,500 loan. He even imitated . a woman’s voice when he spoke to brokers from the company on the . telephone. He also stole a winter heating cheque . from Miss Heyworth’s 67-year old father and used the pensioner’s . details to obtain mobile phones and credit cards. Another scam saw Travis pretend to be . the manager of a computer firm earning £35,000 a year to secure a car . loan, while claiming benefits under another false name. The conman sowed the seeds for his . latest fraud in 2003 when he befriended his elderly victim after reading . a newspaper advert the pensioner had placed seeking companionship. The millionaire lifestyle: Travis lived in this block of flats in Manchester . Posing as ‘Franco’, the orphan son of . an Italian aristocrat who was set to inherit millions, Travis begged . the man for £20,000 for cancer treatment, plus another £9,000 to pay off . a gangster. The pensioner initially went to police, who warned him he might be the victim of a conman, but he decided not to press charges. Later, Travis returned and claimed he . needed a further £35,000 to release cash from the will of his mother, . whom he said had died in a car crash in Naples. He even paid a friend £500 to pose as . a gangster who went to the pensioner’s home saying he was going to hurt . ‘Franco’ unless the victim paid £30,000. The pensioner later told police: ‘He . was very angry. He said: “If you don’t get my money I’ll shoot you and . him.” I was scared to death.’ The court also heard from a taxi . driver paid to act as chauffeur for Travis only to be left with an . unpaid bill of £1,265. ‘I fell hook, line and sinker for the lies told . by him,’ he said. ‘His stories were so good, anybody would have believed . them. I felt used, abused and foolish.’ Travis, who was convicted of four . offences of obtaining money orders by deception, one of fraud and two . offences of blackmail, will be sentenced tomorrow.","Scott Travis used fake name 'Franco Verradi III'

"By . Arthur Martin . Last updated at 12:42 AM on 9th February 2012 . A classic car restorer has drowned after jumping into a freezing pond to rescue his beloved labrador. Tim Waddingham, 53, was walking on a snow-covered golf course next to his home when his dog Podge wandered on to a frozen pond. The five-year-old labrador is thought to have fallen through thin ice into the freezing water. Tim Waddingham, 53, died after trying to rescue his dog in a lake on a golf course in Cranleigh, Surrey. His body was later discovered by police divers . Frozen scene: The lake at the Wildwood Golf and Country Park in Cranleigh, Surrey where Mr Waddingham drowned . Fearing for his dog, Mr Waddingham took some of his clothes off and jumped into the pond to rescue it. During the rescue attempt he got into difficulty and drowned as his dog swam to safety. When Mr Waddingham, a former amateur Jaguar car racer, failed to return home an hour later, his wife Sarah, 37, went looking for him on the golf course. She came across Podge sitting on her husband’s clothes next to the pond shortly after 9am on Sunday, a close family friend said. The Oldfield family watched their . beloved King Charles spaniel Alfie die in a frozen pond in Cheshire . because firefighters there didn’t have a raft or water rescue training. The Macclesfield fire service arrived on the scene but it was almost 20 minutes for a specialist trained crew from Knutsford. Meanwhile . Alfie gripped the edge of the broken ice, whimpering and crying. By the . time the second crew turned up, the exhausted dog slipped into the . freezing water. The Knutsford team eventually got six-year-old Alfie out of the water and gave him oxygen, but vets were unable to save him. Alfie’s . owner, mother-of-three Julie Oldfield, from Macclesfield, said: 'Alfie . was desperately trying to get out. He was crying and barking for 40 . minutes. 'We were so relieved when the fire engine turned up - but they couldn’t go in. They said they didn’t have a raft or training. 'We just had to watch from the side. It was horrific, we felt so useless. Our children are traumatised.' 'There were hundreds of children there - it could have been one of them. What then?' Police divers later recovered Mr Waddingham’s body. He was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. Yesterday relatives were trying to comfort his wife and their seven-year-old daughter Louisa at the £1.5million family home in West Sussex. Speaking outside the gates of the farmhouse, a relative said: ‘It was an act of reckless foolishness that was done for love. He left the house in the morning contented. It was a wrong decision to go and help the dog at this time of year. The family are all cut up dreadfully.’ Mr Waddingham, who ran a classic car restoration firm specialising in Jaguars from his home, regularly walked his dog at the golf club. There are  several water features on its three nine-hole courses. Photographer Max Grizaard, 53, a former school friend who was Mr Waddingham’s best man, said the death was ‘a tragedy for everyone who knew and loved Tim’. Robert Coucher, the international editor of classic car magazine Octane, said he met Mr Waddingham in 2006 when he asked him to restore a 1955 Jaguar XK140. ‘Tim was one of the foremost experts when it came to classic cars, especially Jaguars,’ he said. ‘He knew everything there was to know about Jaguars. He was a very skilled engineer and he had clients all over the world.’ Yesterday after conducting a post mortem examination a pathologist gave the cause of death as drowning. An inquest was opened and adjourned. A police spokesman said: ‘Officers are investigating. At this stage it is believed there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.’ Up to three inches of snow are expected to fall this evening on the Midlands, Lincolnshire and East Anglia. London, the South and parts of Yorkshire are due to get up to 1.5 inches. Temperatures will plunge as low as minus 7c (19f) in central and eastern England tomorrow night, and daytime levels will struggle to rise above minus 1c (30f) in some parts of the country. Wildwood Golf and Country Club in Cranleigh, Surrey. Mr Waddingham drowned in a lake near the club . Forecasters are warning that low temperatures will cause a ‘slow thaw’ leaving the snow on the ground well into the weekend. The cold snap is expected to have relaxed its grip by Sunday, although night-time temperatures will still fall below zero in parts of England into next week. Despite freezing conditions over most of England, much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are experiencing milder weather. ● Former footballer David Ginola has broken three ribs in a skiing accident in the French Alps.

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 5:44 AM on 8th February 2012 . Under investigation: The FBI is probing possible criminal violations by Rupert Murdoch's staff . Rupert Murdoch's media empire is today under a stepped-up U.S. investigation and FBI inquiry into possible violations by employees of a U.S. law banning corrupt payments to foreign officials. But U.S. investigators have found little to substantiate allegations of phone hacking inside the country by the media mogul’s journalists, law enforcement and corporate sources said. The FBI is probing possible criminal violations by Mr Murdoch’s staff of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a law intended to curb payment of bribes by U.S. companies to foreign officials. If any action was pursued by U.S. authorities against Murdoch employees, it would most likely relate to . the FCPA, a U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters. If the company is found to have . violated the FCPA, Murdoch's News Corp, which has its base in New York, . could be fined up to $2million and barred from U.S. government . contracts. Individuals who took part in the . bribery could face fines of up to $100,000 and five years' jail. Executives could be liable if they authorised bribes or knew about the . practice but failed to stop it. In practice, U.S. authorities have . usually settled FCPA cases in return for large cash payments from . companies, who can sometimes avoid legal admissions of guilt. Home: If the company is found to have violated the FCPA, Murdoch's News Corp, which has its base in New York, pictured, could be fined up to $2million and barred from U.S. government contracts . Much of the evidence was handed over . by the company, who have set up a clean-up unit in London and hired . lawyers in Britain and the U.S., some of whom are FCPA specialists, . company sources said. The U.S. Justice Department and . Securities and Exchange Commission also have jurisdiction to pursue . civil cases against alleged violators of the law. Bloomberg reported last year that . Justice Department prosecutors sent News Corp a request for details on . alleged payments which journalists made to British police officers in . return for news tips. Sources close to News Corp have . discussed the Management Standards Committee of News International . (MSC), the unit set up to deal with phone hacking and related . investigations. It has for some time been concerned . about the consequences of U.S. investigations of possible FCPA . violations, the sources said. Both News International and News Corp . declined to comment. Last July, the company retained Mark . Mendelsohn, who served as deputy chief of the Fraud Section in the . Criminal Division of the U.S. Justice Department. Hacking claim: Law enforcement and corporate sources said no evidence had turned up that journalists from Mr Murdoch's now defunct News of the World sought to hack into voicemail messages of victims of 9/11 . Mr Mendelsohn, now in private . practice, was internationally respected as an architect of the DOJ's . Foreign Corrupt Practices Act enforcement programme. News Corp sources confirmed that the . Management Standards Committee was also working with Williams & . Connolly, a prominent Washington law firm specialising in white-collar . crime cases. U.S. authorities reportedly found nothing to support claims that potentially illegal reporting tactics allegedly widespread in Britain were also employed by Mr Murdoch’s journalists in the U.S. Law enforcement and corporate sources said no evidence had turned up to corroborate a Daily Mirror accusation over journalists from Mr Murdoch's now-defunct News of the World. The Mirror claimed the NOTW reporters sought to hack into voicemail messages of victims of the Al Qaeda 9/11 attacks on the U.S. The Mirror is a competitor of Mr Murdoch's London tabloid, The Sun. The New York Times reported last year . that one of the lawyers working on the News Corp case was Brendan . Sullivan, a Williams & Connolly partner. He is known for his public defence of . White House aide Oliver North during Congressional investigations into . an arms-for-hostages scandal during the time of U.S. President Ronald . Reagan. News Corp announced last month that . another Williams & Connolly partner, Gerson Zweifach, would become . its top new in-house lawyer. He is also expected to join the MSC. Company sources said that, via the . MSC, News International was routinely sharing with its outside lawyers . evidence which had been uncovered of suspected questionable practices. Among evidence turned over by the . company to British authorities are emails and financial records which . allegedly chart the payment of more than $158,000 to police contacts, . mostly in small sums. A company source said the records . showed many or most of the payments intended recipients were listed in . company records under false names. Arrested but not charged: To date, no criminal charges have been filed against any of the individuals arrested over the past year, who include former News International CEO Rebekah Brooks, left, and Andy Coulson, right . London's Metropolitan Police has been . probing suspected abusive practices which journalists at the News of the . World and other Murdoch London papers allegedly routinely employed in . recent years. British detectives are conducting . three parallel investigations. One inquiry, known as Operation Weeting, . is investigating alleged phone hacking. A second inquiry, Operation Tuleta, is . probing computer hacking claims. The third, Operation Elveden, is . investigating allegations that journalists paid police officers bribes . in return for tipoffs. The head of the three investigations said this week she was increasing the number of police looking at police payments. London police have arrested 30 people, . including journalists and police officers, in connection with its three . journalism-related investigations. Long story: Current probes trace their roots back to the 2006 arrests, and guilty pleas, of NOTW royal reporter Clive Goodman, left, and private detective Glenn Mulcaire, right on phone hacking charges . Last month, four current and former . journalists on The Sun, as well as a serving police officer, were . arrested in connection with Operation Elveden. Sue Akers, the officer in charge of . all the investigations, said on Monday that 14 people so far had been . arrested in connection with Operation Elveden. But she indicated that more investigators were likely to be added to the inquiry, which she said still had some time to run. To date, no criminal charges have been . filed against any of the individuals arrested over the past year, who . include Rebekah Brooks, a former CEO of Murdoch's London papers. Andy Coulson, a former Murdoch editor . who became top media adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron, was also . arrested but not charged to date.

"By . Rebecca Camber . Last updated at 12:35 AM on 9th February 2012 . Scotland Yard declared war on gangs yesterday as it emerged they are responsible for half of London’s shootings and one in seven rapes. Police said 4,800 gangsters were to blame for almost a quarter of the capital’s serious violence, a sixth of all robberies, 16 per cent of the drug trade and 20 per cent of stabbings. The figures came as the Met unveiled a £60million taskforce to crack down on the problem. Raid: Metropolitan Police officers prepare to enter an address in east London this morning as they launch a crackdown on gang members . New Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe is expanding the existing  Trident squad, increasing its remit from probing shootings in the black community to all gangs. The force is also doubling the number of officers dedicated to gang crime from 450 to 1,000. Police are aware of 435 ‘crews’ operating in London, but only 250 are criminally active. Of those, 62 are categorised as posing a risk of ‘high harm’ and are estimated to be behind two thirds of gang-related offences. According to the crime figures, 480 rapes or 14 per cent of the 3,431 sex attacks in London every year are carried out by known gang members. Crackdown: Scotland Yard have almost doubled the number of officers tackling gang crime. This morning they carried out 144 raids across the capital . Raid: A police officer emerges from a house in east London which was raided by the Metropolitan Police this morning . Crackdown: Mayor Boris Johnson with Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe in Trafalgar Square today as Scotland Yard launch their new Gang Crime Command . They also account for 22 per cent of serious violence, 20 per cent of stabbings and 247 out of the 547 shootings during 2011. More than 6,200 personal robberies and 40 per cent of all commercial premises and ‘cash in transit’  thefts can also be traced back to the 4,800 criminals. And they have been blamed for 26 per cent of aggravated burglary and 12 per cent of residential burglaries, which is equivalent to 7,650 break-ins a year. Some of the criminals responsible are as young as 14, with a third of those shot aged under 19. Do not cross: Mr Johnson and Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe launch the Trident Gang Crime Command which marks what senior officers have described as a 'step change' in the way the force tackles gangs . Statistics show that 84 per cent of gang members are under 24 and two-thirds of those are black males. Detectives believe the number of girls joining gangs is rising, although they only represent 5 per cent of offenders. Between 2008 and 2010, the victims of London shootings hailed from 53 different countries. Yesterday, as officers arrested 213 suspects in a series of raids, the Met announced it would be working with the UK Border Agency to deport any foreign gang members. The Commissioner pledged to use ‘all tactics, if legal and ethical’, to tackle the problem. His new squad will draw officers from other specialist units, including the Flying Squad and homicide. Mr Hogan-Howe said: ‘This is a step change in how we tackle gang crime in London. It will allow us to identify and relentlessly pursue the most harmful gangs and gang members. ‘We want to prevent young people getting involved in gang offending so we and other agencies are offering ways out to support young people. ‘However, those who refuse our offer of help will be pursued and brought to justice.’ Gang victim: Agnes Sina-Inakoju who was buying a takeaway pizza when she was killed . The brother of a schoolgirl gunned down in a takeaway has urged gang members to help prevent more deaths by coming forward with information. Agnes Sina-Inakoju, 16, who dreamed of going to Oxford University, was the innocent victim of a gang feud. She was going to buy pizza from a takeaway in Hoxton, east London, in April 2010 when she was killed. Leon Dunkley and Mohammed Smoured, members of the London . Fields gang, decided to target the shop believing members of the rival . Hoxton Boys would be there. Instead, she was shot dead. Her brother Abiola Adesina, 33, said: . 'In movies the bad things always catch up with the bad guys. They live . life fine for a few years. People in gangs should be asked whether they . want this. 'Do they want to live fine for a few years and then be destroyed for the rest of their life or killed? 'Do they actually think about their friends, their family, their parents? Do they know what effect that will have on them? 'Children learn their boundaries as they grow. They will do things once and, if you don’t stop them, they’ll do it again.' Describing the moment he found out . about his sister’s death, Mr Adesina said: 'I was watching TV and I . heard on the news that someone had been shot in Hoxton and the first . thing that came into my head was ""oh my god, that was very close to my . house"". Convicted: Leon Dunkley (left) and Mohammed Smoured who were jailed for life for the murder of Agnes Sina-Inakoju . 'There were no pictures or names ... then a few minutes later someone called me and said, ""I’m sorry about your sister"". 'My mum hadn’t called me to tell me the news straight away. We were told she was going to be fine.' Agnes, who would have turned 18 this September, was taken to hospital but died two days later. Last year, gunman Dunkley, 22, and . look-out Smoured, 21, were jailed for life with minimum terms of 32 . years each for her murder. A third gang member was spared jail after he gave key evidence against the killers. Judge Peter Beaumont, the Recorder of . London, said that in the 'exceptional' circumstances he would instead . make a three-year youth rehabilitation order despite the youngster . admitting gun and drug offences. He said if jurors had not believed the witness’s evidence 'those men would not be serving the sentences that they are today'.

"By . Victoria Allen . Last updated at 9:29 PM on 8th February 2012 . A man who became a global internet sensation after he was caught on camera throwing an apparent fare-dodger off a train will not be prosecuted, it emerged last night. Alan Pollock was captured hauling Sam Main out his seat and hurling him onto the station platform after intervening in an argument between the student and a conductor. Rail worker Alan Mitchell claimed the teenager did not have a valid ticket for the journey - sparking a foul-mouthed rant from the student, who insisted he did. Alan Pollock has refused to speak about what's being called 'Big Man Gate' Sam Main has not been charged, but has been reported for threatening and abusive behaviour, and for trespass . The incident was captured on a camera-phone by a fellow passenger and quickly appeared on on-line video-sharing website YouTube, where it has been viewed more than two million times. Mr Pollock, 35, who soon became known as the ‘Big Man’, was applauded by most of his fellow passengers for stepping in but he was landed with an assault charge after 19-year-old Mr Main reported him to the police. But yesterday, after almost two months with a potential court case hanging over his head, the Crown Office announced its decision to drop the charge as it was not in the public interest. Mr Main was never charged but was reported to the procurator fiscal for threatening and abusive behaviour and trespass. He will also escape prosecution. The reprieve for businessman and father of three Mr Pollock was met with delight by his thousands of supporters. Labour justice spokesman Lewis Macdonald said: ‘I am pleased that common sense has finally prevailed. ‘Too many people suffer abuse and intimidation at work and it would be a sad day if members of the public were sent the message that it is wrong to stand up for workers.’ Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ‘I’m glad this is over. Respect between staff and passengers is something we should all encourage. I’m sure this incident will be a reminder to us all of the importance of this traditional value.’ Meanwhole, Conservative justice spokesman David McLetchie added: ‘The Procurator Fiscal has come to a very sensible decision on this matter and I welcome that there will not be a prosecution.’ Mr Pollock could not be contacted last night. He has moved from his rented home in Queens Haugh, Stirling, after becoming an unwitting local celebrity. Is there a problem? After the conductor has been remonstrating with the teenager the 'Big Man' stands up and approaches the conductor . Time to move on, son: The burly passenger looks down on the teenager before pushing him to the train door . But his father, retired accountant Jim, from Wishaw, Lanarkshire, said: ‘It’s like the nightmare is over. It’s very good news, I’m glad to hear it. ‘We don’t have this hanging over our heads any more.’ The video of the events, which unfolded on December 9 on the Edinburgh to Perth train, has now been watched on YouTube an astonishing two million times, by people all around the world. It was captured on a mobile phone by fellow passenger Ian Hems, who looked on as building surveying student Mr Main argued with 63-year-old conductor Alan Mitchell. Mr Main did not have a ticket, which he later blamed on a mistake at Edinburgh Waverley, where he boarded a train after an exam at Heriot Watt University. He was asked to get off the train but refused – launching into a foul-mouthed rant in front of a mother and two young children sat nearby. The conductor is shown reasoning with the teenager before Mr Pollock stands up, asking: ‘Do you want me to get him off for you?’ The investment manager at Black Rock in Edinburgh then bundles Mr Main off the train, twice pushing him back, when he tries to reboard. The video ends with the train carriage erupting in applause. Many have championed Mr Pollock, claiming his was an act of public service and even offering to pay his legal bills if the assault charge made it to court. However, others argued that he went too far. Mr Pollock has stayed silent, even after being charged with assault by British Transport Police. The conductor, 63-year-old Alan Mitchell, was back at work this week after being signed off for six weeks on sick leave, but faces no disciplinary action. Off and away: The 'big man' hoists the youth up from his seat and throws him off the train . And out you go: The passenger pushes the teenager on to the platform. Each time he tries to get back in, he pushes him back out again . Mr Main was the subject of a report to the procurator fiscal under section 38 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing Act 2010 (threatening and abusive behaviour) and trespass, after apparently going onto the railway line to retrieve a lost possession. In the wake of the incident, he launched a media offensive to defend himself, claiming he was just desperate to get home, being diabetic and having not eaten all day. He has repeatedly called for Mr Pollock to face prosecution but was not at home last night to give his reaction. His mother, Angela, speaking from their Falkirk home, said he had believed the older man would face court but would not be commenting further – adding ‘he’s been through enough’. The Crown Office confirmed neither Mr Main nor Pollock would be given any warning or fine. A spokesman said: ‘The Procurator Fiscal at Livingston received reports concerning two males aged 35 and 19, in connection with an incident in Linlithgow on Friday 9 December 2011. ‘After full and careful consideration of the reports by Crown Counsel, it was decided that it is not in the public interest to prosecute either male and the cases are now closed.’","'Fare-dodger' student Sam Main also escapes prosecution .

Riots: Maldivian policemen try to take cover as protestors who were demanding former leader Mohamed Nasheed be reinstated throw back a tear gas canister at them . Damage: Mr Nasheed's supporters began rioting, throwing fire bombs and vandalizing a private TV station that had been critical of Nasheed's government . Protests against new president: 'If the police are going to confront us we are going to face them,' Mr Nasheed told the rally. 'We have to overcome our fear and we have to get strength' There was no immediate comment from police. Mr Nasheed, the nation's first democratically elected president, said he was forced to resign at gunpoint Tuesday in what he termed a coup. He demanded his successor resign and he promised to fight to return to office. 'We will come to power again,' Mr Nasheed said. 'We will never step back. I will not accept this coup and . will bring justice to the Maldivians.' President . Mohammed Waheed Hassan, the former vice president, took office when Mr . Nasheed resigned after police joined relentless street protests against . his government. Addressing a news conference Wednesday, Mr Hassan denied claims there was a coup or a plot to oust Nasheed. Resigned: Mr Nasheed, the nation's first democratically elected president, said he was forced to resign at gunpoint Tuesday in what he termed a coup . The former leaders supporters cheered as he arrived for the Maldivian Democratic Party's meeting in Male today, although it later turned more dangerous when Mr Nasheed led an anti-government demonstration and police responded with tear gas . Unity: Supporters of ousted Maldivian President Mohamed Nasheed march towards the police headquarters during a protest in Male earlier today . He said he had not prepared to take over the country and he called for the creation of a unity coalition to help it recover. 'Together, I am confident, we'll be able to build a stable and democratic country,' he said, adding that his government intended to respect the rule of law. Later in the day, he appeared to be consolidating his power by appointing a new military chief and police commissioner. Mr Nasheed insisted he was pushed from power by the armed forces. 'I was forced to resign with guns all around me. They told me, if I don't resign, they won't hesitate to use arms,' he said. Speaking to about 2,000 wildly . cheering members of his MDP in the capital, Male, he called for Hassan's . immediate resignation and demanded the nation's top judge investigate . those he said were responsible for his ouster. Mr Nasheed then led an anti-government demonstration. Police responded by firing tear gas. 'If . the police are going to confront us we are going to face them,' Mr Nasheed . told the rally. 'We have to overcome our fear and we have to get . strength.' Mr Nasheed's . supporters began rioting, throwing fire bombs and vandalizing a private . TV station that had been critical of his government. Hassan, . who had promised to protect Mr Nasheed from retribution, said his . predecessor was not under any restriction and was free to leave the . country. However, he said he would not interfere with any police or . court action against Mr Nasheed.

New leader: Mohammed Waheed Hassan, second left, who previously worked as a top UNICEF official, is sworn in as Maldives new president yesterday afternoon . Police were investigating the discovery of at least 100 bottles of alcohol inside a truck removing garbage Tuesday from the presidential residence as Mr Nasheed prepared to relinquish power, said police spokesman Ahmed Shyam. Consuming alcohol outside tourist resorts is a crime in this Muslim nation. If charged and convicted of possession of alcohol, Mr Nasheed could be sent to jail for three years, banished to a distant island, placed under house arrest or fined. Mr Nasheed presented his resignation in a nationally televised address after police joined demonstrators who had spent weeks protesting his decision to arrest a top judge and then clashed with soldiers in the streets. Some of the soldiers then defected to the police side. Mr Nasheed's party insisted his ouster was engineered by rogue elements of the police and supporters of the country's former autocratic leader. Others blamed Islamic extremists.Mr Nasheed defended his government. 'I did not want wealth or to continue in the presidency, but I wanted to bring good governance,' he said. The dueling leaders ran as a ticket in the nation's first multiparty elections in 2008 after Mr Nasheed's MDP formed a coalition with Hassan's Gaumee Itthihaad Party, or National Unity Party. In a news conference Wednesday, Mr Hassan sought to tamp down fears that Islamists were gaining power. 'They are part of the society; you can't ignore them,' he said. 'But there are wide range of people with different views, philosophies and ideas about politics. I am planning to create a plural multiparty government.' He also worked to reassure the vital tourism industry that the country, known for its stunning beaches and lavish resorts, remained a peaceful place to visit. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement he hoped Mr Nasheed's resignation would lead to a peaceful resolution of the political crisis. Holiday paradise: In a news conference today, Hassan also worked to reassure the vital tourism industry that the country, known for its stunning beaches and lavish resorts, remained a peaceful place to visit . U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Oscar Fernandez-Taranco is scheduled to lead a U.N. team to the country later this week to help the Maldives resolve its political tensions. Mr Nasheed's resignation marked a stunning fall for the former human rights campaigner who defeated the nation's longtime ruler, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, in the country's first multiparty elections in 2008. Mr Nasheed was also an environmental celebrity calling for global action to combat the climate change that could raise sea levels and inundate his archipelago nation. Over the past year, Mr Nasheed was battered by protests over soaring prices and demands for more religiously conservative policies. Travellers planning to visit the Maldives for a spot of winter relaxation have been advised to take care and the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has updated its advice on visits to the capital Malé. The FCO is currently advising ‘against all but essential travel to Malé Island’, explaining that ‘there are political demonstrations in the capital Malé, which have resulted in violent clashes between government and opposition supporters, and the police and defence forces.’ ‘The situation remains uncertain,’ the guidelines continue. ‘If you are in Malé, or choose to travel to Malé, you should exercise caution, avoid demonstrations and beware of spontaneous gatherings.’","Police beat up former leader Mohamed Nasheed according to Maldivian Democratic Party officials .

"By . Luke Salkeld . Last updated at 7:37 AM on 18th November 2011 . Battle: Bronwen Davies had to go to court to win a £164 refund for four months' fees from a gym owned by millionaire businessman Duncan Bannatyne . Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne has become embroiled in an undignified row with a recovering cancer patient whom he has banned from his health clubs. The entrepreneur, who is reported  to be worth £430million, acted after  Bronwen Davies, 60, won a £164 refund in a court battle over charges for her Bannatyne’s gym membership while she was undergoing treatment. In a letter, the owner of the health club empire said he was ‘not prepared to ever re-accept’ Mrs Davies as a member. He also used his Twitter account to accuse her of being ‘disruptive’. Mrs Davies was diagnosed with cancer of the tonsils and attempted to suspend her  £41-a-month membership of the gym while she was unable to use its facilities because she was undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She said she put the request in writing, and asked her husband to prolong the temporary cancellation while she was ill. After reimbursing her for one of the months for which payment was taken, however, the gym continued to charge for another four months’ membership. She later wrote to the company several times – including to Bannatyne himself – but then took the issue to the Office of Fair Trading and eventually the county court, which ruled in her favour.

Keen to re-join the gym in Cardiff, where she had been a member for five years, Mrs Davies then received a letter from Bannatyne, stating that this would not be allowed. It read: ‘Whilst I do not agree with the Court’s decision or its interpretation of our membership agreement and policies, I’m willing to accept its decision. ‘However, I am not prepared to ever re-accept you as a member at any of Bannatyne Group’s health clubs because I strongly disagree with your conduct.’ The tycoon, 62, then took to  Twitter to attack Mrs Davies,  telling his 444,000 followers: ‘Only  a complete moron would believe that story.’ He then wrote: ‘What can I do? Sue a cancer survivor for lying?’ The gym in Cardiff owned by Duncan Bannatyne where Bronwen Davies was a member . He added: ‘She is very good at getting sympathy but disruptive to my club so therefore banned.’ Yesterday Mrs Davies, a mother of two, who is now in remission, said going to court had a damaging effect on her fragile health after the cancer treatment in 2009. She said: ‘This court case just added to my stress. I was really very unwell. I looked like something out of the Holocaust and certainly couldn’t go to a gym. ‘I was severely malnourished and there were times when I didn’t think I was going to make it.’ But, she said: ‘I would like to  go back to the gym to help me recover...I’m just disappointed, really disappointed that a man of his standing and a national club can behave in such a vindictive  and petty way.’ A spokesman for the Bannatyne Group said: ‘The lady’s membership was revoked because she  was disruptive.’ He added: ‘The group supports numerous cancer charities and sympathises with the plight of cancer sufferers.’",Dragons' Den star left furious and brands 60-year-old nurse a 'liar' on Twitter .
