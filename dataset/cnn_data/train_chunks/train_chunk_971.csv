"Josh Gordon . Cleveland Browns star wide receiver Josh Gordon has been reinstated into the NFL and had his one-year suspension reduced to 10 games after the league announced changes to its drug policy. The league and Players' Association reached an agreement on Friday on revisions to the substance-abuse program. Earlier this week, they announced changes on performance-enhancing drugs. Gordon, who has at least four drug violations, has already served two games of the suspension. He will be eligible to play November 23 when the Browns visit Atlanta. Gordon's appeal of a season-long ban was upheld on Aug. 22. Under the new provisions, Gordon will be allowed to work out and attend team meetings. Before the changes, Gordon was only permitted to meet with his clinician at the team's facility. Despite being suspended for two games last season, Gordon led the league with 1,646 yards receiving.","Cleveland Browns star wide receiver Josh Gordon has been reinstated into the NFL .

"Commissioner Roger Goodell says the NFL wants to implement new personal conduct policies by the Super Bowl. At a news conference Friday, Goodell made his first public statements in more than a week about the rash of NFL players involved in domestic violence. He did not announce any specific changes, but said he has not considered resigning. 'Unfortunately, over the past several weeks, we have seen all too much of the NFL doing wrong,' he said. 'That starts with me.' Roger Goodell apologised and vowed to make changes in the NFL in his speech to the media in New York . The league has faced increasing criticism that it has not acted quickly or emphatically enough concerning the domestic abuse cases. The commissioner reiterated that he botched the handling of the Ray Rice case. 'The same mistakes can never be repeated,' he said. Goodell now oversees all personal conduct cases, deciding guilt and penalties. The commissioner and some NFL teams have been heavily criticized for lenient or delayed punishment of Rice, Adrian Peterson and other players involved in recent domestic violence cases. Less than three weeks into the season, five such cases have made headlines, the others involving Greg Hardy, Ray McDonald and Jonathan Dwyer. Minnesota Vikings' star Adrian Peterson has been placed on the exempt-commissioner's permission list . The Ravens released Ray Rice (right) and the NFL indefinitely suspended him after assaulting his then-fiancee . Vikings star running back Peterson, Carolina defensive end Hardy and Arizona running back Dwyer are on a special commissioner's exemption list and are being paid while they go through the legal process. McDonald, a defensive end for San Francisco, continues to practice and play while being investigated on suspicion of domestic violence. As these cases have come to light, such groups as the National Organization of Women and league partners and sponsors have come down hard on the NFL to be more responsive in dealing with them. Congress also is watching to see how the NFL reacts. In response to the criticism, the NFL announced it is partnering with a domestic violence hotline and a sexual violence resource centre. The Panthers removed Greg Hardy from their active roster until his domestic violence case is resolved . Ray McDonald continues to practice and play while being investigated on suspicion of domestic violence . Goodell also said in a memo to the clubs late Thursday that within the next 30 days, all NFL and team personnel will participate in education sessions on domestic violence and sexual assault. The memo said the league will work with the union in providing the 'information and tools to understand and recognize domestic violence and sexual assault.' The league will provide financial, operational and promotional support to the National Domestic Violence Hotline and the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.","'Unfortunately, over the past several weeks, we have seen all too much of the NFL doing wrong,' he said.

"The judge in the Oscar Pistorius trial has been placed under police protection after her decision to acquit the athlete murder sparked anger around the world. Several legal groups in South Africa have expressed concern about threats and harsh criticism of Judge Thokozile Masipa which they say could amount to racism and contempt of court. Judge Masipa, one of the first black female judges in South Africa, last week found Pistorius guilty of culpable homicide, but not guilty of the more serious charge of murder. Scroll down for video . South African Judge Thokozile Masipa (pictured delivering her verdicts) has been placed under police protection after receiving threats over her decision to acquit Oscar Pistorius of murder . Some South Africans said they were surprised and even shocked when she ruled last week that the Paralympic champion was negligent but did not intend to kill when he fatally shot girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp through a closed toilet door. Pistorius said he thought a dangerous intruder was in his house. Prosecutors alleged he intentionally killed Steenkamp after an argument. Police protection for Masipa has been stepped up since the verdict on Friday in the sensational case, South African media reported. The case will return to the global spotlight when Pistorius, who is free on bail, appears before the judge for a sentencing hearing on October 13. In a statement, three legal groups described a 'wave of criticism' directed at Masipa that in some cases could border on hate speech, defamation and contempt of court. Pistorius leaves the court in Pretoria after being cleared of the murder of Reeva Steenkamp, but found guilty of culpable homicide and has been granted bail until being sentenced next month . The comments include allegations that the judge is corrupt, as well as attacks on her race and gender. 'In judging, there's a lot of analysis of the information before the court and applying the law to what is before you,' Thabang Pooe, a researcher at legal group SECTION27, said today. 'Attacking the judge's integrity and making insinuations of bribery or that she's not fit because she's a woman, or that she's black, means that you're breaking down the belief in the law.' Masipa, 66, is a former social worker and journalist who became one of the first black female judges in South Africa, which shed white racist rule in 1994. Her supporters have described her as a symbol of accomplishment in a country where poverty and unemployment remain obstacles for many people. The legal groups, including SECTION27, the Legal Resources Centre and the Centre for Child Law, said people are entitled to disagree with the verdict and that the prosecution can appeal. South African media react to the decision not to convict the Paralympian of murder . Prosecutors have said they will decide whether to appeal after sentencing. The sentence for a culpable homicide conviction is at the judge's discretion and can range from a suspended sentence and a fine to as much as 15 years in prison. Legal experts have cited five years as a guideline. Many legal analysts agreed with the judge's ruling that Pistorius could not be found guilty of premeditated murder. But some believe the law supported a conviction on a lesser murder charge on the grounds that Pistorius knew someone - in his version, a perceived intruder - was behind the toilet door and also knew that firing four bullets into the door could cause that person's death. James Grant, an associate professor of law at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, said in an online analysis that 'there appear to be errors of law' in Masipa's judgment. 'The effect is that, if the state does appeal, and one may well expect that it will, Pistorius continues to face the prospect of a murder conviction,' Grant wrote. Meanwhile, South African sports officials . have said Pistorius can compete for South Africa again, as long as his . running doesn't go against the ruling of the judge.","Judge Masipa criticised for only convicting Paralympian of manslaughter .

"A University of Cincinnati football staffer has found himself without a job and facing a sex crime rap after his employers learned last week that a 73-year-old grocery store employee claims he exposed himself and touched her with his genitals in May. Antrione Archer, 28, allegedly asked for help in the pharmacy aisle in a Kenton County, Kentucky Kroger, where the employee says 'pulled his penis from his pants' and 'placed his exposed penis against her backside.' Archer was fire Tuesday after the school learned of the alleged incident. Archer has since announced plans to appeal the firing. Fired: Atrione Archer was fired from his job with the Cincinnati Bearcats after a 73-year-old grocery store employee claimed he exposed himself to her at a Kentucky Kroger and then touched her with his bare penis (his booking photo is at left) The school said in a release it learned about the arrest Friday and first put Archer on administrative leave pending an investigation. Court records in Kenton County Justice Court show a jury trial scheduled for Oct. 15, with a pretrial conference set for Monday. Archer's lawyer told the television station Archer was close to having the situation resolved through the legal system. Archer had been Director of Player Welfare and Development with Cincinnati's football program since 2011, acting as a liaison between coaches and players. In a July 2013 interview with the Bearcat Journal, Archer gave his take on player behavior off the field and on sexual misconduct, SB Nation points out. 'We talk to them about carrying themselves in the right way and being around the right people. A couple weeks ago we did a session on sexual conduct to give them some education on keeping themselves out of any situations they shouldn't be in. Luckily, we really haven't had many issues,' he said.","Antrione Archer, 28, allegedly 'pulled his penis from his pants' and 'placed his exposed penis against her backside' at a Kentucky Kroger .

"Usain Bolt has made a quick-fire U-turn to support the Commonwealth Games, after coming under fire for claiming they were ‘a bit s***t’. The Jamaican sprinter appears to have had a change of heart less than 24 hours after he reportedly criticised the Glasgow event, claiming ‘the Olympics were better’. After watching the Jamaican netball team lose to New Zealand yesterday, the 27-year-old claimed the Games were in fact ‘awesome’ and dismissed his earlier alleged negative remarks as ‘all lies’. Scroll down for video . Support: Usain Bolt (pictured with Prince Harry on Tuesday) appears to have had a change of heart and has now called the Commonwealth Games 'awesome', less than 24 hours after branding them a 'bit s***t' Not impressed: Usain Bolt has denied reports that he described the Commonwealth Games as 'a bit s***' Bolt is said to have complained about Glasgow 2014 to The Times as he waited in the rain for a car outside the athletes’ village on Tuesday, just hours after meeting the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. He apparently told a Times reporter that he was ‘not really’ having fun at the Games before branding them a ‘bit s***’. However, while the six-time Olympic champion yesterday denied making the comments, the paper has stood firmly by its story. It today published the full transcript between journalist Katie Gibbons and the athlete, with Scottish editor Angus Macleod declaring: ‘We stand by this story 100 per cent.’ Either way, there has already been a backlash – with talk that fans would turn their backs in protest when Bolt competes in the 4x100m relay heats tomorrow. Others hit back on Twitter. All smiles: Bolt shares a joke with Prince William and his wife Kate at the athletes' village on Tuesday . The Times has published the below transcript of reporter Katie Gibbons' interview with Usain Bolt. KG: Hi Usain, I’m Katie Gibbons, a reporter from The Times. Nice to meet you . UB: Hi . KG: How are you? UB: (shrugs) KG: So are you enjoying the games? Are you having fun? UB: No . KG: Really, why not?

Paul Hughes tweeted: ‘As someone who plays in a Glasgow pub band, I fear . @usainbolt may be about to discover what it is like to lose the Glasgow . audience.’ The alleged . comments also risk angering Virgin. Bolt made a reported £2million when . he signed a 2012 sponsorship deal with Virgin Media, which is also . sponsoring athletics at Glasgow 2014. But . the sprinter, who is seeking his first Commonwealth gold, tweeted . yesterday: ‘I’m waking up to this nonsense... journalist please don’t . create lies to make headlines.’ His agent also claimed the reports were . ‘utter rubbish’. However, . there was no sign of a backlash when, in a carefully stage-managed . appearance, he turned up to support the Jamaican netball team – with . crowds of fans clamouring to take a photo as he waved his country’s flag . from the stands. The Games has often been dismissed as . one of the least prestigious athletics championships. Faced with . potentially disastrous criticism, the Commonwealth Games Federation said . it was ‘pleased’ with Bolt’s response. Glasgow 2014 spokesman Jackie Brock-Doyle added: ‘I think he woke up to the story like everyone else. His tweet says it all.’ However, while the world-record holder was quick off the blocks to distance himself from any criticism of the host city, there are hints that his fellow teammates may be feeling less than enamoured with the Glasgow weather... and its food. There are suggestions that some Jamaican athletes may be struggling to appreciate the Scottish city, where the sunshine of the early days of the Games has been replaced by chill winds and drizzle. Trademark: Bolt pulls off his famous celebratory pose with Clyde the mascot and kids from Giffnock North Amateur Athletics Club . One team official also revealed there had been grumbles about the canteen, saying competitors want ‘more chicken’. Jamaican team official Rashid Hall admitted: ‘The food is different to the Caribbean. ‘It doesn’t taste like home. We want to see more chicken. We always want to see more food.’ He added: ‘The weather is tough for us.’ In comparison, New Zealand judo star Ryan Dill-Russell said he thought Glasgow 2014 had been ‘amazing’, adding: ‘Who is he [Bolt] anyway?’.","Bolt reportedly made negative remark while waiting at the athletes' village .

"Standing at only 5ft 2in tall and using a customised gun with pink cartridges, 16-year-old Amber Hill admits she is ‘not your typical shooter’. She was taught to shoot by her grandfather when she was nine years old and is a rising star in the sport. And yesterday she made her Commonwealth Games debut at Glasgow 2014, missing out on a place in the women’s skeet semi-final, in which competitors fire at clay discs, after a tense shoot-off. 'Not your typical shooter': Amber Hill is pictured yesterday releasing two pink cartridges from her gun . The BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year now has her sights set on the Rio 2016 Olympics. She bowed out of the Games gracefully, tweeting: ‘Thanks for all the support everyone!

"Frustrated holidaymakers faced long delays at airports yesterday on the first full day of increased security checks. Queues stretched outside the terminal doors at one airport because of the crackdown – brought in amid fears Al Qaeda has developed a ‘stealth bomb’ undetectable to scanners. Air passengers around the country were subjected to ‘vigorous’ body searches, with their shoes removed and swabbed for traces of explosives. Gatwick: Travellers faced delays getting inside the terminal building after the security crackdown . Queues at Manchester Airport this morning, the day after new security checks were brought in to search for so-called 'stealth bombs' which are feared to be undetectable to airport scanners . Passengers joined queues starting outside Manchester airport today, with many complaining of delays . They were also told to switch on their tablets, smartphones and laptops to prove they are not hiding something more sinister. Some customers said it took them 90 minutes just to get through security – and holidaymakers have now been warned to allow for least three hours before their flight time. Angry travellers branded the delays an ‘absolute joke’ and ‘like wading through treacle’. Airline chiefs are braced for further problems as one of the busiest weekends of the summer gets underway. The checks have been brought in due to fears that Al Qaeda’s top bomb-maker Ibrahim Al-Asiri has developed a non-metallic ‘stealth bomb’ that can be hidden inside human bodies or other devices. The use of body scanners, swabs and patting down have all been increased at UK airports while some bags are being searched twice. Passengers are removing shoes and belts as a matter of course, while those on US-bound flights are likely to face further screening and searches of bags at the boarding gates. The alert has sparked fears of a summer of travel chaos with holidaymakers facing invasive personal checks and long delays. Heathrow alone handles more than 190,000 passengers a day and across the country 24million people will fly abroad before September – 3million to the US. A spokesman for travel industry body ABTA said: ‘The main thing is to make sure that airports have sufficient measures in place to ensure all the available security gates are open.’ At Manchester Airport, officials said problems were made worse by many travellers arriving earlier than normal because of the extra checks. Some complained they were left standing outside the terminal building before they could even check in. Sam Lavelle posted pictures of fellow passengers queuing in the drop-off zone outside Terminal One, writing: ‘The queue is literally outside the door and onto the road.’ Elissa Corrigan described the wait as ‘soul destroying’. And Ian Moreno-Melgar, who was heading to Belfast for a wedding, tweeted: ‘Queuing in the car park for security isn’t normal.’ But at Heathrow passengers appeared resigned to longer and more intrusive searches as they were subjected to what one termed ‘American-style security’. Passengers wait at Heathrow Airport this morning as security staff carry out more stringent security checks . Queues to get to security at Glasgow Airport, where passengers complained of waiting times today . Christian Radnedge, who was flying to Houston, said: ‘Everyone is taking their shoes off, there are pat-downs on almost everyone after being screened, a few people are having their bags tested.’ A traveller flying to California said it was a price worth paying for ‘staying safe in a dangerous world’. And Paul Kenyon, 59, of Poynton, Cheshire, who was on his way to Bologna, said: ‘They were looking at Apple computer equipment closely and they took my washbag through the machine a couple of times as I had my contact lenses in liquid inside. ‘Nobody was moaning about the extra time and it’s not that much of a hassle. As long as you leave yourself plenty of time then you’ll get on your flight.’ Last night, traveller Matteo Pescarin posted a photo of a crammed North Terminal at Gatwick Airport as hundreds of passengers queued to go through security. Taking the chaos with good humour, David Silvester tweeted: ‘Just had my croissants x-rayed and then inspected...’ At Glasgow Airport, passengers also faced waits. Norma Decent, 59, from Stranraer, said: ‘I understand why they’re doing it, but it all seems a little excessive to me.’ Laura Macpherson, 42, from Paisley, added: ‘It’s better to be safe than sorry.’ Don't go to Syria, imams urge young Britons . Muslim leaders yesterday launched an unprecedented appeal to would-be young British jihadists: Don’t travel to fight in Syria and Iraq. Some 100 imams asked the UK’s Muslim community to help prevent radicalised youngsters joining militants abroad. Muslims should continue the ‘generous and tireless’ support for those caught up in the bloodshed – but from the UK in a ‘safe and responsible way’, they said. Chilling: British jihadists in a recruitment video aimed at youngsters in the UK . The call was made by leaders from different Islamic theological backgrounds and was echoed by imams during Friday prayers. It came as claims emerged yesterday that up to three Al Qaeda instructors tutored by master bomb-maker Ibrahim Al-Asiri are believed to have slipped in to Syria to teach British and other Europeans jihadists to make ‘stealth bombs’. And a British man who claims he has been fighting in Syria told the BBC he will not return to the UK until he can raise ‘the black flag of Islam’ over Downing Street and Buckingham Palace. Speaking with a northern accent, the man, who called himself Abu Osama, said he had received military training, making bombs and fighting with the extremist Al-Nusra Front, linked to Al Qaeda. He claimed to have been fighting for the establishment of a caliphate – which he referred to by the Arabic term Khilafah – across the Islamic world. ‘There is nothing in Britain – it is just pure evil,’ he said. ‘If and when I come back to Britain it will be when this Khilafah – this Islamic state – comes to conquer Britain and I come to raise the black flag of Islam over Downing Street, over Buckingham Palace, over Tower Bridge and over Big Ben. I don’t want to come back to what I have left behind.’ Osama said he initially faced opposition from his family but they now ‘understand that this is a good cause I am in’. It emerged yesterday that there are already believed to be three Al Qaeda instructors trained in bomb-making in Syria. It is feared they are poised to tutor young British Muslims who have travelled there in the art of making ‘invisible bombs’ – non-metallic devices that can get past airport scanners and can even be stitched inside a suicide bomber’s body. Security officers are said to have identified more than 100 of the 600 Britons currently fighting in Syria while US investigators have given their UK counterparts ‘dozens of names of interest’. However the US, which has demanded increased security at British airports, also accused the UK of ignoring for too long the threat posed by men like Osama. Frank Gaffney, former assistant secretary of defence under Ronald Reagan, said British governments ‘turned a blind eye’ to recruitment operations and ‘embraced extremists’. He said of the Western jihadists in Iraq and Syria: ‘What they learn there are the skill sets to bring violence to us.’ US officials say iPhones (left) and Samsung Galaxy phones (right) could be subject to greater checks .

"When one is the monarch, one is used to being given a comfy seat in the front row. But yesterday the Queen found herself perched several rows back as she watched the Commonwealth Games swimming heats. She was given an ordinary plastic seat and then found her view obscured by a woman in a rather large hat. The offending spectator was her own lady-in-waiting, the Hon Annabel Whitehead, who made matters worse by having chosen a very similar shade of green in which to dress. Scroll down for video . Queen Elizabeth II spent most of her time at the Commonwealth Games swimming races trying to see over her lady-in-waiting's enormous hat . Her Majesty, who had been visibly enjoying herself at the hockey earlier that day, appeared to be finding it difficult to see what was going on over the head of the Hon. Annabel Whitehead . At one point, the Queen looked somewhat dejected as she sat back in her chair glumly, left. After a while, she appeared to be giving up trying to get a better angle, right . Queen Elizabeth II spent most of her afternoon trying to improve her view - which was somewhat obscured by her lady-in-waiting's enormous green hat. As the swimming races got off to an exciting start below, she could be seen craning her neck to try and get a better view over Mrs Whitehead. The Queen began to look dejected as she dodged around her lady-in-waiting to catch a glimpse of the heats of the men's 50m and women's 100m butterfly. At one point, she even appeared to sit back in exasperation, as fellow spectators around her got heavily involved in the races. Smiles at first: Dame Whitehead speaks to the Queen as she takes her place at the the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games swimming in Tollcross Swimming Centre . The view was made difficult by her lady-in-waiting The Hon. Annabel Alice Hoyer Whitehead, who was wearing a similar - but slightly clashing - green ensemble to the Queen . The pictures were a far cry from the Queen's expressions as she watched the hockey earlier that day. During that game, she had been seen laughing and joking with fellow spectators and getting wrapped up in the drama of the game. But it seemed the Queen was too polite to ask her lady-in-waiting to move - and instead spent her time dodging around Dame Whitehead as she moved position. Dame Whitehead, 71, had already risked royal disapproval by wearing a green ensemble similar to the Queen's - which actually appeared to clash. Meanwhile, the Queen wore a green . crepe coat by Karl Ludwig, a floral silk dress and a blue hat with green . trim by Angela Kelly. She also sported a thistle brooch, one of a set of four pins gifted to her by the Sultan of Oman. The Queen looked fed up as she failed to see down to the pool and get involved in the excitement of the races . At one point, as everyone looked animated around her, the Queen appeared to look exasperated with her lack of view. She was there to watch the men's 50m and women's 100m butterfly heats . Dame Whitehead has been on the royal . lady-in-waiting circuit for some time, having been the temporary . lady-in-waiting to HRH The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon . between 1971 and 1975. She was then an extra lady-in-waiting to HRH The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon between 1975 and 1992 before becoming a Lieutenant of Royal Victorian Order (LVO) in 1986. She was again lady-in-waiting to HRH The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon between 1992 and 2002, before becoming lady-in-waiting to the Queen. The Queen expectantly took her seat as a spectator at the Commonwealth Games, but seemed to struggle settling into the plastic chair - something in which she is not particularly well-practised . It was a far cry from pictures taken earlier in the day, in which the Queen seemed to be having a great time as . she shared a joke with fellow spectators at the England versus Wales . hockey game .

"The menu at a stone age barbecue was ox ribs with bone marrow as a side dish, researchers have discovered. Ancient man liked to cook up the ribs of the auroch, a wild ox that was larger than a cow, and eat them on the spot as a ‘reward’ for the kill. He would also hack off the legs and suck out the bone marrow from the beast before carefully strimming the remainder of the meat and taking it back to camp. Meat feast: Ancient man liked to cook up the ribs of the auroch - a wild ox that was larger than, and the ancestor of, a cow - and eat them on the spot . Researchers have found that even though barbecue technology has not changed much over the years, the method of getting the meat has. Stone age man had no supermarkets to go to, so would catch his meat by setting pitfall traps then clubbing the animal on the head. The details emerged from the leftovers of a barbecue which took place7,700 years ago in the valley of the River Tjonger, Netherlands. The remains show evidence that the hunting, butchering and feasting took place even though it would be 1,000 years before farmers would bring cattle to the area. In its place would be the auroch which would be caught, skinned and partly cooked there and then. According to Discovery News, marks on the flint show how the meat was carefully separated from the bone so it could be taken back and eaten later. Burn marks however show that the ribs were eaten on the spot with ancient man so keen to have his fill he let the blade get burned in the process. Stone age man had no supermarkets to go to, so would catch his meat by setting pitfall traps then clubbing the animal on the head . Marcel Niekus, an associate professor of archaeozoology at the University of Groningen, told Discovery News: ‘The people who killed the animal lived during the Late Mesolithic (the latter part of the middle Stone Age). ‘They were hunter-gatherers and hunting game was an important part of their subsistence activities.’ While man went on to become the world’s dominant animal, the aurochs’numbers declined and the last one died at a zoo in Poland in 1627. ‘It became extinct due to the destruction of the habitat of the aurochs since the arrival of the first farmers in Europe about 7,500 years ago,’ Prummel said. ‘These farmers used the area inhabited by aurochs for their dwellings, arable fields and meadows. The aurochs gradually lost suitable habitat.’ The research was reported in the Journal of Archaeological Science.","Scientists analysed the leftovers of a barbecue which took place 7,700 years ago in the Netherlands ."
"Tennis star Caroline Wozniacki has often insisted that her love of the game comes first and she is not interested in the money her famously lucrative sport can bring. And it seems she could be telling the truth as it has been revealed that she forgot to pick up her $1.45 million check after she finished runner-up at the U.S. Open a few weeks ago. After failing to win her first Grand Slam title once again to Serena Williams, the 24-year-old accepted her trophy and fulfilled her media duties, before rushing back to her $7million Manhattan apartment. Scroll down for video . Tennis star Caroline Wozniacki  has revealed she forgot to pick up her $1.45 million check after she finished runner-up at the U.S. Open earlier this month . After failing to win her first Grand Slam title once again to Serena Williams, the 24-year-old accepted her trophy and fulfilled her media duties, before rushing off to her Manhattan apartment and then realising she did not have her winnings . But half an hour later 'she arrived back at the tennis center, a look of mild panic on her face.' 'I forgot to pick up my prize money,' she said reports Wall Street Journal. Williams walked home with the biggest paycheck ever for a single tennis tournament of $4 million. Wozniacki was later photographed at New York Fashion Week with Williams and Vogue editor Anna Wintour, so she may have had other things on her mind. 'I want to do well for myself and my sponsors...but I feel no pressure, because I don't play for the money,' she said in the interview. Wozniacki was later photographed at New York Fashion Week with Williams and Anna Wintour so she may have had other things on her mind . 'I have enough to eat, buy nice shoes,' 'For me, it's about the tennis and the trophies. I'm not motivated by money.' She also said that she does not know how much she pays her father who is her coach and closest confidant and that that she doesn't monitor her bank accounts. But the Danish tennis star, who has been sponsored by a whole host of brands including Adidas, Rolex, and Sony Ericsson, does add: 'I will do a chocolate deal for product only. No need for money.' Wozniacki, who is worth an estimated $24million - she is 11th on the all-time Women's Tennis Association career earnings list, at nearly $18.4 million. The Danish tennis star, who has been sponsored by a whole host of brands including Adidas, (right)  and Rolex (left) is worth an estimated $24million . Earlier this month she spoke about the support of female friends such as Miss Williams after her ex-fiancé golfer Rory McIlroy broke up with her over the telephone. She said: 'I went to Miami after the French Open and Serena was there and we had a great time. 'I came back from that and I felt refreshed, I felt like a new self. I started practising towards Wimbledon and I was playing well ... I think you just have to take life as it goes and I believe you never get things put on you that you can't handle. I'm definitely on the other side now – I've moved on.' But she also seemed to hit out at her former fiance, suggesting McIlroy had found it hard to balance his career with their relationship. Earlier this month she spoke about the support of female friends such as Miss Williams after her ex-fiancé golfer Rory McIlroy (pictured) broke up with her over the telephone . She added: 'I think it is very important to have a life off the court and to me it wasn't that hard to balance tennis and a relationship.' Wozniacki says she was left 'shocked' after McIlroy broke up with her but says she now intends to date a taller man. The pair split at the end of May this year, just days after the couple sent out their wedding invitations. At the time, the Northern Irish golfer said the end of the three-year relationship was 'mutual and amicable' - but now Ms Wozniacki has revealed McIlroy broke up with her out of the blue during a ten-minute call and did not even give her 'a face-to-face'. Speaking about the break-up for the first time, she told In Depth With Graham Bensinger on Yahoo! News: 'It was very hard because he made it very public from the start. He put out a press release so I didn't have a choice, you know, it just got put in my face. 'Oh I was shocked. I thought at least, you know, I would get a face to face or something. But there was nothing – it was just a phone call and I did not hear from him again. ''I don't think you expect to find yourself in a situation like that, you can't prepare yourself or your body for anything like that so I think I was in a bit of a shocked phase there for a while.' Wozniacki  hits a return during her match against Casey Dellacqua of Australia at the Wuhan Open tennis tournament in Wuhan, in China's Hubei province today . Multi-millionaire McIlroy, who won the coveted British Open in July, announced he and Ms Wozniacki had split earlier this year because he was not ready for 'all that marriage entails'. He later said in a statement released through Dublin-based communications consultants that the 'problem is mine'. At the time, he said it would be difficult to concentrate on the tournament on the back of a public break-up. But days later, McIlroy went on to win the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth. His form continued and, in July, he won the British Open by a clear margin, before going on to win the U.S. PGA Championship. He later claimed that the break-up was the reason behind his unstoppable form, saying: 'I think what happened has been for the best in terms of my golf. 'I've put a bit more time into it and it has refocused me. I mean, what else do I have to do now?' According to sources, their wedding was due to take place at the Rockefeller Centre in New York on November 8. In a statement after their break-up, McIlroy said: 'The problem is mine. 'The wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realise that I wasn't ready for all that marriage entails. 'I wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we've had.' Ms Wozniacki, who was born in Denmark to Polish parents, became world number one in 2012.","Caroline Wozniacki, 24, lost Grand Slam title to Serena Williams .

"This is the 'invisible bomb' maker described by US officials as 'an evil genius' who could be a key player in looming air terror threats to the UK and America.

'Invisible bomb maker': Chemistry student Ibrahim Al-Asiri, (pictured) from . Saudi Arabia, created devices that can be sewn inside the human body - . and are virtually undetectable at airport security . Alert: Families face a summer of travel chaos following a security alert over bombs that cannot be detected by airport scanners - and could face secondary checks at departure gates . Families face a summer of travel chaos following a security alert over bombs that cannot be detected by airport scanners. Intelligence sources fear Al Qaeda is plotting to smuggle the devices on to planes travelling between  Britain and America. The explosives, which have no metal parts, could be hidden in clothes or surgically implanted inside a suicide bomber. The technology is already thought to have reached British jihadists fighting in Syria and Iraq. It is feared they will return to target flights leaving the UK. The alert led to the number of sophisticated body scanners at British airports being raised from ten to 21 yesterday. At Manchester, extra machines were sent to departure gates on transatlantic flights to allow staff to swab hand luggage at boarding as well as at security. Electronic devices and footwear are being subjected to greater scrutiny. The measures are likely to lead to delays during the summer holidays when Heathrow alone has 200,000 passengers a day. David Cameron insisted yesterday that safety comes first. ‘This is something we’ve discussed with the Americans and what we have done is put in place some extra precautions and extra checks,’ said the Prime Minister. ‘The safety of the travelling public must come first. We must not take any risks with that. I hope this won’t lead to unnecessary delays but it’s very important that we always put safety first, and we do.’ Airports last night insisted planes would not be delayed – but passengers may have to arrive at gates earlier to go through the new procedures. It has also been suggested that ‘sky marshals’ – undercover armed police – could be brought in on some routes. US security blogger Lisa Simeone said security staff at Heathrow were carrying out ‘vigorous’ physical searches, as well as extra tests for explosives, similar to those in America. ‘There was also a lot of swabbing going on, people’s belongings, their clothes and shoes, they even swabbed a baby’s pushchair,’ she said. ‘People were being checked for iPhones and things like that, but the biggest difference was in the physical checking of people’s bodies.’ Delayed: The new measures are likely to lead to longer queues, delays and increased checks at airports, as well as an influx of sky marshals on some transatlantic routes . Eryk . Salvaggio, a student, said: ‘The security guys were paying a lot of . attention to everyone’s bags and items as they went through the . scanners. It seemed to take twice as long for each bag to go through, . I’ve never seen it done like that and I have travelled a lot. ‘There were a lot of bags being taken aside too, when they came out the other side, for extra searches.’ A US Department of Homeland Security official would only say the measures were a response to a ‘real time, credible’ threat. For . the past five years jihadists in Yemen have been working on . ‘artfully-concealed devices’ – explosives that contain no metal and emit . only a faint vapour and can be disguised inside items such as shoes, . soft drink bottles and clothing. Intelligence points to bombmakers from . the group Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and tutored by Al-Asiri. The . official UK threat status remains unchanged at ‘substantial’, the third . grade in a five-level rating. A Department for Transport spokesman . said: ‘We have taken the decision to step up some of our aviation . security measures. For obvious reasons, we will not be commenting in . detail on those changes. ‘The majority of passengers should not experience significant disruption.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg cautioned that the new checks were unlikely to be ‘a one-off, temporary thing’. ‘This is the world we now live in,’ he said. ‘I don’t want people to think that this is some sort of blip for a week. 'This is part of an evolving and constant review about whether the checks in our airports – and indeed other places of entry and exits from countries – keep up with what we know from intelligence and other sources about the nature of the threats we face.’ The tightening of security came as a message was posted on a Twitter page purporting to be that of a British jihadi in Iraq, saying the UK was ‘afraid’ he might come back with skills he had learned fighting with terror group ISIS. The message was posted yesterday on an account believed to belong to Nasser Muthana, from Cardiff, who appeared in an ISIS propaganda video last week. He tweeted alongside a picture of makeshift bombs.","Intelligence sources fear Al Qaeda planning to smuggle devices on planes .

"Sierra Leone cyclist Mohamed Tholley has reportedly gone missing, days after his teammate was tested for Ebola . An athlete from Sierra Leone's Commonwealth Games team is reported to have gone missing - just days after his teammate was tested for the Ebola virus. The team's mountain biking champion Mohamed Tholley was due to compete in the time trial event in Glasgow yesterday but allegedly failed to turn up. According to a report in the Telegraph newspaper, Unisa Deen Kargbo, chef de mission of the Sierra Leone team, said Mr Tholley may have gone missing to avoid having to fly home and face the disease. He said: 'Unfortunately one of our athletes has not turned up for his event and we do not know where he is. It is possible he is not coming back. 'The situation is very serious at home, and it is possible this is why he does not want to return. It is very bad there.' But Jackie Brock-Doyle, a spokeswoman for Glasgow 2014, denied the claims at a press briefing this morning. She said: 'We have not had a single report of any athlete that has gone missing. 'If someone didn't turn up and they had gone missing, they would have reported it to us. 'If athletes have gone missing and their chef de missions are concerned they will talk to us and let us know.' It comes after a fellow Sierra Leone athlete at the Games revealed he was hospitalised and put into isolation for four days while he was tested for the deadly Ebola virus. Cyclist Moses Sesay, from Sierra Leone in West Africa where hundreds are reported to have died from the flesh-eating virus, was admitted to hospital in Glasgow after feeling unwell and developing fever-like symptoms. However, he was later given the all-clear and yesterday competed in the road race time trial. Last night, the 32-year-old said he and other athletes were scared of returning home because of Ebola and would try to remain in Britain until their special three-month visas for the Games expired. Mr Sesay, who comes from the Rotifunk Moyamba area of Sierra Leone which has been hit by the disease, said: ‘I was sick, I felt tired and listless.  All the doctors were in special suits to treat me – they dressed like I had Ebola.  I was very scared.’ Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he continued: ‘I was admitted for four days and they tested me for Ebola. 'It came back negative but they did it again and this time sent it to London where it was also negative.’ In action: Moses Sesay is pictured during the road race time trial at the Commonwealth Games . After this year's London marathon, a runner from Sierra Leone, 24-year-old Mami Konneh Lahun, went missing after finishing the race in 20th place. She failed to turn up at an airport when she was due to fly home, but police later found her safe and well. MailOnline tried to contact several representatives of the Sierra Leone team but none were available for comment. Mr Sesay, a father of one, who competed in the Games on his 32nd birthday, finished last in his race. He had arrived in Glasgow among a team of two dozen competitors and officials the week before the Games and felt unwell last Thursday, the day after he attended the Opening Ceremony. ‘All of us are scared about going back,' he said. 'We have a three-month visa in our passports and if I have the opportunity, I will stay here until it ends. ‘It is scary over there. My mother is a medical nurse so she may have to treat people.  My wife is also doing work in the medical field.’ A West African official last night also denied . that another member of the team had gone missing or that others had been . hospitalised. Scroll down for video . Deadly: Medics carry a young girl who has been in contact with people infected with Ebola in Sierra Leone . He said that officials in Glasgow were in contact with the High Commission in London over the timing of the team’s return and that they still planned to take part in the Closing Ceremony on Sunday. No special precautions had been taken inside the athlete’s village and they were sharing facilities with other teams, he added. It is the second Commonwealth Games that Mr Sesay, who trains in South Africa, has attended having competed in Delhi, India, four years ago. Officials stressed there had been no positive tests for Ebola in Scotland but refused to comment on negative tests. Ebola is a severe, often fatal illness, that affects humans as . well as primates, including monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees. The virus is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals . Once a person becomes infected, the disease can spread through contact with a sufferer's blood, urine, saliva, stools and semen. The Ebola virus is fatal in 90 per cent of cases and there is no vaccine and no known cure. What is Ebola virus disease? Ebola is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90 per cent.The illness affects humans as well as primates, including monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees. How do people become infected with the virus? Ebola is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. In Africa infection in humans has happened as a result of contact with chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead in the rainforest. Once a person becomes infected, the virus can spread through contact with a sufferer's blood, urine, saliva, stools and semen. Disease: Sesay is from Sierra Leone in West Africa where hundreds are reported to have died from the flesh-eating virus. Above, a microscopic image of the Ebola virus, created by CDC microbiologist Frederick Murphy . A person can also become infected if broken skin comes into contact with a victim's soiled clothing, bed linen or used needles. Men who have recovered from the disease, can still spread the virus to their partner through their semen for seven weeks after recovery. The Ebola virus is fatal in 90 per cent of cases and there is no vaccine and no known cure. Who is most at risk? Those at risk during an outbreak include: . What are the typical signs and symptoms? Sudden onset of fever, intense weakness,  muscle pain, headache and sore throat. That is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function and internal and external bleeding. The incubation period is between two and 21 days. A person will become contagious once they start to show symptoms. When should you seek medical care? If a person is in an area affected by the outbreak, or has been in contact with a person known or suspected to have Ebola, they should seek medical help immediately. What is the treatment? Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. They need intravenous fluids to rehydrate them. But there is currently no specific treatment for the disease. Some patients will recover with the appropriate care. Can Ebola be prevented? Currently there is no licensed vaccine for Ebola. Several are being tested but are not available for clinical use. Is it safe to travel to affected areas? The World Health Organisation reviews the public health situation regularly, and recommends travel or trade restrictions if necessary. The risk of infection for travellers is very low since person-to-person transmission results from direct contact with bodily fluids of victims.

"As the clock winds down to Dec. 21, experts on the Maya calendar have been racing to convince people that the Maya didn't predict an apocalypse for the end of this year. Some experts are now saying the Maya may indeed have made prophecies, just not about the end of the world. Archaeologists, anthropologists and other experts met Friday in the southern Mexico city of Merida to discuss the implications of the Maya Long Count calendar, which is made up of 394-year periods called baktuns. Expectations: With the Aztec Mayan calendar, pictured, ending on or around December 21 some fear it means the people believed it to be the end of the world . Experts estimate the system starts counting at 3114 B.C., and will have run through 13 baktuns, or 5,125 years, around Dec. 21. Experts say 13 was a significant number for the Maya, and the end of that cycle would be a milestone — but not an end. Fears that the calendar does point to the end have circulated in recent years. People in that camp believe the Maya may have been privy to impending astronomical disasters that would coincide with 2012, ranging from explosive storms on the surface of the sun that could knock out power grids to a galactic alignment that could trigger a reversal in Earth's magnetic field. Mexican government archaeologist Alfredo Barrera said on Friday that the Maya tried to make predictions, but perhaps about more humdrum events like droughts or disease outbreaks. Culture's remains: The Mayan temple at Xunantunich, Belize is seen where the people's culture of writing, astronomy and temple complexes flourished from years 300 to 900 . 'The Mayas did make prophecies, but not in a fatalistic sense, but rather about events that, in their cyclical conception of history, could be repeated in the future,' said Barrera, of the National Institute of Anthropology and History. Big plans: Arguing Mayan prophecies beyond 2012, king of Palenque, K'inich Hanaab Pakal, pictured, said he would return to Earth a couple thousands years from now in the future . Experts stressed that the ancient Maya, whose 'classic' culture of writing, astronomy and temple complexes flourished from the year 300 to 900, were extremely interested in future events, far beyond Dec. 21. 'There are many ancient Maya monuments that discuss events far into the future from now,' wrote Geoffrey Braswell, an anthropologist at the University of California at San Diego. 'The ancient Maya clearly believed things would happen far into the future from now.' 'The king of Palenque, K'inich Hanaab Pakal, believed he would return to the Earth a couple of thousand years from now in the future,' Braswell wrote in an email to The Associated Press. 'Moreover, other monuments discuss events even before the creation in 3114 B.C.' Only a couple of references to the 2012 date equivalency have been found carved in stone at Maya sites, and neither refers to an apocalypse, experts say. Such apocalyptic visions have been common for more than 1,000 years in Western, Christian thinking, and are not native to Maya thought. 'This is thinking that, in truth, has nothing to do with Mayan culture,' said Alexander Voss, an anthropologist at the University Of Quintana Roo, a state on Mexico's Caribbean coast. 'This thing about looking for end-times is not something that comes from Mayan culture.' Braswell compared the Maya calendar, with its system of cycles within cycles, to the series of synchronized wheels contained in old, analogue car odometers. 'The Maya long count system is like a car odometer,' Braswell wrote. 'My first car (odometer) only had six wheels so it went up to 99,999.9 miles. That didn't mean the car would explode after reaching 100,000 miles.'","Experts say Maya made prophecies but none about the end of the world .

Kathryn Cox, pictured, and her fellow hostage were rescued close to the lawless Colombian border after a farmer heard their cries for help . Ecuadorean defence minister Miguel Carvajal said: 'They released them because . of military and police pressure. 'Around 260 men from the armed forces, . 150 police officers, three helicopters were involved.' The women were said to be in ‘good condition’ last night despite their terrifying ordeal.

The pair had booked the four to five-day expedition with a local tour . company after arriving in the Tarapoa region of Sucumbios province, in . the north-east of Ecuador. The kidnappers – whom locals say have links to a notorious Colombian . drug-running gang – robbed the tourists of their cameras and phones . before taking Miss Cox, from Limpsfield in Surrey, and Australian Miss . Wilde, 32, at gunpoint and escaping into the forest. The women were . abandoned later that evening after their kidnappers realised they were . being tracked. The traumatised pair were then forced to spend the night alone before their cries for help were heard by a passing farmer. A source said that the women were also being tracked by the military . after one kidnapper used a mobile phone, allowing his whereabouts to be . traced.

"A tiny, remote-controlled camera has been lowered into an early Mayan tomb that has been sealed for 1,500 years. Extraordinary footage of the tomb at the Palenque archaeological site in southern Mexico revealed an apparently intact funeral chamber with red frescoes, pottery and pieces of a funerary shroud made of jade and mother of pearl. It also showed a series of nine figures depicted in black on a vivid, blood-red background. Archaeologists say the images from one of the earliest ruler's tombs found at Palenque will shed new light on the early years of the once-great city state. Unseen for 1,500 years: Scientists lowered a tiny camera into the Mayan tomb at the archaeological site in Palenque, southern Mexico. Amazingly, red paint still remains on the walls . Intact: The footage revealed a funeral chamber with red frescoes, pottery and pieces of a shroud made of jade and mother of pearl . Palenque was a Maya city state in what is now the Mexican state of Chiapas . The National Institute of . Anthropology and History said archaeologists have known about the tomb . since 1999, but have been unable to enter it because the pyramid . standing above it is unstable and breaking into the chamber could damage . the murals. It said . the floor appears to be covered with detritus and it is not immediately . evident in the footage if the tomb contains recognisable remains. But archaeologist Martha Cuevas said the jade and shell fragments seen on the video are 'part of a funerary costume'. The . chamber was found in a heavily-deteriorated pyramid complex known as . the Southern Acropolis, in a jungle-covered area of Palenque not far . from the Temple of Inscriptions, where the tomb of a later ruler, Pakal, . was found in the 1950s. While . Pakal's tomb featured a famous and heavily carved sarcophagus, no such . structure is seen in the footage of the tomb released yesterday. The . institute said in a statement that 'it is very probable that the . fragmented bones are lying directly on the stones of the floor'. But Dr Cuevas said the discovery shed . new light on early rulers, and its proximity to other burial sites . suggested the tomb may be part of a funerary complex. 'All this leads us to consider that the Southern Acropolis was used as a royal necropolis during that period,' she said. The floor of the tomb appears to be covered with detritus. It was not immediately evident in the footage if the tomb contains recognisable remains . The chamber was found in a heavily-deteriorated pyramid complex known as the Southern Acropolis, within Palenque . Susan Gillespie, an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Florida who was not involved in the project, said 'this is an important find for Palenque and for understanding Early Classic Maya history and politics'. This was in part, she explained, because the later rulers who made the city-state larger tended to build atop their predecessors' temples and tombs, making it hard to get at them. 'Palenque was a relatively important western Maya capital in the Early Classic, but with the build-up during the time of Pakal and some of his successors, those accomplishments were buried and thus difficult to assess, buried literally by Late Classic structures atop Early Classic ones,' Gillespie said. The later rulers wrote almost obsessively about Palenque's history in long stone inscriptions, but Gillespie noted that 'finding archaeological confirmation of the earlier kings has been extremely difficult'. The tomb's floor occupies about five square metres with a low, Mayan-arch roof of overlapping stones. Experts say it probably dates to between 431 and 550 AD, and could contain the remains of K'uk' Bahlam I, the first ruler of the city-state. The entrance to the tomb. Inside, its floor occupies about five square metres with a low, Mayan-arch roof of overlapping stones . Archaeologists have known about the tomb of a Mayan ruler at Palenque since 1999, but have only just developed the technology to be able to explore it . The tomb's existence was revealed by a shaft found near the top of the ruined pyramid, leading downward. But it was too narrow to provide any kind of view of the chamber. In late April, researchers lowered the tiny 2in-long camera into the tomb using the 6in-wide shaft. While the general public had not seen images of the interior of the tomb, video of it was made after the chamber was detected in 1999, noted David Stuart, a specialist in Mayan epigraphy at the University of Texas at Austin. The images had circulated among researchers and been posted on the internet, and Dr Stuart said that some evidence suggests the tomb ""is the burial of a noted female ruler of Palenque named Ix Yohl Ik'nal, based on the date and on the identities of ancestral figures painted on the walls.' 'The female ruler is mentioned in a number of the historical texts of the site,' he wrote. It would not be the first tomb of a female noble found at Palenque - in 1994, archaeologists found the tomb of a woman dubbed The Red Queen because of the red pigment covering her tomb. But it has never been established that she was a ruler of Palenque, and her tomb dates from a later period, between 600 and 700 AD.

"The federal government wasted millions of dollars in building a housing project for Border Patrol agents in Arizona near the Mexican border, spending nearly $700,000 per house in a small town where the average home costs less than $90,000, a watchdog report found. The analysis by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general found that U.S. Customs and Border Protection overspent by about $4.6 million on new houses and mobile homes in the small town of Ajo southwest of Phoenix. The agency has spent about $17 million for land, 21 two- and three-bedroom houses and 20 mobile homes. Construction was completed in December 2012. A watchdog report found that the government overspent by millions, paying nearly $700,000 per house in Ajo when the average home cost there is less than $90,000 . Building in Ajo became a priority because of its proximity to two Border Patrol stations and because nearby towns lacked sufficient public services for agents and their families . Customs and Border Protection paid about $680,000 per house and about $118,000 per mobile home, according to the report. The average home cost in Ajo is $86,500. The agency realized there was a need for more housing around 2008, when the Border Patrol doubled in size. There are currently about 21,000 border agents, roughly 5,000 of whom are in Arizona. In fiscal year 2004, there were about 10,800 agents, with about 2,400 in Arizona. Building in Ajo became a priority because of its proximity to two Border Patrol stations and because nearby towns lacked sufficient public services for agents and their families. 'CBP did not effectively plan and manage employee housing in Ajo, Arizona, and made decisions that resulted in additional costs to the federal government,' the report states. A statement from Customs and Border Protection says that while the agency agrees with recommendations made in the report, it disputes the way the inspector general calculated the cost of each house and mobile home, calling the method 'comparing apples to oranges.' 'CBP relies on the private housing market to provide housing for its employees, except in a few extreme locations such as Ajo,' the agency said in a statement released by spokesman Jim Burns. There are currently about 21,000 border agents, roughly 5,000 of whom are in Arizona. In fiscal year 2004, there were about 10,800 agents, with about 2,400 in Arizona . 'In Ajo, CBP built urgently needed housing for employees in accordance with the approved CBP design standards and the U.S. government guidance to be used by executive agencies concerning construction of federally owned housing for civilians.' He added the agency remains committed to providing quality, cost-effective housing to frontline border security personnel and their families. The report says Customs and Border Protection did not 'adequately justify' hiring the U.S. General Services Administration, a government agency, to manage the project, and that it overpaid the agency by about $3 million in unspent funds. CBP also increased funding for the project seven times without providing reasons for the increases or explaining how the money was spent. The government plans to build more houses in Lukeville, which is near Ajo.","Department of Homeland Security found U.S. Customs and Border Protection wasted millions spending $700,000 per home in an area where average costs are $90,000 .

"Scarlett Johansson has resigned as an ambassador for humanitarian group Oxfam in a row over her support for an Israeli company. The 29-year-old actress is promoting Soda Stream and is set to appear in an advert for the company during the Super Bowl. But left-leaning critics and Oxfam oppose the company because it has a large factory in an Israeli settlement . in the West Bank - a territory captured by Israel in 1967 and claimed by . the Palestinians. Oxfam opposes all trade from Israeli settlements because . they say it is illegal and denies Palestinian rights. In response to criticism, Johansson yesterday severed ties with Oxfam after eight years saying she supports trade and 'social interaction between a democratic Israel and Palestine'.  The charity had earlier said her Soda Stream deal was 'incompatible' with her role as an ambassador. The controversy has come at a delicate time for U.S.-backed peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. Israeli officials fear that if the talks fail, a nascent call for an economic boycott of Israel and its settlements might grow. Scroll down for video . Controversial endorsement: Scarlett Johansson, shown in an upcoming ad for SodaStream, announced on Wednesday she was ending her relationship with Oxfam International . Factory in the West Bank: Critics including Oxfam oppose all trade with Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. Soda stream operates a factory, pictured, that employs both Israelis and Palestinians in the settlement of Maale Adumin, pictured . A statement released by Johansson's . spokesman yesterday said the 29-year-old actress has 'a fundamental . difference of opinion' with Oxfam. 'Scarlett Johansson has respectfully decided to end her ambassador role with Oxfam after eight years,' the statement said. 'She and Oxfam have a fundamental difference of opinion in regards to the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement. She is very proud of her accomplishments and fundraising efforts during her tenure with Oxfam.' Changing boundaries: Israel took control of the West Bank where the Soda stream in located after the Six Day War of 1967 . Maale Adumin is located four miles from Jerusalem in the West Bank. It was established as an Israeli settlement in 1975 and is now home to 39,200 people . Six Day War: Israeli troops in action during the 1967 conflict which saw Tel Aviv take control of Gaza and the West Bank. The IDF has since withdrawn from much of the territory under a series of peace deals but many Israeli settlements remain . The political divisions fueling the controversy over Scarlett Johansson's Soda Stream deal date back decades to the creation of Israel in 1947 and its decades of conflict with neigbouring Arab countries. Critics say Soda Stream should not operate a plant in an Israeli settlement on the West Bank - which was occupied by Israeli forces in the aftermath of the Six Day War in 1967. Before that, the area was part of Palestine. Palestinians say the land is rightfully theirs and international law has declared Israeli occupation of area technically illegal for decades. In 1967, Israel launched an attack on Egypt and then also went to war with Jordan and Syria believing its very survival was at stake. The attack had followed months of military build up and rhetoric from Jordan, Syria, and Egypt and generals in Tel Aviv believed striking first was essential to their country's survival. After a surprise air attack on Egypt that wiped out that country's air force, The Israeli Defence Force routed the combined forces of Jordan, Egypt and Syria. In the aftermath,Israeli took control of the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan heights. Tens of thousands of Palestinians fled and Israel established de-facto control over all of the area that was originally Palestine. Israeli leaders insist that they had to have control over the area to ensure the survival of the their state. In the decades since, Israel has since built scores of settlements on the occupied territories which have been condemned by the international community including the United States and Britain. Israel has since withdrawn from most of the West Bank under a series of peace deals, but many settlements including Maale Adumin, where the Soda Stream plant is, remain. The plant employs both Israelis and Palestinians. But activists including Oxfam say that trade with Israeli companies which operates in settlements legitamize the technically illegal towns and contribute to the continued poverty and denial of rights to Palestinians. However, the Soda Stream plant employs both Palestinians and Israelis and the company says it is a model of peaceful cooperation. Both settlers and Palestinians receive equal wages and at the plant, which makes the Palestinians who work there far higher paid than average. In return, activists say Palestinians have few other employment options and are being taken advantage of. Settlement: An aerial view of the Maale Adumimum settlement in the West Bank where the Soda Stream is located . Unequal rights? Critics including Oxfam say that companies should not trade with companies that operate in Israeli settlements because it deprives Palestinian of their rights . Representatives of SodaStream, which is listed on Nasdaq in New York, say the Israeli and Palestinian workers at the plant Maale Adumim in receive equal wages and benefits that far exceed those offered in Palestinian-run areas. However campaigners say they have testimony from Palestinian workers who say they are treated like 'slaves' and are fired if they become ill. Earlier this month, Johansson signed on as the first global brand ambassador of SodaStream International Ltd., and she's set to appear in an ad for the at-home soda maker during the Super Bowl on Sunday. In response to the criticism, . Johansson said last week she was a 'supporter of economic cooperation . and social interaction between a democratic Israel and Palestine.' Oxfam . took issue with Johansson, noting it was 'considering the implications . of her new statement and what it means for Ms. Johansson's role as an . Oxfam global ambassador.' Support . for complete boycotts of Israel goods is composed mostly of . pro-Palestinian intellectuals and bloggers, advocates for a blanket . boycott of all Israeli goods and questions the state's legitimacy. Doing her bit: Scarlett on an Oxfam trip to Uttar Pradesh, India in 2007 . But there is a different consensus among international rights groups like Oxfam, however, which discourages trade only with Israeli firms located on land in the occupied West Bank. 'The very existence of (Israeli settlements) amounts to a serious violation of international law,"" the New York-based Human Rights Watch said in a statement on Wednesday. 'It is impossible to ignore the Israeli system of unlawful discrimination, land confiscation, natural resource theft, and forced displacement of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, where SodaStream is located,' the rights group added. There are increasing fears in Israel that such calls for a boycott of its goods are growing. Israeli Finance Minister Yair Lapid warned this week that his country risks the 'reality of a European boycott, even a very partial one,[and] Israel's economy will retreat backward and every Israeli citizen will feel it straight in the pocket.' Super commercial: Scarlett will be featured in a SodaStream commercial airing during the Super Bowl game on Sunday . Johansson had served as a global ambassador for Oxfam since 2007, raising funds and promoting awareness about global poverty. In her role as an Oxfam ambassador, she traveled to India, Sri Lanka and Kenya to highlight the impact of traumatic disasters and chronic poverty. A spokesman for Oxfam said: 'Oxfam has accepted Scarlett Johansson’s decision to step down after eight years as a Global Ambassador and we are grateful for her many contributions. 'While Oxfam respects the independence of our ambassadors, Ms Johansson’s role promoting the company SodaStream is incompatible with her role as an Oxfam Global Ambassador. 'Oxfam believes that businesses, such as SodaStream, that operate in settlements further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the Palestinian communities that we work to support. Oxfam is opposed to all trade from Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law. 'Ms Johansson has worked with Oxfam since 2005 and in 2007 became a Global Ambassador, helping to highlight the impact of natural disasters and raise funds to save lives and fight poverty.' SodaStream had to make revisions to its Super Bowl ad after it was initially banned for making references to Coke and Pepsi, which are sponsors of the American football championship game. But in an In an interview on Wednesday, SodaStream's chief executive, Dan Birnbaum, shrugged off the boycott campaign. 'To the best of my knowledge, we have not lost a single customer,"" he said. ""If anything, it advances our awareness around the world, because people are talking about SodaStream.'","The 29-year-old actress resigned after eight years with Oxfam .

"Your day starts at dawn with a cold bath followed by a 90-minute workout in your own gym. Afterwards, you're allowed a low-calorie drink before two hours with your personal hairdresser. Then, in skin-tight sportswear, you spend the daytime hours exercising. Your evenings are a whirl of parties at which you're always the centre of attention, your hair glittering with diamond stars. 19th century beauty tips: Daisy tried a goats' milk bath and veal facial . Finally, at 2am you crawl into bed, but not before you've covered your face in... raw veal. It sounds like the insane beauty regime of a Hollywood star. In fact, the year is 1875 and this is the beauty routine of Elisabeth, Empress of Austria, who at 38 was dubbed the 'loveliest woman in Europe.' I became fascinated with Elisabeth, known as Sisi, when I visited Vienna and saw the gym she had built in her bedroom at the Hofburg Palace. Her preoccupation with her appearance was so fascinating it became a major theme in my new book The Fortune Hunter. It is a fictionalised account of the beauty's scandalous affair with a dashing army captain ten years her junior and shows how the pressure to look perfect was just as acute then as it is today. Sisi, who was appalled by the stoutness of other European royals of her time like Queen Victoria, was a fitness fanatic and performed 20 pull-ups every morning on gymnastic rings. Afterwards, she'd be laced into corsets to achieve a 19in waist, and spent her days riding to hounds or hiking. But it's her beauty regime that makes the mind boggle. As well as her veal face-mask, Sisi bathed in goats' milk, reduced stomach bloating by drinking five salted egg whites, and washed her admired locks in eggs and cognac. Day in the life: Writer Daisy, left, followed the Empress's beauty regime as she was once dubbed the 'loveliest woman in Europe' She is even said to have slept with her hands tied above her head so the blood drained away, leaving her hands smooth and white. Bizarre as it sounds, there is no doubt her beauty regime worked. When she died, aged 60 in 1898, stabbed to the heart by an Italian anarchist, she still had that tiny waist, despite having four children. Photographs of her - in her 40s and 50s - show she was still astonishingly beautiful. Her marriage to the Emperor was not happy, but she remained irresistible to men of all ages. The more I wrote about Sisi, the more I wondered how her beauty regime would work for a modern middle-aged mother of two. There was only one way to find out... After the 5am bath of cold water, Sisi would have a brisk massage to get her circulation going and her complexion glowing. Getting up this early was grim - my days usually start at 7am with three cups of tea and a hot shower. But the early start was nothing compared to the ice-cold bath. My shrieks on hitting the water might have woken up the house but my skin glowed, my eye bags shrank and I felt alive. I couldn't find a masseuse willing to take me on at 5.30 am but gave myself an extremely vigorous rub down with a towel instead. Fitness fanatic: Sisi worked out to stay slim then was laced into corsets to achieve a 19in waist . I don't have gymnastic rings at home so I went to a local gym to follow Sisi's regime of pull-ups and dumbbell exercises with my personal trainer. Although I cycle everywhere and exercise twice a week, it was a struggle. I could do the leg stretches and dumbbell lifts - just - but I could manage just one pull-up, and that was only to chin level, before collapsing. Sisi's upper-body strength was clearly phenomenal. Perhaps riding horses might be easier. I learnt as a child, so I went for a ride in Hyde Park. After an hour-and-a-half of trotting and cantering I was feeling muscles in places I didn't even know I had. Judging by my aches the next day, Sisi's inner thighs must have been made of iron. There's no way I could have spent all day galloping to hounds like she did. As it was, when my riding session finished I felt like I had been in a spin dryer. And apart from a few gulps of beef tea after her morning exercise, Sisi consumed nothing else during the day apart from a dry biscuit or two (I improvised with an Oxo cube and Ryvita). Crowning glory: She bathed her hair in eggs and cognac to keep it lustrous . Thick, glossy locks then, as now, were hugely prized. We think the Duchess of Cambridge's mane as a crowning glory, but Sisi's was far more impressive. Her hairdresser, Baroness Feifalik, toiled for two hours each morning to turn her ankle-length chestnut tresses into a crown of plaits. Washing her locks took a whole day, once a fortnight. The baroness used a mix of a dozen eggs and a bottle of cognac to keep her mistress's locks lustrous; the eggs for moisture and body, the cognac for shine. I tried washing my hair with Sisi's unorthodox shampoo. I used two eggs whisked with an inch of brandy and left it in my hair for ten minutes. It smelt delicious - like eggnog - but even after I rinsed it out, my hair felt sticky and the aroma of Christmas followed me around. My husband kept asking: 'Have you been drinking? This one was intended to revive Sisi after a day in the saddle. To keep the skin on her body soft, the Empress bathed in goats' milk, and she used to travel with a herd of goats to this end. Or if she had had a hard day’s hunting she would bathe in hot olive oil to soothe her aching muscles. Finding enough goats' milk to fill my bath was quite a challenge, as, unlike Sisi, I don't have my own personal flock. It took runs to several supermarkets to get enough to cover my all-too-ample flesh - I used about ten gallons topped up with hot water. While I wouldn't do this on a regular basis (it cost about £25), the skin on my legs and arms has never been softer. This is probably because the enzymes in the goats' milk tenderise the dry skin. I certainly didn't need any body lotion afterwards and my impressed husband said my legs looked and felt super smooth. Cleaning the greasy, tangy bath afterwards was hell (not a problem that an empress has to think about). I didn’t bother with the olive oil as by my calculation to fill my bath would have cost me nearly £800! Sisi would sleep with warm, damp cloths knotted round her waist because this was thought to shrink it. I heated damp towels in the microwave to do the same, then wrapped myself in silver foil to keep the heat in and to stop my bed from getting soaking wet. It wasn't particularly comfortable and I don't think my waist shrank overnight, but perhaps it needs to be done regularly. When she felt bloated, Sisi would drink five egg whites mixed with salt. I think it was meant to clear out her digestive system. Just before going to sleep, I drank the concoction - the single most disgusting thing that has ever passed my lips. I had to have a slug of the hair-washing brandy to keep me from throwing up. My stomach did look a bit flatter afterwards, but that may have been because the mixture put me off proper food for days. Daisy has written a novel based on Sisi's life . Sisi was extremely concerned about the texture of her skin as she spent most of her days hunting. This meaty face pack was thought to repair the ravages of too much exposure to the sun, wind and rain. Over the veal, she wore a leather mask so she could sleep with it on (presumably to keep her three wolf hounds from nibbling at it). When I asked my butcher for really thin slices of the meat he asked me what I was using it for. I think he is still laughing at my answer, especially as the humanely-reared veal escalopes cost about £20 for the lot. The veal felt quite soothing on my skin (I kept mine in place with cling film instead of a leather mask) and it smelt no worse than some face creams. It wasn't even uncomfortable to sleep in, or perhaps that's because I was exhausted from all the exercise. And my skin did look soft and pink the next morning. How much of that was dried veal juices I really can't say, although my skin was definitely dewier. But my pillows were a bit worse for wear from the juice that escaped and my husband decided to sleep on the sofa. After a day and night of Sisi's beauty ritual I can quite understand why she looked so good - but also why her marriage was so unhappy. The Emperor can't have enjoyed living with a woman who spent her entire day making herself beautiful for other men but not for him. And who wants to sleep next to a woman wearing a Hannibal Lecter mask and smelling of goats' milk and dripping blood, even if her skin is really soft?

"Goalscorer Andros Townsend does not believe England should beat themselves up after only defeating minnows San Marino 5-0 on Thursday night.

"The White House suggested Friday that President Barack Obama was trying to work out his tensions when he played 18 holes of golf on Wednesday – complete with grins and fist-bumps – immediately after delivering a brief but moving speech condemning the gruesome execution of American photojournalist James Foley. And adding to the week of optics problems, Secretary of State John Kerry was spotted sailing off the island of Nantucket while the Pentagon and White House answered tough questions about the Middle East. 'Sports and leisure activities are a good way for release and clearing of the mind for a lot of us,' Deputy White House Press Secretary Eric Schultz told reporters in a makeshift briefing room on Martha's Vineyard, where Obama is on a two-week vacation. But 'I am not going to get into the president's mindset on that,' he added. The president drew fire this week after reacting for just five minutes to Foley's on-camera slaying by Islamist militants linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), and then gripping his driver for five hours. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Deputy White House Press Secretary Eric Schultz briefed reporters Friday on Martha's Vineyard and hinted that Barack Obama needed to decompress just a bit on the golf course . The fist-bump: Less than ten minutes after delivering heartfelt words about the vicious killing of James Foley, Obama hit the links with friends . Obama's golf pals on Wednesday included NBA legend Alonzo Mourning (left) Less than ten minutes before teeing off, he had told a global audience that 'when people harm Americans, anywhere, we do what’s necessary to see that justice is done.' Then he was seen laughing with friends at the Farm Neck Golf Club. A day later he played golf again, although photographs taken Thursday depicted a more somber commander-in-chief recreating. Obama took first lady Michelle Obama hiking on Friday morning. Reporters and photographers were kept far out of range. Schultz acknowledged Friday the poor 'optics' of playing golf while a decapitated journalist's family mourned, but insisted that 'the president is focused on doing his job,' even while on vacation. 'Just because the president is in a different location doesn't mean he's not doing his job,' Schultz insisted, assuring reporters that domestic and international events have 'absolutely captured the president's attention while we've been here.' Donald Trump, the ubiquitous real estate mogul and golf course owner, told MailOnline that the White House should be taking advantage of Obama's golf outings as a chance to build compromises with Republicans. Golf 'is a perfect game to make friends and negotiate deals over,' he said Friday. But 'the only people Obama should be playing golf with are congressmen – legislators – and especially the opposition.' 'Obama should not be playing golf on the first day of bombings or after an American journalist is beheaded.' A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told MailOnline that to his knowledge, the senior Republican lawmaker had never been invited to play a round with the president. Kerry hasn't been seen in Washington all week, and reporters have been unable to get an answer from the State Department about his location. But Instagram user Judy Durkin posted a photo of a sailboat on Monday that bears the same markings as Kerry's, cruising neat Nantucket – just a few miles from where Obama has been vacationing. Others tweeted Kerry sightings there as recently as Thursday. The Republican National Committee, predictably, was not amused. 'The Obama White House is MIA on the world stage,' RNC Deputy Press Secretary Raffi Williams told MailOnline. 'America’s influence around the world has been waning ever since Obama took office and now that the world is erupting in crises our top diplomat is sailing in Nantucket.' 'Americans want hands on leadership that tackles the tough problems head on. The out of touch leadership seen from Obama and Kerry is going to hurt 2014 Democrats.' The secretary of state's secret vacation plans are no longer a secret, thanks to Twitter . The Straight Wharf restaurant's website includes a menu with no prices, but it's not clear what kind of dinner $1,000 can buy there . The State Department hasn't said where John Kerry is this week, but an alert Massachusetts Instagram user spotted his sailboat cruising near Nantucket island . The State Department released a statement in Kerry's name on Wednesday, after the Foley video had made most of America cringe. 'We grieve for James Foley. We mourn for his family and his loved ones,' the statement read. 'We honor the courage and pray for the safety of all those who risk their lives to discover the truth where it is needed most.' 'And make no mistake: we will continue to confront ISI[S] wherever it tries to spread its despicable hatred. The world must know that the United States of America will never back down in the face of such evil.' Criticism of the president after he marked his scorecard Wednesday was fast and furious. 'Not only did he insult the Foley family; he sent a message to [ISIS leader] Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and all of the other jihadi terrorist militants – now soldiers of a jihadi army – that he doesn't take it all seriously.' Texas Republican Congressman Louie Gohmert told Mailonline that Obama's detached attitude suggests he hasn't been engaged in the hunt for Foley's murderer. 'Unfortunately for those who want evil ISIS members eliminated before they kill more Americans,' Gohmert said, 'the president spent more time lining up his many putts than he did lining up efforts to stop the killers.' Lou Barletta, a Republican lawmaker from Pennsylvania, told MailOnline that the image of Obama golfing his cares away 'is disheartening, and sends the wrong signals to our enemies. ISIS needs to be stopped, and fist pumps between the president and his buddies won’t stop them.' Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney told Fox News host Sean Hannity that 'every day we find new evidence that he’d rather be on the golf course than he would be dealing with a crisis that’s developing rapidly in the Middle East.' ABC News political director Rick Klein added that 'the president himself clearly doesn't ... care about the way it looks.' 'Jihad John' (right) took the life of American photojournalist James Foley by decapitating him with a small knife, in a video released by ISIS fanatics on Tuesday . Serious – for 5 minutes: A stern and resolved Obama spoke to the nation briefly on Wednesday about Foley's murder, before taking a short limo ride to the first tee . 19 hours and off he goes: UK Prime Minister David Cameron made a brief stop at No. 10 to talk about James Foley before heading back to Cornwall for body-surfing . Obama's golf game found a parallel in the UK on Friday, as Prime Minister David Cameron returned to his own beach vacation just 19 hours after returning to No. 10 Downing Street to be briefed on the ISIS execution and deliver some brief comments. Cameron was photographed body-boarding through waves in Cornwall in a three quarter-length wet suit. Foley's killer spoke with a British accent on a video that ISIS released on Tuesday. Some former captives of the group believed to have held Foley for two years have said a three-man cell of UK terrorists were known to them as 'The Beatles.' A furious effort is underway – but without Cameron in his office – to identify the executioner, known now as 'Jihad John.' Government sources have insisted that the prime minister remains in full touch with Whitehall during his holiday, with a secure phone line set up for his use. Labour MP Ann Clwyd, the former British human rights envoy to Iraq, said it was 'extraordinary that he has gone off on holiday again after a few hours back in London – it is just not good enough.' 'If he is serious about the threat to Britain, as he says he is and as he ought to be, then he should not be pushing off on holiday. He should be recalling MPs to Parliament so that we can discuss the situation and debate our response.'","Obama spokesman suggested the president needs to blow off steam with 8 rounds of golf on vacation .

"President Barack Obama rebuked Russian President Vladimir Putin today for not using his influence to stop Russian separatists in Ukraine from 'tampering' with evidence at the site of the MH17 crash. Speaking from South Lawn of the White House, the U.S. president said it's Putin's 'responsibility to compel' the rebels to cease removing bodies from the area and allow investigators to have 'immediate and full access' to the site so they can conduct a thorough investigation. 'That's the least that we can do. That's the least that decency demands,' he said. The separatists' behavior begs the question, 'what exactly are they trying to hide?' Obama asked at one point in his remarks. 'This is an insult to those who have lost loved ones.' Obama's solemn statement comes a day after Senators on the committees that oversee international affairs criticized him for inadequately responding to the ongoing violence in Ukraine. The president has also been pilloried for devoting just 40 seconds of a 16 minute transportation speech on the day of the Malaysia Airlines crash to the tragedy and for spending his evening attending Democratic Party fundraisers while his national security team handled the the U.S.'s response. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . This is an insult: President Barack Obama urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to compel Russian separatists to cease their efforts of hindering investigators at the site of last week's Malaysian Airlines disaster . Victims of the plane crash were gathered on Sunday and piled onto vehicles before being taken to a train station in rebel-held Torez, nine miles from the crash site . In remarks on Friday and this morning on the plane crash, Obama took a more serious approach to discussing the calamity and warned the Kremlin that there would be consequences if it continued to aid and abet the separatists. Responding to a statement from Putin yesterday in which he publicly threw his support behind an international investigation into the downing of the plane, Obama said the Russian leader's words 'have to be supported by actions.' 'Time is of the essence,' Obama said. 'Families deserve to be able to lay their loved ones to rest with dignity.' 'My preference continues to be finding a diplomatic resolution within Ukraine,' he noted. 'I believe that can still happen.' But if Russia keeps supporting the separatists, he said, it 'will only further isolate itself from the international community, and the costs for its behavior 'will only continue to increase.' Obama did not elaborate on what those costs would be, however. The immediate concern for world leaders, he said, is investigating the crash. The president said . he'd spoken to many world leaders throughout the last four days since Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down by BUK-M1 surface-to-air missiles, killing 298 people, and 'all of them . remain in a state of shock' as well as 'outrage.' 'We have to make sure that the truth is out and that accountability exists,' the U.S. president said. President Obama signed an executive order baring the federal government and its contracting agencies from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity this morning before giving remarks on the situation in Ukraine . Over the weekend images emerged of crash victims in body bags baking in the sun on the side of the road. The bodies were later tossed into dirty trucks and transported to a train station  where they were supposed to be loaded into a refrigerated car and shipped to a rebel-controlled town 50 miles away. The cooling system in the car was reportedly not working overnight, however, and the bodies have been allowed to rot. Yesterday U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry confirmed reports of 'drunken separatist soldiers unceremoniously piling bodies into trucks, removing both bodies, as well as evidence, from the site.' 'What's happening is really grotesque. And it is contrary to everything that President Putin and Russia said that they would do,' Kerry said. 'This is the kind of behavior that has no place in the community of nations,' Obama said today. Ranking Republican member on the Senate Foreign Relations committee Bob Corker called the situation 'incredibly tragic.' 'What is also tragic is the response that the . West has given up until this point,' Corker, a Republican, told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace. 'And in many ways, because of that . cautious response, Russia has continued to foment all the problems that . they've created in Eastern Ukraine.' Committee chairman Bob Menendez, a Democrat, also expressed discontent with Obama's handing of Putin since the Russian-backed separatists invaded Ukraine this spring. 'Clearly President Putin has created the set of circumstances and has . supplied the resources … to the rebels so that this tragedy could take . place,' Menendez told Wallace yesterday, according to The Hill. 'For me, I think the West, including the [United . States], has to have a far more significant response than we’ve seen to . date.' Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said during a Facebook Q and A this afternoon that she agrees with the president's statements this morning but indicated that she thinks the U.S. should be sending a stronger message to Putin. 'We should work to bring our European allies together with us on tougher sanctions that would make it clear to Putin that there is a price to pay for this kind of behavior and we should encourage Europeans to start immediately to make sure they are less dependent on Russian energy so they are not intimidated,' she said. 'Finally, I would like to see more support given to the Ukrainians to guard their borders and to protect themselves.' In a statement of his own, Putin accused his critics yesterday of politicizing the plane crash while simultaneously placing the blame on Ukraine for inciting the attack. 'Nobody should and has no right to use this tragedy to achieve their narrowly selfish political goals,' Putin said in a televised address. 'We repeatedly called upon all conflicting sides to stop the bloodshed immediately and sit down at the negotiating table. I can say with confidence that if military operations were not resumed on June 28 in eastern Ukraine, this tragedy wouldn’t have happened.' Today Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk pointed the finger back at Putin, claiming his country is aligned with the 'devil.' 'I do not expect anything from the Russian government. They supplied weapons, they sent in fighters. Putin should understand that it's enough already,' Yatseniuk said. 'This is not a conflict between Ukraine and Russia. It is an international conflict. 'Russia is on the dark side, on the side of the devil,' he claimed. British Prime Minister David Cameron today called the plane crash an 'appalling tragedy' and said he hoped Putin would 'use this moment to find a path out of . this festering and dangerous crisis by ending Russia's support for the . separatists.'","Putin needs to compel separatists to allow investigators to .

"Unsolved: A new person of interest behind the abduction and murder of 10-year-old Holly Piirainen has been uncovered . A man dead nearly a decade could be the key to the mysterious abduction and murder of a little Massachusetts girl that has stumped investigators for more than 18 years. Investigators named David Pouliot, a Vietnam veteran who worked for a juvenile detention center, as a 'person of interest' in the disappearance of 10-year-old Holly Piirainen, but stopped short of naming him as a suspect. Holly was abducted during a family vacation in Sturbridge, Massachusetts, on August 5, 1993, and her remains were discovered three months later eight miles away in Brimfield. Investigators found evidence near Holly's remains that 'indisputably' puts Pouliot at the wooded site where her body was dumped, Hampden County District Attorney Mark Mastroianni. Mr Mastroianni would not say what, specifically, was found or how it links Pouliot to the killing. However, . it was only when the evidence was subjected to 21st century forensic . science that the connection to Pouliot became apparent, he said at a . press conference this morning. No one has ever been charged with her murder, but analysis of forensic evidence found at the scene has revealed new leads. 'This is the lead we’ve all been waiting for,’ Holly's father Rick Piirainen told the Boston Globe. 'We feel it’s the beginning of the end of this case.' Pouliot died in 2003 at the age of 49 at his mother's home in Springfield. He . was a Vietnam War veteran, a member of the US Coast Guard and worked . for the Massachusetts Department of Youth Services at the juvenile . detention center in Westfield, according to his obituary at the time. Connected: David E. Pouliot, pictured both right and left, died in 2003. However, investigators linked him to the site where Holly's body was found through evidence they discovered nearby . Vanished: Holly Kristen Piirainen went missing August 5, 1993 while she was on vacation with her family in Sturbridge, Massachusetts . Authorities say he frequently hunted and fished in the woods where Holly was found. He . has a criminal record, Mr Mastroianni said, but no arrests that would . have indicated he might be capable of killing a little girl. This . is the first break in the case in 10 years, but Mr Mastroianni said . several times during his news conference that Pouloit is not a suspect, . merely a person of interest. David Procopio, a spokesman for the . Massachusetts State Police, told the Globe: 'We hope the new evidence . may spark someone's memory, or someone's conscience. 'Holly's family has waited for justice for almost two decades.' Holly disappeared after she and her 5-year-old brother Zachary walked down the road to a neighbor's house to look at a litter of newborn puppies. Holly, Zachary and her other little brother Andrew, 8, were visiting their grandmother's cottage with their father Rick. Loved dogs: Holly when to pet a new littler of puppies at a neighbor's house and never returned. Her remains were found months later by hunters . No answers: Holly's family has waited more than . 18 years to find out what happened to her. The district attorney says . investigators are closer to solving the case than they have ever been . Zachary returned from the neighbor's house without Holly. For weeks, authorities hunted for Holly and what clues to what might have happened to her. It was two and a half months later when hunters stumbled across her remains in a thickly wooded area. Over the years, police have questioned at least two men on suspicions they had something to do with her disappearance, but have never had a break in the case. Pouliot's name only came up recently after he was linked to the evidence found under a bride near Holly's body. Holding out hope: Holly's dad Rick (left) and her grandmother Maureen Lemieux (right) were at the press conference. Ms Lemieux said she is 'cautiously optimistic' about authorities resolving the case . Family: Brothers Andrew (right) and Zachary (left) Piirainen, who were just young boys when their older sister disappeared, attended the press conference today. Zachary was with his sister right before she disappeared . Maureen Lemieux, Holly's grandmother, . told the Worchester Telegram and Gazette that the family never knew . Poilio and had never heard of him until prosecutors brought his name . forward. She said the said the development has her family 'cautiously optimistic.' With the new evidence comes a new motivation for witnesses or anyone who might know about what happened to Holly. State Sen Stephen M. Brewer and state Rep Todd M. Smola, a Democrat and a Republican, are offering a $15,000 reward for any information that leads to solving the case. The two politicians pooled the money together using personal and campaign funds. Making his case: Hampden County District Attorney Mark Mastroianni said the new evidence was one of the biggest breakthroughs of the case . 'I took that abduction personally' Sen Brewer said. 'That and Molly Bish.' Investigators have speculated Holly's abduction and murder could be linked with that of Molly Bish, who disappeared on June 27, 2000, after she was dropped off at Comins Pond in Warren where she was a lifeguard. The 16-year-old's remains were found in 2003 in a wooded area near Comins Pond. However, the Telegram and Gazette reported that authorities have had their eye on a different suspect in that murder.","21st century techniques 'indisputably' link David Pouliot to the wooded area where Holly's remains were found .

"A spectacular animation compiled using images that are over 50-years-old is offering a glimpse into what Piccadilly Circus looked like decades ago. Using images from archives combined with old weather reports and pioneering colouring and animation software, London agency FullScream recreated what the famous London landmark would have looked like on a Spring weekday evening in May 1961. Panning across the Statue of Eros, users can see the neon Coca-Cola sign installed in 1954, and BP's billboard of 1961. Using images from archives combined with old weather reports and pioneering colouring and animation software, London agency FullScream created what the famous London landmark would have looked and felt like on a Spring weekday evening in May 1961 . Panning across the Statue of Eros, you can see the neon Coca-Cola sign installed in 1954, and BP's billboard of 1961 . This is what the famous landmark looks like today - fewer billboards and more LED signs . Users can see how the billboards used to stretch further into Shaftsbury Avenue, and how there were many smaller advertisements, rather than the few bright LCD screens we're used to seeing today. Martini, Dunlop and Scotch Ale are other brands who used to have billboards shown in the charming animation. FullScream opened in London in February and Ced Pakusevskij director said: 'At the end of our first week in London, we walked to Piccadilly Circus and sat there, enjoying its marvel. 'We wondered what it might have looked and felt like before all the big screens; when the billboards were made of mechanisms and neons. After some research and finding incredible archive photographs, we decided to re-create it.' Tom Church, Director of FullScream said: 'Imagine having gone to see such a film or play, and walking past the entrancing billboards of Piccadilly Circus. It must have been spectacular' Mr Church added: 'Strangely for such a famous landmark, there are very few large, original coloured pictures from the 1940s - 1960s. FullScream had to find a number of photographs and layer them on top of each other' The agency used other photographs to create movement, remastering many from black and white . The creative project has an air of West End romance and mystery. Tom Church, Director of FullScream said: '1961 was the year of West Side Story, La Dolce Vita and Breakfast at Tiffany's. 'The Palace Theatre on Shaftsbury Avenue had just started The Sound of Music. Imagine having gone to see such a film or play, and walking past the entrancing billboards of Piccadilly Circus. It must have been spectacular.' Mr Church added: 'Strangely for such a famous landmark, there are very few large, original coloured pictures from the 1940s - 1960s. FullScream had to find a number of photographs and layer them on top of each other. However, as each photograph was from a different year, the Piccadilly Circus billboards changed between the photos.' He explained to keep it consistent, the agency had to remove people, advertisements and some structures. Once FullScream had the photos they created styleboards imagining how the billboards would look and feel when lit up. Using professional creative design software including Adobe After Effects and 3D camera mapping programs, they were able to create camera movement through Piccadilly Circus and past the Statue of Eros. Their process of turning historical photographs into animated backdrops is the same as that used by Hollywood filmographers, such as in Moulin Rouge - it is more cost effective than creating computer generated imagery (CGI) from scratch or designing cityscapes.","Creative design agency in London created what Piccadilly Circus would have looked like in May 1961 .

"Google yesterday announced record British earnings of £3.6billion last year, an increase of £600million on 2012. But the online search giant has yet to disclose how much corporation tax it will pay. It will come under enormous pressure over the figure following fierce criticism over its tax affairs. For 2012, the US multinational paid just £11.6million of tax on an income of £3billion. Fresh storm: Google announced $3.4bn profit for the last quarter of 2013, but its expected tax bill is just £11.2m . It was accused of leaving hard-pressed families and businesses to fund public services such as hospitals and schools. Experts . say Google’s corporation tax bill for 2013 is likely to be much lower . than it should be because the group runs its British operations out of . Ireland. Pretty profits: Google CEO Larry Page called the results 'another great quarter of momentum' ‘On the basis of . Google’s global performance and the share of its profits in the UK we . would expect it to pay more than £200million a year in the UK,’ said tax . accountant Richard Murphy, who helped expose coffee chain Starbucks for . avoiding tax. ‘What we . know is that for the last year it reported, Google declared it paid . just £11million. So the question is on the table – where are the missing . millions?’ Margaret Hodge, . chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee urged the Government . to take action. ‘This again shows the scandal where profits are made . from economic activity and yet Google refuses to pay its fair share of . tax,’ she said. Jonathan . Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Ordinary . taxpayers are angry when big international companies take advantage of . the loopholes in our increasingly complicated tax system. ‘But . the fact is, it is the politicians themselves who are responsible for . this by creating a tax code which is hugely complicated and open to . being exploited. ‘The only solution to this is to create a simpler, fairer and more competitive tax system.’ Investment: Google Glass is one of the products that the company is pouring its profits into . Google . employs almost 2,000 people in the UK, the majority of whom negotiate . advertising sales deals. But it books the transactions in Ireland, . allowing it to minimise the tax it pays here. A . company spokesman said yesterday: ‘Like most multinationals we pay the . bulk of our £1.2billion corporate tax bill where our business . originated, in our case the US. That’s a rate of more than 19 per cent, . roughly what a UK-based company would pay. ‘We’re . also a significant contributor to the UK economy, having created over . 2,000 jobs. In 2013 alone we invested more than £300million in property, . and tax related to our UK operations totalled more than £150million.’","Last quarter of 2013 saw profits up from 17 percent compared to 2012 .

"Ralph Ellis runs you through what we . learned from the weekend's football. This week, West Ham supporters show their frustrations with Sam Allrdyce's tactics, David Moyes' original back four provided Ryan Giggs with victory in his first game in charge of Manchester United while Cardiff have lost the ability to defend set-pieces... 1. The frustration of West Ham fans with manager Sam Allardyce’s route one tactics is perhaps explained by the stats for their 1-0 defeat at West Brom. Left back George McCartney did play the ball 11 times to winger Matt Jarvis just in front of him – but after that the most successful passing combination in the team was goalkeeper Adrian’s eight long punts to the head of Andy Carroll. Carroll won seven flick-ons – more than any other striker in the Premier League on Saturday – but only four of them went to a team mate. Sign of the times: West Ham fans unfurled a 'Fat Sam Out' banner during the 1-0 loss against West Brom . Route one: One of West Ham's successful passing combinations was keeper Adrian's kicks to Andy Carroll . 2. Cardiff started the season as set-piece experts at both ends of the field, but since Malky Mackay moved on have lost the ability to defend them. Connor Wickham’s header from a Seb Larsson corner that bounced in the six yard box was the pivotal moment of the 4-0 thrashing of Sunderland, whatever the debate about Juan Cala’s red card. Until Mackay was sacked by owner Vincent Tan on December 27 the Welsh side had conceded just four set-piece goals in 18 Premier League matches – in the 18 following his dismissal they have let in ten. Punished: Connor Wickham celebrates after heading home a Sunderland set-piece against Cardiff . 3. David Moyes picked the same back four - Jones, Ferdinand, Vidic and Evra - in all of his first three Premier League games as Manchester United manager. But that defensive line-up never began together again until Ryan Giggs named them against Norwich in Saturday night’s 4-0 win over Norwich, when the Reds kept their first clean sheet in a League game at Old Trafford since January. 4. The red card shown to Ryan Shawcross by Andre Marriner in Stoke’s 1-0 home defeat by Tottenham means there are now only two outfield players who have appeared in every minute of every Premier League game for their club. One is Cardiff and England centre-half Steven Caulker, the other Crystal Palace midfielder Mile Jedinak. Neither will be looking for a rest when the season ends on May 11, though.  Caulker hopes to be in Roy Hodgson’s World Cup squad, while 29-year-old Jedinak is captain of Australia’s squad to play in Brazil . Back four: Rio Ferdinand, along with Phil Jones, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra started in David Moyes first three games as Manchester United manager . Ever-present: Cardiff defender Steven Caulker (right) and Crystal Palace midfielder Mile Jedinak have appeared in every minute of every Premier League game this season . 5. Jack Cork has been a bit of an unsung hero at Southampton while England new boys Adam Lallana, Jay Rodriguez and Luke Shaw have been gaining all the attention. The 24-year-old son of Wimbledon FA Cup winner Alan has been a consistent performer in midfield and took a starring role with both the quantity and quality of his work in the win over Everton. He covered eight miles – the furthest run by any Premier League player on Saturday – but also contributed the most attacking passes of any Saints player including making two chances for team mates. Unsung hero: Southampton midfielder Jack Cork has been a consistent performer for the Saints this season . 6. Don’t know if veteran Wigan defender Emmerson Boyce has an appearance money clause in his contract – but if not he should have. The 34-year-old made his 54th appearance of the season in the 2-0 home defeat by Blackpool that leaves Uwe Rosler’s team clinging on to the last play-off place in the Championship. Rosler says tiredness shouldn’t be a problem for the Latics because the squad has been rotated in their 60 games this season at home and in Europe– but Boyce and fellow defender Leon Barnett who has played 50 matches seem to have been excluded from that policy. Selected: Emmerson Boyce, pictured against Man City's Sergio Aguero, has made 54 appearances this season . 7. Getting Pablo Hernandez fit again has been a key for Swansea boss Garry Monk in the run of ten points from six games that has secured the club’s Premier League future. The Spaniard spent much of the campaign in and out of the side with hamstring trouble, and the 4-1 win over Aston Villa was only the second time he’s finished all 90 minutes of a League game this year. He proved his value – as well as scoring the Swans crucial third goal he gave the ball away only once in the entire game. Key man: Pablo Hernandez shoots to score Swansea's third goal during Saturday's 4-1 win over Aston Villa . 8. Striker Chris Martin was allowed to leave Norwich on a free transfer to Derby last summer after Chris Hughton spent a club record £8.5million on Ricky Van Wolfswinkel. The 25-year-old, never given a real chance at Premier League level after helping the Canaries win back to back promotion, hasn’t looked back since. He got his 20th Championship goal in the 4-2 win over Watford which guaranteed Steve McClaren’s side third place in the table. Taking his chances: Derby striker Chris Martin scores his 20th goal of the season against Watford . 9. When Shaun Derry decided in February he needed a new captain for his struggling Notts County side, he turned to fellow Irishman Alan Sheehan. It’s proved a good move – the popular 27-year-old left back has been an inspiring leader in an astonishing run of six wins in eight games that has lifted the club out of the relegation zone. Saturday’s 2-0 win over Sheehan’s old club Swindon, in which he scored one of the goals, means County now need a point at Oldham on the final day to stay up. Captain fantastic: Notts County manager Shaun Derry hugs Alan Sheehan after beating Swindon . 10. Gamble of the weekend came from Northampton manager Chris Wilder, who handed 18-year-old striker Ian Toney only his second start in League football for the must-win trip to Dagenham. It paid off handsomely as the teenager, who was the youngest ever to play for the Cobblers when he made his debut at 16, scored twice in a 3-0 win. Northampton, six points from safety when Wilder left promotion chasing Oxford to take over in January, now need a point at home to his old club to stay up after taking 28 points from 19 matches under his command. Without him Oxford have sunk like a stone – just eight points from the last 14 matches means they won’t even finish in the play-off places after once looking certainties to go up automatically. Gamble: Northampton manager Chris Wilder handed 18-year-old Ian Toney only his second start in League football and the youngster went on to score twice in a 3-0 win over Dagenham .","West Ham fan's frustrations explained during defeat to West Brom .

"Warning: Doctor Margaret Chan said the virus is a threat to the whole world . Three people have died from a a deadly new SARS-like virus, taking the total death toll to 27. The unnamed victims were from Saudi Arabia and died in the country's eastern region, the Saudi health ministry confirmed today. Yesterday, a 65-year-old man died in France as health officials warned the MERS-CoV virus  is now a global threat with 49 confirmed cases worldwide. Earlier this week, the World Health . Organisation warned that the disease, first identified in humans in . September, is now their greatest global concern. The MERS-CoV virus is related to SARS, which killed some 800 people in a global epidemic in 2003. Dr Margaret Chan, head of the WHO, singled out the illness in a speech on Monday in Geneva. 'We . understand too little about this virus when viewed against the . magnitude of its potential threat,' Chan said at the annual WHO meeting. 'We do not know where . the virus hides in nature. We do not know how people are getting . infected. 'Until we answer these questions, we are empty-handed when it . comes to prevention. These are alarm bells. And we must respond.' She said the 'novel coronavirus is a threat to the entire world.' WHO said in an update earlier this . month that 20 of the 40 confirmed cases of the disease have ended in . death. Most of those infected since the virus was identified last year . had traveled to Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan or Pakistan. There also have . been cases in Britain and Germany. Saudi . Arabia accounts for the majority of confirmed cases, which stands at . 33, according to WHO officials. Global threat: The strain of novel coronavirus has now killed 27 out of 49 confirmed cases worldwide . Tunisia last week became the ninth . country in which the virus has been confirmed. It is believed the disease is transmitted mainly from person-to-person contact, but so far does not spread easily among larger communities. Authorities believe initial transmission of the virus was from animal to human but have yet to identify the animal sources. French authorities earlier this month began handing out leaflets at airports to travellers to the Middle East advising them to wash their hands frequently and limit contact with animals. The French victim had been in hospital for more than a month, spending the last 20 days in a room of the intensive care unit of the hospital where he was on life-support systems. Speaking about the death of the patient from the virus, French health minister Marisol Touraine said 'There is no cause for additional concern.'","Three unnamed victims of new virus has died in Saudi Arabia .

"Japan's new finance minister has claimed that the elderly should 'hurry up and die' to help ease the cost to the taxpayer of caring for them, it has emerged. Taro Aso made the controversial statement as he discussed how to deal with the country's emerging demographic crisis as its population continues to shrink while life expectancy soars. Aso, who said he would hate to be a burden on the state, told the national council on social security reforms: 'Heaven forbid if you are forced to live on when you want to die. 'Hurry up and die': Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said the elderly should be allowed to die sooner to cut the costs to the state of having to care for them . 'I would wake up feeling increasingly bad knowing that [treatment] was all being paid for by the government. 'The problem won't be solved unless you let them hurry up and die.' The statement is a far cry from the usual indoctrinated Japanese respect shown for their elders. It comes after figures released earlier this month showed the country saw its largest population drop in more than a century last year and is now aging faster than any other in the world. More than 20 per cent of its 128 million population is already over 65 and set to double to more than 40 per cent within the next 50 years while birthrates continues to plummet. The country faces a bleak future where there will be more dependent children and elderly than those in the age-range where they can work and contribute. Retraction: Taro Aso, pictured right next to the Bank of Japan Gov. Masaaki Shirakawa, left, later apologised for his 'inappropriate' comments . Rising welfare costs have already caused the government to double consumption tax - similar to VAT - to 10 per cent over the next three years. Aso - who is also deputy Prime Minister - described those dependent on feeding tubes as 'tube people' and said it cost 'tens of millions of yen' a month to care for them. The 72-year-old claimed he would refuse end-of-life care and that he had given his family instructions not to give him life-prolonging care. He said: 'I don't need that kind of care. I will die quickly.' His comments come ahead of expected welfare cuts due to be announced in the next budget in the next few days and enforced from April. Aso later apologised for his 'inappropriate' remarks, adding: 'I said what I personally believe, not what the end-of-life medical care system should be. It is important that you be able spend the final days of your life peacefully.'","Comments made by Japan's finance and deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso .

Users can 'train' their iPhone to read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home button, the phone is unlocked. Touch ID can also be replace an App Store password when buying music, apps or books. It uses a 'laser cut sapphire crystal' to take a high-resolution image scan before the Touch ID software in iOS 7 detemines whether the print belongs to the owner or not. All fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device's chip. The prints are not stored on an Apple server, or backed up to iCloud. One owner of the new iPhone 5S said: 'I'm glad Apple's scanner recognises . nipples - it just goes to show how ridiculous the premise is in the . first place. 'Now if anyone tries to mug me, they'll have to cut one of my nipples . off if they want to use my phone, and I'm not telling them which one.' The latest Apple handset comes with technology which means they can be accessed by placing the owner's finger on the control button. It lets owners register up to five different prints to  unlock the phone and pay for apps. Last week, technology site, TechCrunch, . wanted to test the new Touch ID feature using a cat's paw. After a few false starts, the paw was recognised as one of the owner's five chosen keys and was able . to access the phone's content. The user was also able to use the heel of his palm and his wrist in the experiment which is described as 'a broadening of the definition of what counts as a 'fingerprint'. Though different parts of the body were able to be registered and then recognised as keys, when trying to fool the phone's software by using the opposite hand than registered access was denied. The experiment pointed out however that no other animals could be used to unlock the phone as cats have unique fingerprint like paws. Another technology site, Pocket-Lint, found TouchID is not just a fingerprint sensor, but is also a toe sensor. Their tests found that a print from a toe was able to unlock the phone perfectly every time.

"Ready: Ghanain Cardinal Turkson says he is willing to serve as Pope 'if it is the will of God' The first shot in the battle to succeed Benedict XVI was fired by an African candidate for the Papacy yesterday. Cardinal Peter Turkson said ‘young churches’ of Africa and Asia were ready to provide worldwide leadership for Roman Catholicism. The intervention came just 24 hours after Benedict’s surprise retirement announcement, and signalled an open struggle for the succession between the European establishment  and the fast-growing Catholic churches of the southern hemisphere. Cardinal Turkson, a 64-year-old Ghanaian, said he was willing to serve as Pope himself ‘if it is the will of God’. The Cardinal, who has headed the Vatican office on international peace and justice for the past four years, said that African and Asian churches have produced ‘mature clergymen and prelates that are capable of exercising leadership also of this world institution’. He said that although the churches of  the south had been ‘growing exponentially’ under European Popes, a Pope from the south ‘would go a long way to strengthen them in their resolve’. Cardinal Turkson’s comments open up a rivalry between the European favourites to succeed Benedict and candidates from Africa, Asia and Latin American, whose churches are perceived as strong and growing at a time when Catholics are under pressure in their historic strongholds. Liberal complaints about gay rights and the status of women have combined with sex abuse scandals to put a question mark over loyalty to the church and its leadership in Europe and America. Congregations are also seen to be falling as Catholics lose faith in much of Europe and America. The Ghanaian cardinal, who would be the first ever black Pope if elected by next month’s conclave, said: ‘I think in a way the church is always and has forever been ready for a non-European Pope.’ Cardinal Turkson added that it was vital for the church to restore its authority in the wake of sex scandals. ‘Being the Pope of the church is not going to be an easy task,’ he said. ‘We need to repair our credibility. Our pastors need to be believed in again and recognised and taken seriously. ‘If we say we are celibate clergy, we need to live faithfully to that celibacy. There is one thing we cannot compromise on and that is our credibility.’ Cardinal Francis Arinze from eastern Nigeria has also been linked to the highest office in the faith. The election of a black pope could be controversial in parts of Eastern Europe where . racism remains a problem. Two other contenders, Cardinal Odilo Scherer, Archbishop of San Paolo, . and the French-Canadian Cardinal Marc Ouellet, would also be a break . with the tradition of electing only European popes. Nigerian Cardinal Francis Arinze is seen as an outside contender for the job . After the long reign of a Polish pope – John Paul II – and a German . pope, the Italian Catholic church will put a lot of pressure on . cardinals to support an Italian for the papacy. Among its favourites are . Cardinal Angelo Scola, Archbishop of Milan, and Cardinal Angelo . Bagnasco, Archbishop of Genoa. Benedict’s resignation shocked churchgoers and left the senior ranks of the church in turmoil. Revealing his decision to a gathering of cardinals on Sunday, he said . his ‘strength of mind and body’ had failed in the last few months. The Vatican denied that any single medical complaint was responsible but . speculation centred on 85-year-old Benedict’s arthritis problems. Italian-Argentine Leonardo Sandri could be the first non-European leader of the Roman Catholic church . He . needs a moving platform to take him to the altar in St Peter’s, and it . is difficult for him to kneel and pray. On Monday it emerged that the Pope made his decision to quit last April following a tour of Mexico and Cuba. The resignation, to take effect on the last day of this month, means a . conclave of senior cardinals will meet in Rome to choose a successor by . the end of March. He sprung his surprise at a meeting to canonise three new saints. Some cardinals didn’t understand what Benedict had told them and others . looked stunned. ‘All the cardinals remained shocked and were looking at . each other,’ said Monsignor Oscar Sanchez, who was in the room at the . time. Argentinian Jorge Mario Bergoglio (left), 77, and Honduran Cardinal Oscar Andres Rodrigues Maradiaga (right), 70, have both been tipped as potential future popes . Italians Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone (right), 78, and Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco (right), 70, are potential candidates for the position which, until John Paul II, was always held by a man from Italy . After the news was announced to the wider world Benedict said in a . statement: ‘I have come to the certainty that my strengths, due to an . advanced age, are no longer suited to an adequate exercise of the . Petrine ministry (the papacy). Odilo Scherer, 63, Archbishop of Sao Paolo, is one of the younger contenders for the job . ‘In today’s world, subject to so many rapid changes and shaken by . questions of deep relevance for the life of faith, in order to govern . the bark of Saint Peter and proclaim the Gospel, both strength of mind . and body are necessary, strength which in the last few months, has . deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognise my . incapacity to adequately fulfil the ministry entrusted to me.’ A Vatican spokesman admitted: ‘It has taken us by surprise a bit.’ The . Dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, said it was ‘a . bolt from the blue’. Among those with knowledge of the state of the Pope’s health is his . brother, Georg, 89. He said yesterday: ‘His age is weighing on him. My . brother wants more rest.’ The Pope had demanding tours ahead of him, including a visit to Brazil in July for the church’s World Youth Day. The Vatican said his immediate future will be spent at Castel Gandolfo, . the Papal villa south of Rome, and that after his resignation he will . retreat to a monastery. Tom Montgomery, a second year seminarian from the diocese of Westminster . studying at the Vatican said: ‘We were absolutely gobsmacked. Everyone . is shocked. ‘But Benedict has been a Pope of surprises. He’s changed from being the . Cardinal Rottweiler to being a German Shepherd. People said he hadn’t . the charisma of John Paul. But he is a great teacher. People came to see . John Paul but they come to hear Ratzinger.’ David Cameron said: ‘His visit to Britain in 2010 is remembered with . great respect and affection. He will be missed as a spiritual leader to . millions.’ Canadian Cardinal Marc Ouellet (left), 68, could become the first North American pope, while Austrian Cardinal and Archbishop of Vienna Christoph Schonborn (right), 68, could keep the papacy in Europe . 9/4 Cardinal Peter Turkson, 64 .

"Life saver: DIY blood pressure tests could prevent tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths . Giving patients responsibility for checking their own blood pressure has been shown to improve their condition, and could prevent thousands of unnecessary deaths . The blood pressure of those who used a new self-monitoring system at home dropped further than those who did not use it, researchers at Edinburgh University found. The portable 'telemonitoring' system allows people to record and send blood pressure readings directly to medical staff. Doctors and nurses then check the figures and, if necessary, contact the patient to discuss their health and medication. Telemonitoring was shown to encourage doctors to prescribe and patients to accept more prescriptions of anti-high blood pressure drugs, thereby reducing patients' blood pressure. Every year high blood pressure leads to more than seven million premature deaths across the globe through heart disease and stroke, experts say. In the UK there are around 62,000 unnecessary deaths from stroke and heart because of poor blood pressure control. Around 400 people aged 29-95 took part in the six-month trial. Half of them received telemonitoring while the remainder were given normal blood pressure care through their local GP surgery. Experts say that despite the availability of effective drugs, controlling high blood pressure in health centres and GP practices is poor because of infrequent monitoring and reluctance by doctors to increase medication. Often patients do not take their drugs properly. But using telemonitoring had little impact on people's lifestyle, such as their salt consumption level or weight management, scientists found. Limits: Using the telemonitoring system had little impact on people's lifestyle, such as their salt consumption level or weight management . Professor Brian McKinstry, from Edinburgh University's Centre for Population Health Sciences, said: 'We found that the use of supported telemonitoring in patients who manage their high blood pressure at home produces important reductions in blood pressure. 'We believe that telemonitoring has the potential to be implemented in many healthcare settings. Before this happens, however, we would recommend testing it out on a much larger scale so that we can see that the reduction in blood pressure over six months can be achieved in the longer term and that it is cost-effective.' The study was supported by Bupa Foundation, the Chief Scientist Office Scotland, the High Blood Pressure Foundation and NHS Lothian.","Portable system allows people to send their readings to medical staff .

"Alan Pardew has challenged two of Newcastle’s forgotten men to help save his job. The United boss admits to having had doubts about the future of Sammy Ameobi and Gabriel Obertan at the club. Indeed, Ameobi made just 10 Premier League appearances before being sent on loan to Middlesbrough last season, while Obertan was spotted just three times. Newcastle have endured a torrid start to the Premier League this season, not winning in their seven matches . Sammy Ameobi played just 10 times for Newcastle last season, but set up a goal on Saturday . Manager Alan Pardew has called on Sammy Ameobi and Gabriel Obertan (centre) to save his job . But the pair laid on the goals for Papiss Cisse during last weekend’s 2-2 draw at Swansea, a result which has eased pressure on Pardew in the short term. Obertan, 25, and Ameobi, 22, are now set to start against Leicester a week on Saturday as the Magpies go in search of their first league win at the eighth attempt. Pardew, though, says the duo still have a lot to prove to both himself and supporters. ‘We’ve had to have the patience of a saint with Sammy and he’ll admit that,’ said Pardew, who warned the younger brother of former United striker Shola that his days at the club were numbered. ‘Now we need to see him deliver. The threat to him is still there – this is a big season for him. ‘He did particularly well when he came on at Swansea. He’s someone I’ve spoken about so many times over the past few seasons, talking about his potential. ‘He’s been a young player in the shadow of his brother for a long time. But this is a guy who is quick and has fantastic technical ability – he should be ripping this division up really, but he hasn’t been. Pardew looks unhappy as he watches his team draw 2-2 with Swansea at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday . Newcastle fans have reacted angrily to their side's start to the campaign, calling for Pardew's head . ‘I was in a lift with him and his head was hitting the ceiling – he’s six foot five as well. So he has looked a lot better this season but now he has to concentrate.’ Obertan, meanwhile, has at times been ridiculed by fans following his £3million move from Manchester United in 2011, a deal which was on Pardew’s recommendation. That being the case, the manager has always hoped for more from the French winger. ‘Gabby had a great spell when he first arrived then lost his way a little bit,’ he said. ‘He’s had to earn the trust of our fans and our staff to get a chance. ‘But this season he looks really focussed. Remember, he’s only a young man and he could be a big player for us this year. Pardew looks on from the touchline during his Newcastle side's Premier League match at Swansea . Sammy Ameobi (right) and Gabriel Obertan (third left) were Newcastle's forgotten men last season . ‘We were much more of a threat in the final third against Swansea (with Obertan starting) and I was pleased for him.’ It was Cisse who got on the end of crosses from Obertan and Ameobi at the Liberty Stadium and, like the providers, he has come in from the cold this season after struggling for form and fitness last time around. But Pardew added: ‘The injury (a broken kneecap suffered in April) has probably done him a favour. It’s given him a good rest and he’s got his enthusiasm back to full tilt. ‘He’s made the difference for us and his commitment could not be faulted.’","Sammy Ameobi made 10 Premier League appearances last season .

"Jailed: Conman John Boy Hamer, 40 targeted the elderly  by knocking on their doors claiming they were missing tiles on their roofs . A builder who duped pensioners out of hundreds of pounds for repair work he never carried out was caught after one of his victims spotted him - enjoying a game of bingo. Conman John Boy Hamer, 40, of Talke, Staffordshire, targeted elderly people, some in their 90s, by knocking on their doors claiming they were missing tiles from their roofs. Between December 2012 and June 2013 he accepted £580 up front for the repair work but then disappeared. Police issued an arrest warrant after his victims reported his scam and he was finally caught when an 85-year-old man, whom he had conned, saw him at his local bingo club. Yesterday Hamer was jailed for five years after conspiracy to commit fraud, theft, fraud, four breaches of an anti-social behaviour order and failing to surrender to bail. Sentencing him at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court, Judge Paul Glenn told him: 'Your victims were highly vulnerable. 'Your convictions illustrate on a quite regular basis that you target the elderly and vulnerable.' The court head police captured Hamer after he bumped into one of his victims at a Hanley bingo hall in Stoke-on-Trent. Officers tracked him down through his bingo membership details after the OAP recognised him at Gala Bingo. Two weeks earlier he had paid him £230 for repairs to his roof - only for Hamer to take the money and never carry out the work. Prosecutor Fiona Cortese said: 'The 85-year-old man recognised Hamer as the defendant banged past him, knocking into a female. 'The defendant was traced through his bingo membership details. 'Hamer had visited his home after claiming he had bought the property next door. 'He said roof slates were dislodged, agreed the £230 fee for the work, and then went with him to a cash machine. 'The defendant took the money and put it in his pocket. The defendant said he was going to get some tools to start the work. He left and did not return. 'The victim was very disappointed to have been taken for a fool.' Gamble: Officers tracked him down through his bingo membership details after the OAP recognised him at Gala Bingo in Hanley, Stoke . The court heard an 87-year-old woman who paid Hamer £100 for roof repairs only for him to disappear when he asked her to fetch a pen. He also tried to con a 90-year-old man but he refused to pay £35 for repairs to three tiles. Police arrested Hamer at his home  in 2013. Officers seized £120, his Gala Bingo membership and several mobile phones which put him in the areas at the times the offences were committed. Joanne Wallbanks, defending, said: 'He would like the victims to know that he is extremely sorry.' Hamer was also handed a three-year driving ban because he used vehicles to commit the offences. Trading standards officials have now urged residents to make sure they get at least two quotes before having work carried out to their homes. Trading standards leader Gill Heath said: 'We strongly advise people to never go along with suggestions from doorstep traders about home improvement work or repairs. 'Residents should obtain quotes from at least one reputable trader if work is needed. 'People should politely refuse if a doorstep trader says work should be done and call the police if they feel threatened.'","John Boy Hamer scammed money from elderly residents and disappeared .

"A strain of bird flu which has killed 36 people in China can mutate to become resistant to antiviral drugs, say Chinese researchers. Shanghai doctors treating 14 sufferers of the H7N9 virus found that it had become resistant to Tamiflu in three of the patients. Researchers at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre said that while the drug reduced levels of the virus in 11 of the patients, genetic testing of bird flu in the three who did not respond to treatment showed it was able to effectively mutate to resist Tamiflu. Resistant: Three Shanghai sufferers of a strain of bird flu which has killed 36 people in China have shown resistance to antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu (pictured) They even believe that resistance in at least one of the patients was a direct result of the presence of Tamiflu. Such drugs, known as neuraminidase inhibitors, are the only known way to treat H7N9. Scientists say that they are concerned by the results of their investigation even though flu viruses have been known to mutate. The researchers said in The Lancet: 'The apparent ease with which antiviral resistance emerges in H7N9 viruses is concerning, it needs to be closely monitored and considered in future pandemic response plans.' All 14 of the patients tested had pneumonia and were placed on ventilation to keep them from dying. The team found traces of H7N9 in patients' urine, blood and stools indicating that the virus is not just spread through respiratory secretions as previously thought. Precautions: An employee wearing a protection suit sprays disinfectant on chickens at a poultry market in Hefei, Anhui, China, last month . Drugs such as Tamiflu do not cure the virus but can make the illness less severe and make recovery quicker. Overall, there have been 131 confirmed cases and 36 deaths since the first cases of the virus emerged earlier this year. There have been no new cases of the infection since May 8. United Nations experts claimed last week that the outbreak of the latest strain of bird flu has hit the Chinese economy to the tune of $6.5billion, according to NBCNews.com. Pictures emerged earlier this month of chicken farmers resorting to killing off newborn chicks by plunging them in boiling water as they faced official demands to dispose of as many birds as possible. New strain: Researchers found that the virus effectively mutated to resist treatment in three of 14 cases (file picture) The Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO) had said it had no evidence that the new strain of bird flu, which was first detected in patients in China in March, is easily transmissible between humans. Chinese scientists confirmed at the beginning of May that the H7N9 strain has been transmitted to humans from chickens. But the WHO has said around 40 per cent of people infected with H7N9 appear to have had no contact with poultry.","Shanghai doctors treated 14 H7N9 sufferers with Tamiflu drug .

"Scotland prop Euan Murray is seeking an historic win over New Zealand to put on his CV before he hangs up his boots. The 34-year-old is closer to the end of his career than the beginning and knows all too well that the All Blacks have never lost to the Scots in 29 meetings since their first clash in 1905, having been on the losing side in 2010 and 2008. The next chance to break that duck comes during the autumn Tests next month where New Zealand are the visitors to Murrayfield on November 15, a week after the visit of Argentina to the capital and a week before the match against Tonga at Rugby Park. Euan Murray's  lost both his Scotland encounters with the All Blacks in 2008 and 2010 . The Glasgow Warriors player, speaking in the city's St Enoch Centre shopping mall at a 'come and try' rugby session, admitted that he had unfinished business with the Kiwis. Murray told Press Association Sport: 'I am looking forward to it. It is a good run of games against top quality (teams) and hopefully we will get that win against New Zealand which has eluded us for the last 100 years and more. 'That would be nice. But it is always difficult when you play the All Blacks. 'They are always a good team, they have loads of talent in depth and we need to be playing our very best to beat them but I think we can do that.' Scotland prop Euan Murray attends the 'come and try' event at the St Enoch Centre on Monday . While Murray is coming down the hill in his career, Finn Russell is just starting his ascent. The 22-year-old Warriors stand-off, whose two-year contract with the Scotstoun club started at the beginning of the season, won his two caps to date against the USA and Canada in the Scots' summer tour and would be delighted just to get on against the All Blacks. Speaking at the same event, he said: 'They are a world class team, the best team in the world and if I got a run out against them then it would be a dream come true. 'I wouldn't have thought about it before I played at under-20s but after playing under-20s and getting my contract, you have to look forward. 'At the second-half of last season it became a real achievable goal. Euan Murray (back left) and Finn Russell (back right) join supporters at the event in Glasgow . 'Although they got beaten a couple of weeks ago by South Africa they are still the best team in the world. 'If they play with a full-strength team on their day, they are unstoppable.'","Scotland prop Euan Murray has never beaten the All Blacks .

"Tens of thousands of new homes have been built on green fields despite ferocious local opposition because of controversial planning reforms. The contentious measures, which threaten to change the face of rural England forever, have proved ‘catastrophic for the countryside’, says a damning new report. Planning permission had been given for a staggering 27,000 houses on greenfield sites against the wishes of local authorities in the last two years alone, it found. Scroll down for video . Tens of thousands of new homes have been built on green fields despite ferocious local opposition due to controversial planning reforms . The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), which compiled the dossier, said developer were getting the go-ahead to build properties on profitable countryside ‘through the back door’. Under the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), introduced by the Coalition in March 2012, council chiefs were instructed to ‘significantly boost housing supply’ in a bid to tackle the property crisis gripping the UK. Local authorities were ordered to identify a five-year supply of land to meet demand for new properties in their area. Britain is facing a housing shortage because not enough new homes have been built by successive governments to cope with the UK’s rapidly increasing population, much of it fuelled by immigration. Huge competition for homes that do come on the market has created a housing bubble in London and the south-east, inflating prices and locking hard-working families out of the property market. The campaign group said that of 309 planning applications for developments of 10 or more properties on greenfield land which were rejected by councillors, 72 per cent were overturned on appeal by planning inspectors. In one case, an appeal for a 154-house development in Calne, Wiltshire, which had been vigorously opposed by local people, was approved against their wishes because inspectors said the need for new homes outweighed the environmental benefits of the countryside. Video courtesy of Save Our Green Spaces . Planning permission had been given for a staggering 27,000 houses on greenfield sites against the wishes of local authorities in the last two years alone . The CPRE demanded a shake-up of the reforms claiming there were problems with how the targets for housing were set, including a lack of guidance for councils and a system which overstates demand. The group called for changes to the planning policy to prevent developers bypassing local democracy to get the go-ahead for building in the countryside, and to ensure brownfield land is favoured over greenfield sites. John Rowley, planning officer at the CPRE, said: ‘These figures show that current policy is encouraging unnecessary house building in the countryside against the wishes of local people. The consequences are proving catastrophic for the countryside. ‘We need to see a more transparent and less punitive system which does not allow unrealistic housing targets to override local concerns. ‘The Government should remove the automatic presumption for development where there is no five-year land supply. ‘Councils must be provided with detailed guidance on housing targets, and brownfield land must be prioritised so that unnecessary greenfield development is not so blatantly and regularly allowed through the back door.’","New report says the contentious measures threaten face of rural England .

"Boiling temper: Claude Bosi (pictured), Chef at the Hibiscus restaurant, called a food blogger a c*** after he gave the restaurant three stars out of five . After the starter he was served at Mayfair's Hibiscus restaurant wasn't to his taste, food blogger James Isherwood gave his meal a run-of-the-mill three out of five rating. But the review - one of 12 posts on his blog called Dining With James - left a bad taste in the mouth of head chef Claude Bosi, who took strong exception to the average rating. The two-star Michelin chef took to Twitter to  launch a bizarre tirade of abuse at Mr Isherwood - even suggesting that she should have had the 'balls' to tell him he didn't like the meal while he was at the restaurant. Mr Bosi, a widely-regarded and highly-reviewed chef, wrote: 'Nice way to gain respect with chefs...!! I think your a C*** and this its personal sorry...!!' He went on to ask Mr Isherwood if he had enjoyed his meal, to which he responded yes, he had. So Bosi ranted: 'As a man you should say something to my face when I ask, Please buy yourself a pair of balls and play with them.' The culinary community on Twitter picked up on the exchange and also started abusing the blogger, who gave a glowing review to Tom Kerridge's Hand and Flowers gastropub. But Mr Kerridge a two-Michelin-starred chef, wrote: 'Now your just being a c***! #notwelcomeinanyrestaurantever! #bellend seeya dickhead' [sic]. He followed up with 'Smash him in chef Bosi #chefsunite' and 'Who is this guy??? What a loser!!'. Claude Bosi opened Hibiscus in London in 2008 after moving the restaurant from Ludlow in Shropshire . Dining with James: Isherwood criticised the restaurant in his blog . Then Sat Bains, another two Michelin . star chef with a restaurant in Nottingham dived in: 'Heard a really good . saying once, and it rings true today!!!! @claudebosi @ChefTomKerridge . there is a c*** amongst us.!!!'. Mr Isherwood deleted his account soon after. His blog, however, still carries the review, with the offending paragrpah reading: 'I started with crab, Rose hip and crab apple sorbet, fresh walnuts. The crab came wrapped in breadcrumbs but they were so over cooked, it was just like a crab flavoured Findus crispy pancake, with the smallest dollop of puree, it's role on the plate was irrelevant.' Bosi opened Hibiscus in Ludlow, Shropshire, in 2000. Within a year he had won a Michelin star, and in 2004 he was awarded a second. The restaurant closed in April 2007 as he looked to move nearer to London,with Bosi saying: 'I'm transferring Hibiscus, not starting a new restaurant. The idea is to continue and build on what I have been doing.' The timing of the move gave Michelin inspectors only had two weeks to visit the restaurant, meaning Bosi lost his second star in 2008. In 2009, Hibiscus placed second to . The Fat Duck in UK National Restaurant of the Year Awards. Laster that . year Hibiscus' second Michelin star was restored. Rant: Tom Kerridge (left) and Sat Bains (right), . also holders of two Michelin stars, joined in the Twitter assault on Mr . Isherwood .

"Still savouring those victorious scenes from Gleneagles? On the European Tour, they’ve moved on already. In Portugal on Tuesday evening at a meeting of the Tournament Players’ Committee, the process will begin to choose Paul McGinley’s successor as Ryder Cup captain. Up for discussion are not only the candidates and the timeframe for the announcement, but the potentially crucial appointment of who will be the committee’s representative. That person will then join the last three captains (Colin Montgomerie, Jose-Maria Olazabal and McGinley) plus the tour’s chief executive George O’Grady in making the choice. The popular view is chairman Thomas Bjorn will represent the committee but that might prove wide of the mark owing to an obvious conflict of interest. Darren Clarke (left) and Miguel Angel Jiminez (right) are both in the frame to become 2016 Ryder Cup captain . Thomas Bjorn (left) celebrates Europe's 2014 Ryder Cup victory with Sergio Garcia . If the Dane doesn’t throw his hat into the ring this time, he would rightly be a strong candidate to be captain in Paris in 2018. In which case, should he be voting on the captain for 2016 when he would be virtually guaranteed that vote regarding his own candidature in France? If Bjorn doesn’t stand to be captain this time, we’re seemingly down to a fight between Darren Clarke and Miguel Angel Jimenez, and what a fascinating contest that promises to be. Here you have two leading representatives from two different schools of thought. On the one hand you have a man who has won the highest honour the game can bestow and been a rock in previous Ryder Cups; on the other you’ve got Jimenez, a McGinley-type figure who might not have won majors but understands the Ryder Cup and knows what it’s like to captain a team of his peers. Of the five who will make the decision, it’s reasonable to assume Monty will go for Clarke and Olazabal for his fellow Spaniard. O’Grady will hope to be spared the casting vote. Paul McGinley (centre) has vowed to put his differences with Clarke (left) aside when picking his successor . As for McGinley, he is too decent a man to let his well-documented fallout with Clarke have an overriding bearing on his decision. Rather, he will put in his usual due diligence, ask the leading players what they think and take it from there. Which leaves the players’ representative, and clearly a key man in deciding a contest that presently looks too close to call. Expect the captain to be announced early in the New Year at a glitzy press conference in London or at Wentworth. So much for the thought American interest in the Ryder Cup might wane because they keep losing. For evidence, just witness the extraordinary bloodletting that has been going on over the past week, culminating in captain Tom Watson’s remarkable mea culpa statement over the weekend. They care, all right. My favourite moment was PGA of America president Ted Bishop highlighting the fact that 2012 captain Davis Love was the only American incumbent this century who had been blooded in the manner of each European skipper, in first serving an apprenticeship as vice-captain. This from the man who appointed Watson, who hadn’t been near a Ryder Cup in over 20 years! American 2012 Ryder Cup skipper Davis Love III served as vice-captain before his appointment as captain . Forgotten amidst all the hankering for the return of Paul Azinger and his ‘pod’ system that proved successful in 2008 was the fact that Love was actually a really good captain at Medinah. He just got unlucky when Justin Rose holed a couple of putts from downtown on that miraculous Sunday. As for the next American captain, there’s a perfect candidate staring them in the face and it isn’t Azinger, who’ll just give the thing a nasty edge. Steve Stricker is their Paul McGinley. ‘I regret that my words may have made the players feel that I didn’t appreciate their commitment and dedication to winning the Ryder Cup. I was their captain and, in hindsight, whatever mistakes that were made were mine.’ US Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson walks the higher ground following locker-room revelations from Gleneagles. What could possibly have made the players feel unappreciated? Perchance Tom’s less-than-inspiring rallying cry, on the eve of Sunday’s singles: ‘This team sucks’? Oliver Watson poses with his Dunhill Links trophy after his victory at the Old Course on Sunday . What is it about men from Nottingham and finding their way back at the Dunhill Links at St Andrews? Eleven years after Lee Westwood won there to kickstart his journey from the wilderness all the way to world No 1, we now have the heartwarming story of Oli Wilson and his incredible victory on Sunday. How wonderfully typical of this sport that the all-conquering world No 1 should get to the 17th, the most famous hole in the game, and putt from off the green into the Road Hole bunker, while the world No 792, who had never won anywhere, should play a clutch 80-yard shot to 3ft. Given all he’s achieved this year, it probably took Rory McIlroy five minutes to get over his disappointment; for Wilson, it was the moment he had waited for all his life.","Candidates and timeframe for captaincy announcement to be discussed .

"A half-brother to 2010 King George winner Harbinger, sired by Galileo, topped the Tattersalls Book One sale when sold to a bid of 2.6million guineas (£2.73m) from Coolmore Stud supremo John Magnier on Thursday, . More than 79m guineas (£82.95m), a new record, was spent over the three-day auction in Newmarket, 17m-plus guineas by Sheik Mohammed's bloodstock adviser John Ferguson. A half-brother to 2010 King George winner Harbinger, sired by Galileo, topped the Tattersalls Book One sale . After an extremely slow start, when he was even available for the minimum bid of 5,000 guineas, the Ashbrittle Stud-consigned youngster eventually reached an incredible 2.6million guineas when the hammer went down to Magnier after a battle with John Warren. 'When the bidding opened at 5,000 guineas, I just wanted the ground to open up,' said Ginny Whales, who led up and had looked after the colt at Ashbrittle. 'When it stuck again at 60,000, I thought the boss was bound to sack me - how could we have got it so wrong! I am just delighted and amazed at the price.' The colt is reported to be the world's most expensive yearling sold this year. Lot 245, a Dubawi colt sells for 1.6m guineas during the Tattersalls sales in Newmarket on Thursday . John Ferguson, bloodstock adviser to Sheikh Mohammed, had made three six-figure signings on Wednesday and he beat Al Shaqab Racing to Lot 398. 'He came to us in July and was always a stunning, straightforward colt, always easy to deal with and always oozed class,' said Charlie Vigors of consigners Hillwood Stud. 'It is easily our biggest sale and it is a fantastic feeling.' The day started off briskly when James Delahooke spent 1.25million on a Galileo three-quarters sister to Derby winner Pour Moi. 'She was my pick of the sale,' Delahooke told Tattersalls' website. 'I tried very hard to buy a filly by Bernardini filly earlier this summer, but was beaten by John Ferguson. 'This is the nicest filly I have seen since - she ticks all the boxes, she is gorgeous. She is for Bobby Flay and will probably race in Europe.'","John Magnier came out top in bidding duel with John Warren .

"Rangers shareholder Mike Ashley has made a move to oust directors Graham Wallace and Philip Nash from the Ibrox board. Ashley, the owner of Newcastle United, upped his stake in the Scottish Championship club six days ago, increasing his stake in the Glasgow giants to 8.9 per cent. Now the Sports Direct owner - widely rumoured to be plotting a push for more control - has called for an emergency general meeting. Mike Ashley has increased his stake in Rangers to 8.92 per cent the Glasgow club . The current Rangers board have said they will fight to save Wallace and Nash's positions in a statement to the London Stock Exchange statement, saying: 'The company announces that it has received a notice from Mike Ashley. 'The notice states that MASH holds 4,265,000 Ordinary Shares of 1p each in the Company amounting to five per cent of the voting rights of the Company. 'MASH requires the company to call a general meeting of the shareholders of the company and to put certain resolutions to shareholders for inclusion in the business at such a general meeting of the company. 'The notice puts forward resolutions for the removal of Graham Wallace and Philip Nash as directors of the company. The company is currently verifying that the notice is properly constituted. 'If valid, the board intends to seek to have such notice withdrawn in order to avoid the cost and disruption of an ad hoc general meeting particularly given the company's forthcoming annual generl meeting, further details of which will be announced in due course. 'The board is united in its support of the executive team. If the notice is valid and is not withdrawn, the directors intend to recommend that shareholders vote against the proposed resolutions. A further announcement will be made shortly.' Wallace, the club's chief executive, has recently held a series of meetings with Paul Murray and George Letham, allies of former director Dave King. Rangers shareholder Ashley has made a move to oust directors Graham Wallace (centre) and Philip Nash . King has offered to invest up to £30m in the club in the past and is now investigating ways to grab control without rewarding the current directors he blames for the club's malaise. A new share issue has been a stated aim of the board as it seeks to raise funds before another cash shortfall arrives at the end of the year. That could allow King to make a substantial investment and seize control, but any such move would obviously weaken the existing powerbase at the club. Ashley already has strong commercial interests at Rangers through retail contracts with Sports Direct. He also owns, but is yet to activate, the naming rights to Ibrox – reportedly purchased for £1 from former chief executive Charles Green. Ashley’s latest move raises questions as to whether he wants to prevent the board agreeing a deal with King and instead steer them down a different financing route. Wallace and Nash are viewed as being in favour of the option provided by South African-based businessman. Ashley is currently limited to a Rangers stake of under 10 per cent through an agreement with the SFA, as part of their rules on dual ownership, but it is thought he held unsuccessful talks with the club about a loan prior to last month’s stop-gap share offer that raised £3.13 million. Rangers currently sit second in the Scottish Championship, six points behind Hearts . Ashley did not invest in that process but instead waited to increase his stake by buying shares from fund managers Hargreave Hale - a move which meant his money did not go towards aiding the perilous financial position at Ibrox. The sportswear tycoon will need the backing of more than 50 per cent of shareholders if his bid to remove Wallace and Nash is to be successful. Sandy Easdale, chairman of the football board at Rangers, has yet to make any comment about the EGM request but has previously publically stated his support for further involvement by Ashley at Ibrox. Easdale currently holds voting rights over a shareholding block of around 26 per cent. Should that group all be in favour of axing Wallace and Nash then it would still leave Ashley seeking another 15 per cent. Laxey Partners are the club’s largest single largest shareholder with just over 16 per cent and have their own representative on the board in Norman Crighton. The Stock Exchange statement insisted the board was ‘united’ in backing Wallace and Nash. However, with various other shareholder factions now assessing their options, Ashley has fired the first shot in a battle that could prove pivotal to the future direction of Rangers.","Mike Ashley, the owner of Newcastle United, upped his stake in the Scottish Championship club to 8.9 per cent last week .

"Jozy Altidore has threatened to quit Sunderland unless he is given more first-team opportunities – but the USA striker has scored just once in 35 Premier League appearances. The 24-year-old – a £6.5million signing from AZ Alkmaar in 2013 – netted his only league goal last December and has drawn a blank in 23 top-flight matches since. But Altidore – who scored 23 times in his final season in Holland – has warned the Black Cats that he will leave in January if he doesn't win a regular starting spot. Sunderland striker Jozy Altidore (left), pictured in training with the USA, has threatened to leave the club . Altidore is unhappy about a lack of first-team opportunities at the Stadium of Light this season . 'I thought I'd done everything I could this season to come in as fit as possible with the injury (hamstring strain suffered at the World Cup) and try to make an impact when I've played,' he said, having found the back of the net in the League Cup defeat to Stoke last month. 'But this four years I want to be part of the national team. Jurgen (Klinsmann, USA manager) makes his message very clear, nobody is different, so if it doesn't turn around, then in January I'll be looking to start elsewhere and make sure that I'm in his plans.' Sunderland boss Gus Poyet praised Altidore following his strike in the cup but he has not been seen since, failing to emerge from the bench during the goalless draw with Swansea and 3-1 win over Stoke. Altidore scores his only goal of the season against Stoke in the Capital One Cup . The ex-Villarreal striker has netted just one Premier League goal since his £6million move from AZ Alkmaar . His struggle echoes that of his season on loan at Hull five years ago. Then only 19 but with a big reputation after joining Villarreal for £6m from New York Red Bulls, he scored one goal in 28 outings and was sent off – against Sunderland – in the defeat which confirmed Hull's relegation from the top flight. Altidore is currently away on international duty and is unlikely to feature when Poyet's 13th-placed side return to action at Southampton next Saturday.","USA striker Jozy Altidore has only scored one goal in 35 Premier League appearances since joining in the summer of 2013 .

"Sean Dyche revealed he uses the popular view that Burnley are ‘doomed’ to relegation as a way to inspire his players. The Clarets’ first goals for 47 days, including a 96th minute Ross Wallace strike, rescued a draw and had Dyche praising the spirit of his side. ‘Virtually everyone outside our club thinks we’re doomed about one minute after we got promoted last season,’ said Dyche, ‘I’m happy to say we don’t think that. Burnley boss Sean Dyche is hoping his side can build on their 2-2 draw with fellow new boys Leicester . Ross Wallace (centre) celebrates with Stephen Ward (right) and Michael Keane (left) after scoring late on . ‘We haven’t spent a lot of money and we’ve got a group where many haven’t played regularly in the Premier League. But we’ve also got a group who are very honest, who want to learn, want to improve and want the challenge.’ Burnley have mostly relied on solid defensive performances to get results. On Saturday they broke the club record for most minutes played without a goal before Michael Kightly ended the drought with a 39th-minute equaliser. But Dyche said he had not put pressure on his strikers. ‘Goals have been tricky to come by for sure,’ he said, ‘I think that (first goal) can release some pressure and we went out and got a second and you just feel a bit more relaxed about it. Burnley forward Danny Ings (left) is expected to return to action after the two-week international break . Ings, who scored 26 goals in the Championship last season, picked up a hamstring injury in September . ‘Brian Clough once said to Teddy Sheringham scoring goals it’s the hardest thing in the world. Then he reminded him he did it 251 times in 274 games, so a typical Clough moment. ‘I know that and I don’t put any pressure on our strikers. They do what they do and I was a defender and I think it’s really hard to score goals. They’ve got the freedom to go out and score goals and I believe it will come.’ Dyche is looking forward to the international break and the return from injury of Danny Ings, who scored 26 goals in last season’s Championship campaign but said it was too soon to say his side had turned a corner. ‘One result doesn’t define the next one,’ he said, ‘But what I know is it’s more like how I want the team to perform.’","Sean Dyche has admitted he uses the fact that most people have tipped his side to go down to his advantage .

"Calum Chambers' fairytale start to the season continued with what Adam Lallana called a 'magnificent' full England debut against San Marino. The past few months have been a whirlwind for the versatile defender, who in the summer made a £16million move from Southampton to Arsenal. The 19-year-old has since featured heavily in the Champions League, started on numerous occasions in the Barclays Premier League and made his England debut from the bench against Norway last month. Adam Lallana has praised former Southampton team-mate Calum Chambers after he made his England debut . Adam Lallana came off the bench as England beat San Marino 5-0 at Wembley on Thursday night . Chambers followed that up on Thursday night with a first start for England as Roy Hodgson's men easily swept away San Marino 5-0 at Wembley. 'He was magnificent,' England midfielder Lallana said. 'It was not an easy game for him. 'He was always going to have lots of the ball and take risks with his passes because that's what happens against teams that camp behind the ball. 'He showed great composure and is going to go on to have many, many more caps.' Lallana knows Chambers better than most, having played alongside him at Southampton. Chambers (left) and Lallana (right) were key members of the team as Southampton impressed last season . Lallana says he knew Chambers would end up playing for a 'top, top club' like Arsenal . The full-back only made his top-flight debut for Saints at the start of last term, but his rapid progress since then has not surprised his former captain. 'I knew it was a matter of time before he possibly moved on or went to a big, big club,' Lallana said. 'It hasn't surprised me at all how quickly and how well he's started.

"England's jubilant players were bounding out of the Cibalia Stadium, reflecting on an outstanding night, but Gareth Southgate was already looking forward. It didn’t matter that England had sent records tumbling, from reaching a fifth consecutive appearance at the Under 21 European Championships to securing a 10th successive win, Southgate had already started contemplating another major issue. Can England now start winning at a major tournament? Or, to be more specific, can they actually win a game against the best young players on the continent? Recent history, after all, has shown they have been anything but proficient in doing that. England Under 21s took the lead through Liam Moore (second left) in the first half in Vinkovci against Croatia . England U21 manager Gareth Southgate celebrates after guiding his team to their 10th consecutive victory . Match report from England's 2-1 win against Croatia (4-2 on aggregate) Though they have been fixtures at the last four tournaments, reaching the final against Germany in Sweden in 2009, their win ratio has been miserable. They have played 14 matches in that period but been successful in just four of them. What’s more, the last two tournaments, under Stuart Pearce’s watch, were wretched affairs, a two draws and a defeat in Denmark (in 2011) were followed by three straights losses in Israel (2013), in a group that contained the hosts, Norway and Italy they should ought to have negotiated. Why did it go so wrong? Squad strength was an issue. Pearce had good reason to complain in Israel that he was dealt a bad hand, given the FA chairman of the time David Bernstein admitted there was more importance on a friendly in Brazil than the tournament in Israel. That cost Pearce, primarily, the presence of Arsenal’s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. But it wasn’t just that. Pearce wanted to ensure his players stayed in first class facilities but choosing a plush golf complex in the middle of nowhere was not, in hindsight, a wise move for young men who were susceptible to boredom and the atmosphere suffered as a result. England secured their place at the 2015 European Under 21 Championship with play-off win against Croatia . England and Southgate may now look to start winning at a major tournament after sending records tumbling . Also, the fixtures they played before Israel were wrong. The FA tried to get decent opposition but they end up facing cakewalks against Northern Ireland, Sweden, Romania and Austria. Come that first match in Israel against Italy, England were undercooked. Southgate, however, is savvy. He has fostered a remarkable close-knit spirit in his group and trusts them with responsibility. When away in Lithuania last month, he gave them down time, telling the players they were free to explore Kaunas on a day off. Not one of his squad abused that trust. The set up at this moment in time is right and it should also be noted the impact that Southgate’s assistant Steve Holland makes, putting on sessions that the squad respond to. The chemistry is right between the two men and they command the squad’s respect. Yet Southgate is also wise enough to know the only things that general public will be interested in next June is results. If England were to go to the Czech Republic and fall flat on their faces once more, nobody would be pay attention to the good work of the last 13 months. That is why Southgate and his staff will leave no stone unturned going forward. Already friendlies have been lined up for next month against Portugal – a game which is set to be staged in Burnley – and France and tough opposition will be sought out for the international break in March. Norwich winger Nathan Redmond (right) battles for the ball with Croatia's Marko Pjaca (left) So while he was immensely satisfied as he began the journey home on Tuesday night, a man who represented England on 57 caps occasions as a player was not prepared to sit back and admire what he had just seen. For Southgate, this has to be the start of a sustained spell of class. ‘I just want the players to keep knocking barriers down and perceptions down,’ said Southgate. ‘I know what I want an England team to look like and the challenge for us next summer is to go over there and prove that. We have got Portugal and France lined up to play in November. They are the types of tests that we need. It was a bit like Toulon. That set us up for Croatia. We had to go through those defeats (lost to Brazil, Portugal) and learn when the right time was to kill the game, when was the right time to play and buy fouls. Our game management was really good. ‘What I really want is for us to go to the Czech Republic and play in the manner that we have been. It is difficult to do that (be exciting) in a qualifying tournament as the games are different. If we want to be successful, we have to be a possession based team.’","England secured their place at the 2015 European Under 21 Championship with play-off win against Croatia .

"Asked to appraise the influence Martin O’Neill has had on his career, Shaun Maloney finds it difficult to express sufficient gratitude. From being handed a Celtic debut at Ibrox aged just 18 to the later chance of English Premier League football with Aston Villa, O’Neill has provided so much impetus for the Scotland midfielder. That genuinely-felt debt will not, however, prevent Maloney from trying to give his former manager a very unhappy return to Parkhead next month. Shaun Maloney celebrates his equaliser for Scotland against Poland in Warsaw on Tuesday night . O’Neill’s Republic of Ireland side will travel to Glasgow in buoyant mood after securing a last-gasp 1-1 draw with world champions Germany on Tuesday night. This next encounter now promises to be a vital staging post for the Euro 2016 hopes of both nations, with Maloney eagerly anticipating his reunion with O’Neill. The Wigan man continued his fine form for Scotland by netting the opening goal for Gordon Strachan’s side in their 2-2 draw with Poland in Warsaw. Like O’Neill, Strachan has been hugely significant in Maloney’s career, drawing arguably his most consistent form during their time together at Celtic. ‘I think I just understand what a good manager Martin O’Neill is,’ said Maloney. ‘It is no surprise to me that he has got Ireland playing the way they are. He is a superb man-manager, he really is. ‘Listen, a lot better players than me have spoken highly of Martin O’Neill so that underlines what he is about. ‘I think I am indebted to him for giving me an opportunity in the professional game, when he really didn’t have to. Particularly at that stage in my career. I was only 18 and wasn’t really a regular in the reserve side at Celtic or anything like that. Maloney (left) battles for possession of the ball with Poland's Grzegorz Krychowiak during the Group D qualifier . ‘To be honest, it’s probably similar to the view I have of the Scotland manager just now. I don’t think I can put into words how thankful I am. But, obviously, I am hopeful that Martin doesn’t have a positive result next month. ‘That is the game. He will be trying to win and his assistant manager Roy Keane was a superb player who I was fortunate enough to play 12 or 13 games alongside at Celtic. They will be trying to win every bit as much as we will. ‘It is a really mouth-watering game coming up but you could also say the same about the matches against Georgia and Poland that we have just had. ‘Every player has tough times in their career, whether it is long-term injuries or whatever. But nights like these – and hopefully more to come – make everything worthwhile.’ Hampden’s decommissioning from use in the Commonwealth Games has taken Scotland on the road at the end of 2014. Having seen off the Georgians at Ibrox, Maloney has his sights on maintaining a 100 per cent home record in Glasgow’s east end. ‘Playing Ireland at Celtic Park is going to be an amazing occasion for everyone involved,’ he admitted. Republic of Ireland head coach Martin O'Neill gives instructions during his side's 1-1 draw with Germany . ‘The atmosphere in the stadium in Warsaw was fantastic, too. When they got their equaliser, the place was really rocking for the last 10 minutes. ‘I’m looking forward to a similar atmosphere for the team at Celtic Park. It should be fantastic. ‘I’m not sure if Ireland’s result against Germany changes anything in my eyes. I always knew they were a good side. ‘What it probably does is strengthen the idea of just how important this next match will be. ‘At the Georgia game, I spoke about how I believe the home games will be really important. But then after the way we played in Poland, I now think we can get more points away from home than maybe I first thought.’ Maloney placed a low shot into the net for a first-half equaliser against the Poles. It was a goal of superb construction, with Steven Fletcher and Ikechi Anya both heavily involved. ‘The only thing I remember about it was Anya’s cutback but I think that was the kind of goal we have been trying to aim for in the team,’ added Maloney. ‘We had some similar moves against Georgia without managing to finish them so it was good to get a team goal like that at an important moment in the match.’ Maloney (right) is challenged by Manchester United's Paul Scholes in 2003 during his time at Celtic . Maloney is not the only Scotland player with experience of playing under O’Neill. Goalkeeper David Marshall famously performed heroics for Celtic when pitched into action against Barcelona as a 19-year-old. A decade on, he now hopes to throw up the shutters once again to frustrate his old boss. ‘It’s going to be a huge game,’ admitted Marshall. ‘We were expected to beat Georgia but it was a hard game. Now this Ireland match will be a big one in terms of the group. ‘Ireland got a late point against Germany but there’s nothing we can do about that. We can only control our own destiny. ‘We’ve been happy with the performances but we are a bit disappointed in the points return. Hopefully we can now get back to Scotland and have a couple of home games where we can get maximum points. ‘I’m sure both Gordon Strachan and Martin O’Neill are looking forward to this next game. ‘It will get everyone excited, with both of them going back to Celtic Park. I’m sure it will be a great atmosphere and I just hope it turns out all right for us. ‘Ireland have had a good start and Poland have had a great result against Germany, so it makes the home games that much more important for us.’ Scotland goalkeeper David Marshall (left) comes to collect the ball during the 2-2 draw against Poland .","Scotland take on the Republic of Ireland in a Euro 2016 Group D qualifer at Celtic Park on November 14 .

"Goalkeeper Joe Hart is likely to have been concentrating so hard while England were romping to a 5-0 victory in their Euro 2016 qualifier over San Marino at Wembley, he could have given himself a headache according to former number one Ray Clemence. Manchester City stopper Hart was a virtual bystander as the Group E whipping boys were eventually well beaten by Roy Hodgson's men, making just one save and only touching the ball some 19 times. Hart was cheekily voted man of the match by an online poll ran via England sponsor Vauxhall, although midfielder Jack Wilshere collected the post-match champagne having been finally confirmed by the stadium announcer following a telling pause. Joe Hart was hailed for his concentration against San Marino by former England keeper Ray Clemence . Clemence is a former England coach and player, winning 61 caps in an eleven-year international career . However, Clemence - who won 61 caps between 1972 and 1983 before later going on to work as a coach within the national team set-up - insists Hart's contribution should not be taken lightly despite a perceived lack of match action. Clemence, who is ambassador for Prostate Cancer UK and is supporting the new Men United Sports Quiz, told Press Association Sport: 'Although Joe had nothing to do, it was still a big test for him because you have 50,000 people there and you still have to concentrate for 90 minutes knowing that you might only have one save to make. 'I have been in that situation many times with England and also with Liverpool. 'I used to get really bad headaches after a game just through concentrating, shutting everything else out to make sure that I was switched on if I had anything to do.' Clemence, 66, continued: 'You try to shut everything else out and just play the game in front of you. 'You play behind the ball, wherever that ball is you adjust your position to be in the right position, so that if anything happens very quickly you are in the right position. 'You are not just stood watching it, you won't be moving around, so you are playing your own game behind the 10 outfield players.' England's victory maintained their perfect start to Euro 2016 qualification, but Hodgson's men will face a much sterner test away to Estonia on Sunday. Hart was barely troubled as he won man of the match for England against San Marino . England boss Roy Hodgson has plenty of young talent at his disposal as they head towards France 2016 . Clemence - who played some 470 games for Liverpool, winning five championships and three European Cups, and then made more than 200 appearances for Tottenham - believes the current England squad have what it takes to make an impact should they as expected reach the finals in France. 'Obviously there was lots of youth on show at Wembley and there will also be I am sure against Estonia,' said Clemence, who successfully battled against prostate cancer in 2005, but has since been receiving treatment again after the disease returned. 'The great thing about this group is because its an easier group its going to give Roy a chance to bed some of the younger players in, for them to get experience that hopefully when we qualify, which we will do, then they are in a position to do us proud.'

"The defeats get harder to take, the near misses more difficult to shrug off. Scott Brown is only 29 yet, already, the Scotland midfielder has begun to dread the creeping advance of years – and the threat of ending his career with one great football ambition frustratingly unfulfilled. Brown, one of several in the current squad who will be in their 30s by the time France 2016 comes around, believes that the quality of the current group – the best he's seen, says the Celtic skipper – and the extended nature of the European Championships means Scotland have never had a better chance of returning to a major finals. Yet the combative all-rounder admits that the fear of being part of yet another failed campaign – this is his fifth crack at the big time – motivates him as much as anything. VIDEO Scroll down as Scott Brown say he thinks Scotland deserve to get to France 2016 . Scott Brown (centre) believes Scotland will have to show courage if they are to beat Georgia on Saturday . Brown, whose own 38-cap international career has taken in two unsuccessful tilts at reaching the Euros *and* a couple of ultimately disappointing World cup qualifying runs, said on Friday: 'I think, when I was younger, I never appreciated it as much as I did now. 'Looking back on those campaigns, I was thinking: 'Oh, we didn't get there again. We're devastated – but we'll try next time'. 'Now I'm starting to think: ""I might never get there"". There are a few people in that dressing room the same age as me, maybe even a wee bit older, who probably think the same way as well: ""We've not got long left in the game, so we desperately want to get to a major finals"". 'For Darren Fletcher, as well, this is huge. He wants to get to a Euros and it's one of the few things not on his CV, as well. Pretty much everyone in the dressing room - well maybe not young Ryan Gauld! – remembers France '98 and what a great occasion that was. 'We want to get that belief back that Scotland isn't just a team that turns up for one or two games but can do it over a whole campaign. 'France is definitely the biggest one for us. We all want to try everything to get there — leave nothing out on the park. It would mean more to us than anyone in the country. As a Scotland fan myself, I know it would be great for the whole country. 'It definitely bothers me. I don't want to look back over my career and be saying: ""If I had only done this, if I'd only done that..."" I've got to give 120 per cent. Everyone in that changing room is the same, giving everything to get there . 'We know it's been a long time since France 98. We think we've got the quality to get there again and, with the extra qualifying place as well, that will definitely help.' It's good to hear Scotland players talk about the hurt, acknowledging the pain of failure as keenly as the most devoted supporter. If the possibility of never making it motivates this bunch to new heights, in a campaign where the top two in each group win an invite to the expanded finals, all the better. Brown knows expectations are high as Scotland dream of ending their 18-year exile from major tournaments . Brown, one of two frontrunners for the captaincy in Saturday's home match against Georgia, insisted on Friday that quality and a sense of shared responsibility gives this group an edge over some of its predecessors. 'It's definitely the best chance we've had to qualify, because it's the best group of lads I've been in,' he said. 'You can see the team bonding. It's not people sitting over here and there in little groups – everyone can chat to everyone. 'The manager has done a lot, bringing players in, talking to them himself. Those are maybe the little differences that will hopefully get us there. 'There is no room for egos. All the lads are down to earth – and I think they all realise that anybody could take their place. 'We've brought in the likes of Gauldy and Stevie May, who have been excellent in training this week. 'It's good to see people like that up close in training. When you play against them, you maybe don't notice how good they are unless you're directly up against them. 'When you train with them, you see how good they are at linking up. Wee Ryan has been a joy to play with. 'When you look at the squad, it's probably the strongest I've been involved with. It's looking good, training has been brilliant. 'We've played 11 v 11 with subs, as well. And you look at the subs and think: 'He could bring on anyone here and still have a strong 11'. So it's looking great. 'There are players for every position. There are 11, 12, 13 great players – and then you think: ""Wow, look at the players coming in on top of that. Jeez, they could easily take someone's place"". Brown on Scotland's qualifier: 'We've got to be brave and play attacking football especially at Ibrox as well' Brown remains one of two frontrunners for the captaincy in Saturday's home match against Georgia . 'It's great for competition, it makes everyone raise their game – and you can see that in training over the last couple of days. 'We've got top quality players so we should be at tournaments - but we need to work together as a group. We're doing that to the best of our ability now.' On the captaincy issue, Brown remains in the dark. Full of praise for main rival Fletcher, he concedes that being handed the armband is a tremendous honour; there is more than a hint of him wanting the leadership role. Yet he's wary not to put personal ambition before national interest, noting: 'Whoever goes out there, we've got a lot of great leaders who want to win. That's what you need. 'We are all desperate to win, all desperate to be in France. And we believe we can do it – we all believe it. It's not about fighting over a captaincy – it's about joining together and being more of a team than ever.' Relaxed and at ease, Brown gave off the air of a man confident of his place in the squad. And Saturday's starting XI, for that matter, although he joked about the 'national debate' over the captaincy issue, saying: 'I thought that was all over … it was a no vote, wasn't it?' As for a return to Ibrox, a venue familiar only to those Celtic players with at least a few years' service under their belts, the man who added to his cult status with one particular Old Firm goal celebration said he was looking forward to the experience. If nothing else, being applauded at this particular stadium will be a new one for him, although he ducked an obvious question about whether he'd be 'Doing a Broony' in the event of scoring for his country, declaring: 'I don't even know if I'm playing!' Maybe he wasn't expecting his place to be confirmed until this morning, when Gordon Strachan was due to officially announce his starting XI, subs and skipper. But Brown sounded like a man who knew he was part of the manager's plans. A man desperate to make every appearance count. Before it's too late.","Scotland face Georgia on Saturday evening in Euro 2016 qualifier .

"West Ham co-chairman David Sullivan says Sam Allardyce has built the best squad since he bought the club, and has re-introduced the 'West Ham way'. The Hammers sit seventh in the Barclays Premier League, having won three of their opening seven fixtures, after Allardyce was backed in the transfer market over the summer. It is a far cry from last season when, in the midst of an injury crisis, the club's fans were calling on co-owners Sullivan and David Gold to replace Allardyce - with many pointing at the style of play as their main gripe with the former Bolton and Blackburn boss. Sam Allardyce was criticised last season but has got West Ham playing better football this year . Allardyce has moved Stewart Downing to the centre of midfield as part of a tactical adjustment this season . But Sullivan believes the 59-year-old deserves credit for adopting a diamond formation which has brought the best out of the likes of Stewart Downing, as well as new signings Alex Song, Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia. 'There is a lot of optimism about the place now,' Sullivan told the Evening Standard. 'I genuinely believe we have the best squad since we've been at the club. We've signed some high-energy, younger players and we have discovered the 'West Ham way'. 'He (Allardyce) changed the style after that to a diamond formation. Sam made that decision so he deserves the accolades because, had it not worked, he would have been castigated.' New signing Diafra Sakho has been excellent since arriving, scoring five times in six games . Sakho and Downing celebrate after combining for a goal as West Ham have made a strong start in the league . Victories over Liverpool and QPR, as well as an entertaining draw at Hull, have followed the new formation as Allardyce starts to win over his detractors. With a move the Olympic Stadium coming ahead of the 2016/17 season, the pressure will be on to not only keep West Ham in the Premier League but to be a club striving for trophies - and Allardyce will hope to be the man who takes them into their new home. The owners opted to keep him at the helm at the end of last season despite the clamour to see him sacked but, with Allardyce's current deal expiring in the summer, it will depend on results between now and then as to whether he leads West Ham into a fifth season. Former Arsenal and Barcelona midfielder Alex Song has been another exciting addition to Allardyce's squad . Downing holds off Crystal Palace's Joel Ward during one of West Ham's three Premier League wins . Allardyce implements another tactical switch, for which David Sullivan has given him plenty of praise . 'We have a policy - and it's as much for Sam as us - that we sit down at the end of the season, maybe a bit earlier if we're safe, and judge things over an entire season,' Sullivan added. 'We've always done it that way. Last year I was being asked at various times if Sam would be going but my answer was always that we'd look at it at the end of the campaign. We're very loyal to our managers . 'We always talk on a Monday or the day after a midweek match and if he has a problem he calls me. We all want the same thing and that is the best for this club. Sam wants to be successful and he's very flexible at looking at ways to achieve that. 'The change in formation was not my idea - he's the one who made that bold decision to change the strategy.'

"Click here to read Sportsmail's exclusive interview with Stewart Downing . Stewart Downing believes West Ham should target European football for next year after their impressive start to the new season. After last weekend's 2-0 win over QPR, Sam Allardyce's seventh-placed side sit above Arsenal and Liverpool in the Barclays Premier League and are just three points behind third-placed Southampton. The Hammers have earned plaudits for their attacking brand of football with Downing the heartbeat of their positive performances. Stewart Downing hopes West Ham can target European football after a strong start to the season . The former £20million Liverpool star's magnificent form prompted boss Allardyce to hail him as the 'best midfielder in the league'. Downing is quick to play down his manager's glowing praise, however. But he does hope to continue to shine as he looks to guide West Ham into Europe for the first time since 2006. 'It's a great compliment. Maybe exaggerated a little! But as a player it gives you great confidence and I'm really enjoying playing right now,' he said, answering questions from West Ham supporters on the club's official Twitter feed. Diafra Sakho (left) and Downing (centre) celebrate West Ham's second goal against QPR last weekend . 'Realistically, I don't see why we can't aim for Europe if we carry on like how we've started.' Downing has been successfully remoulded by boss Allardyce as a central midfielder in recent weeks, playing behind strikers Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho. And the former Middlesbrough and Aston Villa winger revealed he is relishing his new role in the team. 'The new players have settled quickly and the formation is working well,' he said. 'At the minute, the way the team's playing, I prefer playing behind the strikers.' 'Obviously I'd like to score more goals, but as long as I'm playing well and the team is I don't think about it.' Despite calls for Downing to win back his place in national side, boss Roy Hodgson has overlooked him for England's Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia. Roy Hodgson chose not to select Downing for his most recent England squad . Speaking exclusively to Sportsmail's Matt Lawton last week, Downing admitted he was disappointed to have been overlooked, adding the likes of fellow Hammers' Mark Noble and James Tomkins also deserve a chance. 'Maybe he just wants to go for younger players, which I guess is fair,' said the 30-year-old. '(Noble) has been doing it consistently for seven or eight years. And James Tomkins. 'I think there are a few players who should feel disappointed. ‘But sometimes it’s difficult. You see the squad and there are a lot of players who are not playing for their clubs, but they’re getting picked.' Downing believes West Ham team-mate Noble should have been called up to the recent England squad . Hodgson shouts instructions as Downing looks on during the England Training session in 2012 . Downing, who has 34 international caps to his name, insists he would love to pull on the Three Lions jersey again telling Hammers' fans on Thursday that he would be delighted to answer any future call-ups. 'Realistically, I'm not sure I'll get picked but if I am I'd love to play.' Downing, meanwhile, revealed West Ham's 2016 move to the Olympic Stadium played a huge part in his £5million switch from Anfield last summer. 'It's a big part of why I came here,' said Downing, who also confessed to enjoying the East End's favourite dish pie and mash. 'If we keep going the way we're going we'll head there in a good position.'

"Former New Zealand captain Chris Cairns appeared in court on Thursday to face a charge of perjury linked to a libel action he brought in the UK in 2012. Cairns won £90,000 in damages after he sued Lalit Modi, founder of the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament, over an accusation of match-fixing made on Twitter in January 2010. But the 44-year-old was accused of perjury last month and appeared on Thursday at Westminster Magistrates' Court in central London. Former New Zealand cricket captain Chris Cairns leaves Westminster Magistrates Court on Thursday . Cairns, of Clifton Road, Herne Bay, Auckland, appeared alongside barrister Andrew Fitch-Holland, who faces one count of perverting the course of justice. Fitch-Holland, 49, of Duddenhoe End, Saffron Walden, Essex, is described on his chambers' website as 'lead adviser to former NZ captain Chris Cairns in his libel action against former IPL head Lalit Modi'. The pair, dressed in dark suits, spoke only to give their names, dates of birth and addresses, and deputy chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot sent the case to Southwark Crown Court with the next hearing on October 16. Cairns faced one count of perjury linked to a libel action he brought in the UK in 2012. They were given unconditional bail.

"On a night when German football seeks redemption in the Ruhr Valley, Martin O'Neill's presence on the touchline in the Veltins Arena may cause further angst for the under-fire world champions. Home fans of a mature vintage can recall the central role played by O'Neill, as a player, when Germany lost two games in a qualifying campaign for the first, and so far, only time. On November 16, 1983, O'Neill captained Northern Ireland to a famous 1-0 win over West Germany in Hamburg — the same day, incidentally, the Republic of Ireland mauled Malta 8-0. Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill believes Germany will qualify for Euro 2016 comfortably . Midfielder Wes Hoolahan (centre) scores in the Republic's 7-0 thrashing of Gibraltar at the Aviva Stadium . Norman Whiteside grabs Northern Ireland's winning goal against West Germany in Hamburg in 1983 . It followed a 1-0 win in Belfast a year earlier, yet Billy Bingham's battlers were cruelly denied a place in the 1984 European finals on goal difference by the team they conquered. To this day, Germany have never lost twice in the qualifiers for a major finals but that would happen should the Republic of Ireland tonight follow up Poland's win over the world champions. In that event, O'Neill would have a unique connection to the events, as a player and manager. Any form of 'a result', he acknowledged last night would give the squad 'a massive lift' ahead of the final qualifier of 2014, away to Scotland next month. O'Neill doffed a forelock to the four-time world champions, by insisting they would still top Group D comfortably. 'They have a habit of qualifying,' he observed. 'I think Germany have had a history of roaring back pretty quickly from whatever setbacks they have.' West Germany's Norbert Meyer (right) attempts to get away from Northern Ireland's Paul Ramsey in 1983 . Winger James McClean celebrates scoring the first of his two goals against Gibraltar . It followed Joachim Low's briefing earlier where he spoke casually about the 2016 finals as if he had already booked training grounds, hotels and put their poolside towels down in France. Being the efficient Germans, they probably have. O'Neill didn't disagree that the game carried echoes of his Champion League duels against Europe's elite with Celtic. But he didn't tarry long over nostalgia. 'This isn't Celtic. This is us. We've got to perform. Easy words, I know, but that's what it will come down too,' he said. A lthough they are unbeaten at home in 18 competitive games, if ever there was a good time to play Germany, tonight's engagement is as opportune as any. Rocked by retirements following their World Cup triumph, and riddled by injuries to front-liners, there is indecision in the ranks following the unexpected loss to Poland where inefficiencies in front of goal cost them dear. Germany don't lose qualifiers, and have never lost successive ones. Low is demanding a response this evening — and there will be hell to pay if he doesn't get one. Germany manager Joachim Low kicks the ball back during his side's defeat against Poland . Poland players celebrate Arkadiusz Milik's opening goal against the world champions in Warsaw . Ireland had the advantage of a light warm-up against Gibraltar on Saturday, where an overdue cavalcade of goals has injected a welcome wave of confidence. 'If you said before the campaign started that we'd be sitting here tonight with six points on the board, nine goals, you'd have taken it,' said O'Neill, who feels the Irish mind-set tonight will be similar but the 'approach' to the game will differ. 'We have a game plan which we hope can frustrate [Germany] and work to our advantage. That said, the best-laid plans can disappear. 'If we sit in all day, they will pick you off. It's a game to relish and one we want to go out and get something from.' O'Neill, who gave training in Gelsenkirchen a skip last night after a morning session in Malahide, was keeping his cards close to his chest over his likely starting XI. He knows it but the players don't and will be kept on their toes until a couple of hours before kick-off. Prior to his hat-trick on Saturday, Robbie Keane was vulnerable to sacrifice as the lone ranger in attack. But Keane has a presence about him and the Germans will be wary of his threat and reputation — they haven't forgotten his last-gasp equaliser in Ibaraki in the 2002 World Cup. Keane fed off a Niall Quinn knock down that night and has never sparkled away from home as a sole striker. Most recently, he was isolated against Georgia, and was substituted. Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer (centre) kicks the ball away in frustration after conceding to Poland . Springing him from the bench if Ireland need a goal may be the most profitable way to use him for a more demanding contest such as this. O'Neill spoke of Keane in glowing terms last night, insisting he 'saw no reason' to change his captain when he became manager and spoke of his 'excellent influence' in the squad. Pointedly, he warned against 'assuming' that Keane would start. As for the Ireland captain, who is usually chipper before game, he was strangely subdued — perhaps he is fearful of being told to bring a long coat to the game. 'Whenever the manager names the team, you've got to respect his decision. My job is to score goals and I go into every game believing I can,' he said. Even so, changes are certain tonight with Glenn Whelan and Stephen Quinn pushing to start in central midfield after missing the Gibraltar game. The back five should remain intact which will see John O'Shea become the sixth Irishman to complete a century of caps — an outstanding achievement for a model pro. 'The fact that John has been picked by so many different Irish managers tells you a lot about his qualities,' said O'Neill. A year ago, a makeshift Irish XI rolled into the Rhineland under Noel King's interim management, and were unfortunate to lose 3-0, while 12 months previous, Germany skittled Ireland for six in Dublin. If any motivation spur was needed, those results should provide it. Getting a result won't be easy, it never is against the Germans but Ireland, even without Seamus Coleman and James McCarthy, have a couple of things going on their side. They have momentum, a rising self-belief, a striker on top form, and a manager who has never been intimidated by the reputation of German football. Against the 'wounded animal' of Germany, such dynamics could be sufficient to keep the Euro 2016 roadshow upright.","Germany host the Republic of Ireland in a Euro 2016 qualifier .

"Jozy Altidore says Sunderland have to get nasty if they’re to avoid a repeat of last season’s struggle. The Black Cats have yet to win in the Premier League this season and were knocked out of the League Cup by Stoke on Tuesday. Gus Poyet’s team are only outside the relegation zone – where they resided for much of the last campaign – by virtue of goal difference and take on fifth-placed Swansea at the Stadium of Light on Saturday. Jozy Altidore scored for Sunderland on Tuesday and says the Black Cats need to get nastier as a team . Altidore's goal was his first in 30 matches, and only his third since joining the club last summer . Altidore broke a 30-match goal drought against Stoke and the USA striker could now keep his place for the visit of the Swans. And the £6.5million frontman – criticised having scored just twice in over a year – believes Sunderland have been too soft in front of goal. ‘We need to be tougher,’ he said. ‘It is too easy sometimes. All of us, strikers, everyone, have to be nastier and make sure when people play us they have to really work for it. The American striker is determined to help Sunderland avoid another relegation scrap like last season . ‘There is room for improvement. We have to play better and we have to get the first win. ‘We don't want the shadows of last season following us around this season. We have had a decent start and now with the home schedule we have we have to take three points. ‘Swansea are a team you look at. They have built something, they stay consistent and their identity shows. We have to all come together at Sunderland and make that happen.’ Meanwhile, former England winger Adam Johnson could find himself out of the side this weekend after an indifferent start to the season. Manager Gus Poyet has been left frustrated by his side's winless start to the Premier League campaign . Adam Johnson has started the season poorly and could be dropped on Saturday for the visit of Swansea . Winger Will Buckley, signed for £2.5million from Brighton this summer, could replace Johnson for the match . Poyet has promised £2.5m wideman Will Buckley a start against Swansea and Johnson, who lost possession in the build up to Stoke’s winner during the week, is under threat. And Buckley said: ‘It (Poyet’s promise) was good to hear personally. ‘Obviously I've come here and I want to play. I've been bought to produce. Swansea have made a very impressive start to the season, with Gylfi Sigurdsson in excellent form . The Swans are fifth in the Premier League and beat Everton 3-0 on Tuesday in the Capital One cup . ‘Hopefully I can get minutes in the Premier League to show that. All the players who haven't been playing are eager to play. ‘But we definitely need to win at least one of these two (at home to Swansea and then Stoke). ‘It’s not been a bad start to the season but we have to get off the mark as quickly as possible. ‘And getting that first league win will give everyone a big confidence boost.’","American striker Jozy Altidore says Sunderland must be tougher if they are to have a successful season .

"An array of high-profile international cricketers — including disgraced former New Zealand batsman Lou Vincent — will be called to a London court next year to give evidence in the Chris Cairns perjury case. Cairns learned on Thursday he will face charges — which The Mail on Sunday understands will be formally laid on September 25 — over allegations he lied in court after being accused of being involved in match-fixing by former Indian Premier League boss Lalit Modi. The Indian businessman, whose lawyers are understood to be preparing a case against Cairns, paid about £90,000 in damages to Cairns in 2012 after Modi failed to prove claims that the former New Zealand and Nottinghamshire all-rounder was involved in fixing matches. Former Kiwis allrounder Chris Cairns was named in an ICC investigation into match fixing in December . Chris Cairns took over 200 Test wickets for New Zealand during a career that spanned 15 years . But evidence given to the Metropolitan Police by Vincent, who has been banned for life after admitting fixing matches included a County Championship game between Sussex and Kent in 2011, has led to Cairns’s evidence being called in question and left perjury charges imminent. A number of his former team-mates, including Vincent and current New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, will be called to give evidence against Cairns if, as expected, the trial goes ahead in London next May. Earlier this year, McCullum gave evidence to the ICC’s anti-corruption unit in which he claimed he was approached by a former top player, dubbed ‘Player X’, who asked him to fix matches. Cairns publicly acknowledged he believed McCullum was referring to him but has repeatedly denied match-fixing. The Mail on Sunday has learned the following players will be called to give evidence at the trial: Andre Adams, Shane Bond, Nathan Astle, Stephen Fleming, Chris Harris, Kyle Mills, Daryl Tuffey, Daniel Vettori and Chris Harris. The strong all-rounder racked up over 8000 international runs during his career, just 50 short of 5000 in ODIs . The charges related to a libel action brought against former IPL chief Lalit Modi .

"Disruptive pupils who wreck the schooling of millions will be given an ‘unambiguous lesson in who’s boss’, the Education Secretary vowed yesterday. In a new war on ill discipline in the classroom, Michael Gove will loosen rules on the use of physical force by teachers and increase penalties for parents who allow their children to play truant. The tough measures are part of a crusade to ‘restore adult authority’ over what Mr Gove described as an ‘educational underclass’. I'm the boss: Teachers will be put firmly back in charge of the classroom under new measures introduced yesterday, which aim to 'restore adult authority'. (Posed by models) He said respect for adults had been ‘subverted by a culture of dutiless rights’ which encouraged the young to ignore civilised boundaries. In a strongly worded speech, the Education Secretary said last month’s riots had highlighted the growing gulf between what he called a ‘hard-working majority’ and a ‘vicious, lawless, immoral minority’. He insisted it was clear that Britain’s social malaise had its roots in the breakdown of discipline in the home and the classroom. New war: Michael Gove has unveiled a number of powers for teaching staff in a bid to improve discipline in the nation's schools . Mr Gove said there was an ‘iron-clad link between illiteracy, disruption, truancy, exclusion and crime’ which the Government must try to break. Measures to hand back powers to teaching staff and improve discipline include: . Mr Gove, in a speech at an academy school in South London, said the culture of children’s rights had been twisted to undermine adult authorities. ‘The right every child deserves, to be taught properly, is currently undermined by the twisting of rights by a minority who need to be taught an unambiguous lesson in who’s boss,’ he said. Many pupils were failed in primary schools because their behaviour was not policed with proper boundaries and they were not taught how to read properly. By the time they arrived in secondary school, they were unable to follow the curriculum and covered up their failure with shows of bravado and disruption. ‘For all the advances we have made and are making in education, we still, every year, allow thousands more children to join an educational underclass. They are the lost souls our school system has failed,’ Mr Gove said. ‘It is from that underclass that gangs draw their recruits, young offenders’ institutions find their inmates and prisons replenish their cells. ‘These are young people who, whatever the material circumstances which surround them, grow up in the direst poverty – with a poverty of ambition, a poverty of discipline, a poverty of soul. ‘I recognise that using a word like underclass has potentially controversial connotations. It can seem to divide society into them and us. But I believe there’s a merit in plain speaking.’ Mr Gove said problems began even before school, with primary teachers reporting increasing numbers of children arriving at school  ‘totally unprepared to learn’, unable to hold a pencil, unable to sit and listen, unable to use the lavatory and, in some cases, unable to  communicate. Inappropriate: Andy Burham, Labour's education spokesman, said he did not think it was helpful for Mr Gove to talk of an educational underclass . ‘Some express their frustration through displays of inarticulate rage,’ he said. Mr Gove said the latest figures showed that 1,200 children aged seven or under had been permanently excluded from primary schools for violence or other disruptive behaviour in the past five years. A further 53,000 in the same age group were suspended. The Education Secretary said regulations brought in by Labour on the use of force were inhibiting teachers’ judgement. ‘So let me be crystal clear, if any parent now hears a school say, “Sorry, we can’t physically touch the students”, then that school is wrong. Plain wrong. The rules of the game have changed,’ he said. And on truancy, he revealed that more than a million children are absent for 10 per cent of the school year. ‘We need to review the sanctions schools, police, the courts and the Government have available,’ he insisted. Responding to the speech, Labour’s education spokesman Andy Burnham said: ‘I don’t think it’s at all  helpful for the Education Secretary to talk of an educational underclass.’","Michael Gove vows to 'restore adult authority'

"Tory MP Charles Walker said it would be 'extremely unpopular' but he would take the pay rise . Tory backbencher Charles Walker today became the first MP to say he would accept a controversial 11 per cent pay rise. The . MP for Broxbourne acknowledged that his remarks would be extremely . unpopular but he had never turned down a pay rise before and I don't . intend to start any time soon'. It came as it emerged MPs and ministers could still pocket the inflation-busting pay hike as the main party’s rowed back . from vowing not to accept it. Downing Street refused to say that David Cameron would not accept the £7,600 hike recommended by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority. And the Labour party was forced to deny reports it was planning to block all of its MPs from accepting the salary rise in a ‘cost of living’ stunt. Instead Ed Miliband called for cross-party talks to stop the idea going ahead. IPSA is expected to ignore public anger to confirm this week that announce salaries for MPs should rise to £74,000 from 2015. The dramatic rise will leave MPs earning roughly three times the national average salary and comes at a time when most other public sector workers have had pay rises capped at just one per cent. All the main party leaders have rounded on Ipsa for ignoring the public mood when recommending the rise. But there is chaos in each of the main parties about whether or not they will accept the extra money. Mr Walker claimed MPs were being treated as 'cannon fodder' in the row and the public did not want MPs setting their own pay rates. He told Sky News: 'This is going to make me extremely unpopular and my inbox is going to fill up with hate mail. 'I have been a professional for 25 years and I’ve never turned a pay rise down in my life and I don’t intend to start any time soon. 'And I’m not going to turn the pay rise down because I don’t want my constituents thinking they’ve either elected a millionaire to represent them, or a saint. I am a flawed human being with many deficiencies, but I will be accepting the pay rise.' He said the public did not want MPs to set their own pay: 'What my constituents told me and what the media told me is that they didn’t want Members of Parliament anywhere near their pay, and this is the consequence of that. 'Now, of course, if the Prime Minister and leader of the opposition don’t like what is being proposed, they can scrap IPSA but then we’ll end up where we were before, which is Members of Parliament – or perhaps, even worse, the Prime Minister – deciding on what we’re paid.' Worth it: An opinion poll revealed people in every part of the country thought MPs should earn less than their current salary of £65,738, with Scots suggesting just £50,110 . Austerity: More than eight in 10 people said MPs should have a pay freeze or cut and less than a third thought MPs worked hard . Many people have been left baffled by the sight of MPs claiming they do not want a pay rise - but doing nothing to stop it. The bizarre situation can be traced back to the 2009 expenses scandal. MPs . pay had barely increased for many years, but perks to claim everything . from taxis and food to furniture and home improvements became more and . more generous. But the . scale of expenses abuse was revealed, MPs handed the right to decide . their pay and allowances to the new Independent Parliamentary Standards . Authority. The move was intended to take the issue out of the arena of political controversy. But . Ipsa has largely ignored warnings from party leaders not to push . through a steep pay rise at a time when most people have seen wages . squeezed. In an . anonymous survey conducted by Ipsa earlier this year, MPs suggested that . they should be paid an average of £86,250, with one-fifth of those . questioned saying they should get £95,000 or more. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond . yesterday warned ‘this is not the moment’ for a big pay rise and . suggested the Cabinet would collectively vote to refuse it. But today Downing Street left the door open for the rise to go ahead, and suggested a decision might not be made for two years. Asked . whether the Prime Minister would accept the rise, Mr Cameron's official . spokesman told a regular Westminster media briefing: ‘I don't believe . Ipsa have made a formal proposal yet. Any proposal that they make will . be reviewed in mid-2015. ‘The Prime Minister's long-standing position is that the cost of politics should go down, not up. ‘He doesn't think that MPs' pay should go up while public sector pay is being restrained.’ Asked . if the Prime Minister continued to have confidence in Ipsa, the . spokesman said: ‘He thinks that it was right for Parliament to come . together and make the decisions that it took with regards to making pay . independent.’ Meanwhile Labour has been forced to deny rumours that party leader Ed Miliband was planning to announce that 257 of his MPs would refuse to accept the rise. A Labour spokesman said: ‘It is right that MPs' pay is now set by IPSA. IPSA's proposals are not out until Thursday and when we receive them we will study them. In any case they will be reviewed in 2015. ‘We have always said that any decision on MPs' pay must be taken in the light of the current economic situation and the cost-of-living crisis facing families up and down Britain.’ Mr Miliband later called on David Cameron and Nick Clegg to enter talks on stopping the rise. He said: 'If the package of proposals being set out by Ipsa is as reported it cannot go ahead.' Labour MP John Mann today tabelled a . motion warning against a pay rise at a time when public sector workers . face a freeze or a cap on wages. He said: 'It is nonsense to suggest that if MPs are not given this pay increase we will lose ‘talent’ to other professions. 'MPs should not be doing the job for the salary – I certainly did not check the salary before deciding to stand for Parliament. 'MPs’ pay should rise in line with public sector workers. Anything more would . send the message that MPs are out of touch with the rest of the . country, and are not prepared to live by the rules they set for their . constituents.' Against: Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander told Andrew Marr he will not take the money . Also unhappy: Labour leader Ed Miliband and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg have also blasted the figure . Labour’s shadow chancellor Ed Balls has branded the idea of a pay rise ‘preposterous’. He said Ipsa appeared to have come to its conclusions ‘entirely out of any context of the real world’. However . former Labour home secretary Jack Straw said that while there is ‘never . a good time to increase MPs' pay’ refusing to do so would unfairly . deter ‘people from modest backgrounds’ from entering Parliament. Several MPs including shadow health secretary Andy Burnham and Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb said they would forego the pay rise. Labour MP John Mann . Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the public would find it ‘utterly incomprehensible’ if Ipsa defied concerted calls from Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Nick Clegg to show restraint. Tory MP David Ruffley said: ‘It is an inconvenient truth that MPs’ pay has fallen behind other equivalent occupations for some years, such as the judiciary.’ But there was also anger that Cabinet ministers like Mr Hammond, who earns £134,000 a year and made millions from business, are expected to call on MPs not to take their pay rise. One Tory MP said: ‘It’s easy for ministers to tell the rest of us not to take the money when some of them are paid more than twice what backbenchers get.’ Sources close to Ipsa said the package would be cost-neutral, with pensions cuts paying for the higher salary. But short of passing a law to abolish Ipsa, it won’t be possible to hand back the money. One insider stressed: ‘They’ll get the money. What they choose to do with it is a matter for them.’","Broxbourne MP admits his comments will be 'extremely unpopular'

'As part of their diet, crocodiles consume cane toads but it's the poisonous glance from the toads that will usually kill the crocodiles. 'We've got the Bunuba Rangers involved, consultants, volunteers and universities, so we're really amped to be out here doing such an important work.

"Former UKIP candidate in Clacton Roger Lord has attacked the 'fools' who run the party . The UKIP councillor ousted by rebel MP Douglas Carswell as the party’s candidate in Clacton has quit, with a bitter departing shot at the ‘fools’ who turfed him out. Roger Lord was forced aside after Mr Carswell – the sitting Tory MP in the Essex seat – last week defected to UKIP and stood down from Parliament to fight a by-election. UKIP leader Nigel Farage announced that Mr Carswell would stand for UKIP in the resulting October 9 by-election, despite Mr Lord having already been selected as the party’s candidate. After Mr Carswell announced his intention to stand for UKIP Mr Lord angrily threatened to ‘rip his throat out’. But Mr Lord has said it is ‘time to draw a line under this’. He said: ‘In mountaineering terms it’s time to cut the rope and touch the void, and see what life brings.’ He added: ‘I was talking to Nigel Farage three or four weeks ago, telling him what I was doing in Clacton, and he said ‘I very much doubt Douglas Carswell can be unseated’. ‘It was not a targeted seat for UKIP, but I said I could win. But Nigel Farage didn’t let on and he knew from the off. 'I think he could have confided in me and told me not to waste my time, instead of me being deselected as candidate and told to quietly shuffle off. ‘According to the rules I have the right to address the national executive but I was rung up and sworn at and told to shut up. I don’t want to deal with fools like that. ‘There are bigger things in life and I don’t want to sink to that level. I know they say politics is a dirty game, but it is not really, it is an intellectual battle between two parties.’ He added: ‘What insults the people of Clacton is that this was a deal made during a discreet meal in Mayfair in London. ‘But will Stuart Wheeler [a key UKIP donor] come down to Brooklands in Jaywick and tell people how their future candidate was decided?’ Mr Lord, of Great Bentley, is now backing Liberal Democrat Gary Scott, Tendring district councillor for Alresford, to take his county council seat. Scroll down for video . The 57-year-old farmer, last week suggested Mr Carswell had only ‘jumped ship’ to UKIP because he knew he was going to lose  at the next election. He accused him of simply ‘looking after himself’. But Mr Carswell defended his decision to join UKIP and rejected accusations that he had been disloyal to the Prime Minister. He said: 'I stab people in the front, not the back'. Mr Carswell returned to his Clacton constituency last week with UKIP leader Nigel Farage amid speculation eight more Conservative MPs considered defecting. He said: ‘I like David Cameron, he's a nice guy, he's actually good fun. ‘I don't think I've ever stabbed anybody in the back, maybe I occasionally stab one or two people in the front but I've been frank and straight with people. Mr Carswell's decision to fight a by-election as UKIP’s candidate - instead of sitting in Parliament until the general election next year - was described Mr Farage as the most honourable decision in his life time. It came amid claims up to eight more Conservative MPs have held intensive talks with UKIP about defecting.

East Worthing - Conservative . Thurrock - Conservative . Grimsby - Labour . Eastleigh - Lib Dem . Portsmouth South - Lib Dem . After the shock defection of Mr Carswell a source told the Daily Mail that the threat of a mutiny went far beyond just one MP. It is understood that Mr Carswell was among nine Tories wined and dined by millionaire UKIP donor Stuart Wheeler at a series of discreet lunches in Mayfair. ‘Stuart is quietly confident that more may follow Douglas,’ a source said, adding that the MPs were happy to talk to Mr Wheeler – a former Tory who defected to UKIP – ‘because they knew he understood their sense of divided loyalty’. ‘Stuart understood what they were going through because he had been on the same journey,’ the source said. Mr Cameron was ambushed by the defection of Mr Carswell – a serial rebel – who quit the party with a parting blast that questioned the Prime Minister’s policy on Europe. The MP announced he was joining UKIP and forcing a by-election in his Clacton constituency in Essex, which will be a nightmare for the Tories to defend despite their 12,000 majority in 2010. Mr Cameron was given no prior warning of the announcement and could only watch as Mr Farage triumphantly paraded Mr Carswell live on TV. The dramatic move has increased pressure on the Prime Minister to toughen his stance on immigration and Europe to stem the risk of further defections. Tory whips were scrambled to ring round Eurosceptic MPs to shore up support. A senior Tory source insisted that Mr Carswell appeared to be a ‘lone wolf’ and played down the prospect of further departures. And Mr Cameron angrily dismissed Mr Carswell’s move as ‘self-defeating’. ‘It is obviously deeply regrettable when these things happen and people behave in this way,’ he said. ‘But it is also, in my view, counter-productive.’ Mr Farage claimed he had been involved in talks with a number of Tory MPs over the past six months who ‘very strongly support everything Ukip is trying to do’. He predicted that further defections will follow if Mr Carswell triumphs in the by-election, which is likely to be held in the week after the Tory party conference. ‘The real answer to the question about how many others will join, will all depend on this by-election,’ he said. ‘This by-election is going to be a High Noon moment.’ Former Conservative MP  Douglas Carswell defected to UKIP last week and is the firm favourite to hold his seat in next month's by-election . Mr Carswell, an early supporter of Mr Cameron’s leadership bid, said the Prime Minister was ‘not serious about change’ when it came to the EU and was only interested in doing the minimum needed to win an election. Speaking at a press conference in London alongside Mr Farage, he said: ‘The problem is that many of those at the top of the Conservative Party are simply not on our side. They aren’t serious about the change that Britain so desperately needs. Of course they talk the talk before elections. They say what they feel they must say to get our support... but on so many issues – on modernising our politics, on the recall of MPs, on controlling our borders, on less government, on bank reform, on cutting public debt, on an EU referendum – they never actually make it happen.’ Mr Carswell’s decision to trigger a by-election leaves the Conservatives facing a huge battle to prevent him becoming Ukip’s first elected MP. He has built a Tory majority of over 12,000 in what had been a Labour seat.","Original candidate Roger Lord was ousted after Douglas Carswell defected .

"Almost two years ago, Neil Lennon masterminded Celtic's famous Champions League victory over Barcelona - now he's at the bottom of the Championship. The former Northern Ireland midfielder was appointed manager of Bolton on Sunday and has one of the most difficult tasks in English football as he looks to arrest Wanderers' alarming slump. Lennon concedes he has a 'big job on his hands' at a club who are £160million-plus in debt where losing has become a habit, and the fact he has taken the Bolton post highlights problems facing British and Irish bosses (although there are five managers in the Championship with experience as a Champions league boss). He turned down more lucrative offers abroad and will hope to lead his new club up the Championship table. Here's his in-tray at the Macron Stadium... Neil Lennon during his first training session as Bolton manager on a filthy day in the North West . Lennon shakes hands with Dorian Dervite as Kevin McNaughton looks on . BUILD FROM THE BACK . Bolton are too easy to beat and concede goals at an alarming rate. In their last two matches they shipped four at Fulham and let in two against 10-man Bournemouth - both matches were lost. In fact, Bolton have won the joint-fewest games in the Football League this season - their solitary victory coming over Rotherham. Lennon knows how to organise a defence - last season Celtic keeper Fraser Forster set a Scottish Premiership record for minutes without conceding a goal. Some of that solidity is needed at the Macron. Hugo Rodallega (right) scores Fulham's first goal in Bolton's 4-0 defeat at Craven Cottage earlier this month . PICK A SETTLED TEAM . Lennon's predecessor Dougie Freedman seemingly made changes for the sake of it or to show how clever he was. Despite bemoaning in an interview that he was never able to have a settled side, the Scot would make three or four alterations to his line-up and often put square pegs in round holes. Lennon also, as Mike Bassett might say, needs to play 'four-four-f****** two', especially at home - in that win over Rotherham, Bolton played with two up front and Joe Mason scored a hat-trick. It is easy to forget there are some good players in this Bolton squad - Matt Mills was bought for £5million not so long ago, Jay Spearing has played in an FA Cup final, Lee Chung-yong has scored in two World Cups - but Mark Davies is the spark and one of the best players in the division when fit. He needs to be nurtured. Joe Mason (right) scores one of his three goals against Rotherham  in Bolton's only league win this season . GET THE FANS ONSIDE . Bolton supporters do like a moan (name a club where fans don't grumble) but there is a huge disconnect at the moment between the club and their followers and home attendances are falling off a cliff. Many were unimpressed by Freedman's apparent disdain for them, randomly-generated team selections and haughty air in press conferences, and some made their feelings known by invading the pitch in his last home match in charge against Derby. Lennon says he wants to play in the style that will 'make the fans happy' and goals and victories should do the job. Bolton fans  made their feelings against Dougie Freedman known with this banner, and need encouraging again . SEE WHETHER THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT . A club that is £160m-plus in debt cannot keep relying on loan players and Lennon must aim to bring through lads from the academy and give them a chance in the Championship. The likes of midfielder Josh Vela, striker Conor Wilkinson and defender Joe Riley are rated by those who know but spend more time out on loan than around the Bolton first team. If, as looks likely, there is another season outside the top flight, the money will dry up even further and the kids will make up more of the side. Lennon would be wise to introduce some of them gradually. Conor Wilkinson (second right) has a shot on goal for Oldham, where he is on loan from the Trotters . IT'S A COMPETITIVE DIVISION . OK, so maybe this is a bit of a cheap shot at the Scottish Premiership, but leading Bolton to survival after their horror start will be a tougher job than winning the title with Celtic. The cliche about the Championship is that it is the hardest division to get out of and while Wanderers would prefer to stay in it, Lennon will have to adjust to his team not being favourites in virtually every match they play. It seems he and his assistants Johan Mjallby and Garry Parker are up for the challenge. Lennon turned down a £2m-a-year offer to manage in Saudi Arabia. It has to be assumed that Lennon, who has signed a three-year contract at Bolton, is looking to get a Premier League job by doing well at the Macron. The fact he has to drop to the bottom of the Championship is a potential worry for other managers from these shores. But at least Lennon knows the only way is up. Former Celtic boss Lennon lifts the Scottish Premiership trophy in May before later leaving the club . Bolton parted company with Freedman after a dismal run of results in the second tier . Neil Lennon (Bolton) - managed Celtic in the Champions League . Sami Hyypia (Brighton) - was boss of Bayer Leverkusen . Steve McClaren (Derby) - took charge of FC Twente and revealed his dodgy Dutch accent . Darko Milanic (Leeds) - managed Slovenian side Maribor in Champions League qualifying rounds . Jose Riga (Blackpool) - lost in Champions League qualifying rounds as Standard Liege boss .","Neil Lennon has been named as Bolton Wanderers' new manager .

The Skellig Rocks, Skellig Michael (also known as Great Skellig) and Little Skellig, are towering sea crags rising from the Atlantic Ocean almost eight miles west of the Ivereagh Peninsula in County Kerry. Located at the western edge of the European landmass, Skellig Michael was the chosen destination for a small group of ascetic monks who, in their pursuit of greater union with God, withdrew from civilisation to this remote and Inaccessible place. Some time between the sixth and eight centuries, a monastery was founded on this precipitous rock giving rise to one of the most dramatic examples of the extremes of Christian monasticism. The monastic community appears to have moved to the mainland by the thirteenth century but the island continued to be venerated as a place of pilgrimage in the following centuries. In the nineteenth century, two lighthouses were built on Skellig Michael, establishing its importance in Ireland’s maritime history. Skellig Michael is also one of Ireland’s most important sites for breeding seabirds both in terms of size of colonies and diversity of species.

"The Prime Minister faced fresh embarrassment last night after it was revealed that his new party treasurer funded his son’s membership of the notorious Bullingdon Club, which Mr Cameron belonged to when he was a student at Oxford. Michael Farmer – a City financier who has donated more than £2.6million to the Tories – helped son George meet the high cost of joining the invitation-only, 200-year-old male dining club, whose members are renowned for their excessive privilege and wild antics. During George Farmer’s time in the Bullingdon Club, its members were accused of going on the rampage at a smart hotel. Revelations: Prime Minister David Cameron, left, faced fresh embarrassment last night after it was revealed that his new party treasurer, Michael Farmer, funded his son’s membership of the notorious Bullingdon Club . Mr Farmer also bailed out Oxford’s Conservative Association when a racism row led to it being kicked out of the university. His son was a senior official at the time. There is no suggestion George Farmer, now a 22-year-old investment banker with Jefferies & Co, was involved in the hotel incident or the race row. The disclosures come as Mr Cameron faces increasing criticism that he leads a ‘Government of chums’ out of touch with the struggles of ordinary families. Mr Farmer became Mr Cameron’s co-treasurer just two weeks ago, after fellow tycoon Peter Cruddas was forced to resign over the so-called ‘donorgate’ scandal. Mr Cruddas was secretly recorded offering access to No10 dinners with the Prime Minister in return for a £250,000 donation to Conservative coffers. Mr Cameron had hoped the swift appointment of Mr Farmer would put an end to the controversy. Instead, it has merely provided more ammunition for those who claim his inner circle is drawn from a rich and privileged elite. The . Bullingdon uniform alone costs more than £3,500 and club dinners cost . hundreds of pounds, effectively restricting membership to the wealthiest . students at Oxford University. Privileged: George Farmer (second from left) - son of Tory Treasurer Michael Farmer - who is a former President of the Bullingdon Club. This photo was taken at Oxford Conservative Association event at Trinity College . Since becoming Tory leader, Mr Cameron has tried hard to shrug off his Bullingdon Club past. However,  as a new Mail on Sunday poll shows today, far right, he has failed to do so. Shown two photographs, one of Mr Cameron in his Bullingdon sky-blue bow tie and tails, and a recent one of Mr Cameron as he would prefer to be seen, dressed in jeans drinking a pint of beer in a pub, most people chose the former as the ‘real Cameron’. Mr Farmer, dubbed ‘Mr Copper’ after . making £100 million from metals trading, was appointed just three months . after enjoying a ‘kitchen supper’ with the Prime Minister at Downing . Street. Mr Farmer’s . son George became active in Oxford’s political scene shortly after going . up to St Peter’s College to read theology in 2008. George, . who attended the elite fee-paying St Paul’s School for Boys in London – . Chancellor George Osborne’s old school – was social secretary of the . Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA) in his first year. In . the summer of 2009, the association was embroiled in a bitter public . scandal after candidates for election to its governing committee were . asked at a ‘hustings’ to tell the most racist joke they knew and name . their ‘least favourite minority’. In . response, one of the candidates told a joke about a black person . hanging in a tree. Another said: ‘What do you say when you see a . television moving around in the dark? Put it down you ****** or I’ll . shoot you.’ Unpaid: George, back row, far left, behind former Defence Secretary Dr Liam Fox at the controversial OUCA dinner at London's Cavalry & Guards club . The incident led to the association being banned from using the university’s name for a year. George, who was not present at the hustings when the comments were made, won election as treasurer, taking up his post at the start of the association’s year in the wilderness in October 2009. The scandal had left the group struggling to raise funds, so George turned to his father. Minutes from an association meeting, held that October, quote George as saying that he had ‘talked to an anonymous Tory Party donor who will .  .  . be sending us money’. According to one student present at the meeting, it was made clear that the donor in question was Michael Farmer. The student told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The rules say a treasurer needs to hand over £200 as a condition of taking his post. A few weeks later, George handed over a cheque which was at least ten times that amount. ‘It was made clear where the money had came from. We managed to survive on that for the rest of the year. We all said, “thank God for George’s father.” ’ The racism row was not the only scandal to blight the association during George’s tenure. Christ Church College, Oxford: In February, an investigation by Oxford's academics ended in the club once again being stripped of university status - it is expected to reapply for admission to the university later this year . As social secretary, George had earlier helped to organise a black tie dinner at the Cavalry & Guards club in Pall Mall in June 2009, attended by former Defence Secretary Dr Liam Fox. But the gentleman’s club was furious that a £1,200 debt from the night remained unsettled for more than two and a half years, finally being paid only earlier this year. It was George’s job to collect cheques for the event. In February, an investigation by Oxford’s academics concluded that the ‘financial and administrative officers of the association did not reach the standards required of a recognised student club’ and the association was once again stripped of university status. It is expected to reapply for admission to the university later this year. A third row broke out in June 2010, when a female student was heckled during a debate held by the association. Isabella Burton was told to ‘shush’ because ‘you’re a woman’ by a member of the audience, who then started chanting ‘kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, get back to the kitchen’ and ‘go back to washing the dishes’. George became an active member of the Bullingdon Club, which numbers Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne and London Mayor Boris Johnson as former members, late in his university career, rising to become president during his final term. Famous faces: The OUCA has been a nursery for future Tory stars since it was founded in 1924. Its patron is Baroness Thatcher, left, a former president, and the honorary president is Foreign Secretary William Hague . The Bullingdon has been banned from meeting within 15 miles of Oxford since a notorious dinner in 1927 during which members smashed every window in a college quad. The club maintained its controversial reputation in June 2010, at the end of George’s second year at Oxford, when police were called to the Hartwell House hotel near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, following reports that club members had broken glasses and pulled pipes out of a bathroom. They also investigated claims of criminal damage to a sports car. The event had been booked under a false name – a club tradition – because hotels and restaurants tend to be wary about its riotous reputation. OUCA, which boasts two prime ministers, 13 cabinet ministers and three leaders of the Conservative Party among its alumni, has been a nursery for future Tory stars since it was founded in 1924. Its patron is Baroness Thatcher, a former president, and the honorary president is Foreign Secretary William Hague. Michael Farmer, a devout Christian, who is married with two other children, built his fortune through RK Capital Management, a hedge fund. In November, he and his wife, Jenny, had dinner with Mr Cameron in the Downing Street flat which No 10 described as ‘a social dinner for strong and long-term supporters of the party, with whom the PM has a strong relationship’. He took over as the Tories’ co-treasurer last month. Last night, George Farmer said: ‘My expenditure at Oxford was funded at my discretion, using my allowance and money.’ He did not deny being present at the Hartwell House dinner but stressed he was ‘not involved in any incident’. He added: ‘I was not present at the hustings when racist jokes were made. I was not present at the event in June 2010 where sexist jokes were made. The Cavalry & Guards dinner bill had nothing to do with me due to the fact that I had no access to the accounts and I was not told that the bill had not been paid until November last year, which is when the issue arose. ‘My decision to not run for presidency of OUCA was affected by the repeated incidents of misconduct by the members which I  considered to shed a bad light on an institution that was affiliated with the national party. ‘I absolutely objected to the racist remarks made at the hustings when I became aware of what had been said. Hence my full support for the expulsion of the society members who made the remarks’. A Conservative spokesman declined to comment, but a party source said: ‘George Farmer has clearly behaved entirely appropriately at all times.’","Michael Farmer helped son George meet the high cost of joining the invitation-only, 200-year-old male dining club .

"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho insisted 'there is no racism in football' after apparently rejecting calls for the introduction of the Rooney Rule in the English game. Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Gordon Taylor claims 'there is a hidden racism which holds clubs back' with the appointment of black and ethnic minority managers.

"Desperate: Charles Barry, 48, twice pretended to be a cop to get a Dunkin' Donuts discount . A 48-year-old man accused of twice impersonating a police officer by flashing a fake badge and a holstered handgun . to score discounts at Dunkin' Donuts has been charged. Charles Barry admitted he 'did a stupid thing' when police caught him trying to pass himself off as a United States Marshal at a Trinity, Florida, drive-thru yesterday. Pasco County deputies claim Barry pulled the foolish stunt on November 6 and 7. The first time, the imaging firm salesman displayed a sheriff’s star badge and identified himself as a law enforcement official to the cashier. When the worker refused the discount, Barry allegedly held up a firearm in a holster and said, 'See I am a cop!' The suspicious employee told their manager about the encounter, who then reported Barry to police. When Barry did the same thing the next day, the manager took down Barry's license plate number from surveillance video. ABC 7 reported surveillance was set up at Dunkin' Donuts yesterday and a Pasco Sheriff's Office stopped Barry as he drove away from the outlet. Barry was allegedly carrying a law enforcement badge in his wallet and a .38 caliber revolver in his front pocket. Scroll down for video .

Barry was charged after store employees identified him, deputies said. 'From what I heard, he . was very sorry he did what he did,' New Jersey Captain James Mallo told The Tampa Tribune.

Dunkin’ Donuts worker Michelle Hoeltk told cops that Barry was a regular customer who had been 'abusing his discount . by coming in on the weekends with his family and demanding the . discount,'The Smoking Gun reported.

Barry has been charged with impersonating a law enforcement officer and improper exhibition of a firearm. He was booked into the Pasco County jail, from which he was released last night after posting $5150 bond.

"Exactly where the mutual animosity comes from is a mystery but the friction between Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi was clear for all to see at the Ballon d’Or awards for the best footballer in the world. The body language of both players and their partners as they sat waiting for the result spoke volumes. Scratch a little deeper and it’s clear from both players’ vote in the competition that they could not bring themselves to recognise the other’s remarkable talents. For the record, Ronaldo, who tearfully accepted the top award, voted for Gareth Bale, Mesut Ozil and Radamel Falcao. Messi plumped for Andres Iniesta, Xavi and Neymar.

Yes, we ended up with the right result, but closer analysis of how the votes were cast made the whole thing a bit of a farce and something of an embarrassment to FIFA. The Ballon d’Or is supposed to be a night when rivalries are put to one side to celebrate football at its finest. In concept it is similar to Eurovision, which was designed to help heal the scars of war-torn Fifties Europe in an attempt to celebrate a multi-cultural continent. In Zurich on Monday night, Ronaldo and Messi did at least say the right things. Ronaldo was deserving of his award, remarked Messi, and from the Real Madrid superstar came similar words of respect. But the body language was dreadful, with Ronaldo’s girlfriend Irina turning her back on Messi’s partner Antonella as the couples sat side by side. It was plain rude. Barca bias: Messi voted for Xavi, Neymar and Andres Iniesta (not pictured) for his top three . Both Gareth Bale and Radamel Falcao were among Ronaldo's choices for the world's best player . Body language was dreadful. It was plain rude . The two men really should get on better, given how much they have in common. Both are from impoverished backgrounds — Messi’s father was a steel worker in Argentina, Ronaldo’s a gardener in Madeira — and they have risen to the top not only because of their tremendous talent but because of an incredible work ethic. But they have embraced their success in a different manner. Messi seems more down to earth, often arriving at training in a tracksuit, while Ronaldo often looks as though he has just walked off a Milan catwalk. That said, Messi seemed to be over-compensating at the Ballon d’Or when he opted for a daring, deep red dinner suit in contrast to Ronaldo’s more traditional black tuxedo. Loyal: German captain Philipp Lahm (left) even voted for his Bayern team-mate Franck Ribery (second right) That difference in style fuelled the footballing equivalent of a diplomatic incident last October, when Sepp Blatter told an Oxford University audience that he preferred Messi, praising his modesty. Blatter went on to imply that Ronaldo was far too interested in hair products. The rift between Ronaldo and Messi certainly goes beyond their respective roles as ambassadors for adidas and Nike. When major commercial opportunities have been presented to the two of them, one has been known to reject such offers upon discovering that the other is involved. Perhaps the issue stems from an exchange that allegedly took place at the 2009 ceremony. Messi won the award for the first time and Ronaldo, having emerged triumphant the previous year, whispered to Messi to enjoy his moment because the award would soon be coming back to him. It must, therefore, have wounded him to see the diminutive Argentine beat him to the prize for the following three years. Needs fixing: There was Spanish bias in the team of the year with seven players based there . Retrieved: Ronaldo won the award back in 2008 but on the last four occasions he had to watch Messi take it . Some argue that what animosity does exist is generated not by the players but by those around them. In an attempt to establish his client as the undisputed No 1, Ronaldo’s agent Jorge Mendes even played a part in creating a rival awards ceremony — the Globe Soccer Awards — in 2010. But the childish voting by both players is, let’s be honest, the clearest indication that a problem exists between the two. Ronaldo and Messi were given a vote because they are captains of their national teams — leaders of men and, you would think, above such infantile behaviour. They were not alone. With a clear Real Madrid bias, Iker Casillas went for Ronaldo but ignored Messi. Germany’s Philipp Lahm went for his Bayern Munich colleague Franck Ribery ahead of both of them. Hugo Lloris also went for Ribery, as a fellow Frenchman, and Robin van Persie chose another Dutchman in Arjen Robben. Patriotism: Robin van Persie voted for his Dutch countryman Arjen Robben . Some of the national coaches were no better. Argentina’s man went for Messi, Portugal’s went for Ronaldo and, lo and behold, the France manager went for Ribery. And how did England’s players score? Well, in the best Eurovision tradition, nul points. On Tuesday, Rio Ferdinand lavished praise on both Ronaldo and Messi. ‘I’m still truly astonished by the drive and determination to stay at the top by not only Ronaldo but Messi too,’ he said. ‘It’s been a joy to witness these two push each other week in, week out. 'The question I ask however is: would they be as relentless in scoring so many goals without each other, breaking every record along the way?’ All smiles: Zlatan Ibrahimovic, winner of the goal of the season, posing alongside model Adriana Lima . Ferdinand may have a point. They need each other and the animosity obviously plays its part in that competitive ‘anything-you-can-do’ tussle between two of the greatest players to have graced a football pitch. Football may well be the winner.  Ronaldo and Messi have both brought joy and excitement to all of us. But it might not be the worst idea for FIFA to change the voting process to avoid further embarrassment. ‘Viva Ronaldo,’ declared Ferdinand. Viva la diva, more like.

"Cesc Fabregas faces Arsenal for the first time since leaving the Emirates this weekend as Chelsea host the Gunners at Stamford Bridge. We asked Arsenal fan site Highbury House just what the supporters feel about a former captain and hero lining up for their bitter rivals against them, especially since he's been playing so well. If you wanted a symbol of the divide among Arsenal supporters at the moment then you will find no better example than Cesc Fabregas. There is an on-going debate, both within the Emirates and on the numerous websites devoted to the club, about Arsene Wenger and his continued tenure and Barcelona’s sale of Fabregas to Chelsea has rubbed salt into those wounds. For many of us, Cesc epitomised the great things Wenger achieved over so many years. He was the lingering ember, still smouldering in Barcelona, that so many Arsenal fans believed could re-ignite Wenger's reign and breathe quality back into a central midfield that had become dull. Cesc Fabregas (right) will line up for Jose Mourinho's high-flying Chelsea against Arsenal this weekend . Fabregas has been the driving force behind Chelsea's improved creativity and goal scoring this season . He never spoke badly of the club, even after forcing the move that hurt so many of us. I could see why he wanted to go at the time, though. Barcelona had exerted a strong pull under Pep Guardiola and it was Cesc's homeland. All the rumours about him refusing to play for us in pre-season and feigning injury were disturbing for sure but fans’ forgiveness tends to be in proportion to the player's quality and nobody could dispute Cesc had that in abundance. After the FA Cup success the word was that Wenger would push the boat out in the summer and sign the players that just about everybody in football knew we needed. So, when it became clear that the golden boy was available and Arsenal had a clause in his contract of sale that gave the club the right of first refusal, at a discount price, then what was the problem? Sign him, Arsene. The problem was that our manager didn't see it that way at all. Arsene Wenger played a key role in shaping Fabregas at Arsenal into the talented player you see today . Fabregas became club captain at Arsenal and is pictured here celebrating a goal with Robin van Persie . After several attempts Fabregas finally left Arsenal to return his boyhood club Barcelona in summer 2011 . Now, whether this was for purely footballing reasons in that he didn't want to inhibit the growth of Jack Wilshere and Aaron Ramsey or, as Cesc has said, because of the presence of Mesut Ozil. Or was it a bit of rather ill-judged payback for some shoddy behaviour against the man who had made him the great player he undoubtedly is? But the awful fact of the matter is that Arsenal said no and took a percentage of the transfer fee to, of all clubs, Chelsea. Fabregas is showing the midfield creativity at Chelsea that Arsenal would have benefited from this season . Will Wenger's decision not to resign Fabregas come back to haunt Arsenal at Stamford Bridge this weekend? Those of us who have watched Mourinho's team through gritted teeth this season couldn't have failed to have noticed that he is doing rather well for them. In fact, he puts the opposition under pressure just about every time he gets the ball in their half. Unfortunately for us and in my opinion, Cesc was exactly the player we needed and as Wenger seems to see Ozil as a left-winger I really can't see the sense in not signing him. The sudden drop in Ramsey's form and his subsequent two-month injury, plus the inconsistent nature of Jack's game has made the decision look worse and worse with each passing day. But, not to sign him and at the same time strengthening Sunday¹s opponents, Mourinho¹s Chelsea? Crazy and for some of us, painful too.

"Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino could soon face an unprecedented charge of misconduct from the Football League that may end his troubled stay at Elland Road. And with Cellino bankrolling the Yorkshire club to the tune of £40million, there would be a danger of Leeds going out of business if the Italian is forced out. The League’s board, who met this week, have lost patience with the Cellino camp over the long delay in receiving the written reasons why Cellino was found guilty by a Sardinian court of evading import tax duty on his yacht. Leeds owner Massimo Cellino could be set to face a misconduct charge by the Football League . The view of the FL directors that is Cellino and his representatives are involved in withholding the six-page judgement by Sardinian judge Dr Sandra Lepore that has reportedly been available for over two months. The next step will be to charge Leeds with misconduct if they don’t receive it. Dr Lepore’s findings are reported to say Cellino acted with ‘elusive intent’ in evading the £305,000 duty when his boat The Nelie moored in Cagliari. And that would be enough to deem Cellino to have acted dishonestly, and so fail the League’s owners and directors test. Cellino in the stands with Leeds fans at Brentford's Griffin Park in September . It is understood neither Cellino nor his London lawyers Mishcon de Reya have a copy of the judge’s report. However Cellino’s Italian legal representative Prof Giovanni Cocco has possession of the document. But Cocco has no intention of handing it over to the Football League, who he believes influenced the judgement, and has further complicated matters by lodging an appeal against Lepore’s findings. Meanwhile, fellow crisis club Fulham have had a bid rejected to take Chelsea goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, 42, back on loan.","Massimo Cellino could soon face a misconduct charge .

"The United States named a new Full Admiral in Washington, D.C. Friday--and it's an African American woman. She's will be the first ever female in Naval history to  win a fourth star assuming the Senate approves President Obama's nomination. The Navy announced her nomination in an official release. Vice admiral Michelle Howard,53, is currently the deputy chief of naval operations, plans, and strategy.She will serve as the Navy's second ranking officer, vice chief of naval operations, just a single step below the Navy's top officer, the chief of naval operations. Scroll down for video . Michelle Howard is the first ever female to be awarded 4 stars in the Navy . According to Time.com, more people on her command of ship were more surprised about her race than about her gender. 'For some of the sailors, it was a big deal—not because of the woman thing, but because of the African-American thing,' she told Time. Although when asked about whether she faces racism within the service she responded, 'Sexism within the service, and racism outside the service.' 'Maybe that’s because we started to integrate the officer corps starting at the end of World War II, as far as race was concerned,'she explained. 'I literally had people coming up, wanting to have their picture taken with me—this is the first time this has happened, where a minority woman has had command of a ship,' she continued. 14 years ago when Howard commanded the amphibious dock landing ship USS Rushmore out of San Diego she told Time, 'Someday, sure, they'll be a woman CNO.' President Obama nominated Howard on Friday and she will become a full admiral assuming the Senate approves of the nomination . Ann Dunwoody(left) was awarded 4 starts in the army in 2008 and Janet Wolberger(right) was awarded the highest rank in the Air Force in 2012 . The Army and Air Force were recently awarded high ranking positions as well. Ann Dunwoody was awarded 4 stars from the army in 2008 and Janet Wolfberger was awarded the highest rank from the Air Force in 2012. Howard told Time that making her way to the top was no easy battle. 'Men have the luxury of being average,' Howard said in an interview in 2000. 'When men walk onto a ship, on board they have the luxury of being average. When you walk in as a woman, that assumption does not come with you—you need to prove yourself,'she said. Howard also told of animosity towards her when she first started out. Assignments were kept from her on the sole basis that she was a woman. But over time, treatment toward the extremely dedicated individual changed. People began to see her as an officer, not as just a woman. 'What’s great about the Navy is that despite the few knuckleheads that exist,' she said, 'there are a lot of folks who are professional, and who will grade you on your performance and not on how you look,' she told Time. She recalled working on a warship along with another woman who was second in command.'I was not prepared for the focus on it—'My God, there’s a warship with two women in the top positions—it’s going to sink just from their presence.' It was hilarious,' she said. Michele Howard in 2010 when she was serving as commander of Expeditionary Strike Group 2 . Howard graduated from the Naval academy in 1982 and took command of her first ship the USS Rushmore. She says that American's weren't the only ones surprised. Women in Australia were particularly taken aback to see a black woman taking command of a ship. 'Oh good for you, we need to do this in our country!’they said. `Well, m’am, we don’t see your type around here,’said the Australian men. Howard is always willing to take up a challenge and will have quite a bit of work to do as she pivots to the Pacific during a difficult time for the Navy financially. 'The best ambassador is a warship,' she says. Michelle has had to face 'knuckleheads' in the Navy who didn't think she could do her job but she successfully proved them wrong . Howard has a sense of humor beneath her tough exterior. She told Time that when she was the commander of the Rushmore at 39 one man on board referred to her as 'grandma' on board as oppose to 'old man.' According to a recent demographic report published by the Pentagon, only 14.5% of active-duty military personnel are women. Women represent 13.5% of the Army, 16.4% of the Navy and 19% of the Air Force. Women account for only 6.8% of the Marine Corps, whose highest-ranking woman achieved three stars before retiring earlier in 2013. This is not the first time Michelle Howard has been in the public eye. Back in October Yahoo News did a story on Howard and about how she was challenged in 2009 when she was faced with combatant Somali Pirates in the Arabian Sea when she was commander of the ship the U.S.S Boxer. The ships captain Richard Phillips was taken hostage and it was her job to get him back. Howard spent two days trying to peacefully end the standoff. Finally a team of Navy SEALS shot the pirates on board the lifeboat and brought Captain Phillips back to safety. The story became the 2013 film 'Captain Phillips' starring Tom Hanks. Howard is the true hero behind the scenes.","Michelle Howard is not only female, she is an African American .

"Space experts have warned there is a 'very real danger' associated with a Russian satellite that is due to come crashing back down to earth on Sunday. Portions of the now-defunct Kosmos-1220 satellite will survive the high-speed re-entry to the planet and make a fiery, uncontrolled descent through the Earth's atmosphere, Russian officials have confirmed. Of the utmost concern however is the location where the fragments will land, which remains unknown. 'As of February 7, 2014 the fragments are expected to fall on February 16,' Colonel Alexei Zolotukhin told Russian news agency Ria Novosti. The Kosmos-1220 was launched into by Russia in 1980 and classified as defunct the same year. Russian officials have now warned it will re-enter the earth's atmosphere on Sunday February 16, however officials say they don't know exactly where it will land. This is a stock image . 'The exact impact time and location of the fragments from the Kosmos-1220 satellite may change due to external factors.' The satellite is expected to land somewhere in the Pacific Ocean, which would pose no threat. However according to Fox News, it could potentially fall anywhere on earth. In 1978, a different decommissioned Kosmos satellite crashed into an unoccupied part of Canada, spreading radioactive debris and leading to a lengthy clean-up. Then in 2009, a third Kosmos satellite crashed at over 26,000 miles per hour with a U.S. Iridium telecommunications satellite, sending thousands of bits of space junk into orbit. Most recently the European Space Agency's GOCE satellite managed to harmlessly crash into the ocean in November 2013. The exact size and weight of the Kosmos-1220 satellite is unknown, Ria Novosti reported, adding to the uncertainty of the upcoming event. The GOCE satellite, which was sometimes referred to as the Ferrari of space because of its design, harmlessly crashed into the ocean in November 2013 . 'Much of it will burn up in Earth’s atmosphere, but no doubt fragments of Kosmos-1220 will reach Earth,' David Eicher, editor of Astronomy magazine, told Fox News. 'What we have going for us is that most of the planet is covered with water, and highly populated areas are in the minority of our planet’s surface area. 'So it is unlikely that satellite debris will cause injuries or major damage. Still, with such a reentry, we are playing the odds. 'This is a very real danger, given that a decaying orbit will carry this satellite down onto the planet.' As of October 2013, more than 800 floating bits of space debris posed a potential threat to the International Space Station, according to NASA. Of these, 10 percent were spacecraft, either functional or non-operational, a third were rocket bodies, and the remainder were miscellaneous debris, the Orbital Debris Program Office noted in a recent newsletter.","The Kosmos-1220 was launched by Russia in 1980 and classified as defunct the same year .

"Liverpool forward Fabio Borini believes he could forge a good partnership with fellow Italian Mario Balotelli but admits the variety of strikers at Anfield offers manager Brendan Rodgers plenty of permutations. Balotelli has yet to find his form with just one goal, against Bulgarian minnows Ludogorets, in eight matches and was dropped for last weekend's win over West Brom. Borini, who rejected summer offers to move to Sunderland and QPR, has had even less pitch time with just three appearances, with only one start. Fabio Borini and Mario Balotelli warm up ahead of Liverpool's game away at Basel last month . Balotelli has had a difficult start to his Liverpool career so far with just one goal in eight games . Borini rejected various offers from other Premier League clubs to stay at Anfield in the summer . The 23-year-old has shared the field with Balotelli for just 98 minutes but is confident they could bring out the best in each other. 'I have played with him before and found it really well on the pitch,' he said. 'Not just because of the language but we were born with the same idea of football, as Italians, so it's really easy to understand each other even without talking. 'He's a player that can change the game whenever he wants. It's a tough league, probably the toughest in Europe - and I think he understands that. 'In the games, he runs a lot and is really giving himself to the team, being very unselfish.' With Daniel Sturridge set to return from a six-week absence with a thigh strain when the Premier League campaign resumes next weekend, Borini and Balotelli's replacement against West Brom Rickie Lambert, will find opportunities harder to come by. Daniel Sturridge is set to return to the fold after six weeks out injured . And Rickie Lambert (left) may now find chances even more difficult to come by . However, that does not faze the Italian who thinks Liverpool's quartet of strikers provides essential variety.

'We can all play together and we can all play on our own up front when it is a 4-3-3. 'It is a good selection of strikers and we can all learn from each other. 'I know there are some things that Rickie might do better than me, so I can learn from him. It's the same with Daniel and Mario. 'We all learn from each other if we have the right attitude.

"Nico Rosberg is to switch back to a conservative approach after admitting to an attempt at creativity that failed ahead of this weekend's inaugural Russian Grand Prix. Looking for any edge he can gain over Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton in their battle for this year's Formula One world title, Rosberg tried something different in the second practice session at the Sochi Autodrom. After finishing just 0.065secs quicker than Hamilton at the end of the first run, Rosberg ended the second almost a second down on the 29-year-old Briton. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Nico Rosberg's Russian GP preview . Nico Rosberg finished the first practice session at Sochi 0.065 seconds quicker than Lewis Hamilton . Rosberg struggled in the second practice, and ended almost a second behind British teammate Hamilton . That left Rosberg fourth on the timesheet after the first day of running at F1's newest venue, set in the Olympic Park that was at the heart of the Winter Games earlier this year. Reflecting on his day's work, and a circuit he rates as 'very enjoyable' and 'cool to drive', Rosberg said: 'That was a very productive day from an engineering point of view. 'The team decided to go two different ways in terms of set-up. I took a very creative set-up for my car in the second session, which didn't work out. 'So we will go back to the conservative way for tomorrow, because we saw Lewis was very quick with that.' Rosberg admitted after the practice that he will revert back to a conservative approach for qualifying . Rosberg crosses the finish line during his session practice session ahead of the Russian Grand Prix . Hamilton, who holds a 10-point lead over Rosberg after a run of three successive victories, immediately appeared at home on the track. A happy Hamilton said: 'I like the new circuit. It's got really good grip and great corners, with a lot at medium speed. It's good fun. 'As for the car, that felt really good. We've quite a good balance, so there are a lot of boxes ticked, but we still have work to do to see if we can improve for tomorrow.' As for Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, the only other driver in with a shout of denying Hamilton or Rosberg the title, it was a tough day at the office. The Australian, 73 points behind Hamilton, finished down in 13th, almost 2.5secs off the pace. Worse still was the fact Ricciardo's second session ended seven minutes early as he was forced to pull his car to the side of the track with an engine issue he suspected was looming anyway.

Ricciardo revealed he has not been focused in the wake of Jules Bianchi's accident in Japan on Sunday that has left the Frenchman fighting for his life. 'After what happened in Japan, you try and do the best you can,' added Ricciardo. 'I would be lying if I said other things weren't on my mind, but you do what you can to make sure you're 100 per cent committed to driving and that's the best way for our job and our headspace.

"Luke Shaw will become the world’s most expensive teenager when his £31.5million move to Manchester United is confirmed. Others who have worn the tag include the Brazilian Ronaldo (twice), former Swansea City boss Michael Laudrup and current holder Wayne Rooney, a soon-to-be team-mate of Shaw. Boy wonders: Luke Shaw will top the list of most expensive teenagers when he signs for Manchester United . All smiles: Luke Shaw's £31.5m move to Manchester United will make him the world's most expensive teenager . VIDEO Luke Shaw signs for Manchester United . Be warned, though, for every Ronaldo there is a Caio. Remember him? Caio Ribeiro Decoussau, then 19, signed for Inter Milan from Sao Paulo for £6.6m in 1995 but made just six Serie A appearances for the Nerazzurri. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at the 10 most expensive teenagers in history and determines whether they were a hit, a miss or a maybe. June, 1980: Clive Allen (19) QPR to Arsenal - £1.25m . June, 1983: Michael Laudrup (18) Brondby to Juventus - £1.3m . July, 1991: Dino Baggio (19) Torino to Juventus - £4.4m . July, 1994: Ronaldo (17) Cruzeiro to PSV - £4.8m . July, 1995: Caio (19) Sao Paulo to Inter - £6.6m . July, 1996: Ronaldo (19) PSV to Barcelona - £13m . January, 2001: Antonio Cassano (19) Bari to Roma - £18m . August, 2004: Wayne Rooney (18) Everton to Man Utd - £25.6m . 10) June, 2006: John Obi Mikel (19) Lyn Oslo to Chelsea - £16m . MAYBE – Still splits opinion at Stamford Bridge given the hype amid the prolonged struggle to prise him from the grasp of Manchester United. What you cannot argue with is his return of four FA Cups, a Premier League and Champions League title. 9) May, 2006: Sergio Aguero (18) Independiente to Atletico Madrid - £16.5m . HIT – He enjoyed five goal-laden years with Atletico – bulging the net on 101 occasions – and fired them to Europa League glory in 1010 before a handsome profit was returned on his £38m move to Manchester City. 8) August, 2007: Alex Pato (17) Internacional to Milan - £17m . MISS – The Brazilian’s initial promise ultimately faded and, having returned double figures in three consecutive seasons between 2009 and 2011, injuries perhaps mitigated his decline and he signed for Corinthians in January of last year for £12m. Blue order: John Obi Mikel signed for Chelsea for £16m in 2006 . Unveiling: Sergio Aguero and Atletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo Torres  during his official presentation at the Vicente Calderon . Guard of honour: Alexandre Pato is escored by Italian police ahead of his move to AC Milan . 7) August, 2011: Romelu Lukaku (18) Anderlecht to Chelsea - £17m . MAYBE – West Brom and Everton fans would argue otherwise, but from a Chelsea perspective Lukaku is yet to prove his worth and it remains to be seen whether he will ever get the chance to do so. New boy: Romeulu Lukaku was just 18 when he signed for Chelsea, then under the charge of Andre Vilas-Boas . 6) June, 2001: Antonio Cassano (19) Bari to Roma - £18m . MISS – Five tumultuous seasons – defined by fallouts with every coach, including Fabio Capello – were brought to a close when he signed for Real Madrid for just £4m in 2006. His talent was never in doubt, but as for his temperament… . Trouble ahead: Antonio Cassano was the world's most expensive teenager at £18m when he signed for Roma in 2001 . 5) May, 2007: Anderson (19) Porto to Man Utd - £18m . MISS – Perhaps the most resounding failure to reside on this list is the Brazilian midfielder, who has drifted to near obscurity at Old Trafford and ended last season on loan at Fiorentina. Flop: Sir Alex Ferguson expected more of Anderson when he joined for £18m in 2007 . 4) July, 2005: Sergio Ramos (19) Sevilla to Real Madrid - £21m . HIT – Much was made of his mega-money move to the Bernabeu but Ramos has been worth every cent. He has now made more than 400 appearances for Los Blancos and scored the all-important equaliser in the Champions League final victory over city rivals Atletico in May. Thumbs up: Sergio Ramos has proved a success at Real Madrid . 3) July, 2013: Marquinhos (19) Roma to PSG - £23.5m .

He perhaps peaked with 34 goals in 2012 but he remains a key player and will be hoping the arrival of Louis van Gaal can spark a revival in his fortunes.

"Neil Lennon is the new favourite to land the Bolton job after jumping to the top of chairman Phil Gartside’s shortlist. The former Celtic manager will renew talks with the Championship club on Saturday and looks set to beat off a number of stellar candidates, including Chris Hughton, to the post. Currently propping up the English second tier after winning just one league game this season, Bolton have been looking for a new manager since parting company with Scot Dougie Freedman last month. Neil Lennon is the new favourite to land the vacant manager's job at Championship strugglers Bolton . Lennon has been away from football’s front-line since leaving Celtic in May after a successful four-year spell. He was due to travel to Saudi Arabia this week for talks on the vacant Al-Ittihad post but visa problems meant he and his backroom staff were unable to travel to Jeddah. Whilst a remuneration package of over £2million per year was attractive, Lennon had reservations at moving to the Middle East in any event in terms of his career development. The challenge of firstly securing the Trotters’ place in the Championship before building for promotion is far more appealing and there’s every chance he could take the team for the first time at Birmingham next week. Bolton parted company with Dougie Freedman last month after a dismal run of results in the second tier . His name is also under consideration at fellow Championship strugglers Fulham but with caretaker manager Kit Symons steadying the ship at Craven Cottage, Lennon is more likely to become a rival rather than their would-be saviour. A former Manchester City player, Lennon has maintained his links with the north-west of England and would relish the chance to write the next chapter of his managerial career there. His four years in the Celtic hot-seat brought three successive league titles, two Scottish Cups and qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League.","Neil Lennon left his role as Celtic manager at the end of last season .

"Southampton left-back Luke Shaw will complete a £31.5million transfer to Manchester United in the next 24 hours after being told he will be first-choice left-back. It is understood that he has been . assured that he will start and . 33-year-old Patrice Evra, who will remain with United, is expected to . have a reduced role at Old Trafford. Sportsmail revealed last night that the England international met United officials at the club's training ground, where he was given a personal tour ahead of a medical on Friday morning. It is part of the understanding If all goes as expected, Shaw could be presented as a Manchester United player on Friday afternoon. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luke Shaw show off his free-kick ability in England training . Return: Luke Shaw is back from representing England in his debut at the World Cup in Brazil . Race: Shaw was at Carrington for a medical and is expected to be unveiled on Friday . Move: Southampton left-back Shaw is set to become the most expensive teenager in history . 2012-2014: Southampton (60 apps) 2014-NOW: England (3 caps) He stayed overnight in a Manchester hotel . and will pay a visit to Old Trafford today to be shown around the . club's iconic stadium and for promotional photographs. He will then head . away on holiday before returning to meet his new team-mates for . pre-season. Sportsmail understands that his holidays plans have been . scheduled to ensure that he is back in time for United’s pre-season of . the United States in July. Shaw is understood to have informed Southampton of his desire to leave the club at the end of May and a wage package in excess of £100,000 has been agreed in principle between United and the player for some time. Former: Shaw (right) is set to leave Adam Lallana (left) at Southampton for Manchester United . Green light: Louis van Gaal has given his blessing for the deal to go ahead to bring in Luke Shaw . Former Old Trafford boss David Moyes did some of the groundwork in persuading Shaw to make the move, as United overcame interest from Chelsea to secure their man with a salary that blew the London club out of the water. It is understood that Louis van Gaal has given his blessing for the deal to go ahead. The Dutchman has been in regular contact with executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and he is understood to be delighted with the progress the club have made in the transfer market. United cooled their interest in recent weeks to ensure that Shaw was fully focused on his involvement at the World Cup but as Sportsmail revealed on Monday morning, Ed Woodward intended to accelerate the pursuit once England returned from Brazil on Wednesday afternoon. Shaw disembarked at Luton airport to see his family before heading up to the North-West to become Louis van Gaal's second Manchester United signing, after Ander Herrera completed his transfer to the club on Thursday afternoon. Fee: Shaw's price is somewhat higher than United had hoped for but they are prepared to fork out the sum . Thanks: Shaw throws a boot into the crowd after England drew 0-0 with Costa Rica at the World Cup . Sportsmail also understands that assistant . manager Ryan Giggs has returned from St. Georges Park to welcome Shaw, . where he was undergoing his practical assessment for the Pro License . coaching course on Thursday afternoon. In the absence of Van Gaal and Giggs, Sir Bobby Charlton greeted Herrera at Carrington. The fee for Shaw is somewhat higher than United may have initially hoped for, with Southampton's resistance increasing following Shaw's involvement in the World Cup and the arrival of Dutch manager Ronald Koeman, who has sanctioned the sale. United were initially confident of securing a £27.5 million swoop but Southampton have managed to push the overall fee beyond the £30 million mark. Shaw becomes the most expensive teenager in world football and he is the second most expensive signing in Manchester United's history, behind January recruit Juan Mata, who arrived for a £37 million fee from Chelsea. Shaw and Herrera are yet to be allocated squad numbers by Manchester United and it is believed that the club are waiting to offload a few players before allowing the two new signings to choose.

"A controversial newspaper columnist has been accused of being transphobic after she wrote an article attacking transsexuals as 'bed-wetters in bad wigs' and 'd**** in chicks' clothing'. Julie Burchill wrote a column in the Observer yesterday defending her friend and fellow columnist Suzanne Moore who came under fire on Twitter for an article that said women were under pressure to have bodies like 'Brazilian transsexuals'. The Observer website was swamped with comments in response to Miss Burchill's column, many describing it as 'vile' and 'horrible'. Comments have since been suspended on the story and a message posted on the website says that it is now subject to an 'inquiry' to be carried out by the paper's Readers' Editor. The comment also provoked fury on Twitter. Liberal Democrat minister Lynne Featherstone called for Miss Burchill to be sacked for attacking transsexuals as ‘bed-wetters in bad wigs’. The former Equalities Minister, a staunch supporter of transsexual rights, said she should be fired and her newspaper’s editor John Mulholland should also go. 'Sack her': Former equalities minister Lynne Featherstone, left, has called for Observer columnist Julie Burchill, right, to be sacked after she wrote an article that described transsexuals as 'bed-wetters in bad wigs' Miss Burchill wrote the article in defence of fellow columnist Suzanne Moore, who became the target of transsexuals’ fury over what seemed to be a throw-away comment in a previous article. Miss Moore, describing the challenges faced by modern women in an article for the New Statesman, had written that modern women were expected to look like ‘Brazilian transsexuals’. She had said: '(Women]) are angry with ourselves for not being happier, not being loved properly and not having the ideal body shape – that of a Brazilian transsexual.' The comment provoked fury on Twitter and Miss Moore subsequently said she had been forced to stop using the website because of the abuse she had received. Miss Burchill ranted: 'Though I imagine (Twitter) to be something akin to being savaged by a dead sheep, as Denis Healey had it of Geoffrey Howe, I nevertheless felt indignant that a woman of such style and substance should be driven from her chosen mode of time-wasting by a bunch of d**** in chicks' clothing. She added that the reaction of ‘the very vociferous transsexual lobby and their grim groupies’ reminded her ‘of those wretched inner-city kids who shoot another inner-city kid dead in a fast-food shop for not showing them enough “respect”.’ Under fire: Julie Burchill's column was in defence of friend Suzanne Moore, left, who was criticised for a piece in the New Statesman. Minister Lynne Featherstone has also called for Observer editor John Mulholland, right, to be sacked . Lynne Featherstone, now Minister for International Development, accused Miss Burchill and the Observer of ‘inciting hatred’. She said on Twitter: ‘Julie Burchill rant against transgender community is absolutely disgusting – a bigoted vomit for which the Observer should sack her.’ The Liberal Democrat politician said the editor of the Observer, John Mulholland, should also be sacked. Replying to a message on Twitter saying Mr Mulholland should go, she said: ‘Good point – they both can go!’ She later added: ‘Not illiberal to stand against inciting hatred - evidenced in Ms Burchill’s writing and Observer’s decision to publish.’ Miss Featherstone added: ‘Defending Suzanne Moore is not an excuse. Ms Moore is a brilliant writer - and I hope she is ashamed of Julie Burchill’s rant re trans.’ Miss Burchill’s column also compared the attacks on Suzanne Moore to ‘the Black and White Minstrels telling Usain Bolt how to run’. The row started when Suzanne Moore said in a column that modern women were expected to have bodies like 'Brazilian transsexuals'. Brazilian Cristini Couto is pictured posing after she was elected Miss Transexual International in Madrid . She added: ‘I must say that my only experience of the trans lobby thus far was hearing about the vile way they have persecuted another of my friends, the veteran women’s rights and anti-domestic violence activist Julie Bindel – picketing events where she is speaking about such minor issues as the rape of children and the trafficking of women just because she refuses to accept that their relationship with their phantom limb is the most pressing problem that women – real and imagined – are facing right now.’ Miss Burchill was supported on Twitter by Miss Bindel, who writes for the Observer’s sister paper the Guardian. She said of her article: ‘This has been a long time coming, the bullying has to stop.’ But not all at the Guardian News & Media were so supportive. The Guardian website last night published a retort to Miss Burchill’s column by a transgender rights activist. Entitled ‘Julie Burchill has ended up bullying the trans community’, her article described Miss Burchill’s comments as a ‘list of negative epithets legitimising the currency of hate speech’. She added: ‘The basic point behind everything she says is that trans people lead essentially inauthentic existences and that hers, as a working-class novelist with a taste for lobster and champagne, is real life.’ Readers also took to the Observer website in their hundreds to complain about Ms Burchill's argument. Many readers described it as 'vile', 'shameful' and 'disgusting'. The Observer website version of Ms Burchill's article carried a message that said a number of complaints had been received since its publication. It said that it is subject to 'an inquiry' by the readers editor. The message from the Observer readers editor Stephen Pritchard said: 'As you might imagine, I have received many emails protesting about this piece this morning. 'Thank you to those who have written. I will be looking at this issue and will be replying to all in due course.' A poll of readers on the Independent website following the article saw 90 per cent deem Ms Burchill's article offensive. Ms Burchill, 53, is a self-confessed 'militant feminist'. As well as being a journalist from the age of 17, she is also an acclaimed novelist with her 1989 novel Ambition becoming a bestseller. Her 2004 novel Sugar Rush was adapted for television.","Julie Burchill has come under fire for a column in yesterday's Observer .

"A 37-year-old woman allegedly kept skeleton parts in her flat so she could have sex with them. The Swedish woman is suspected of using 100 parts, which included six skulls and one backbone, in ‘sexual situations’ and was charged with violating the peace of the deceased, prosecutors said.

"The rise and rise of Tyler Blackett continues at pace. The 20-year-old has been at Manchester United since he was seven, but before this season was barely known outside the walls of Carrington. Six games into his season, though, and he could soon find himself on £50,000 a week, having started the campaign on £2,000 - a pay increase of 2,400 per cent. A £50,000 sum may seem the going rate for a centre back starting regularly for United, but has Blackett really justified such a staggering pay rise? Tyler Blackett (right) looks set to be offered £50,000 a week to remain at Old Trafford past this season . The centre back currently earns £2,000 a week and his deal expires at the end of the season . The Manchester United youth product (right) has appeared six times in the league under Louis van Gaal . Swansea (h) lost 2-1 - Sportsmail rating 6 . Sunderland (a) 1-1 - 5 . Burnley (a) 0-0 - 5.5 . QPR (h) won 4-0 - 6.5 . Leicester (a) lost 5-3 - 4.5 . Everton (h) won 2-1 - 7 (came on at 70 mins) Louis van Gaal has spoken glowingly about Blackett and has been impressed by his dedication to improving himself - the defender, as reported previously by Sportsmail, regularly puts in extra training sessions on days off. Yet the fact remains that in the five games Blackett has started this season he has not scored a rating higher than 6.5 from Sportsmail's reporters. His highest rating has been a 7 - but that came in a 20-minute cameo in the 2-1 win over Everton. It must also be remembered that Paul Pogba - now a full French international and one of the best young players in Europe - left Old Trafford when the club balked at his pay demands. Pogba wanted a reported £20,000 a week and when he didn't get it joined Juventus, where he has gone on to win two Serie A titles but is still only on £23,000. Paul Pogba (right) left United after reportedly being refused wages of £20,000 a week and even at Juventus, where he has become one of the most sought-after midfielders in the world, he earns just £23,000 a week . Adnan Januzaj was recently rewarded with a new contract at United but he is paid a reported £30,000 a week . Adnan Januzaj, who so impressed last season and was linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain, is only on a reported £30,000 a week. There will be those that say that no young player - regardless of how good they are - deserves to be lavished with such vast sums. Others will say that, with Blackett's contract due to expire next year, United had to splash out to keep him at the club. Should Blackett go on to become a regular for United for the next decade then £50,000 a week will seem a snip and a masterstroke by the club's hierarchy. But, at present, it seems to be another example of United's apparent willingness to throw money around without concern. Blackett (left) has not received higher than a 7 rating from Sportsmail reporters so far this season . The 20-year-old has featured prominently due to United and Van Gaal's defensive injury crisis this season . By all accounts, Blackett seems to a sensible young man who won't let the money distract him but with his potential sky-high wages now known the pressure will continue to increase on his inexperienced shoulders. Any slip-up and that figure will be bandied about. Blackett is not to blame for this, of course - United's paymasters ultimately sign off any deal and questions must be asked of them. But the centre back will have to attempt to go about his business and prove he is worth the cash, but should such a young man still finding his way in the Premier League be under such intense pressure so soon? Blackett operates as a left-sided centre back and has looked assured despite being just 20 years of age . You can follow them on Twitter here.

"A teenage archaeology student on only his second ever dig unearthed the find of a lifetime when he discovered a 1,800-year-old relic. Undergraduate Alex Kirton, 19, suddenly came across the carved stone head of a possibly Geordie Roman God at the site of an ancient settlement. The stunning artefact, measuring 8in by 4in, is believed to have been dumped as rubbish when a Roman bath house fell out of use and remained hidden until now. Scroll down for video . Lucky find: Undergraduate Alex Kirton, 19, pictured left, discovered the 1,800-year-old relic, pictured right, on his second ever dig at Binchester Roman Fort in Co Durham . Ancient setting: The 1,800-year-old carved stone head of a possible Geordie Roman God that was found by archeologists from Durham University at Binchester Roman Fort . Alex, a first year student at Durham University, was helping to excavate the bath house site at Binchester Roman Fort, near Bishop Auckland, Co Durham, when he made the find. The sandstone head, which dates from the 2nd or 3rd century AD, is likely to represent the war-like Antenociticus, a Celtic god worshipped as a way of inspiring troops about to go into battle. Alex, who is studying Archaeology and Ancient Civilisations, said: ‘I know that I may be an archaeologist for the rest of my life and never find something this significant again, but it’s incredibly exciting to have been the person who uncovered it. ‘My trowel touched something and as I pulled away the soil I realised I was looking at the back of a head. I could clearly to see the impression of the hair carved into it. Excavation site: The first year student was helping to excavate the bath house site, pictured, at the Binchester Roman Fort when he unearthed the find of a lifetime . ‘I knew I may have found something of . interest and I called over my supervisor as I thought I ought to let . someone know what I’d discovered. ‘He came over and between us we carefully cleared away the soil that was surrounding it until all of a sudden the head rolled out face up and was just lying there staring up at us.’ The teenager said he knew his find was a rare one but he realised how special it was when he saw his supervisor’s stunned expression. ‘I was absolutely ecstatic, it seemed such an outrageous piece of luck to come across it on my second dig, but I’m delighted I did,’ he said. The stone head is believed to date back to the 2nd or 3rd Century AD. Dr David Petts, archaeology lecturer at Durham University, said it was probably the head of the Roman God. Dumped: The sandstone headof a Roman God, which measures 8in by 4in, is believed to have been dumped as rubbish when the Roman bath house fell out of use . Exciting find: Lecturer in Archaeology at Durham University Dr David Petts at Binchester Roman Fort, near Bishop Auckland in County Durham, holding the 1,800-year-old carved stone head . He said: ‘Antenociticus is one of a number of Gods known only from the northern frontier, a region which seems to have had a number of its own deities. 'It’s possibly a Geordie god, though it could have been worshipped at the other end of the wall. ‘It’s also an excellent insight into the life and beliefs of the civilians living close to the Roman fort. The style is a combination of classical Roman art and more regional Romano-British traditions. It shows the population of the settlement taking classical artistic traditions and making them their own.’ The find was made as part of a five year project at Binchester Roman Fort which is shedding new light on the twilight years of the Roman Empire. Visitors attending the Binchester Roman Festival on the weekend of July 13/14 will be able to see the head for themselves, along with other objects found during the current excavations. Binchester - known to the Romans as Vinovia - was established in the later 1st century AD and was once the largest Roman fort in County Durham.

Mika Yamamoto, 45, an award-winning journalist, was gunned down last month in the flashpoint city of Aleppo on her first day in the country. Her husband, photographer Kazutaka Sato, who was with her at the time, described how they fled in panic after the soldiers opened fire. Scroll down for video . Kazutaka Sato has told of the horrifying moment his wife Mika Yamamoto was shot dead after they were ambushed by government forces while on assignment in Syria . Mr Sato, 56, said he saw 10 to 15 men walking towards them who he assumed were members of the Free Syrian Army, who had been accompanying them. He told CBS news: 'I held up my camera and started shooting. It was then that it happened. 'I thought I was going to be hit and that's when I was separated from Mika. At no point did I think that she had died. 'I asked a rebel fighter where Mika was. He told me, ""She's at the hospital, go and see for yourself."" 'At that point I pretty much imagined what had happened to her. 'On the first floor of the hospital, in . the lobby to the left on a stretcher, I saw a body wrapped in a sheet. And I knew then it was Mika.' Final moments: Mika Yamamoto is seen at work in Syria on the day she was . killed. Her husband was just metres from her when she was shot .

He spent an hour trying to find her before learning she had been killed . Mika Yamamoto, was an experienced and award-wining reporter, who had worked in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Balkans and Mr Sato spoke of her dedication to the job. He added: 'I think it was her firm belief that you can stop a war with journalism ... she would also turn her attention to children. 'I believe she wanted to tell the world how they are hurt, dead and bruised in their hearts.' Mr Sato said the only way he believes he can come to terms with what happened is to find out exactly what happened. Speaking at a news conference in Tokyo . after he accompanied her body home from Syria he said: 'I suspect the . government side is afraid to see Western journalists, including us, . report facts.' 'What they fear most is a camera,' Grief: Kazutaka Sato breaks down in tears after seeing his wife's body in a Syrian hospital . Mr Sato spoke of his wife's belief in the power of  journalism and how she would often turn her attention to the plight of children caught up in warzones . Earlier in the day, Sato visited the Syrian embassy in Tokyo and handed over a letter requesting a thorough investigation of the case. In the letter, Sato said: 'If your country shoots journalists who report things it finds unfavourable, it is an outrageous act threatening the freedom of the press, which can never be forgiven internationally.' Sato said the Syrian embassy official who received the letter told him the government was not responsible for the well-being of the two journalists because they had entered the country without the proper visas. However, he undertook to pass the letter to Damascus. Yamamoto's . funeral was held in her hometown of Yamanashi, west of Tokyo, last . week. An autopsy revealed she had been shot nine times, including in the . neck where the bullet had fatally damaged her cervical spinal cord. After accompanying his wife's body back to Japan, Mr Sato visited the Syrian embassy in Tokyo and handed over a letter requesting a thorough investigation of the case . Yamamoto is the fourth foreign journalist to have been killed in Syria since March 2011 and the first to have died in Aleppo. She had covered several armed conflicts, including in Afghanistan and Iraq. She became a well-known face on Japanese television after surviving a US tank shelling on the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad in 2003 in which two journalists, one from Reuters and one from a Spanish broadcaster, were killed.

"Wartime diseases such as scurvy and rickets are making a comeback as children eat too much junk food. Pictured are boys enjoying a treat of oranges in 1941 . Wartime diseases are making a comeback among children because their junk food diets are worse than during rationing, warn experts. Conditions such as scurvy and rickets are being fuelled by too many takeaways and microwave meals, it is claimed. But poor nutrition has not stopped many from becoming obese, it is feared, as they are putting on weight from eating the wrong sorts of food. Doctors’ leader Mark Temple said it was a ‘great tragedy’ that some families gain less goodness from their food than those coping with rationing in the Second World War. ‘Food standards are worse now than they were during the rationing during the war,’ he said. ‘That’s a strong indictment on the food industry.’ Latest figures show that  10 per cent of pupils are obese when they start school. The  proportion doubles to almost 20 per cent in those about to start secondary education. Dr Temple, chairman of the  British Medical Association’s  public health medicine committee, said: ‘Obesity is a major health threat and we ought to be doing something about it.’ Sioned Quirke, a member of the British Dietetic Association, warned that relying on fast food was leading to a rise in diseases last commonly seen during the early 20th century. Working in the Rhondda Valleys, South Wales, she has seen rising numbers of childhood illnesses thought to have been eradicated. ‘Rickets and scurvy are coming back,’ she said. ‘When I was training ten years ago, we thought we would not come across them. ‘These conditions are long-term. If the bones are affected by vitamin deficiency, they are affected for life.’ Last year, child health experts said the incidence of rickets  rose four-fold in the last 15 years as young children were not getting enough vitamin D. British children are suffering from wartime diseases because their junk food diets are worse than during rationing, doctors have warned . The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said cases went up from 183 in 1995/96 to 762 in 2011. Cases of scurvy and rickets are on the rise because of a reliance on takeaways and microwave meals by today's junk food generation . Latest figures for 2008 show that 94 children were treated in NHS hospitals for scurvy. However, many health authorities classify it as malnutrition rather than as a separate condition. Miss Quirke said: ‘For some groups, diet and nutrition has reverted to being as poor as it was 100 years ago. ‘The difference between now and then is that this is out of choice. People say fruit and vegetables are not affordable when they are.’ Rickets is caused by a lack of  calcium and vitamin D from foods like oily fish and eggs, making bones soft and malformed. Scurvy can be caused by a lack of vitamin C, which is vital to make collagen. If this protein is not replaced, tissue breaks down, leading to muscle and joint pain. The gums may also bleed and swell.

"Labour leader Ed Miliband used a speech in London to set out why he would not back an EU referendum, unless Brussels tries to seize more powers . Ed Miliband today faced a backlash from within the Labour party after ruling out holding an referendum on Britain leaving the EU. The Labour leader is refusing to match David Cameron’s pledge to hold a . vote by the end of 2017 on whether Britain should stay in the European . Union. In an attempt to appear at least open to the idea of a referendum, Mr Miliband says he would only . hold a vote if the UK decides to hand even more powers to . Europe – something even he admits is ‘unlikely’. But one Labour MP dismissed it as a 'shoddy compromise' while another said the party had to be more 'trusting' of people. Labour donor John Mills said the growth of the EU's influence over Britain in the past 40 years 'warrants a referendum regardless of future events'. But a shadow cabinet source admitted that opposition to a vote was the party's only policy which business liked. It pitches Labour and the Tory party into a bitter battle over who is willing to give the public a say. It was . greeted with delight last night in Downing Street. Speaking at the London Business School, Mr Miliband insisted that a Labour government would not be part of an 'inexorable drive to an ever closer union' in Europe. He said that while he believed it was 'unlikely' that there would be any moves to transfer any more power to Brussels in the next parliament, his new 'legislative lock' would ensure the public would have a say before that could happen. 'Now, there are no current proposals from other countries for such a transfer of powers. 'And I do not believe this is the direction in which Europe should head. Indeed, I think some powers should come back the other way. But we cannot be certain about the emerging shape of Europe,' he said. But Mr Cameron dismissed the new policy as a fudge cooked up by a committee trying to please a range of conflicting views inside the Labour party. Speaking to reporters on a trip to Israel, the Prime Minister said the Labour leader's intervention meant the Conservatives will be the only mainstream party guaranteeing a referendum on Europe, both at May's European Parliament elections and the General Election next year. Mr Cameron said: 'This is a policy clearly designed by a committee - a committee who obviously couldn't decide what to do, who have come up with a policy that makes no sense whatsoever. 'The British people now have a very, very clear choice - at the next election they can elect a Conservative government that will renegotiate Britain's position in Europe and give people a guaranteed In/Out referendum by the end of 2017. 'If they get a Labour government they will get no referendum, no choice, no reform - nothing. 'It's absolutely clear - you get Miliband, you don't get a referendum, you don't get a choice. It's the classic Labour ""we know best"" approach to politics.' Mr Miliband was criticised by some Labour MPs for the fudge in response to the Tory pledge of a referendum by 2017 . The Labour told the London Business School that threatening Britain's membership of the European Union risked causing damage to the economy . Mr . Miliband’s move will exasperate senior figures in his own party, who . have been pressing him to match the Prime Minister’s pledge. But after shadow chancellor Ed Balls announced a fresh tax raid on pensions, bankers and houses to fund a youth jobs scheme, it is hoped that ruling out an EU referendum will help bolster Labour's support among business leaders. One shadow cabinet minister told MailOnline: ‘Opposing a referendum is our only policy which businesses like. Rightly or wrongly – and it is unfair – there is the impression that we are anti-business. 'Why would we give up the only thing which marks us out from the Tories which business like?’ Mr Miliband has launched a series of attacks on big business including energy firms, pensions companies and banking. Today it emerged shadow employment minister Stephen Timms had launched a scathing attack on capitalism. He claimed businesses were 'driven by greed' and that unethical business practices were 'the natural way that capitalism operates', The Times reported. But the decision was greeted with . dismay by some in the party. Labour donor John Mills, who gave the party . £1.5million last year, said: 'The growth of the EU's influence over . Britain warrants a referendum regardless of future events.' Labour backbencher Graham Stringer said: 'I think it's a shoddy compromise really, between those people in the Parliamentary Labour Party who want a referendum because the vast majority of the electorate want it, and those people desperate not to have a referendum. 'I think the public are very clear that they want a referendum. This is so ambiguous as to be impossible to sell on the doorstep.' Labour . MP John Mann said he still hoped Mr Miliband would go further and . commit to an in-out referendum even if no power transfer is on the . table. 'Certainly I've . polled very (extensively) Labour votes in my area, and without question, . they're more hostile than they were to the European Union - . significantly more so - and I think that we need to be in touch and we . need to be trusting the people,' he told BBC Radio 4's World Tonight. 'So . I hope that over the next few months he'll go further and say that the . Labour Party's going to trust the people and let the people have a say . on this.' One Labour frontbencher said Mr Miliband had ruled out a referendum as the only policy which business supported . However, business leaders have warned the prospect of an EU referendum would cause unnecessary uncertainty and threaten the economy. The CBI argues it 'is in our shared interests for the UK to stay in the EU'. In response to Mr Miliband's announcement, by Sir Martin Sorrell, head of advertising and media giant WPP, said: 'I would say not having a referendum is better than having one. Having a referendum creates more uncertainty. The last thing we need is more uncertainty.' Mr Cameron used a speech in January last year to promise to claw back powers from Brussels before holding an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. Labour dithered for months about whether to match the pledge, with Mr Balls and international development spokesman Jim Murphy among those urging Mr Miliband to include the promise of a referendum in the 2015 manifesto. Ex-Business Secretary Lord Mandelson said Mr Miliband was showing 'strong leadership' by ruling out a popular policy . But writing . in the Financial Times, Mr Miliband says: ‘My priorities for government . after the election are very different from the Conservatives. 'Labour . will focus on dealing with the cost-of-living crisis by building a . better economy so people can look forward to a better future for their . children. ‘An arbitrary . timetable for a referendum on leaving Europe would damage our ability to . deliver on these priorities.’ He adds: ‘The next Labour government will . legislate for a new lock: there would be no transfer of powers from the . UK to the EU without a referendum on our continued membership of the . EU.’ Mr Miliband's decision is also a blow to Ukip, whose leader Nigel Farage had repeatedly . insisted Mr Miliband would be forced to buckle and agree to a . referendum. The Labour leader stressed his determination to reform the EU if elected in 2015, and pledged a legal lock that would guarantee an in-out vote if Westminster was asked to hand over more control. The legal lock proposed by Mr Miliband would effectively upgrade the one introduced by the coalition which guarantees a referendum before any powers are transferred. Labour's position aligns it closely with the Liberal Democrats on Europe, offering common ground for any potential negotiations about forming a joint government in 2015. Posting on Twitter last night, Mr Cameron said: 'By his own admission, Ed Miliband says it's unlikely there'll be an in-out referendum on Europe under Labour. 'Only the Conservative Party can guarantee and deliver that referendum.' Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a visit to Jerusalem today, said only the Tories would offer a vote . Mr Cameron could not contain is delight at Labour's decision to rule out matching his pledge on holding an in-out referendum . A . Conservative spokesman added: ‘Our relationship with Europe isn’t . working and it needs to change. That’s why David Cameron has set out a . plan to seek a new settlement for Britain in Europe, and then put it to . the British people in an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. ‘Both . Labour and the Liberal Democrats oppose this plan – they won’t give the . people a referendum and Ukip simply cannot deliver one. Only the . Conservatives will trust the British people to have their say on our . country’s future.’ Former Labour Business Secretary Lord Mandelson hailed Mr Miliband's decision as an example of strong leadership. He told BBC Radio 4: 'Most people in the first instance will say that a referendum has looked quite popular amongst many in the public and therefore he’s doing something which shows strong leadership in standing up against that position. 'But even those who disagree with him generally on matters, on a referendum in particular, I think they will admire him for showing leadership and guts on a major issue. 'Therefore this is a test of him and his approach to leadership as much as to the issue itself, and for those who are worried about Britain just sleepwalking out of Europe, not only those who are running businesses and depending on Europe’s vast market, MIliband’s statement will be particularly important and welcome. But his comments indicated a dramatic change of heart, having argued in 2010: 'I believe a fresh referendum will be necessary because the political parties cannot reconcile their own differences and come to a final conclusion on their own, and nor should they.'","Ed Miliband said only if UK forced to hand more powers to Brussels .

"Spirituality typically promotes ideas of peace, bliss, and inner calm. But a new study claims that people who have spiritual and religious views are more likely to become aggressive and violent when drunk, compared to people without such beliefs. A U.S. psychologist also claimed that in many cases, the stronger the person's views, the more hostile and aggressive they are when drinking. A U.S. psychologist claims that in many cases, religious people are more aggressive than people without strong spiritual beliefs when they are drunk. A stock image of an aggressive conversation is pictured . The study found that violence decreased as spirituality increased in people who didn’t drink alcohol. A stock image of a woman praying is shown . The correlation was discovered by Professor Peter Giancola of University of Kentucky College of Arts and Sciences. He said: ‘Oversimplifying - in many cases the more religious someone is, the more aggressive they will become after drinking alcohol.’ The researcher and his former graduate student, Aaron Duke, defined a spiritual person as someone who ‘finds meaning in the sacred,’ regardless of the doctrine they follow. Professor Giancola said he was originally trying to create a profile of risk factors to predict alcohol-related violence. He examined 520 people aged between 21 and 35 years old from the central Kentucky region. Participants in the study were randomly given an alcoholic or non-alcoholic drink, after being quizzed on the degree of their spiritual beliefs. Professor Giancola found that violence decreased as spirituality increased in people who didn’t drink alcohol. But, he said he was surprised to discover that violence increased as spirituality increased in people who drank alcohol. He continued that the study indicated alcohol ‘releases the beast within’ in highly religious people, although the reasons for this are unknown. However, the psychologist also pointed out that his findings are preliminary and require further work to verify and explain them. People who regularly visit a place of worship are less likely to get involved in low level crime and delinquency, according to researchers. A survey from Manchester University in January, found a direct correlation between higher visits to religious places and lower crime figures, especially in relation to shoplifting, drug use and music piracy. Researchers believe this is because religion not only teaches people about 'moral and behavioural norms', but also spending time with like-minded people makes it less likely they'll get mixed up with the 'wrong crowd'. As part of the project, more than 1,200 18 to 34-year-olds from across all the UK's major faiths were asked about their worshipping habits. They were also asked about any past misdemeanours, and the likelihood they would commit low-level crimes in the future. In total, researchers asked respondents about eight varying types of delinquency including littering, skipping school or work, using illegal drugs, fare dodging, shoplifting, music piracy, property damage and violence against the person. Although the study found varying degrees of correlation between increased church visits and decreased crime rates, the most significant were seen in relation to shoplifting, the use of illegal drugs and music piracy.","Kentucky psychologist has found a correlation between religion and alcohol .

"A young Florida mother has been arrested for allegedly refusing to take her dehydrated newborn to a hospital citing her strong vegan beliefs. Sarah Anne Markham, 23, of Casselberry, was arrested Tuesday and charged with child neglect after police say she disregarded her pediatrician’s directive to have her baby hospitalized. The doctor told the mother that the newborn was suffering from dehydration and losing weight, according to police. New-age mom: Sarah Anne Markham, 23, of Florida, was charged with child neglect after police say she disregarded her pediatrician's directive to have her dehydrated baby hospitalized citing her strong vegan beliefs . But instead of heading to Florida Hospital South for treatment as instructed, Ms Markham took her baby home. When police officers came knocking on her door, they say the 23-year-old refused to open up, forcing them to bring in a locksmith and break into her apartment. When interviewed by police, the 23-year-old woman declared that she wanted to get a second opinion on her child’s condition from a 'vegan' doctor and was interested in a holistic treatment. Markham also claimed her baby could not be dehydrated because the infant was still having bowel movements. According to investigators, Sarah Markham admitted that she did not give the formula provided to her by her child's doctor because she believed the ingredients came from animals, and instead she bought an organic soy formula, the local station Click Orlando reported. When asked if her doctor had confirmed that the plant-based formula was appropriate for her baby, Ms Markham allegedly replied that she knew it was safe because it came from a Whole Foods Market. 'Recipe for disaster': Markham said that she did not give the formula provided to her by her child's doctor because she believed it contained animal parts, and instead she bought an organic soy formula . The 23-year-old eventually relented, telling officers that she will take her baby to the hospital because she was being forced to do so. But she stayed home for the next hour, prompting officers to place her under arrest just after 7pm. The police report stated that on her way to jail, the young mother seemed unperturbed by what was happening, even after she was informed that she will not be able to see her baby until she goes before a judge. Markham's infant has been taken to a hospital for treatment and later placed into state custody.

"Under fire: Cllr Paul Whittle is facing calls to step down after missing almost half the meetings at Fareham Borough Council working Saudi Arabia . A leading Liberal Democrat councillor is facing calls to step down after taking a £180,000-a-year job in Saudi Arabia - 4,000 miles from his ward in Hampshire. Cllr Paul Whittle has kept his £13,000 allowance from Fareham Borough Council, Hampshire, despite working full-time as director of contracts for the Colleges of Excellence in the city of Riyadh. He has missed six of his 14 committee meetings since assuming the role in February. Now, voters and colleagues are further enraged after he failed to show at the Local Government Association conference - which costs the council £500 per person. The council's Tory leader Sean Woodward said he should step down, adding: 'Perhaps he should spend more time in his ward Fareham East, than in the Middle East.' The TaxPayers' Alliance also has concerns that taxpayers' money was wasted on the conference - describing it as a 'costly no-show'. Andy Silvester, of The TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'This costly no-show will only add to suspicions that Cllr Whittle can't balance the responsibilities of a local representative with a job on the other side of the world. 'He should pay back the ticket out of his own pocket - paying it out of his allowances is just shuffling taxpayers' money around, rather than refunding them.' Cllr Whittle, who has also failed to attend any meetings of the smaller committees he sits on since he began juggling both roles, has taken to sending representatives to his engagements in Hampshire. The business expert, who also works part-time as a magistrate in Britain, claims his full-time job in Saudi Arabia is flexible and that he could be contacted via email and phone. The company he now works for, a collection of 37 colleges across Saudi Arabia, bills itself as a leading trainer in technical and vocational business skills. It holds courses in leadership, how to trade internationally, and how to make it in business across the world - from Germany to Japan. Brokering deals for the leading training school 4,000 miles from home, Cllr Whittle's colleagues complain that he is in no position to hold the opposition to account. The council's deputy Tory leader Trevor Cartwright said there was a difference between working full-time locally and commuting to Saudi Arabia. Cllr Cartwright said he worked for ten years in Portsmouth while a councillor, so he appreciates the difficulties of juggling responsibilities. He said: 'You can either be in your ward or working abroad, you cannot do both.' Ukip's Chris Wood added: 'Someone working in Saudi Arabia will find it difficult to hold the Conservative administration to account.' Riyadh is the capital and largest city of Saudi Arabia. It is home to 5,254,560 people. The city is divided into 15 municipal districts headed up by the mayor and the governor. It has the largest all-female university in the world. In 1950, King Saud ordered for Riyadh to be remodelled in the style of American cities, with grid-like layouts. It is a cultural and shopping metropolis, with a 'Kingdom Center' to shop in. It is host to four major football clubs and often hosts major FIFA tournaments. With a number of highways, people travel by chauffeur-driven car or taxi. Fareham is a market town at the north-west tip of Portsmouth harbour. It is home to 97,504 people. The city is known for manufacturing bricks and growing strawberries. Current employment includes retail, which a few dozen shops, and small-scale manufacturing. It has a non-league football club, Fareham Town FC. It is served by road and rail networks, with the M27 nearby. Places of interest include Portchester Castle, Britain's second-oldest man-made waterway, and the last-surviving VIctorian steam-powered brickworks. Cllr Whittle is offering to pay back the ticket cost from his  councillor allowances and denies he should step down. He said: 'I always attend council meetings to fulfil my duties to my residents and the council. 'I am one of the few who work, I get a little bit irritated when you say 'how can you be a councillor and work?' 'If somebody can prove that I would not be able to represent residents then they would have a point. 'Nobody could suggest that I do not work hard and do my job. 'I like to deal with people face-to-face and I will be at as many meetings as I can manage.' Ward colleague and fellow Liberal Democrat Katrina Trott was quick to defend him. She said: 'He's standing up for his residents. 'The Tories are stirring up trouble and would like to have him gone and he is an effective opposition leader. Outrage: Fareham Borough councillors claim he cannot hold the opposition to account from Saudi Arabia . 'We have every confidence in him as leader.' The Local Government Association's annual conference is the biggest event in the local government calendar. Cllr Whittle missed the event, held in Bournemouth, Dorset, on July 7 and 8, at a cost of more than 500 pounds a ticket. Traditionally, Fareham's council leader, opposition leader and chief executive attend the event every year. Cllr Whittle claims he told officers a week before that he could not attend, something the council denies. A council spokesman said: 'At no point were we informed that Cllr Whittle would not be attending the event.' Constituents in Fareham East have expressed their views on their globe-trotting representative, doubting his capabilities to juggle both roles. Neil Slatcher, 35, said: 'I don't think he will commute, I think he will be over there more than he will be over here.' Vernon Ross, 86, added: 'I don't think he can do his job properly, how can he? 'I don't think you should be the leader of the Lib Dems and be out in Saudi Arabia.'","Cllr Paul Whittle is director of contracts at Colleges of Excellence in Saudi .

"Drinkers who get their friends to perform dangerous NekNomination stunts could be charged with manslaughter if they die, lawyers said today. The warning was issued after Bradley Eames, 20, apparently became the third British victim of the deadly crazy after filming himself downing nearly two pints of gin. The salesman, from Nottingham, was found dead in his home four days after filming the stunt. Police are understood to have watched the video as they investigate the tragedy. Drink challenge: Bradley Eames, 20, is thought to have become the third British NekNominate victim. He died after downing two pints of gin. The footage was posted online . First victims: Stephen Brooks, 29, (left) who died after downing a pint of vodka and Isaac Richardson, 20, (right) who was the first person to die in Britain after taking part in a NekNominate challenge . Latest victim: Bradley Eames, 20, who is thought to have become the third person to die as a result of taking part in a NekNominate challenge . The death is potentially the third in the UK linked to the viral game which involves players filming themselves downing drinks and posting the videos online, daring others to outdo them. The death of Mr Eames happened after Stephen Brookes, 29, and Isaac Richardson, 20, died after completing similar NekNomination challenges. Lawyer Julian Young said that anyone who NekNominated in future could could find themselves hauled before a court - even  if the dangerous stunt didn't end in tragedy. He said that if someone died and the person who urged them to do the dare could face a manslaughter charge. Mr Young said: 'Any person would have to prove that the person who did the nomination knew with a degree of certainty what was likely to occur. NekNominate challenge: Bradley Eames, 20, appears to struggle as he downs two pints of gin. He is thought to have become the third British NekNominate victim . Determined: He throws back the remaining alcohol to complete his dare . Thumbs up: Bradley attempts to show he is fine after the dare, but just hours later he would complain of feeling unwell . 'At the beginning of this no-one knew what was going to happen.' But he said that there is now a 'good argument' that people would have been able to predict a tragic outcome. Mr Young said: 'If a person knew, because of all the publicity, and said, ""I have been watching it on the news, I nominated my mate and thought he would be all right but knew there was a risk"" you could have grounds for a prosecution. It might be manslaughter. 'There is a possibility, if someone knew what the outcome could be, that it could cause death, there could be a prosecution.' The solicitor, of Julian Young and Co, in London, warned that someone could still face lesser charges of causing actual or grievous bodily harm even if there was no death. Mr Young added: 'If they harm animals, like swallowing a goldfish, there could be a case for causing unnecessary suffering.' play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . A former grammar schoolboy was the first British victim of the dangerous NekNominate craze. Isaac Richardson, 20, was dared to drink something 'messed up' in an effort to outdo other challengers. He downed a cocktail that consisted of wine, whisky, vodka and lager in Woolwich, south-east London, before collapsing. Efforts were made to resuscitate the young man who was staying at a hostel above O'Connors pub where he had been drinking. However, he died in the early hours of February 9. The death is not been treated as suspicious and an inquest has been opened. A 29-year-old man became the second victim of NekNominations after he downed a pint of vodka. Stephen Brookes, from Cardiff, was found dead in his bed after having the deadly drink. He was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead in the early hours of February 9. Friends posted footage of him carrying out his challenge on Saturday but removed it after he became ill and died. His mother Paula said: 'He went home at about 2am and my daughter-in-law rang me to say he wasn't well and I needed to come over. 'When I got there the paramedics were doing everything they could but he didn't respond. He died in his sleep.' Dr Phil White, secretary of North Wales Local Medical Committee, said a criminal prosecution would halt the NekNominate craze. The NekNominate craze is thought to have originated in Perth, Australia, but thanks to social media it has since gone global. The hashtag 'neknominate' started trending in the UK in January 2013 and has since been growing in popularity around the world. The concept of the game has been described by a user on Facebook as: 'Neck your drink. Nominate another. Don't break the chain, don't be a d**k. The social drinking game for social media! #neknominate. Drink Responsible'. The stunt is filmed then posted on the internet. One popular video shows a bare-chested man emptying a bottle of beer down the toilet before two friends lower him head-first into the porcelain bowl to lap it up. Another extreme example featured a woman riding a horse into a supermarket and  downing a can of Pepsi. However, the trend has taken a dark trend in recent weeks as reports have begun to emerge of young men dying after drinking huge amounts of alcohol for a dare. 'If . there were a prosecution, that would be it,' he said. 'It would stop . overnight because everything is recorded on the internet. You can tell . who has challenged someone to do what because it is there in the ether.' Dr . White worried it was just a matter of time until a woman died as well - . even though fewer of them appear to have been involved in Neknominate. He warned: 'Drinking games are dangerous. People die from them. I see people dropping dead all the time after a binge. 'Neknominating . just seems to be challenging people to do stupid things. But if you are . not used to drinking it does not take much to poison you.' Mr Eames, from Sneinton, Nottingham, filmed himself on February 6, downing two glasses of Gordon’s gin – not quite filled to the top – mixed with teabags. It is estimated he drank almost 30 shots of the strong alcohol in the two-minute video, before challenging friends to outdo him. Speaking to the camera, he said: ‘I’ve been watching you guys do the Neknominate but to me I don’t think they’re good so I bought myself some gin and this is how you drink.’ In the video, which is no longer online, he poured himself one pint  and drank it – stopping halfway through to gag. Mr Eames finished the drink before immediately pouring another while his hands violently shook. He quickly drank that. He then turned to the camera, did a thumbs-up sign and said: ‘Have fun.’","Bradley Eames, 20, 'became the third NekNominate victim' after downing nearly two pints of gin .

"Susanna Reid will be holidaying in the UK for the next fortnight after being caught in passport backlog . Breakfast presenter Susanna Reid’s plans for a family holiday abroad have been halted after she was caught up in the passport backlog and forced to take a ‘staycation’. The Good Morning Britain host had been putting off filling out the application for one of her sons after reporting on the issues at the Home Office on the show. Ms Reid, 43, was due to jet off today but despite posting the form on July 9, she is still without a passport and is now opting for a holiday in the UK with sons Sam, Finn and Jack. The process typically takes three weeks but the under-staffed department has struggled to deal with the surge in applications and some travellers have faced a two-month wait. Her son’s document is now thought to be one of about 350,000 being processed by the Home Office. The presenter told the Mirror that she reported on the backlog in June and was well aware of the problem, blaming herself for not posting the application in time. ‘We were inundated with comments by viewers – both those experiencing the backlog and others asking, ‘Who are these people that leave their passports till the last minute?’ Well, I’m one of them,’ she said. ‘So there I was reporting on the story and in the back of my mind thinking, ‘One of my boys needs his passport renewing’. For some reason, like other busy mums, I kept putting it off. I kept thinking, ‘It’s such a palaver’ – you need to get the photos done, the form and the counter-signature.’ The former BBC Breakfast star, who had booked the two weeks off work, admitted she still had hopes the family could travel abroad as late as today but now realises that won’t be a possibility. The family did not want to risk the disappointment and so had not booked a holiday beforehand. Ms Reid is now hoping to make the most of the British weather and take a ‘staycation’, although she has not revealed where in the UK she will be holidaying. She said: ‘We’ve been so lucky with the weather. There couldn’t have been a better time to get it wrong.’ Scroll down for video . Tens of thousands of applications wait to be processed at the Liverpool passport office, one of seven around the country. The picture was taken by a disillusioned staff member . Emergency measures were brought in to deal with an ‘exceptional period of demand’ in passports after thousands encountered longer than expected delays. This included increased staffing and free of charge fast-tracking applications of people with an urgent need to travel abroad. HM Passport Office chief executive Paul Pugh said that the 775,000 applications received in June 'I think is the highest ever recorded in a single month'. But the Home Office announced last Sunday that the number of passports being processed in the week ending June 22 was down to 360,000. The Home Secretary, Theresa May, has apologised to those affected by the backlog. On Good Morning Britain with her co-hosts where she reported on the passport backlog in June. She will return to the programme after her two week break on on Monday, August 11 . Applications for passports surged unexpectedly this year and the Passport Office says it has been dealing with its highest demand in 12 years. The under-staffed department was under pressure to deal with over half a million applications from people hopeful to go on holiday this summer. Thousands upgraded to the £128 premium fast-track four-hour service, fearing their passports would not arrive in time. Extra staff were drafted in, with some working seven days a week to clear the backlog of 30,000 passports, and raking in almost £1million in overtime pay. Standard passports cost £72.50 - or £46 for children - and should only take three weeks to get, but some holidaymakers reported waiting two months to get their documents back. David Cameron blamed the application surge on the fact the economy has picked and more people have planned foreign holidays. The Home Office said last Sunday that the number of passports being processed was 360,000, which was down from its peak of 508,000 in the week ending June 22. More than four million passports have been issued so far in 2014.","Ms Reid, 43, was hoping to jet off today but had put off posting son's form .

"St Helens coach Nathan Brown has dropped a bombshell by announcing his decision to return to Australia, less than 24 hours after guiding the Saints to the Super League Grand Final. Brown, who is coming to the end of his second season at Langtree Park, has been released from the final year of his contract for family reasons. St Helens chairman Eamonn McManus said: 'Nathan received our blessing to apply for the Wests Tigers head coaching position and, although not successful, the same family reasons for a return home still pertained. We, therefore, willingly agreed to grant him an early release regardless.' St Helens coach Nathan Brown has stunned the club by resigning for family reasons . The timing of the announcement is extraordinary, coming in the wake of St Helens' 30-12 win over Catalan Dragons that secured a first trip to Old Trafford since 2011. Brown was absent from the post-match press conference, sending instead his assistant Keiron Cunningham, who is sure to be considered as his successor. Saints say they will announce the appointment of a new head coach 'at an appropriate time during the close season'. Brown will return to Australia and the decision comes just a day after St Helens reached the Super League Grand Final . Brown, 41, who has a wife and four young children, enjoyed success in a three-and-a-half year stint at Huddersfield from 2008 before succeeding fellow Australian Royce Simmons at St Helens following a spell as caretaker-coach by then general manager Mike Rush in November 2012. The former St George player and coach had been linked with virtually every vacancy that has arisen in the NRL and was interviewed by Wests Tigers before losing out to Jason Taylor. McManus added: 'Nathan has done a great job in rebuilding the St Helens squad over the last two seasons and we are very strongly positioned indeed for the future. Adam Swift dives over to score one of St Helens' five tries in their 30-12 win against Catalan Dragons . 'The club's focus is now entirely on winning the Grand Final at Old Trafford next week. 'We are confident and the team is looking forward to this game with absolute determination and focus. As it is Nathan's last game in charge, there is even more to play for and the motivation levels are even higher.' St Helens say they will not be making any further statement at this time.","St Helens coach Nathan Brown will leave the club and return to  Australia after next week's Super League Grand Final .

"Appearance: Roy Harper, 72, leaves Hereford Magistrates' Court today with an unidentified woman . Veteran folk and rock performer Roy Harper has appeared in court charged with committing a series of child sex offences in the 1970s. The singer-songwriter, who has performed with Pink Floyd and influenced rock band Led Zeppelin, was not required to enter a plea to any of the charges during a four-minute appearance at Hereford Magistrates' Court this morning. Harper, 72, who lives in the Republic of Ireland, is accused of two counts of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl aged under 13. The singer, of Rossmore, near Clonakilty, County Cork, also faces three charges of indecent assault and four of gross indecency relating to the same alleged victim. West Mercia Police announced last week that Harper had been charged with the offences, which are alleged to have occurred between 1975 and 1977 in the Herefordshire area. Harper, dressed in a checked shirt and blue jeans, spoke only to give the clerk of the court his name and full address during the hearing. He declined to comment to reporters after his appearance before three magistrates, who granted unconditional bail and ordered him to appear before a judge at Worcester Crown Court on December 2. The prolific performer has produced more than 30 albums during his career. Veteran folk musician: Prolific performer Roy Harper has produced more than 30 albums during his career .

"At 24 years old, Republican candidate Jordan Haskins is facing an uphill battle to win a seat in Michigan state House long held by Democrats, but his young age and party affiliation are the least of his problems. The baby-faced aspiring politician is currently on parole after serving prison time for a series of bizarre, sexually motivated break-ins he had committed in Saginaw - the same area he now seeks to represent in the state House. Haskins' criminal record includes trespassing on private and public property in four cases from April 2010 to January 2011, when he was sent to prison. As part of the break-ins, he damaged vehicles as a way to enable what he told police was a sexual fetish. What a difference: Jordan Haskins pictured left before he began serving a one-year term in Michigan's state prison in October 2011, and right this past April speaking against an LGBT nondiscrimination ordinance . His highly unusual proclivities had earned Haskins two misdemeanor charges of unlawful use of a motor vehicle and destruction of property after the Saginaw man broke into a state parking lot, pulled spark plugs and wires out of police cruises and pleasured himself while cranking the engine. Following his arrest in 2011, Haskins told investigators that he picked up the habit online. Asked by The Saginaw News what drove him to commit these offenses, the 24-year-old Republican replied: 'I was in a messed-up state of mind mentally and emotionally when I did what I did. That's the only way I can even explain it.' Haskins also reportedly enjoyed gratifying himself sexually inside stolen cop cars, trucks and once in a mosquito control car. But the fresh-faced political candidate who seeks to represent the 95th State District insisted that he has turned a new leaf and has gone past the dark phase in his life when he was 'young and stupid.' Conservative ex-con: Haskins, 25, is running as the sole Republican for 95th District House seat three years after landing behind bars for breaking into and masturbating inside city police cars and trucks . ‘I feel that, yes, I’ve made mistakes in my past. But I’m working to correct those things and to try at least to put in my small part and help others in my community and try to make things right,’ said Haskins. On his Facebook page, Haskins described himself as a 'pro-life, pro-family and freedom loving American.' Jordan Haskins' criminal history dates back to the time when he was arrested for a break-in at age 15 in North Carolina. He spent the next six years going in and out of correctional facilities for trespassing and larceny. Looking back on his desolate youth, Haskins said he was a lonely, angry and bored kid in search of an adrenalin rush who belonged on the 'world's dumbest criminals' list. After moving to Michigan in 2009, Haskins continued his petty-crime spree, which earned him a slew of misdemeanor charges for breaking into state vehicles, pulling out spark plug wires and masturbating to the sound of the running motor. In 2010, Haskins was sent to jail for 55 days and one-year probation, but ran afoul of the law just a few months after his release for joyriding and masturbating in police cruises and a city-owned pickup trucks. In September 2011, Haskins pleaded no contest to multiple counts of breaking and entering, unlawful driving and malicious destruction of property, and was sentenced to one year and eight months in prison. Comeback kid: Haskins, pictured here in March putting up signs endorsing Bill Schuette for Attorney General, said he turned a new leaf while serving a year in prison and wants voters to give him a chance . In retrospect, the aspiring state house representative has blamed his transgressions on his troubled family situation, having being raised without a father by his mother and grandmother. Haskins said doing time in prison was his ultimate wake-up call – and also a call to action. ‘I've realized that my gift that I have is in government and politics,’ he said. ‘I've found my niche, my passion.’ Haskins' parole will run out October 23 - just 11 days before Election Day. He hopes that voters will recognize that he has been working hard to correct his mistakes and give him a second chance by electing him into office. The 24-year-old insisted that his life story is representative of real 'true red-blooded American conservatism' - not the watered down version where GOP candidates emerge as ‘whitewashed,' perfect people. Haskins went on to describe his core values as his 'stool of conservatism' that stands on faith, family and freedom. As someone intimately familiar with the criminal justice system, the 24-year-old said if elected, he plans to propose laws that would help former inmates find employment after release. The Democrat who currently holds the 95th District House seat that Haskins is seeking is running for state Senate. Haskins, the sole Republican in the race, will face the Democrat who wins a primary in August.","Jordan Haskins, of Saginaw, Michigan, was sentenced to a year in prison in 2011 for taking city vehicles on sex-fueled joyrides .

"A Saudi university student has died of a heart attack after male paramedics were prevented by authorities from entering the women-only campus to treat her for more than an hour. Thousands of people took to twitter to vent their anger at the treatment of Amna Bawazeer and blame the kingdom's segregation rules for her death. She collapsed at King Saud University in the country's capital Riyadh on Wednesday at about 11am but did not get seen by the ambulance crews until 12.45pm. Strict: Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islam, meaning women are veiled in the company of men and segregation is widely enforced, such as here were women queue at one counter and men at the other . But when emergency services arrived at the gates of the university, administrators barred the male crew from treating her, a local newspaper claimed. When they were finally allowed to care for the victim she had died, it was reported. The university's rector, Badran Al-Omar, denied the report, saying there was no hesitation in letting the paramedics in. He added that the university did all it could to save the life of the student. Tragic: The incident unfolded on the strictly segregated women-only campus of King Saud University, pictured, in Riyadh .

While . religious police denied they blocked girls from fleeing and a . government inquiry found the school was ill-equipped to handle . emergencies, the incident led to the overhaul of women's education. Colleges . for women had been under the purview of the Department of Religious . Guidance and clerics, but after the fire it was placed under the . Education Ministry, which oversees male education.

"Lewis Hamilton continued his domination of the inaugural Russian Grand Prix to claim the 38th pole position of his Formula One career, but only after a major error from Williams' Valtteri Bottas. After finishing comfortably quickest in the second and third practice runs around F1's newest venue, the Sochi Autodrom, Hamilton topped the timesheet in all three qualifying sessions. and will lead away the field on Sunday. There was a scare, though, as Bottas was fastest in the first two sectors of the track on his final flying lap, only to make errors over the final third to finish third behind Hamilton and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. Click here to read our qualifying report. Host commentator . Thank you for your company today, and be sure to join our coverage for tomorrow's race. Until then, read our developing report of qualifying. Lewis Hamilton claims the 38th pole of his career. He appears to have the edge over Nico Rosberg here, but what of Valtteri Bottas? He was so close to splitting the Mercedes drivers until that error at the final corner. Russian GP Grid: 1 Hamilton; 2 Rosberg; 3 Bottas; 4 Button; 5 Kvyat; 6 Magnussen*, 7. Ricciardo, 8. Alonso, 9. Raikkonen, 10. Vergne . *Magnussen will serve five-place grid penalty . Lewis Hamilton improves on his time with a 1:38.513 and Rosberg doesn't have a response. But here is someone who can - it's Valtteri Bottas who is faster than anyone in the middle sector but the Finn can't keep his Williams under control through the final corners and has to settle for 3rd. He could have taken pole there. Rosberg responds and is up in the middle sector, but he has a scruffy end to his lap and he is two tenths shy of his team-mate. Bottas is 3rd with Button in 4th and Ricciardo 5th for Red Bull. But Hamilton is back on song and, for the moment, takes provisional pole with a 1:38.647. Hamilton also had a problem at Turn 10 which would have compromised him through Turns 11 and 12, going some way to explaining his time. He is down in sixth, but is on another competitive lap... Raikkonen is first over the line with a 1:41.5... but here comes Hamilton, he makes a mistake at Turn 7, but still goes fastest. Rosberg, however, trumps Hamilton by ONE SECOND with a 1:38.946. Bottas is second only a couple of tenths back. Hamilton is the first of the Mercedes drivers to take to the circuit. Surely, the Briton won't be beaten today? We're underway in Sochi and just 12 minutes away from finding out who will be on pole for the inaugural Russian Grand Prix. Here's a hugley disappointed Felipe Massa, who will start a miserable 18th tomorrow. 'The only thing I know is that here was no power. There was a problem with the fuel pressure I think. I was trying to talk to them to get the power back in the engine but it was not possible. I am so disappointed.' So, Hamilton finished the session almost three tenths clear of Rosberg. Over at Red Bull and Vettel was three tenths slower than Ricciardo... Sebastian Vettel falls at the Q2 hurdle. He will start only 11th tomorrow. Perez, Hulkenberg, Gutierrez, Sutil, Vettel and Grosjean in the bottom six with one minute remaining... Vettel improves on his time, but it is only good enough to promote him one place to 14th. Does the four-time World Champion have some sort of problem? Red Bull were expecting to struggle this weekend, but not by this much, surely? Ricciardo is 7th, over a second quicker than his team-mate... But as I say that, Alonso slots in to P7 and Raikkonen is eighth fastest. Vettel is way down the order in 15th. Rosberg improves on his time, but he is still a quarter of a second shy of Hamilton. The Ferrari pair of Raikkonen and Alonso meanwhile are out of the top 10 with only five minutes left. Bottas currently splits the Mercedes with some six minutes remaining. The Finn really has been one of the breakthrough performers of this season. But what of Lewis Hamilton? Here comes the championship leader and he is SIX TENTHS faster than Rosberg and Co. It looks as though Hamilton has really stepped up a gear as he bids to win his first championship since 2008. Magnussen slots into second and is only four thousandths of a second of Rosberg's best time. McLaren appear to be back on form here. Button then goes almost seven tenths quicker than his former McLaren team-mate only for Rosberg to go fastest with a 1:38.9, four tenths quicker than Button. Sergio Perez is the first man over the line in the second part of qualifying with a 1:40.1. The 15-minute session, to determine which drivers go through to the top-10 shootout, in Sochi is underway. A nice touch from FOM (Formula One Management), who control the TV feed, to display a message of support to Bianchi on the exit of the final corner. Lewis Hamilton ends the session three tenths clear of Rosberg, with Bottas, in the sister Williams, the best of the rest in P3. Lots of concerned faces down at Williams as the chequered flag falls and Massa fails to improve on his time. And to make matters worse, Ericcsson goes faster than the former Ferrari man. Massa will start only 18th tomorrow. Massa: 'You need to do something. I cannot do anything.' The exasperated Brazilian is readying himself for one final run, but he really appears to be down on speed. Massa posts his best lap of the afternoon, but it is only good enough for P17 - the Brazilian, battling a problem with his Williams, is in real danger of missing out on Q2 here. With only three minutes remaining, Pastor Maldonado, Marcus Ericsson, Kamui Kobayashi, Max Chilton and a struggling Felipe Massa occupy the bottom five places. Hamilton goes three tenths quicker than Rosberg as we see the German making a mistake at Turn 10 after running wide. A 1:38.759 from Hamilton is only marginally slower than his best lap of the morning session. And Rosberg goes even quicker on the soft compound; some two tenths better than his first flyer. Button meanwhile is in fifth, running on the slower medium compound. A good effort from the British driver, still chasing a seat next season. But Nico Rosberg responds to his team-mate's time with a 1:39.292 which is almost seven tenths quicker than Hamilton. Kvyat is third with the McLarens of Magnussen and Button fourth and fifth respectively. But here comes the in-form Hamilton, who despite a lock-up, goes more than a second quicker than the Russian. Jenson Button, who has impressed for McLaren this weekend, posts the fastest time of the session so far, only to be trumped by home favourite Daniil Kvyat in his Toro Rosso. Lewis Hamilton is the first of the frontrunners to take to the track. Hamilton is on the soft tyre, which would suggest Mercedes are not confident they'll be able to make it through to Q2 on the slower, medium compound. With Marussia entering only one car, it's worth noting that only five cars will be eliminated from this opening session. The pit lane is open and the opening 18-minute session is underway in Sochi. The drivers are strapped in their cockpits and ready for qualifying for tomorrow’s Russian Grand Prix. We will be underway in a couple of minutes. The Sochi Autodrom is the newest venue to join the F1 calendar, with the track winding its way through the site that hosted the Winter Olympics earlier this year. The organisers are proudly boasting it to be the only track in the world to be located in an Olympic venue, and the only one to be both permanent and a street circuit as it integrates into Sochi's general infrastructure during non-racing periods. At 5.853km in length, it is the third longest circuit on the current calendar behind Silverstone (5.891km) and Spa (7.004km). Although a street circuit, cars are expected to hit speeds of 200mph on the main straight between turns one and two. The Russian Grand Prix weekend got off to the best of starts for British racing after Dean Stoneman stormed to a lights-to-flag victory in this morning’s GP3 race. After securing pole, the young Briton led from the front before posting the fastest lap, too. All of this on his debut for the Koiranen team; incredibly impressive. Jules Bianchi's crash was so shocking that it's almost difficult to put into words. I was informed of the severity of his accident by the FIA immediately after the Japanese Grand Prix; that it was extremely serious and as such the race result became completely irrelevant. You would have seen that Lewis Hamilton, Sebastian Vettel and I did not spray any champagne on the podium. It wasn't a time to celebrate. JONATHAN McEVOY EXCLUSIVE: British television coverage of the Russian Grand Prix - the most security-conscious race ever staged - could go blank moments before Vladimir Putin arrives at the Sochi Autodrom on Sunday. Back on track and Lewis Hamilton has so far carried his good form through to Russia after setting a searing pace in this morning’s final practice session. Despite a late spin, the Briton was the best part of three tenths clear of team-mate and rival for the championship Nico Rosberg, as he bids for his fourth straight win. It’s been a difficult week for all of those connected with the sport of Formula One with Jules Bianchi in hospital following his horror crash at the Japanese Grand Prix. The F1 paddock has returned to work this week, albeit with a heavy heart, for the inaugural Russian Grand Prix just days after Bianchi was left with a severe head trauma after he ploughed into the back of a tractor. The drivers will sport tributes to Bianchi, fighting for his life in Mie University Hospital, with stickers on their crash helmets. Jean-Eric Vergne, the Toro Rosso driver, countryman and close friend of Bianchi, summed up the mood in the paddock when he poignantly said: ‘I am not going to race for me. I am not going to race for my team. I am going to race for him’.","Hamilton edged out Rosberg to secure pole for the inaugural race in Russia .

Huddersfield Giants celebrate scoring a try as they aimed to keep their Grand Final Hopes alive . Dragons' coach Laurent Frayssinous was delighted with the character shown by his players . Louis Anderson (left) only flew in from Perpignan on the day of the game . The Dragons, who knocked out Challenge Cup winners Leeds in the first round of the play-offs, scored tries through three-quarters Ben Pomeroy, Michael Oldfield and Daryl Millard to repeat their 2009 preliminary semi-final win at the John Smith's Stadium. The match had been in some doubt after a power failure left half the stadium in darkness but it kicked off on time after both clubs expressed a willingness for it to go ahead. Frayssinous said: 'We went in middle of field and said we would not find any excuses about our performances. The players have got a good attitude and they wanted to perform on the field no matter what.' Huddersfield were much improved from their 57-4 hammering at Wigan but an 11th defeat in 14 play-off ties left coach Paul Anderson bitterly disappointed.

'It hurts more than last week because the year is over,' Anderson said. 'We saw an improvement in some areas and the scoreline wasn't as bad as last week. 'But it was a reflection of our year. We were good in patches. All year we have never strung 80 minutes together and it was the same tonight. We never turned the screw and it has been the tale of our year. 'I am massively disappointed about the season. We started round one with big expectation but consistency throughout the year cost us. 'It wasn't just week by week but within games. 'We have had inconsistencies within performance and individual performances throughout games. It ends up hurting you. 'We went into this game with every expectation of winning, going to St Helens and winning the competition. But it has gone. 'For the investment in this team and this club it's not good enough.

"Huddersfield Giants have signed half-back Jamie Ellis from Castleford Tigers on a two-year deal. Ellis has made 14 league appearances for the Tigers this season, scoring two tries and kicking ten goals. The 24-year-old told the club website: 'There is an opportunity to play at scrum-half, my favoured position.' Ellis is the second Castleford player to sign for Huddersfield in recent weeks, following prop Craig Huby in moving to the John Smith's Stadium. Jamie Ellis, who's moving to Huddersfield, scores a try for Castleford in the Challenge Cup semi-final . Ellis made 14 Super League appearances for the Tigers this season, scoring two tries and kicking 10 goals . He continued: 'Obviously my place isn't guaranteed. I'm going to come here, train hard and hopefully get my chance. 'I know a few of the lads already at the Club. Brett Ferres was at Castleford and Craig Huby has also signed which will make it easier to bed into the squad. I just can't wait to get started.' Huddersfield coach Paul Anderson said: 'Jamie will give us options. He is a very, very good young player. 'Jamie played more and more in a competitive Castleford side and proved his worth. He will add some depth to the halves position. We showed this year that when we had an injury in those positions we had to move people around and we struggled. 'Jamie also brings with him a good kicking game. When we lost Danny (Brough) to injury we knew we had nobody to kick the ball but Jamie can do that, he will become very important to us going forward.' Huddersfield coach Paul Anderson said Ellis's addition with give the Giants options . The club have also confirmed Jack Miller and Peter Aspinall have not been offered extended contracts and will not be part of the 2015 squad. Elsewhere, Hull FC have handed promising winger Callum Lancaster a full-time contract until the end of 2017. Lancaster, 17, made his Super League debut against Leeds Rhinos at Headingley in May and went on to score eight tries in his next four appearances, including consecutive hat-tricks against Widnes Vikings and Warrington Wolves.

"The sky was blue and sunny but a grey and doleful air gripped the paddock even as Lewis Hamilton was tearing to pole position for Sunday’s Russian Grand Prix. His reward should he win would be a handshake with Vladimir Putin if, as is rumoured, the president of the Russian Federation presents the victor’s trophy in this glittering steel and tarmac symbol of his own virility. But it is not the dubious politics of shadowy former Soviet states that accounted for the melancholic mood here on Saturday. That was summed up by the legend across the track: ‘Jules we are all supporting you’. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lewis Hamilton ditches his race car for the school run . Valtteri Bottas, Lewis Hamilton and  Nico Rosberg wave after taking the top three positions in the qualifying session of the inaugural Russian Grand Prix . Hamilton shakes Rosberg's hand after pipping him to take pole at the Russian Grand Prix qualifying . The British driver was all smiles after claiming the 38th pole position of his Formula One career . 1) Lewis Hamilton 2) Nico Rosberg 3) Valtteri Bottas 4) Jenson Button 5) Daniil Kvyat 6) Kevin Magnussen 7) Daniel Ricciardo 8) Fernando Alonso 9) Kimi Raikkonen 10) Jean-Eric Vergne . 11) Sebastian Vettel 12) Nico Hulkenberg 13) Sergio Perez 14) Esteban Gutierrez 15) Adrian Sutil 16) Romain Grosjean . 17) Marcus Ericsson 18) Felipe Massa 19) Kamui Kobayashi 20) Pastor Maldonado 21) Max Chilton . It was a reference to Jules Bianchi, the 25-year-old Marussia driver who remains on life support in a Japanese hospital after his terrible accident in Suzuka a week ago today. His condition 5,000 miles away shook the usual narrow focus of the 21 other members of the F1 drivers’ fraternity, men whose craft demands total self-absorption. ‘It’s something I’m trying my hardest not to think too much about,’ said Hamilton of Bianchi’s predicament, after beating Rosberg into second place in qualifying. ‘We all know it’s tough for everyone here. Getting into the car this weekend has been the weirdest and one of the most difficult in my racing career. But we need to keep the pedal down and keep going. I hope we have a strong, positive race and that everyone is safe.’ They were honest words from a driver who has never recoiled from danger at the wheel. Hamilton was in imperious form at the Sochi Autodrom as he claimed pole position . Rosberg will hope to get the better of his Mercedes team-mate at Sochi on Sunday . Williams driver Bottas (left) made errors in the final sector to finish  behind Hamilton and Rosberg . The demeanour of the three fastest qualifiers — Hamilton, Rosberg and Valtteri Bottas — was a little quieter than normal. There was no fist-pumping celebration or hollering down the radio. These were genuine manifestations of a deep but almost suppressed anxiety. Hamilton, driving as though unfazed, has been the master of the new Sochi Autodrom — 3.6 miles with 19 bends — since he first drove on it during practice on Friday. His margin of two-tenths of a second over Rosberg was emphatic enough, though Williams’s Bottas may have prised pole for himself but for veering wide as he strained at the final couple of corners. It was Hamilton’s seventh pole of the season and maintained the momentum that has carried him to three consecutive victories. Jenson Button drove impressively to fourth, his best qualifying performance since the British Grand Prix in July. Toro Rosso’s Russian Daniil Kvyat was fifth, somehow saving the best qualifying performance of his life for his home audience. However, the main grandstand was half-empty, though other parts of the stadium looked pretty full. Mailonline will be covering every twist and turn from the Russian Grand Prix LIVE on Sunday . Hamilton set the pace on Saturday - he is bidding to claim his fourth win on the spin . The 29-year-old is chasing  a fourth consecutive win after claiming victory in Italy, Singapore and Japan . The other home representation in the race comes in the form of Bianchi’s Marussia team. They are based in Banbury, Oxfordshire but are owned by Andrey Cheglakov, a businessman just short of oligarch status. Out of respect to Bianchi, his team ran just one car, driven by Brit Max Chilton. Alas, he finished last. But through the pall, he said: ‘It has been a difficult weekend for us all, so all in all we’ve done well. With the whole team around me we can try to do the best we can for Jules.’ Victory for Hamilton, who leads Rosberg by 10 points with three rounds remaining after Sunday, would take him closer to a second world title and provide the highlight of a wonderful weekend here for British drivers. For as Hamilton did his debriefs, Jolyon Palmer, son of ex-Formula One driver Dr Jonathan Palmer, was celebrating winning the GP2 race and series. Jenson Button will start fourth in his McLaren, the Briton's second best grid slot of the campaign . He became the first British winner of F1’s feeder series since Hamilton in 2006. Aged 23, he is looking for a race in the top echelon but, heavens, it will be hard because the lesser teams are looking for drivers to pay them huge sums to land a race seat. Palmer Snr was in tears as he looked up at the podium with God Save the Queen ringing out. ‘We know it will be hard to get into Formula One but Jolyon has done a fantastic job this season,’ he said. ‘We are speaking to a few people but are realistic. We are keeping our fingers crossed.’ Earlier, another Brit, with an astonishing story of courage, won the GP3 race. Dean Stoneman, who has recently recovered from cancer, lost his drive with Marussia GP3 team when they decided not to race in Sochi for ‘commercial reasons’. He hitched a race with Finnish team Koiranen — and won. Jolyon Palmer became the first Brit to win the GP2 title since Lewis Hamilton in 2006 . Home hope Daniil Kvyat secured the best position of his fledgling career with fifth in his Toro Rosso . Sebastian Vettel had a very disappointing day and finished 11th in qualifying for the Russian Grand Prix . Before the inaugural Russian Grand Prix starts, all eyes will be on Putin and his guards. He loves projecting his all-action image. Here at the Winter Olympics in February he was at every major event from the opening and closing ceremonies to the ice hockey and even to the bedside of stricken skier Maria Komissarova, where she woke up to find him wearing a white coat. But there is a catch now. Given the sanctions imposed by the West after the crisis in Ukraine, the seizure of Crimea and the downing of a Malaysian airliner near Donetsk, Putin and his cronies are less keen to be seen enjoying themselves. A sense of ill-will towards him was displayed at the Euro 2016 match in Minsk between Belarus and Ukraine this week. Fans of both sides sang an insulting song about Putin. Eight were jailed, others convicted and fined. Will such elements find their way into the stands here? A tight security operation — armed guards, Cossack warriors, scanning machines — says they won’t.","Lewis Hamilton took pole position at the Russian Grand Prix .

"St Helens forward Kyle Amor says Thursday's Super League play-off semi-final against Catalans will be the biggest game of his career. Amor, who joined Saints from Wakefield this year, scored as Saints routed Castleford 41-0 to reach the last four. The bearded 27-year-old said: 'You come to big clubs to play in big games and to ultimately win trophies, so these games are the types you want to be tested for. Kyle Amor says the Super League play-off semi-final against Catalans will be the biggest game of his career . 'It's something I've not done before, so personally it's probably the biggest 80 minutes of my career. 'I was at Wakefield and we got one taste of the play-offs but we were only in for one week; so in terms of experience in the play-offs I'm still only a pup. 'To get to a Grand Final would be something tremendous.' Nathan Brown's side come into the game having had an extra week off. By contrast, the Dragons' visit to Langtree Park on Thursday will be their third match in a row away from home, but they have won impressively at Leeds and then Huddersfield to get to within one game of a first ever Grand Final. Nathan Brown said his side will benefit from their week off but it will count for nothing if they don't play well . 'There's no doubt that a third flight in a row is tough, and deep down in the back of their mind they know that is tough,' said Brown. 'Us having the week off is definitely an advantage, but none of those things work in your favour if you don't play well.' Saints are looking to reach their first Grand Final since 2011, having not won the competition since 2006. After winning 19 of the 27 matches during the regular season, St Helens secured their fifth League Leaders' Shield. Amor said the purpose of moving to St Helens was to 'play in big games and to ultimately win trophies' Former Saint Martin Gleeson has announced his retirement from rugby league but will remain with Salford Red Devils in a coaching role. The 34-year-old former Great Britain centre will take up a position with the Super League club's academy. 'I'm looking forward to my new career, starting with developing the youth of Salford and taking my first steps as a coach,' Gleeson told the club website.","St Helens face Catalan Dragons in Super League play-off semi-final .

"Diego Costa has reassured Chelsea he will not play in Spain's upcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers against Slovakia and Luxembourg if he is not fully fit. Although he has been in prolific goalscoring form for the Blues since his summer move from Atletico Madrid, Costa has been struggling with a hamstring problem since last season and Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho revealed recently the 25-year-old was barely training. Mourinho would also have preferred to see his player rest during the international break in order to receive treatment. Diego Costa said he will not play for Spain unless he is sure he is physically up to the task . Costa, nevertheless, was called up by Spain coach Vicente del Bosque for the upcoming qualifying double-header, and the Brazil-born forward insists he is ready to contribute. 'I'm here ready to play,' he said to Marca after linking up with his international colleagues on Monday. 'I've had some problems but it's getting better. 'I've already played three games in a week and the coach (Del Bosque) knows that I carry some problems but I will treat them during the week.' However, Costa also says he will not take any risks with his fitness. Costa said that Spain boss Vicente del Bosque was aware of his hamstring situation . He added: 'I don't want to be in the middle (of Spain and Chelsea). Mourinho has not told me anything. 'One has to take into account that many times I am the one that makes the decision depending on how I feel. 'Here I have the confidence of the coach, the technical team, and if there is a problem I tell them. 'If I'm here and I'm injured then I don't play because it would be worse.' Costa, who made his Spain debut in March in a 1-0 friendly win over Italy, has yet to score for his adopted country after five matches but he is hoping to finally make an impact with the two-time defending European champions. He said: 'What I want more than anything is to succeed here (national team). Up to now things haven't gone as I had thought they would or as people expected. 'This is why I really want to do a good job with Spain. Costa insisted that Jose Mourinho had given him no instructions regarding his international duty . 'I haven't scored but if you look at the games I've played, I haven't really had many opportunities to do so. 'I need to work hard in order to score my first goal, something which would make me very happy.' Costa moved to Chelsea from Atletico in a £32million transfer deal this summer and he has not disappointed. He scored his ninth league goal in Sunday's 2-0 triumph over Arsenal that lifted Chelsea five points clear at the top of the Premier League standings. 'Things are going very well, but not just for me but for Chelsea,' Costa said. 'I'm delighted. 'Against Arsenal it was complicated but we managed to win.'

"Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has urged yes and no campaigners to move forward following yesterday's decisive referendum result, saying 'the war of words is done…it's time to unite'. Mr Brown said opposing voters must 'move from the battle ground to the common ground...to find a way forward for the future'. At a speech in Fife, a day after Scotland voted to remain part of the Union, Mr Brown also pledged that the promises made on further devolution would be delivered. Scroll down for video . Gordon Brown said yes and no campaigners must now unite and urged the country to move forward during a speech in Fife, Scotland, today . The former Labour leader, whose intervention in the referendum campaign has been credited with helping to secure the No vote, said: 'We can find ways to unify against the odds. 'There is a time to fight but there is a time to unite and this is the time for Scotland to unite and see if it can find common purpose and move from the battle ground to the common ground and let us seek to find high ground in trying to find a way forward for the future.' 'Today I want to set out proposals that might be discussed across the country that might unite this country around a set of common causes we can all endorse, Yes and No campaigners. 'The eyes of the world have been upon us and now I think the eyes of the world are on the leaders of the major parties of the United Kingdom. These are men who have been promise makers and they will not be promise breakers. The former Labour leader, whose intervention in the referendum campaign has been credited with helping to secure the No vote, said: 'We can find ways to unify against the odds' Alex Salmond yesterday announced that he would step down as First Minister in November following the confirmation that his 'Yes' campaign had lost by 10 per cent .

'I will ensure that as a promise keeper that these promises that have been made will be upheld. 'We will lock in today the promises that have been made and why the timetable we set out will be delivered. Action has already been taken to make sure that happens.' The biggest victim of the referendum battle was Alex Salmond, who announced hours after the result that he would quit as First Minister and Scottish National Party leader. In a passionate speech delivered in Fife today, former PM Gordon Brown set out a schedule for the devolution of powers to Scotland: . Mr Brown praised the First Minister for his years of service and said the people of Scotland of Scotland owed him a debt of gratitude. Mr Salmond dramatically resigned yesterday afternoon just hours after voters rejected independence. He announced his departure at a press conference saying 'party, Parliament and country' would benefit from 'new leadership'. But he fired a warning shot at David Cameron not to go back on his promise to transfer sweeping new powers to Holyrood within six months. In Mr Brown's speech today he also spoke of the need to revitalise industry in Scotland, claiming the country must adapt to changes in the world. He said: 'The quarrel is not with England, the real quarrel is with globalization and the changes and we have got to manage it for good or it will enforce injustices upon us.' Mr Brown also spelled out his timetable for constitutional change and devolution of powers to Scotland, following the signing of a resolution by the leaders of the three major political parties. He said: 'Immediately after the referendum, in discussions with the leaders of the parties, lock-in measure one was taken, a resolution that is issued today, was submitted, that will be placed in the House of Commons on Monday. 'Second, what we can call lock-in measure two: having taken the unusual step of approaching the civil service, I have a direct assurance that while September 18 was decision day, September 19 was delivery day and today, September 20, is delivery day and every day thereafter is delivery day until a new Scotland Act comes into being, to ensure the timetable is honoured and upheld. 'But third, what I will call lock-in measure three: to ensure proper scrutiny of the timetable I will lead a debate in the House of Commons in its first week back on October 16. He excitedly told the audience: 'We have set down a timetable that is absolutely clear. 'That a command paper will be published by the end of October, that the heads of agreement between the parties and further devolution will come in November and that the draft legislation, the laws that will form the Scotland Bill and eventually the Scotland Act, will be ready by the end of January. 'If you like, by St Andrew's Day the heads of agreement, and by Burns Day the laws that we will then enact for the future of the country.'","Mr Brown asks warring sides to go from 'battle ground to common ground'

Mr Berry, 39, and his 29-year-old wife, . who was Miss Venezuela 2004 and is an American citizen, were gunned down by thieves after their car . broke down on the Puerto-Cabello to Valencia highway at about 10pm on . Monday. Police had said that the pair were shot in front of Maya - who was also hit in the leg - as their car was being . loaded onto a tow truck they had stopped after puncturing a tyre on the . motorway between Puerto Cabello and Venezuela's third largest city . Valencia. But in an interview today, Ms Spear's brother Ricardo claimed the girl was not yet aware of her parents' fate. Scroll down for video . Mr Berry, left, and Ms Spears, right, with their daughter Maya, 5. She was injured in the attack and is now in the care of the authorities . Orphan: Maya is being cared for by relatives and both sides of the family have agreed it is best if she lives in the US because of the rate of violence in Venezuela . Horrific: Robbers shot through the car windscreen when the terrified family locked themselves in . Nightmare: A friend of Berry said he had spoken to him on Sunday and was told they were having a great time . 'Maya isn't yet aware that her parents have been murdered', he told NTV24. 'It's a terrible tragedy what has happened to her and as long as we can give her time to recover we will be there for her.' 'She's taken a bullet to her leg and is injured. She's in a private clinic in Caracas and is safe with her grandparents.' Meanwhile, a . violent gang known as ‘The Quick Ones’ are being investigated for the . couple's brutal murder. One . of its members, called Adolfito – or little Adolfo – was captured by . neighbours and handed over to police on suspicion of shooting dead the . couple, according to authorities. 'El Adolfito' is said to have been . arrested by police on at least nine occasions. Two other suspects aged just 15 and 16 are also being held. Police made a total of five arrests. Rafael Lacava, mayor of the town of Puerto Cabello near to the scene of Monday night's horror shooting, revealed the gang of six - called 'Los Rapiditos' in Spanish - also include two women. They have been questioned by local police and now face further scrutiny from murder squad detectives and state prosecutors. 'El Adolfito' is said to have been arrested by police on at least nine occasions. Police believe the couple may have fallen victim to a trap after a recent spate of robberies where grates have been taken off drains or holes dug into roads to force cars off the road. People gather in a demonstration in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, to protest over the death of Monica Spear . A fan of Monica Spear wipes away tears while taking part in the Caracas demonstration on Wednesday. Crowds gathered to protest the violence that has gripped the country . Monica Spear posted a video on Instagram of her horse riding just hours before she died . New horizons: Monica Spear posted this photo of she and her daughter Maya just days before the fatal attack that left her and her ex-husband dead . A still from a short film showing the actress riding before she blew a kiss to the camera on the day she died . Police believe the couple may have been targeted by bandits who put obstacles in the road to force victims to stop. The ploy is commonly used on the country's highways after dark. Venezuela is one the most violent places in Latin America and armed robberies, carjackings and kidnappings are rife. The annual murder rate in Caracas alone is an average of 80 murders per 100,000 people, the third highest in the world. Most . murders occur in the slums where police presence is minimal. Eastern . Caracas is home to South America’s largest slum, named Petare with more . than two million residents, where the police to public ratio is 1 . officer to every 3,000 people. There . were an estimated 24,000 murders in 2013, one of the world’s highest . homicide rates. It has tripled in the previous decade. Gun ownership is also high, with an estimated 15 million unlicensed weapons in circulation. Police have confirmed the pair were shot in front of Maya as their car was being loaded onto a tow truck they had stopped after puncturing a tyre on the motorway between Puerto Cabello and Venezuela's third largest city Valencia. Police chief Jose Gregorio Sierralta said they were killed after locking themselves inside their Toyota Corolla to stop their attackers stealing their car as the tow truck driver and an assistant ran to a police checkpoint a mile away for help. ‘Unfortunately as the car was on the upper part of the tow truck several individuals surprised them and shot them inside the vehicle after seeing they had locked themselves inside,’ Mr Sierralta said. Relatives from both victims' families arrived in Venezuela today for their funerals, due to take place on Friday. Maya meanwhile was being comforted by Monica's family and her British-born paternal grandparents Tom and Kate, at a hospital in the Venezuelan capital. Mr Berry’s sister Katie, who lives in Edinburgh, was expected to join her retired university maths professor dad and mum today. She and her brother moved to Venezuela as young children but she returned to Britain to find work with her Venezuelan husband. Mr Berry, 39, a travel firm boss, also used to return regularly to Britain to see family and friends. Ms Spears' parents live in Orlando, Florida, and the actress lived with them while she studied at the University of Central Florida. Ms Spear’s aunt Mariela Mootz described her niece - voted Miss Venezuela in 2004 - as a ‘sweet young girl’. ‘She was so sweet, just like you see her in the photos,’ she said. ‘She was as beautiful a person on the inside as she was on the outside. ‘She was very loving and dreamed of triumphing in French cinema after spending time in France where she learnt the language. ‘There was no need for what happened. There's no respect for life anymore.’ Better times: Some friends thought that they were going to announce that they were back together after the January vacation (seen at their wedding in 2008, the same year that their daughter was born) Police tape cordons off the couple's car, which had ground to a halt after the tires were punctured . Heartbreaking: Monica Spear Mootz, 29, and Thomas Berry, 39, had an amicable split a year earlier but took vacations together with their daughter- including the one they were on when they were killed . Monica Spear was visiting Venezuela so her daughter could learn about the country . Mr Berry, who described himself as an independent travel consultant in an online profile, lived in the capital Caracas, according to El Universal. He moved to Florida for a short time after he was shot 15 years ago in a robbery that killed his friend. It is understood Mr Berry and his wife had separated last year, but were still close friends and holidayed together for the sake of their daughter. Ms Spear’s father, Rafael, told the Orlando Sentinel: 'It is the deepest pain, the deepest pain. It is unbelievable. ‘She was very charismatic, a very good daughter, a very good mother, and she loved Venezuela.' Loving: Former Miss Venezuela Monica Spear Mootz and Thomas Berry had maintained a good relationship following their divorce and family say they were close to getting back together for the sake of Maya . He recalled how his daughter had come to him for advice when she wanted to change from her chemical engineering course to study acting instead. 'I told her she had to decide what she wanted to do to be happy for the rest of her life,' he said. 'When my children were young, I wouldn't let them watch telenovelas, and then she began acting in soap operas, and I began watching all of hers.' Luis Dominguez, Mr Berry’s business partner in the Arekay Tours adventure travel agency, said: ‘He had so much happiness that his loss makes me feel empty. ‘For this to happen to him is a great loss not only to his family and friends but to Venezuela as a whole. ‘He gave an enormous amount to this country and knew more about it than most Venezuelans.’ Ms Spear's family had asked her to move to the U.S. with them after she was robbed six times, but the model refused. Her brother, Ricardo Spear Mootz, said: 'She loved her country too much. It was her home.' Beauty: Monica Spear Mootz represented Venezuela in the 54th annual Miss Universe competition . Ms Spear with Maya, who was born in October 2008. The little girl was shot in the leg during the attack . During the 2005 Miss Universe contest Spear visited the Temple of the Emerald Buddha in Bangkok . Family friend Marytza Sanz said Miss Spear loved Venezuela and even though she could have remained in the U.S. she chose to return so her daughter could spend time there. The network Miss Spear worked for released a statement describing her as a 'great actress' who had 'extraordinary drive and determination'. Venezuela's public prosecutor has appointed two separate investigators to the case, while the CICPC, Venezuela's SWAT police force unit, has been deployed to nearby slums for answers. Nicolas Maduro, the Venezuelan President, meanwhile vowed to respond to the violence gripping the country with ‘an iron fist’. 'There will be no tolerance to those who carry out acts like that, killing decent men and women, who have a right to live,' he said.","Thomas Berry and Monica Spear Mootz were stranded after car broke down .

"The Beach Boys treasure trove which lay in a Florida storage unit for years includes photographs, lyrics and music, and is expected to sell for $10m . A 'lost' archive of original music manuscripts by the Beach Boys for 150 of their songs has emerged for sale for nearly £7m. The vast collection spanning the first 20 years of the band's hugely successful career, lay forgotten in a storage unit before it was found and put up for auction. The treasure trove includes original, hand-written musical arrangements for hits like Surfin USA , God Only Knows, California Girls and I Get Around. There is printed sheet music for other classics like Good Vibrations, Fun, Fun, Fun and Don't Worry Baby. It also includes handwritten lyrics, recording contracts and copyright certificates signed by Brian Wilson and Mike Love, royalty cheques and personal letters. And there are more than 60 behind-the-scenes photos of the hugely successful American rock band, many of which have never been seen before. The documents, which will go on show in London next week, are all original and were mostly created in the 1960s. The archive is being sold as a single lot and has been billed as one of the most important ever auctions of pop memorabilia. Incredibly, it was only discovered by chance when a small company dealing in music promotion took part in a 'lucky dip' blind auction at a lock-up facility in Florida, US. Scroll down for video . The storage unit contents which originally sold for just a few hundred dollars contain original lyrics and scores . They were then astonished to discover that the few hundred dollars they had gambled on the lock-up contents had bought them original music, lyrics and photographs worth millions of dollars. It is believed the material had been placed there for safe-keeping by an associate of the band in the late 1970s and then simply forgotten about. Its emergence led to a legal dispute which has since been settled after it was ruled it had been a 'fair find'. The surviving members of the Beach Boys are aware of the sale. The archive is being sold by British auctioneers the Fame Bureau in a sealed bid auction. Ted Owen, of the Fame Bureau, said: 'This archive is like the Bible of the Beach Boys career. It is so vast, it would take six months to catalogue. Among the crate's contents was the original studio arrangement for the Beach Boys' hit Surfin' USA . 'It is the largest archive of modern musical history that will ever likely be offered for sale from a group of musicians and genius songwriters that influenced the world. 'It covers 150 songs from the early development of the Beach Boys to their comeback of 1976. 'The majority of the songs include hand-written scores, publishing and copyright contracts and compositions for artist participation of drums, bass and strings. 'There will never be an archive like this ever again. Only the Beatles or the Rolling Stones would have this body of work but they are never going to come to light. Up for sale are the original studio arrangements for I Get Around, left, and the handwritten lyrics for Ain't It Sad . 'This sale has really come about by accident. The archive was lost over the course of time and was really found by chance. 'It was a blind storage unit sale and the items inside were listed as documents and books. 'A small company of music promoters took a gamble on it and bought the contents for a few hundred pounds. 'It didn't take them long to figure out what they had but it has taken some time to put a value on it. Photographs, many unseen, show the Beach Boys' private side - here Brian Wilson is seen at the mixing desk . The photos show the stars off-duty and relaxed - this image, dating back to the mid-1960s, is of the band in Rome . 'Of course it is the Beach Boys property and its discovery led to a protracted legal dispute which resulted in it being labelled a fair find.' Alan Boyd, the Beach Boys official archivist, said: 'This historic collection presents a priceless look into the inner workings of this legendary group. 'When these documents were created in the 1960s and '70s, there was no thought they would someday tell an important part of the story of one of the most impressive - not to mention lucrative - catalogues in the history of popular music.' The lost archive (this image shows the band in London in the late 1960s) is expected to sell for $10m . The Beach Boys, from California, formed in 1961 and were made up of brothers Brian, Dennis and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love and friend Al Jardine. They have sold more then 350 million records around the world and had 25 number one hits. Of the original line-up, drummer Dennis Wilson tragically drowned in 1983 aged 39 and brother Carl died of cancer in 1998. The archive will be displayed in New York on April 15 and at London's Hard Rock Cafe on April 18. The deadline for the sealed bids for the auction is May 15.","Handwritten songs and scores, plus unseen photographs, for sale in London .

"The tycoon at the heart of a faulty breast implant scandal involving thousands of British woman is preparing to re-launch his bankrupt company, it was claimed today. Jean-Claude Mas, 72, is facing a variety of charges including manslaughter following the collapse of Poly Implant Prothese, which went into liquidation last year. But now the self-styled ‘creative genius’ is ready to start the business up again under a new name so that it can provide up to 60,000 implants a year. Jean-Claude Mas, pictured holding a breast implant, is facing charges including manslaughter following the collapse of Poly Implant Prothese. It today emerged that he is preparing to re-launch his bankrupt company . Astonishingly, the firm boasts about having a start-up fund worth as much as £6million - a figure which will be of huge interest to some 250 women in the UK who have launched civil proceedings over their allegedly faulty PIP implants. The French firm sold implants full of . industrial silicone which ended up in some 400,000 women around the . world, including around 40,000 in Britain. Many of the discount products have since split open, while others have been linked with a variety of illnesses. Brazilian health officials today said they are permanently banning the sale of the faulty French-made PIP breast implants. The Health Ministry's National Agency for Sanitary Vigilance said its decision is based on tests conducted in France showing that women who got the implants could experience harmful leaks of cheap, industrial-grade silicone, not the medical-grade gel that higher-quality implants use. An agency statement says that sales of implants made by the now-defunct company Poly Implant Prothese have been banned in Brazil since April 2010. The latest decision makes that ban permanent. Brazil imported 34,631 of the implants and 24,534 were sold. The remaining implants will be destroyed. Now Nice Matin, the regional newspaper covering Mas’s home in Seyne-sur-Mer, the town near Toulon where he launched PIP in 1991, has uncovered documents proving Mas wants to relaunch it under a new name. Called ‘France Implant Technology’, the new company was created on June 15, 2011 under the names of his two children, Nicolas Lucciardi, 27, and Peggy Lucciardi, 24. It will relaunch at the £5million . factory once used by PIP in Seyne-su-Mere, and – according to the new . business plan – will ‘sell in the very short term more than 60,000 . implants a year’, using a cash fund of more than 6 million euros. ‘The team is largely in place,’ says the plan, referring to some 120 PIP staff who were made redundant last year. Mas is referred to twice in the plan – . dated September 29, 2011 – as a ‘creative genius with 30 years of . experience in breast implants’, and will officially be a ‘consultant’ to . FIT. The tycoon made . millions from PIP, while the factory site is now officially owned by a . company run by Dominique Lucciardi, the 66-year-old mother of his two . children. Health scare: One of PIP's breast implants, that contain industrial-grade silicon . ‘It’s very clear that Mas wants to go back into the implant business under the guise of his close family,’ said a judicial source close to the case. ‘This will cause shock and alarm among all of his thousands of alleged victims.’ Mas currently claims to be bed-ridden following cardio-vascular surgery, but his son, Nicolas, said plans for the new company ‘have completely fallen apart’ because of the ‘media hype’ around PIP. As well as facing trial in France in late 2012, Mas is wanted for a serious drink-driving offence in Costa Rica, which could see him jailed for up to three years. Mas, who started his working life in his mother’s butcher’s shop, is thought to have saved up to £1million a year by using industrial silicon in the implants. He has admitted through his lawyer that the industrial-grade silicone implants, which could cause health problems if they burst or leak, ‘did not formally receive approval’ and regulations were violated. While France is to pay up to £60million for women to have their faulty PIP implants removed, the British government is currently taking no action beyond advising concerned women to consult their surgeons.","Jean-Claude Mas preparing to re-launch his bankrupt company Poly Implant Prothese, it was claimed today ."
"Newcastle's record goalscorer Alan Shearer fears his old club will spend the entire season in a relegation dogfight. One of the Magpies' favourite sons is dismayed to see his boyhood team in the Barclays Premier League's bottom three already and without a top-flight win since May. Manager Alan Pardew is due to take charge of the 700th game of his managerial career against Leicester this weekend but has come under heavy criticism from certain sections of the Newcastle support, as has the club's owner Mike Ashley. Alan Pardew's Newcastle side are third bottom of the Premier League and without a league win since May . Shearer, who was speaking at Manchester's National Football Museum where he was being inducted into the English Hall of Fame, does not see a light at the end of tunnel for his old club and thinks the remainder of the campaign could be spent in the top flight's lower reaches too. 'I think it will be a long, hard season for Newcastle with the way they've started off,' he said. 'Hopefully Papiss Cisse will be able to start games, if not on Saturday then shortly after that, because it looks like he's the only one who can score goals for them. 'They've been on a tough run since January and their form has been pretty poor. They need results and they need them quick. Papiss Cisse is one of the few Newcastle players currently on a good run of form for the club . 'They've sold a lot of their top players over the past few years, which obviously doesn't help, and the atmosphere isn't very good at St James' Park at the moment. 'We just hope that it can change against Leicester on Saturday.' There has been much finger-pointing in the north-east with regards to where the biggest portion of blame should lie. Newcastle fan Shearer played on Tyneside for a decade and had a short stint as a manager so is better placed than most to judge where the crux of the problem is. Alan Shearer lamented the sale of so many of Newcastle's best players in recent seasons . He believes selling their best players year on year is finally catching up with them. Mathieu Debuchy, Yohan Cabaye and Demba Ba were the latest players to depart the club in recent seasons, and Shearer added: 'It doesn't help when you sell your best players; that's stating the obvious. 'It also doesn't help when you're on a poor run and confidence is very, very low. 'The sooner they can get a win this season it will stop everyone talking about them trying to get their first one. They need to do it and they need to do it quickly.'","Newcastle are currently in the relegation zone of the Premier League .

"Lord Patten, chairman of the BBC Trust, has not commented publicly on the furore . The chairman of the BBC Trust has ruled out an independent investigation into alleged abuses by Jimmy Savile. In a letter to Conservative MP Rob Wilson, Lord Patten said such an inquiry was not necessary despite the gravity of the allegations against the BBC presenter and DJ, which are being investigated by Scotland Yard. Lord Patten, who has made no public comment on the scandal, also insisted no pressure was exerted on the editor of Newsnight to pull an investigation alleging that Savile had assaulted girls as young as 14. ITV pursued the story and since its shocking documentary was broadcast last Wednesday, more than 40 alleged victims have come forward. BBC insiders  have told The Mail on Sunday that their investigation, which began soon after Savile’s death last October, was shelved to avoid an embarrassing clash with tribute  programmes over Christmas and New Year. They say the decision was influenced by new director-general George Entwistle, who was then in charge of BBC1 and BBC2. Mr Wilson, MP for Reading East, wrote to Lord Patten last week calling for an independent inquiry into why the BBC pulled the investigation. Newsnight’s editor, Peter Rippon, has claimed he alone made the decision on purely editorial grounds. Mr Wilson told The Mail on Sunday: ‘[Chris Patten] wrote back to me saying the police were looking into the allegations and the BBC had offered their full support. He did not agree to sanction an independent investigation into wider allegations. He said that George Entwistle had reassured him no pressure was exerted on the editor of Newsnight to drop the story.’ This is not the belief of those inside the BBC. One Newsnight journalist said: ‘It was obvious from the initial reaction of Peter Rippon that this was seen as a  big story and he was very, very positive about it. But all of a sudden, a few days before the planned transmission date, we were told the film would not be going out. ‘We gather the decision leads directly to George Entwistle. The general belief was that he didn’t want the Newsnight report being screened when the BBC had a number of Jimmy Savile tributes in their schedule.’Another source said: ‘If there are stories which have legal issues or are sensitive, it is very unlikely the senior figures in news and vision would not be consulted.’ 'It appears, as the days go by, that Jimmy Savile was rotten', Tory MP Rob Wilson said . Last night, Mr Wilson confirmed he would be pursuing the matter and said: ‘It appears, as the days go by, that Jimmy Savile was rotten. The question is how much did that rottenness infect the BBC?’ Last night a BBC Trust spokesperson said: ‘As Lord Patten wrote to Rob Wilson, the Trust shares the horror felt by the  general public at allegations that anything of this sort could have happened on BBC premises or have been carried out by anyone working for the Corporation. ‘The director-general has asked the BBC Investigations Unit to make contact with all the police forces in receipt of allegations and provide full support to any lines of inquiry. ‘The Trust is satisfied this is the most appropriate action to take, particularly given that the allegations involve criminal activity.’","Chairman of the BBC Trust Lord Patten appeared to rule out an independent investigation .

Critics have wasted no time in lambasting the show. Jace Lacob of BuzzFeed tweeted: ‘The worst part of #Dads is that it is casually racist AND horrifically unfunny. Which is not a good combination, really.’ NPR's Linda Holmes explained that ‘it's mostly nasty about women of color.’ The show stars Seth Green, right, and Giovanni Ribisi, left, as successful video game developers and roommates whose lives unexpectedly change when their politically incorrect fathers move in . The show is filmed before a live studio audience but even that has been criticized. 'Having people braying at “ironic” racism makes it real racism,' wrote critic Todd VanDerWerff. The stars and producers of ‘Dads’ faced reporters Thursday and attempted to defend the show by claiming that it focused on human frailties for the sake of laughs and enlightenment. At the Television Critics Association meeting, they vowed to tweak the tone of the series as appropriate as the season unfolds. However a critical mauling doesn't mean a show it destined to fail, 'Two Broke Girls' and 'The Big Bang Theory' are shows critics love to hate, but the general public just seem to love.

"Playing computer games such as Angry Birds teaches children important life skills including concentration, resilience and problem solving, an academic has said. Professor Angela Mcfarlane, an education expert who will become head of training body the College of Teachers next month, said many games were complex and required deep learning and lateral thinking to solve them. Prof Mcfarlane said she herself had become 'hooked' on the Lemmings computer game, as well as Angry Birds, and said such games could have a place in the classroom provided they were used under supervision. Professor Angela Mcfarlane says computer games like Angry Birds can teach children valuable life-skills . Expert: Prof Mcfarlane says the games can help children learn problem solving, resilience and concentration . She said: 'There are many computer games that require quite deep learning to master the games. 'Some of that learning applies beyond games to wider life, such as concentration, problem solving, and resilience - important life skills. 'Anyone who has tried to play complex video games will know they are difficult.' Speaking to The Times, Prof Mcfarlane said she had developed an obsession with both Angry Birds and a precursor, Lemmings, because they had made her think and get her strategy right. The education expert, who has advised the government on educational technology, and who is currently writing a book, Authentic Learning for the Digital Generation, said computer games could be used in the classroom to good effect provided it was done properly. Prof Mcfarlane said even pre-school children could benefit from games, as long as they were supervised and not just given a phone to play with to keep them quiet. Prof Mcfarlane said she herself had become 'hooked' on a computer game called Lemmings, pictured . She said some games could teach children fine motor control, or help with vocabulary or simple maths, and taught skills such as resilience that could be applicable to real life. Next month Prof Mcfarlane, who began her career as a secondary school teacher and head of department, will become chief executive and registrar of the College of Teachers, which offers professional training to teachers and support staff.","Professor Angela Mcfarlane is an education expert and former teacher .

Rotherham (4-4-2): Collin 6; Richardson 7, Morgan 7, Arnason 6, Skarz 7; Hall 6 (Taylor 46, 7), Frecklington 6, Green 7, Pringle 7 (Smallwood 81); Derbyshire 6 (Clarke-Harris 63, 8), Revell 7. Subs not used: Loach, Broadfoot, Bowery, Swift. Booked: Frecklington, Revell, Clarke-Harris. Scorers: Revell 58, Clarke-Harris 65.

Subs not used: Byram, Sharp, Taylor, Cooper, Sloth. Booked: Bianchi, Silvestri, Doukara, Adryan. Scorers: Antenucci 30. Man of the match: Jonson Clarke-Harris. Referee: Keith Stroud. Who could possibly have imagined even a year or two ago that Rotherham United would have a chance of overhauling Leeds? But that was the prospect savoured by Steve Evans' double promotion-winners and it was enough to fill the New York Stadium even with live television cameras peering in. Evans rated it the biggest league game of his career as well as being the biggest of Rotherham's modern history. At the start only three points - in Leeds favour - separated these Yorkshire sides who ordinarily could never be described as rivals. But Mirco Antenucci scored against the run of play to cushion the threat. Souleymane Doukara split the Rotherham rearguard and as defenders looked for offside, Antenucci timed his run and calm finish to perfection. Either side of the Italian's third Leeds goal, Matt Derbyshire failed with a great chance for a Rotherham and Alex Revell forced Marco Silvestri into a full-length save. Clarke-Harris fired home from 25 yards for his first goal since £350,000 club record move from Oldham . But Leeds were increasingly menacing on the break to justify their advantage. It was their first meeting in ten seasons. Nevertheless, connections lingered. The Millers' Paul Green and Frazer Richardson had spells at Elland Road - and midfielder Lee Frecklington is a lifelong supporter.

Then substitute Jonson Clarke-Harris exploded off the bench as Evans' team seized the lead with a second goal in six minutes.

"A young Texas couple buried their five-day-old daughter today, after an obstetrician fatally cracked her skull and spine with forceps during delivery. Rachel Melancon, 24, and her fiance Allen Coats wrote on a Facebook support page today how pleased they were with the turnout at the funeral in Port Arthur, Texas. 'So many people came and donated and gave us support. We are standing here at peace because all of you! Y'all are truly carrying our pain in y'all's heart.' Hard Day: Rachel Melancon and Allen Coats buried their five-day-old daughter today, who died after suffering injuries during birth caused by forceps . Damage: Baby Olivia was born with a fractured skull and broken spinal cord, which left her brain damaged . Tribute: At the funeral today, mourners celebrated baby Olivia's short life by releasing hundreds of balloons into the overcast sky . At the memorial, mourners celebrated . baby Olivia Marie's short life, by release hundreds of balloons into an . overcast sky. The grieving parents called it the 'most beautiful thing . ever'. Since the . infant's passing, family, friends and strangers have been rallying to . support the young couple in their fight to sue both the obstetrician and . the Medical Center of Southeast Texas. Four . days ago, father Allen Coats started a Go Fund Me campaign for $20,000, . with the proceeds to cover medical and funeral costs, as well as spread . awareness about the damage forceps can do. As of Saturday evening, the campaign had raised nearly $9,000 of that goal from 432 donors. The sudden loss of their baby truly came as a surprise to the parents, as Melancon had experienced a healthy pregnancy. Ms Melancon, at 4ft 11in and weighing . 95lb before she became pregnant, had asked for a cesarean section when . her baby was overdue and large, considering her mother's petite frame. But . doctors warned her against having that type of delivery, saying she'd . be left with a scar, her mother-in-law Angie Coats told ABC News. After going into labor, baby Oliva's heart rate was increasing but the expectant mom kept being told to wait. Hope: Rachel had experienced a healthy pregnancy and the couple were looking forward to their baby's arrival . Heartbroken: Allen Coats and Rachel Melancon with baby Olivia whose skull was crushed during an attempted forceps delivery . Campaign: Rachel and Allen, pictured with Olivia, have started a petition to have forceps banned . 'It was 18 hours until the delivery. [Rachel] was running a 103 fever ... Five hours passed, then [the obstetrician] came in . and she started to push. But she was so worn out and the baby wasn't . even in the birth canal,' Ms Coats said. She claimed the baby was facing the wrong way and Dr Backardjiev tried to turn her with his hands. 'When he couldn't do that, he took the . small forceps to try to pull the baby out. He kept going and even put . his foot up on the bed trying to pull,' she said. In a forceps delivery a metal instrument, shaped like salad tongs, is clamped around the baby's head. They are used to either guide the baby out the birth canal or, if the baby is facing the wrong way, to rotate the baby. The mother is generally given an episiotomy - an incision from the vagina to the anus - as there is an increased likelihood of tearing. It is considered a risky delivery, with the Mayo Clinic reminding expectant mothers that generally when a forceps delivery is recommended a C-Section is also an option. In the mother, forceps can cause long-term urinary or fecal incontinence; genital tears; and damage to the uterus or bladder. For babies, forceps can cause fractures, bleeding within the skull and facial injuries. 'When he touched the top and side of the skull, we heard a pop, like clay cracking in pottery and heard her skull crush.' Ms Melancon was rushed off for an emergency cesarean but when Olivia was finally delivered the family say she was unable breathe. Their baby was rushed to Hermann Hospital, where the parents were told that she had suffered numerous fractures. In a post on their Facebook page, Ms Melancon said she heard . '2 big popping sounds (it was her skull)' as the doctor used the . forceps. She claimed . her baby was then left in the birth canal while the doctor stitched . Ms Melancon up before she could have the emergency C-section. 'I . felt her pulled out of me and the room was silent. No crying baby and . they told Allen to leave the room. That's the last I remember before . waking up to my baby girl lifeless,' she said in a heartbreaking post. The parents kept a vigil at Olivia's bedside for five days before she was taken off life support. Her heart valve and tissue behind her legs and knees were donated to save another baby's life. Hospital chief executive Matt Roberts released a statement saying that Olivia's death 'rips at our hearts'. The statement added that the hospital could not comment on specific cases but confirmed that a review would be carried out. As well as a Facebook page to detail their experiences and raise awareness, the couple have set up a Go Fund Me page to pay for the funeral and try to pass Olivia's Law to ban the use of forceps. Skull . fractures are a risk during forceps births. The Mayo Clinic advises: . 'Keep in mind that whenever a forceps delivery is recommended, a . C-section is typically also an option.'

"Scientists have revealed the most detailed map of the early universe ever created. Captured by the European Space Agency Planck satellite, it shows the split . second after the Big Bang - and indicates the universe is 80 million years . older that scientists had thought. Planck's portrait shows the oldest light in our Universe, imprinted on the . sky when it was just 380,000 years old. Scroll down for video . The most detailed map of the universe ever created - based on the initial 15.5 months of data from Planck and is the mission¿s first all-sky picture of the oldest light in our Universe, imprinted on the sky when it was just 380 000 years old . Planck’s . primary goal is to observe the Cosmic Microwave Background, the relic . radiation from the Big Bang, and to extract its encoded information . about what our universe is made of, and the origin of its structure. This . relic radiation can only be reached once all sources of foreground . emission, such as the galactic haze and the carbon monoxide signals, . have been identified and removed. The latest image shows oldest light in our Universe, imprinted on the . sky when it was just 380,000 years old. The image is based on . the initial 15.5 months of data from the £515m Planck space telescope. 'The extraordinary . quality of Planck’s portrait of the infant Universe allows us to peel . back its layers to the very foundations, revealing that our blueprint of . the cosmos is far from complete,' said says Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA’s Director General. Planck data also set a new value for the rate at which the Universe is expanding today, implying that the age of the Universe is 13.82 billion years - 80 million years older than previously thought. The findings bolster a key theory . called inflation, which says the universe burst from subatomic size to . its now-observable expanse in a fraction of a second. George Esfthathiou, an astrophysicist . who announced the Planck satellite mapping on Thursday, says the . findings also offer new specificity of the universe's composition. 'To a cosmologist, this map is a gold mine of information,'he said. He says it is made up of slightly more ordinary matter and less of the mysterious dark matter and dark energy. 'Since . the release of Planck’s first all-sky image in 2010, we have been . carefully extracting and analysing all of the foreground emissions that . lie between us and the Universe’s first light, revealing the cosmic . microwave background in the greatest detail yet,' said George Efstathiou . of the University of Cambridge, UK. The image is based on . the initial 15.5 months of data from Planck and is the mission’s first . all-sky picture of the oldest light in our Universe, imprinted on the . sky when it was just 380 000 years old. At that time, the young . Universe was filled with a hot dense soup of interacting protons, . electrons and photons at about 2700ºC. When the protons and electrons joined to form hydrogen atoms, the light was set free. As the Universe has expanded, this . light today has been stretched out to microwave wavelengths, equivalent . to a temperature of just 2.7 degrees above absolute zero. The new 'recipe for the universe': Planck's high-precision cosmic microwave background map has allowed scientists to extract the most refined values yet of the Universe¿s ingredients. This . ‘cosmic microwave background’ – CMB – shows tiny temperature . fluctuations that correspond to regions of slightly different densities . at very early times, representing the seeds of all future structure: the . stars and galaxies of today. According to the standard model of . cosmology, the fluctuations arose immediately after the Big Bang and . were stretched to cosmologically large scales during a brief period of . accelerated expansion known as inflation. Planck was designed to . map these fluctuations across the whole sky with greater resolution and . sensitivity than ever before. By analysing the nature and distribution . of the seeds in Planck’s CMB image, we can determine the composition and . evolution of the Universe from its birth to the present day. An artist's conception shows the Planck spacecraft against a microwave view of the sky. Overall, . the information extracted from Planck’s new map provides an excellent . confirmation of the standard model of cosmology at an unprecedented . accuracy, the researchers say. But because precision of Planck’s map is so high, it . also made it possible to reveal some peculiar unexplained features that . may well require new physics to be understood. One of the most surprising . findings is an asymmetry in the average temperatures on opposite hemispheres of the sky. This runs counter to the prediction made by the standard model that the Universe should be broadly similar in any direction we look. Furthermore, a cold spot extends over a patch of sky that is much larger than expected. The asymmetry and the cold spot had already been hinted at with Planck’s predecessor, NASA’s WMAP mission, but were largely ignored because of lingering doubts about their cosmic origin . 'The fact that Planck has made such a significant detection of these anomalies erases any doubts about their reality; it can no longer be said that they are artefacts of the measurements. 'They are real and we have to look for a credible explanation,' says Paolo Natoli of the University of Ferrara, Italy. 'Imagine investigating the foundations of a house and finding that parts of them are weak. You might not know whether the weaknesses will eventually topple the house, but you’d probably start looking for ways to reinforce it pretty quickly all the same,' adds François Bouchet of the Institut d’Astrophysique de Paris. One way to explain the anomalies is to propose that the Universe is in fact not the same in all directions on a larger scale than we can observe, ESA said. In this scenario, the light rays from the CMB may have taken a more complicated route through the Universe than previously understood, resulting in some of the unusual patterns observed today. The results show a cold spot extends over a patch of sky that is much larger than expected, challenging theories of the symmetry of the universe . 'Our ultimate goal would be to construct a new model that predicts the anomalies and links them together. 'But these are early days; so far, we don’t know whether this is possible and what type of new physics might be needed - and that’s exciting,' says Professor Efstathiou. Beyond the anomalies, however, the Planck data conform spectacularly well to the expectations of a rather simple model of the Universe, allowing scientists to extract the most refined values yet for its ingredients. Normal matter that makes up stars and galaxies contributes just 4.9% of the mass/energy density of the Universe. Dark matter, which has thus far only been detected indirectly by its gravitational influence, makes up 26.8%, nearly a fifth more than the previous estimate. Old and new: The previous best image of cosmic background radiation, (left), compared to the new Planck images released today (right) Conversely, dark energy, a mysterious force thought to be responsible for accelerating the expansion of the Universe, accounts for less than previously thought. 'With the most accurate and detailed maps of the microwave sky ever made, Planck is painting a new picture of the Universe that is pushing us to the limits of understanding current cosmological theories,” says Jan Tauber, ESA’s Planck Project Scientist. 'We see an almost perfect fit to the standard model of cosmology, but with intriguing features that force us to rethink some of our basic assumptions. 'This is the beginning of a new journey and we expect that our continued analysis of Planck data will help shed light on this conundrum.'

"This is the dramatic moment a 15-year-old boy, described as a 'model pupil', held up frightened bank workers in a video game-style robbery. In CCTV footage taken during the raid, the schoolboy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, can be seen brandishing the imitation firearm as he burst into the Barclays bank in Liverpool, Merseyside. Dressed all in black, with the fur-lined hood of his coat pulled tightly over his head, the teenager is shown pointing the weapon at staff members during the raid, which he carried out in the week Grand Theft Auto V was released. Scroll down for video . Raid: This is the terrifying moment a 15-year-old boy held up frightened bank workers with an imitation firearm in a video game-style robbery at a branch of Barclays bank in Liverpool, Merseyside . Hold up: Dressed all in black, with the fur-lined hood of his coat pulled tightly over his head, the teenager is shown pointing the weapon at staff members during the raid . He also pointed the weapon at customers in the bank, after walking into the building brandishing the firearm and telling frightened cashiers: 'Don’t do anything stupid. I just got out of prison after five years. I’m not ****ing messing around.' The young thief then fled with more than £2,000. District Judge Ian Lomax told Liverpool Youth Court last month that the teenager was 'acting like a real-life action video game'. However, . Judge Clement Goldstone said 'it was not that sort of case at all' as the boy's . family would not allow him to watch 'inappropriate' television . programmes, films or video games. As the cashiers had filled a bag with money they added a 'dummy . bundle' which is designed to detonate and spray dye over the cash when . it leaves the building, Liverpool Crown Court heard. Caught on camera: The boy also can be seen to point the gun at customers during the raid . His mother found a stash of cash stained with dye and a fake firearm in his bedroom and turned him over to police. Kim Egerton, prosecuting, told . Liverpool Crown Court that after being questioned by family members the boy . admitted he had carried out a bank robbery. 'She . (his mother) had raised him to understand if he did something wrong . there would be consequences and though she loved her son it was the . right thing to do,' she said. The court was told that cashiers Steven Riley and Abbi Melling had been terrified. Raid: The boy burst into the Barclays Bank in Liverpool last month brandishing an imitation fire arm and demanded that staff hand over money . Robbery: The boy made off with more than £2,000 following the raid but was handed over to the police by his mother who was shocked to find a stash of cash, stained with dye, and a fake firearm in his bedroom . In a victim impact statement, Mr Riley said he had since found it difficult to sleep and had been having counselling to help him deal with the stress of what happened to him, as well as they worry that it could happen again.' He said that he was extremely afraid at the time when the gun was being pointed at him,' Miss Egerton said. Miss Melling said that during the raid she felt 'completely helpless'. 'She . was so scared she didn't even press the panic alarm,' Miss Egerton . said. The cashier said the raider did not appear scared and she thought . he was 'blase'. She said . she felt 'dread' and 'anxious' that it might happen to her again and . since the robbery she has been thinking it could happen again. Theresa Loftus, defending, said: 'The facts of this case are as striking as they are tragic.' She said the case was tragic for the victims of the defendant's crime, but also for his own family, who turned the boy in to the police when they had no other evidence against him. 'As such, my lord, the honesty, integrity, and decency of this family shone through by their actions on September 22 this year. They were instrumental in bringing this young man to justice,' Miss Loftus said, adding that they were 'brave and exceptional actions'. The boy's mother has been unable to work since due to stress, the court heard. The youngster was ordered to serve 40 months in a Young Offenders' Institution for carrying out the raid on September 20. Passing sentence, Judge Clement Goldstone QC, the Honorary Recorder of Liverpool, told the boy: 'However innocent you look now, as you sit in your smart suit, you did not look innocent when you held up bank staff at gunpoint and terrified them.' Ultra violent: An image from the video game Grand Theft Auto V. The robbery was carried out in the same week the game was released . Judge Goldstone said the teenager had planned the robbery at that particular branch because he thought it would be a 'soft touch'. The court heard that the boy wanted cash because he 'envied' the material possessions of his friends but also to reduce the financial burden on his family, who were having to pay for private tuition for him as his school grades were declining. The judge said the boy 'carried on with his young life as if nothing had happened' after the raid. 'Two days later, your mother found the money which you had hidden away, and then, later the same day, the gun,' the judge told him. 'It was your mother who bravely and in a remarkable display of public spirit decided to take you to the police station, despite you pleading with her not to.' Judge Goldstone said the actions of the boy's mother were 'all the more commendable' when he compared it to other cases where some parents were prepared to lie to protect their children when they knew they had committed serious crimes. He said he accepted the boy's remorse was genuine but that custody was necessary, not simply to punish the defendant but to 'show other boys that, if they choose to commit offences of this kind, they will be sent to detention'. The boy, who was said to have been doing well in school before his grades dipped this year, admitted two charges of robbery and one of possession of an imitation firearm, a realistic looking BB gun. Wearing a black suit, white . shirt and tie, he sat impassively in the dock as the sentence was passed. He looked briefly over to his mother and the rest of his family as he . was led down. Judge Goldstone refused to lift the boy’s anonymity, saying the family had 'been through enough'.","Boy stole £2,000 when he held up the Barclays Bank, in Liverpool .

"David Cameron has been accused of stoking 'kneejerk xenophobia' by a European commissioner over his 'unintelligent' accusations of benefit tourism among EU migrants. Responding to the Prime Minster's speech last week in which he vowed to restrict access to housing benefits and the NHS for those coming to the UK under EU free-movement rules, the European commissioner for employment, social affairs and inclusion, László Andor, told the Observer his claims were misleading. 'There is a serious risk of pandering to knee-jerk xenophobia,' he said. 'Blaming poor people or migrants for hardships at the time of economic crisis is not entirely unknown, but it is not intelligent politics in my view. David Cameron has come under attack from Euro commissioner Laszlo Andor (right) over his plans to restrict access to benefits to migrants from Europe. Mr Andor said the crackdown was 'unintelligent' 'I think it would be more responsible to confront mistaken perceptions about immigration from other EU countries and so-called ""benefit tourism"", and instead to explain the facts. 'The reality is that migrants from other EU countries are very beneficial to the UK's economy, notably because they help to address skills shortages and pay more tax and social security contributions per head, and get fewer benefits, than UK workers; that free movement of workers is a key part of the single market; that hundreds of thousands of UK nationals work in other EU countries.' The blistering response suggests Mr Cameron, who pledged to tighten residency tests for migrants from the EU and the wider European Economic Area, is heading for a confrontation with Brussels if and when he tries to secure agreement for such an approach with other member states. European law says that before EU citizens who are 'not active in the labour market'  become eligible for social security benefits, they have to pass a strict 'habitual residence test' proving they have a genuine link with the UK. Brussels says the tests are stringent at all levels and existing rules, agreed by the UK, prevent benefit tourism. The current tests are already the subject of legal disagreements between the UK government and the commission, which believes there are cases in which the UK is already breaching EU law, the paper reports. Former European commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson - now co-president of a cross-party campaign to promote a positive role for the UK in Europe called British Influence - also rejected the idea that citizens from EU states come here to 'sponge'. He said Britain needed workers when economic times were good and said the country would have to attract them again in the future, and added a similar number of Britons left the country to work in Europe. Critic: Former cabinet minister Peter Mandelson also weighed into the row, warning Mr Cameron Britain relies on immigrants from Europe for economic prosperity . In his speech, widely seen as a response to the rise of Ukip, Mr Cameron said 'ending the something-for-nothing culture is something that needs to apply in the immigration system as well as in the welfare system'. He pledged that 'by the end of this year and before the controls on Bulgarians and Romanians are lifted, we are going to strengthen the test that determines which migrants can access benefits'. He also said: 'We're going to give migrants from the EEA - from the European Economic Area - a very clear message. Just like British citizens, there is no absolute right to unemployment benefit. 'The clue is in the title: jobseeker's allowance is only available to those who are genuinely seeking a job.' Mr Andor added the commission had asked the British government on many occasions for evidence but none had been forthcoming.","PM blasted for his 'unintelligent' plans to restrict handouts for migrants .

"A boy of 15 who robbed a bank may have been acting out a video game, a judge said yesterday. The teenager burst into a branch of Barclays and pointed a fake handgun at terrified cashiers while demanding cash. He shouted: ‘I’m not f****** messing around – I’ve just got out of prison after five years’ before fleeing with £2,200. Crime scene: The teenager carried out the raid at a Barclays bank in Liverpool, on Friday . District judge Ian Lomax said the child may have been influenced by something he had ‘been watching or playing’. ‘It’s a bizarre, surreal case of a young man almost acting like a real-life action video game – nevertheless it was a robbery,’ the judge added. He said the case was very unusual because the boy was a model pupil who had not been in trouble with the police. Studies show ultra-violent games can lead to copycat behaviour among teenagers. Grand Theft Auto V, the latest game in a notorious series, was released last week to massive controversy. Despite its 18-rating critics say it will be played by millions of impressionable teenagers unprepared for graphic depictions of torture, murder and sex. Minutes after the game went on sale, . yobs mugged a fan who was one of the first to buy it, battering him over . the head with a brick and knifing him in the back. It . has also emerged that Aaron Alexis, the gunman who killed 12 people in a . rampage through a Washington naval base, was an obsessive player of . violent video games such as Call Of Duty and Resident Evil. Robbery: The boy made off with more than £2,000 following the raid but was handed over to the police by his mother who was shocked to find a stash of cash, stained with dye, and a fake firearm in his bedroom . Nicolas Robinson, associate professor in politics and video games research at the University of Leeds, said: ‘You do have to be 18 to buy Grand Theft Auto but do these games end up in the hands of kids who shouldn’t be playing them? The answer to that is absolutely yes. 'It's a bizarre, surreal case of a young man almost acting like a real-life action video game. Nevertheless it was a robbery' ‘Kids should be protected from certain content. I believe Grand Theft Auto is a very sophisticated satirical piece of work – and most kids under 18 just won’t get the satire. And if you don’t get the satire, it’s actually much more problematic than if you do.’ The Association of Teachers and Lecturers has carried out research suggesting video games are fuelling violence among primary school children. In the case of the young robber, Liverpool Youth Court heard he was confronted by his mother after she found the cash and the fake gun in his bedroom. He immediately admitted the crime and his family took him to the nearest police station where he made a confession. Ultra violent: An image from the video game Grand Theft Auto V . The boy, whose identity is protected by law, told officers he had staked out the Anfield bank before disguising himself in a hooded top and scarf around his face. However the money he took last Friday was stained by an anti-theft dye timed to explode when a robber leaves a bank. Debra Chan, prosecuting, said: ‘He wanted the money because he was jealous of other people who had material things he wanted.’ She added that he was a ‘model pupil, in the top set who attends every day’ and who was now facing a ‘substantial custodial sentence’. Although not injured, the two bank staff involved in the case were said to be traumatised by their ordeal. During his police interview, the boy apologised for what he had done. Esther Leach, defending, said: ‘He is doing fantastically well at school. He comes from a very, very good family.’ The boy pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery and one count of possessing an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence. His mother was in court and wept as he stepped into the dock wearing a black suit. Sending the case to Liverpool Crown Court for sentence, judge Lomax said the boy had been ‘motivated by greed and immaturity’. He added: ‘This is a very serious matter. It’s an armed robbery but not in the conventional sense most people would recognise. You knew with hindsight it was an imitation firearm but the tellers clearly didn’t know that and handed over cash in fear of being shot.’ The judge made no mention of any specific video games.

"The World Cup is over and, for the fourth time in history, Germany came out victorious after a 1-0 triumph over Argentina in the final.. There were some simply sublime displays in Brazil, with the likes of Javier Mascherano, James Rodriguez and Manuel Neuer all putting in a series of utterly imperious displays. But in much the same way as for every reaction, there is an equal and opposite reaction - in football for every brilliant player there is an equally terrible one. So who were the worst XI in Brazil? Here, Sportsmail runs the rule over eleven men who failed ever so badly in Brazil. WORLD CUP WORST XI (3-4-3)   IKER CASILLAS (Spain) – Had a blooper reel all of his own. The mis-control that gifted Robin van Persie a goal in the 5-1 defeat to Holland was the pick of the bunch. Nightmare: Iker Casilass endured a nightmare couple of games as Spain lost to Holland and Chile . PEPE (Portugal) – His tournament ended when he was sent off against Germany for stupidly thrusting his head into Thomas Mueller’s, leaving Portugal with 10 men for nearly an hour. They lost 4-0. Moment of madness: Pepe's headbutt on Thomas Muller in the Group G opener cost Portugal dearly . GERARD PIQUE (Spain) – The Barcelona defender suffered more than most in the shocking 5-1 defeat to Holland. Endured a torrid time and was not seen again. Passed by: Gerard Pique was destroyed in Spain's opener, before not being seen again in Brazil . DAVID LUIZ (Brazil) – Has a player’s stock ever fallen so rapidly? A contender for Team of the Tournament, Luiz’s world caved in as Brazil conceded 10 goals against Germany and Holland. Tearful: David Luiz was woeful in Brazil's horrendous 7-1 defeat to Germany in the semi-final . ANTONIO VALENCIA (Ecuador) – The Ecuador skipper had already been sent off against England in a pre-tournament friendly when he saw red for a late challenge in the final group game with France. No goals, no assists. Head in hands: Antonio Valencia leaves the pitch after receiving a red card against France . PAULINHO (Brazil) – The Tottenham man was utterly anonymous much of the time. At least his Brazil teammate Fernandinho kept himself occupied by kicking opponents. Chasing shadows: Paulinho was one of many Brazilian players who was poor throughout the tournament . WILSON PALACIOS (Honduras) – Set about France in the second group game like he wanted to be sent off and got his wish, conceding a penalty in the process. Why always me? Wilson Palacios was disappointing for Honduras in the group stage . EDEN HAZARD (Belgium) – Contributed two assists but we expected so much more from the Chelsea man. Did Jose Mourinho really say that he’s the best young player in the world? Underwhelming: Eden Hazard was disappointing  for Belgium in Brazil . LUIS SUAREZ (Uruguay) – No sooner had Suarez knocked out England than he was up to his old tricks, biting Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini. The striker was out of the World Cup and Uruguay weren’t far behind. Impact: Luis Suarez had a rather dramatic two games in Brazil against England and Italy . VIDEO Sorry Suarez admits Chiellini bite . FRED (Brazil) – Booed into retirement by his own fans, no-one summed up the dearth of Brazil’s attacking talent better than Fred. One goal against Cameroon was never going to be enough for his critics. Out of his depth: Fred simply couldn't cut it up front for Brazil . DIEGO COSTA (Spain) – All the talk, all the fuss, all that money Chelsea! Their £32m new signing showed why Spain sometimes prefer to play without a striker. Not worth the trouble: Diego Costa's impact in Brazil paled in comparison to the hype surrounding him beforehand .","Suarez, David Luiz and Diego Costa amongst those to feature in Worst XI .

"Former X Factor contestant Simone Battle was struggling with financial problems when she took her life, according to reports. The 25-year-old G.R.L. singer was found hanged in the closet of her West Hollywood apartment on Friday morning. The Los Angeles county coroner ruled her death a suicide. Friends and family have told authorities that Battle had been 'depressed over money issues', TMZ reported on Tuesday. The family said they didn't understand her money struggles because she was enjoying success with the girl group, including a collaboration with Pitbull, and had just finished a tour overseas. The group also performed on ABC's 'Good Morning America' last month. Loss: Simone Battle, 25, took her life in her Hollywood home last week after struggling with money woes, according to her family. Her breakout was in 2011's X Factor, right, where she made the final 17 . The family also reportedly told police that Battle had been worried she would never make it big. Battle, who was a finalist on the X Factor in 2011, was last seen alive at 3.45am on Friday - about four hours before her body was found, according to Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter. Her father Anthony Battle, who found her body, said his daughter had never showed any sign of depression, and said that they texted every day.

"A British terrorist has been linked to one of the worst disasters in CIA history. Omar al-Britani fought for the al-Qaeda and the Taliban before he was recently killed but has been linked to an attack in Afghanistan in 2009 that killed seven agents. In a video posted on jihadist websites, he is shown introducing notorious killer Abu Dujana in English, calling him 'my brother', according to The Sun. Triple agent: Abu Dujana, also known as Humam al-Balawi, posed as an informant for the CIA . Dujana, also known as Humam al-Balawi, carried out the attack at the CIA's Camp Chapman base in 2009 which killed seven agents and a Jordanian official. He successfully posed as a triple agent - working as an informer for both the CIA, the Jordanian government and the Taliban - to gain entry to the Afghanistan base where he detonated a suicide vest. Dujana managed to get into the CIA . base after arranging a meeting with the promise of information about the . location of al-Qaeda's number two Ayman Al Zawahiri. But once inside he detonated a suicide vest killing seven CIA agents and a Jordanian official. It was the deadliest attack on the CIA in 25 years and led to a report which was heavily critical of the agency's work in Afghanistan. One officer was quoted as branding US forces 'clueless' due to its lack of useful intelligence. In the video, Britani is seen gesturing towards Dujana, saying he is destined for martyrdom, The Sun reports.

"Authorities now say border patrol agent Nicolas Ivie, 30, who was shot dead during a shootout was a victim of friendly fire . A Border Patrol agent was shot to death Tuesday in Arizona near the U.S.-Mexico line, the first fatal shooting of an agent since a deadly 2010 firefight with Mexican bandits that spawned congressional probes of a botched government gun-smuggling investigation. The agent, Nicholas Ivie, 30, and a colleague were on patrol in the desert near Naco, Arizona, about 100 miles from Tucson, when shooting broke out shortly before 2am, the Border Patrol said. The second agent was shot in the ankle and buttocks, and was airlifted to a hospital. Authorities have not identified the agent who was wounded, nor did they say whether any weapons were seized at the site of the shooting. Mr Ivie is survived by a wife and two children. No arrests have been made in the shooting. Investigators suspect that more than one person fired at the agents. 'It was basically an ambush,' said Cochise county sheriff's commander Marc Denney. 'They had a little bit of a jump on . us. It is very rocky terrain. We're hoping that they hunkered down . somewhere close by so that we have an opportunity to find them.' Cochise . County Sheriff's Office and FBI, which are both investigating the . shooting, declined to say whether investigators have recovered guns or . bullet casings at the scene of the shooting. Authorities set up a checkpoint on a . dirt road about seven miles southeast of Bisbee. A Border Patrol truck . and another vehicle carrying two portable toilets were allowed to drive . past the roadblock. Tight lipped: As agents search for clues, the FBI would not confirm any details 'due to the sensitive and on-going nature of this investigation' The Tuscon Sentinel . cites a reporter from Fronteras Desk who claimed that two suspects have . been detained in Mexico though their identities have not been released. Agents . at the checkpoint declined to comment and barred reporters from going . further. Two helicopters from federal immigration agencies could be seen . from a distance circling the area. And a fugitive-chase team could be . seen staging on a roadside. The . area near the shooting is scattered with houses, trailers and . ranchettes. Mesquite trees and creosote bushes dotted the landscape, and . a mountain range stands nearby to the west. The U.S. government has put thousands . of sensors along the border that, when tripped, alert dispatchers that . they should send agents to a particular location. 'Smuggling country': Agents from multiple government agencies worked together on the search in the rugged countryside known as a 'smuggling corridor for many, many years' 'It’s a very rough area — it’s . mountainous, rocky, loose rock, low vegetation,' Cochise county . sheriff's commander Marc Denney told The Los Angeles Times. 'It’s . hard terrain to maneuver around. There’s not a lot of trail systems in . place. You’re just trying to work your way around and not turn an . ankle.' The . agents were fired upon in a rugged hilly area about five miles north of . the border as they responded to an alarm that was triggered on one of . the sensors, said sheriff's spokeswoman Carol Capas. It is not known whether the agents returned fire, Capas said. The wounded agent is in stable . condition and should be released from the hospital later Tuesday, said . George McCubbin, president of the National Border Patrol Council, a . union representing about 17,000 border patrol agents. The agents who . were shot were on patrol with a third agent, who was not harmed, . Mr McCubbin said. The Border Patrol said Ivie worked for the agency since January 2008 and grew up in Provo, Utah. Reeling: This is the first fatal shooting of a border patrol agent since 2010, as the only other deaths have due to car accidents . Shot at: The agents were fired upon in a rugged hilly area about five miles north of the border as they responded to an alarm that was triggered on one of the sensors installed to alert possible breaches . The last Border Patrol agent fatally . shot on duty was Brian Terry, who died in a shootout with bandits near . the border in December 2010. The Border Patrol station in Naco, where . the two agents shot Tuesday were stationed, was recently named after . Terry. Terry's shooting was . later linked to the government's Fast and Furious gun-smuggling . operation, which allowed people suspected of illegally buying guns for . others to walk away from gun shops with weapons, rather than be . arrested. Prior to Tuesday's attack, the most recent fatality was Leopoldo Cavazos Jr. who died on July 6 due to injuries from an ATV accident near Fort Hancock, Texas.James Dominguez was killed on July 19 when he was killed by a passing vehicle while helping stranded motorists in Cline, Texas.Both Hector Clark and his partner agent Eduardo Rojas Jr. were killed when their patrol car was hit by a freight train near Gila Bend, Arizona.The case that has drawn the most publicity in recent years was that of agent Brian Terry, . whose shooting death on December 15, 2010, during a sting operation . shed light on the government's 'Fast and Furious' plan to track gun . trafficking between the U.S.-Mexico border. Authorities intended to track the guns into Mexico. Two rifles found at the scene of Terry's shooting were bought by a member of the gun-smuggling ring being investigated. Critics of the operation say any shooting along the border now will raise the specter those illegal weapons are still being used in border violence. 'There's no way to know at this point how the agent was killed, but because of Operation Fast and Furious, we'll wonder for years if the guns used in any killing along the border were part of an ill-advised gun-walking strategy,' Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said in a written statement. The Terry family said that the . shooting was a 'graphic reminder of the inherent dangers that threaten . the safety of those who live and work near the border.' Twenty-six Border Patrol agents have died in the line of duty since 2002. Bisbee-area . residents expressed a mix of concern and frustration about the . shooting, along with recognition that the border can be a dangerous . place. The region has seen . its share of violence in recent years, including the Terry shooting and . the slaying of a well-known rancher in 2010. That killing is, in part, . credited with pushing Arizona lawmakers to pass a law that requires . officers, when they stop someone, to check the immigration status of . those they suspect are in the country illegally. 'There is no security on the border - none,' said Edward L. Thomas, who owns rental properties in Bisbee.",Two agents shot at the border during firefight with Mexican bandits .
"An telescope monitoring the moon has captured the moment a 40kg rock slammed into the lunar surface creating a bright flash of light. The explosion on March 17 was the biggest seen since NASA began watching the moon for meteoroid impacts about eight years ago. So far, more than 300 strikes have been recorded. 'It exploded in a flash nearly 10 times as bright as anything we've ever seen before,' Bill Cooke, with NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, said in a statement. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The telescope captured the moment a 40kg rock slammed into the moon creating a bright flash (pictured) A NASA satellite orbiting the moon is now on a hunt for the newly formed crater, which scientists estimate could be as wide as 20 meters. The flash was so bright that anyone looking at the moon at the moment of impact could have seen it without a telescope, NASA said. After reviewing digital recordings made by one of the program's telescopes, scientists determined the space rock was about 1ft (0.3 meters) in diameter, and traveling about 56,000 mph when it slammed into the moon and exploded with the force of five tons of TNT. That same night, cameras detected an unusually high number of meteors blasting through Earth's atmosphere as well. Most meteors burn up well before reaching the ground. NASA's lunar monitoring program has captured hundreds of meteoroid impacts on the moon. The brightest was detected on March 17 which is marked with a red square . But not always. In February, an asteroid estimated to be about 66ft (20 meters) in diameter exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, damaging buildings and shattering glass, leaving more than 1,500 injured. It was the largest object to strike Earth since 1908. 'The Russian fireball was many orders of magnitude larger and possessed 100,000 times more energy,' than the lunar impact, Cooke said. He believes the lunar impact and the March 17 meteor shower on Earth are related, the result of both bodies traveling together through a region of space sprinkled with small rocks and dust. 'We'll be keeping an eye out for signs of a repeat performance next year when the Earth-moon system passes through the same region of space,' Cooke said.","Explosion happened on March 17 and was the biggest seen by NASA .

"After four years, over $1 million in medical costs and dozens of blood transfusions and skin grafts, a Michigan woman says she has recovered from not only one but two rare spider bites that nearly cost her her leg. Bedridden and warned of potentially losing her leg, Jane Hefferan of Dearborn, Michigan said she would have never guessed that a single spider bite would end the way it did, but neither did her doctors. 'It was eating up so much of my leg, and so much of my tissue was gone,' Ms Hefferan who had just graduated from Vanderbilt University when first bitten told Click on Detroit. 'At that point there was like nothing left of my leg. It was just basically bone.' Mending: Jane Hefferan is seen during her recovery after a brown recluse spider bit her leg requiring over 20 surgeries that cut dead tissue away straight to the bone . It was in the summer of 2008 after graduating from law school that doctors believe a poisonous brown recluse spider crawled into her bed in Nashville - how experts say 38 per cent of brown recluse bites occur. Primarily known throughout parts of the southeast, though capable of spreading elsewhere, the spider's bite immediately puffed up her knee but she shoved it off as related to a previous running injury than something far more serious. It was her physical therapist who realized it was something more. 'The physical therapist looked at it and he's like, ""You need to go to the emergency room,' she said. 'I immediately said that no, it wasn't a spider bite. It couldn't possibly be. I had no idea that a spider could do something like that,' she said. Wounded: Ms Hefferan's knee is seen before it was stripped of dead tissue after a single spider bite hospitalized her during the course of over 20 surgeries . Brutal fight: Ms Hefferan shows off one of several painful skin grafts she underwent after they refused to take . Double trouble: Adding to her horrific fight, just after beginning treatment on her knee doctors discovered a second, newly sustained bite on her other leg . Before what would accumulate to over 20 . surgeries, over 50 units of blood transfusions and multiple skin grafts, . Ms Hefferan spent her first day in surgery, stripping the first layers . of dead tissue from her knee. 'The . initial surgery was just to cut out all of the necrotic or dead tissue . that the spider had destroyed,' Ms Hefferan said. 'It was on the side of . my knee. They cut down basically to the lining of the bone.' What could only make matters worse, however, was news of a second bite found during her . recovery on her other leg, . adding to her student health insurance running out a month after the first treatment. Working in overdrive, doctors said the bites triggered an auto-immune disease called pyoderma gangrenosum, according to the Dearborn Free Press, that caused large, painful sores that weren't healing. Culprit: A poisonous brown recluse spider is seen, primarily found in southeastern states with the adults growing up to the size of a quarter . 'It kept opening up, and I was having a lot of bleeding. The graft wasn't taking. They ended up doing another graft which didn't take. And then they ended up doing a third graft, at which point they kept me in the hospital on complete bed rest,' she said. 'Something so small, something that I could have stepped on and killed, could cause all of this,' she said this week of her disbelief. As the law school graduate documented . her recovery on her Facebook page, showing her painful skin graphs and . the large amount of blood loss sustained from her open wounds, she . reached out to friends and her community for help. She asked that anyone who could donate blood would. '...its [sic] sad that I had never . donated blood until now. But from now on, I will donate as often as I . can!' a friend of hers wrote on her Facebook page showing a photo of a . red wristband printed ‘For Jane.’ Further coming to her aid, with some of . her hospital stays costing she said around $300,000-400,000, friends in . Dearborn held fundraisers and blood drives in her name and Vanderbilt . University Medical Center provided her with several months of charitable . treatment. Blood loss: With immense blood loss from her surgeries and open wounds, Ms Hefferan reached out to friends back home in Dearborn, Michigan for help donating . Inspired: Despite having passed her bar exam following graduation, Ms Hefferan says her experience has inspired her to go back to school for nursing . 'After over 1300+ days my knee is finally healed!!! Too bad I think my days as a leg model might be over,' she posted with a picture of her knee late last month. And throughout all of her work toward recovery coupled with studying, Ms Hefferan said she passed the bar exam. On to bigger and better things, Ms Hefferan said that despite her academic accomplishments, her experience has inspired her to change career paths. 'I'm now going back to school and hope to start a nursing program next fall,' she told Click on Detroit. While her injuries sustained by the bites were deemed unusually severe by her doctors - with 90 per cent of brown recluse bites healing on their own and only 3 per cent requiring skin grafts, according to a University of California, Riverside researcher speaking to ABC - she hopes to use her experience as a patient advocate after receiving a nursing degree. Until then, she's busy warning others as a model to immediately seek treatment if a bite is suspected.","Jane Hefferan underwent at least 20 surgeries, dozens of blood transfusions and several skin grafts during her four year recovery .

"The scandal of MPs enjoying extravagant expenses might seem like an indictment of the modern politician. But the identity of the very first commoners sent to Parliament can be revealed by a new book only because they too pocketed public money for their time and travel more than 700 years ago. And the desperate scrabble of today's politicians to submit claims is also centuries old, with Parliament inundated with hundreds of complaints for not paying out enough. This is one of the earliest parliamentary expense claims, dating from 1309, and paid out to Fulk Peyferer, who also attended the first Parliament in 1258 . King Henry III ordered that four knights from every county, and six from Yorkshire, attend the first Parliament . In the mid-13th century, Henry III was forced to accept a new form of government and agreed under the so-called Provisions of Oxford to convene a king’s council to deal with affairs of the realm and ‘legitimate local grievances’. He ordered that knights from different parts of the country would report back to a Parliament on problems they had come across. In all 150 knights were appointed, four from each county and six from Yorkshire. Some were too ill to travel, others were deemed ‘not fit’ and replaced. But records unearthed by Labour MP Chris Bryant show that at least 14 did attend the very first ‘parliament’ in London in 1258 – and they all claimed expenses. In an eerie echo of the 2009 scandal that rocked Parliament, the expenses offered were over generous to make sure the MPs turned up. Knights were offered 4 shillings-a-day, including for their travel from every corner of the country - twice the rate for going to war. The first Parliament came about after Henry III was forced by his  barons to implement the Provisions of Oxford . According to Chris Bryant's research, at least 14 names were record on the very first expense claim for attending Parliament in October 1258. They were: . According to Mr Bryant’s new book, Parliament: The Biography, the names on the claims include Fulk Peyferer, Mauger le Vavasour and William de Iseny. The details were revealed in the ‘partially illegible gall-spattered Close Rolls of November 1258 show that the “reasonable expenses of coming and returning” to the Michaelmas council were met for the knights from at least ten counties’. Mr Bryant said: ‘I started this book because I wanted to know who the very first commoners were who came to Parliament – people whose names we have and know they actually attended. ‘I found a list in the National Archives, it’s all on velum, from October 1258. ‘That has 14 names of people coming from Kent, Yorkshire and so on. The only reason we know they came is because they had their expenses paid.’ Britain’s oldest expenses form was also unearthed, dating from 1309, which included claims by Bartholomew de Badlesmere, and Fulk Peyferer, who appears to have claimed for several decades. 'The King was so keen to have impressive and important knights to come to Parliament that whereas he would pay two shillings to go to war, he paid four shillings for coming to Parliament each day, including every day they were travelling. That was quite a hefty amount in those days. ‘From 1377 to 1505 there were 119 disputed  cases, mainly where people weren’t pay what they should have been paid.’ The successor body, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, is still bombarded with complaints from MPs today about their claims. They can still claim for rail, road and air travel, including being reimbursed for cycling on official duties. But since the 2009 scandal they are no longer able to claim for mortgages, extravagant shopping sprees on furniture or eating out when Parliament is sitting. Labour MP Chris Bryant unearthed the very first expense claims while researching his book Parliament: A Biography . By CHRIS BRYANT . A highly significant provision of the Oxford settlement was that the king’s council would deal not only with affairs ‘of the realm and of the king’, but also with legitimate local grievances. To this end the Oxford council resolved that knights (rather than magnates or clerics) be appointed to investigate problems in each county and report back to ‘parliament’ later in the year. So, on 4 August 1258, Henry wrote to the sheriffs of the thirty-seven counties of England, sending to each a list of local knights from which a number were to be chosen ‘to enquire touching excesses, trespasses and injuries committed in that county, and to bring their inquisition personally to Westminster by the octave of Michaelmas, for delivery to the council’. In all bar one county four knights were nominated, but for Yorkshire there were six, giving a neat total of 150. Not all those originally summoned were to make it to Westminster. Peter de Montfort (no relation to Simon), who had presided over the Oxford meeting, sent word that three of the Shropshire knights were ‘not fit’; so they were replaced. And when the sheriff of Devon pointed out that two of his were sick he was allowed to appoint substitutes. We can, however, be certain that some of them did attend the parliament, for the partially illegible gall-spattered Close Rolls of November 1258 show that the ‘reasonable expenses of coming and returning’ to the Michaelmas council were met for the knights from at least ten counties. In the cases of Lincoln and York the knights who attended are named – and are the same as those summoned in August. A further seven counties’ knights seem to have arrived later, as their expenses were also met, and again in the case of Huntingdon the names of the attendant knights are the same as those summoned.","King Henry III ordered 150 knights to convene first 'parliament' in 1258 .

"Russell Slade's position as Leyton Orient boss remains tenuous after admitting he wants to better himself, days after an approach from Cardiff City. Slade saw his side knocked out of the Capital One Cup to Sheffield United last night thanks to Michael Higdon's early header, and if it was to be his last match in charge at The Matchroom Stadium, the goal marked a disappointing end to a four-and-a-half year project. Cardiff's approach was rejected, but Slade admitted he is frustrated not to be in the Championship after Orient came so close in the play-offs.

Subs not used: Turner, Scougall, McNulty, Davies, McEvely . Goals: Higdon (2) Booked: Murphy, Flynn . Attendance: 3,223 . Man of the match: Wallace (Sheffield United) He said: 'Everybody wants to better themselves, when you've been in League One a few years and came so close in May to getting ourselves in the Championship, it's frustrating. 'It's a big club, and it will be a big job for somebody. 'I love this football club. I've had four-and-a-half years, 230 odd games.' Slade's comments after Orient's win at Scunthorpe on Saturday - that he felt 'proud' to be linked with the Cardiff job - were sure to unsettle. Sheffield United duly took advantage on the pitch. They were given joy down the left twice in the opening two minutes, and scored at the second attempt. Higdon's hold up play allowed Jamie Murphy free, and his perfect cross was headed past Gary Woods by the man who started the move. Chances were sparse, but Elliot Omozusi hit the post for Orient with a deflected effort, before Stephen McGinn pulled his effort just wide at the other end. As Sheffield United embark on another cup run, Orient are still looking for their first home win of the season. Slade's future is uncertain, but Orient owner Franceso Bechetti's programme notes were telling, revealing he had been asked by a lawyer to allow Slade to transfer to Cardiff, a request he rejected. Few would begrudge Slade a move up a division when his job seemed at risk a fortnight ago due to a slow start to the League One campaign.

"A flight engineer who was a passenger on the missing Malaysia Airlines plane is being investigated as the suspicion that it was hijacked hardens. The aviation engineer is Mohd Khairul Amri Selamat, 29, a Malaysian who has said on social media he had worked for a private jet charter company. The pilots are also under intense scrutiny, after it was revealed that the co-pilot said  'all right, good night', after someone had begun disabling one of the plane's automatic tracking systems. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Probe: Malaysia police are investigating the background of Mohd Khairul (above), a flight engineer on board MH370 . Loved ones: Erny Khairul, whose husband Mohd Khairul Amri Selamat was onboard the missing Malaysia Airlines flight . Painful wait: Malaysian Selamat Omar shows pictures of his son, Mohd Khairul Amri Selamat . Malaysian investigators are trawling . through the backgrounds of the pilots, crew and ground staff who worked . on the missing Boeing 777-200ER for clues as to why someone on board . flew it hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of miles off course. ‘Yes, we are looking into Mohd Khairul as well as the other passengers and crew. The focus is on anyone else who might have had aviation skills on that plane,’ a senior police official with knowledge of the investigations told Reuters. As he's investigated, his wife, Emy, waits in hope. Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference Monday that finding the plane was still the main focus, and he did not rule out finding it intact. 'The fact that there was no distress signal, no ransom notes, no parties claiming responsibility, there is always hope,' Hishammuddin said. No trace of the plane has been found more than a week after it vanished but investigators believe it was diverted by someone with deep knowledge of the plane and of commercial navigation. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Saturday evidence pointed to a deliberate diversion of the flight, given the controlled way it was apparently turned around and flown far to the west of its original route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. CCTV footage captures Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, pilot of the Boeing 777 flight, being frisked while walking through security at Kuala Lumpar International Airport . Artists express hope: Students gather around a three dimensional artwork, based on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, that was painted on a school ground in Makati city.

Thoughts and prayers: Children write a message at the Wall of Hope for the passengers of the missing Malaysian Airlines plane at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia . A flight engineer is responsible for overseeing systems on a plane during flights to confirm they are working correctly and to make repairs if necessary. As an engineer specializing in executive jets, Khairul would not necessarily have all the knowledge needed to divert and fly a large jetliner. Khairul had said he worked for a Swiss-based jet charter firm called Execujet Aviation Group, but the company declined to say whether it still employed him. In a picture posted on Khairul's Facebook account in 2011, he identified himself as an employee of Execujet's Malaysian operations.

He declined to say whether he believed his son could have been involved in any foul play. Possible last known position of MH370 . Selamat said he and other family members were supposed to visit Khairul's new house this month. But Khairul had told his father on Thursday he had to go for a job in Beijing and that they would reschedule. That was the last time they spoke. ‘Khairul was doing well in his job and was a good son. He would come visit us at least once a month,’ Selamat said.

These words from the cockpit of the missing plane were spoken - believed to be by co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid - as it was leaving Malaysian-run airspace and being handed over to air traffic controllers in Vietnam. The sign-off came after one of the plane's data communication systems, which would have enabled it to be tracked beyond radar coverage, had been switched off, Malaysia's Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said on Sunday. The informal hand-off went against standard radio procedures, which would have called for him to read back instructions for contacting the next control centre and include the aircraft's call sign, said Hugh Dibley, a former British Airways pilot and a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society. Investigators are likely to examine the recording for any signs of psychological stress.","Police probing MH370 passengers with technical knowledge of planes .

"A British yachtswoman believes she saw a burning aircraft over the Indian Ocean on the night that flight MH370 vanished. Katherine Tee, 41, from Liverpool, described spotting what looked like a jet with ‘orange lights’ and trailing a plume of smoke. Her claims add to mystery surrounding the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777, which disappeared on March 8 after leaving Kuala Lumpur. The 41-year-old, who had been at sea for about 13 months with her husband, had kept the spotting of the plane to herself as she was unaware of its significance at the time. Scroll down for video . British sailor Katherine Tee says she was crossing the Indian Ocean en route to Phuket, Thailand when she saw what appeared to be a plane that was on fire with black smoke trailing behind it - possibly on the night Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 went missing . But now, she's decided to break her . silence and has filed an official report with authorities which could . become a new lead into the search for the long lost jet. Ms Tee said she thought she was ‘mad’ when she spotted the fiery object in the night sky while sailing from Cochin, India with husband Marc Horn, 50. She was alone on deck when she saw the aircraft. 'I was on a night watch. My husband was asleep below deck and our one other crew member was asleep on deck,' she told the Phuket Gazette. 'I saw something that looked like a plane on fire. That's what I thought it was. Then, I thought I must be mad… It caught my attention because I had never seen a plane with orange lights before, so I wondered what they were. Ocean fireball: Katherine Tee and husband Marc Horn . 'I could see the outline of the plane, it looked longer than planes usually do. There was what appeared to be black smoke streaming from behind it.' Ms Tee, from Liverpool, said two other planes were visible in the night sky. 'There were two other planes passing well above it – moving the other way – at that time. They had normal navigation lights. I remember thinking that if it was a plane on fire that I was seeing, the other aircraft would report it,' she said. 'And then, I wondered again why it had such bright orange lights. They reminded me of sodium lights. I thought it could be some anomaly or just a meteor. 'It was approaching to cross behind our stern from the north. When I checked again later, it had moved across the stern and was moving away to the south.' Ms Tee explained that she kept her observance to herself as the long voyage had taken a toll on her marriage. She . hadn't spoken to her husband for about a week and it wasn't until she . arrived in Phuket on March 10 that she first heard of the MH370 tragedy. Ms Tee said she told local yachties what she thought she had seen. 'Some . suggested I should say something, that [what I saw] might have been it. Most said that the flight was heading toward Vietnam. I wasn't sure of . the date or time [of the sighting]. I am still not,' she said. 'I . did think that what I saw would add little, and be dismissed with the . thousands of other sightings that I assumed were being reported. I . thought that the authorities would be able to track [the plane's] GPS . log, which I assumed was automatically transmitted, or something like . that. The 41-year-old had been at sea for 13 months sailing from Cochin, India to Phuket, Thailand with her husband Marc Horn, 50, and their pet dog . A map showing the projected flight path of MH370 crossing the yacht astern. This is just how Ms Tee had remembered which then convinced her to file a report . 'Most of all, I wasn't sure of what I saw. I couldn't believe it myself, and didn't think anyone would believe me when I was having trouble believing my own eyes. 'I didn't even consider putting out a Mayday at the time. Imagine what an idiot I would have looked like if I was mistaken, and I believed I was. So I dismissed it, and got on with the business of fixing myself and my marriage.' It was only when she heard some news on a radio report last Saturday explaining that a survey ship involved in the search for MH370 was returning to port due to technical problems. This is what prompted Ms Tee to tell her husband and then began reviewing her yacht's log. Husband Marc Horn posted complete tracking data of the couple's journey across the Andaman on yachting website Cruisers Forum after his wife told him of her sighting . More tracking data of Marc and Katherine's voyage across the Andaman. The couple reported Ms Tee's sighting on Saturday . 'That is when we checked our GPS log and realised that perhaps I really did see it,' she said. Mr Horn posted data maps of the yacht's course across the sea on yachting website Cruisers Forum. It was then discovered that the couple's 40-foot vessel was near one of the projected flight paths for MH370. The flight path was estimated during the initial search period, after experts realised that Malaysian defense forces had discovered a 'ping' that could have been the lost aircraft. A map was created by Cruisers Forum member 'europaflyer' by using Google Earth to show the yacht's position compared with the projected flightpath for MH370. The map unveiled that the plane would have passed the yacht astern from port to starboard, which is just as Ms Tee had recalled. 'This is what convinced me… to file a report with the full track data for our voyage to the relevant authorities,' she said. The couple filed the report with the Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) on Saturday and the Australian organisation tasked with co-ordinating the search for MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean. They also followed up with a second email to the JACC on Sunday. Since doing so, Ms Tee wishes she had acted sooner. 'Will this help the authorities of the families get closure? I have no idea. All I can confirm is that I have since learnt that we were in the right place at the right time, so it seems possible, but I chose to sweep it under the carpet and now I feel really bad,' she said. 'Maybe I should have had a little more confidence in myself. I am sorry I didn't take action sooner.' No confirmation has been released by the JACC that they've received the report. It is unknown whether or not the search body will investigate these claims.","British sailor Katherine Tee says she saw what appeared to be a plane that was on fire with black smoke trailing behind it .

"Liverpool target Dele Alli has signed a new contract with MK Dons. The midfielder - who was born in Milton Keynes and made his debut for the club aged 16 - has attracted the interest of England's top clubs and was part of the MK Dons' side that beat Manchester United 4-0 in the Capital One Cup.

"Auction: The best-selling author is to put her jewellery up for sale at Bonhams in December . Barbara Taylor Bradford is selling her jewellery collection to provide a nest egg for two distant relatives. The 80-year-old author of A Woman Of Substance, who has no children, is auctioning diamond rings, ornate brooches, necklaces and bracelets – most of which were presents from her husband Bob. She initially thought of giving the 40-item collection, which is expected to raise almost £1.5million, to the two women, who are described as ‘wider family members’. But she came to the conclusion that the gems are not something they would want or wear ‘as they don’t lead the same lifestyle as me’. A 14-carat diamond ring has been valued at almost £500,000 and a pair of Harry Winston diamond and pearl earrings is expected to fetch up to £75,000 in the sale at Bonhams in London on December 5. She explained that much of . her jewellery remains in a drawer at her penthouse home in New York. She said: ‘My . father told me when I was a child, after he gave me a string of pearls: . “You must always let them breath. They should be out on your neck, not . buried in a drawer.” 'Why was all this buried in a drawer?, Well, I didn’t know. ‘Then I . realised I was going to leave that jewellery to two of our female . heirs. They didn’t really want it, I don’t think, because they don’t . really lead the kind of life that I lead as a well-known writer, and I’m . out and about. ‘So Bob . and I decided it might be nice to auction it and the money will be a . little nest egg for them. Let somebody else enjoy those beautiful . things.’ Miss Taylor . Bradford has said she does not want to disclose the identities of the . two women, although it is possible they are descendants of her aunt Mary . and uncle Fred. A recent . ITV programme, Secrets from the Workhouse, showed the author . extensively researching her family history, while she was also shocked . to learn in 2004 that her mother, along with aunt and uncle, may have . been the illegitimate children of the Marquess of Ripon.

Miss Taylor Bradford, who has sold over 88 million books in more than . 90 countries, said that most of the items were presents from her . husband, a television producer with whom she celebrates her 50th wedding . anniversary on Christmas Eve this year. ‘I happen to have a very generous husband, and he’s really bought everything that is going on auction,’ she added. ‘I . did say: “Is that alright? Are you agreeing to this?” And he said “Yes, . of course. I bought it, but I gave it to you and it’s yours and you can . do what you like with it”. ‘When . I look at those things and when I was going back in time, because we . are coving the 80s and the 90s, a lot of the memories of how he gave the . piece to me sprang in to my mind. 'I . was very amused and very happy because I remember once for instance we . were in vacation in Capri and I was reading on the terrace after . breakfast and he said: “I’m just going for a walk to buy a newspaper”. Antique: A cushion-shape sapphire ring (left) is expected to fetch up to £131,000.

Taylor Bradford and her husband have never had children. The couple . have tried to start a family in the past, but the author has admitting . having two miscarriages. ‘I . had two miscarriages and never got pregnant again,’ she said. ‘But . regrets are fruitless and you don’t miss a child you’ve never known.

"A woman who gets teased by her daughter for her Teesside accent and dialect has created a Smoggie dictionary to help her friends understand her. Nichola Ridley, 25, who grew up in Middlesbrough and moved nearly 40 miles away to Gateshead five years ago, says she still finds herself having to repeat words because people are not familiar with her dialect. Now, Miss Ridley, who runs her own cleaning business, has compiled a list of Teesside words with translations into Standard English on her blog - and has had responses from all over the world from homesick expats. Scroll down for video . Nichola Ridley, 25, moved from her native Middlesbrough to Gateshead and has written her own Smoggie Dictionary to help friends understand the differences between the two dialects . 'I often have to repeat myself in the . shop or in the taxi or wherever and there's loads of things I don't . quite get that people say here, despite living on Tyneside for five . years,' she said. Smoggie is a nickname for people from Teesside that was coined because of the industrial nature of the area. It was first used as a derogatory term, but now many people proudly call themselves Smoggies, including supporters of Middlesbrough FC and local MP Tom Blenkinsop, who used it in a parliamentary speech in 2011. Miss Ridley's daughter, Emily Rose, seven, has grown up in Dunston, Gateshead and the pair have fun comparing the differences between their dialects, with Emily Rose even recording a video for the blog to show what she means. 'My little girl mocks me and makes me say ""bird"" and ""bed"" in my accent because she says they sound exactly the same,' she said. Within two days of publishing the post in her Bridget in the North blog, inspired by Bridget Jones's Diary, it had been viewed more than 60,000 times and shared more than 10,000 on Facebook. Miss Ridley said: 'I wrote it and it just exploded all over the place. Miss Ridley post on her Bridget of the North blog has been viewed more than 60,000 times since she published it three days ago . 'I have had people from Australia and Thailand and all over sending me messages saying the dictionary makes them homesick.' Miss Ridley says her favourite saying is 'now then', meaning 'hello'. 'People up here have no idea what you mean and say, ""ah, you mean 'Aal reet,""' she said. 'Some of the dictionary isn't actual words, it's things like we might say ""tortured"" meaning ""pester"", whereas up here it's the more serious word. 'The other thing is we'd say, ""shot us that over here"", for 'throw that over here. 'Up here, they'd say ""hoy it ower here"".'

"UKIP is bidding to make history on Thursday by winning its first Commons seat in the Newark by-election. The contest follows the resignation of the town’s former Conservative MP Patrick Mercer over a ‘cash-for-access’ scandal. If Nigel Farage’s candidate, Roger Helmer, overturns the Tories’ 16,000 majority at the last Election, it will cause an even bigger  shock than Ukip’s Euro election triumph. In the words of Farage, the Ukip fox will finally be let loose in the Westminster hen-house. The stakes are equally high for David Cameron. If Conservative Robert Jenrick wins, the Prime Minister can claim to have stopped Mr Farage’s ‘People’s Army’ in its tracks. If he loses, the prospect of continuing Ukip support giving Ed Miliband the key to No 10  at the next Election will be all the more likely. ROGER HELMER . Tory defector who says nobody was offended by previous MP's notorious 'black b*******' gaffe . Nigel Farage may be Britain’s best-known politically incorrect politician, but not for long if Ukip’s Roger Helmer wins the Newark by-election. His views on immigration, gays, Catholic priests and same-sex marriage make Farage seem almost progressive. Nearly as colourful are the brown-checked jacket, cream slacks and  red-brown shoes he is wearing for  our interview at a Starbucks cafe in Newark town square. Unabashed: Roger Helmer, the candidate in this Thursday's parliamentary by-election in Newark . Mr Helmer, who defected from the Conservatives two years ago and is now a Ukip Euro MP, doesn’t actually scoff when I suggest immigration has had benefits too, but his five-word reply, ‘I like Indian restaurants too’, speaks for itself. A jaunty 70, his moustache and dandyish wardrobe give him a ‘Terry Thomas’-like air. In the mouth of the BNP’s Nick Griffin, Mr Helmer’s words would sound vile, but like Mr Farage, he is so chirpy and brazen it is harder to take offence. He supports the repatriation of immigrants to their native countries. Pruned image: Farage is seen as un-PC, but he's nothing compared to his candidates . ‘If someone says, “I came here, gave it a try, don’t like it, can’t stand the weather, I’d really like to go back to Pakistan but I can’t afford to go.” I’d have no objection to taxpayers’ money being used to assist them – but not forcibly,’ he adds quickly. Would the idea of a black or Muslim Prime Minister of Britain upset him? ‘I wouldn’t panic,’ he says. ‘We had a woman Prime Minister and I rather liked that!’ You can almost hear the ‘arf arf Rog’ at the golf club bar as he replies. He insists he is ‘fairly relaxed’ about gays, but maintains homophobia  does not exist and accuses ‘strident’ gay rights groups of using it for political ends. ‘Phobia is well defined in psychiatry – get a definition of it,’ he barks. ‘We [Ukip] don’t deny there’s prejudice against minorities, and we condemn it. However, it isn’t a phobia. When people say “we support traditional marriage”, Stonewall says, “Homophobia, homophobia”. It’s a perfectly respectable position to take, it doesn’t require abuse and isn’t a phobia.’ Helmer says the NHS should be allowed to spend money on helping homosexuals become straight. He says it is no different to NHS sex-change operations and, bizarrely, compares it to homeopathy. ‘One person is unhappy with their physical sex and wants to change it and we say, “OK you can do it.” ‘You have a homosexual who  says, “I’m homosexual, actually  I’d rather be straight, is there a way of fixing it?” We say to the person who wants to change from a man to a woman or vice versa, “Please do that on the NHS.” We say to this guy, “That’s wicked, you’re not allowed to think about it.” ’ ‘I don’t know if homeopathy works or not, but I will defend the right of anyone who believes it works to  try it.’ He insists he is ‘taking a libertarian view’. He opposes same-sex marriage. ‘Marriage is defined by history, culture and reproductive biology and deserves special respect in society. (I am) perfectly relaxed about other relationships but they don’t justify the same respect.’ Resigned: Tory MP Patrick Mercer, pictured, was alleged to have asked questions in Parliament for money . And he claims the Catholic Church is ‘systematically paedophile’. ‘It’s fact. I’m sure the Pope is a nice man. If a few people in the Met Police are racist, people say it is institutionally racist; if hundreds of Catholic priests are paedophiles and I say they’re paedophile, it’s terrible.’ Ex-Newark Tory MP and former Army officer Mercer caused uproar when he said being called a ‘black b******’ was a normal part  of Army life. Helmer leaps to his defence. ‘Nobody was offended. Get real. What’s that line from Kipling? “Single men in barracks don’t grow into plaster saints.” ’ Mr Helmer’s critics say he is more sinner than saint. He won’t care if he wins in Newark on Thursday.

'I wouldn't panic' ROBERT JENRICK . Christie's director with top lawyer wife - they make no apologies for working hard for their money . Tory candidate Robert Jenrick rejects claims that he has covered up his and his wife’s £5 million property portfolio and £500,000-a-year joint earnings to try to win  the Newark seat. Mr Jenrick presents himself as a ‘father, local man, son  of a secretary and small businessman and state primary school-educated’ candidate. But that is not quite the whole story. In fact, he and American wife Michal own not one, but two, £2 million homes in London and a £1 million country pile built by an 18th Century slave-trader. Their Newark ‘home’ is a  rented house obtained when he was picked as a candidate six months ago. And his Party CV omits to say he went to a £13,000-a-year private secondary school. Together with his director’s  job at Christie’s auction house, it is just the type of posh Tory boy image Cameron and co can’t shrug off. Opponent: Robert Jenrick (left) and his Marylebone flat (right), one of two £2million London homes he owns . Mr Jenrick, who looks even younger than his 32 years, sticks rigidly to his Tory HQ autocue when asked about national issues. During our interview at a cafeteria in Tuxford, near Newark, he is finally stirred when I ask whether, in his keenness to come across as a regular guy, he has misled voters. To win the candidacy, he promised he would move his family lock, stock and barrel to Newark. A 250-mile round-trip  to Westminster if he becomes  MP – quite a commute for a  self-proclaimed family man  with two young daughters. Wealthy: The Westminster home owned by Robert Jenrick . How many nights has the family actually spent in their Newark ‘home?’ ‘Er, it has grown over time.’  He won’t say. His election leaflets are also silent about the couple’s £2 million flat in Marylebone, London. It went up in value by £300,000 last year, more than twice the average price of a home in Newark. Last October, the couple splashed out an extra £2.5 million on a house in fashionable Vincent Square, Westminster, less than a mile from Parliament, which  they plan to move into soon. On top of that they bought Grade I listed Eye Manor in Herefordshire for £1.1 million  in 2009. Mr Jenrick says he is ‘almost sure’ they will sell it and move to Newark if he becomes MP. It is to be hoped this interview is not the first Mrs Jenrick, a top commercial lawyer whose professional name is Michal Berkner, eight years Mr Jenrick’s senior, has heard of that. Despite appearances, he says  he was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and cites  his education at 500-year-old independent school Wolverhampton Grammar  as proof. ‘There was no way my parents could afford to send me to private school. My grandma Dorothy paid the fees.’ Then why no mention of any of it in his  Tory CV? What does he know about life on the breadline? ‘That’s not fair. None of it was inherited or handed on a plate to us. My wife and I have both worked jolly hard,’ he insists. ‘I don’t need to have a disabled daughter to know what it’s like. Pile: Mr Jenrick's third home is a Grade I listed country manor in Hertfordshire, pictured . ‘I don’t need to have lost a child in Afghanistan to meet somebody who has and have empathy and support them.’ He could easily have carried  on enjoying ‘earning money  and having nice homes’ but sacrificed it all in a bid to  become an MP. Come off it, he can afford to because his wife earns approaching half-a-million a year with US law firm Skadden and can pay all the bills. ‘I’m not going to apologise for that. I’m proud of her,’ Mr Jenrick says.","He says Catholic church is 'systematically paedophile' but Pope is nice .

"Theresa Caputo, star of TLC's Long Island Medium, has been forced to defend herself following accusations that she is a hoax. The 46-year-old big-haired TV personality claims to possess the 'gift' of being able to speak with the dead. However professional myth de-bunker Ron Tebo, who investigated Ms Caputo for over a year, told Radar Online that she is nothing more than ‘a vulture preying on the most vulnerable.’ Hoax? Theresa Caputo (pictured), star of TLC's Long Island Medium, is accused of pre-interviewing her audience members in order to glean useful background information on them, as well as 'cold reading', rather than actually being psychic . Mr Tebo has accused Ms Caputo of using a number of . dirty tactics for her show, including investigating and even pre-interviewing her . audience members prior to her live readings, in order to glean information . she can later claim 'came to her from the other side', as well as . employing the methods of  'cold reading'. After his accusations were revealed last week, Ms Caputo, also a New York-based wife and mother-of-two, took to her Facebook page to post the quote: 'Negative people need drama like it was oxygen. Stay positive… and take their breath away.' And following her Saturday evening show in Sacramento, California, Ms Caputo proudly re-tweeted one audience member's gushing review of her 'readings', which stated: 'She truly is the real deal, and a beautiful soul... She truly has a beautiful gift.' Claims: Ms Caputo (pictured earlier this year) has shrugged off claims that she is a fake, posting a quote to her Facebook page that reads 'Negative people need drama like it was oxygen' Gotcha: Professional myth de-bunker Ron Tebo (pictured), has been investigating Ms Caputo for over a year . Cold reading, of which Ms Caputo is being accused, is a set of techniques which . have long been employed by psychics and mediums. According to Austin Kline, author of What Is Cold Reading? Skeptical Perspectives: 'Cold readers commonly employ high probability guesses about . the subject, quickly picking up on signals... as to whether their . guesses are in the right direction or not, and then emphasizing and . reinforcing any chance connections the subjects acknowledge, while . quickly moving on from missed guesses.' 'She was really grasping at straws and did a lot of fishing' Indeed, one audience member at Ms Caputo's April 5 show in Hershey, Pennsylvania, lodged this complaint with Ticketmaster.com: 'She seemed off and almost every reading was like pulling teeth to match up info. She was really grasping at straws and did a lot of ‘fishing'. For the most part, readings were forced and uninspired.' Roaring success: Ms Caputo is said to be worth over a million dollars, has run six seasons of her Long Island Medium show to date, and has an upcoming book entitled, 'You can't make this stuff up' One video on Mr Tebo's website is from an . Anderson Cooper appearance, in which Ms Caputo claims an audience . member is wearing 'his wife's wedding ring', when in fact it is his . mother's. She also asks about his wife's non-existent 'leg problems', . and is proved wrong again. As for readings which appear to be more accurate right off the bat, Mr Tebo has this: 'When you purchase a ticket [to Ms Caputo's show], you provide your full name, address and phone number to the vender. 'The vender can share this information with her staff, and then they can investigate the individual audience members. It seems she focuses on the front rows.' 'My young daughter died this summer and I needed to believe in something. After tonight, I am no longer a believer' And sure enough, according to the website, another audience member from a North Carolina show in October reported to Ticketmaster that the arena held three levels of seating and around 2,500 guests. Allegedly, the medium spent the entire show with only the first floor. 'I was a Theresa Caputo believer and watched every one of her shows', the former fan attests. 'My young daughter died this summer and I needed to believe in something. After tonight, I am no longer a believer... [most of the audience members] left defeated and deflated.' Ms Caputo, who is said to be worth over a million dollars, has run six seasons of her Long Island Medium show to date, and has an upcoming book entitled: 'You Can't Make This Stuff Up.' She has four west coast cities lined up for new shows this week.","Ms Caputo claims she can speak with the dead .

"Urban Outfitters has been forced to apologize for designing a Kent State sweatshirt splattered with fake blood in what appeared to be a reference to the massacre of 1970. Four students were killed and nine severely wounded in the shooting after the Ohio National Guard opened fire at a protest against President Nixon's Cambodian Campaign. But 44 years later it seems the tragedy has served as fashion inspiration for the high street store which released a 'vintage' sweatshirt covered in red blotches with holes by the left shoulder. 'Tasteless': Urban Outfitters has come under fire for stocking this 'vintage' Kent State University sweatshirt that appears to be covered in blood stains in an apparent reference to the May 4 Massacre in 1970 . Horrific: The Ohio National Guard fired 67 shots in 13 seconds at unarmed students during a protest in 1970 . The Ohio university blasted the item as 'beyond poor taste', while survivors of the attack accused the retailer of exploiting tragedy for publicity and profit. The company has now pulled the sweatshirt from its website, and issued an apology. A spokesman for the store said: 'Urban Outfitters sincerely apologizes for any offense our Vintage Kent State Sweatshirt may have caused. 'It was never our intention to allude to the tragic events that took place at Kent State.' The original listing described the sweater as: 'Washed soft and perfectly broken in, this vintage Kent State sweatshirt is cut in a loose, slouchy fit. Excellent vintage condition. We only have one, so get it or regret it!' The Kent State shootings, also known as the May 4 Massacre, tore through a peaceful protest held by unarmed students at the university in Kent City, Ohio. Officers fired 67 shots in 13 seconds, killing four and wounding nine - one of whom was left permanently paralyzed. Some of the dead and wounded had not been involved in the demonstration, held four days after President Nixon announced the Cambodian Incursion - despite pledging to end the Vietnam war in 1968. A statement published on the Kent State University website read: 'We take great offense to a company using our pain for their publicity and profit. 'This item is beyond poor taste and trivializes a loss of life that still hurts the Kent State community today.' Outrage: The jersey with stains and holes appears to mock the shooting, which left one student paralysed . Tragic: Four students died at the protest against the Cambodian Incursian announced days before by Nixon . Statement: Kent State University in Kent City, Ohio, has condemned the design as 'beyond poor taste' Alan Canfora, one of the nine people wounded at Kent State in 1970, said on Monday he had spoken to family members of the victims and they are very upset at Urban Outfitters and do not accept the company's apology. 'This was a crass attempt at free publicity and a very morbid offering to stir up controversy,' Canfora said. People took to social media in outrage to condemn the 'disgusting' Urban Outfitters design, which is now listed as 'sold out' on the website. One wrote: 'Can't believe Urban Outfitters new Kent State sweatshirt with blood stains, who was sleeping when that design was approved?!' Another said: 'Urban Outfitters Red-Stained Kent State Sweatshirt... VERY BAD TASTE' And one commented: 'Ugh. @UrbanOutfitters celebrates my alma mater with a Kent State shooting blood-soaked vintage sweatshirt' Anger: Twitter users, including this Kent State alumnus, blasted the retailer's new controversial design . Disgusted: One user wrote 'VERY BAD TASTE' in response to the $129 sweater, which is now sold out . Confusion: Many expressed their disbelief that senior management allowed the design to be released . Controversy: The store has previously come under fire for allegedly glamorizing eating disorders with an 'eat less' t-shirt (left) last year and mental health issues with a 'depression' crop top (right) in January . The incident is the latest in a series of controversial Urban Outfitters designs. In June, critics blasted the retailer for stocking pens shaped like heroin-filled needles. Earlier this year, the store was accused of mocking mental health disorders by stocking a crop top printed with the word 'depression' - described on the site as a 'super depressing tee from Depression topped with an allover logo graphic.' It came just two years after the firm was forced to pull a t-shirt printed with the words 'eat less' that critics claimed glamorized eating disorders. The cotton v-neck top was modelled by a slim, gaunt young woman and paired with a black mini-skirt. Youth retailer Urban Outfitters operates under the slogan: 'Because living life the conventional way is depressing.' Urban Outfitters did not respond to Mail Online's request for a comment.","Teen retailer has released 'vintage' sweatshirt with red blotches and holes .

"A 19-year-old Vogue model has appeared in court after allegedly stealing three chocolate bars from a shop in New York. Roosmarijn de Kok was stopped as she left Whole Foods in Tribeca, Manhattan, on July 18 with three chocolates and bottle of fish oil in her bag which she had not paid for. She was arrested after a store detective spotted the alleged shoplifting incident and grabbed her before she left. Roosmarijn de Kok, 19, is accused of stealing chocolate bars and fish oil from a Whole Foods store . The Vogue model was stopped by a store detective as she left the shop in Tribeca, Manhattan on July 18 . The security worker then 'recovered the items, property which belonged to the store and for which the defendant had no receipt, from the bag,' the New York Post reported. De Kok, who has previously appeared in Vogue Thailand and has modelled for Urban Outfitters, was charged with misdemeanor petty larceny and criminal possession of stolen property in the fifth degree. The Dutch model was also told off by a judge at Manhattan Criminal Court for folding her arms during the hearing yesterday, in which she was wearing Saint Laurent. Her lawyer, Sal Strazzullo, said de Kok forgot she had the chocolates in her bag after buying fat-free yogurt and protein bars from the health food shop. De Kok, who has modelled for Urban Outfitters, was told off for folding her arms during the court hearing . De Kok's lawyer Sal Strazzullo says the Dutch beauty queen is 'totally innocent' and tried to give back the goods . 'While she was about to leave the store … she remembered what she had in her bag. When she turned around, the store detectives were like: ""We got you""' he said. 'The complaint states that she attempted to leave — it doesn't state that she did leave. She's totally innocent.' Prosecutors offered de Kok an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal (ACD), meaning the charges would be dropped if the beauty queen stays out of trouble for a period of time. But Mr Strazzullo said: 'I don't think she should even have to take an ACD when she didn't do anything wrong.' The case continues.

"Girlguiding, formerly known as the Guides, has taken its first steps into the political jungle with a manifesto . The Girl Guides once taught young women to cope away from civilisation with camping trips and nature skills. Now, they are more concerned with helping them face the challenges of modern life. The youth group yesterday took its first step into politics, demanding school lessons in body confidence and equal numbers of men and women in Parliament. It said ‘young women still believe they are too often treated like second-class citizens’. Claiming that three quarters of teenage girls believe sexism affects most areas of their lives, the Guides said that there is ‘overwhelming evidence of inequality for girls in the UK.’ Its campaign, launched at the outset of the party conference season, made eight demands it said politicians should promise to meet in advance of next year’s general election. They included a call for equal representation in Parliament for men and women, ‘modernised’ sex education in schools, a ban on ‘harmful sexualised content in mainstream media’, and a rule that all schools must teach ‘body confidence and gender equality’. The manifesto was instantly praised by Labour leaders. Ed Miliband said the campaign ‘addresses issues which are important to the Labour Party’ and added that the party already uses all-women shortlists to select candidates and is planning to go further towards the Guides’ demands. Shadow Equalities Minister Gloria de Piero said the Guides ‘are doing great work to make sure girls’ voices are heard by politicians.’ The intervention into politics is the latest step in a radical re-alignment of the girls’ movement over the past two years. The Guides – who now call themselves Girlguiding – have removed references to loving God and serving country from the promise all members must make. Instead of professing patriotism and religious faith, girls joining the organisation will have to promise ‘to be true to myself’ and ‘to serve my community’. The Guides now offer their members a badge in what the movement’s leaders call body confidence training, in which girls are encouraged to develop their self-image by looking for airbrushing in magazine pictures and talking about sex. Girlguiding has also brought in a chief executive, Julie Bentley, who used to lead the contraception and sex educaton pressure group fpa. Ed Miliband said the campaign addressed issues that were important to labour while Shadow Equalities Minister Gloria de Piero (right) said Guides were doing 'great work' The changes have come at a time when membership increases have been slow compared to the Guides’ rival movement, the Scouts. The Guides new ‘Girls Matter’ campaign includes a call to politicians to ensure ‘that girls should not have to grow up afraid to walk down the street or accept harassment as commonplace or feel embarrassed and undermined by the way women are portrayed in the media.’ One of the figures behind the campaign, 17-year-old Ellie Dibben, said: ‘The Government is inclined to forget those who are not present among them. Girls and young women are a demographic constantly being told that they have no right to a voice.’ Miss Bentley said: ‘We have a responsibility as the leading charity for girls and young women to ensure their voices are head on the issues that affect them. 'Within Guiding we have young women who are passionate and determined to bring about positive societal change to help make lives for their peers here and around the world better.’ Tracy Crouch MP said the campaign may 'disservice' girls . The campaign is based on claims, gathered from surveys commissioned by the Guides, that nearly nine out of 10 girls aged between 11 and 21 think women are judged on appearance rather than ability; that three quarters think there are too many pictures of naked women in the media; and seven out of 10 aged over 13 say they have been sexually harassed. Three quarters say ‘girls are judged harshly for sexual behaviour seen as acceptable in boys’. Its political demands included that schools stamp out sexual bullying and harassment, and that British aid policies should make girls’ rights a priority. Ed Miliband said that Labour would take the Guides’ demands into account when drawing up its election manifesto. ‘The Girls Matter campaign is a great campaign, addressing issues which are important to the Labour Party,’ Mr Miliband said. ‘We are already committed to introducing compulsory sex education in schools and girls and young women’s voices are essential in helping us to shape that. 'We are also committed to looking at how we enforce a zero-tolerance approach to sexual bullying and harassment, not just in schools but in all areas of life. ‘I am committed to working towards having a Cabinet, a Parliament and a Party where women are equally represented. 'My party is pushing this forward through the use of all-women shortlists but there is more we all need to do to make equality in political life a reality.’ Tories were less impressed, however. Backbench Tory Tracey Crouch, a former guide who is MP for Chatham and Aylesford, said: ‘Girlguiding is a hugely important organisation who I enjoy working with, but it is a shame that they have not recognised the work that the Government is already doing to combat many of the issues they raise. 'Sadly I fear this may do a disservice to the girls they seek to empower.’","'Girls Matter' campaign based on research among  girls .

"Football fans will have their voice heard in every boardroom in the country, if plans unveiled by Labour on Friday are approved. Labour hope this will stop the wishes of fans being ignored when decisions are made concerning their clubs, as has been seen in recent years at Cardiff City and Hull. The Welsh side's owner Vincent Tan changed the colour of Cardiff's home shirts from blue to red in 2012 despite strong opposition from supporters, while Hull City became Hull City Tigers in 2013, removing 'Association Football Club' which had been part of the name since its formation in 1904. Cardiff City owner Vincent Tan changed the club's home shirt from blue to red to appeal to audiences abroad . Meanwhile, in 2013, Hull City owner Assem Allam changed the club's name to include Tigers after Hull City . Labour argue despite the commercial explosion of English and Welsh football, there are no effective means for fans to have a say in how their clubs are run or to protect their long-term interests. They say this lack of accountability has led to: . • Supporters’ interests and identity being ignored: from clubs being relocated away from fan-bases (Coventry) to team colours and names being changed to satisfy traditions on the other side of the globe (Cardiff, Hull) • Debt and insolvency: which have seen  football clubs (Portsmouth, Leeds, Birmingham) forced into administration. 36 football league clubs (exactly half the total number of members) have gone into administration since 1992 . • Unsustainably high ticket prices: despite record turnover, average ticket prices in England and Wales remain amongst the highest in Europe - only this week, the BBC’s Price of football survey showed how average prices have risen at almost twice the rate of the cost of living since 2011 . Clive Efford MP, Labour's Shadow Sports Minister, will launch the proposals, which have been drawn up in consultation with 95 football supporters' organisations, and would require supporters to come together to form a single accredited trust. In return they would have the right to appoint directors to the board of their clubs and the option to buy up to 10 per cent of shares if their club changes ownership. 'Too often fans are treated like an after-thought as ticket prices are hiked-up, grounds re-located and clubs burdened with debt or the threat of bankruptcy,' said Efford. 'Only this week, the BBC Price of Football survey showed how average prices have risen at almost twice the rate of the cost of living since 2011. We have reached a tipping point in the way football is run. 'The Labour Party has listened to the views of fans about changing the way football is run in England and Wales. And we want to ensure they are heard by the owners of the clubs too. 'We will now consult further on proposals to enshrine on the statute books the idea that football have a special place in people's hearts – and should be the heart of our communities.' Football fans up and down the country continue to be squeezed as ticket prices rise above the rate of inflation . Arsenal topped the list for the most expensive matchday ticket at £97 and dearest season ticket at £2,013 . Jon Cruddas MP, head of Labour’s Policy Review, added: 'The Premier League is a huge success. But football is more than a business. Football clubs are part of people’s identity and sense of belonging. Our plan is to give fans a stake in their clubs.' 'Labour believes in sharing power and responsibility with people, and giving football fans a voice is part of our plan to change our country by devolving power to our cities, towns and communities. We believe in a society that gives power to people.' Cheapest season ticket in Premier League £299 at Manchester City . Cheapest matchday ticket in Premier League £15 at Newcastle United .

"Jamaal Charles returned from an ankle injury and scored three touchdowns to guide the Kansas City Chiefs to a thumping 41-14 win over the New England Patriots on Monday. The running back, who missed last week's win in Miami with a sprained ankle, rushed for 92 yards and a score and also caught two touchdown passes from quarterback Alex Smith. Smith finished with 248 passing yards and three touchdowns at Arrowhead Stadium, but his opposite number Tom Brady was picked off twice on a miserable night for the Patriots. 'Coach said he was going to look for me, and see how it feels during the game,' Charles said, 'and I guess I started feeling like myself. He didn't want to take me out.' Jamaal Charles scored three touchdowns as the Kansas City Chiefs smashed the New England Patriots . Jamaal Charles (25) returned from injury and ran the Patriots defense ragged at Arrowhead Stadium . The Chiefs (2-2) ended a four-game losing streak at their Arrowhead Stadium home dating to last season. Patriots quarterback Brady saw one of his two interceptions returned for a touchdown and finished 14 of 23 for 159 yards and a touchdown. 'It was just a bad performance by everybody,' Brady said. 'We need to make sure we never have this feeling again. We've got to figure out what we have to do better.' With the game out of hand, the Patriots gave rookie quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo a chance to play. He threw a late touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowski to complete the scoring. 'Just wanted to play everybody,' Patriots coach Bill Belichick said. The Chiefs forced the Patriots to air it out by stuffing running backs Shane Vereen and Stevan Ridley. And when Brady dropped back, their front seven ran roughshod over New England's suspect offensive line. Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith finished with 248 passing yards and three touchdowns . It hardly helped the Patriots' offense that it was trying to operate on the same night Chiefs fans were trying to reclaim the record for loudest outdoor sports venue. The record was set in the first half, when Guinness World Records noted a noise level of 142.2 decibels — breaking the mark of 137.6 that the Seattle Seahawks' fans had set last season. 'My ears are still ringing,' Reid said with a smile. The crowd included several members of the Royals, who made the walk across the parking lot from Kauffman Stadium to watch the start of the game on the sidelines. The Royals will play their first postseason game since 1985 against the Oakland Athletics on Tuesday night. Knile Davis added 107 yards rushing for Kansas City, forming a potent one-two punch with Charles in the backfield. Tight end Travis Kelce had eight catches for 93 yards and a score. 'Some nights things come together,' Smith said. 'Guys execute and you take advantage.' Tom Brady was sacked twice on a miserable Monday night for the New England Patriots . The Kansas City Chiefs cheerleaders perform for the crowd gathered at Arrowhead Stadium . Charles was executing right from the start, giving the Chiefs a lead with his first-quarter touchdown plunge. He then extended the lead with a 5-yard TD catch in the second quarter. Cairo Santos added a 22-yard field goal just before halftime for a 17-0 lead. The field goal came after the Chiefs were bailed out by a defensive penalty. They had been stopped short on a pass play with 8 seconds left, but the penalty gave them a second chance. Kansas City had 303 yards of first-half offense, the most against any Belichick-coached team. Charles added his third touchdown of the game early in the second half, taking a short pass in the flat and stumbling into the end zone. He appeared to grab his hamstring on the way down and was met by trainers as he exited the field. After a brief trip to the locker room, Charles logged a few more carries before his night was done. By that point, the game was pretty much done, too. Brady threw a 44-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter to Brandon LaFell, who slipped the grasp of cornerback Marcus Cooper to reach the end zone. But he was picked off by Husain Abdullah later in the half, and Abdullah returned the interception 39 yards for a touchdown. Abdullah was flagged afterward for unsportsmanlike conduct, but the devout Muslim said it had nothing to do with dropping to his knees in prayer. He said the penalty came because he slid to his knees. The lesson learned? 'Stop before you drop,' Abdullah said.

Ten weeks on from extending a welcoming handshake to the former Dundee United full-back at the KC Stadium, Snodgrass’ fears for Robertson have long since evaporated. Andrew Robertson has taken to the Premier League like a duck to water since joining from Dundee United . Robertson played for Scotland U21s during their Euro 2015 qualifiers last year . To say the player has taken to the task like a duck to water is to do him a huge disservice. The same goes for his ascent to the Scotland team. From playing with Queen’s Park at Hampden to eyeing Georgia at Ibrox in a Scotland shirt in little over a year, Robertson’s story would normally be reserved for the pages of a child’s comic. As for the surrogate big brother, fulsome praise has long since replaced those early words of advice. ‘He’s a very level-headed lad,’ Snodgrass said. ‘As he’s Scottish, you feel it’s your duty when he comes down to make sure he’s okay. ‘There’s only so much you can do but he’s dealt with everything Steve Bruce has thrown at him - some big tests. You always hear about whether someone can cut it at the top. Well the only way to find out is to give them a chance. The manager has done that so fair play to him and fair play to Robbo for taking it. ‘When Andy did come down, the first thing I told him was to believe that he could cut it there. You go in there with no fear like he did, and show people what you can do. He’s got a great left foot and the way he attacks is terrific. He’s learning each day and that’s good. He’s in the gym working hard on his upper body and physique. Robertson (right) alongside his Scottish teammate James McArthur (left) last weekend . Robertson (right) played a starring role in Hull City's win over Crystal Palace at the KC Stadium last week . ‘It can only be good for Scotland when lads like that come through. He’s got a big future ahead of him. You see him on TV and he stands out straight away. Some lads are shell-shocked by the occasion and that’s one thing he’s not. He’s been terrific.” A serious knee injury sustained on his Hull debut means Snodgrass can do no more than roar himself hoarse at Ibrox this evening. If the mental anguish at being excluded from the opening four games of the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign has been comparable with the physical pain of dislocating his knee at Loftus Road, the 27-year-old has taken considerable comfort in the way Gordon Strachan and his players have dealt with his misfortune. ‘Every one of the lads in the squad has wished me all the best since my injury,’ he added. ‘Most of them have been through something similar and the manager has also been on the phone, trying to get me to the team hotel and to sit in on the meetings. ‘That shows the character of the man. He wants us all to feel part of it and I take my hat off to him. ‘It feels like a club whenever we meet up and that bodes well for the future. We might only meet five or six times each year but we’ve kept the core of the squad together, with just a few additions here and there. Robertson (left), alongside Sean Dillon (centre) and Ryan Gauld (right) after Dundee's win against Rangers in the Scottish Cup semi-final at Ibrox in April 2014 - just months before the Hull man's move south . ‘The manager has worked to get that spirit and whenever anyone new comes into the group he’s the first one to make sure that they’re involved. ‘He tells them: “Listen, you need to be part of this because we’ve got something going here so get in there and start bonding” — and that’s what happens.’ It could be said that Strachan owes Snodgrass more than any other. It was, after all, his winning goal in Zagreb a year past in June that began to turn the tanker around. The subsequent progress made has meant the tangible feeling of optimism ahead of the match this evening now has a sound grounding in reality. Reflecting on that night in Croatia, Snodgrass said: ‘I don’t know if that was just the crazy Jock mentality or whether it was down to the feel-good factor and the confidence that the gaffer has bred in us all. That patriotic thing comes out and you think: “We can do this”. ‘It’s like Manchester United players coming out and saying that they used to beat opposing teams in the tunnel because they could see the fear in their faces. ‘When you have the belief that we have now then you give yourself a better chance of winning games. ‘So many times over the years you must have sat and interviewed Scotland players and thought: “This is the same old story here”. Robertson in action for Scotland's senior team in a friendly against Nigeria at Craven Cottage . ‘But now I’m sure you’re thinking that this is our time, that you can see signs that we’re making progress here.’ The epitome of Strachan’s ‘one for all and all for one’ doctrine, Snodgrass typically parks his personal difficulties to talk up his belief in those who will face Georgia tonight. But there’s no escaping that it’s been hard. Extremely hard. For a player who hardly knew what a day without training or a week without a game was, the first serious injury of his career felt like someone switching off a light. ‘It’s quite difficult not being part of things,’ he admitted. ‘There’s no better feeling when you cross that white line, that childhood feeling comes out in you that you’re playing football. ‘For that 90 minutes you’re free, you do what you do and that’s what you’ve worked all week for. That side of things I am missing. ‘I’ll be honest, it’s been tough. But I’ll approach it each day at a time. I haven’t had big injuries, this is the first one. ‘It’s been really hard especially when you’ve got family and such. It affects everything. Anyone living with a footballer will tell you it’s difficult because one thing can set you over the edge. ‘Down there they’ve got a lot of psychologists which is really good because you can speak to people and talk to them. ‘I’ve seen many players come out saying through injuries they’ve hit depression. I don’t want that for me. ‘That’s why I’m focusing on things, being the best person I can be and trying to give everything each day in my recovery.’","When Andrew Robertson made the move down from Dundee United to Hull City, Robert Snodgrass wanted to make sure he settled in properly .

"Charlie Sharples scored a hat-trick as Gloucester began a new era of European rugby with a bang by thrashing French side Brive in the inaugural Challenge Cup. The overhaul of European rugby sees the competition replace the Amlin Challenge Cup this season and Gloucester launched their campaign in style with an emphatic victory at Kingsholm. Sharples was making his 150th competitive appearance for the Cherry and Whites and the winger celebrated the milestone with a try in the first half and two more after half-time. Gloucester's Charlie Sharples scores their first try during the European Rugby Challenge Cup match . James Hook of Gloucester bursts clear in the victory over Brive at Kingsholm . Brive looked to have hit back almost immediately after Sharples' first score in the 16th minute but the visitors' try was ruled out for a knock-on in the build-up. Gloucester led 10-0 at the interval but the hosts, still rebuilding under the leadership of new director of rugby David Humphreys, rolled through the gears in the second period. Sharples added two more to his tally while James Hook, Darren Dawidiuk and Dan Robson all crossed the whitewash as both sides were reduced to 14 men after Gloucester's Yann Thomas and Brive's Damien Jourdain were both shown yellow cards.

"Scotland midfielder Shaun Maloney feels their dominant performance against Georgia was further evidence of how much more comfortable they are in possession under Gordon Strachan. Scotland needed an own goal to claim a 1-0 win in their opening home European Championship qualifier but the scoreline did not reflect their superiority, particularly in the first half when they forced a number of corners and pressed the visitors back. Although Georgia improved after the break, Scotland created far more opportunities and would have been more comfortable had they been more clinical in the final third. Steven Naismith missed two good chances and James Morrison forced a good late save. Shaun Maloney scores the winning goal in Scotland's 1-0 defeat of Georgia at Ibrox . Wigan midfielder has credited coach Gordon Strachan for introducing possession play to Scotland . Scotland goalkeeper David Marshall did not have a save to make, although Georgia sub Irakli Dzaria missed the target from 18 yards when presented with a decent chance in the final 15 minutes. For Maloney, the display showed Scotland are a team which is continuing to grow in confidence, with a further test to come on Tuesday when they take on a Poland side fresh from victory over world champions Germany. Maloney, whose 27th-minute drive eventually went in off Akaki Khubutia, said: 'It's something that we are not really known for, a nation that has a higher pass retention and more possession than the other team, but we are slowly trying to change that. 'We are trying to change that throughout the age groups but the most important thing at the moment is the first team and the manager has been speaking about it for the last 12 months or so. 'On Saturday night it probably came to fruition but I think it will be a completely different game in Poland, I don't think we will have as much of the ball as that, but it was certainly enjoyable. 'In the last 10 minutes we could have probably kept the ball a bit better and maybe not attacked every time we got it, and seen the game out a little bit more comfortably. But maybe I'm nit-picking. I think overall we have got to be pretty impressed with the first 70 minutes.' Maloney is congratulated by a Scotland fan after scoring his goal in the Euro 2016 qualifier . Everton striker Steven Naismith was guilty of missing opportunities against Georgia . Scotland's most recent qualifying campaign, for the Brazil World Cup, was undermined by a slow start when home draws with Serbia and Macedonia put pressure on them and led to calls for manager Craig Levein to be sacked. Levein survived for two more games but they were defeats in Wales and Belgium which left Strachan with an insurmountable task when he took over. Given that painful experience, Maloney was well aware how important winning the Ibrox encounter was. Scotland players celebrate after the result that takes them third in their group ahead of Germany . Scotland moved above Germany on goal difference after the world champions were beaten by Poland . 'It was a huge game for us to win,' he said. 'We have spoken about how well we have done in the last 18 months but now these games really matter, getting a home win was so important. 'We saw it out in the last 10 minutes. We should have got at least a couple more so the last 10 minutes we re a little bit uncomfortable. 'But it takes a little bit of pressure off us. The home games come with pressure from the fans and the expectations of trying to win your home games will transfer to Poland. I think we'll be tactically different and a little bit of pressure might come off us.' Scotland have already won in Warsaw this year - Scott Brown netting the only goal in a March friendly. Scotland are likely to change their tactics for their next game against Robert Lewandowski's (L) Poland . And previous away wins in Croatia, Norway and Macedonia under Strachan can give Scotland confidence for Tuesday night's game, no matter how buoyant the hosts will be following their 2-0 victory over Germany. Maloney said: 'Recently we have been pretty good away from home. The pace of (Ikechi) Anya has been huge and obviously Alan Hutton and (Andrew) Robertson, full-backs that pushed up on Saturday. 'It's a huge advantage if you've got pace in your side and at the minute we've got that.'","Scotland defeated Georgia 1-0 in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Saturday .

"A wife from hell who was given an Asbo for repeatedly shouting at her husband has been arrested for allegedly thumping her husband during a row, it has been revealed. Julie Griffiths, 45, has been taken to court on several occasions for launching loud rants at her other half, Norman - earning her the nickname 'nagsbo'. Now it has been revealed that she was arrested for assaulting her 64-year-old husband - but after being hauled before court, the charge was dropped. Julie Griffiths (pictured left), dubbed nagsbo for repeatedly shouting at her husband Norman (right), was arrested for allegedly assaulting her 64-year-old other half, it has been revealed . The Sun has reported this morning that neighbours say police have made a series of visits to the couple's home in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, amid reports of bust-ups. The newspaper quotes doorman James Clarke, 52, as saying: 'Police have been a few times. When she was arrested, we were all overjoyed.' Staffordshire Police confirmed in a statement that they were called to a 'domestic incident' in a street in Stoke-on-Trent. A spokesman added: 'Julie Griffiths, 45, was arrested at the scene on suspicion of common assault. 'She was subsequently charged with assault by beating.' Mrs Griffiths' former Staffordshire home, where neighbours complained about her noise . The statement added that she was later bailed to appear before the North Staffordshire Domestic Violence Court, sitting at Newcastle Magistrates' Court earlier this month. A court official confirmed the case was discontinued. The couple are believed to be coming up to their 25th anniversary this weekend. Those living near their former home in Talke, Staffordshire celebrated last month after it emerged the couple were moving out after more than a decade living in their pink terraced house. Mrs Griffiths was originally handed a five-year Asbo in December 2012 after noise monitoring equipment was installed to measure the volume of her shouting. But earlier this year she was accused of breaching the order, landing her back in court. The case was later axed. Neighbours of Mrs Griffiths were said to be 'popping champagne corks' when she left her former home. Julie Griffiths, pictured, saw the assault charge against her dropped after she made a court appearance, it has been revealed . Complaints had been made against her moaning since 1999, but it was around thirteen years before she received her Asbo. The ruling prohibited her from creating noise audible to neighbouring properties, shouting, screaming or banging on internal doors and communicating with certain neighbours. Earlier this year she was fined for the noise she made when berating 64-year-old Mr Griffiths for buying the wrong type of scratch card. This was before a third court appearance where she was accused laying into her partner's hygiene. Friends say the couple have been married for more than 20 years but Griffiths' nagging only became an issue three years ago. She has reportedly been banned from numerous family events because of her tantrums.","Julie Griffiths earned the nickname for loud rants at husband Norman .

"Maruf Yousaf, 16, whom police described as 'a bully and a wannabe gangster', has been given an Asbo . A schoolboy who terrorised pensioners and disabled people as he walked home from school has been given as Asbo. Police described Maruf Yousaf, 16, as 'cocky with a poor attitude; a bully and a wannabe gangster', and said he threatened and robbed his victims, mocking their age or disabilities, often while still in his school uniform. Yousaf, of Brierfield, Lancashire, was named by Lancashire Police officers after he was handed a two-year antisocial behaviour order (Asbo) at Burnley Magistrates' Court. The court heard how Yousaf's victims, often vulnerable through age or disability, would call police to say he had targeted them, swearing at them, assaulting them, jostling them or robbing them. Some reported having their windows smashed after they stood up to the baby-faced teenager, whom police have named. Over a six-month period, Yousaf was also involved in shoplifting, breaking into cars and hitting shoppers in his hometown, magistrates heard. Citing Yousaf's 'increasing levels of anti-social behaviour, hate crime, criminal damage and robbery', police and Pendle Council began proceedings against the teenager which resulted in him being given an Asbo last Thursday. Now the teenager, who attended Colne Primet High School, has been ordered to stay out of the town centre unless he is with his mother. He also cannot associate with four other youths, Shakeel Hussain, Hassan Ahmed, Fayzal Anwar and Qadir Ahmed, other than for 'educational or religious purposes', and faces jail if he does not comply with the order. PC Karen Isherwood of Lancashire Police said: 'His typical behaviour was that he would identify someone who was vulnerable, like the elderly or disabled,  and he would be abusive and cause damage. 'He would make them feel intimated, and make them feel more vulnerable and frightened to be out on the streets.' 'He was making people's lives a misery.' She said 'a lot of work had been to address his behaviour', and said that he was attending school but committing the offences after school hours. PC Isherwood added: 'We won't tolerate this sort of behaviour and will take the action needed.' Brierfield Labour councillor Nawaz Ahmed said: 'The things that he was doing were just intolerable - he was making innocent people's lives miserable, and that can never be accepted.' Pendle councillor David Whipp said Yousaf had acted like a 'one boy crime wave.' He added: 'This boy has caused a considerable amount of harm and distress to local people. 'We will not tolerate this type of behaviour from anybody.' Coward: The baby-faced teenager would pick on the vulnerable on his way home from Colne Prime High School .

"Gordon Strachan has admitted that even his players have no idea who will captain Scotland against Georgia. Fit-again Scott Brown is vying with long-term squad skipper Darren Fletcher for the honour of leading the team out for this evening’s Euro 2016 qualifier at Ibrox. Sportsmail understands David Marshall has won the race with Craig Gordon to be Strachan’s No1, but the manager will keep his senior midfield duo waiting until the team announcement on Saturday morning before handing out the armband. Scotland manager Gordon Strachan on the pitch as his player train ahead of the match against Georgia . Gordon Strachan addresses the media on Friday at Mar Hall in Bishopton . Fletcher has captained the country 23 times since taking the armband from Barry Ferguson in 2009. But Celtic skipper Brown deputised during the Manchester United midfielder’s lengthy illness. And that leaves Strachan to break the news of his final decision to both players this morning. ‘The captain doesn’t know yet,’ said the Scotland boss. ‘The captain doesn’t know it’s him. ‘But when the team is announced in the morning we will announce the captain at the same time. ‘Remember, James Morrison has been captain as well. There are boys who have been captain who have done a smashing job and we have good leaders here.’ The decision could hinge on whether Fletcher plays from the start. His last first-team appearance under Louis van Gaal was a home win over West Ham on September 27. Strachan said he has no issue with playing key lieutenants who are out of their club team, as he proved before with Alan Hutton, and insisted the matter will have no bearing on who he selects for his starting 11 or for captain. ‘It’s not a problem,’ he added. ‘You never know when the right time is to tell people they are captain or that they are dropped. ‘It’s a thing, a debate, which has been going on since I’ve been in fitba. Scotland players warm up at Ibrox as manager Gordon Strachan watches on . ‘When is the right time to tell a player? If you tell them too early they are disappointed. Do you tell them later? ‘You have to get it right and different people take it different ways. ‘I remember a boy Richard Shaw at Coventry. Every time I dropped him he wouldn’t speak to me for a week. Just wouldn’t speak to me. We’re the best of mates now. But back then he didn’t want to speak to me.’ Asked if the identity of the Scotland captain really mattered, Strachan insisted: ‘Does it matter to the group? I don’t think so. ‘I think we have people in the group — James as well — who could captain the side. ‘I don’t think it would make any difference to the rest of the group because they feel comfortable with these lads. ‘I played for Scotland as captain and not as captain. I was more than happy. It was not a problem. It’s just about how you deal with it yourself. ‘I was left out for over a year with Scotland under Andy Roxburgh, I then came back and ended up being captain. Andy is one of my best mates in football. I was fine, I just looked at myself and thought: “I’m not playing very well.” I could understand it.’ Scott Brown (centre) is one of the candidates to lead Scotland against Georgia on Saturday . Celtic captain Brown missed the opening qualifying defeat to Germany through injury, but admitted he would love to reclaim the role he held in Fletcher’s absence. ‘I don’t know if I’m captain yet,’ said Brown. ‘We find that out tomorrow. It’s up to the manager. ‘I’ve got to be honest, the captaincy means a lot to whoever does get the honour. ‘Myself, Darren has been captain in the past, Gary Caldwell, Kenny Miller … if you ask any of us, it’s a proud moment. ‘But so is playing for your country, so is winning with your country, getting to a major finals. ‘That’s what we all want. It’s not about fighting over a captaincy – it’s about joining together and being more of a team than ever.’","Sportsmail understands David Marshall has won the race to be captain .

"Wayne Hennessey, take a bow. Then your man-of-the-match prize. It requires something special to shift the Welsh spotlight away from Gareth Bale, but on a night when the Real Madrid player did not quite produce his comic-book heroics, Crystal Palace's second choice staopper earned his nation a point with a performance that defied logic as much as the Bosnian attack on Friday night. Out from the Selhurst Park freezer, his string of saves very nearly got Wales all three. In added time, Bale advanced with predatory instinct and struck a fearsome shot that Asmir Begovic strained every sinew to tip wide. Then Bale whipped over the corner but Hal Robson-Kanu to get himself in a mess from two yards out. Wales forward Gareth Bale narrowly misses with this shot on goal against Bosnia and Herzegovina . Wales (3-5-2): Hennessey 8; Gunter 7, A Williams 6.5, Chester 6.5, Davies 6.5, Taylor 6.5; Ledley 6.5, King 6, J Williams 7 (G Williams 83’); Bale 7.5, Church 5.5 (Robson-Kanu 65’ 6.5) Booked: Taylor, Chester, A Williams .

Manager: Safet Susic 6.5 . Ref: Vladislav Bezborodov 5 . MoM: Hennessey . Att: 30,741 . Ashley Williams had an excellent chance too in the 78th minute, arriving unmarked onto Bale’s free-kick six yards out only to head over. Hennessey provided that platform though, his best save of the night coming 10 minutes from the end. Miralem Pjanic hit his free-kick from 25 yards with dip and swerve but Hennessey threw his 6ft 6in frame into the air, reached up a glove, and diverted the ball wide. It was as thrilling as goalless draws come, and sees Wales top Group B in qualifying for Euro 2016. This was the most eagerly anticipated home international in years and it showed in the roads around Cardiff. Heavy traffic meant the stadium bore plenty of empty seats at kick-off. Eventually the projected 30,741 crowd assembled to mark the biggest since England visited the Millenium in March 2011. They had come hoping to see Wales make a statement of their intentions in this qualifying campaign; they had come wanting Bale to do the business again. In the seventh minute, he should have. Joe Ledley fed the ball to Chris Gunter on the right wing and the Reading player immediately saw Bale had somehow been granted more space in the Bosnia area than he might expect walking atop Mount Snowdon. A swift cross followed but, from inside the six-yard box, Bale fluffed his lines and missed the ball. Defender Toni Sunjic leapt to divert it for a corner. It was a promising start nevertheless. Bale had another opportunity when Ben Davies sent a high pass forward but world’s most expensive left boot only managed to send a lofted volley wide. Then Gunter volleyed over from Neil Taylor’s cross. Wales forward Gareth Bale gets in a shot at goal during the  EURO 2016 qualifier .

Gradually, though, with Everton’s Muhamed Besic doing an excellent job marking Bale, Bosnia gained increasing possession. Pjanic, so effective for Roma at Manchester City in the Champions League, was at the heart of most it. He had already seen a deflected shot from range test Hennessey before he fired an effort just wide in the 27th minute. The second period saw Hennessey come to the fore. He may be keeping the Palace bench warm but he was alert time and again as Bosnia laid siege to the Welsh goal for the first ten minutes after the interval.

Wales forward Hal Robson-Kanu has a shot at goal against Bosnia and Herzegovina . He spread himself to deny Haris Medunjanin from four yards following Tino-Sven Susic’s cross, then saved twice from Edin Dezko, the second at full-stretch as the City striker nodded a high ball into the far corner. His second save from Medunjanin, as Wales groaned under the pressure, was just as impressive. He pushed the Bosnian’s shot from range far away from the three lurking attackers. The intensity of the evening was laid bare when a mass melee broke out following James Chester’s firm, yet fair, tackle on Besic that earned him an undeserved yellow card. Ashley Williams and Dzeko were both booked by referee Vladislav Bezborodov, seemingly for the crime of being captains. The episode illustrated Welsh steel, something missing during previous campaigns. ‘We dug deep,’ said manager Chris Coleman. ‘Last time we got bullied by Bosnia (in a 2012 friendly) but we were never bullied tonight.’ Bosnia and Herzegovina's striker Edin Dzeko (R) runs with the ball during the Euro 2016 qualifier .

Another person to congratulate James on his victory was Simon Cowell, who wrote on Twitter: 'Congratulations James on winning X factor uk. You deserved this.'

Gary Barlow also acknowledged Jahmene's tough start in life, saying: 'You have been battling with your past and fighting for your future you have done it with such dignity and grace. 'Congratulations another stunning night for you.' But Jahmene's mentor Nicole struggled . to control her emotions following the performance, breaking down as she . listened to him sing. Following the song, Nicole told Jahmene: 'You just bring spirit and hope to this song when you sing I . just feel safe. Your my role model you are like a beacon of light. I . love you sweetie..' James was next to take to the stage, performing his unique version of Marvin Gaye's Let's Get it On.

"Morgan Schneiderlin says he has been impressed by the ambition shown by Southampton to replace some of their departing stars after appearing set for the exit himself in the summer. This has been a tumultuous few months for all those connected with Saints, with a best-ever Barclays Premier League campaign swiftly followed by the exit of manager Mauricio Pochettino and a host of key players. Those exits, as well as the January departure of divisive executive chairman Nicola Cortese, led to widespread talk of a meltdown at St Mary's, which Schneiderlin got caught up in during what he called an 'unbelievable summer' collectively and individually. Morgan Schneiderlin (left) shoots past Daryl Janmaat (right) to score Southampton's fourth on Saturday . Ronald Koeman, manager of Southampton, celebrates Morgan Schneiderlin's strike against Newcastle . Morgan Schneiderlin (second right) celebrates with team-mates after scoring on Saturday . Fresh from representing France at the World Cup, the midfielder made no secret of his desire to leave St Mary's but the club dug their heels in and managed to retain his services amidst interest from the likes of Tottenham. Some supporters have said keeping hold of Schneiderlin is the best bit of business Saints did this summer - the kind of support he is determined to repay. 'It was just fantastic,' he said. 'It's like I said before, for me, I never wanted to disrespect anyone and it's just sometimes in life that you need to make choices. 'I think everyone - I think you, I think the fans, I think everyone - was a bit worried when we lost so many players at the start and, of course, you ask yourself the question. 'For me, I had a big step in the World Cup, so I didn't want to struggle in this year. 'But the club showed by buying players that they still have ambitions and that's just what I was asking for. 'The fans, they're very good with me for six years, for seven years now and I'm very happy and I just want to give them back something.' Tim Krul (centre) can only watch as Morga Schneiderlin's strike finds the top corner . Morgan Schneiderlin is a regular in the French national team, pictured versus Serbia on September 7 . Schneiderlin says the situation is now resolved and he is relishing the chance to keep improving under Ronald Koeman. The 24-year-old has started the season fantastically, following up a brace in the win at West Ham with a fine curling effort at the end of Saturday's 4-0 defeat of Newcastle - against whom six of Saints' eight summer signings started. 'They have a very good scouting department and they took some very good players and players who will integrate into the philosophy of the club,' Schneiderlin said. 'Nice people who want to work hard and everything, and that's all well done to them. 'Losing players like Luke Shaw, like Rickie Lambert, like Adam Lallana, like Dejan Lovren, it's something that's very hard to replace and after four games we are happy. Morgan Schneiderlin (left) battles with Moussa Sissoko (right) during Southampton's match on Saturday . 'But we need to make a judgement at the end of the season, or in six months. We have to stay with our feet on the ground, keep working and then doing our best, but it's at the end of the year that everyone's going to judge us.' For Saturday's opponents Newcastle, however, many have already made their judgement. The fans called for manager Alan Pardew to leave throughout the match at St Mary's after a tepid and, at times, embarrassing display. Schneiderlin played under Pardew during his time at Saints but it is his friends in the Newcastle team he feels particular sympathy for. 'Remy Cabella, Moussa Sissoko, everyone, they're good friends of mine and, of course, it's difficult for them,' he said, holding Cabella's shirt. 'They are very good players and, the mix, it takes time for all of them. 'It takes longer for some than others, but they are good players, I'm sure they will bounce back and they will have a good season. 'I'm not really worried, because I know their quality, and they are hard workers as well and they're going to bounce back.'

"Gordon Strachan has warned his Scotland players to prepare for a frantic British-style cup tie against the Republic of Ireland next month. The Irish are unbeaten in Euro 2016 qualifying group D, a last-minute equaliser against struggling group favourites Germany removing some of the gloss from Scotland’s 2-2 draw in Poland. In a game mined with sub plots, Strachan will go head to head with his Celtic predecessor Martin O’Neill at Parkhead on November 14. The presence of former Hoops stars Robbie Keane and Aiden McGeady in Irish shirts will add further spice to a game Strachan anticipates being explosive. Scotland manager Gordon Strachan relishing Euro 2016 clash against the Republic of Ireland . ‘It’ll be a British cup tie type thing,’ predicted the Scotland boss. ‘Neither of us will be too interested in who wins the possession, put it that way. ‘There will be analysts telling us at half-time how many passes each team had. They’ll be like: “You’ve had 452 passes, you’re going great,” so the lads can keep passing. ‘But, no, Martin and I will feel the same about it. If players feel fatigued then have a day off.’ Asked if he relished the prospect of ‘locking horns’ with O’Neill, an iconic Celtic manager before his own successful Parkhead tenure, Strachan insisted: ‘We’ll not be locking horns, it’s the players who’re playing. Martin, like me, doesn’t over-think football. Former Celtic bosses Strachan and Martin O'Neill (above) will lock horns at Parkhead next month . ‘We generally leave it to the players. We give them an idea of how to play and then let them get on with it.’ O’Neill’s assistant Roy Keane will also be in the technical area after turning down the Celtic manager’s job prior to Ronny Deila’s appointment. In his recently published autobiography, the Irish icon claimed he joined the Scottish champions for a short spell as a player to ‘spite’ then manager Strachan after sensing he was indifferent to his arrival. Keane also expressed irritation that Strachan allowed him to quit Celtic with a hip problem without offering up a fight for him to stay. The Scotland boss has shared a television studio with Keane since the Parkhead episode and dismissed talk of added spice, insisting: ‘Not at all. It’s not even a second thought. Former Celtic midfielder Roy Keane will be in the Irish dugout for emotional encounter . ‘We have spoken about bits and bobs from our time at Celtic in the last three years with ITV. We just laugh at things. ‘You need to take into account how he wrote the book. He was sitting smiling when he told that story. ‘He laughs and so do the people round about him. There you go, it’s funny. He spoke to me about this before and I said: “I didn’t even know your hip was that bad.”’ Ireland’s equaliser against the world champions from John O’Shea provided another twist in a Euro 2016 qualifying group Strachan now regards as the hardest of them all. ‘If you look at the games so far you can say: “Where did that result come from?” That’s just the way it’s going to be. Republic of Ireland are unbeaten in Group D after John O'Shea's last-gasp equaliser in Germany . ‘Like I said the other day, you never know where the big one is going to be. Ireland are in good fettle, good form, but we’re the same. ‘Poland beat Germany and people talk about them being fantastic but we’re happy with how we’re playing and we showed it didn’t matter to us how they did on Saturday. We were next on and we felt good about it.’ Anticipating his own return to Celtic Park, Irish boss O’Neill said: ‘I will take a wee bit of time to think about it. Scotland are on a good run at the moment, they really are, they’re playing with plenty of confidence. ‘Gordon (Strachan) has them playing well and he’s been involved with them for a couple of seasons. I don’t know what their reaction to us getting a late goal against Germany is but it keeps our momentum going.’","Scotland face the Republic of Ireland at Parkhead next month .

"With Roy Hodgson's squad preparing for their third Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia, Sportsmail takes a closer look at the Three Lions' next opponents. England have played Estonia just twice - during the Euro 2008 qualifying campaign - but have an aggregate scoreline of 6-0 after two 3-0 wins. In June 2007 Steve McClaren's side beat them in Tallinn thanks to goals from Joe Cole, Peter Crouch and Michael Owen before Shaun Wright-Phillips, Wayne Rooney and an own goal helped them to a win at Wembley four months later. Joe Cole (second from left) is congratulated by (from left to right) David Beckham, Wes Brown and Ledley King after scoring against Estonia in June, 2007 . Estonia have kept just six clean sheets in their last 20 games, but they do not concede too many goals. They let in an average of 1.2 per game in those 20 matches and conceded more than two goals in just one game - a 5-1 thrashing by Hungary in 2013. Lithuania's Saulius Mikoliunas (second from right) scores to secure a 1-0 win against Estonia in qualifying . The A. Le Coq Arena in Tallinn where England will play tomorrow is named after Estonia's biggest beer company, but in its early years in the 19th Century the company was actually run from London. England will face Estonia at the A. Le Coq Arena, which is named after the country's biggest beer company . Estonia's FIFA world ranking is 81. That's 63 places worse than England in 18th, but 127 places higher than San Marino, who are the joint-worst ranked side, along with Bhutan. Several England players and fans are likely to be calling home from Estonia this weekend using online video service Skype. The company was in fact created by Estonian software developers in Tallinn. Despite Estonia's lowly world ranking, it won't be all easy for England. The hosts have won four and drawn four of their last 10 home games. They have lost just twice, a 2-0 defeat by Turkey in 2013 and a 2-0 loss to Finland earlier this year.

"Two goals from Milivoje Novakovic earned Slovenia a crucial win in Lithuania to blow open the top of Group E in Euro 2016 qualifying. The hosts had won both of their previous games but they were no match for the visitors, who were fresh from a surprise win over Switzerland last time out. Jasmin Kurtic almost gave Slovenia an early before Lithuiania's Fiodor Cernych had a solid effort for the home team.

He put Slovenia in complete control less than five minutes later, converting Kevin Kampl's low cross from the left. Srecko Katanec's side were happy to sit back and soak up pressure in the second half and that's exactly what they did. The hosts, who had the opportunity to draw level with England on nine points with a win, failed to trouble the visitors goalkeeper as Slovenia cruised to their second victory in three games. The result leaves both teams on six points, three behind the Three Lions who narrowly beat Estonia 1-0 in Tallinn.

"Jonny Wilkinson's 17-year career ended in glory on Saturday night when he kicked 15 points to help Toulon to an 18-10 victory over Castres in the Top 14 final at the Stade  de France. And the World Cup winner delivered a trademark drop goal as a fitting reminder of his most famous kick which earned England success against Australia in 2003. Wilkinson last night landed the drop goal to go alongside three penalty goals in the first half and one after the interval. Trademark: Wilkinson kicked a field goal along with four penalties in the last game of his 17-year career . Double: Toulon celebrate the club's first Top 14 title since 1992 a week after their Heineken Cup win . Toulon’s final points came from Delon Armitage after Wilkinson decided the kick was out of his range. This . success completes a magnificent final season for the 35-year-old as . Toulon, the club he joined from Newcastle in 2009, also won the Heineken . Cup last week, against Saracens, in Cardiff. A . ferocious first half was dominated by the kicking of Wilkinson whose . three penalty goals and that drop goal had edged Toulon into a 12-10 . lead. Castres had little possession and only kept in touch thanks to a try off a counter-attack led by Scotland wing Max Evans. Final fling: Fly-half Wilkinson gets his left arm free for an offload in the French domestic final . Beloved: The Toulon fans give the England star a hero's send-off . Evans started and finished the move in the 11th minute which put Castres ahead after Wilkinson’s opening penalty goal. The . try also caused the match to erupt as Armitage, the Toulon full-back, . and Castres’ lead player Rory Kockott had a scuffle after Evans had . grabbed the ball to touch down. Kockott added the conversion, but he later missed three penalty goal attempts in contrast to the perfection of Wilkinson. A tetchy and nervous second half produced a penalty for Wilkinson and the late kick from Armitage. Contrast: Castres' kicker Rory Kockott missed three penalties as his side failed to repeat last year's upset win . Wilkinson . will join Toulon’s coaching staff next season, but he admits he is . unsure of how he will feel about ending his playing days. ‘That’s . the unknown for me, that’s the difficult bit — not really knowing if . I’m looking forward to it,’ he said in the build-up to the final in . Paris. In honour of Wilkinson, ‘God Save The Queen’ was played over the public address system when the final whistle went. Wilkinson said: ‘It’s impossible to say how I feel. I never thought when I joined Toulon we would have such success.’","Wilkinson kicked four penalties and a field goal in his last game of rugby .

They are just two of 60 bonobos at Lola ya Bonobo Sanctuary in the Democratic Republic of Congo. While the bonobos are under protection from staff members, at the sanctuary they are free to live as close to nature as possible by foraging for food themselves, picking their own mates and developing the survival strategies like avoiding poisonous snakes that they would need in the wild.

"England captain Wayne Rooney believes it is vitally important to start the European Championship qualifying campaign with a positive result in Switzerland. Just 76 days after their disastrous World Cup campaign came to an end, thoughts have turned to the Three Lions' next major tournament in France. A failure of even more epic proportions than Brazil looks necessary to make it out of Group E, although Roy Hodgson's side face their toughest match first. Preparation: Rooney leads his England team-mates through their paces at St George's Park . Leader: Rooney was appointed as England captain after Steven Gerrard retired from international football . Switzerland are ranked ninth in the world and are favourites at the bookmakers to win Monday's encounter at St Jakob-Park - something Rooney knows they cannot let happen. 'It is important to start the qualifying campaign off with a good result,' he said. 'It is important to try and win the game, but I think not to get beat and give Switzerland the upper hand from the first game is vital.' Understandably, there is a lot of doom and gloom around the England team in the wake of the World Cup. The public's apathy was highlighted by the fact Wednesday's 1-0 friendly win against Norway attracted Wembley's lowest crowd for an international since the stadium's opening in 2007. Furthermore, the 40,181 that did turn up were hardly wowed as the England display lacked inspiration and quality. Celebrate: Rooney pumps his fist after opening the scoring on his debut as captain against Norway . Bang: Rooney smashed home the penalty at a far-from-full Wembley to give England the win . However, Rooney is confident that good times are around the corner, pointing to the spirit and excitement brought by the performance in the World Cup opener against Italy, even if the game in Manaus ended in defeat. 'It's exciting times,' he said. 'The Italy and Uruguay games were disappointing results, but I thought we did well in both games. 'It could have gone either way, but we lost and we're out. We played some great attacking football. 'The lads who were at that tournament have gained vital experience from the tournament.' The pressure is now on such players to step up to the plate, with the retirement Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole compounded by a raft of injuries. Hard task: Rooney reckons England will need to win in Switzerland - and it's their toughest game . On his toes: Rooney looked sharp in England training, showing his less experienced team mates the way . Those problems have worsened further in recent days, with West Brom goalkeeper Ben Foster and uncapped Newcastle midfielder Jack Colback forced to withdraw from the squad. Things got worse still on Friday, when Daniel Sturridge sustained a thigh complaint in training. After a scan, the 25-year-old returned to Liverpool for treatment, further reducing their options for the match in Basle. Posting via his account, @D-Sturridge, he said: 'Heartbroken soul right now believe me. Hopefully be back soon fighting fit for LFC. Nothing worse than being injured. My heads gone' Hope: Captain Rooney will hope he can grab another goal to give England a dream start in Basel .","Wayne Rooney believes England have to get qualifiers off to a good start .

"A solicitor worried about paying his children’s private school fees jumped in front of a train and killed himself, an inquest heard. Vincent Buffoni, 49, was spending up to £30,000 a year to send Matthew, 14, to elite Charterhouse, and extra to send Francesca, ten, to a prep school. But the law firm he owned had been hit by the recession, and he had remortgaged the family home to raise £60,000 to continue paying for his children’s education. Early this year Mr Buffoni, an old boy of Marlborough College, contemplated suicide – writing a farewell note to his family and taking out a life insurance policy – but decided against it, the inquest heard. The elite Charterhouse School, where Vincent Buffoni, an old boy of Marlborough College, had sent his 14-year-old son Matthew . Lambeth North tube station, where the Oxford graduate threw himself under a train (file photo) Then, in May, he leapt in front of a . train at a London station. Southwark Coroner’s Court in London was told . that immigration law specialist Mr Buffoni, an Oxford graduate, founded . Vincent Buffoni and Co in 1994. As . the recession took its toll on his business he suffered depression and . anxiety. He had also been upset by the suicide of his brother Peter . three years earlier. One . morning in May Mr Buffoni left home in Woking, Surrey, and took the . train to Waterloo, from where he usually travelled to his office in . Islington, North London, by tube. But instead he went to Lambeth North and lingered on the platform, PC Steve Tucker told the court. PC Tucker said: ‘The next train entered the station and he jumped down on to the tracks and into its path. ‘The train driver immediately applied the emergency brake, but was completely powerless to stop.’ Mr . Buffoni’s wife Nicola, 50, said he had been taking anti-depressants for . around a year before his death and had also been on prescription . sleeping tablets, to which he feared he had become addicted. In February he had asked to be admitted to a psychiatric treatment centre for his own safety, she told the court. Mrs Buffoni added: ‘His business had been hit by the recession and he was very concerned about our financial situation. ‘Our children are at private schools and we have been very careful with money. To ensure our son could complete his education we had taken out an additional loan of £60,000 secured on our house. ‘He continued insisting we would have to sell our house and send our children to state school in order to survive on a dwindling cash pot.’ But Mr Buffoni’s sister Clare said his mood had improved in the days before his death after he started a course of the anti-depressant venlafaxine. 'He told me that he felt his brain had clicked back into gear,' she said. Mr Buffoni was worried over the financial performance of his law firm of the same name . She said she feared the new medication could have been responsible for triggering suicidal impulses, but doctors told the inquest it had been given in accordance with guidelines. Coroner Sarah Ormond-Walshe said there was insufficient evidence to record a verdict of suicide, and instead concluded Mr Buffoni had killed himself while the balance of his mind was disturbed. The coroner said: 'Mr Buffoni must have suddenly had some black thoughts. 'He got off the train, waited for another train and jumped in from of that moving train and died instantly. 'It does appear to have been a very impulsive, sudden and unexpected thought that passed through his brain. 'Although there was a note it was written some time earlier and there doesn't appear to have been any planning of this event whatsoever.'","Vincent Buffoni, 48, had concerns over family's finances after his law firm was hit by the recession .

"Nintendo has unveiled a new 'Miiverse' social network which will work with its upcoming Wii U consoles - and revealed that the service will also work on mobiles . Nintendo has unveiled a new 'Miiverse' social network which will work with its upcoming Wii U consoles - and revealed that the service will also work on mobiles. The news marks a major turnaround for the company, which has never made games for devices from other companies in the past. Nintendo has been slow to adopt online gaming, but is building the service into its upcoming Wii U to compete with rivals such as Apple. The success of smartphones such as Apple's iPhone has been seen as key to Nintendo's declining profits - the company posted its first-ever annual loss this year. Nintendo's new Wii U console will be in shops in Europe, Japan and America by the end of 2012. The new Wii U console is said to be . twice as powerful as Xbox 360, according to the latest rumours, and . features a tablet-style controller with a built-in screen. The new online 'world' Miiverse brings Nintendo into line with console rivals Sony and Microsoft, both of whom offer online services via their PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles. ‘Nintendo is falling behind its rivals in the online gaming . area. The idea of entering the field is good, but the question is whether the . company can generate profits,’ said Hajime Nakajima, a wholesale trader at Iwai . Cosmo Securities. Debuted a year ago, the much anticipated Wii U console has . so far received a frosty reception from investors worried that the hardware . will struggle to find buyers in a $78.5 billion industry that has become a . target for smartphone and tablet PC makers such as Apple. The new Nintendo Wii U gaming console is displayed on a video screen during a news conference at the E3 Gaming Convention in Los Angeles last year - full details are widely expected to be revealed at this year's show . The 'second screen' now also sports classic dual-joystick controls, hinting that Nintendo may be hunting the hardcore gamer market with their new console . Nintendo's hi-tech new Wii U console is likely to be much more expensive than the previous incarnation, say analysts - and many see the HD machine as a 'last chance'. Nintendo may disclose the price . and launch date of the Wii U at the event. Nintendo may have to sell the new console for as much as . $350 to break even, reckons Nanako Imazu, an analyst for CLSA in Tokyo. That's . $100 more than it charged for the Wii in 2006 and would be more expensive than . both the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, which can be picked up for less than $300. Nintendo shares dropped by as much as 3.2 percent early on . Monday - to their lowest since November 2003. After revealing the Wii U a year ago, Nintendo stock has . more than halved, and is currently well below its level when the Wii was first . launched in 2006. ‘The market has begun to discount the possibility that the . situation is going to get worse after this year's E3,’ Mizuho Securities . analyst Takeshi Koyama said before Iwata's broadcast. Nintendo, which last year launched the 3DS handheld games . machine, reported a first-ever operating loss, of 37.3 billion yen ($477 . million), in the year to end-March - a reverse that Iwata in April admitted was . under par for Nintendo. ‘Some people may wonder if Wii U is a simple evolution of . Wii or something completely different. I think maybe the best answer is both,’ Nintendo President Satoru Iwata said in a webcast ahead of the E3 videogame . industry trade show in Los Angeles where he will unveil the final version of . the Wii U. The addition of Miiverse suggests Nintendo - which started . out in 1889 making playing cards in the back streets of Kyoto before gaining . prominence as the creator of the ‘Super Mario’ franchise - may be relying on . online content delivery to underpin hardware sales through its new Nintendo . Network, a similar strategy to Sony and Apple. However, Iwata has been slower than others to take on online . social and content delivery platforms, and has a lot of ground to make up to . catch up with the millions of subscribers plugged into PlayStation 3's network, . iTunes and Microsoft's Xbox. In his webcast, Iwata showed off a video chat function and . functions to allow users to message and share pictures and other content. ‘Not . only can it connect people in a better way within the same living room, but it . also connects people (from) living room to living room in a much more . compelling way,’ he said. The Nintendo boss promised that Miiverse in the future would . be made available to subscribers on smartphones and other mobile devices, a . first tentative step by Nintendo to offer services on devices built by other . companies. In a more traditional hardware bid to attract consumers, . Iwata said the Wii U's tablet touchscreen controller would come with a built-in . joystick, called a GamePad, that would double as a TV remote, while a pro . controller for the games machine would be available for hardcore gamers. ‘All these things sound like they're playing catch-up to the . Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3,’ Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, . said after Iwata's webcast.","New 'Miiverse' social network will connnect Wii U consoles .

"Malta's players were left somewhat amused when a Linkin Park song nearly replaced their national anthem during their friendly with Slovakia on Thursday. With the Maltese internationals standing ready to sing their hearts out, the DJ at the MSK Zilina Stadium accidentally played the first few seconds of the Linkin Park song 'Numb' instead. And as the inevitable laughter ensued, the person responsible quickly managed to rectify his error, managing to spare some blushes.

"Shaun Maloney believes Scotland can shock World Cup winners Germany in Dortmund on Sunday night and secure the country’s greatest result in a generation. The recent history of the national team has featured fine home and away wins over France under Walter Smith and then Alex McLeish in the Euro 2008 qualification stage. Under Berti Vogts, a Euro 2004 play-off victory over Holland was achieved at Hampden in 2003, before a crushing 6-0 reverse in Amsterdam. Challenge: A win against Germany would be Scotland's biggest in over a decade in Maloney's eyes . Champions: Germany were comfortably the best side in Brazil where they won the World Cup this summer . Given Germany are fresh from winning the World Cup in Brazil in such scintillating fashion, however, Maloney believes that for Scotland to return with three points from their opening Euro 2016 qualifier would arguably represent the nation’s finest result since beating England 1-0 at Wembley in 1999 in a Euro 2000 play-off second leg. The Wigan winger said: ‘It would be as big a result as this group has had. It may be similar to when we beat France and they were flying at the time (losing the 2006 World Cup Final on penalties to Italy). I also remember that play-off game against Holland in 2003 — that was a huge result at the time, too. ‘But being away from home against the World Champions makes it even harder for us. ‘So I think, if it happens, it would be as big a result as the team has managed in the last 15 years.’ Decisive: Mario Gotze scores the winning goal in the World Cup final against Argentina . Improving: Scotland's form under Gordon Strachan has been a significant improvement on recent years . Euro 2016 sees the tournament enlarged from 16 to 24 teams, thanks to a proposal spearheaded by the late former SFA chief executive David Taylor. The new-look qualifying process sees the nine group winners, nine runners-up and the best-finishing third team qualify automatically alongside hosts France. The remaining third-placed teams play-off for the four remaining slots at the tournament. And Maloney feels when you factor in that plus the national team’s form under Gordon Strachan over the past 12 months, Scotland have never had a better chance to reach a major finals and end their exile since last appearing at the France ’98 World Cup. ‘Is this our best chance yet? Yes,’ he said. ‘I think coming into the qualifying matches our form is as good as we could have hoped for, really. There were moments under Walter Smith and Alex McLeish when we came very close to qualification. 'Big result': A win against the World Champions would eclipse anything Scotland have achieved recently . Right time: With an expanded tournament Scotland know it's now or never for major tournament qualification . ‘That was an opportunity missed. But the form we are in now, considering where we were before, is very good. ‘Losing to Wales at home (in the World Cup qualifiers in March 2013) in terms of how we got beaten was a real low point. ‘But the way we’ve come on since then and across the whole last 12 months in particular, we couldn’t really ask for much more (ahead of the new campaign).’","Scotland face World Champions Germany in Euro 2016 qualifier .

"As the England players  struggle to come to terms with their disastrous World Cup campaign, Wayne Rooney has apologised to the nation for the performances. He has also pledged his support for Roy Hodgson as England manager, and insisted that England need to become less ‘honest’ in their approach to the game. Speaking in the wake of his team’s elimination, Rooney said. ‘The fans have been incredible to us, flying all this way and giving us the support they have. Back home there were kids staying up late and watching the games. Out here, the fans have been amazing. ‘It’s not the easiest place for them to come, so we appreciate the efforts they have made and we’re sorry for not going through. VIDEO Scroll down for Wayne Rooney: We prepared as well as we could for World Cup . Show of support: Wayne Rooney has said he will be backing Holland at the World Cup after England's exit . Heartfelt: Rooney was absolutely devastated by the result . Upset: Rooney had apologised to England fans via social media earlier in the day . Popular: The England striker's Facebook post has already received over 100,000 'likes' ‘We’ve given everything. We’ve . dedicated our lives to this tournament and unfortunately we haven’t . succeeded. We appreciate everything they’ve done for us. Hopefully, one . day soon, we’ll give them something to smile about.’ His . support for Hodgson was unequivocal. ‘Roy is a fantastic manager and . fantastic person in my eyes, and he’s the right man to take us forward,’ he said. ‘He’s brought a . lot of youth and excitement into the team. It hasn’t worked out in this . tournament, but he’s certainly got his plans set in place in the next . two years, and we’ll try and execute those plans. ‘If . you look over the previous two or three tournaments, we’ve not attacked . teams. We’ve been cautious. This time, we’ve had a go. In other . tournaments we’ve wondered if we could’ve done things differently once . we were out, but we’ve had a go here. But it’s not gone our way. ‘Roy’s . hurting too. Of course he is. We all do really. It’s hard to take. There’s no way round it. It’s tough on us, tough on the fans, but it’s . something we have to try and move on from quickly and put right.’ He . insisted one of the major lessons learned was for English foot-ball to . become more street-wise: ‘You look at teams who have won the tournament . over previous years and you can see that nastiness in them. 'I think we . need to get that in us. Maybe we’re too honest, I feel, as a team. In . terms of Uruguay the other night, they stopped the game, they committed I . don’t know how many fouls ... clever fouls, really, to slow the game . down. ‘I think we’re a bit . honest in terms of the way we play. It’s small  margins. But those . small things can amount to a big thing in terms of staying in or going . out. If we can learn that quickly and adapt to that, I think we’ll do . better. ‘You see players . surrounding the referees — I’m not saying Uruguay did that — but I’m the . same now. I want to win the game. I got kicked 10 times and I don’t . think there was a yellow card given to an opponent. 'We try and be . honest, but maybe that’s a fault of ours. But we gave everything to try . and win. It hasn’t happened. It’s tough ... we have to stay strong and . try and improve.’ Gone: England were knocked out of the World Cup after failing to win their first two Group D games . Chance: Rooney's second half goal against Uruguay gave England hope before Luis Suarez scored the winner . At 28, . Rooney has played international football for 11 years and speaks with . the experience of three World Cups. The outstanding English player of . his generation, he is aware his remarkable talent has never found . adequate expression at the highest level. He is also aware that this . festival in Brazil may well have been his last chance, and he tried to . conceal his frustration. ‘It’s . difficult to sit here and say I enjoyed the tournament, because we’re . out. That’s it. We’re hurting. It’s tough going out of the  tournament . like that. We have to remember how we feel at this moment and use that . pain.’ Asked if there was . consolation in the fact he scored his first World Cup goal against . Uruguay, Rooney almost snorted: ‘I scored a goal, but we lost, we’re out . of the tournament. That’s all that matters. 'This team’s much bigger . than Wayne Rooney. I’m just a part of this team. It’s not through lack . of trying. We gave our all. We tried, but we didn’t succeed. It’s . football. It happens.’ It . was pointed out that Rooney ran more than anyone at this tournament. He . was not surprised. ‘I believe I’ve got many years left in me. I feel . good,’ he said. ‘We get . stats daily from training and games, and I’m always in the top two or . three. Sometimes it affects decision-making inside the box, being tired . from doing too much. 'Maybe I should run around a bit less! But playing . for your country, you want to try and do well and work for the team, . whether that’s up front, behind the forward or wide.’ Hope: England's team before they took on Italy, not knowing that they'd be out less than a week later . Hacker: Rooney's performance against the Italians was widely criticised . Assist: Rooney (left) set up Daniel Sturridge for England's opening goal of the tournament . Despite his stress on the team ethic, he has solid ambitions of  beating Sir Bobby Charlton’s record of 49 England goals. ‘Of . course,’ he said. ‘It’s within touching distance. I’ll be disappointed . if I don’t do it. I feel I’ve many years left. If I don’t get the 10 . goals to beat the record, I’ll have no one to blame but myself. It would . be a great achievement. But this is about the team. Collectively, we’re . disappointed. I don’t want to be talking about my chances of breaking . records when we’re all hurting.’ England . have four Euro qualifiers before Christmas. Did he believe the . supporters needed to be patient with the young team’s efforts? ‘We . have to start well because we want to be in the next tournament,’ he . said. ‘We just have to do well in those. The fans will see some exciting . football, but we have to turn that exciting football into results. That’s the plan, that’s the aim. ‘Roy . has moved us forward in my eyes since the previous tournament. I know . we haven’t progressed from the group, but he’s moved us forward. I know . it’s tough to say that or believe that now, but I’ve been in this squad . for over 10 years now and that’s being truthful and honest.’","Rooney claims he's 'absolutely devastated' by England's World Cup exit .

'When he arrived with the German national team, they didn't think it was a lot at the start,' the Gunners boss told Arsenal's website.

"Samoa Air has started to charge passengers for a plane seat according to how much they weigh. Under the new model passengers pay a fixed price per kilogram for the ticket price, which varies depending on the route length. Head of Samoa Air Chris Langton told Australia's ABC Radio that it was 'the fairest way of travelling.' New plans: Samoa Air has started to charge passengers according to how much they weigh . Under the pay by weight system passengers input their weight into the . online booking section of the Samoa Air website. Air Samoa's rates range from $1 (65p) to around $4.16 per kilogram reported News.com.au. 'People have always travelled on the basis of their seat but as many airline operators know airlines don't run on seats they run on weight and particularly the smaller the aircraft you are in the less variance you can accept in terms of the difference in weight between passengers,' Mr Langton told ABC radio. Decision: Head of Samoa Air Chris Langton told Australia's ABC Radio that it was 'the fairest way of travelling' Mr Langton said that families with children were now paying cheaper fares. 'There are no extra fees in terms of excess baggage or anything - it is just a kilo is a kilo is a kilo,' he said . Passengers can also add their baggage weight on - there  are no separate fees because of excess baggage. Samoa Air flies domestically and to American Samoa - it is thought the move could encourage other airlines to introduce similar policies. Airline seats are literally growing with demand and last year Airbus announced  that it will be providing extra-wide seats for overweight passengers as number of obese passengers creeps up. One third of the population are currently obese, with the figure expected to reach 42 per cent by 2030. Two 20-inch seats will be installed on each side of the aisle, sacrificing the space for three regular 18-inch seats on board the A320 - on Boeing aircraft standard seats are 17 inches. Extra-large passengers will be able to purchase extra-large seats at an added cost, which will likely prove lucrative to the air travel industry. Airlines could make as much as $3 million extra in profits over a 15-year period, according to the Huffington Post.","Head of Samoa Air said that it was 'the fairest way of travelling'

"Researchers found meeting someone face-to-face after looking at their Facebook photos increases arousal, which the study linked to social anxiety . One of the many benefits of Facebook is that it can connect people from all over the world - but instead of making us more open, it could be making us socially awkward and anxious. Researchers from Arizona studied how people reacted to meeting people face-to-face if they had previously interacted with them online. They found that during the face-to-face meeting, the participants experienced an increase in arousal, which the researchers linked to an increase in anxiety. 'The current tendency for people to use Facebook to 'lurk' or 'creep' on other people's profiles raised the question of what such activities do to change later face-to-face interactions, particularly among the socially anxious,' explained the researchers. To test this theory, researchers from the University of Benedictine at Mesa, led by Shannon Rauch, fitted 26 female students with electrodes that measure Galvanic skin response (GSR). These electrodes are used to measure changes in physiological arousal. Females were explicitly chosen because they are more likely to be Facebook users, claim the researchers, and they are more likely to experience greater social anxiety. All the participants were asked to complete an Interaction Anxiousness Scale (IAS) to test their respective levels of social anxiety. The students were later divided into four groups and asked to study and memorise the face of another female student in preparation for a facial recognition task. In the first group, participants had to study the other person’s face on a Facebook profile page.The second group was asked to study the person's face while she was in the same room. This graph shows the different in anxiety levels among participants. People who looked at photos on Facebook before meeting the person face-to-face, rather than vice versa, suffered an increase in anxiety, according to the skin responses. This was especially the case with participants who scored highly in a social anxiety test.

In the third group, participants were first shown the Facebook photos before meeting the person face-to-face. The . fourth group carried out the test the other way round, meeting the . student face-to-face before being shown photos on Facebook. Skin conductance levels were measured at several intervals throughout these tests. In the third group, participants were first shown the Facebook photos before meeting the person face-to-face. The fourth group carried out the test the other way round, meeting the student face-to-face before being shown photos on Facebook. Skin conductance levels were measured at several intervals throughout these tests. People who looked at photos on Facebook before meeting the student face-to-face suffered an increase in arousal, according to the skin responses. This was especially the case with participants who scored highly in the social anxiety test. The researchers claimed this was due to the fact looking at Facebook photos gave the participant’s time to compare themselves to the student. This can lead to feeling of inferiority, for example. ‘This self-presentation and social comparison concerns that would lead to heightened arousal when the stimulus person is present,’ wrote the study. ‘Initial Facebook exposure may not serve a protective function during a subsequent live exposure, but may lead to an increase in negative arousal.’ The findings confirm previous studies that found socially anxious people prefer online interactions. However, the study also recognised arousal can be associated with positive emotions and it could be possible encountering someone face-to-face after seeing their photos may lead to an increase in positive feelings . Alternatively, the change from Facebook to real life may have led to arousal because the socially anxious participants preferred the relative safety of Facebook and felt agitated when the switch was made. The findings confirm previous studies that found socially anxious people prefer online over face-to-face interactions. However, the researchers also recognised that physiological arousal can be associated with positive as well as negative emotions. They claim it could be possible that encountering someone face-to-face after seeing their photos on Facebook may lead to an increase in positive rather than negative arousal. A previous exposure, for example, may lead to excitement and even a desire to engage when the live encounter occurs. They added, however, that they would have expected to see increases in comfort and relief if this was the case and claimed more research needs to be carried out .","Researchers studied how online interaction affects face-to-face meetings .

'Most families wait until their baby is born to start making memories and traveling to places with them,' Dan said to ABC 13. 'We understood what it was and knew that our time with our son could be very limited, so we wanted to make the most of the time that we had with him.' The couple have named their son Shane Michael Haley and created a Facebook page so they could keep all their family and friends updated - it now has more than 100,000 people following.

Anencephaly occurs between the third and fourth weeks of pregnancy. During that time, the neural tube is supposed to close and fold over to form the brain and spinal cord of the fetus. This process fails to occur in anencephalic pregnancies, resulting in the absence of a large portion of the brain, skull and scalp. Babies born with anencephaly are usually blind, deaf, unconcious and unable to feel pain. They are usually stillborn but in rare cases they may survive longer. The rate of anencephaly is one or two per 10,000 births. The couple wrote on their Facebook page: . 'On April 10, 2014 Shane was diagnosed with a terminal neural tube defect called anencephaly. 'This occurs roughly in every 1 out of 5,500 pregnancies. 'The life expectancy of infants with anencephaly ranges from hours to days, with a few cases where children have survived more than a year. 'We are asking for your prayers and support and that God grants us as much time as possible with our beautiful son. 'Shane has already proven to us that each day must be lived to the fullest and that is exactly what our little family is doing. 'Follow us through our various adventures as we take Shane to some of our favorite childhood places.'

"Attacker: Soby John, 25, let himself into the drunk woman's hotel room where he raped her . A television star was raped in her hotel room by an Indian porter who was awaiting deportation, a court heard yesterday. Soby John, 25, was jailed for ten years after admitting breaking into the victim’s room at a top London hotel and forcing himself on her as she slept, in what the judge described as a ‘wicked’ attack. The star had been drinking heavily in a West End club with friends that evening and was ‘unable to defend herself’. John, who was living in Wembley,  had entered the UK on a student visa but it had expired and he was due to be deported back to India. He had been granted shift work at the hotel through an agency on the night of the attack last year. The court heard he used his position as a porter to get a copy of the electronic key to the victim’s room after seeing her stumbling in the corridor and being helped to bed by a female friend in the early hours of October 24. Lesley Jones, prosecuting, said John entered the victim’s room using the key and raped her as she lay in bed. She said: ‘(The victim) had woken during the night to find an Asian man on top of her having sex with her.’ The victim ‘felt immobilised and unable to defend herself’, she said, adding: ‘She said she felt his hand on her neck as she pushed him away but then she drifted into unconsciousness.’ After raping her, John took a photograph on her iPhone and intimate photographs of her on his own phone. In an attempt to make the rape appear consensual, he also sent a message from her phone to his, saying: ‘Hey John you enjoy me thanks’. Swabs taken from the victim matched John’s DNA, as did DNA taken from a pair of blue latex gloves left in the room which the court heard may have been used as a ‘crude’ condom. John admitted he had sex with the woman when police used information from hotel security to track him down at home, but denied rape in initial interviews. He changed his plea to guilty in February. Yesterday at Southwark Crown Court, defence counsel Peter Higginson said his client was ‘a naive young man, floundering in a culture which he hadn’t quite come to terms with’. He said John had no previous convictions in the UK or India, that he had always worked and had ‘not been a burden’ on the state. ‘It was a single, foolish act,’ he added. Jailed: Soby John, 25, was ordered to serve 10 years behind bars today by a judge sitting at Southwark Crown Court . Describing the offence as a ‘wicked rape’, Recorder of Westminster Judge Alistair McCreath said the victim had been left with ‘massive anxiety’ and ‘huge trust issues’, and was afraid to stay in hotels, go out alone or be left on her own. Breaking into the ‘private space’ of her hotel room ‘was effectively a burglary’, the judge said, and taking the photos had added to her ‘humiliation’. Sentencing him to ten years, he told the defendant: ‘I recognise you are relatively young and you were brought up in a different culture from the culture of the place where this terrible offence took place. ‘But whatever cultural values you were brought up with, I do not for a moment accept they condone the act of non-consensual intercourse with a woman who was so drunk as to be insensible.’ The court heard John will be deported to India once he has served his sentence.","Soby John, 25, let himself into the victim's room using his staff keycard .

"Customers are going nuts for the latest pastry delicacy – squirrel pies. Family firm Something Nice is selling 150 of the unusual snacks a week. Owner Phil Walmsley, 46, said his wife Katherine, 53, came up with the idea after the business began producing pies with exotic fillings a year ago. He added: ‘We started with kangaroo, crocodile, elk, buffalo and wagyu beef. We found a niche in the market. There are plenty of grey squirrels – they’re classified as vermin and it’s legal to kill them. 'Gamey': Phil Walmsley, 46, hunts the squirrels himself, then sells his pies for £2.50 each . Unusual: Mr Walmsley's company, Something Nice, also makes elk, buffalo and crocodile pie . ‘In a pie, it has similar characteristics to rabbit – it is a dark meat and very gamey. People come back for more because it has an excellent flavour – deep and rich.’ Squirrel pie was a delicacy in Victorian times and may be enjoying a revival because of attempts to save the grey squirrels’ less aggressive red cousins from extinction. Mr Warmsley, who shoots the squirrels and sells the pies for £2.50, said: ‘Killing more grey squirrels could give the red squirrel a chance to repopulate.’ 'You do get the odd person who asks how I can do this to such a lovely . creature, but being at the top of the food chain we have the luxury of being able to eat what we want and they are vermin.'

"In his final words to the ones he loved, James Foley thanked his family for getting him through his almost two year hostage ordeal, saying the memories of home 'takes me away and happiness fills my heart'. The 40-year-old journalist, who was beheaded by Islamic State (IS) militants, was not allowed to send letters from his hostage cell in Syria, but asked a fellow hostage who was due to be released to commit a letter to memory. Danish photojournalist Daniel Rye Ottosen, 25, spent 13 months imprisoned alongside Foley and, when released in June, released in June, his first call was to Foley’s mum Diane, when he dictated the lengthy letter to her. Diane and her husband John Foley have now released the letter in full on a Facebook page set up in their late son's honor. The letter was posted following a memorial for Foley in his hometown of Rochester, New Hampshire, on Sunday. Scroll down to read the full letter and video . Last words: James Foley dictated his final message to a fellow hostage, who memorized its contents and then told it to Foley's mother upon his release.

'I know you are thinking of me and praying for me. And I am so thankful,' Foley said. 'I feel you all especially when I pray. I pray for you to stay strong and to believe. I really feel I can touch you even in this darkness when I pray.' Foley described the conditions of his cell in the letter, saying he was held in a cell with 18 others, Sky News reported. They passed the time talking about movies, sport and trivia, and managed to find ways of playing chess, checkers and Risk. 'They have been a huge help. We repeat stories and laugh to break the tension,' he said. 'I have had weak and strong days. 'We are so grateful when anyone is freed; but of course, yearn for our own freedom. 'We try to encourage each other and share strength.' The letter, which includes messages for different family members, ends with Mr Foley addressing his grandmother. 'Grammy, please take your medicine, take walks and keep dancing. I plan to take you out to Margarita's when I get home,' he said. 'Stay strong because I am going to need your help to reclaim my life.' Daniel Rye Ottosen, pictured, spent 13 months imprisoned with James Foley . Foley's mother flew to Copenhagen the week before her son was executed to meet with Ottosen, according to the boss of the Boston-based online news organization Foley was working for when he was snatched in November 2012. Phil Balboni, CEO of GlobalPost, told how Diane developed a ‘close bond’ with the families of other hostages still in captivity and met up with released hostages from France and Spain who had been held by the same group of British jihadis dubbed The Beatles. ‘She went to Copenhagen to meet with the Danish journalist who memorized the letter. He provided new details of his time with Jim. All of the released hostages spoke of Jim’s courage. He was subjected to the most abuse and torture because he was American but they never broke his spirit. ‘Diane has become extremely close to the families of other Western hostages who are still in captivity. They share a special and very close bond.’ Balboni described Diane as ‘a woman on a mission’ to save her son from the moment the first email arrived from his captors on November 26, 2013. ‘The email was sent to me and to Jim’s brother Michael. It was brief. It said “We’re holding James. We’re prepared to negotiate for his release. We need money – FAST.” ‘They had all of Jim’s cellphone contacts which is how they got our email addresses. ‘There were more emails, five or six in all. They gave us the opportunity to ask proof-of-life questions, obscure family references impossible for anyone but Jim to answer. That was in early December, 2013. We felt great hope.’ In one email, the terrorists made their sole demand – for $135 million and the release of Muslim prisoners held by the US. But then the terrorists stopped communicating.

And I am so thankful. I feel you all especially when I pray. I pray for you to stay strong and to believe. I really feel I can touch you even in this darkness when I pray. Eighteen of us have been held together in one cell, which has helped me. We have had each other to have endless long conversations about movies, trivia, sports. We have played games made up of scraps found in our cell…we have found ways to play checkers, Chess, and Risk… and have had tournaments of competition, spending some days preparing strategies for the next day’s game or lecture. The games and teaching each other have helped the time pass. They have been a huge help. We repeat stories and laugh to break the tension. I have had weak and strong days. We are so grateful when anyone is freed; but of course, yearn for our own freedom. We try to encourage each other and share strength. We are being fed better now and daily. We have tea, occasional coffee. I have regained most of my weight lost last year. I think a lot about my brothers and sister. I remember playing Werewolf in the dark with Michael and so many other adventures. I think of chasing Mattie and T around the kitchen counter. It makes me happy to think of them. If there is any money left in my bank account, I want it to go to Michael and Matthew. I am so proud of you, Michael and thankful to you for happy childhood memories and to you and Kristie for happy adult ones. And big John, how I enjoyed visiting you and Cress in Germany. Thank you for welcoming me. I think a lot about RoRo and try to imagine what Jack is like. I hope he has RoRo’s personality! And Mark… so proud of you too Bro.

The special moments keep me hopeful. Katie, so very proud of you. You are the strongest and best of us all!! I think of you working so hard, helping people as a nurse. I am so glad we texted just before I was captured. I pray I can come to your wedding…. now I am sounding like Grammy!! Grammy, please take your medicine, take walks and keep dancing.

"A seven-month-old girl was taken to hospital Saturday by concerned parents after an area just below her jaw swelled up to the size of one and a half golf balls with a pimple on top. After initially diagnosing an infection, doctors were shocked when they discovered a two-inch-long black feather had got lodged underneath Mya Whittington's  skin. Aaron and Emma Whittington first took their nearly seven-month-old daughter to Hutchinson Regional Medical Center, Kansas on Saturday after the area below her jaw swelled up. The marked area on Mya's neck shows the size of the original swollen infected area caused by a feather that she ingested from a pillow . Right for plucking: A two-inch-long black feather emerges from Mya's swollen face . 'They thought it was a swollen gland,' Aaron Whittington said. The hospital administered an antibiotic and sent the family home. Mya's grandmother took her back to the hospital after a 'pimple' appeared on the swollen area, which had now grown to the size of about one and a half golf balls, Aaron Whittington said. 'She looked like Quasimodo,' her father said. The physician suspected a staph infection on her lymph nodes. A doctor broke the pimple to try to drain it and drew marks on her face to measure whether the swelling increased. The intravenous antibiotics were continued. On Monday, the doctor on rounds scraped off a scab that formed. After the doctor left, the Whittingtons noted what appeared to be a string or stick emerging from the spot. They left it alone, since the doctor hadn't done anything to it, Aaron said. The two-inch feather pulled from Mya's neck which made its exit through a swollen infected pimple on her neck . Brave baby: The swelling on Mya's neck would have caused an immense amount of pain, but the brave girl cried mostly only when nurses have poked her . When Mya's pediatrician visited later that evening, however, she asked what it was. She then put on a pair of gloves and plucked a two-inch-long black feather from the swollen area of the child's neck. They suspect, Whittington said, that the baby swallowed or inhaled the feather, which apparently pierced the inside of her cheek or throat and then, over time, her body forced it out the other way. The Whittingtons had a down pillow on their bed, but Mya wasn't normally on it, and it's been in the couple's laundry room for months, Emma Whittington said. It's headed for the trash.

"Charged: Gabriel Quintero, 18, and three underage friends have been charged with animal cruelty . Police have arrested four teens, age 18, 17 and 16, for the fowl massacre of nearly 1,000 chickens that were bludgeoned to death with golf clubs and other blunt instruments at an industrial farm in California's Central Valley. The 'psychopaths' broke into a Foster Farms chicken house near Fresno on September 20 and mutilated 920 chickens overnight. The company and a local animal rights group both offered cash rewards for information leading to the perpetrators. The public push payed off. Just hours after police publicized the attack, detectives were alerted to chatter on social media that identified the suspects. Fresno County sheriff's deputies arrested 18-year-old Gabriel Quintero, two 17-year-olds and a 16-year-old on Wednesday. Police say they pulled back a side wall of a chicken house then played 18 holes with the helpless fowl inside. All four are charged with burglary and felony animal cruelty. The three juveniles were taken to Fresno Juvenile Justice Center. Detectives discovered a piece of a golf club that the burglars had left behind. 'Psychopathic behavior, it’s sick behavior. And people who will do this, it can definitely lead to other things,' Fresno County sheriff's deputy Chris Curtice told KPIX-TV. Foster Farms said the birds were worth about $5,000. 'This appears to be a random act of violence. It is the express policy of Foster Farms to treat its birds humanely and with compassion. Any intentional act to the contrary is unacceptable,' the company said in a statement. Workers say they were horrified by the mess left  from the mutilated birds. 'It’s crazy that someone would break into the chicken shed to kill them. It’s just crazy,' employee Antonio Puentes told KPIX.

"A pharmacist who worked for a Massachusetts company blamed for a 2012 deadly nationwide meningitis outbreak has pleaded not guilty. Glenn Adam Chin entered his plea to a mail fraud charge at a brief hearing Thursday in federal court in Boston. The 46-year-old was arrested last week trying to board a flight to Hong Kong. Prosecutors say he oversaw the sterile clean rooms at the New England Compounding Center in Framingham, where tainted steroids blamed for the outbreak were made. Chin, a supervisory pharmacist, is accused of participating in a scheme to fraudulently cause one lot to be labeled as injectable, meaning it was sterile and fit for human use. The drug was shipped to Michigan Pain Specialists in Brighton, Michigan, and injected into patients. As a result, 217 patients contracted fungal meningitis, and 15 died. Blamed: Glenn Adam Chin entered a not guilty plea on Thursday, after his arrest last week in connection to a deadly outbreak of meningitis in 2012 . Deadly: Chin has been blamed for the death of 15 people who caught meningitis from an unsterilized drug Chi approved for shipment. Pictured above outside court on Thursday . About 750 people in 20 states developed meningitis — an inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord — or other infections. Michigan, Tennessee and Indiana were hit the hardest. Chin, from Canton, was arrested at Logan International Airport. He was charged with one count of mail fraud, but federal prosecutors said it is part of a larger criminal investigation of Chin and others. He is the first person to be charged in the inquiry. Chin's attorney, Paul Shaw, said his client was at the airport with his family because he planned to attend a wedding in his wife's native Hong Kong, not to flee the country. 'This was a publicity stunt,' Shaw said of the arrest. Prosecutors said Chin supervised the clean rooms and was involved in compounding the contaminated methylprednisolone acetate, or MPA, that caused the outbreak. An affidavit filed in US District Court alleges that Chin participated in a scheme to fraudulently cause one lot of MPA to be labeled as injectable, meaning that it was sterile and fit for human use. The lot was shipped to Michigan Pain Specialists in Brighton, Michigan. Chin is accused of failing to sterilize or test equipment at the facility, pictured here in 2012, and fraudulently labeling MPA steroids manufactured in moldy rooms as safe for injection . Shuttered: The New England Compounding Center gave up its license and filed for bankruptcy protection over meningitis lawsuits . After receiving the drug, Michigan Pain Specialists doctors injected it into patients, believing it to be safe. As a result, 217 patients contracted fungal meningitis, and 15 of them died, according to the affidavit. In the affidavit, a special agent with the Food and Drug Administration said Chin used numerous unsafe practices while producing the medication, including improper sterilization and improper testing. Agent Benedict Celso said that Chin, in order to conceal the unsafe practices, 'instructed pharmacy technicians to mislabel medication to indicate it was properly sterilized and tested.' Celso also said the compounding center failed to properly sterilize and maintain its clean rooms. He said Chin instructed pharmacy technicians to 'fraudulently complete cleaning logs' at the end of the month 'purporting to show the rooms were properly cleaned and maintained when in fact they had not been.' Arrested: Chin, left, walks with his attorney Paul Shaw, right, after appearing in federal court last week . He said the pharmacy's own testing showed the repeated presence of bacteria and mold within its clean rooms on a weekly basis throughout 2012. A woman whose husband contracted meningitis after getting a tainted injection at the Michigan clinic welcomed the criminal charge. 'They should take every one of them and put the same contaminated injection in their back,' said Iona 'Nell' Rye, of Maybee, Michigan. She said her 74-year-old husband, Alfred, had been in excellent health before he received the injection in August 2012. He has recovered but still has some residual effects, she said. 'He doesn't have the same strength. He's off balance,' she said. The New England Compounding Center, based in Framingham, just west of Boston, gave up its license and filed for bankruptcy protection after it was flooded with hundreds of lawsuits from people who received tainted steroid injections. Attorneys for its creditors late last year announced a preliminary settlement with a victim compensation fund worth more than $100 million. The contaminated medication was discovered in the fall of 2012. Regulators later found a host of potential contaminants at the company's Framingham plant, including standing water, mold, water droplets and dirty equipment.","Glenn Adam Chin, 46, is accused of approving the shipment of an unsterilized steroid which led to 217 people contracting fungal meningitis .

"A pair of Pakistani women have made history as the first Muslim lesbian couple to get married in the UK. Rehana Kausar, 34, and Sobia Kamar, 29, made history when they tied the knot in a register office civil ceremony, then immediately applied for political asylum after they were wed, claiming their lives would be in danger if they returned to their native country. Watched by their solicitors and two friends, the pair wore traditional white bridal dresses when they were married in Leeds, West Yorkshire. Defiance: Muslim Lesbians Rehana Kausar (left), 34, and Sobia Kamar, 29, from Pakistan, married in Leeds earlier this month, despite death threats . The pair, from the Lahore and Mirpur regions of Pakistan, said they had received death threats from opponents in Pakistan - where homosexual acts are illegal and considered against Islam. And since news of their wedding earlier this month spread, the pair claimed they had even received death threats from the UK. Before the service, even the registrar advised the couple to give serious thought to their decision to marry because of some Muslims’ views on homosexuality. Ms Kausar, a master's degree holder in economics from Punjab University (pictured), both came to the UK to study business and health care management . Kausar said: 'This country allows us rights and it’s a very personal decision that we have taken. 'It’s no one’s business as to what we do with our personal lives. 'The problem with Pakistan is that everyone believes he is in charge of other people’s lives and can best decide about the morals of others but that’s not the right approach and we are in this state because of our clergy who have hijacked our society which was once a tolerant society and respected individuals’ freedoms.' The pair married at the register office located at Leeds Town Hall. They have lived in South Yorkshire as a couple for a year . Ms Kamar, speaking to the Birmingham Mail, described her partner as her 'soul mate' and said the two women were deeply in love. Pakistani law does not recognise same-sex marriages and there are no laws to stop discrimination. Both women met in Birmingham as students when they moved to Pakistan from the UK. They later started living together as a couple in South Yorkshire, where they spent a year before deciding to wed. A relative said: 'The couple did not have an Islamic marriage ceremony, known as a nikah, as they could not find an Imam to conduct what would have been a controversial ceremony. 'They have been very brave throughout as our religion does not condone homosexuality. 'The couple have had their lives threatened both here and in Pakistan and there is no way they could ever return there.' Many scholars of Sharia - Islamic - law view homosexuality as a punishable offence. There is no specific punishment prescribed but in extreme cases gay people can be sentenced to death.","Rehana Kausar and Sobia Kamar married at Leeds Register Office .

"Angelina Jolie has been made a dame by William Hague. The starstruck Foreign Secretary, who has spent most of the week at the Hollywood actress’s side, bestowed the surprise accolade on her as part of the Queen’s birthday honours. The pair have been working closely together at a summit on rape in London – despite the escalating political and military crises in Iraq, Syria and Ukraine. Scroll down for video .

Speech: The actress, a UN Special Envoy, talks to those attending the summit. The honour recognises her 'extraordinary' work to stamp out rape as a weapon in war zones . Miss Jolie, the 39-year-old star of Tomb Raider, said: ‘It means a great deal to me.’ But eyebrows were raised at the headline-grabbing damehood, which seals two years of growing friendship between the A-list actress and Mr Hague. As an American citizen, it is highly unusual that Miss Jolie has received an honour from Britain. Foreigners are occasionally awarded them – there was an honorary knighthood for Bob Geldof, who is Irish, after Live Aid. Labour MP Paul Flynn said that giving a top award to a celebrity with friends in high places rather than an unsung British hero undermined the credibility of the honours system. ‘The honours system is becoming increasingly discredited and this is another step in that direction,’ he said. ‘Angelina Jolie is doing creditable work but it is ridiculous to honour people who are already over-endowed with privileges and wealth.’ Critics also said damehoods are usually bestowed later in life, after a recipient has earned a lower honour such as an OBE or a CBE. Arrival: Miss Jolie and partner Brad Pitt arrive at the summit. The actress said the honour meant 'a great deal' Power couple: Miss Jolie and Brad Pitt. Eyebrows were raised at the headline-grabbing damehood last night - which seals two years of growing friendship between the A-list actress and Mr Hague . The honour to Miss Jolie, a UN Special Envoy, recognises her ‘extraordinary’ work to stamp out rape as a weapon in war zones, culminating in a landmark international summit in London to tackle the menace. Mr Hague said she thoroughly deserved the award because she had ‘made a real difference and achieved lasting results’, referring to the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative the pair launched in 2012. Miss Jolie said: ‘To receive an honour related to foreign policy means a great deal to me, as it is what I wish to dedicate my working life to.’ She becomes an honorary Dame Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George. It is awarded to those who ‘render extraordinary or important non-military service in a foreign country’. It can also be conferred for important or loyal service in relation to foreign and Commonwealth affairs. Mr Hague and Miss Jolie have made a number of visits to war zones around the world together.

It is highly unusual for an American citizen to receive an honour from Britain . Coverage: How the Mail covered the summit - which took place despite escalating crises in Iraq and Syria . The Foreign Secretary has seemed bewitched by the actress all week, with he and David Cameron looking like awestruck schoolboys when they welcomed her to Britain on Tuesday. Mr Hague gushed that she was ‘a pleasure to work with’, and said her ‘power to speak to the whole world’ and his ‘levers of decision-making and action’ were a formidable combination. Whitehall officials confirmed Miss Jolie’s damehood was an honour ‘from the Foreign Office ... for services to UK foreign policy and the campaign to end war zone sexual violence’. The Foreign Office refused to confirm it was Mr Hague who had nominated Miss Jolie.

Yesterday Mr Hague was all smiles as he appeared at the closing session of the summit with Miss Jolie, who wore a grey kimono-style dress. Her partner Brad Pitt and Mr Hague’s wife Ffion, who usually shuns publicity, were also present. Later he said he and US Secretary of State John Kerry, who also attended the summit, had ‘obviously’ discussed the deepening conflict in Iraq. Downing Street defended Mr Hague’s decision to devote a week to accompanying Miss Jolie. Mr Cameron believed it was the ‘right thing to do’ to carry on with the ‘very important initiative’, said a spokesman, who insisted Mr Hague had not taken his eye off the ball on Iraq. In 1995, Angelina married Hackers . co-star Jonny Lee Miller. She wore black leather pants and a white top . with Jonny's name reportedly scribbled in her own blood to the ceremony. During the split from Miller, she had her first openly gay relationship. She . began dating her 'Foxfire' co-star Jenny Shimizu, in 1998. The following year, Jolie married . Academy Award-winning actor Billy Bob Thornton. In 2001, Angelina Jolie . and Billy Bob Thornton reportedly signed their wills in blood. Throughout their relationship, they wore vials of each other's blood on a matching necklace. That same year, Angelina caused a . stir when she and her producer brother James Haven shared a passionate . kiss at the Oscars after she won the award for Girl, Interrupted. She has fourteen known tattoos, . including one with the Latin proverb 'quod me nutrit me destruit' - which means 'what . nourishes me destroys me'.

I'm not frightened by anyone's perception of me.' On depression: 'Therapy? I don't need that. The roles that I choose are my therapy.' On death: 'Because I am a bad girl, people automatically think that I am a . bad girl. Or that I carry a dark secret with me or I'm obsessed . with death. The truth is that I am probably the least morbid person one . can meet. If I think more about death than some other people, it is . probably because I love life more than they do.' On settling down: 'I never felt settled or calm. You can't really commit to life when you feel that.' On her sexuality: 'Honestly, I like everything, boyish girls, girlish boys, the heavy and the skinny.' On adoption: 'I'm drawn to kids that are already . born. I think some people are meant to do certain things and I believe . I'm meant to find my children in the world somewhere and not necessarily . have them genetically.' On the blood virals necklaces: 'It was never a vial anyway. It . was like a flower press. It was like from a slight cut on your finger . and you press your fingerprint in.

"Tragic: Cory Monteith died from a lethal combination of heroin and alcohol, it has been revealed . Cory Monteith died from a lethal combination of heroin and alcohol, it has been revealed. The Glee actor, who was found dead in his hotel room on Saturday at the age of 31, died from a 'mixed drug toxicity, involving heroin and alcohol,'  according to authorities. The British Columbia Coroners Service revealed the autopsy results on Tuesday, adding that the investigation into . his death is continuing, and that no further details were available at . this time.

Police Constable Brian Montague said, 'There was evidence in the room that was consistent of a drug overdose,' said Constable Brian Montague, adding that he wouldn't 'go into specifics'. The cause of death has come as a shock to some after it was initially reported that police did not believe drugs to have been involved, but Montague explained they need to err on the side of caution. 'It was the opinion of the investigators that it was a drug overdose, but we didn’t want to speculate,' he said. 'The last thing we would want to do is speculate a drug overdose and then have that not be the case.'

'Mr. Monteith was alone [in his hotel room] when he died,' a Vancouver Police Department spokesperson said. 'He took the heroin when he was alone by himself.' Monteith was found dead in his hotel room at the Fairmont Pacific Rim Hotel in Vancouver on Saturday around noon. It is still unclear what happened to Monteith in the hours leading up to his death. He and his manager dined on Thursday night with Maureen Webb, the co-founder of Project Limelight Society, who said the actor 'looked so good, so healthy'. According to authorities, Monteith and three unidentified people left his hotel room on Friday night and that the actor returned alone at around 2:15 a.m. Hotel staff found his body shortly after noon when Monteith didn't check out.

Drugs and alcohol were reportedly 'always involved.' Monteith's family is said to have been aware that he reverted back to his hard-partying ways in the North American city, but they were unable to help.

A spokesperson said: 'The Glee Project will not be returning to Oxygen, but we are extremely proud of this series which launched the careers of several talented individuals.' Sources insist the cancellation was unrelated to Cory Monteith's death, adding that the decision was made 'several weeks ago.' The show had discovered quite a few singers who guest-starred on Fox's award-winning sitcom, including Damian McGinty, Samuel Larsen, Blake Jenner and Alex Newell. But another website claims Monteith attended a number of Alcoholic Anonymous meetings shortly before he died. A source close to the actor told gossip website RadarOnline.com: 'Cory went to AA meetings when he got to Vancouver with some friends of his and mine. They have attended AA meetings in the past together. 'Vancouver is a great place to keep grounded when you are in the spotlight and trying to be sober.' 'Being grounded is the key to sobriety and that's what Vancouver can offer Cory. It is casual and he calls it home and he has friends here who have known him for a long time.' The insider also insisted that despite being spotted out with friends at the Portside bar in the hours before his death, Cory was not drinking.

"The NHS has agreed to review controversial guidelines that instruct nurses to ask the elderly whether they would agree to a ‘do not resuscitate’ order. The Mail revealed yesterday how patients are being visited at home by nurses they have never met before, and asked sensitive questions. These include where they want to die, and if they want doctors to try to resuscitate them should their hearts stop. Following criticism of the initiative, the NHS’s Chief Nursing Officer for England, Jane Cummings, said yesterday: ‘We will review the [questions] again, with patients and clinical staff, in the light of the poor experiences described in the media, and make any changes that are needed.’ Nurses have been told to ask elderly patients whether they would like a 'Do Not Resuscitate' order (file photo) She added that the revised guidelines will make sure certain questions are only asked as ‘part of an ongoing discussion’ once a ‘meaningful relationship’ has been established between a nurse and patient. This could mean that nurses will only be allowed to discuss the do not resuscitate (DNR) orders if patients bring the topic up first. DNR is an alert put on patients’ medical notes telling doctors not to attempt cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), should their hearts stop beating. The procedure can lead to broken ribs and organ damage, and doctors estimate that it is only successful in 10 to 15 per cent of cases. However, some patients are left to die in hospital because DNR has been put on their notes by mistake. The new guidelines on home interviews were introduced by NHS England in June as part of a drive to improve care of the elderly at home. District nurses have been sent to visit those aged over 75 and with long-term conditions, armed with a list of questions. A Royal College of Nursing spokesman said: ‘Open conversations are crucial to ensuring that patients can choose how they would like to be cared for at the end of their lives, including whether they would like to be resuscitated should their health decline. ‘Nursing skills and experience can make a sensitive conversation more comfortable for all involved, but the conversation needs to happen at the right time and in the right way. It should happen when it is relevant to the person concerned and when the patient has a trusting and familiar relationship with the nurse. ‘It should not happen at a first meeting simply in order to complete a form.’ Dr Peter Carter, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, pictured,  said questions concerning end of life issues should only be raised once a nurse has built up a strong relationship with an individual patient . District nurses have been sent to the homes of patients aged over 75 and those with long-term conditions armed with a form about their medication and care which includes the controversial questions. Health policy analyst Roy Lilley – who was at his mother’s house when the nurse visited – described the policy as ‘callous’ and called for it to be banned. ‘People will be frightened to death thinking the district nurses know something they don’t and will feel obliged to sign the form so as not to be thought a nuisance,’ he said. Concerns were also raised by Dr Peter Carter, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, who said such sensitive questions should only be asked once nurses have built up a strong relationship with the patient. Jane Cummings, the Chief Nursing Officer for England said yesterday: ‘We will review the form again, with patients and clinical staff, in the light of the poor experiences described in the media and make any changes that are needed. ‘Compassionate care should be at the heart of all conversations and relationships between a nurse and patient. ‘Poor implementation of a document by individuals is no excuse for causing distress to our most vulnerable patients and their families.’ Writing in her blog, on the NHS England website, she acknowledged that there had been ‘disturbing accounts’ of nurses ‘discussing end of life care with elderly patients in a blunt and impersonal way, particularly patients’ wishes concerning resuscitation.’ Referring to the experience of Mr Lilley’s mother, she said: ‘It was not good, upsetting and should not have happened. As a nurse I was very disappointed to hear that story. ‘This is one of the most important questions a person ever faces. However, it needs to be part of an ongoing discussion that develops out of a meaningful relationship between a nurse and patient and their families. ‘The aim is not simply to work through a document and tick it off, but to ensure that every patient’s questions, concerns and options have been addressed.’ Mr Lilley, a respected health commentator and former chair of an NHS trust, was at his mother’s home earlier this week when a district nurse arrived 45 minutes late for a scheduled visit. She began going through the form with his mother and within ten minutes of first meeting her asked where she would like to die and if she had agreed to a DNR or Do Not Resuscitate order. This is an alert put on patients’ medical notes telling doctors not to attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should their hearts suddenly stop beating. CPR is very traumatic and can lead to broken ribs and damage to organs such as the spleen and doctors . Doctors estimate that only between 10 to 15 per cent of patients are brought back to life following CPR. Nonetheless there have been tragic cases of patients being allowed to die in hospital because DNRs have been mistakenly put on their medical notes.","District nurses were told to ask elderly patients about end of life plan .

"Helen Smith, 42, couldn't believe her luck when a dress she made from 24,000 loom bands reached the high bid of £170,000 after she posted it on eBay. And it seems that many more wannabe weavers are eager to follow suit and make a quick buck from their rubber band creations, with the online auction site being inundated with clothing and accessories made from the bright bands. Fashion fans have crafted everything from bikinis to belts and even high-heeled shoes from the rainbow-coloured elastic bands. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Going loomy: Lots of loom band enthusiasts are listing their fashion creations on online auction site eBay . Yesterday saw the first ever man's 'loomkini' go up for sale on the site on sale at £30. The listing of 'thong made from the popular bands' was originally taken down as the image broke eBay's nudity laws but the product has since reappeared on the site using a different image to illustrate the design. Sam Innes, 22, from Musselburgh outside Edinburgh, created the swimwear and has currently received six bids with the loomkini currently going for £51, which seems rather modest compared to Helen's huge profit. The . auction for the loomkini closes on Friday at 3.24pm. Even flip-flops and high heels created from the colourful bands are beginning to appear on eBay . The shoes aren't created entirely out of the bands but instead heels are decorated using the weave . Jumping on the band wagon: Helen Smith, 42, put her dress, made entirely from loom bands by her friend Katherine, on eBay and it reached £170,000 - since then the auction site has been inundated with loom band creations . If the bikini sells for that price it would yield a £45 profit (not factoring in the 24 . hours labour it took to create). For some of the weavers their creations are more than just a hobby. One listing advertises a bodycon boob-tube style dress that is being sold to raise funds for a big day. The dress was designed by Dani Hubbard 26, from Porth in Rhonnda, who enlisted her family to help make the dress which took them a grand total of 39 hours to create. Too much skin: Innes's original advertisement showed more of his figure than eBay allows (right) but his item has since been relisted and the 22-year-old is currently fetching bids over £50 . Dani is hoping that her efforts will pay for her wedding to partner Jamie. According to The Mirror newspaper Dani is even hoping there will be enough to set aside a little extra to help buy her brother a car to thank him for helping with the dress. 'It was my brother's idea to make such a fashionable dress, and he helped me decide on the particular style we ended up with after we had discussed it. I haven't seen anything on the internet like it.' Dani Hubbard is hoping that her complicated design might fetch enough to cover the cost of her wedding...not to mention a car for her brother . Pick of the crop: This revealing crop top is one of the many inventive designs currently listed on the site . 'I just thought that if the other lady could do it, then so can I. There's a huge craze going on at the moment with these bands, so I gave it a go' continued the hopeful bride-to-be. However it appears that the increasing availability of loom band clothing is seeing the value of the garments decrease. 11-year-old Abigail Baker from Desborough, Northamptonshire, spent seven days crafting a loom band dress from 25,000 of the elastic bands. A family affair: Abigail will spend her £45 profit on a fish and chip dinner with her folks on their next holiday . Abigail used £90 worth of the bands and saw her dress go under the hammer for just £155. However the school girl seemed unscathed and thanked her family for the support. 'My family have . been the greatest throughout because they gave me the £90 to make this . dress and have supported me all the way.' Unlike Dani, Abigail has much more humble plans for her loom band profit. She said she wanted to raise at least . £50 cash so she could give her four-year-old brother Liam £10, keep £20 . for her to spend in the arcades and £20 for a fish and chip dinner . treat while on holiday in Weymouth, Dorset, next month.

"Workers should stand at their desks for at least an hour a day to prevent obesity and heart disease, according to a top public health expert. Professor Kevin Fenton warned that spending six or seven hours a day sat down in the office was having a detrimental effect on their health. Instead he said they should break up the time by holding stand-up meetings, coffees or lunches or set aside a certain amount of time to work standing up. He said being active is the ‘miracle cure we’ve been waiting for’ to reduce the risk of cancer, heart disease and improving mental health. Standing at your desk for at least half an hour a day helps prevent obesity and heart disease. Stock image used . Professor Fenton, the national director for Health and Wellbeing at Public Health England, the body in charge of improving our health, also urged workers to donate money to charity every time they took the lift rather than the stairs. NHS figures show that more than 40 per cent of women and a third of men do not complete the recommended 30 minutes of exercise five times a week. This includes a quarter of women and a third of men who are classed as inactive, meaning they do less than 30 minutes exercise on a weekly basis. Harvard academics have claimed that sitting down for too long is as bad for our health as tobacco because it is directly responsible for more deaths worldwide. Professor Fenton, said: ‘Globally we’ve become more and more inactive, in part because our jobs are making us more sedentary. ‘We spend too much time sitting down at our computers. ‘I don’t think people understand that physical activity is the miracle cure we’ve been waiting for. ‘This is in terms of helping us manage our weight, reducing our risk of cancers, reducing our risk of heart disease and increasing our mental health and wellbeing. ‘Sitting is a problem. Some authors say sitting is the new tobacco, I wouldn’t go that far as it isn’t addictive. In October, Public Health England will release new guidelines on exercise . ‘But we’re too immobile. ‘Standing has benefits for improving your posture and therefore back pain, it improves your circulation and therefore cardiovascular health and it also promotes greater mobility in general. ‘If you are standing you are likely to be moving around a little bit more. ‘There’s no minimum time for standing but it’s about being mindful about not sitting down for six or seven hours a day.’ Standing-up increases the heart rate by about ten beats a minute, which in turn burns an extra 0.7 calories a minute, or 50 an hour. Professor Fenton said that by standing at their desks, office workers would be inclined to move about more and take the stairs rather than lift. Going up a typical flight of stairs burns two or three extra calories, which soon adds up if done many times a day. In October, Public Health England will issue new guidelines on exercise which will encourage adults to become more active by making small changes to their lifestyle. This will include taking short walks with the family, getting off the bus a stop earlier and going jogging with friends or colleagues. Around 1 in 4 adults are now considered obese and the rate has increased four fold in the last 25 years. But some academics say this is mainly down to us becoming more inactive rather than us eating more calories. Professor Fenton, who formerly advised the US Government on public health, said: ‘I would recommend that people start standing an hour a day, half an hour in the morning, half an hour in the afternoon and then build that up gradually. Standing lunches, standing coffees. In 2012 a study by Harvard researchers published in the Lancet medical journal claimed that sitting down had caused more deaths globally than tobacco. They calculated that 5.3 million deaths from heart disease, cancer and diabetes, would be avoided each year if all inactive people exercised, slightly more than  the 5 million deaths annually from smoking. Amy Thompson, Senior Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘Your heart is the most important muscle in your body. ‘It doesn’t matter how you get your heart pumping, whether it’s taking regular walks or skipping the lift for the stairs, it can all make a big difference to your health.’","Workers should stand at their desks for at least an hour a day, says expert .

"A British baby has been taken into emergency care in Portugal as police probe claims her parents were ‘drunk and disorderly’. The pair allegedly threw their 14-month-old girl into a hotel swimming pool in front of horrified holidaymakers at their Algarve resort. The mother was also seen staggering around with the little girl in her arms on the eighth-floor balcony of their hotel room, it was claimed. The couple were staying at four-star Hotel Paraiso (pictured) in Albuferia when staff called police after they allegedly threw their 14-month-old baby daughter in the swimming pool . Police were called by concerned hotel staff, and they discovered unexplained bruises on the child’s body, according to local reports. Yesterday prosecutors were questioning the couple while their baby was being cared for at a children’s hospital in the regional capital Faro. The latest drama unfolded on Sunday evening at the four-star Hotel Paraíso, which describes itself as ‘one of the most charismatic and well-known hotels on the Algarve’. A police spokesman said: ‘We were called to a tourist resort where a foreign couple were drunk with a baby child and causing a disturbance.’ Last night a hotel worker claimed: ‘The couple were drunk and the child was thrown into the pool and was in danger. She was taken to hospital.’ Newspaper Jornal de Notícias claimed the mother was drunk with her baby on the balcony of the family’s eighth-floor room. A witness told the paper: ‘It was a tremendous fright, seeing the mum bumping into the walls with the baby in her arms, falling to the ground, getting up and falling again. ‘I thought the little girl would fall over the balcony.’ The girl was taken into the care of social services in the regional capital of Faro, while her parents were questioned by police in Albuferia . Portuguese newspaper Diario de Noticias claimed: ‘The couple threw the baby into the pool, causing enormous concern to hotel guests having dinner nearby.’ When police were called, the father allegedly ‘tried to fight’ with officers, according to local reports. The couple were not arrested, but face two separate investigations, one by the Albufeira Judicial Court into the alleged behaviour of the father, and the other by the Family Court in Portimão to determine the welfare of the baby. A hospital spokesman said later that the little girl was fine, with ‘no health problems’. Yesterday, after being interviewed at Albufeira Court, her parents were allowed to visit their daughter in the hospital.

"'Security breach': BBC's political editor Nick Robinson lost his phone while watching football in Manchester . As the BBC’s political editor, he has the phone numbers of senior politicians at his fingertips. Well, most of the time... During an unfortunate incident as he attended a football match, Nick Robinson lost his mobile phone containing personal contacts for everyone from the Prime Minister down. Mobile numbers for ‘most of the Cabinet’, Downing Street officials and key civil servants were stored on the phone, sources said. Now the loss of the treasure trove of government contacts is being treated as a ‘serious security breach’ by No.10. It is also being investigated by the data watchdog the Information Commissioner, it is understood. Robinson, 50, is a lifelong Manchester United fan and was off-duty to watch a football match at Old Trafford when his phone disappeared. It is unclear if it was mislaid or stolen. But fears it could end up in the wrong hands sparked a security scare after the journalist reported it was missing. Last night Robinson confirmed the loss, but played it down, telling the Mail: ‘It was weeks ago and it’s all over.’ A BBC spokesman added: ‘When Nick Robinson lost his mobile phone some weeks ago he informed some of his contacts out of courtesy. The BBC takes its data protection duties seriously and as a precaution the Information Commissioner was also informed. ‘There is no evidence that any of the data on the phone has been accessed or compromised. The Information Commissioner has since told us that he believes the BBC took the appropriate action.’ Robinson is accustomed to keeping his mobile phone with him wherever he goes, often taking and making calls moments before going live in Downing Street to confirm a breaking political news story. But this is not the first time he has been embarrassed by one of his mobile devices. Earlier this year during a heated TV debate reviewing Prime Minister’s Questions, the discussion was interrupted by the soundtrack of Fat Bottomed Girls, by rock band Queen, suddenly coming from Robinson’s tablet computer. Investigation: Nick Robinson, seen here with with Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls had  personal contacts for David Cameron, 'most of the Cabinet', Downing Street officials and key civil servants on his phone . And in January, he revealed how his wife Pippa had lost her phone too, when he tweeted: ‘Three cheers for the cabbie who found my wife’s mobile in his cab, charged it up and brought it back! Restores your faith...’ Born in Macclesfield, Robinson became a committed Manchester United supporter as a paper boy when he discovered former United star Stan Pearson was on his round. And last year he caused a stir by declaring the club’s outgoing manager Sir Alex Ferguson as the ‘greatest living Briton’. He made the remark on Radio 4’s Today programme whilst ‘slightly distracted’ from his analysis of the Queen’s Speech by speculation around Sir Alex’s retirement. Hard-hitting Robinson, who is married with three children and lives in North London, is one of the nation’s most trusted broadcasters. The BBC’s political editor since 2005, he has made the role his own and boasts more viewers and listeners than any of his rivals in the Westminster lobby. He rises early to broadcast on the Today programme and is still going by the time of the BBC News at 10pm. He also files regular updates from Westminster on his blog, via Twitter and the BBC’s 24-hour news channel. Last night a Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘There is no comment because it is a security issue.’ The Information Commissioner also declined to comment.","BBC's political editor lost his phone - and a brimming contacts book .

"Sir David Nicholson has confessed to eight-pint beer binges while running the NHS. The bureaucrat, who was branded ‘the man with no shame’ for presiding over the Mid Staffs hospital scandal, said: ‘I lost control of my health. And I was head of the NHS.’ Despite the appalling neglect at Mid Staffs, which cost up to 1,200 lives, Sir David was allowed to retire in March on a vast pension. Sir David Nicholson admits to eight-pint drinking sessions while he was in charge of the NHS. He retired in March but was criticised for the Mid Staffs scandal . In a newspaper article, Sir David, 58, . said: ‘I was brought up from the age of 14 to think that on Friday . night, it’s eight pints of bitter, and did that through my 40s and into . my 50s. Every Friday night I’d go out and have seven or eight pints.’ NHS . guidelines state that men should not drink more than 21 units of . alcohol a week – the amount its chief executive was drinking in a single . evening. A pint of bitter typically contains two to three units of . alcohol. The NHS Choices . website says: ‘Researchers define binge drinking as consuming eight or . more units in a single session for men. You can easily lose control of . what you do or say and may make risky decisions, thinking you’re . invulnerable.’ Julie Bailey of Cure the NHS said she was not surprised by the confession. Her elderly mother died in dreadful circumstances in the care of Mid Staffordshire NHS trust . In Sir . David’s Guardian article, he describes how he has given up beer, chips . and unhealthy sauces after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes on . Christmas Eve 2012. He said . he was spurred into taking action by the thought that he wanted to live . ‘for as long as I can’ to see his 18-month-old daughter Rosa growing up. She . was born, when Sir David was 57, to his second wife Sarah-Jane Marsh, . who is 20 years his junior and the chief executive of Birmingham . Children’s Hospital. He has two 20-something sons, Liam and Paul, from . his first marriage. He took over as NHS chief executive in 2006 when he was 50. Sir . David’s revelation about his alcohol consumption will anger relatives . of the victims of the Mid Staffs scandal who believe he failed to get a . grip on the crisis. Last . night campaigner Julie Bailey, of Cure the NHS, whose elderly mother . died in dreadful circumstances in the care of Mid Staffordshire NHS . trust, said she was not surprised by the confession. ‘Nothing shocks me . about that man, but it explains a lot,’ she said. ‘He . was going to the pub and having eight pints while supposedly being in . charge of the NHS. It’s another example of NHS bosses telling us how to . live our lives but doing the opposite in private.’ She . added she was angry at another claim in the article, where Sir David . states: ‘When I was the NHS chief executive people used to say that I . famously had “grip”, that I knew what was going on and was in charge.’ The Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust was blasted over the poor level of care patients received and the extraordinarily high number of patient deaths . Miss . Bailey said: ‘That’s completely at odds with what he told the health . select committee, which was that he could not possibly know, and did not . know, what was going on everywhere in the NHS.’ Sir David maintained he was ‘obsessed’ by his work, but admitted his health suffered. He . wrote: ‘I had lost control of my health and my lifestyle. I had . abdicated responsibility for my own health and allowed it to get out of . control, even though I was chief executive of the NHS. The irony of that . was huge.’ He said he also . realised he had to tackle his weight, writing: ‘I didn’t think about . the implications until I began growing out of all my clothes. ‘Thank . heaven for Marks and Spencer’s elasticated waist trousers. I bought . them with a 38 or 40-inch waist, but they expanded, so I could kid . myself that my weight wasn’t as gross as it was. ‘When . I saw the GP that Christmas Eve I weighed 111 kilogrammes – 17 stone . and six pounds. Looking back, I had been in denial. I’d never, ever . weighed myself.’ He said he had made radical changes to his lifestyle as part of efforts to manage his diabetes. Sir . David said his days of downing eight pints were over:  ‘I’ve now cut . out beer altogether. So I’ve undergone a dramatic revolution in my . lifestyle. I’ve lost about three stone and am doing my best to keep my . weight down.’","Sir David Nicholson drank the weekly drink guidelines for men in a night .

"The woman who exposed sexist emails by football chief Richard Scudamore said yesterday she blew the whistle because she felt ‘humiliated, belittled and disgusted’. Rani Abraham, Scuadmore’s former PA, said she felt a duty to reveal his crude messages about women. In public, Scudamore, the £2.5million-a-year chief executive of the Premier League, likes to be seen as a champion of equality. Scroll down for video . Sexist: Premier League boss Richard Scuadmore's former personal assistant Rani Abraham, 41, said she felt a duty to reveal his crude messages about women . But he may face action as a backlash grows to sleazy emails he wrote mocking ‘female irrationality’. A crunch meeting of football chiefs is to be held Monday and Tuesday, another meeting will be chaired by Football Association director Heather Rabbatts – the most powerful woman in English football - who has already called for Scudamore to consider his position in light of ‘growing evidence of a closed culture of sexism’ at the Premier League. Scudamore has already apologised for his emails, sent to senior male colleagues, in which there were jokes about ‘big t****d broads’, ‘irrational’ women and one in which he dubbed a former girlfriend a ‘double decker’ – because she was ‘happy for you to play upstairs but her Dad got angry if you went below’. Miss Abraham, 41, said she had read the emails because they were automatically forwarded to her as part of her job as Scudamore’s PA. She first revealed them in the Sunday Mirror a week ago. Yesterday she explained to the same paper she had done it because she was shocked by the emails. She . said: ‘I found it disgusting, vulgar and very disrespectful. I felt I . didn’t want to see Richard if that was how he felt about women. Sexist: Premier League boss Richard Scuadmore has apologised, but may face action as a backlash grows to sleazy emails he wrote mocking 'female irrationality' ‘I was brought up in a family where women were treated with respect.’ She added: ‘Scudamore started talking about China’s one-child policy being a way to stop women becoming more irrational after having children. ‘I thought, he’s had five children. He’s talking about his wife. How does his wife feel? His wife has been humiliated, so have his daughters.’ She said: ‘For those people who’ve attacked me for saying they were just “jokes”, I wonder how they would feel if their wife or girlfriend or daughter had to read messages like that. ‘And how would they feel if those messages were written about their wife or girlfriend or daughter?’ She said she felt the Premier League, ‘with all its money and influence’, was trying to ‘turn the fire on me to deflect from what he’s done’. Scudamore – described as the most powerful man in English football - has been boss of the Premier League since 1999. The . row has thrown a spotlight on his claims that it strives to be ‘at the . leading edge’ of the ‘whole equality agenda’. He has pledged £2.4million . to invest in women’s football. But . Casey Stoney, England women’s captain, said: ‘We are trying to get to a . world without discrimination and to have somebody in such a high . position in football making derogatory comments about females is not . acceptable.’ Sorry: The £2.5million-a-year chief executive of the Premier League has apologized for the emails, which were sent to senior male colleagues joking about 'big t****d broads' And Anna Kessel, chair of Women in . Football, said: ‘Women are shocked and dismayed both by the content of . those emails and by the reaction of the football authorities in dealing . with this matter.’ Dame Tessa Jowell, former Olympics minister, has said his remarks ‘undermine’ his championing of women’s football. Critique: England women¿s captain Casey Stoney said the comments made by Scudamore were unacceptable . Several other England women internationals have expressed outrage too, while FA chairman Greg Dyke called them ‘totally inappropriate’. Sponsor Barclays has also expressed its ‘disappointment’ to the Premier League - raising the stakes ahead of Monday’s meeting of the League’s audit and remuneration committee, which has the power to reprimand Scudamore. The football boss, who lives with his wife Catherine in a £1.8million home in Cirencester, has apologised for his ‘inappropriate’ emails but said the messages were ‘private email exchanges between colleagues and friends’. Yesterday the Premier League said in a statement: ‘We do not recognise this characterisation of the working environment at the Premier League, nor do we believe that it can be supported by the facts. ‘The chief executive has already apologised for any offence caused and a proper review of all the evidence is now under way within the Premier League’s established and rigorous procedures. ‘This process is not yet concluded and it is therefore not possible to offer comments in detail at this stage. 'However we will make a further statement in due course ‘The Premier League continues to be fully committed to treating all staff fairly and on merit, regardless of gender.’","Richard Scudamore's PA says she felt 'humiliated' by sexist emails .

"He has convinced devotees from Hollywood stars to U.S. presidents that yoga should be performed in very hot temperatures by very sweaty students. But Sarah Baughn has claimed she knows from bitter experience that multi-millionaire guru Bikram Choudhury can become fired up in a very different way. The pretty 24-year-old alleges he pursued her for years and had implored fellow attendees at one of his training camps in 2008 not to leave her alone with him. Fired up: Sarah Baughn, right, has accused the millionaire founder of 'hot' yoga Bikram Choudhury of sexual offences and is suing him . But one night when, as usual, they all had to stay up with Choudhury and watch his favourite Bollywood films, she nodded off. She says she awoke to find her friends disappearing out of the door. 'I grabbed my shoes and the door went click. I remember the click,' she says. 'I ran to the door. When I got to the door, he was on me. He was all over me.' She is one of four former students suing Choudhury, accusing him of sexual offences - rape in the case of three of the women. They claim the internationally renowned founder of Bikram, or 'hot', yoga took advantage of the 'cult-like' atmosphere in which they say he holds sway over his acolytes. Bikram denies the allegations and has described the charges as 'false'. As yet, no court date has been set when he will defend his name. The women claim most of the alleged abuse took place at one of Choudhury's twice-yearly teacher-training retreats, which are compulsory for anyone who wants to teach Bikram yoga. 'Cult-like' atmosphere: Devotees pay nearly £8,000 for a nine-week boot camp with Choudhury, who has compared himself to Jesus, Buddha and Superman . Devotees pay nearly £8,000 for a nine-week boot camp, staying at a California hotel and undergoing a regimen so gruelling that some people vomit, break down in tears or pass out. On top of that, they have to listen to rambling monologues from the man who, at 67, conducts classes wearing tight black Speedo swimming trunks and a jewel-encrusted Rolex watch. Bikram yoga consists of a series of 26 postures and two breathing exercises performed in a precise sequence for 90 minutes in a room heated to 105f. Choudhury, who says he saw the benefit of intense heat while teaching in his native Calcutta, maintains his yoga can even cure cancer and Parkinson's disease. The yogi, who claims to have been invited to the U.S. in 1973 by President Richard Nixon to help him improve his health, says he has even taught Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Star fans of his form of yoga include Gwyneth Paltrow, George Clooney, Benedict Cumberbatch, Andy Murray, David Beckham and Lady Gaga. His global empire (more than 600 yoga schools in 220 countries) has made Choudhury a multi-millionaire, and a very flamboyant one at that. Misogynistic: Choudhury's former legal adviser claims the guru routinely referred to women as 'bitches' No loin cloth and bed of nails for him. He lives in a gaudy, 8,000 sq ft Beverly Hills mansion and owns dozens of Rolls-Royces and Bentleys. The diminutive yogi's sartorial taste is pure Bollywood:  tailor-made white leather  suits, industrial quantities of bling and an obligatory entourage of stunning girls in  skin-tight clothes. Witnesses say he only needs to enter a room and his acolytes will bow down and put their hands together in prayer. Miss Baughn started Bikram yoga in 2004 and, according to her lawsuit, was initially flattered by Choudhury's attentions (he told her they knew each other in a past life). He pursued her for years, eventually sabotaging her yoga career by discouraging studios from hiring her after she rejected him, she claims. On the night of their final encounter after the film screening, he pinned her against the door and groped her, she says. She escaped, but others, it is claimed, were not so fortunate. Larissa Anderson, from Washington state, started Bikram yoga when she was 22 and became close to Choudhury because her boyfriend was one of his chief disciples. In her own lawsuit, she claims that one night after dinner, when Choudhury's wife and business partner Rajashree had gone to bed, he tried to kiss her. She rebuffed him but claims he raped her, causing her to go into 'trauma shock' and simply freeze, unable to cry for help. She says she was terrified that her 'life would be over' if she left Choudhury's close-knit community, so she remained but tried to keep her distance from him. In 2011, she finally left the community after claiming he assaulted her again, this time trapping her against a wall as he pressed his body into hers. He got his revenge for her departure, she says, by refusing to recognise her studio as part of the Bikram movement. Two other women, identified in court papers simply as Jane Doe 1 and 2, have made similar accusations against Choudhury. Jane Doe 1 alleges that, during teacher-training in 2011, he told her he had a 'gift' for her because they 'thought the same' and she had been 'touched by God'. One morning, when she was performing her assigned task of cleaning his hotel suite, he surprised her and forced her on to the bed, she claims. As she told him to stop, he repeatedly called her 'idiot'. She then makes an allegation that Bikram forced her to perform oral sex and raped her. The woman said she had invested everything, financially and mentally, in becoming a Bikram teacher and couldn't afford to leave his community. Pure Bollywood: The yogi, pictured with his wife Rajashree, left, enjoys tailor-made white leather suits and industrial quantities of bling . She says he attacked her again in his room days later and 'remembers feeling that his sexual assaults were incestuous'. She eventually left with money lent by her mother and reported him to police three weeks after Miss Baughn filed her lawsuit. Jane Doe 2 was 21 when her boyfriend paid for her to attend a training retreat in 2010. When Choudhury started making sexual innuendos, she says she was offended but didn't want to waste her boyfriend's hard-earned money by dropping out. She claims she rebuffed Choudhury's repeated attempts to seduce her until one night, as trainees sat through one of the mandatory Bollywood film screenings (anyone who fell asleep was shaken awake by staff), he asked her to come up to his room to discuss her career. 'Don't worry, we won't be alone,' he allegedly told her. Accuser: 24-year-old Sarah Baughn was once an acolyte of Choudhury's but is now taking action against him . Too late, she discovered he was lying and started to walk out. He implored her to stay, saying he needed to 'spiritually enlighten' her, but to do that, they needed 'to become one', she says. The woman alleges he then raped her, even as she pleaded with him to stop. She says she considered going to police immediately, but her room-mate persuaded her to stay in training. The day after the attack, she says Choudhury regaled his class with a story about how women would rape him when he first moved to the U.S. She ran out of the tent in tears. Additional lawsuit: Larissa Anderson says the yogi raped her . She says Choudhury later insisted she sit next to him and his wife at her graduation dinner, taking her aside afterwards and warning her in no uncertain terms against crossing him. Inevitably, questions have been asked as to why these women stayed in the community. 'What did you think would happen in his hotel room? You think he was going to help you with your standing-bow pose?' asked a Bikram teacher who suggested the women used sex to get what they wanted. But the yogi's woes are piling up. Choudhury is also being sued by his former legal adviser, Minakshi Jaffa-Bodden, who claims he threatened to have her deported after she insisted on investigating  the allegations. She claims Choudhury is homophobic, racist and misogynistic, routinely referring to women as 'bitches'. Neither Choudhury nor any of his official representatives have commented on the latest accusations, though in March he responded to one of the first lawsuits by saying he was 'disappointed by the false charges'. Devotees say he has a superhuman ability to understand their past and see their future, and he has compared himself to Jesus Christ, Buddha and Superman. Whether Bikram's Karma - good or otherwise - will be much use in a court of law, however, remains to be seen.","Bikram Choudhury founded 'hot' yoga, where practitioners assume a series of poses in 105f rooms .
