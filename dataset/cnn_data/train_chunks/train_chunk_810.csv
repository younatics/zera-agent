Shouting, kicking, punching and attempting to choke his wife - all symptoms suffered by a sleeping 70-year-old Australian man with rapid eye movement behaviour disorder. While most of us enjoy sleeping, the man was suffering one of the most bizarre sleep disorders, which was so bad he strapped himself into bed to prevent injuring his wife in a violent outburst. A rare condition, rapid eye movement behaviour disorder takes place in the rapid eye movement stage of sleep and sees abnormal and often violent outbursts of vocal or physical behaviour in response to dreams and mirrors dream content and can affect men and women of all ages. Nightmare: A 70-year-old man suffered an undiagnosed rare sleep disorder, which saw him violently react to terrifying dreams . After about an eight-year history of severe sleep disturbances occurring almost nightly, the elderly man was promoted by his wife to visit a general practitioner about the unusual and dangerous behaviour, the Australian Medical Journal reported on May 5. Following the visit, the man was referred to a specialist sleep service in December 2010. Revealing details about his severe sleep disturbance, the man was experiencing terrifying dreams, in which he feared for his life while being attacked or chased - and he remembered it all vividly. As a result of the dreams, the man would wake in bizarre positions with his clothes thrown around the bedroom. But most worryingly, while he was still sleeping, the man would shout in reaction and suffer dangerously violent motor responses. Rapid eye movement behaviour disorder takes place in the rapid eye movement stage of sleep and sees abnormal and often violent outbursts of vocal or physical behaviour . Unknowingly to him, his wife became a target - kicking, punching and even trying to choke her. Even after falling out of bed, the man smashed himself into bedroom furniture including bedside tables and wardrobes. With the violent nature of his disorder causing physical harm to himself and his wife, as a precaution, mattresses were used on the floor in an attempt to reduce further injury. Eventually, the man tried restraining himself to the bed frame using two belts strapped tightly around his chest and waist to stop him from his violent outbursts. With the behaviour continuing, his wife was forced to sleep in a separate move to prevent herself from being hurt. Despite the suffering the rare disorder, the man did not have a history of snoring or other symptoms suggestive of obstructive sleep apnoea. Nor was he suffering neurological problems or psychiatric illness. The elderly man's actions became so bad because of the disorder that his wife has to sleep in a different room for her own safety . Monitored by video overnight, abnormal motor activity was detected while he was in rapid eye movement sleep, leading to a rapid eye movement  sleep behaviour disorder diagnosis. The diagnosis lead to successful drug treatment and at a two-year follow-up, the Australian Medical Journal reported the man maintained improvements with violent dream enactment behaviour occurring rarely. He also recorded no cases of falling out of bed or injuries, improvement in sleep quality and there is still no sign of neurological symptoms. The Journal reported that between 33 and 65 per cent of patients with the disorder suffer sleep-related injuries to themselves or their bed partner . While men aged over 50 are most affected, both genders of all ages can suffer the disorder. Disruptive: Outbursts caused by the disorder can range multiple times every night to once every few months . Outbursts endured by those with the disorder can range multiple times every night to once every few months. The disorder can be associated with an underlying neuropathological conditions including Parkinson disease. Treatment focuses on reducing the nightmares and associated behaviours and any related injuries. Adelaide Institute for Sleep Health's Dr Richard Weeks explained that during repaid eye movement sleep, which makes up about 25 per cent of sleep time, most people normally lose a lot of muscle tone. This renders them virtually paralysed, News.com.au reported. But for people with the disorder, they maintain their muscle tone, which can even increase because their bodies have not been sent a message from their brain to relax.","A 70-year-old Australian man suffered an undiagnosed rare sleep disorder .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . 53 years ago today, Alan B Shepard Jr. became the first American in space. The momentous occasion was sullied somewhat by the Soviet Union’s Yuri Gagarin becoming the first human in space a few weeks prior, but it was a momentous occasion nonetheless. Shepard’s journey set in motion over five decades of exploration that has seen Nasa land men on the moon, explore the surface of Mars, reach the edge of the solar system and begin preparations for manned missions into deep space. This image shows the view of astronaut Alan B. Shepard, Jr. of Earth that no American had seen before, looking down on our home planet from the Freedom 7 Mercury capsule on his history-making suborbital flight. During the 15-minute flight, Shepard reported seeing the outline of the west coast of Florida . Around noon on 5 May 1961, Shepard was sat inside his Freedom 7 Mercury capsule. He was about to embark on the first manned mission of Project Mercury - Nasa’s ambitious plan to test various aspects of space exploration for the first time. 12 April 1961 – First human in space (Yuri Gagarin) 5 May 1961 – First American in space (Alan Shepard) 16 June 1963 – First woman in space (Valentina Tereshkova) 21 July 1969 – First human on the moon (Neil Armstrong) 7 June 1971 – First manned space station (Soyuz 11/Salyut 1) 12 April 1981 – First manned space plane (Space Shuttle, STS-1) 20 November 1998 – Construction of the International Space Station begins . 15 October 2003 – First Chinese taikonaut in space (Yang Liwei) The programme was also intended to beat the Soviets to a number of ‘firsts’ such as the first human in space and first orbit. Ultimately the Soviet Union would claim early victories, getting the inaugural human into space and completing the first manned orbit. But Project Mercury would prove to be the vital start Nasa needed to ultimately win the so-called space race by landing men on the moon. After several hours waiting on the launchpad the Redstone rocket under Shepard's capsule, known officially as Mercury-Redstone 3, lifted off. In total the flight lasted a little over 15 minutes and, while Shepard didn’t complete an orbit of Earth like his counterpart Gagarin, he did become the first human to actually pilot a spacecraft, as Gagarin’s flight was automated. Although he didn't get a chance to say much during the flight, Shepard is known to have uttered 'what a beautiful view' as he gazed out of the window at Earth. At a maximum speed of 5,134 miles (8,262 kilometres) per hour he reached a total height of 116.5 miles (187.5 kilometres) and travelled 302.8 miles (487.3 kilometres) down range from the launch site at Cape Canaveral, Florida before safely splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. Unlike Gagarin he did not eject from his capsule on his return to Earth, leading some to regard Shepard as the first human to actually complete a spaceflight. Nonetheless the progress since then has been astounding. Nasa has become the foremost space exploration agency in the world, and continues to perform groundbreaking science across the solar system. And they recently announced their plans to take humans to Mars for the first time in the 2030s, which by then will be over 70 years since Shepard's first flight. On the left, Alan Shepard's Freedom 7 capsule is taken into space atop a Redstone rocket on 5 May 1961, the first American human spaceflight. On the right the latest manned spaceflight, Expedition 39, prepares for launch to the multi-billion dollar International Space Station on 26 March 2014 . During the 9 April 1959 news conference that introduced the seven Mercury astronauts they were asked: 'Who wants to be the first man launched into space?' All seven raised their hands. From the left, are Donald Slayton, Alan Shepard, Wally Schirra, Gus Grissom, John Glenn, Gordon Cooper and Scott Carpenter . How far we've come: Shepard's first view of Earth was a fleeting glimpse of the planet that lasted a few minutes. Now modern astronauts and cosmonauts work together on six-month stays aboard an orbiting laboratory, the ISS.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . It is said that there’s no such thing as a free lunch, but even if you manage to bag a bargain meal, it will not taste as good as a more expensive option, according to scientists. A new study has found that restaurant goers who pay more for their meals think the food is tastier than if it is offered for a smaller price. The experts think that people tend to associate cost with quality and this changes their perception of how food tastes. Food tastes better if it's expensive: A new study has found that restaurant goers who pay more for their meals think the food is tastier than it was offered for a smaller price - regardless of if the ingredients are luxurious (pictured) People who paid $8 instead of $4 for a buffet enjoyed their meal 11 per cent more than those who ate the cheaper food. Those that paid for the $4 (£2.40) buffet said felt guiltier about loading up their plates and felt that they over ate. However, the scientists said that both groups ate around the same quantity of food in total. In another experiment, scientists found that people who eat in dim lighting consume 175 less calories than people who eat in brightly lit areas. Scientists at Cornell University in New York studied the eating habits of 139 people enjoying an Italian buffet in an upstate restaurant. The price of the food was set by the researchers at either $4 (£2.40) or $8 (£4.70) for the all-you-can-eat meal. Customers were asked to rate how good the food tasted, the quality of the restaurant and to leave their names. The experiment revealed that the people who paid $8 (£4.70) for the food enjoyed their meal 11 per cent more than those who ate the ‘cheaper’ buffet. Interestingly those that paid for the $4 (£2.40) buffet said they felt guiltier about loading up their plates and felt that they over ate. However, the scientists said that both groups ate around the same quantity of food in total, according to the study presented at the Experimental Biology 2014 meeting this week. Dig in: Scientists at Cornell University in New York studied the eating habits of 139 people eating an Italian buffet in an upstate restaurant (stock image) and found that people who paid $8 instead of $4 for a buffet enjoyed their meal 11 per cent more than those who ate the cheaper food . Brian Wansink, a professor of consumer behaviour at the university, said: ‘We were fascinated to find that pricing has little impact on how much one eats, but a huge impact on how you interpret the experience.’ He thinks that people enjoyed their food more as they associated cost with quality and that small alterations to a restaurant can change how tasty people find their meals. In a previous study, researchers from the university showed that people who eat in dim lighting consume 175 less calories than people who eat in brightly lit areas.","Scientists at Cornell University in New .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . The days of missing your junction because you were in the wrong lane might be over. The latest update to the Google Maps app, now available for Android and iOS, has been significantly improved. And apart from telling you which lane to be in, it has some other nifty new features that will keep you better connected than ever before. Google has rolled out an update on Android and iOS for its Maps app. Amongst other new features, now when navigating a route the app will tell you what lane to be in, ensuring you don't miss your exit or turning . The first new feature unveiled by Google is the ‘changing lanes’ function. Google says its driverless cars are mastering California's city streets and could be available by 2017. They have a fleet of Lexus SUVs retrofitted with lasers, radar and cameras. The fleet has driven 700,000 accident-free miles (1.1 million kilometres) on motorways. Google has been focusing on improving city driving for the past year. So far, the tech giant has focused street driving in Mountain View, California. But it predicts that the public could get hold of the technology within 3 years. While following a route on Google Maps, the app will now tell a driver which lane to stay in or move to when they approach a turn. This should hopefully prevent a person from driving miles down the road in the wrong direction after mission a junction. Another useful feature is the ability to download maps for offline use. Although this isn’t entirely new, there way in which it is accessed has been made much simpler. Now a user only need to tap ‘Save map to use offline’ in a location’s info sheet to view it without an Internet connection. This will be especially useful if you know you’re heading somewhere with poor signal and no Wi-Fi. Users can save multiple maps and give each a name to easily navigate through them. They’ll appear by tapping the profile icon by the search icon in the top right corner of the screen. Clicking on a location and tapping 'Save map to use offline' will now let you store maps of an area for use when you haven¿t got an Internet connection . The new filters feature lets you browse restaurants, bars and hotels according to opening hours, rating, price and more where available to more easily find what you're looking for . Elsewhere, there is an upgrade to Google’s ‘search nearby’ feature. Now mobile users can browse through restaurants, bars and hotels with filters. You can select opening hours, rating, price and more to find what you’re after. Perhaps most excitingly is the new integration with the popular taxi app Uber. This has shot to prominence with many now using the instant payment app to book taxis. In the Maps app, users can now compare the taxi ride you’re going with other modes of transportation like walking or public transport. If a person sticks with the taxi, selecting the Uber option will take you into the Uber app. The new app also features integration with popular taxi app Uber, letting you compare your taxi route with other modes of transport. You can also launch the Uber app directly from Maps . Tapping the train icon at the top of the screen will now allow you to search for departure times on a specific time and day when planning a journey . Google has also now integrated more train information into the app, so people can select a departure time to find out which train to catch. The final two features revolve around visiting attractions. Users can now star locations to take a look at later from within the app or from another device. It is also possible to instantly dive into Street View at the touch of a button to get a better look around. ‘So, next time you’re caught up in a whirlwind of activity, make navigating your world a little easier,’ Google says in their release statement. ‘Take a moment to grab your phone, open up the Google Maps app, and find all you need to search, navigate and explore the world around you.’ Starring a location will save it for later so you can view it from other devices. This is found by tapping on the place card of a location and hitting the star icon . Tapping on the place card will also let you easily dive into Street View mode, enabling you to explore a destination in first-person within the newly updated Google Maps app .","Google has released a new update for its Maps app on iOS and Android .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . As the race to get to Mars heats up, new research suggests that dormant life could be hiding in the red planet’s frozen water. If found, these microbes could someday be brought back to life, according to a team of scientists from Arizona and the Netherlands. The theory is based on evidence that Mars was hit by a huge flood millions of years ago when a large ice-covered lake cracked open. Scroll down for video... Victor Baker at the University of Arizona in Tucson and Manuel Roda at Utrecht University recently made a detailed study of a Martian crater called Aram Chaos (pictured). They believe microbes in this region could have been 'frozen' after they were brought to the surface millions of years ago by a flood in the region . Evidence of water on Mars dates back to the Mariner 9 mission, which arrived on Mars in 1971. Mariner 9 imaging revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs. Viking . orbiters that followed caused a revolution in theories about water on . Mars by revealing how floods broke through dams, carved deep . valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and traveled thousands of . kilometres. Mars . is currently in the middle of an ice age, so liquid water cannot exist . on its surface at the present time. However, the planet seems to have . been warmer and wetter in the past. In June last year, Curiosity rover found 'powerful evidence' that water good enough to drink once flowed on Mars. In . September, the first scoop of soil analysed by Curiosity revealed that . fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water . by weight. Today, Mars' polar caps are known to be mostly water ice. Frozen water has also been detected just under the surface at mid-latitudes. But the planet was once a far more watery world. Several huge channels, dating from a time when Mars was just starting to evolve into the cold desert it is today, can be found on the planet’s deep chasms and impact craters. Victor Baker at the University of Arizona in Tucson and Manuel Roda at Utrecht University recently made a detailed study of a Martian crater called Aram Chaos. This crater has a channel 6.2 miles (10 km) and 1.2 miles (2 km) deep, which would have required almost 320,0000 ft3 (90,000 km3) of water to have flowed through it in a month. The researchers believe that a lake filled the crater when Mars was warmer. As the planet cooled, the lake froze solid and was covered in a layer of rock, according to a by Lisa Grossman in New Scientist. However, the scientists argue that at the same time, geothermal energy warmed the ice from below, creating a liquid layer. Over thousands of years, the weakened sediment collapsed, breaking the ice and letting water gush to the planet’s surface. Today, Mars' polar caps (northern cap pictured) are known to be mostly frozen water ice. Frozen water has also been detected just under the surface at mid-latitudes where meteorite impacts have uncovered it . This, according to the researchers, means that any microbial life in the liquid lake may have become dormant as the water refroze on an icy Mars. ‘Maybe these outflow channels are places where these dormant organisms came into a living state and would then have gone dormant again,’ Professor Baker told New Scientist. ‘Microbes could be waiting for us to drill a hole and sample ice and bring them back to life.’ On Earth, at least two types of bacteria have been found to happily live beneath a glacier in Mars-like temperatures. In a 2012 study, the bacteria—Chryseobacterium and Paenisporosarcina—showed signs of respiration in ice designed to simulate as closely as possible the temperatures and nutrient content found at the bottom of Arctic and Antarctic glaciers. Researchers at Penn State University found that organisms could survive at temperatures ranging from -33 °C to -4.4°C . Super bugs from Earth could soon hitch a ride into space, arrive on the red planet and trick scientists into thinking they are Martians. This is according to Nasa researcher, Dr Kasthuri Venkateswaran, who has expressed serious concern that microbes may beat humans in the race to colonise Mars. Dr Venkateswaran highlights recent research that shows some bugs are more resilient than first thought and could use protective mechanisms to survive deep space flights. Currently, spacecraft landing on Mars or other planets where life might exist must meet requirements for a maximum allowable level of microbial life. These acceptable levels were based on studies of how various life forms survive exposure to the challenges associated with space travel. ‘If you are able to reduce the numbers to acceptable levels, a proxy for cleanliness, the assumption is that the life forms will not survive under harsh space conditions,’ Dr Venkateswaran said. However, spores of Bacillus pumilus have shown high resistance to techniques used to clean spacecraft, such as ultraviolet radiation and peroxide treatment. When researchers exposed this hardy . organism to a simulated Mars environment that kills standard spores in . 30 seconds, it survived 30 minutes.","Researchers believe that a lake .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Astronomers have been able to capture unprecedented images of a mysterious gas that connects galaxies throughout the universe. Known as the intergalactic medium (IGM), this enigmatic substance has, up until now, merely been a matter of theoretical speculation. But now Caltech scientists have used the Cosmic Web Imager (CWI) to obtain their first three-dimensional images of the IGM. Astronomers have been able to capture unprecedented images of a mysterious gas that connects galaxies throughout the universe. Pictured is an image of quasar - a nucleus of a young galaxy - showing surrounding gas (in blue) and the direction of filamentary dim matter . Dim matter is the mysterious gas that connects galaxies throughout the universe. Since . the late 1980s and early 1990s, theoreticians have predicted that . primordial gas from the Big Bang is not spread uniformly throughout . space. Instead, it distributed in channels that span galaxies and flow between them. This . ‘cosmic web’- the IGM - is a network of smaller and larger filaments . crisscrossing one another across the vastness of space and back through . time to an era when galaxies were first forming. Of normal matter, only one-quarter is made up . of stars and galaxies, the bright objects that light our night sky. The remainder, which amounts to only about three per cent of everything in the universe, is the IGM. The images could help astronomers better understand the structure of the cosmic web that flows through the universe to understand how it affects galaxies. The IGM was imaged near two very bright objects; a quasar – which is the nucleus of a young galaxy - called QSO 1549+19, and something called a Lyman alpha blob – a huge concentration of a gas. They found a single filament feeding into the quasar which was one million light-years long, and three filaments flowing into the Lyman alpha blob. These filaments are estimated to have origins from approximately 2 billion years after the Big Bang. The Cosmic Web Imager, used on the Hale telescope in California, was conceived and developed by Caltech professor of physics Christopher Martin. ‘I've been thinking about the intergalactic medium since I was a graduate student,’ he said. ‘Not only does it comprise most of the normal matter in the universe, it is also the medium in which galaxies form and grow.’ Since the late 1980s and early 1990s, theoreticians have predicted that primordial gas from the Big Bang is not spread uniformly throughout space. Instead, it distributed in channels that span galaxies and flow between them. Dim matter was imaged near two very bright objects; a quasar ¿ which is the nucleus of a young galaxy - and something called a Lyman alpha blob ¿ a huge concentration of a gas. Pictured is a comparison of Lyman alpha blob observed with Cosmic Web Imager and a simulation of the cosmic web based on theoretical predictions . This ‘cosmic web’- the IGM - is a network of smaller and larger filaments crisscrossing one another across the vastness of space and back through time to an era when galaxies were first forming. Professor Martin describes the diffuse gas of the IGM as ‘dim matter,’ to distinguish it from the bright matter of stars and galaxies, as well as dark matter. He explained that 96 per cent of the mass and energy in the universe is elusive dark energy and dark matter. Scientists only know of it due to its effects on the remaining four per cent that we can see: normal matter. Of this four per cent that is normal matter, only one-quarter is made up of stars and galaxies, the bright objects that light our night sky. Earlier this year, the mysterious strands of dark matter that hide beneath the visible universe were seen for the first time. Dark matter is considered crucial to theories explaining how the universe is expanding and how galaxies interact, but has so far eluded scientists. In January, astronomers produced the first direct images of a part of its network using a quasar as a ‘flashlight’. A quasar is a type of active galactic nucleus that emits intense radiation powered by a supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy. This particular quasar, located 10 billion light-years away, illuminated a vast nebula of diffuse gas to reveal the network of filaments that connect galaxies in a cosmic web. For years, cosmologists have been running computer simulations of the structure of the universe to develop what they refer to as the ‘standard model of cosmology’. Their calculations suggest that as the universe grows, matter becomes clustered like a huge cosmic web, weaving its way into in filaments and nodes under the force of gravity. The results from the 10-metre Keck telescope in Hawaii, were reported by scientists from the University of California, Santa Cruz and the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg. Computer simulations suggest that matter in the universe is distributed in a 'cosmic web' of filaments, as seen in the image above from a large-scale dark-matter simulation. The inset is a zoomed-in, high-resolution image of a smaller part of the cosmic web, 10 million light-years across . The remainder, which amounts to only about three per cent of everything in the universe, is the IGM. As the name suggests, ‘dim matter’ is hard to see. Matt Matuszewski, a former graduate student at Caltech likens it to trying to see a complex cityscape through a few narrow slits in a wall. ‘All you would know is that there is some concrete, windows, metal, pavement, maybe an occasional flash of colour,’ he said. ‘Only by opening the slit can you see that there are buildings and skyscrapers and roads and bridges and cars and people walking the streets. ‘Only by taking a picture can you understand how all these components fit together, and know that you are looking at a city.’ Professor Martin and his team have now seen the first glimpse of the city of dim matter. It is not full of skyscrapers and bridges, but it is both visually and scientifically exciting. Dim matter was seen by the Cosmic Web Imager installed at the Palomar Observatory in California .","The images were captured using the Cosmic Web Imager in California .

This is according to Nasa researcher, Dr Kasthuri Venkateswaran, who has expressed serious concern that microbes may beat humans in the race to colonise Mars. Dr Venkateswaran highlights recent research that shows some bugs are more resilient than first thought and could use protective mechanisms to survive deep space flights. In a simulated Martian environment some spores in the study were able to survive at 1.5 years - and some had become even hardier than when they arrived. Pictured is a close up of of Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032 spores on aluminum before (left) and after (right) exposure to space conditions . Currently, spacecraft landing on Mars or other planets where life might exist must meet requirements for a maximum allowable level of microbial life. These acceptable levels were based on studies of how various life forms survive exposure to the challenges associated with space travel. ‘If you are able to reduce the numbers to acceptable levels, a proxy for cleanliness, the assumption is that the life forms will not survive under harsh space conditions,’ Dr Venkateswaran said. However, spores of Bacillus pumilus have shown high resistance to techniques used to clean spacecraft, such as ultraviolet radiation and peroxide treatment. Bacillus pumilus is a a rod-shaped bacteria that, on Earth, resides in soils and the root area of some plants. In one study, Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032 spores were exposed for 18 months on the European Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF). Pictured is the EuTEF attached to the Columbus module of the International Space Station during orbital flight . Nasa chiefs have said that sending a manned mission to Mars is 'necessary if the human race is to survive'. But the huge amounts of chemical rocket fuel needed to complete such a mission would require deep pockets – the launch costs alone would be more than $12 billion (£7 billion). Added to this is the time it takes. The space agency estimates that a round-trip human expedition to Mars would take more than four years using current technology. Rocket-powered fusion, however, could one day allow 30- and 90-day expeditions to Mars by making the trip more practical and less costly, experts claim. Scientists envision using a nuclear reactor to heat hydrogen to very high temperatures, which will then expand through a spacecraft’s nozzle to generate thrust. Recent advances in manipulating nuclear fusion could means that astronauts are now a step closer to our nearest planetary neighbour. When researchers exposed this hardy organism to a simulated Mars environment that kills standard spores in 30 seconds, it survived 30 minutes. For another study, Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032 spores were exposed for 18 months on the European Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF). ‘After testing exposure to the simulated Mars environment, we wanted to see what would happen in real space and EuTEF gave us the chance,’ Dr Venkateswaran said.‘To our surprise, some of the spores survived for 18 months.’ These surviving spores had higher concentrations of proteins associated with UV radiation resistance and, in fact, showed elevated UV resistance when re-exposed on Earth. The findings could provide an insight into how super bugs are able to survive in extremely hostile regions on Earth and how these microbes are affected by radiation. In another investigation, other spore-forming bacteria Bacillus subtilis were dried on pieces of spacecraft-quality aluminum and subjected for 1.5 years to the vacuum of space, cosmic and extra-terrestrial solar radiation and temperature fluctuations. Most of the organisms exposed to solar UV radiation in space and in the Mars spectrum were killed, but when UV rays were filtered out and samples were kept in the dark, about 50 per cent or more of those subjected to other space- and Mars-like conditions survived. After the study, Bacillus pumilus bacteria spores had higher concentrations of proteins associated with UV radiation resistance and, in fact, showed elevated UV resistance when re-exposed on Earth . A third study placed rock-colonising cellular organisms in the EuTEF facility for 1.5 years, further testing a theory of how organisms might move from one planet to another, known as lithopanspermia. In this scenario, rocks ejected from a planet by impact with, say, a meteor, carried organisms on their surface through space and then landed on another planet, bringing that life with them. For this investigation, researchers selected organisms especially adapted to cope with the environmental extremes of their natural habitats on Earth, and found that some are also able to survive in the even more hostile environment of outer space. The findings will also help prevent scientists from incorrectly identifying an organism that hitchhiked on the exploring spacecraft as a native of the planet, when in fact it was an invader.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Hundreds of thousands of video gamers are right now plugged into one computer game. But it’s not the latest Call of Duty or Fifa – it’s a science based game called EyeWire in which users map the neurons of a brain. And information collected from the gamers using the crowdsourcing programme has been used to map neurons in an eye’s retina for the first time. An online video game known as EyeWire has been used to help map the neurons in the retina of a mouse, which can in turn be applied to that of a human. Outlined in the journal Nature, the study relied on information crowdsourced by thousands of gamers. The popular game has been running since late 2012 and shows how games can be used to help research in various branches of science. In this image, different cells in the retina have been traced in various colours by gamers . The findings were announced in the journal nature by a team including Professor Sebastian Seung of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Light from an object passes through your pupil into your eye. Depending on how bright the light is, your iris changes size. The lens then focuses this light onto the your retina at the back of your eye. The retina is composed of light-sensitive neurons known as photoreceptors that change light signals into electrical signals. These are then transmitted to the brain where an image is formed. Professor Seung’s lab at MIT has been running the hugely popular EyeWire game since late 2012, which contributed to the study. The latest discovery is a huge boon for the game and shows how useful crowdsourcing can be in various branches of science. In the game, players are given layers of a a retina - in this case one of a mouse - which is similar to a human’s in many ways. By making a plastic print of a retina, a 3D replication is made on a computer screen. Gamers are then tasked with individually mapping out the neurons by scrolling up and through the various layers. In EyeWire, users are given blocks of cells within a retina of a mouse that has been moulded in plastic and scanned into the system. Gamers then intricately study the layers of cells and trace out the paths of neurons. Together, with multiple gamers tackling the same section, an accurate map of the neuron is made and a 3D representation, as seen in this image, can be made. Here in yellow-green is a starburst amacrine cell, while in blue is a single bipolar . Multiple users tackle different parts of the membrane and, to eliminate errors, some map the same cells as others. As neurons are mapped, gamers gain points, with expert users going keeping an eye on things in case mistakes are made. The game doesn’t require users to have any background in biology though, allowing anyone to pick up and get involved with the project. ‘You no longer have to have a PhD in neuroscience,’ said Amy Robinson, creative director of EyeWire, told NBC News. ‘You could be a high-school student, or a sculptor, a dental assistant or retiree. All you have to have is now an Internet connection and an interest in gaming.’ Over 120,000 gamers have signed up from 100 countries to play EyeWire. But to solve this particular retina challenge, a selection of just over 2,000 of the best ‘EyeWirers’ mapped the so-called starburst amacrine cells, which are found in the retina, and they are all listed as co-authors on the paper. The EyeWire team are now looking at new challenges for their gamers to overcome. These include taking a look at the connections between smells and emotional responses. Here another starburst amacrine cell is shown in red, along with three bipolar cells. Starburst cells are used by retinas for selecting a direction to look, and they also help retinas develop over time. Bipolar cells, meanwhile, act as signal couriers between photoreceptors (which gather light) and ganglion cells that take the signals into the cortex of the brain. Aside from retinas, it is hoped that future EyeWire projects will map other functions of the brain as well .","Thousands of video gamers have used an online programme to help scientists map neurons in retinas .

"By . Bianca London . Scroll down for video . From images of Kim Kardashian’s bikini-clad body on the beach, to the regular full body celebrity ‘selfies’ that fill our Twitter timelines, there's just no escaping images of toned women wearing next to nothing. And as we approach bikini season, it seems that these images are doing more than simply turning women in the UK green with envy. More and more people are opting to invest in body-sculpting cosmetic procedures to help them achieve the ultimate toned figure in the lead-up to summer. New treatment trend: Rather than pinpointing one 'problem area' to target, more of us are opting to target multiple areas of our bodies in order to achieve an all over sculpted figure. Kyla Lynn-Evans, pictures, left, before and, right, after tried it out . According to one cosmetic surgery group, demand for body shaping procedures is on the up. The Private Clinic of Harley Street has witnessed a 21 per cent increase, year on year, in the number of women opting to undergo VASER liposuction, a minimally invasive procedure which gently sculpts areas of the body. But rather than pinpointing one 'problem area' to target, more of us are opting to target multiple areas of our bodies in order to achieve an all over sculpted figure ready for when we need to pull out the bikini. Dr Edwin Anthony, Cosmetic Doctor at The Private Clinic, said: 'Many female patients I see explain that, for them, the ultimate goal is to look good and feel confident in a bikini. Patients are often influenced by photographs of female celebrities looking toned and in shape in swimwear, but I think the change has also been triggered by a gradual change in attitudes amongst women. Bottoms up! One clinic has witnessed a 21 per cent increase, year on year, in the number of women opting to undergo the minimally invasive procedure which gently sculpts areas of the body, like the bottom, pictured, left, after and, right, before . 'In particular, the notion of one ""problem area"" on the body is slowly disappearing and instead women are working harder to achieve the overall body size and shape they desire by combining a body sculpting procedure such as VASER with an active exercise regime and a healthy, nutritious diet.' Of all female patients who underwent the treatment, almost three quarters of them (73 per cent) decided to target two or more areas of their body, as opposed to targeting just one problem area. Dr Anthony believes these figures are particularly important: 'The fact that only around a quarter of female patients pinpoint one area that they would like to sculpt tells us that the objectives of women in terms of their body shape is perhaps changing slightly. 'Years ago it was very common for women to come to me looking to remove fat from their thighs, for example, or to sculpt and shape their flanks alone. Now, however, this approach has become less common and we are witnessing the prevalence of a more holistic approach. This is also, I believe, a result of advances in technology that have led to quicker recovery times and a faster return to work for patients. What's the reason? Dr Anthony believes that the objectives of women in terms of their body shape is perhaps changing slightly as they opt to target all over - is this celebrity culture's fault? Kyla pictured, left, after and, right, before . 'More and more female patients today understand that a cosmetic procedure which sculpts multiple areas of the body can help them towards achieving the body shape and size they desire, but that this is only the case if they combine such a procedure with a healthy diet and a positive exercise regime. 'The majority of patients now understand that cosmetic surgery is not a quick fix but is something which, when delivered hand in hand with an overall healthy lifestyle, can help them towards achieving their goals. This more holistic approach to shaping up is a trend I expect to see continue.' One patient who has undergone the treatment is 27-year-old Kyla Lynn-Evans. Kyla, from London is size 14 and opted to target her stomach, hips, inner, front and outer thighs, her saddle bags and her chin. Body confident: Kyla, pictured, left after and, right, before, says she still has a curvy figure but feels her body looks more sculpted and she have better definition . 'I have always had an hour glass figure,' she said. 'I have a small waist, curvy hips, and quite large thighs. I eat well, I go to the gym regularly and I don’t mind having a curvy figure, but I have always wished that my body was more toned and sculpted. There were always areas, like my hips and my inner thighs, which I just wished I could tone up. 'I decided to undergo this, not as a quick fix solution, but as a means of targeting the stubborn areas of fat on my body. I felt the procedure would help give me the motivation I needed, moving forward, to keep my body in the shape I wanted it to be. 'Now, after the procedure, I still have a really curvy figure but I feel my body looks more sculpted and I have better definition. I feel more confident in a bikini and generally just a lot more positive about my body shape.' Is it all her fault? Kim Kardashian has previously . stated that her penchant for post-pregnancy selfies and belfies is her . way of putting 'two fingers up' to those who criticised her baby body - and it seems she's inspiring women to get body sculpting treatments .","Firms see 21% rise in female VASER liposuction patients .

"By . Katy Winter . Wedding bells are ringing for a loved-up man who stunned his girlfriend with a heart-melting flash-mob proposal. The grand gesture was secretly organised by Marc Fury, 34, from Cardiff, who popped the question to long-term girlfriend Naomi Coleman, 36, over dinner. Marc arranged for choir group Sing & Inspire to turn up for the ultimate proposal, and after being serenaded by a mash-up of Bruno Mars’ ‘Just the Way You Are’ and Whitney Houston’s ‘I Wanna Dance with Somebody’, he plucked up his courage and got down on one knee. Scroll down for video . Marc and Naomi pictured at the restaurant on the night of their engagement, after being serenaded by a full choir . Marc organised whole event in just three weeks, having seen a flashmob and deciding it would be the perfect way for him to pop the question . His startled partner immediately said yes before planting a kiss on his lips as the singing group and fellow-diners burst into rapturous applause. Father-of-one Marc, who kept his big idea under-wraps for weeks, said: 'I kept the plan as close to my chest as possible so it wouldn’t ruin the surprise. 'I was really nervous, I couldn’t look at anyone in the restaurant when we turned up because I knew all the choir were already there. 'Even when people started pointing us out as the choir sang Naomi still didn’t believe it was just for us. 'It was a wonderful evening and we’ve had such a lovely response from everyone.' Marc managed to organise the whole thing for his partner of three years in just three weeks after seeing a flashmob perform at a housing conference in Cardiff. He admits that he doesn’t remember much of the meal before the choir got up to sing, but the proposal was unforgettable. Sing & Inspire serenaded the pair with  a mash-up of Bruno Mars' 'Just the Way You Are' and Whitney Houston's 'I Wanna Dance with Somebody' 'The bit . beforehand was all a blur, don’t ask me what I had to eat,' he laughs. 'The cue for the choir to start was for Naomi to stop eating, so I was . just watching her and waiting. I knew that a lot of the people at the . tables around us were part of the choir and I was trying not to make any . eye contact with anyone. 'When . the choir stood up and started singing around us, Naomi kept saying it . looked like they were singing to us, but I said I didn’t have a clue and . that it was nothing to do with us. 'She didn’t realise until I got down on one knee. It was an amazing night and we have watched the video over and over again.' Meanwhile, Naomi, 36, admitted that she is still in shock and has still not completely taken it all in. 'Marc didn’t give a thing away, even when they got up to sing,' she says. Naomi was so unsuspecting that when the group first started to sing she couldn't believe it was for her . 'I didn’t realise until I saw him reaching into the inside pocket of his jacket. It was incredible, absolutely fabulous.' Stef Evans, from choir group Sing and Inspire, was only too happy to help when nervous Marc asked if they could help out with his flashmob proposal. She said: 'We had done a flash mob at a conference Marc attended and he approached us to help out with the proposal. 'Then we spoke to Karen, the manager of The Cosy Club restaurant and she was brilliant and very excited about it.' More than forty people filled the restaurant to sing for the couple, many of them from the choir of homeless charity Llamau, but Naomi was clueless that all the fuss was for her. Singer Stef added: 'I don’t think she realised why we were doing it even though we were standing in right in front of her. 'I don’t know how Marc managed to eat his food he was so anxious, but whose proposal can beat that?'","Romantic Marc organised whole event in just three weeks .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Storing data on tapes may seem a little antiquated, since the invention of CDs, cloud services and other forms of digital storage, but it is still used by many businesses and archives around the world. And now, by tweaking how it produces this magnetic tape, Sony has created a way to boost the potential of the iconic material to not only match its digital rivals, but also surpass them. The Japanese firm has developed tape for businesses that can store up to 185TB of data - 74 times the capacity of traditional tapes and the equivalent of 3,700 Blu-rays.

It could, in theory, be used by anyone but has been designed specifically for organisations that need to store large amounts of data. Magnetic tapes with a coating of magnetic powder are currently used as the mainstream form of tape storage media - with a recording capacity of 2.5TB. Previously, if companies wanted to increase this capacity, they’d need to use technology to shrink the size of the magnetic particles on which data is stored. This can be a tricky and expensive process, and in many cases, isn’t cost effective.

"HBO series True Detective is the TV phenomenon of the year. And while Carrie Bradshaw and her Sex and the City girls embraced New York City as an extra character in their show, detectives Rustin 'Rust' Cohle and Marty Hart have an imposing - if slightly dangerous - version of Louisiana as their backdrop. The southern American state is drenched in drama and history, and as the thrilling TV manhunt reveals a darker side to the sleepy Southern stretch travel fans are treated to a display of fascinating nature and architecture. The sweeping landscape shots including bayou banks, lush fields and sprawling trees play a huge part in adding to the show's cinematic style. So taking inspiration from the hot show and its brooding stars we look at five ways to enjoy Louisiana (that don't involve serial killers, corduroy suits or CID squads). Scroll down for video .

Take a cocktail tour: Booze and . bars feature heavily in the series and while we definitely wouldn't . condone turning to the bottle with quite as much enthusiasm as Detective . Cohle there's no denying that the people of Louisiana know how to enjoy . a drink. New Orleans is king when it comes to cocktails, holding the . honour of inventing the drink in the form of the Sazerac, when local . chemists mixed cognac with absinthe and bitters as a medicinal tonic. The Gray Line company . offers a cocktail-based walking tour of the city's pretty French Quarter . that acts as a history tour with a twist, including tipples such as . the Hurricane, the Mint Julep and the Gin Fizz.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . We're a nation of scrimpers and savers when it comes to booking a holiday. But our preconceived ideas about expensive destinations are often misjudged, with many of us overspending despite our keenness for a bargain. As many as 49 per cent of Britons who had never been to France felt it was not a value-for-money country, according to a new survey by Post Office Travel Money. Pricey: Destinations such as the Cote D'azur in the south of France are not seen as value for money . On a budget: Beaches, such as Slanchev Bryag in Bulgaria, are thought to be budget options . Of those who had been to France, only 50 per cent thought it represented good value for money. Based on responses from 2,085 UK adults, the survey showed that of those countries in which holidays had been taken, Turkey was seen to be the best value-for-money destination, followed by mainland Spain, Greece and Portugal. Based on perception rather than actual visits, the country seen as offering the best value was Bulgaria, followed by Turkey, mainland Spain and Croatia. Of countries not visited, Dubai was bottom of the list, with only 38 per cent deeming it a good value-for-money destination. Turkey was the destination to which most people would return. Around two-thirds of people who had been before said they would go back, while 63 per cent would return to mainland Spain. But - on a value-for-money basis - only 29 per cent would go back to Dubai, only a third would return to France and only 40 per cent would make another trip to Italy.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . A couple who claim they were ‘treated like dogs’ and locked in their cabin for 48 hours after falling ill with a vomiting bug on a cruise have received £1,000 in compensation. Shaun and Elizabeth Shields, of Braunstone, Leicester, said they were not allowed to leave their room as staff attempted to tackle an outbreak of norovirus on the ship, Island Escape. The couple, who had paid £1,300 for the luxury cruise, were among nearly 200 passengers who were struck down by norovirus. 'Locked on board': Shaun and Elizabeth Shields claim they were treated 'like dogs' on the Island Escape . Four days into the cruise around the Canary Islands, in January 2010, Shaun, 56, caught the bug, which causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea. He said staff locked him and his wife Elizabeth, 52, in their cabin for two days, in an attempt to prevent the illness spreading. Elizabeth, who didn't have the bug, was not allowed out for a cigarette and they claimed the only food they were given was four cream crackers and cheese. Shaun said: ‘We were treated like dogs. My wife wasn't even ill but we were both locked in our cabin. ‘We were told it was so we didn't spread the disease. Shaun said the couple's room cards - which allowed them to exit their cabin and access public areas of the ship - were disconnected. Compensation: Shaun Shields has been awarded a £1,300 payout after he fell ill on board a luxury cruise . Shaun said: ‘My wife wasn't even allowed to go up to the top deck for a cigarette. When we asked staff, they told her to smoke in the toilet.’ After two days, when Shaun was better, he and his wife were finally allowed out of their cabin, but when they went up to the top deck, ‘there were people being sick everywhere’. Shaun said: ‘It was really bad. All of the staff were wearing masks and gloves, while people were throwing up everywhere and children were crying. About 100 people were ill.’ Shaun said when the ship docked at one of the islands, passengers were sent to hotels while staff ‘deep-cleaned’ the vessel. He said the £1,300 cruise was ‘the worst holiday we have been on’. The couple took legal action and have received a payout of just over £1,000 from cruise operator TUI in an out-of-court settlement. About 200 passengers have claimed compensation for cruises on the Island Escape between December 2009 and June 2010 that were ruined by outbreaks of norovirus. TUI has agreed to pay out hundreds of thousands of pounds in compensation for the claimants, but does not admit liability. Law company Irwin Mitchell, who represented the passengers, said the illness suffered during the cruise made the trip ‘extremely unpleasant’. TUI UK Limited, who Shaun booked the cruise with, declined to comment.","Shaun Shields said staff didn't allow him and his wife to leave their room .

"Pepe Mel will meet West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace to discuss his future . Mel wants reassurances of the club's ambitions next season . West Brom are all but mathematically safe in the Premier League with a vastly greater goal difference over Norwich . By . Mark Staniforth . West Brom boss Pepe Mel believes uncertainty over his future has already left the club behind schedule for next season's Barclays Premier League campaign. Mel will meet with Baggies chairman Jeremy Peace next week to confirm whether or not he has a future at the club after steering them to all-but-mathematical top-flight survival. Uncertain future: Pepe Mel is unsure whether or not he will be manager of West Brom next season . Opinions on Mel's tenure at The Hawthorns have been split, while the experienced Spanish boss is adamant he requires reassurances if he is to remain in charge. Mel said: 'I don't know whether or not West Brom have been working on (next season) for a long time. I haven't myself and of course if I do continue we will be at a disadvantage. 'I need to know what sort of ideas they have got for West Brom in the future. I want to be in the position of fighting for the same sort of position in the league that West Brom achieved last year. 'I understand that last season was very good for West Brom and this season it was disappointing, with three head coaches, but in the end we did amazing work. 'I will have enjoyed it if it has been my last game at West Brom and if not I will plan for the future. I will look back very positively. I have learned a lot of things about how things are done differently.' Clinging on: West Brom are all but assured of Premier League safety with a greater goal difference over Norwich . Mel is anxious for his side to finish their season on a high after the miserable midweek defeat at Sunderland. Liam Ridgewell could return after missing the last three games with a knee injury, while Morgan Amalfitano is also likely to find himself back in the starting line-up after being rested for the trip to the Stadium of Light. But Billy Jones and Zoltan Gera are both definitely out with hamstring injuries and Steven Reid has a groin injury. Welcome addition: Morgan Amalfitano should be fit for West Brom's match against Stoke on Sunday . Mel added: 'I don't think that we will lose 15-0 to Stoke and Norwich will beat Arsenal 3-0 - if that did happen we would obviously be down to the Championship. 'But our attention will be on the game with Stoke City and we need to win this game. 'I hope the fans have an enjoyable game and I hope to really be able to put aside the account we gave of ourselves at Sunderland.'","Pepe Mel will meet West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace to discuss his future .

Furthermore one in three . feel anxious and say they hardly ever smile back at themselves, and a fifth admit they have never been happy with their reflection. Almost a third (30 . per cent) of UK women reveal they actively avoid looking in the mirror, . which is almost double the global average of 17 per cent. Scroll down for video . One in three feel anxious and hardly ever smile back at themselves, the same amount avoid mirrors . Despite . this, image-conscious British women look at themselves in the mirror nearly 5 (4.8) times a . day on average, and 45 per cent say they regularly use shop . windows as mirrors. In light of the shocking statistic from a global report by Dove, the brand have launched their pop-up six week Beauty Project in partnership with Selfridges. Presenter and stylist Gemma Cairney, Daphne Selfe - the world's . oldest supermodel at 85 years old, and All Walks Beyond The Catwalk campaigner Caryn Franklin, were pictured as they unveiled the campaign on Thursday. Distorted mirrors in the windows of the . London department store aim to highlight and challenge women's complicated . relationship with their own reflection, and encourage them to recognise their own beauty . when they look in the mirror. The partnership will also provoke a wider . conversation about how beauty is perceived in society as a whole. Its aim is to make beauty become a source of confidence, rather than anxiety. Gemma Cairney, Daphne Selfe - the world's oldest supermodel, and Caryn Franklin unveiled the campaign . Caryn co-founded the award winning All Walks Beyond the Catwalk initiative which promotes diverse beauty ideals . Beauty, skin and haircare brand Dove have taken over two windows either . side of the front doors of Selfridges with distorting and normal mirrors . revolving in them. They are also releasing a film which dramatizes the struggle that many women have when looking at their reflections. Entitled Mirrors, the film shows the negative reaction women often have when looking at their own reflection in contrast to the joy in young girls. It shows how young girls are strongly influenced by their mothers' behavior and encourages mothers to help their daughters foster a more positive sense of their own beauty. A Dove spokesperson said: 'Women have a very complicated relationship with the mirror and we know this impacts their overall confidence and happiness. Yet women constantly look at their reflection in mirrors, shop windows and lifts to check their appearance. 'We want to encourage women to smile back when they see their reflection and we are using the iconic shop windows at Selfridges to encourage women to develop a more positive relationship with their beauty.' The Selfridges partnership is the latest initiative from Dove as it continues to champion and celebrate a wider definition of beauty where how women look becomes a source of confidence, not anxiety. As part of the partnership, a series of six debates will take place exploring the changing landscape of beauty from the impact of social media on self-esteem, to airbrushing to the future of beauty in the coming decade. Panellists taking part in the debates include Cherry Healey, Lucy Mangan, Gemma Cairney and MP Caroline Nokes. The Beauty Project will run from Thursday May 1 until June 12 .

"By . Michael Zennie . It's a river made famous by Alan Jackson's ode to easy living - but the Chattahoochee is harboring darker secrets these days. The bodies of three people have been pulled from its muddy waters outside Atlanta in less than two weeks - and now the FBI is investigating. The death of at least one of the victims,  34-year-old Perfecto Ochoa Alvarado, has been ruled a homicide. Authorities haven't said whether they think the deaths are related, but the FBI has picked up the latest case. On Sunday, a woman's body was spotted on the bank at the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area's Vickery Creek Park. Deadly Chattahoochee: Authorities have pulled three bodies out of the river in suburban Atlanta in the past 12 days . The first body was pulled from the river near Johns River, Georgia, on May 3. It was identified as 57-year-old Gee Hang. 'It looked to be a female. We could see a tattoo on her back, shirt was kind of bunched up to here, she was laid over log by her stomach. The log had her stuck,' Brandon Davis, who spotted the body, told WSB-TV. Witness Baker Martin said: 'She had no shoes on and designer jeans, so no business being in the river, or planning on being in the river.' The Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office has not yet ruled on a cause of death and is waiting for a toxicology report. Murdered: The death of Perfecto Ochoa Alvarado, 34, whose badly decomposed body was found in the river on May 5, was ruled a homicide . Alvarado was found dead May 5 on the banks of the Chattahoochee River by two fishermen . She had not been reported missing before she was found dead. Two days after Ms Hang was discovered, fishermen spotted the badly-decomposed remains of Alvarado. Investigators say Alvarado was killed up to two weeks before his body was found near Austell, Georgia. His death was ruled a homicide, though authorities have not said how he died or where he was killed. Authorities have not released the identity of the woman found dead Friday. The FBI is investigating the case because the remains were found on federal land in a national recreation area.","Gee Hang, 57, was found dead in the river outside Atlanta on May 3 .

"By . Sebastian Shakespeare . Nick Clegg failed to make the 25-mile trip from Westminster to Windsor Castle for a private meeting with the Queen last month, but he has managed to spend a staggering amount on long-haul travel. I hear that in just two months this year the Deputy Prime Minister racked up a bill of more than £83,000, to be picked up by the taxpayer. Cabinet Office records disclose that the Liberal Democrat leader spent £54,537 in February and £28,692 the previous month. The jet-setting son of a Dutch oil executive has made as many major foreign trips in the past few months as he had in the previous three years. British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg talks to media during his visit to the archeological site of Great Temple in Mexico City in February. He has spent £83,000 on long-haul travel in two months . The claims for January and February cover his visits to Spanish-speaking Colombia and Mexico. Clegg’s wife, Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, 45, is Spanish. He spent another £31,859 last September when he led a delegation of six to a United Nations gathering in Washington. Justifying the South American trade missions, the Cabinet Office says they helped to secure business deals worth ‘hundreds of millions of pounds’. It stresses that the travel costs include all other ministerial travel during the same month to engagements in the UK. The Cabinet Office said the visits have helped secure 'hundreds of millions of pounds' for UK business . ‘It was the biggest UK delegation ever to visit Colombia, and one of the biggest to visit Mexico,’ Clegg’s spokesman tells me. ‘Hundreds of millions of pounds of business was done during the visit and companies were introduced to new markets and potential customers that will increase trade for years to come. ‘In addition to the obvious trade benefits, political links were strengthened as the Deputy Prime Minister held meetings with the presidents and senior ministers from both countries.’ Clegg, 47, who speaks Dutch, German, Spanish and French, was joined on his trip to Colombia and Mexico by Trade and Investment Minister Lord Livingston, Mexico trade envoy Baroness Bonham-Carter and more than 40 UK business leaders. Companies represented included HSBC bank, engine manufacturers Rolls-Royce, oil and energy firm Shell, commercial banknote printer De La Rue and architects Zaha Hadid, plus senior representatives from British universities. Clegg should be applauded for reaching Latin America. As I may have mentioned before, after he failed to turn up for a fourth meeting with the Queen last year, his aide spluttered: ‘The f****** fact is he can’t f****** be everywhere, but I know you are going to go off and write that the DPM has f****** snubbed the Queen once a-f******-gain.’","Deputy Prime Minister spent £54,537 on travel in February, records show .

"By . Ray Massey . Rake-off: Machines that swallow users' change have made millions for local authorities . Motorists are being short-changed by millions of pounds as council chiefs profit from pay-and-display parking machines that don’t give change, the RAC Foundation has warned. Local authorities could be coining it in by up to £38million a year by swallowing overpayments, analysis of new figures reveals. One local authority has admitted creaming off £650,000 in just two years from motorists who have been denied the correct change from their parking fee. The RAC called for an end to the unfair rake-off and said town halls had already made a £594million profit from council car parks and on street bays last year. RAC Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: ‘This is adding insult to injury. Many would say charges are already too high without drivers having no choice but to pay for parking they do not need.’ Cornwall Council disclosed in answer to a Freedom of Information request that it collected what it calls an ‘estimated over-vend’ of £649,404 in 2011-12 and 2012-13 on parking income of £23,611,678 – equivalent to 2.7 per cent. Overpayments have also been reported in Bournemouth and Poole in Dorset, Exeter, Devon, and Preston, Lancashire, along with Carmarthenshire and Bridgend in Wales, Portsmouth and by Craven District Council, North Yorkshire. Professor Glaister said: ‘We have heard similar stories from several areas of the country. ‘If the situation is replicated across all or most authorities then motorists are being short changed to the tune of many millions of pounds per year. ’ Of Cornwall’s cream-off, he said; ‘This is a council which by its own admission made an £8million ‘profit’ from its parking activities in the last financial year, the 12th highest amount in England. 'Is it seriously suggested some of this cash can’t be used to upgrade machines either to give change or enable other methods of payment such as by phone or by card?.’ RAC Foundation research reveals that councils in England earned £770million from on street parking bays in the 2012-13 financial year and a further £635million from car parks – a total of £1.4billion including a £594million profit after costs are deducted. An estimated 100,000 coin-operated machines were still in use last year despite the creation of phone services . If the same proportion were retained as in Cornwall then town halls received a £37.9million boost by failing to give change. Cashless payments via mobile phone which debit the correct fee are being introduced in many places and card payments are widely accepted. But an estimated 100,000 coin-operated ticket machines were in use at the last count. The RAC report showed that London’s posh Westminster borough earned the most in takings overall from on and off street parking fees – £77.9million in 2012-13. Outside London, Brighton & Hove Council had the biggest takings at £24.2million. Cornwall Council, which collected a total of £14.2million, claimed it would be too costly to keep its 250 machines stocked with change. It is introducing cashless payments but said it could not afford to scrap all its older machines. A spokesman said; ‘We do upgrade machines . as they become obsolete.  As they are replaced we will consider other . options for cashless payment.’ The RAC has called for an end to the unfair system, which saw Cornwall Council earn £650,000 in two years . The British Parking Association, which represents councils and parking firms contracted to issue penalties, said parking charges would have to increase further to cover the cost of keeping machines stocked with change. A BPA spokesman said; ‘Dispensing and recycling coins to give change would mean bigger machines and more staff to replenish and maintain them, which would in turn add to costs and increase parking charges. ‘The more cash they hold, the more vulnerable they are to vandalism and thieves. This type of equipment is often targeted by opportunists and organised crime gangs.’ The Local Government Association which represents local authorities in England and Wales said councils are obliged to spend any surplus on local transport projects. An LGA spokesman said: ‘Councils try and make the process as easy as possible for motorists with many offering additional cashless payment options where possible for people who not have the correct change for parking machines. ‘Parking revenue is spent on paying for parking services. Any money left over goes towards transport services like filling potholes, concessionary travel, park and rides, street lights and road improvement projects.’","RAC has called for end to unfair rake-off which made £594m last year .

Justin Thai was killed Wednesday night when he ran behind a car backing out of the driveway. Justin Thai, 2, was killed when his father accidentally ran him over with his car while backing out of the driveway . Behind the wheel was his father, on his way to pick up his other son, only eight months old, from the babysitter. The medical examiner has ruled the death as an accident due to blunt force trauma to the head. The family's priest, Father Joseph Tung Dang, addressed reporters with a picture of the smiling Justin in his hands. 'We are unbelievably . saddened and brokenhearted,' Dang  said on behalf of the family. '(Justin) was . such a blessing with his smiling face to his family with his brief time . here.'

"By . Paul Bentley . and Ian Drury . Warrant officer Timothy Jones, 40, had been drinking with his squadron before taking part in a bisexual group sex party fuelled by Jagermeister liqueurs, port and vodka . A Sergeant major sexually assaulted a lesbian soldier after a debauched party at an Army barracks, a court martial heard yesterday. Warrant officer Timothy Jones, 40, had been drinking with his squadron before taking part in a bisexual group sex party fuelled by Jagermeister liqueurs, port and vodka. He allegedly then ordered others out, locked the door, climbed into bed with the 21-year-old female private and attacked her while she slept. The assault is claimed to have happened at Buckley Barracks in Hullavington, Wiltshire, last May. After the alleged victim reported him, Jones was interviewed under caution and charged with sexual assault. Jones, who is married and has retired from service after being given an honourable discharge, faces prison if convicted by a panel of his peers. Bulford Military Court heard yesterday that 13 soldiers from 9 Theatre Logistic Regiment had a barbecue during the afternoon of May 22 last year before they carried on drinking beer, Jagermeister, port and vodka in one of their rooms. Seven soldiers went to the ‘after party’ where female soldiers took off their tops, played loud music and danced until about 2.30am. Prosecutor David Phillips told the court: ‘Alcohol was consumed by all. During the party the accused kissed another male soldier and started to undress. He was told to put his clothes back on.’ After asking the other men to leave the room ‘to allow the girls some privacy’, Jones locked the door and stayed with the two women, a private and a corporal, before they went to sleep. The private claims she woke to find she had been undressed from the waist down and Jones was sexually assaulting her. Mr Phillips said: ‘She looked down and saw the accused. She was naked from the waist down. She was in shock.’ The court heard the female soldier woke up her partner and took her to the toilet, where she broke down in tears. She reported the attack to another sergeant the next morning. She said she had been drunk during the party, having consumed vodka, about four shots of port, and three ‘Jagerbombs’, a mixture of the spirit and an energy drink. The soldier said she and her partner, who had split up two months earlier before rekindling their romance that day, went to sleep first. Bulford Military Court (pictured) heard yesterday that 13 soldiers from 9 Theatre Logistic Regiment had a barbecue during the afternoon of May 22 last year before they carried on drinking beer, Jagermeister, port and vodka in one of their rooms . ‘She laid down on the bed to go to sleep and so did I. I knew Sergeant Jones was in the room and he just sat at the bottom of the bed, he was awake at the time,’ she added. ‘I know I did not take my bottoms off and I did not know how they came off.’ The woman’s partner, to whom she is now married, told the court that the alleged victim had woken her in the night. They went to the toilet together and the alleged victim was ‘a mess’, she said. Jones denies one charge of assault and suggests the two women, who cannot be named, ‘set him up’. The trial heard that he had previously chastised the alleged victim when she and colleagues were being ‘mischievous’. Defence barrister Jonathan Simpson also said that the woman had back problems, and told her: ‘Your future in the Army was a concern because of your back problem. ‘He [Jones] identified  your back problem and knew it would hold you back. In  some ways, Sergeant Major Jones was a potential problem for you.’ Mr Simpson said the party was a ‘hot night’ during which Jones ‘got his man boobs out’ and ‘was showing everyone his body’. He added: ‘Because you got into bed, it gave you and your ex-girlfriend an opportunity to stitch up and fabricate allegations against Sergeant Major Jones.’ The 9 Theatre Logistic Regiment’s role is to oversee the supply chain on operations, making sure kit and equipment reach the frontline. It is part of the Royal Logistic Corps. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Warrant officer Timothy Jones, 40, had .

"By . Brendan Carlin . Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, an opponent of same-sex marriage, has been accused of trying to sabotage laws allowing gay soldiers to wed in military chapels. Mr Hammond is deadlocked with Culture Secretary Maria Miller, who introduced the laws that mean, from this spring, gay men and women will have the right to marry, including as soldiers in military chapels. The reform was approved last year and called ‘shocking and damaging’ by Mr Hammond. Deadlock: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond is at loggerheads with Culture Secretary Maria Miller after being accused of trying to sabotage laws allowing gay soldiers to wed in military chapels . Last week, talks between Mr Hammond’s and Mrs Miller’s officials failed to agree the regulations concerning military chapels – due to be tabled in the Commons this month. Reliable sources say Mr Hammond maintains that  gay couples must demonstrate – subject to his personal approval – that this would not discriminate against others who use the multi-faith chapels and oppose such marriages. ‘Philip is stonewalling because he doesn’t like gay weddings,’ said one official. A campaigner celebrates outside Parliament after the Queen gave her royal assent to a bill paving the way for the first same sex weddings in 2014 . One of his allies said the demand was only to respect the wishes of other groups and in line with the legislation. Mrs Miller has already brought forward the start of same-sex marriage to March 29. The row could delay the scheduled June start for gay weddings in military chapels.","Hammond now deadlocked with Culture Secretary Maria Miller .

"By . Sarah Harris . Too many children are still starting school without the basic skills they need to be able to learn, the head of Ofsted warned yesterday. Sir Michael Wilshaw said that a ‘significant minority’ of youngsters across the country are ‘simply not ready’ for lessons. More than a third continue to struggle to do simple tasks such as count to ten, write simple words or take turns speaking in class amid a shortage of ‘high quality’ provision. Falling behind: More than a third of five-year-olds are starting school without the ability to count to ten, write simple words or to speak aloud in class (stock image) Around two-fifths of all early years settings such as nurseries and childminders – 5,361 – are ‘not improving fast enough to give children the best start in life, including the skills they need to be ready for school’. They have remained ‘satisfactory’ since the introduction of the Early Years Foundation Stage in 2008 which sets out what is expected of pre-school and reception children, according to Ofsted’s report. Last year, teachers warned that  rising numbers of children were arriving at school still wearing nappies while others were struggling to speak properly. Sir Michael yesterday insisted that . ‘satisfactory’ provision was not effective enough to ‘close the . attainment gap sufficiently quickly’. Warning: Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw said that 'satisfactory' provision isn't good enough to 'close the attainment gap sufficiently quickly' The report – Getting It Right First Time – quotes 2012 Department for Education figures showing that 36 per cent of children start formal learning without a ‘good level of development’. Children are supposed to be able to count reliably to ten, use language such as ‘circle’ or ‘bigger’ to describe shapes and sizes, interact with classmates and take turns to talk and show basic control of objects and tools by the time they start full-time school. But 34 per cent of five-year-olds do not have a good level of  communication, language or literacy. Among children from poorer areas, the figure rises to more than four in ten. Fifteen per cent of five-year-old boys in England cannot write their own name or short words like ‘cat’ or ‘dog’, compared with eight per cent of girls. Some eight per cent of boys cannot count up to ten, compared with five per cent of girls.Sir Michael said the best nurseries and childminders ‘ensure children are given clear routines and procedures that help build self-assurance’. He added that ‘their staff are highly skilled adults who improve the vocabulary, cognitive and social skills of very young children, particularly when they are not able to gain them at home’. He published examples of childminders and nurseries that are managing to bring youngsters up to scratch using imaginative methods. A childminder in West Berkshire uses a ‘superhero skills school’ to engage young boys in their learning. Failing: Two-fifths of all pre-school settings are 'not improving fast enough' to give young children with the skills they need - leaving a 'significant minority' unable to write their name or simple words such as 'cat' or 'dog' (stock image) At Newstead children’s centre,  Barnet, north London, adults and children come together for ‘tea club’ – an opportunity to evaluate the experiences of that day. Southwater village hall pre-school in West Sussex encourages children to use money and real china cups. The Ofsted report says: ‘In the snack area, children spend a very long time selecting their choices and paying for their order with real money. ‘As well as deciding when and what to eat, they are also learning about numbers and money in  realistic situations.’ Others placed a high value on training, with one sending staff on trips to countries as far as Denmark and Italy to learn from the best nurseries.","Sir Michael Wilshaw said a 'significant minority' are 'not ready' for lessons .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . The Tampa executive who 'systematically executied' his wife and two teenage children before setting fire to their home and killing himself had some outstanding property taxes and put in a leave request for 'unspecified reasons' before exacting his plot, it has emerged. Darrin Campbell, 49 - who had no criminal record or history of mental illness and was described as being part of what looked to be 'the perfect suburban family' - spent days preparing for the murder-suicide on Wednesday, buying fireworks and cans of gasoline that would destroy his rented Florida mansion. But according to reports in The Tampa Bay Times, Campbell - who was leasing the five-bedroom home in Avila, known for its luxurious mansions and heavy security, from retired tennis pro James Blake - had recently displayed some odd behavior, in terms of his finances and his career. In February 2006, Darrin and Kimberly Campbell bought a vacant lot in Odessa for $294,000. Scroll down for audio and videos . Executed: Darrin Campbell, left, shot wife, Kimberly, right, in the head with a .40-caliber handgun he bought last year, before killing his son and daughter the same way. Described as the 'perfect family', it has emerged Campbell was dealing with some financial problems . Tragic: Colin, 19 (above), was a well-known member of the varsity baseball team and attended the exclusive and private Carrollwood Day School with his sister, Megan, 15 (below) Tragic: Megan, 15 pictured left and right, . attended Carrollwood Day School. She had just won an award days before the murders. Friends as well as relatives have expressed utter shock over the killings . In March 2011, the local property owners' association placed a lien on the lot for unpaid association fees totaling $8,000, which were apparently paid by February 2012. In both 2008 and 2012, Darrin Campbell was delinquent in paying his property taxes on the lot, though the taxes, totaling about $7,800, were eventually paid. Taxes on the property for 2013 have not been paid. 'We are conducting a financial audit on him to determine if there were some financial issues,'Hillsborough County sheriff's Col. Donna Lusczynski said. 'We do know that he was working up to a point but recently had taken some time off."" Campbell took last week off from his job at VASTEC, the digital records company. On Monday, a VASTEC spokesman said, he requested a leave of absence 'for unspecified reasons', which the company approved. The gun Campbell used in the murders and suicide was a .40-caliber Sig Sauer, a popular handgun he bought in July 2013 at Shooters World, a store and gun range on Fletcher Avenue. Bruce Kitzis, the store's general manager, said Campbell's only visit there was to buy the gun, and that he passed a federally mandated background check before purchasing the weapon. 'It was (about) a year ago, was the only time he came in. We did the background check and everything was fine,' Kitzis said. It's unfortunate. We at Shooters World did everything we could, of course. There are so many wonderful gun owners. It's a tragedy.' Haunting video: A surveillance video has emerged showing Darrin Campbell dressed in a dark-grey T-shirt and shorts buying a pile of fireworks last Sunday . Evidence: The surveillance footage was recorded inside the store Phantom Fireworks . The firecrackers seen in Campbell's shopping cart in the video were reportedly used to start a fire in his home Wednesday . Business as usual: Store clerk Michael Muti (right) who handled the transaction Sunday recalled that Campbell seemed 'normal and chatty' Star rental: The Campbell's rented the home from tennis star James Blake, left. Campbell, right, had had a serious of high-profile and senior jobs in various industries. He had apparently been out of work for a year but had recently secured another good job six months ago as the COO of a digital storage company in Tampa . On Sunday, he bought a large number of fireworks and gas cans, which was caught on CCTV. On Tuesday, he made two purchases of gasoline from different stores. Early Wednesday morning, authorities were called to Avila as the Campbell home went up in flames. Campbell was was formally held responsible for the deaths of his wife, Kimberly Campbell, 51, and children Colin Campbell, 18, and Megan Campbell, 15, who were shot in the head in their bedrooms. He had then placed fireworks throughout the residence, used an accelerant to assist in lighting the fire, lit the fire, and shot himself, Lusczynski. Family members said Campbell had a 'strong marriage'. Campbell's mother Mary said they had 'everything to live for' and were a perfect family. The investigation is likely to focus on Campbell's financial situation. Local realtors estimate Campbell would have been paying $6,000 a month to rent out the 5,000 sq ft home from former tennis star James Blake. The family moved into the rented home so that the children could be near to their private school after selling their previous $750,000 home for a profit. He also had school fees for son Colin,19, and daughter Megan,16, of more than $35,000 a year. Meanwhile, a surveillance video was released late Thursday showing Darrin Campbell dressed in a dark-grey T-shirt and shorts placing stacks of fireworks into a shopping cart at Phantom Fireworks. Remains: This aerial photo shows the burned out home owned by James Blake on Thursday, May 8, a day after it was set alight . Sinister: Fireworks were found strewn around the house and police say an accelerant - probably the gas canisters he bought - were used to start the blaze . Fire: The blaze was so ferocious that firefighters could not get in to examine the grisly scene until the next day . At . one point, Campbell is seen ducking back into an aisle to pick up more . pyrotechnics before handing the cashier $650 in cash for his purchase. Store clerk Michael Muti who handled the transaction Sunday recalled Campbell as being 'normal and chatty.' 'He said he was shopping early for fireworks for the Fourth of July,' Muti said. Neighbors described hearing the fireworks go off as the house burned. 'Geez. What is that popping noise?' a male neighbor said on a 911 call. The gun Campbell used in the murders and suicide was a .40-caliber Sig Sauer, a popular handgun he bought in July 2013 at Shooters World, a store and gun range on Fletcher Avenue . Another 911 caller, a security manager for the gated community, told dispatchers the fire was in the house's garage. Firefighters . have described the scene inside the burnt-out mansion as 'unusual' with . fireworks littered through the five-bedroom home rented from former . tennis player Blake, who was ranked fourth in the world in 2006. Neighbors alerted the emergency authorities when they saw flames leaping from the home. There was no 911 call made from within the property.

The film, Welcome to New York, sees Gerard Depardieu play a 'Mr Deveraux' – said to be modelled after the powerful French politician, who was once a front-runner to become the president of France.

The very adult-themed trailer offers several scenes of Mr Depardieu's character engaging in orgies, having sex with prostitutes and seducing young women. The film is said to echo the real-life story of Mr Strauss-Kahn, who once faced accusations that he tried to rape women in both New York and Paris. However, the charges against him were dropped. The two-hour film, which also stars Nip/Tuck actress Jacqueline Bisset as the character Mr Deveraux’s wife, is set to have its world premiere at midnight on Friday in a private showing on the beach in Cannes. However, it has been excluded from the official programme of the Cannes International Film Festival, which starts on Wednesday. Mr Depardieu, left, with Nip/Tuck actress Jacqueline Bisset, who plays the wife of Mr Deveraux in the new film . Vincent Maraval, producer of the film says the French elite tried to block the making of the movie claining there is an ‘incestuous relationship between the media and political elite’ in France. He told the Independent: ‘No French TV station wanted to finance us. ‘Everyone warned us not to make this film, both our friends and our enemies.’ It has also been reported that Mr Depardieu put some of his own money into making the film, and only took a fee of 100,000 euros for playing the character.

In 2011 Mr Strauss-Kahn was accused by Nafissatou Diallo, a New York chamber maid, of trying to rape her. Lawyers for Mr Strauss-Kahn proved that a sex act which took place was consensual, but he was forced to step down from his $500,000 a-year job at the International Monetary Fund. Diallo then sued Mr Strauss-Kahn, but the two sides reached a financial settlement late last year, the details of which have never been disclosed.","Producer Vincent Maraval claims no French TV station wanted to finance film .

"By . Sam Webb . A church was criticised today over a display promoting Christian Aid Week using a mannequin that had been ‘blacked up’. The window scene features a white tailor’s dummy covered in brown paint to make her look ‘African’. Onlookers were stunned to see a lady putting a white mannequin in the window - then start to paint the skin to illustrate the church campaign to fight poverty in Africa. Insensitive: This mannequin was covered in brown varnish to make it appear 'African' for a church charity display. It has now been taken down . One witness said: 'I couldn't believe it - it's so inappropriate. I can't believe anybody would think that's a good idea in this day and age' The mannequin, which is also holding a black baby and wearing a traditional costume, was installed at the Maidstone United Reformed Church in Maidstone, Kent. But the display - being used to promote Christian Aid Week - caused quite a stir in the town. One witness said: 'I saw a woman putting it together on Friday lunchtime. She seemed like a normal, nice, well-meaning lady. 'But then when I came back from getting a sandwich I saw her stood there painting this white mannequin with varnish. Gone: The display was set up on Friday afternoon and taken down this morning. The church has now apologised . 'I couldn’t believe it - it’s so inappropriate. I can’t believe anybody would think that’s a good idea in this day and age. 'It looks like they could find a black baby doll but didn’t have a black mannequin so used something to make it darker.' Charlotte Jacks, 28, of Goudhurst, Kent, has a four-and-a-half-year-old daughter of mixed race. She said: 'Why would anyone do that? It’s so bad it’s almost a joke. I hope they take it down immediately.' Thousands of shoppers walked past the . figure from the time it was installed on Friday afternoon until it was taken down this morning. Reverend Andrew Royal, the minister of the church, said: 'I would like to apologise on behalf of Maidstone United Reformed Church for any offence caused by the church window display that was put up for Christian Aid week. 'It was not our intention to cause offence - and we have removed the mannequin from the church window. I am extremely sorry for any hurt that was caused.' Christian . Aid Week is an annual charitable event which takes place in the second . week of May, run by a collective of different churches nationwide. Last year, 20,000 churches raised £12million, which was used to help less-fortunate people all over the world, including Africa. Christian .

"By . Tamara Cohen . Labour would guarantee patients an appointment with a family doctor within 48 hours - and within a day in urgent cases, Ed Miliband announced yesterday. He called it a ‘scandal’ that many patients have to wait days to be seen by a GP, and said his party would plough hundreds of millions of pounds into cutting waiting times. But doctors warned against a ‘knee jerk’ return to the 48 hour target, which was in force under the last Labour government, saying it would increase the burden on overstretched GPs. Ed Miliband visited Leighton Hospital in Crewe today before announcing that under Labour voters would get a guarantee to see their GP within 48 hours . Mr Miliband claimed the £100million a year needed to fund shorter waiting times would be found by cutting back on NHS red tape and highly-paid consultants. The number of patients who see a doctor within 48 hours has dropped from 80pc to 40pc under the Coalition, he said. One in four people have to wait a week to be seen. The Labour leader said his ‘guarantee’ would prevent patients who cannot get an appointment with their GP flooding A&E departments and would save the NHS more than £300million. ‘This will be better for patients, because they have better access to their GP surgery; better for the NHS, because it will save money currently spent in A&E; and better for Britain, because it is the kind of health service we need’, he said. The Conservatives called it an ‘unfunded pie in the sky policy’ and said they had scrapped the 48 hour target because doctors found it counter-productive to patient care. Mr Miliband told an audience in Manchester that Labour would allow patients to speak to a doctor or triage nurse, rather than a receptionist on the phone straightaway. If their condition is judged to need immediate attention they can see a GP the same day. All patients would have the right to see a GP at their own practice within 48 hours if they want to, although not necessarily the GP of their choice. Ed Miliband has hit out at the Government's 'scandalous' NHS reforms, which he claims are costing millions of pounds. He wants to scrap the changes to fund more GP appointments . Chaand Nagpaul at the British Medical Association said last year when this policy as suggested that ‘arbitrary targets, even for limited periods, are unlikely to alleviate the pressures on the NHS and could make the situation worse. He added: ‘It is likely to result in a rush for appointments when practices open which could overwhelm GP services and restrict the freedom of GPs to schedule appointments beyond 48 hours for patients with long-term conditions.’ Dr Maureen Baker, chair of the Royal College of GPs, has also warned against a ‘knee jerk’ return to 48-hour targets, but welcomed the promise of extra funding to cut waiting times. She said family doctors regularly see up to 60 patients a day, with the majority of GPs now saying that they fear missing something serious in a patient due to unsafe workloads. ‘GPs want to provide better access for their patients. We support the aspiration that patients should be able to book a GP appointment within 48 hours, as one of a range of options that also includes, for example, the ability to wait for longer to see a GP of their choice’, she said. ‘But the way to achieve this is not the imposition of top-down targets, but tackling the resourcing crisis that is at the root of the rising waiting times affecting general practice.’ She added: ‘While we welcome Mr Miliband’s announcement it must not be another ‘sticking plaster’ solution but part of a broader, long-term, shift in investment’. Labour sources claimed the 48 hour guarantee would not be the same as the previous target, as patients who want to wait more than two days to see their own GP will still be able to. GPs can spend the extra funding as they see fit, by hiring more staff or asking GPs to work longer hours. The cost would be funded by cutting £78million of administration and legal fees associated with EU competition law, and reining in the £3million a month spending on consultants by three health quangos – Monitor, the Trust Development Authority and Commissioning Support Units. Mr Miliband also told an audience of health workers that he would repeal the Health and Social Care Act– the law putting GPs back in charge of health budgets. A Conservative Health Spokesman said: ‘This is an unfunded pie-in-the-sky policy that Labour can't pay for and doctors can't deliver. More unfunded spending would mean more borrowing and more taxes to pay for it. ‘The last Labour Government vandalised the relationship between GPs and their patients by introducing tick-box targets and scrapping family doctors, something we are now putting right. ‘Far from improving access, another top-down target will leave GPs less time with their patients and put more pressure on general practice.’","Labour leader says patients will have right to see family doctor in two days .

"By . John Hall . These tiny matchstick figures may look like characters from a L.S. Lowry painting but they are in fact a group of tourists admiring the vast expanse of Death Valley. Photographer David Hellard, 46, took the shots as the sun rose over vast, colourful cliffs during a two day expedition in the notorious Californian desert. The tiny figures give a sense of the scale of the sprawling landscape, which is the lowest and driest area in North America, and the current holder of the world's highest recorded air temperature - 56.7C in July 1913. Stunning: The tiny matchstick figures in these photographs are in fact a group of tourists admiring the vast expanse of Death Valley. They give a sense of the scale of the sprawling landscape, which is the lowest and driest area in North America and one of the hottest places anywhere on earth . Colours: David Hellard, who doesn't like heights, climbed 650 feet up a steep mountain trail in the Amargosa Range to take his photographs . Light: David Hellard said being scared of heights was actually a benefit to his photographs. 'I really studied the scene. There were a tremendous amount of things to look at, and other people tried moving around to get different views of the same things... I really tried to see what was there,' he said . Mr Hellard, who doesn't like heights, braved a steep climb up a trail to the point from which he took his stunning photographs - 650 feet up a mountain in the Amargosa Range. He was the only one in his group of five friends to spot a group of Germans touring on Harley Davidson motorbikes below. 'I don't think the people were there when I first started shooting, but I'm not sure... I am not a big fan of heights and was so nervous. The trail we climbed up was steep, narrow, and fell off sharply,' he said. 'While other people felt comfortable moving around and changing position, once I got set up I didnt feel like doing a lot of shuffling... With the winds gusting against my back, I could easily imagine my camera and tripod, my camera bag, or even me tumbling over the edge and straight down,' he added. 'The benefit to this was that I really studied the scene. There were a tremendous amount of things to look at, and other people tried moving around to get different views of the same things... I really tried to see what was there and eventually noticed the tiny figures off to my left and down,' Mr Hellard said. Observant: The photographer said the rest of his group were too busy focusing on the rolling hills off to the right of the scene to notice the group of tourists gathered below. He, on the other hand, used the sense of calm he'd had to instill in himself just to climb the mountain to maintain focus while taking the photos . Proud: David Hellard said that he thinks each photo tells a unique and different story. He added that he was immensely happy with how well the colours came out and how sharp the photos were. The photographer lives in Los Angeles with wife Sandy . The photographer said the rest of his group were too busy focusing on the rolling hills off to the right of the scene to notice the group of tourists. He, on the other hand, used the sense of calm he'd had to instill in himself just to climb the mountain to maintain focus while taking the photos. 'I took a number of photos of the area while the sun came up. The colours during that time kept shifting and changing, so I was constantly returning to different 'scenes' laid out before me as they varied,' Mr Hellard said. 'The bright and brilliant reds and magentas you see are a result of the morning light. The cliffs are naturally a sort of yellow, lemon colour mixed with browns or darker reds. The variation in the tones is due to the different strata and sediments of the rock itself,' he added. 'Primarily it's really all about the soft morning light and shooting in the 'golden hours'. There was only a short window in which these photos were possible. After the sun rose, the gentle colours were washed away. About . 10 minutes after I took these photos, the rock formations all . homogenized back to their usual basic browns, yellows and muddy reds, Mr Hellard went on. Otherworldly: David Hellard took a number of photos of the area while the sun came up. He said the colours during that time kept shifting and changing, so he was constantly witnessing different 'scenes' being laid out before him as the sunlight varied' New perspective: After taking the photographs, David Hellard, who lives in Los Angeles with wife Sandy, then hiked back down with his friends for breakfast. He said the desert can be disorienting to someone who's used to a horizon of buildings or being surrounded by corn fields . Inspiration: The tiny matchstick silhouettes in David Hellard's photograph resemble characters from paintings by the Lancashire-born artist L.S. Lowry . After taking the photographs, Mr Hellard, who lives in Los Angeles with wife Sandy, then hiked back down with his friends for breakfast. 'I loved this area a lot. I've never seen anything quite like it. All of Death Valley is magnificent and there's an 'otherworldly' feeling about it... The area is completely unique and there is no place quite like it on Earth,' he said. 'In general, the desert is sometimes overwhelming and you just can't believe you can see that far, that mountains can be that high or stretch so far into the distance,' he added. Mr Hellard said the desert can be disorienting to someone who's used to a horizon of buildings or being surrounded by corn fields. He said that he thinks each photo tells a unique and different story, adding that he was immensely happy with how well the colours came out and how sharp the photos were. 'If I'm going to run the risk of tumbling off the edge, I might as well make it worth it...I think the photos convey the beauty and mystery of the area as well as a sense of serenity and peace,' he said.","David Hellard, 46, took the shots as the sun rose during a two-day visit to the notorious Californian desert .

"By . John Hall . A street artist has filed a cease and desist letter to Apple accusing the company of not seeking permission to use a slogan he claims to own, it has been claimed. James De La Vega, 46, is said to have filed the claim in reaction to Apple's usage of the phrase 'You're more powerful than you think' in its latest high-profile advertising campaign for the iPhone 5S. The New York-based artist is known for writing motivational messages as part of his decade-long 'Become Your Dream' graffiti series, and allegedly claims the phrase Apple is using is so closely associated with his work that other companies have previously approached him to use it. Scroll down for video . Inspiring: New York-based street artist James De La Vega (pictured) is known for writing motivational messages as part of his decade-long 'Become Your Dream' graffiti series . Dispute: James De La Vega is said to have sent a cease and desist letter to technology giant Apple. He apparently claims to have trademarked the phrase 'You're more powerful than you think' De La Vega's inspirational slogans adorn not just walls and streets in New York, but have also previously been used in a range of commercial handbags and fashion accessories. Now he claims that Apple has deliberately adopted one of them without seeking his permission in order to motivate potential customers into buying its products, according to Barbara Ross writing in the New York Daily News. The newspaper quotes the letter De La Vega's lawyer Richard Garbarini allegedly sent to Apple as saying the company has violated the artist's rights as the 'common law owner of the trademark'. Apple's usage of the slogan 'clearly misleads customers into believing De La Vega somehow supports, approves and/or endorses its products' it apparently adds. Well-known: James De La Vega is famous for his street murals and chalk drawings, which can mainly be found in and around the East Harlem area of Upper Manhattan . Motivational: The phrase 'You're more powerful than you think' is used prominently in Apple's latest high-profile advertising campaign for the iPhone 5S (pictured) The letter is said to conclude that De La Vega is hoping to negotiate for a settlement for using the phrase as he wants to avoid filing a lawsuit. De La Vega is famous for his street murals and chalk drawings, which can mainly be found in and around the East Harlem area of Upper Manhattan. He is a graduate of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York state, and a former art teacher at York Preparatory School. A recipient of a Joan Mitchell Foundation Painters & Sculptors Grant in 1999, De La Vega has had some of his work featured at Christie's auction house - although most of his art has been sold through his own East Village gallery, which closed in 2010. A spokesperson for Apple was not immediately available for comment.","James De La Vega claims Apple is using phrase associated with him .

"By . Joel Christie . It was said to have been a double celebration - not only Mother's Day but a fifth birthday party their only daughter. But a family of five were killed on Sunday in a horrific car crash in San Bernadino County, after a van crashed into them, overturned, and landed on top of their car. The driver of the van - who is said to have swerved into the left-hand side and hit the Honda sedan, which was stationary at a stop sign in Hesperia - escaped with only minor injuries. Relatives of the victims - a 25-year-old mother, her husband, two sons, 9 and 2, and daughter, 4 - said they were on their way to Disneyland, which is a about a one hour and 20 minute drive away in Arnaheim, according to CBS LA. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: A family of five were killed when a van landed ontop of their car in Hesperia, California, on Sunday. They were heading to Disneyland for the day . The adult male and the eldest son, 9, managed to make it out of the wreck, but died after being transported to hospital . The driver of the van made it out with only minor injuries and was treated at the scene. No arrests have been made . The girl, whose birthday they were celebrating at the theme park, would have been five on Monday. 'I’ve been to scenes where families have suffered great loss (but) all at once, in such a violent manner, is very rare,' sheriff’s Sgt. Doug Hubbard told KTLA. The collision occurred just before 7.00 am at Main Street and Balsam Avenue in Hesperia, the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department said. Investigators determined that the van was traveling eastbound on Main Street when it went into westbound lanes, collided with a Honda sedan that was stopped at a stop sign, and landed on top of the car. Horrific: It wasn't until after the van was removed from on top of the car that the body of the two-year-old boy was found . Crushed: The family were driving to Disneyland in Arnaheim for the day when the crash occurred. They were stopped at a stop sign .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Computer games company Nintendo has apologised for leaving same-sex relationships out of a 'life simulator' game after criticism by equality activists. Protestors attacked the publisher for not including the option of having gay relationships in Tomodachi Life, a Sims-style title which lets players create characters and populate and island with them. Marketing material for the game, which is for the handheld 3DS console, boasts the the cartoonish characters can 'rap, rock, eat donuts, fall in love, break up, go shopping, play games, and live their crazy lives'. Relationships: The game, pictured above, allows heterosexual marriages, but has no scope for gay relationships . However, American gamer Tye Marini, 23, found that there was an element of his life he could not recreate in the game - his relationship with his boyfriend. Mr Marini uploaded a video saying: 'I wanted to be able to marry . my real-life fiance’s Mii. You import your personalised characters into . the game. You name them. 'You give them a personality. You give them a voice. They just can’t fall in love if they’re gay.' But although the company accepted that . it had failed to 'represent' its audience fully, it said it was not . possible to add a gay marriage feature into the game after it has completed. It instead pledged to add the option to marry within the same sex should it release a sequel to Tomodachi Life, which was released last year in Japan and will released in America and Europe next month. Pledge: Nintendo has said that if it released a sequel to the game in will make sure to include same-sex relationships . A spokesman said: 'We apologise for disappointing many people by failing to include same-sex relationships in Tomodachi Life. 'Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to change this game’s design, and such a significant development change can’t be accomplished with a post-ship patch. 'We pledge that if we create a next instalment in the Tomodachi series, we will strive to design a game-play experience from the ground up that is more inclusive, and better represents all players.' Campaigners welcomed the move, but said Nintendo had responded slowly compared to other games publishers. Titles including fantasy series Fable and The Elder Scrolls, as well as The Sims and sci-fi game Mass Effect have long included the potential for same-sex relationships.","Tomodachi Life, for the 3DS console, does not have include gay relationships .

John Haydon, 72, of Bloxwich, West Midlands, was astonished when he received a message out of the blue from a woman from Tennessee claiming to be his sister. He spent his whole life thinking he was an only child, after the death of his baby brother resulted in his mother Eileen leaving their family home when he was aged just three. Full of joy: John Haydon, 72, meets Diane Messer, 58, at Birmingham New Street train station for the first time . Giving her a hug: Mr Haydon said he had 'been so nervous all morning' before meeting his long-lost sister . The moment: Mr Haydon, of Bloxwich, West Midlands, meets his long-lost sister Mrs Messer, of Tennessee, for the first time at Birmingham New Street train station on April 12 at 2.30pm . Mr Haydon grew up never knowing what . happened to his mother, despite his attempts to trace her. But he . received a message on Facebook from Diane Messer, 58, saying she was his . sister. Mr Haydon said: ‘I . was completely overwhelmed when I received the message online. I had . friends over at the time and I was completely speechless, which was a . first. ‘I had to . read the message over and over again before it finally settled in - I . had a sister. The realisation at my age can’t be put into words. ‘When . Diane messaged me she was asking about my mum. I was excited as I . thought maybe she knew her, but eventually she told me she was her . daughter. I couldn’t believe it. ‘I . still can’t get over it all now - I always wondered if my mum had . settled down again and if I had other family out there but I could never . find any information about where she had gone.’ Surprise: Mr Haydon he received a message on Facebook from Mrs Messer, saying she was his sister . Family: Mr Haydon spent his whole life thinking he was an only child, . after the death of his baby brother resulted in his mother Eileen .

He has now learned that his mother fled to France and worked as painter, before heading to the Caribbean and later to New York where she became a window dresser for Macy’s department store. 'We pushed everyone out of the way and ran over to each other and had a huge hug. I finally felt like my life was complete' John Haydon . Eileen eventually settled down with Mrs Messer’s father, a GI from New Orleans in Louisiana, and had a happy life but never spoke of the family she had left behind. Mrs Messer had already planned her visit to Britain with her husband Doug - to visit her mother’s parents grave and to see where Eileen had grown up - before she even knew about her half-brother. Last month on April 12, the siblings met for the first time outside a WH Smith store at Birmingham New Street train station. Mr Haydon said: ‘I had been so nervous all morning. ‘Even though we had spoken for over six months online every day I was incredibly anxious. We pushed everyone out of the way and ran over to each other and had a huge hug. Memories shared: Mr Hayden and Mrs Messer have spent some time looking through photographs together .

Happy: Mrs Messer (right) had already planned her visit to Britain before she even knew about Mr Haydon (left) ‘I finally felt like my life was complete. We have such a great relationship and already pull pranks on each other - like when she ordered pizza to my house because she knows I don’t like cheese. ‘I’m now planning my visit to Tennessee to go and visit Di and Doug. I can’t wait - we both finally have the family we always wanted.’ The siblings had been 4,000 miles apart and were only united after Mrs Messer looked into her family tree and contacted Mr Haydon. Mr Haydon had contacted countless family history websites over the years but struggled to put the pieces of the mystery together after his mother vanished. Two years ago he began saving for an iPad, in order to be able to make his own Facebook account. Just four weeks after Mr Haydon joined up to the social media site, he was contacted by Mrs Messer. Greeted: Mr Hayden and Mrs Masser were clearly delighted to meet each other for the first time, in Britain .

This was Eileen's nickname for Mr Haydon when he was a little boy . Mrs Messer said: ‘It was fate that John got his iPad when he did. After our mother passed away some years ago when she was 89, I began to look into her family tree. ‘I was unsuccessful for many years but eventually I came across a website and within hours I found out about my mother’s history - her maiden name was Eileen Pinches and she had two sons. 'I discovered one son had died, but then it hit me - I had a brother out there somewhere' Diane Messer . ‘I discovered one son had died, but then it hit me - I had a brother out there somewhere. ‘I wanted to make sure John was my brother before I told him the bombshell that I actually was his half-sister, so we began speaking on Facebook first. ‘When I told him the news there was no response at first and I thought he’d had a heart attack but he finally responded with the words - “love you”.’ Mr Haydon and Mrs Messer have since spoken every day through the video call app Facetime and sent each other family photos of their mother and exchanged stories. In the stocks: Mr Haydon said the siblings 'have a great relationship and already pull pranks on each other' Smiles: They had been 4,000 miles apart and were only united after Mrs Messer looked into her family tree .

However he discovered the heart-rending news that on her death bed, his mother had asked Mrs Messer to always look after and wear her fondest necklace which she named Spike. Eileen’s nickname for Mr Haydon when he was a little boy was Spike. Mr Haydon said: ‘It’s great to know she never forgot me and she always had a piece of me with her. Me and Diane have worked together to try and piece together her life. ‘She really was quite the traveller. We’ve lost two or three years - and have no idea where she was or what she did, which will always remain a mystery.'","John Haydon received message from a woman claiming to be his sister .

"By . Alun Rees . Petrol thieves have drilled into an underground pipeline and caused a leak of thousands of litres of fuel next to a popular fishing river, sparking a major environmental alert. About 150,000 litres of fuel have contaminated soil close to the River Kennet, just upstream from top public school Marlborough College in Wiltshire. Police are investigating the attack on the Esso refinery pipeline, believed to be the first of its kind in the UK. 150,000 litres of fuel have contaminated soil close to the River Kennet, pictured, in Wiltshire . A Wiltshire Police source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We’re used to fuel being stolen from farms by rural criminals but this is quite a step further. Two men have been detained in the Somerset area with a large amount of illicit fuel but at this stage we don’t know if the two incidents are linked.’ The theft was from the Midline pipeline, which carries fuel from the Fawley Refinery near Southampton to the Birmingham Fuels Terminal. Using a technique more common in Iraq, the thieves dug down about 8ft to get to the pipeline, then drilled a small hole in it. They connected a hose to the pipe which they ran to a road nearby and then covered with soil. After putting a tap on the end of the hose and covering their tracks, it is believed they returned at night to fill containers. The pipeline alternates between carrying petrol and diesel fuel. About 150,000 litres of fuel have contaminated soil close to the River Kennet, just upstream from top public school Marlborough College, pictured, in Wiltshire . But three weeks ago a plough tore the illicit hose from its shallow trench and ripped it out of the pipeline, causing the leak. John Hounslow, who operates a trout farm on the river, said: ‘The big fear is that this fuel will get into the river and destroy the food chain. It’s very worrying.’ Esso is leading the efforts to contain the spill and is drilling at the site to try to discover what is happening to the fuel beneath  the surface. However it is unclear whether it will be washed into the river or sink into the chalk below. A spokesman said: ‘It’s very unfortunate and technical work is going on to try to establish whether this will affect the water table and the river.’ Charlotte Hitchmough, spokeswoman for environmental group Action for the River Kennet, said: ‘It is worrying and we hope the river won’t be badly impacted but no one can predict where  the fuel will end up.’","150,000 litres of fuel contaminated soil close to River Kennet in Wiltshire .

Sunday was the first Mother's Day when Colette Brasseur didn't have to worry about the baby girl she'd given away in 1991, aged 24. And it was the first time Natalie Bader could thank the woman who brought her into the world. Bader had a happy childhood with her adoptive parents Rosie and Don Bader but she always wanted to find her biological mother when the time felt right. Reconnected: Sunday was the first Mother's Day when Colette Brasseur, left, and Natalie Bader, right, were in contact . In December, she typed Brasseur's name . into Facebook and within a quarter of an hour she'd located the . 47-year-old, who had relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, and her son . Payton, 21. She sent them both friend requests. 'Ironically, my first thought was that she looks familiar - I must know her parents,' Brasseur recalled to Today.com. She didn't accept the friend request, however Payton, who didn't know he had an older sister at the time, did. He told his mom that Bader claimed they were siblings, which is when Brasseur finally revealed the two decade-old secret she'd kept from him. Adoption: In 1991, Brasseur enlisted in the Army but soon discovered she was pregnant. However, she couldn't afford to raise the child, pictured with her bottom left . In 1991, Brasseur enlisted in the Army but soon discovered she was pregnant. However, she had signed up because she was financially struggling so she knew she couldn't afford to raise her child. An open adoption seemed like the best option. She recalls having an immediate connection with the Baders. Close: Bader, pictured, and her mom now speak everyday and Brasseur praises Facebook for helping her catch up on all the years she missed out on . 'To this day I can remember thinking that she was as sweet as pie and he reminded me of Santa Claus - he was just real jolly and always laughing,' Brasseur told Today.com. 'And I thought there was something special about these two people. And thank God I was right.' She kept in touch with the family for four years however, the relationship dropped off after the adoption agency closed, leaving Brasseur wondering if she'd ever see her daughter again. The mother and daughter now speak everyday and Brasseur praises Facebook for helping her catch up on all the years she missed out on. 'Graduation and birthdays and holidays, because of the timeline, I was there,' she said. 'All the pictures that I didn't get from the [adoption] agency that I was promised, I got from Facebook. The two still haven't met in person, due to the distance and cost of a flight. But, despite that, this year's Mother's Day still holds a special significance because it's their first together. 'What Mother's Day means is that it'll be my first Mother's Day that I don't have to worry,' Brassuer said. 'When you give up a child or adoption, her life with [her adoptive parents] starts. But her life with me never stopped. Every time I saw a child around her age, I thought it could be her.' 'For years it was question after question after question, and I couldn't get answers,' she added.

"By . Joe Bernstein . England midfielder Adam Lallana will celebrate his call-up into Roy Hodgson’s World Cup squad by sealing a £20million move to Liverpool this week. It is a massive boost for Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, whose side have an outside chance of winning their first title since 1990 when the Premier League season reaches its climax on Sunday. Lallana celebrated his 26th birthday on Saturday by choosing to join the Rodgers revolution at Anfield despite interest from other clubs. On the move: Adam Lallana is hoping to seal a £20m move to Liverpool as early as next week . Southampton believe the fee represents fair value for a player who progressed through their respected youth academy, and all sides see sense in wrapping up the move before the England players report for manager Hodgson’s pre-World Cup training camp in Portugal on May 19. Hodgson names his 23-man squad plus seven standby players for Brazil on Monday and Lallana is certain to be included. Liverpool will hope Lallana’s imminent arrival is a lucky omen as they face Newcastle at Anfield on Sunday afternoon - two points behind leaders Manchester City, who face West Ham at The Etihad. Man with the plan: Brendan Rodgers (right) is preparing to launch a spending spree this summer . In: Lallana looks a certainty for Roy Hodgson's 2014 World Cup squad which is selected on Monday . Due to City’s superior goal difference, Manuel Pellegrini’s side need only a draw to be champions for the second time in three seasons. Liverpool would finish top if they won and City lost. Regardless of the outcome of the title race, the signing of Lallana marks the start of a bold summer of spending by Rodgers to ensure his team are strong enough to compete in both the Premier League and Champions League next season. Owner John W Henry has promised Rodgers, who will be delighted to land Lallana so early, £60m plus any money he makes on sales. Talent: Lallana could be lining up alongside Luis Suarez (left) and Daniel Sturridge next season . Spend: Rodgers claims Liverpool have got to do everything they can to stay in the top four for the foreseeable future . Rodgers said about his planned revamp: ‘Teams have spent the money trying to get into the top four and can’t get in. For us now, we’re in it. Now we’ve got to do everything we can to stay in.’ Lallana’s departure from Southampton is likely to be followed by manager Mauricio Pochettino, who is wanted by Spurs. Teenage defender Luke Shaw, who also has an outside chance of being in England’s World Cup party, is being hotly pursued by Manchester United and Chelsea and will seek talks about his future after his club’s final game of the season today, against Manchester United.

Valarie's Watts is still mourning the death of her son Noah, after giving birth to the stillborn baby boy last July. But a kind act from a perfect stranger is helping the Cokato, Minnesota mom deal with her boy's passing. Scroll down for video . Tragic loss: Valarie Watts (left) lost her son Noah at birth last July. The boy was born stillborn after his umbilical cord became pinched in the womb . Ms Watts says she first noticed something was wrong with her pregnancy a few weeks before her due date, when she stopped feeling Noah kick. 'All week I knew,' she told KMSP. 'He wasn't moving as much. I was very nervous.' She later learned that the umbilical cord had become pinched in the womb, and by the time she went into labor it was too late. Overcome by Noah's loss, Ms Watts refused to part with the crib she had assembled for her baby boy until an older couple took interest in it at her family's garage sale last month. Craftsman Gerald Kumpula turns second-hand furniture into benches, and saw the crib as his next project.

When she heard about Mr Kumpula's projects, Ms Watts said she hesitated to sell the crib, which wasn't originally a part of the sale. But she ended up giving the crib to him anyway. At the time, Kumpula didn't know the significance the crib held to the woman. It was only in the car ride home with his wife that he heard Ms Watts' stragic story. 'His wife was was there looking through my garage sale - at some of the baby clothes - and asked how old my son was since I don't use the crib anymore, and I told her that he had passed in July,' Ms Watts said. No idea: When he purchased the crib, Mr Kumpula didn't know about Ms Watts' tragic loss. But his wife, who spoke with Watts at the garage sale, told him about the stillborn baby on the car ride home from the sale. He decided to turn the crib into a bench and return it to the mother .

The craftsman decided then and there that the crib would be returned to Ms Watts - but in a different form. About a week later Mr Kumpula brought the crib back to Ms Watts house, having turned it into a large chair. Ms Watts says she immediately started crying when she saw her son's crib turned into something beautiful by a complete stranger. 'It's amazing, and there's good people out there.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Britain loves nudity - and it is thanks to Queen Victoria, an artist has declared. Notoriously stern, the 19th century monarch is often portrayed as a solemn and repressed widow. But she was in fact an open-minded woman passionate about the naked form, according to photographer of nudes Spencer Tunick. Freedom: Spencer Tunick has been arrested five times in New York for his installations but he can work in Britain (Gateshead, pictured) 'thanks to Queen Victoria' Expression: Tunick, from New Jersey, is known for his large-scale photography projects with naked volunteers in open spaces, such as Munich's Odeon Hall (pictured) Open-minded: Queen Victoria is often portrayed as repressed, but in fact she had a passion for naked flesh, Spencer Tunick (right) claims . Tunick has been arrested five times for his large-scale installations in the US. However, basking in Queen Victoria's legacy, the American can explore his controversial projects in the UK free from fear. 'I think there was such a strong love for the nude in art by Queen Victoria that it sort of set your midset towards body and art,' he told The Times. 'It survived and is flourishing today.' 'She had a passion for nudity.' Queen Victoria commissioned numerous nude paintings over her -year reign, lauding them as 'beautiful'. Commissions: She ordered Scottish painter William Dyce to create Neptune Resigning To Britannia The Empire Of the Sea - a large fresco of the Roman god playing naked with a gaggle of nude nymphs. At the time, Dyce wrote that Prince Albert 'thought it rather nude' but the queen had no issue with it . She ordered Scottish painter William Dyce to create a large painting of the Roman god Neptune playing naked with a gaggle of nude nymphs. At the time, Dyce wrote: 'Prince thought it rather nude; the Queen, however, said not at all.' Despite their differing opinions on the exposure of flesh, Victoria maintained her stance. She gave Albert at least three heavily nude paintings as birthday presents. Historians have also found hints of the queen's penchant for naked flesh in her diaries. She referred to a statue of Prince Albert with bare feet and a short kilt as 'very beautiful' - although her beloved husband later had the statue remodelled to be less exposed. Vying for his attention: Exhibitionists in Hastings hold a flash mob on a wet and windy beach this January calling for Tunick to come to photograph them . The Hastings hopefuls lost out to Folkestone, Kent, where Tunick will hold a three-day exhibition of photographs from May 15 . Almost two centuries later, British exhibitionists across the country compete for Tunick's attention. Last month, dozens of people gathered on a wet and windy Hastings beach in an impromptu flash mob to inspire the New Jersey-based artist. Brighton residents also made a bid for the chance to host the controversial photographer, but lost out to Georges House Gallery in Folkestone, Kent. Preparing for one of his photoshoots, which will be featured in this month's Museums At Night Festival, Tunick said this enthusiasm is a clear mark of Victoria's legacy. His collection of images, featuring 250 volunteers in Folkestone, will go on display as a chain of viewfinders in the gallery from May 15.","Controversial photographer of nudes Spencer Tunick arrested five times in the US but never in Britain .

"By . Sam Webb . A 16-year-old was today being held on suspicion of attempted murder after three people were shot in woodland close to family homes last night. The three men are being treated for gunshot wounds, while another two suffered unknown injuries. Police were scrambled to the woodland after a volley of shots rang out in the trees behind houses in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. A father today told how his teenage son had been arrested over the shooting. Gunfire: This house was cordoned off as part of the investigation into the shooting of three men in High Wycombe yesterday. A teenager, 16, is being held on suspicion of attempted murder . Police talks to locals in the aftermath of the attack in the quiet residential area of High Wycombe . 'They arrested him in the road,' said the man. They (police) kicked us out of our house and are searching it.' He . said his wife and other children were staying with family nearby while . forensic officers searched their small semi-detached home. 'At the moment all I know is my son has been arrested, I don't know about anyone else,' he said. He . added that police had said he may be able to return to his home, where . he has lived for 14 years, after 7pm this evening, but declined to . comment further. The teenager was being held in the police cells while he awaits questioning by senior detectives. Shocked residents have told how they feared for their childrens’ safety after hearing gunfire during last night's attack. One neighbour, aged 20, who asked not to be named, said: 'It started out on Underwood Road at about 6pm, I saw a couple of cars and someone came out from the footpath to the woods with a gashed head. 'Then at about 8.20pm I heard two gunshots. A couple of minutes later another went off out the back. 'I looked out to the woods and park and saw a couple of guys and some other people’s heads over the fence. They were Asian lads, in their late teens or early 20s.' The woman, a mother of one, said she feared for the safety of her young child. 'It was scary seeing the police with guns and dogs, I have never seen anything like that before,' she said. 'The children in the street were petrified, they didn’t know what was going on.' Police are also hunting for a number of 'outstanding' offenders. Eight police cars and a van were parked in the residential street, where the footpath through to the woods had been cordoned off as forensics officers in white suits searched the area. Blood was found at several locations and multiple areas were cordoned off by officers for forensic experts to examine. An address was also being examined as two police stood guard. A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said officers were called to the disturbance, which is not thought to be a random attack.

'Uniformed officers and forensic teams are deployed at a number of scenes at this time.' Some locals reported that they heard the two men who were not injured by gunfire were stabbed, although this has not been confirmed. The investigation was being lead by the Force Criminal Investigations Department, supported by specialist teams and local uniformed officers and PCSOs. Superintendent Ed McLean said: 'We are in the early stage of a complex investigation and I would like to reassure the community of High Wycombe that we are actively seeking to arrest outstanding offenders. 'It is important to note that this is not believed to be a random shooting.'

After waiting a while, the pair crossed to get a photograph of the man who is accused of embezzling funds from the AWU for personal purposes - including to buy a house in Melbourne. 'I was a few metres back when Sam was firing off a few shots of him (Wilson)' Himbrechts said. Come here, boy! Bruce Wilson attacks photographer Sam Mooy outside a Sydney hearing today. an inquiry is being held into allegations of corruption at the union he was once the boss of . 'I waited for him to turn around, but he just lunged and attacked Sam making contact with his lens and face.' 'It was over very quickly.' Mr Himbrechts said he thought heard an expletive come from Wilson's mouth, but couldn't be sure. Mr Wilson wasn't even due to appear at day one of the hearing into allegations of AWU corruption, which is investigating allegations that a slush-fund was set up to pay kick-backs to union members. It was a scandal which dogged much of Ms Gillard's reign as Prime Minister, because she was Mr Wilson's partner when the allegations took place more than 20 years ago. Ms Gillard was also working for law firm Slater and Gordon at the time of the alleged rort of funds, and she provided her partner with pro-bono legal services for the establishment of the fund which paid for a Fitzroy property. Police are aware of the incident but a spokesman said no one has come forward with a formal complaint. The spokesman said: 'Sydney city (command) are aware of the incident, but no complaint has been forwarded.'

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . Bernie Ecclestone has again proved himself the great survivor by maintaining the support of the one person who can save him from the sack – publicity-shy businessman Donald Mackenzie. Sportsmail understands that Mackenzie, the chairman of CVC, the private equity firm which owns the largest shareholding in Formula One, has withstood pressure from within the board to remove Ecclestone after he was called 'untruthful and corrupt' by a judge last week. Although Mackenzie, 57, rarely speaks to reporters and declined to offer public backing for Ecclestone, unimpeachable sources have revealed that he remains loyal for two principal reasons. Staying put: Bernie Ecclestone, pictured in London last week, is poised to remain at the helm of Formula One . The first is that Ecclestone, with his flair and experience, makes the business more money than anyone else possibly could, and the second that there is nobody lined up to take over. Therefore, Ecclestone will stay in post as Formula One's chief executive – and all-seeing impresario – unless he is found guilty of bribery in a criminal court case in Munich this April. However, given that Ecclestone is 83, a replacement must be found some time soon. One board member told Sportsmail that the only plausible contender is Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal, who was named by Ecclestone as his preferred successor last November. Looking ahead: Christian Horner is seen as the only plausible contender to replace the 83-year-old . The two men are close, often dining together. Horner was one of only a handful of guests at Ecclestone's 2012 marriage to Brazilian Fabiana Flosi. But as well as being a confidant of Ecclestone, Horner is respected within the paddock for the astute manner in which he has harnessed Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz's fortune to win eight titles, drivers' and constructors', in four seasons. One well-placed source said: 'There is no doubt Christian fits the bill. Bernie is unique and no one can do what he has been doing. Simple as that. We need someone with experience of Formula One, someone who can deal with television rights and commercial contracts. The fact that Bernie would train Christian up, in effect, looks like a solution to many of the directors.' Surviving the axe: Ecclestone, pictured here earlier this year, faces trial in a Munich court in April . Ecclestone, who stores every contract in his office, and all the know-how in his head, holds a strong hand with regards to who replaces him and when. Imposing some corporate type on him would not work. Justin King, the former Sainsbury's chief executive, whose son Jordan is pursuing a career in motor racing, was interviewed by Mackenzie but has been categorically discounted as a possible replacement. Sportsmail understands that, Horner apart, none of the handful of names linked with Ecclestone's position is remotely under consideration. So it seems likely that only a jail sentence in Munich, where Ecclestone is accused of bribing German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky to sell the sport to CVC at an undervalued price, will unseat the octogenarian billionaire in the immediate future. Moving on: Horner has steered Red Bull to eight titles, drivers' and constructors', in four seasons . For as well as strong support from Mackenzie, Ecclestone has the backing of the Peter Brabeck-Lethmathe, chairman of Delta Topco, the F1 board that comprises CVC and the other shareholders. It is understood that Brabeck-Lethmathe was won over by Ecclestone's 'genius' in building palaces out of sand – namely, taking the sport to new venues, such as Bahrain and Abu Dhabi – and making huge profits in the process. However, there remains a chance that Mackenzie could be swayed into acting sooner if the sport's other investors, including Waddell and Reed, an American investment company who hold a 20.9 per cent stake, the US-based financial firm BlackRock, and Norges Bank, who control the Norwegian government's pension fund, started to fret about Ecclestone's probity. Mercedes and Ferrari, who also sit on the board, are known to be exercised about the need for good corporate governance, citing the European compliance law, which acts as a kind of fit-and-proper-person test. In the spotlight: Luca di Montezemolo is likely to oppose Horner taking over from Ecclestone . Ferrari, represented by their president and one of Formula One's big beasts Luca di Montezemolo, have publicly called for a summit to plan a future for the sport in the post-Ecclestone. Di Montezemolo has not been antagonistic towards Ecclestone in his pronouncements, but is likely to speak out against Horner taking over on the basis that he hails from a rival team. Ecclestone is still stung by the findings of Mr Justice Newey last week. Despite ruling against Constantin Medien, a German media firm and former shareholders in F1 who believe they lost out because Ecclestone bribed Gribkowsky to sell the sport for less than its market value, Newey said Ecclestone had lied in evidence. 'Tell me where I lied,' said Ecclestone yesterday. 'I can't see where the evidence is for that.' 52594 . 36950 . 84359 . 201039 . 55125 . 32857 .","Bernie Ecclestone to remain in post as Formula One chief executive unless he is found guilty of bribery at Criminal Court in Munich in April .

"By . Daniel Mills . Australians face a daunting 36-hours ahead of Tuesday's Federal Budget with 16,000 jobs set to be slashed and the Royal Australian Mint sold. About 76 government run agencies will be either sold, consolidated or scrapped. The Australian Newspaper today reported about 31 smaller agencies will go, 11 will be merged and nine bigger departments will fold completely. 'A more prosperous Australia' Treasurer Joe Hockey has declared Tuesday's budget will benefit all Australians in the long run, despite short-term pain . Five departments, including the Royal Australian Mint, will be sold-off. The initial forecasted job cuts of 12,000 has since been revised and it looks as if that number will be closer to 16,000. Treasurer Joe Hockey has assured Australians it is all part of a cost-savings measure to help get the budget back into the black by 2024. Mr Hockey said: 'It is a budget that asks the Australian people to contribute to a stronger Australian economy, a more prosperous Australia with more jobs and a greater sense of security,' Savings of more than $470 million will be made by the winding back, sale and scrapping of jobs and government agencies. The Royal Australian Mint (pictured) will be sold, as will a number of key government agencies in a bid to get Australia's budget back in to surplus by 2024 . If it goes through, the sale of the  Defence Housing Australia would raise $1 billion and other assets, including the mint, would provide millions more. Economists are tipping this to be the toughest budget ever released - certainly the toughest since the first under former Prime Minister John Howard in 1996. Separate studies and audits have recommended sweeping changes, including the Commission Of Audit, which recommended across-the-board reforms. Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said all workers will need to brace themselves for the changes ahead. 'This is not a matter of targeting one area of government more than another.' 'We are very systematic and very methodical in going right across government.' His department undertook a separate study last year which identified about 937 bodies and 'governance relationships', such as committees, that were under government control. This is despite the majority of workers being employed in only about 100 of government agencies. Treasurer Hockey has therefore made a commitment to winding back the public service and putting the government's efforts into improving its most important sectors. 'You can have lots of small programs that involve a massive amount of red tape with very little outcome,' Mr Hockey said. 'What we’ve got to do is refocus the energy of the public sector in Canberra.' Australian unions have gone on the front foot in support of public sector workers. The Community and Public Service Union conducted a poll of more than 5820 staff from fifty different Commonwealth agencies recently, regarding government worker cuts. It revealed 70 per cent of respondents reported job cuts in their workplace over the past year while 87 per cent reported understaffing and unfilled positions. CPSU National Secretary Nadine Flood said the survey shows the damage being done to public services and highlights the risks if the government continues to pursue cuts.  'The very clear message we are getting from workers at the coalface is that ongoing cuts are putting the public service under unsustainable pressure,' she said.'The Government can pretend it can make cuts without hurting services, but this survey shows that is simply not true.' ACTU President Ged Kearney said: 'It’s not in Australia’s interest to implement savage cuts to health, education, pensions, welfare and public sector jobs, while at the same time dropping the baton on training, investment and vital job creation.' Mr Kearney said everything he has heard ahead of tomorrow's announcement spells disaster for hard working Australians. 'They’re (Australians) worried their kids won’t be able to go to university and about vanishing job and training opportunities for young people.' 'Everything coming from the Abbott Government so far indicates that budget 2014 will make it harder for Australian families and workers to make ends meet.' The budget will be released at 7.30pm Tuesday.","Major Australian assets will be sold, including the Royal Australian Mint and Defence Housing Australia .

"By . Kate Lyons . Luke Hunt, the fiancé of Indigenous model Samantha Harris could face up to ten years in jail for causing the death of an elderly man after he ran a red light at 40 km/h over the speed limit, a court heard. The 28-year-old is currently facing a sentencing hearing for the incident, which occurred two years ago when he and Ms Harris, 23, were driving to the gym in Narweena in Sydney's northern suburbs. The Commodore he was driving collided with a Hyundai Lantra driven by Kennth Lay, 78, at the  intersection of Alred St and Warringah Rd. Luke Hunt is facing a maximum 10-year jail term for dangerous driving, which occasioned Kenneth Lay's death. He is pictured with his fiancee, model Samantha Harris . The beauty has been modeling since she was discovered in a competition held by Girlfriend magazine when she was 13-years-old . Mr Lay, who had 16 grandchildren, later died in hospital from injuries sustained during the collision. Hunt, a builder from Queensland, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving saying he ran a red or orange light. He claims he was travelling at 94 km/h in a 60 km/h zone. However, the crown told the court  he was driving at 101 to 105 km/h. The question of the speed at which Hunt was travelling needs to be resolved before the judge sentences Hunt later today, though he faces a maximum of 10 years in prison. Hunt was driving at least 30 km/h over the speed limit and ran a red or amber light at an intersection when his car collided with the car driven by Mr Lay . The model is engaged to her boyfriend of six years, who's a builder from Queensland . Harris was a passenger in the car during the accident in Narraweena . The Daily Telegraph reported the judge told the court 'there are no winners in this case' as the families of both Mr Lay and Hunt, including Mr Lay's emotional daughter Christine Scott, filled the court room, sitting on opposite sides. Ms Harris was not present at Sydney's District Court for the sentencing hearing. Hunt and Ms Harris, who shot to national fame in a modelling competition held by Girlfriend magazine when she was 14, met in a shopping centre on the Gold Coast when the model was 17. They have been engaged for four years. The collision took place at the intersection of Warringah Rd and Alfred St in Narweena, in Sydney's northern suburbs, two years ago. Mr Lay, who had 16 grandchildren, was taken to hospital where he later died from injuries sustained in the crash .

"By . Joel Christie . A 20-year-old Michigan man who shot dead a cop who caught him driving on a suspended license left a trail of mysterious letters before hanging himself in his prison cell last month. Eric John Knysz was just one week into serving a life sentence for the first-degree murder of Michigan State Police Trooper Paul K. Butterfield II when he was found hanging by a braided bed sheet with a white towel over his eyes on April 14. Michigan State Police investigative reports, obtained by MLive Muskegon Chronicle, show the killer left notes asking for God's forgiveness, expressing a need to 'get out of here now' and stating his life was over at 20 while telling someone 'yours doesn’t have to be'. Knysz confessed to shooting 43-year-old Butterfield in the head on September 9, 2013, at a traffic stop on a rural Mason County road out of ear of going to prison. Cryptic: Eric Knysz left behind a series of mysterious notes before hanging himself in a Michigan prison last month. He was one week into a life sentence for killing a police officer .

Slain: Trooper Paul Butterfield II was shot dead by Eric Knysz during a routine traffic stop in September . He was driving on a suspended license and had stolen guns concealed in his pickup truck. Investigators . say Knysz didn't leave a 'true suicide note' but several handwritten . letters that show he was contemplating taking his own life. Knysz had written on his bed: 'I hope you can forgive me Lord.' He . had also written on paper: 'My life is over at just 20. Yours doesn’t . have to be. Stop f---in around an start a family an stop breaking the . law.' The report doesn’t . indicate whom the note was addressed to, but Knysz’s wife, 21-year-old . Sarah Renee Knysz, is serving a prison sentence of two to five years for . helping her husband flee after the shooting. On December 25, 2013, she gave birth to their son, who is believed to have been placed in the care of family while she returned to prison. On . the back of a sheet of 8 ½” by 11” paper containing information for . incoming prisoners were numerous short, handwritten notes including: . 'Father if you accept my decision I will be with you tommrow evening. I . (hope?) and prey that you do and have mercy on my soul.' On . another sheet of paper titled 'Health care request', Knysz had written . under problem or symptom: 'I need to get out of here now.' Knysz . was sentenced April 8 to life in prison without chance of parole - just . six days before his suicide - following an emotionally-charged trial. As well as first degree murder, Knysz was . also found guilty of vehicle theft, carrying a concealed weapon, felony . firearm and being an habitual offender. Speaking at Knysz’s sentencing hearing, Butterfield’s fiancee, Jennifer Sielski said: 'I felt like . the luckiest woman in the world just to be a part of Paul’s life... He was . my friend, my inspiration, my hero, my soulmate.' Cop killer: Eric Knysz was just 19 when he murdered Michigan State Police Trooper Paul K. Butterfield II and was sentenced to life without parole .

Paul Butterfield's father (left) spoke at the sentencing. He addressed Knysz directly, comparing his murdered son's many achievements by the age of 19 with the little Eric Knysz has accomplished . Mr Butterfield's father also spoke at the sentencing, addressing Knysz directly. 'At the age of 19 years old you have . effectively ended the life of freedom for yourself... At 19, Paul was a . high school graduate, a state class A cross-country champion and . enrolled at the University of Tennessee for track and country. He ran . marathons world-wide and participated in several triathalons… what have . you accomplished by the age of 19?' he said. 'I . do not know if you’re planning on giving a statement to the court but . if you say how sorry you are for what happened it’ll be for one reason . and one reason only and as that is you got caught,' Mr Butterfield added. During sentencing Knysz did apologize to the Butterfield family 'for everything I’ve done and the pain I’ve put them through'. 'I’m sorry, I never meant to take the life of your son. I never meant for any of this to happen,' he added. In his closing arguments during the trial, defense . attorney David Glancy noted that the only witness who could place Knysz . in the pickup that day was his wife, Sarah, who testified against him.

"By . Emily Crane . A man accused of murdering five members of his wife's family allegedly planned to have a dead man's DNA stolen from a funeral home and planted on the murder weapon in what he referred to as his 'Plan B'. Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie, who stands accused of murdering the Lin family, had various conversations with a fellow inmate about the killings and allegedly revealed he had bought the hammer used in the attack from a 'two-dollar shop' because he knew the store's security cameras were fake. The Crown told the court that the inmate, known as 'Witness A', had spoken of the plot, saying Xie had hoped to use a corrupt police officer - a friend of Witness A - to carry out the plan, but who was actually an undercover detective. Mr Xie has pleaded not guilty to murdering his brother-in-law Min 'Norman' Lin, 45, Mr Lin's wife, Yun 'Lily' Li Lin, 44, and their sons Henry, 12, and Terry, 9, in their Sydney home in July 2009. Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie, pictured outside court on Friday, is accused of murdering five members of his wife's family in their Sydney home in July 2009 . July 18, 2009: Min 'Norman' Lin, his wife, Yun 'Lily' Li Lin, his sister, Yun Bin 'Irene' Yin, and their two sons Henry, 12, and Terry, 9, were found bludgeoned to death in their North Epping home . The Lin's teenage daughter, Brenda, 15, was overseas on a school excursion. She was the only family member to survive . May 5, 2011: Police arrest Robert Xie at his North Epping home and charge him with five counts of murder . He and his wife Kathy Lin had been taking care of Brenda after her parents were killed . December 19, 2012: Robert Xie is committed to stand trial in the NSW Supreme Court . February 1, 2013: He pleads not guilty in the Supreme Court to five counts of murder . May 9, 2014: Murder trial begins in Sydney with Crown Prosecutor Mark Tedeschi's opening address . The 50-year-old is also alleged to have killed Lily's 39-year-old sister, Yun Bin 'Irene' Yin. Mr Xie's inmate, who gained his trust when they were in neighbouring cells in Long Bay prison, has said the accused was convinced Lily had had an affair with a man named Rob, and claimed Mr Xie said he'd seen a mobile phone and the victim's diary, both of which proved her 'willingness to leave her family', reports The Daily Telegraph . In the opening address of Mr Xie's murder trial on Monday, Crown Prosecutor Mark Tedeschi said the inmate had 21 conversations with Mr Xie over an 18-month span from July 2011. 'He had a number of conversations about the hammer in which it was implicit that he knew where it was disposed of or hidden and that it could be obtained by someone on the outside,' Mr Tedeschi told the court. Mr Xie is also alleged to have told the inmate that he had martial arts training and 'demonstrated on Witness A a pressure point in the neck which meant he could easily incapacitate his victims.' The court heard that the Lin family were killed by both blunt force trauma and asphyxiation in the bedrooms of their North Epping home on July 18, 2009. The inmate reported his conversations to police and will receive a reduced prison sentence for testifying against Mr Xie. The court was also told a smear of blood found in Mr Xie's garage had been proven to belong to Terry Lin with such certainty that there was only a 'one in 50 quadrillion chance' of it belonging to another person. The trial continues. Min 'Norman' Lin, 45, Mr Lin's wife, Yun 'Lily' Li Lin, 44, and their sons Henry, 12, and Terry, 9, were killed in their Epping home.

"By . Sarah Michael . The Block apartment designed by this year's contestants, sisters Alisa and Lysandra, has been seized by federal police as possible proceeds of crime. The twins' luxury unit was purchased by Lukas James Kamay, a NAB banker charged with carrying out an alleged insider trading scam worth $7 million. The 26-year-old successfully bid $2.375 million for the three bedroom inner-Melbourne apartment in April, $616,000 above its reserve price. Scroll down for video . The Block's Alisa and Lysandra (pictured on the night of the reality TV show's auction) have had the apartment they designed seized by police after it was bought by a young banker accused of a $7 million insider trading scam . Lukas Kamay (left), a 26-year-old NAB employee, bought The Block twins' unit for $2.375 million with the proceeds from his trades. Kamay is pictured (right) leaving the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Friday after he was charged with insider trading . The Australian Federal Police and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission have frozen the $500,000 deposit he put down for the 47 O'Grady Street property, among other assets, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. The MailOnline understands Alisa and Lysandra will still receive their winnings. Kamay and Christopher Russell Hill – an employee of the Australian Bureau of Statistics – are friends from Monash University and are accused of making net profit of $6.98 million over eight months by insider trading using advanced knowledge of government data. Hill, a 24-year-old Canberra-based ABS employee, allegedly gave Kamay information about official data releases on jobs, building approvals, capital expenditure and retail sales. Kamay allegedly offered Hill $50,000 to give him the ABS data and would use this information to 'predict fluctuations in the Australian dollar'. Christopher Hill, a 24-year-old ABS employee accused of feeding Kamay data, is seen being escorted by police to a plane at Canberra Airport on Saturday . Hill was arrested for offences relating to insider trading and extradited to Victoria . He would buy foreign exchange derivative contracts minutes before the ABS's data release at 11.30am and would sell them shortly afterwards. The men were arrested on Friday and charged with offences relating to insider trading, money laundering, corruption and abuse of public office. Kamay and Hill's alleged scam first caught the attention of Owen Kerr, a foreign exchange broker who works at online currency trading firm Pepperstone Financial, where Kamay was a client. In September last year one of Mr Kerr's employees noticed their client Kamay was making large bets on the Australian dollar moments before ABS data releases at 11.30am. Mr Kerr searched for Kamay using his gold LinkedIn account and saw that he was connected to ABS employee Hill, The Australian Financial Review reported. Mr Kerr then realised Kamay was using a 'man on the inside' to trade on ABS data. Alisa and Lysandra's apartment was bought for $616,000 above its reserve price . His tip off lead to a joint AFP and ASIC surveillance operation called Operation Leith, which was carried out with the cooperation of Pepperstone, the ABS, NAB and Kamay's second broker Axicorp. 'Kamay was taking quite decent size positions which were larger than his account size could sustain if they went the wrong way, so they were really an all or nothing bet and not something someone would normally rationally make,' Mr Kerr said. 'He would trade just before the announcements. The earliest they would get in was half an hour but mostly three to five minutes or sometimes even 30 seconds.' NAB and the ABS monitored Kamay and Hill at work, tapping their phones and taping them using surveillance video. Early on Friday, the AFP and ASIC executed eight search warrants at both of the men's properties and arrested the pair in the process. The $500,000 deposit Kamay paid to buy the apartment (pictured) has been frozen by police . Alisa and Lysandra came second on the reality TV show thanks to the $2.375 million bid . Included in the items seized was $9,000 in cash. Kamay, based in Clifton Hill, was charged with offences relating to corrupting a public official and using inside information to unlawfully profit from positive foreign exchange derivatives. Meanwhile Hill, based in Belconnen, was charged with abuse of public office, releasing sensitive information, receiving a corrupt benefit and insider trading. ‘The AFP and ASIC have worked together closely on this serious and complex investigation, utilising the resources and expertise of both agencies to bring about today's arrests,’ AFP Acting National Manager Crime Operations Ian McCartney said. ‘Investigations like this send a clear message to anyone who is thinking of engaging in this type of criminal activity - we have the ability to monitor you and take action, as we've done today.’ The luxury apartment is located in Albert Park in inner-city Melbourne . 'The outcome of today's operation is a testament to the close working relationship and cooperation between the AFP and ASIC, and the dedication and expertise of the teams involved,' ASIC head of markets enforcement Chris Savundra said. The National Australia Bank and Australian Bureau of Statistics fully cooperated with the investigation. When phoned for comment, a spokesperson for the Australian Federal Police said no further charges would be brought against the pair. The men, who were university friends, are fronted court in Melbourne and Canberra on Friday. A producer for The Block told MailOnline they could not comment as the matter is before the courts.

"By . Ted Thornhill . A warring Chicago couple due to appear on the Maury show never got the chance to air their grievances on TV – because they were jailed the night before after allegedly fighting each other in their hotel. John Coley, 46, and Shantae McGhee-Brown, 25, were supposed to be booked into separate hotels, but the show’s producer made the mistake of booking them both into the DoubleTree in Norwalk, Connecticut.

Bitter dispute: John Cole (left) and Shantae McGhee-Brown (right) were due to appear on the Maury show, but were jailed the night before after they fought each other at their hotel . However, the pair bumped into each other in the hotel the night before the taping was due to take place and they both lost their temper. Police were called to deal with the disturbance and found McGhee-Brown in hallway dressed only in a towel, according to The Hour. She told officers that during the course of the brawl with Cole, she had thrown a vase and broken a table. Veteran TV personality: Maury Povich on the set of his syndicated talk show, Maury, which is filmed in Stamford, Connecticut . They were both charged with disorderly conduct and criminal mischief after the incident last month, with McGhee-Brown also charged with interfering with police. The pair were held in custody overnight and missed the show. Maury Povich’s staple diet is talking to guests with drinking problems, serial cheaters and disputes over parent identities.

"By . Dan Bloom . He is used to getting laughs as the quintessentially British Blackadder, Mr Bean and Johnny English - but now Rowan Atkinson could play a dour French detective. The 59-year-old comic has reportedly been lined up to play Jules Maigret, the popular pipe-smoking police inspector dubbed the Sherlock Holmes of France. The fictional character last featured in a 12-part ITV series 21 years ago starring Michael Gambon, and the channel is hoping to revive the story again, it was reported. Comic: Rowan Atkinson famously played Blackadder, Johnny English and Mr Bean (pictured), but the 59-year-old's next role is as the dour French detective Jules Maigret, according to a newspaper report . Screen icon: Maigret was portrayed by actors including Richard Harris in 1988 (left) and Jean Richard in 1984 . The claims, made today in the Sunday Express, come a year after Mr Atkinson won praise in his first non-musical West End performance for 25 years. He starred in Quartermaine’s Terms, a touching 1982 tragicomedy following the bittersweet lives of seven language teachers. An unnamed executive told the newspaper ITV was attempting to capitalise on the success of Scandinavian crime dramas such as The Killing and The Bridge, which has been adapted into a British version called The Tunnel. The executive said: 'The Maigret stories feel perfectly suited to television's continuing obsession with atmospheric foreign crime'. Jules Maigret was coined by the celebrated Belgian writer Georges Simenon, who wrote 75 novels about the fictional Parisien detective over a 40-year period from 1931. Hard act to follow: Michael Gambon as Maigret in 1992 (left) will reportedly be reprised by Rowan Atkinson . His trademark pipe, fondness of fine alcohol and reliance on godlike intuition led him to be compared to Sherlock Holmes, created by Arthur Conan Doyle almost 50 years earlier. Both had their sidekicks and nemeses, but while Holmes was known for his wit and charm, Maigret was famed for his serious devotion to each case. Maigret has been a TV hit as far afield as Japan and Russia, and the character's greatest success in Britain came when he was played by Rupert Davies in a long-running 1960s series on the BBC. ITV's recreation in 1992 and 1993 was always going to be difficult - as Simenon himself, who died in 1989, had personally approved Rupert Davies to play the role on the BBC. An ITV spokesman today said she was unable to confirm or deny the reports. Mr Atkinson's agent did not immediately return requests for comment.","Actor is known for comic roles in Blackadder, Mr Bean and Johnny English .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Michigan school teacher who took a video showing an autistic student with his head stuck in a classroom chair is to keep her job, but will be suspended for a year without pay. Nicole McVey reached for her cell phone . when the 11-year-old boy, who has Asperger's syndrome, became caught . through a chair at Oaktree Elementary School in Goodrich. The video was recorded last November and was released to a TV station in February. In it, the boy is shown with his head and arms stuck in an opening in the back of the chair. Scroll down for video... Distressed: A video recorded by a teacher shows a student with Asperger's syndrome mocking a boy, 11, who had become stuck in a chair while the head teacher chimes in. They then sent the video to other staff . A lawyer for the parents of the boy says they feel compelled to bring a lawsuit in the case. Patrick Greenfelder said Friday his clients 'have no recourse' but to sue now that the Goodrich school district has decided not to follow through on its initial plan to fire the fifth-grade student's teacher. The Goodrich Area Schools board voted 6-0 in a closed session on Thursday evening to withdraw its efforts to fire Nicole McVey and instead is suspending her for a year. Greenfelder says McVey taunted the boy, who has Asperger's syndrome. Ellis has since resigned, but McVey had been fighting the district's efforts to fire her. The video shows the boy, who has Asperger’s syndrome, with his chest resting on the chair’s seat and his head and arms stuck through an opening in the back. The voices of a woman and a man can be heard on the recording. Those belong to McVey and Oaktree Elementary School’s then-Principal Michael Ellis, said Greenfelder, who accused them of taunting his clients’ son. On the video, McVey can be heard questioning the boy in the video . about how he got stuck before asking: 'Do you want to get Tasered?' The . boy is told that a maintenance crew is on the way to help and . Greenfelder has said Ellis is heard saying it's really 'not an emergency . in their book'. Hearing: The school board had voted to seek to fire McVey in February but she now just be suspended for a year without pay . McVey apologized to the boy's parents in a letter writing 'there are no excuses or reasons or explanations for what happened'. In it, McVey, who has not spoken publicly since she was placed on leave following the incident that took place the week before Thanksgiving, writes that she has 'learned the severity' of her mistake. 'I have thought about November 22 every single day for the last 5 months and wish I could change every part of it,' she wrote. 'I . made a significant mistake,' her letter goes on to say. 'You need to . know that throughout this time my heart and my gut have told me that I . was wrong.' The fifth grade teacher writes she’s 'truly sorry” for making a “very bad series of choices.' McVey has spent 14 years in the district, which is about 40 miles northwest of Detroit. 'While . words will never be able to take away what happened, they provide the . only means that I have to request your forgiveness for betraying your . trusts in me, and to let you know that I am truly sorry,' her letter . says. 'I hope that you know I am not a bad person, but one who made a very bad series of choices on that day.' Support: Many parents at the board meeting in February said they thought McVey was a great teacher . Greenfelder said in February that the boy suffered broken blood vessels in his eyes while trying to escape from the chair. The . video came to light after a staff member responsible for reporting . bullying got ahold of it and informed administrators, said Greenfelder. After administrators saw the video, the Goodrich School Board voted to accept Ellis's resignation and seek to fire McVey by filing tenure charges. But the decision has upset some in the Goodrich school community, and numerous parents attended a board meeting with signs in support of McVey. 'I know she is supported by the community, the other teachers, the staff, I have learned a lot from her and I support her fully,' said Leanne Ruediger, a substitute teacher whose children attend the school. 'I believe that Nicole's intentions and motivations are always in the right place.' The footage caused an uproar when it was released to a TV station in February. But close to 200 pages of district e-mail correspondence indicate the three months between the video’s creation and its public airing were tumultuous as well. The e-mails show that Superintendent Scott Bogner quickly placed Ellis and McVey on leave and set about investigating. By January, Ellis had resigned and Bogner proposed that tenure charges be brought against McVey, a recommendation the school board approved. Bogner, meanwhile, delicately responded to e-mails from parents and students concerned about McVey’s absence. On December 9th, Bogner told a student who wanted McVey back that he was 'sorry that you guys have to be in the middle of this adult stuff.' Three days later, Bogner replied to a parent that some of the frustration “everyone is feeling” is 'being fueled by gossip, rumors and drama.' Scene: McVey has been suspended from Oaktree Elementary School in Goodrich, Michigan since February and will be now undergo a period of retraining before being allowed back into the classroom sometime in 2015 . Another parent added: 'There's no way that Mrs McVey ever bullied any child in that class.' They added that the word 'Taser' does not refer to a stun gun in the classroom context, but when you take two fingers and use them in a tickling motion on someone's side. The parents of the boy said they were upset by the support she had received and said they did not like the use of the word Taser. 'Our son did nothing wrong, but yet this seems to be another case of blaming the victim,' they added. The board voted 6-0 on Thursday to suspend McVey for a year without pay or benefits. She also agreed to attend remedial training focused on classroom relationships and the handling of student information. That change infuriated the student’s parents. While the district may have hoped that the apology letter would satisfy the parents, it was the opposite, Greenfelder said. 'Through all of this mess, the clients had been fully supportive of the superintendent and the school board on this difficult decision,' he said. 'Now, for whatever reason, they have reneged on the promise. ... A lawsuit appears to be their only recourse.' As for the boy, Greenfelder said he is “doing much better” under the guidance of the replacements for Ellis and McVey.","Nicole McVey filmed boy on cell phone when he got stuck in classroom .

"By . Wills Robinson . When a firework exploded in Chris Hignell’s face, he was blinded in one eye and doctors feared he would not survive. The 54-year-old from Yate near Bristol thought his life would never be the same, but years of pioneering plastic surgery has seen him get his looks back. In 2008, Mr Hignell was learning how to put on a fireworks display at a wedding, but the man teaching him, Jason Edgecombe, was uninsured and unqualified. Before: Chris Hignell, 54, from Yate near Bristol, was left with a series of horrific burn marks on his face after a professional display firework exploded in his face . When the professional display mortar went off - without the planned time delay - he was rushed to Frenchay Hospital, and surgeons doubted whether he would survive the night. He was not wearing goggles, ear defenders or gloves when he lit the fuse and he immediately hit the floor. But he managed to pull through, and six years after the ordeal has made significant progress. In the early stages of his treatment, Mr Hignell's injuries were so severe that . mirrors in hospital and home were initially covered up to prevent him . seeing the extent of his disfigurement. Despite still being blind in one eye, reconstructive surgery has transformed his life. In the split second of the accident, his skin had been effectively tattooed by hundreds of black burning sparks. Eight sessions of more traditional laser therapy did not remove them. But Julia Sarginson, a clinical fellow at North Bristol NHS Trust, and consultant Timothy Burge, used punch biopsies - which puncture small holes in the skin - to remove the minute marks. They removed up to 80 marks in a session. Normally, punch biopsies are used for one or two marks - for example, to remove tumours. But the idea of using them on such a large scale is now being talked about by plastic surgeons all over the world. Miss Sarginson, who worked on Mr Hignell, has released a research paper about it, and is flying to the United States to present the idea there. It could be used in the future to help other victims of blast injuries, including soldiers. After: A series of specialist procedures performed by surgeons at Frenhay Hospital called punch biopsys have seen most of the marks removed . A punch biopsy is done with a circular blade ranging in size from 1mm to 8mm. The blade is attached to a pencil-shaped instrument and is rotated down, piercing the outer layer of the skin. Samples can be taken from almost anywhere, including lungs, kidney, liver and stomach. Usually, it is used for taking small samples of skin to send to a pathologist for testing and is rarely used to remove skin. Normally only one or two marks are removed in a session, but Mr Hignell had around 80 taken off. Plastic surgeons all over the world are now talking about using the procedure on a large scale. Mr Hignell said: ‘When the accident first happened, I didn’t think my life would ever be the same. I didn’t think I would work, or go on holiday or anything - the first two years were very grim. ‘But now it is truly a transformation. The surgeons have changed my life and my face looks incredible by comparison. ‘Punch biopsies have never been used like this before. ‘I have had about 24 procedures in all, everything from putting a titanium plate into my eye to make it the right shape, to burning my eyelashes off because they were growing the wrong way. It’s all been rebuilt. ‘The most amazing one was the titanium. That kind of procedure used to take hours in theatre while they put the metal together, but they used a scan to make a resin model of my head, and built the eye plate on there. ‘Then all they had to do was make a slit in my skin and slide it in, which frees up surgery time and saves thousands.' The last of the surgery finished last year, and saw Mr Hignell having his eyelids rebuilt from skin grafts at Bristol Eye Hospital, as well as the end of his nose and corner of his lip being put back onto his face. Mr Hignell and his wife, Wendy, run a wholesale tea and coffee business. He is left with a constant headache due to nerve damage, which he manages with painkillers, and his treatment is ongoing. He said: ‘I was honoured to get this treatment. It’s going to go global, and I am so glad someone else won’t have to suffer as much, thanks to what they managed to achieve with me. ‘Bristol is so lucky to have a world-class plastics facility here.’ Edgecombe was given a nine-month suspended prison sentence after the incident. He was ordered to pay Mr Hignell £50,000 in compensation and was banned from organising a fireworks display for two years. Pioneering: Mr Hignell had around 24 procedures performed on him by specialists at the Bristol Eye Hospital .","A professional display mortar exploded in Chris Hignell's face in 2008 .

"By . Kate Lyons . The mother of one of the girls abused by former Hey Dad! actor Robert Hughes has called for an inquiry into why he was not charged by police when she reported his actions almost thirty years ago. The woman has spoken out just days before the 65-year-old actor is due to be sentenced for 10 child sex offences, committed between 1983 and 1991. Her daughter was abused at least three times while visiting Hughes' house on Sydney's north shore. Scroll down for video . Robert Hughes was found guilty of 10 child sex offences last month. The crimes occurred between 1983 and 1991 . On one occasion Hughes forced the girl to lay her head in his lap while he had an erection, under the pretence of administering ear medication to her. On two occasions he made her swim between his legs while his penis was exposed. The woman, who cannot be named, reported Hughes' abuse of her daughter in 1988, when the girl was nine, and her daughter reported the abuse again 10 years later, but both times police told her there was nothing they could do. She told the Sydney Morning Herald of the moment her daughter first spoke of the abuse. 'She crawled up next to me one day and said: ""Mummy, the next time Robert rings can you please say I can't go? … Robert makes me sit on his penis and I don't like it,""' she said. The mother of one of Hughes' victims (Hughes is pictured here with his wife Robyn Gardiner) has spoken out about her anger that police did not charge Hughes when she initially reported the abuse in 1988 . The mother reported the abuse to the girl's school a few days later and then made a statement to police. Both the police and the girl's school told her that they were aware of Hughes' reputation but nothing could be done. 'The detective said, ""I can't proceed."" He was quite distressed. He said, ""I've tried to get this guy but every time I do someone covers for him,'"" she said. Ten years later the daughter reported the abuse to police, this time in Queensland, but was again told that nothing could be done. The mother said the police's inaction devastated her daughter and meant that Hughes remained free to abuse other girls. 'There were all these horrible things that were done to these other girls after we went to the police,' she said. She added that the recent police investigation, which resulted in Hughes' conviction last month, was conducted with the 'utmost integrity and professionalism', but said an inquiry was necessary to find out why it took so long to bring charges against the actor. Hughes was the star of the popular sitcom Hey Dad! One of his co-stars, Sarah Monahan (bottom left) accused her on-screen father of abuse .","Girl was abused by Hey Dad! actor, 65, on three occasions in mid-1980s .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated Press Reporter . A plane crash in Arizona left one person dead and five injured Saturday after high winds caused difficulties as the aircraft attempted to land after a sight-seeing flight. The single engine Cessna 207 was carrying a pilot and six French tourists as it approached an airport in Page, about 200 miles north of Phoenix, and somehow toppled over and landed on its roof. The aircraft is shown in a photo sitting upside-down hundreds of feet short of the airport runway, but it is not clear exactly how much damage was sustained. Deadly crash: one person died and five were injured when this plane came up short of the runway and flipped over on impact . 'The plane hit the sand and flipped over upside down,' a police spokesperson said. Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor said the plane crash-landed 400 to 500 feet short of the runway. One passenger died after being rushed to a hospital, while another was taken to Flagstaff Medical Center. The deceased person has not yet been identified, but the hospitalized passenger is said to be in stable condition. Four others received hospital treatment for minor injuries and were released, while the seventh person was unhurt, authorities said. The pilot was among the injured. The passengers were all part of a French tour group, they have not been named. Both the captain and the FAA website listed the aircraft's registered owner as American Aviation Inc. of Salt Lake City. A person answering the phone there late Saturday said they didn't have any information. Varner said that the hometowns of the passengers were still being determined, but at least one of them was from the French city of Le Havre. There was no immediate word on the cause of the crash. Both Gregor and Varner said it was being investigated.","The single engine Cessna came up short of the runway while trying to navigate through treacherous winds .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Francesca Chambers . Members of a Secret Service special unit responsible for patrolling near the White House were pulled off that assignment over at least two months in 2011 to protect the assistant of the agency's director while she was engaged in a dispute with a neighbor, according to a report in The Washington Post. Agents were told that the Secret Service director at the time, Mark Sullivan, was concerned that his assistant was being harassed by her neighbor, the Post reported in a story posted Saturday night on its website. The newspaper cited three people familiar with the operation but did not provide their names. The agents were pulled from a surveillance team that patrols the outskirts of the White House compound and monitors the southern side of the executive mansion whenever crowds gather to watch the president and first family travel via motorcade or helicopter, the Post reported. 'It felt like an invasion': Maryland woman Brenda Allen, a former employee of the FBI, breaks down as she tells how Secret Service agents monitored her house for months. The surveillance came after an altercation with her neighbor, who worked for former Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan . Pulled from duty: A new report says that U.S. secret service agents tasked with patrolling the White House perimeter were removed from their post for two months in 2011 to monitor the friend of the then-director of Secret Service, Mark Sullivan . Agents inside the Washington field office were concerned that the diversion of agents increased security risks to the compound and the president, two people familiar with the discussion told the newspaper. A spokesman for the agency told the Post that the agents involved were not part of the president's protective detail and therefore the operation had no impact on it. Sullivan left the Secret Service in 2013 nearly a year after a scandal involving members of the presidential protection team hiring prostitutes ahead of a trip by President Barack Obama to Colombia in 2012. In a statement to the Post, Sullivan said a supervisor in his office authorized the visits to the assistant's home without his knowledge, that they lasted only a few days and that they were appropriate given the report of threats to an employee. Called 'Operation Moonlight' within the agency, the assignment that summer of 2011 called for two agents twice a day, in the morning and at night, to monitor the home of his assistant, the Post reported. It's personal: Former Secret Service director Mark Sullivan reportedly pulled agents from duty in order to protect his assistant, Lisa Chopey, who was having a dispute with her neighbors in Maryland . The residence was in a rural area outside the southern Maryland town of La Plata, nearly an hour's drive from Washington. Two agents put on Operation Moonlight thought the reassignment was a potentially illegal use of government resources and were concerned enough about their own liability that they kept records of their involvement and their superiors' instructions, the Post reported. The woman being monitored, Brenda Allen, said that the assistant involved, Lisa Chopey, had taken a restraining order against her partner, Michael Mulligan. Chopey accused Mulligan of once chasing her down in his truck. 'It was pure hell,' she said. 'It felt like an invasion. 'I still don't understand it. I worked for the FBI for 22 years - I'm not a threat.' Mulligan and Allen said they approached one of the cars one day to ask the occupants why they were parked in front of the house. But they said the car sped off. The couple said they barely went outside their house when the cars were there. Eventually, the mysterious surveillance and the tensions with the Chopey family led them to move, they said. Over time, the agents’ trips to La Plata grew less frequent, according to people familiar with the work, and by early fall, Operation Moonlight was over. Mulligan and Allen said they did not know they had been under Secret Service surveillance until informed last week by The Washington Post. 'I don't think the Secret Service should have been down to my house, watching me all the time,' Allen said. 'What threat do we pose? Why so much attention for this woman?' Some informed the inspector general for the Homeland Security Department about the operation, the newspaper said. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the White House was not aware of the allegations involving the president's protection and referred questions to the Secret Service, according to the Post. Scene: Four agents - two in the morning and two in the evening - were reportedly sent to the town of La Plata, Maryland, about a one hour drive from Washington, for the 'special assignment' Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan confirmed that agents were pulled off their White House duty to check on the safety of the director's assistant. However, he disputed accounts that Operation Moonlight lasted for months, saying agency records indicated that the assignment took place for only a few days over the Fourth of July weekend. Donovan said the operation was part of the agency's standard response to potential threats to an employee. House Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Rogers questioned the Secret Service's 'leadership culture' after the organization's latest 'black mark.' 'This is just one more example of a leadership failure at the secret service,' Rogers said on CBS on Sunday morning. 'When you have someone removed from a post whose primary responsibility is to protect the president and the White House's occupants, that is very, very concerning.' Rogers said the latest incident was of special concern because the current director of the Secret Service, Julia Pierson, was the chief of staff of the Secret Service at the time. 'So they're going to have some explaining to do, and maybe they've got great explanations. But they're going to have to come up and explain it, Rogers said. ;And if they can't get this piece right, I think you're going to have to look at a cultural leadership shift in the secret service.'","Operation Moonlight diverted agents to a rural area outside the southern Maryland town of La Plata in 2011 .

"By . Kate Lyons . and Daniel Mills . Two people have been charged over the abduction of a two-year-old girl from her home in Queensland on Saturday . Two people have been charged after a two-year-old girl was abducted from a Queensland home on Saturday night. A 21-year-old Queensland woman and 42-year-old Victorian man were charged with the abduction, as well as burglary and indictable offences. They are due to appear in the Ipswich Magistrates Court today. The girl was returned to her father after a state-wide search over the weekend. The girl's father  thanked people for their help finding his daughter, telling Nine News: 'I'm just glad she's back. She could've been anywhere, as long as she was safe.' The toddler was taken around 7.15pm on Saturday after three men allegedly burst into a home in suburban Willowbank, outside Ipswich in Queensland. The girl's father said he struggled to try rescue his daughter but could not break free from the 'big guy' who had him restrained. He told The Courier Mail: 'I just tried to reach for her, but the big guy pushed me back against wall.' He told police that, as they left, he had his face 'smashed' in. 'They just basically busted in, took the little child, and as I went to walk out the door they smashed me across the face,' he said. It is understood there were other children in the home at the time, who witnessed the abduction. A white Holden Commodore and a silver Mitsubishi sedan were seen driving slowly along Sancroft Street where the girl was taken. A neighbour said he saw the one of the cars but heard nothing from the house at the time the girl was taken. Another resident, Melissa Bolt, also said she heard no noise come from the house. 'It must have happened very quickly,' Mrs Bolt said.

Melbourne's Crown Casino is chasing Chinese national Zhao Li for an alleged $8 million gambling debt . The documents also claim Crown extended the high-roller's credit by millions of dollars on multiple days after Mr Li began his 13-day splurge on October 19, 2011. On October 24 Mr Li successfully applied to increase his credit limit to $8 million, and on October 29 he extended it again to $10 million. On October 31 Crown allowed the man to increase the limit to $13 million on the condition it was paid back that day, according to court documents. On Tuesday November 1 – Melbourne Cup Day – he requested $8 million in credit and ended the day allegedly owing the casino $6,895,632. Between October 19 and November 11 Crown issued five credit markers with the amount owed, which the defendant signed acknowledging the debt.

St. Louis' mother, France, died unexpectedly of a heart attack in Montreal on Thursday at age 63. Grieving: Martin St. Louis lost his mother France, then played with the Rangers to beat Pittsburgh . St. Louis traveled home after receiving the news shortly after the Rangers landed in Pittsburgh. He discussed the idea of playing with his father before telling New York coach Alain Vigneault that his mother would want him to be with his teammates. 'I owed it to her to do it,' St. Louis said. 'I know she would have wanted me to play. I was a tough day for everyone, but we've got to keep pushing.' The Rangers won 5-1 to stay alive in the series. 'She was with me the whole way': St Louis said he felt his mother's presence as he played Friday May 9 . Now it's on to Game 6 — Mother's Day — for a series that suddenly looks competitive now that the Rangers have apparently solved their woes with the man advantage.St. Louis, 36, is tied for four on the team in post-season scoring with two goals and six points in 12 games, though he has no points in the series against the Penguins.He was named the third star of the game on Friday.'She was with me the whole way,' St. Louis said of his mother.","New York Rangers forward Martin St Louis played against Pittsburgh Friday .

"By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary . The Washington Monument is set to reopen on Monday, after it was closed for almost 1,000 days. More than 150 cracks have been repaired, rainwater leaks have been sealed, and the 130-year-old monument will reopen for the first time in nearly three years since an earthquake caused widespread damage. The memorial honoring George Washington has been closed for about 33 months for engineers to conduct an extensive analysis and restoration of the 555-foot stone obelisk that was once the tallest structure in the world. The monument's white marble and mortar were cracked and shaken loose during an unusual 5.8-magnitude earthquake in August 2011 that sent some of the worst vibrations to the top. Debris fell inside and outside the monument, and visitors scrambled to evacuate. Later, engineers evaluated the damage by rappelling from the top, dangling from ropes. Reopening: The Washington Monument, which sustained damage from an earthquake in August 2011, will re-open to the public on Monday . New and improved: With more than 150 cracks patched and repaired in its white marble, the Washington Monument is set to reopen for the first time since the 2011 earthquake . Superintendent of the National Mall & Memorial Parks Bob Vogel told DCist it was only his third week on the job. 'We were very distraught,' he told the website, referring to the damage. During the monument's restoration, the . AP had a look at some of the worst damage from the 500-foot level. Stones were chipped and cracked all the way through with deep gashes in . some places. Others had hairline cracks that had to be sealed. Some . damaged marble was replaced with salvaged material or stone from the . same Maryland quarry as the monument's original marble.  The replacement . stone had been saved from the steps of old Baltimore row houses. New exhibits have been installed, and visitors can once again ride an elevator to look out from the highest point in the nation's capital. The full restoration cost $15 million. Businessman and philanthropist David Rubenstein contributed $7.5 million to pay half the cost and expedite the repairs. Rubenstein told The Associated Press on Sunday that he was surprised how much the monument means to people who have written him letters and email. He said he's pleased the job was done on time and on budget. Rebuilding: Worker Julio Dichis removes the fencing which closed the Washington Monument off to the public during renovations . Open again: Julio Dichis, right, and Jose Oreyana remove the monument's fencing . Damage: In this June 2, 2013 file photo, Bob Collie, project manager with Perini Management Services, puts his finger in a crack of the Washington Monument . 'It became clear to me that the Washington Monument symbolizes many things for our country — the freedoms, patriotism, George Washington, leadership,' he said. 'So it's been moving to see how many people are affected by it.' During an early look at the restored monument, Rubenstein hiked to the top, taking the stairs in a suit and tie. Memorial plaques inside the monument from each state seemed to be clean and intact, and the view 'is really spectacular,' he said. The billionaire co-CEO of The Carlyle Group has been urging other philanthropists to engage in what he calls 'patriotic philanthropy.' In time, he predicts more philanthropists will make similar gifts. Rubenstein is co-chair of a campaign to raise funds to help restore the National Mall, serves as a regent of the Smithsonian Institution and is chairman of the Kennedy Center. He has also made major gifts to the National Archives and Library of Congress. Repaired: Bob Vogel, superintendent of National Mall and Memorial Parks, points out a repaired crack inside the Washington Monument . Sealed over: a repaired crack is visible inside the Washington Monument . The monument was built in two phases between 1848 and 1884. When it was completed, it was the world's tallest structure for five years until it was eclipsed by the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The monument remains the world's tallest freestanding stone structure. It normally draws about 700,000 visitors a year. The National Park Service will offer extended hours to visit the monument beginning Tuesday and through the summer from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. each day. Tickets can be reserved online at Recreation.gov. Visiting the top has been a highlight for millions of people over the decades during tours of the nation's capital, said Caroline Cunningham, president of the nonprofit Trust for the National Mall, which is working to raise private funds to support the national park. The monument is expected to draw big crowds this year. 'The American people really gravitate to the Washington Monument,' Cunningham said. 'George Washington being our leader, it connects them to their country in a very personal way.' TODAY show weatherman Al Roker will host a reopening ceremony on Monday at 10am, the National Park Service said a press release.

"By . Gareth Rose . Lottery winners Chris and Colin Weir have bankrolled an astonishing 80 per cent of Yes Scotland’s fight to break up Britain, donating £2.5million to the cause in just 12 months. The full extent of the Weirs’ financial backing was laid bare yesterday when Yes Scotland finally released documents detailing the major donors for 2013/14 as the referendum date nears looms into sight. It shows that the Ayrshire couple, who won £161m in a Euromillions draw in 2011, has donated a total of £4.5m to SNP and the Yes campaign since their win - £1.5m more than had previously been estimated. Euromillions winners Chris and Colin Weir who received £161million in 2011 from the lottery draw . It means almost 80 per cent of £4.9million funding for the separation campaign has come from just one source – something the grassroots campaign Unlock Democracy warned was ‘unhealthy’. Critics said yesterday that the balance of funding was ‘unhealthy’ - and opponents Better Together claimed the figures made a mockery of Yes Scotland’s claims of diverse grass-roots support. Alexandra Runswick, director of Unlock Democracy, which campaigns for open and transparent politics, said: ‘I don’t think that’s healthy. ‘Whether it is one large donor funding a political party, or one side of a referendum, I don’t think that’s a healthy situation to be in. ‘It should not be determined by one person’s resources – you are giving one side a stronger voice than the other.’ The official referendum period, with stricter spending rules, does not start until May 30 – despite the fact that both sides have been campaigning hard for well over a year. ‘It’s absolutely right that after the Scottish referendum there should be a review of spending rules,’ Mrs Runswick said. The Weirs’ latest £2.5million pledge to Yes Scotland is their second to the pro-independence campaign, having previously donated £1million. And the couple, who scooped Scotland’s biggest ever lottery jackpot, also gave £1million to the SNP, in 2011. The couple have donated a total of £4.5m to SNP and the Yes campaign since their win - which is £1.5m more than had previously been estimated . In the new figures, Yes Scotland have also identified their other leading donors – although their contributions are dwarfed by the Weirs’. Randall Foggie, from Kirkcaldy, a lifelong Nationalist and failed SNP council candidate, donated £60,000. A further £50,000 came from Mark Shaw who, as well as being head of Hazeldene property group, is operations director at Yes Scotland. A respected businessman with a ‘no nonsense’ style, he was brought in by Yes Scotland a year ago to shore up the faltering campaign. Property developer Dan Macdonald, who is on the Yes Scotland advisory board and has previously donated to the SNP, gave £50,000. The other named donors are Norman Easton, who gave £10,000, and novelist and poet Mary McCabe, who contributed £8000. Yes Scotland said a further 11,000 people gave donations of less than £7,500, which in total came to £473,000. But Better Together said the dominance of the Weirs in the Yes Scotland balance sheets shows the campaign does not have the widespread support it claims. It means almost 80 per cent of £4.9million funding for the separation campaign, headed by Alex Salmond centre, has come from just one source . The pro-independence campaign has received almost double the £2.8million Better Together reported in December. However, if you take away the Weirs’ contribution, Better Together would have received more than £1million more. Blair McDougall, director of the pro-Union Better Together campaign, said: ‘No- one would criticise the Weirs, who are long standing SNP supporters. ‘It is extraordinary that compared to the tens of thousands of small donations received by Better Together from our supporters, almost 80 per cent of Yes Scotland’s money comes from one source. ‘We now know why they have been hiding their donations for so long. ‘Whilst Better Together relies on the support of a broad mixture of large donors and thousands of ordinary people giving what they can, it is clear that the nationalists are almost completely dependent on one source of income. The latest polls suggest one in three Scots support Salmond's bid for separation . ‘With a new poll showing just one third of Scots support leaving the UK, these donor details confirm that Yes Scotland is little more than a front for Alex Salmond’s SNP.’ Meanwhile, the Scottish Government has failed to reveal where it found the money for the £1.25million White Paper. Publishing and distributing the 649-page manifesto was funded out of taxpayers’ money - despite being full of SNP promises. The Scottish Conservatives – who branded it the ‘biggest ever taxpayer-funded work of fiction’ – have twice asked which government department had to foot the bill. However, Nicola Sturgeon, the Deputy First Minister who is also in charge of the referendum, has been unable to answer, giving another holding answer. Gavin Brown MSP, Scottish Conservative finance spokesman, said: ‘The Scottish Government has now decided to give a holding answer to a holding answer, which is something of a new phenomenon. ‘I asked a very straightforward question two months ago about what budget the White Paper expenditure came from, because from reading the Scottish Government budget, it is not at all clear. ‘Either the SNP doesn’t know where the money came from or it’s simply unwilling to say. ‘Neither of those scenarios is acceptable, and the full costs and how they were paid for must be published as a matter of urgency.’ A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: ‘The Scottish Government will respond to Mr Brown’s parliamentary question in due course. Ministers have been open and transparent regarding the costs involved.’ The Scottish Government will go into purdah on August 21 – meaning no new policies will be announced until after the referendum – but stricter rules come into force for the parties and campaigners this month. The regulated period will run for 16 weeks from May 30 and Yes Scotland and Better Together will be restricted to spending £1.5million each. The SNP will be allowed to spend £1.344million, Labour £834,000, the Tories £396,000, the Liberal Democrats £201,000, and the Greens – who support independence - £150,000. Blair Jenkins, chief executive of Yes Scotland, said: ‘We greatly appreciate and are hugely encouraged by the thousands of people across Scotland who have made donations – both large and small – according to their financial means. Mr and Mrs Weir declined to comment.","Ayrshire couple won £161million in Euromillions lottery draw in 2011 .

Garfield and stolen a set of commemorative spoons (file photo) The thieves took the 13 silver spoons which have Garfield's face engraved on them, but left behind the cash donation box . A cemetery worker discovered the theft Wednesday. Police reports say cigarette butts, a T-shirt and a whiskey bottle were recovered. The cemetery's website says Garfield is the only president to have his casket on full display. His wife Lucretia Rudolph Garfield, has a casket next to his. Vandals went to the trouble of shattering a window to get inside the 180-foot-tall monument at Lakeview Cemetery in Cleveland Heights . The cemetery's website says Garfield is the only president to have his casket on full display . James A. Garfield was the 20th President of the United States . Katherine Goss, president and chief executive of Lake View Cemetery, which houses the Garfield tomb told The Washington Post the spoons, 'would be hard to sell in a historical auction because everyone would wonder where they came from.' She said the fact that only the silver spoons were stolen lead her to guess that 'someone had to prove that they had been inside the monument — so they had to take something.' Garfield, the nation's 20th president, was born in the Cleveland suburb of Moreland Hills. On July 2, 1881, Garfield was shot in a Washington railroad station by a man who had been turned down for a job with the President. In a critical condition from the bullet, Garfield lay in the White House for weeks. Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, tried to find the bullet with an induction-balance electrical device which he had designed - he was unsuccessful.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Two women were married on a sidewalk outside a county courthouse in Arkansas on Saturday, breaking a barrier that state voters put in place with a constitutional amendment 10 years ago. A day after Pulaski County Circuit Judge Chris Piazza said the ban was 'an unconstitutional attempt to narrow the definition of equality,' Kristin Seaton, 27, and Jennifer Rambo, 26, exchanged vows at an impromptu ceremony, officiated by a woman in a rainbow-colored dress. The couple had spent the night in their Ford Focus after traveling to Eureka Springs from their home at Fort Smith, and was the first of about 10 couples to line up outside of the courthouse before it opened. Jennifer Rambo (right) kisses her wife Kristin Seaton following their marriage ceremony in front of the Carroll County Courthouse in Eureka Springs, Ark. on Saturday . Rambo and Seaton were the first same-sex couple to be granted a marriage license in Eureka Springs after a judge overturned Amendment 83, which banned same-sex marriage in the state of Arkansas . Sheila McFadden (center) and Ken Riley (right) yell words of encouragement at the crowd gathered in front of the Carroll County Courthouse after initially being turned away for a marriage license in Eureka Springs, Ark. 'Thank God,' Rambo said after Carroll County Deputy Clerk Jane Osborn issued them a license, ending a brief period of uncertainty when a different deputy county clerk said she wasn't authorized to grant one and questioned whether Piazza's order in a courtroom 150 miles away had any bearing in Eureka Springs. Piazza ruled Friday that Arkansas' 2004 voter-approved amendment to the state constitution violates the rights of gay couples, clearing the way for the first same-sex marriage in a traditional southern state. He didn't put his ruling on hold as some judges in other states have done. That caused confusion among the state's 75 county clerks, said Association of Arkansas Counties executive director Chris Villines. He said Piazza should have issued a stay, just to avoid Saturday's scramble. 'The court didn't give us any time to get the kinks worked out,' Villines said. Attorney General Dustin McDaniel said he would appeal the ruling and asked it be suspended during that process. Jennifer Rambo (left) of Jacksonville, Ark., kisses her wife Kristin Seaton (right) of Fort Smith, Ark., as they wait in line at the Carroll County Courthouse to apply for a marriage license . No appeal had been filed as of Saturday morning when the license was issued. Jerry Cox, president of the Arkansas Family Council, which promoted the gay-marriage ban in 2004, said Piazza's decision to not suspend his ruling will create confusion if a stay is issued later. 'Are these people married? Are they unmarried?' Cox said. 'Judge Piazza did a tremendous disservice to the people of Arkansas by leaving this in limbo.' Arkansas' amendment was passed in 2004 with the overwhelming support of Arkansas voters. Piazza's ruling also overturned a 1997 state law banning gay marriage. 'The exclusion of a minority for no rational reason is a dangerous precedent,' he wrote. The U.S. Supreme Court last year ruled that a law forbidding the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages was unconstitutional. Since then, lower-court judges have repeatedly cited the decision when striking down some of the same-sex marriage bans that were enacted after Massachusetts started recognizing gay marriages in 2004. It's official: Jane Osborn (right) deputy clerk for Carroll County, issues the first marriage license to Kristin Seaton (left) and her partner Jennifer Rambo, at the Carroll County Courthouse in Eureka Springs, Ark., on Saturday . Federal judges have ruled against marriage bans in Michigan, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Texas, and ordered Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee to recognize same-sex marriages from other states. In all, according to gay-rights groups, more than 70 lawsuits seeking marriage equality are pending in about 30 states. Democratic attorneys general in several states — including Virginia, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Oregon and Kentucky — have declined to defend same-sex marriage bans. Arkansas' ruling came a week after McDaniel became the first statewide elected official to announce he personally supports gay marriage rights. But he said he would continue to defend the constitutional ban in court. Aaron Sadler, McDaniel's spokesman, said Friday the attorney general sought the stay because 'we know that questions about validity of certain actions will arise absent a stay'. Gay marriage is legal in Maryland, Delaware and the District of Columbia. Though technically considered southern states by the U.S. Census, they were not part of the old Confederacy, like Arkansas.","On Saturday Kristin Seaton, 27, and Jennifer Rambo, 26, became the first same-sex couple in Arkansas to receive an official marriage license .

The 9mm pistol that Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev used to murder one police officer and gravely wound another came from a brutal street gang in Maine that is allegedly led by an Eritrean immigrant. Tracking the path of the Ruger P95 semiautomatic pistol has led investigators to believe he may have dealt drugs to finance the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings that killed three spectators and injured more than 260 others. Drug money is also believed to have funded the 26-year-old's 2012 trip to Chechnya and Dagestan in Russia, where he became involved in radical Islam. Fighter: Tamerlan Tsarneav had a semiautomatic pistol that he used to killed one police officer and wound another as he tried to escape Boston after the bombings . Deadly: Tsarnaev had a Ruger P95 9mm pistol, similar to the one shown here. It carries 15 rounds in the magazine and can be purchased for $375 or less . The Los Angeles Times reports that Tamerlan used the weapon to ambush 27-year-old MIT police officer Sean Collier April 18, 2013 and kill him. Collier died of multiple gunshot wounds. Then, when authorities closed in on Tamerlan and his brother Dzhokhar as they fled Boston, Tamerlan opened fire with the pistol. He shot at officers until the gun was either empty or it jammed. Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority officer Richard Donohue Jr, 33, was critically wounded in the shootout. Tamerlan was killed after being shot multiple times by officers and then run over and dragged as his younger brother tried to escape in a stolen SUV, authorities say. When investigators recovered the handgun, they found that the serial numbers had been scratched off - a common tactic among drug dealers who are hoping to prevent police from tracking down the original owner of the weapon. However, agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were able to decipher the unique identifier - serial number 317-87693, according to the Times. Ambushed: Tsarnaev used the handgun to murder Sean Collier, an MIT police officer (left). He fired the weapon in a shootout in which Richard Donohue, a Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority officer,  was critically wounded . Shootout: Tsarnaev emptied the magazine of his pistol - 15 rounds - at police before he was gunned down April 19 . They found that it was legally purchased at a Cabella's sporting goods store outside Portland, Maine, in November 2011 by Danny Sun Jr - a Los Angeles native. The gun typically sells for about $375. Sun told investigators that he gave the pistol to Biniam Tsegai, a 27-year-old Eritrean immigrant who goes by the street name 'Icy.' The Times reports that Tsegai is a reputed leader of a Portland, Maine, street gang with a lengthy arrest record - including robbery, criminal trespass and reckless driving. In May 2013 - a month after the marathon bombings - Tsegai was arrested and indicted on federal drug trafficking charges. Prosecutors noted that the drugs he is accused of trafficking were brought from Boston to Maine. Tsegai has refused to talk to authorities about the Ruger pistol - or anything else. However, Tsarnaev's possession of the weapon have strengthened their suspicions that he was involved in drug trafficking. They have not been able to prove his involvement, but suspect he had something to do with the September 11, 2011 murder of three men in an apartment outside Boston who were found with the throats slit. Marijuana and $1,000 in cash was found sprinkled around the crime scene.","Tamerlan Tsarnaev was found with a Ruger P95 9mm pistol after he was killed by police .

"By . Jennifer Smith . For many children, the new school year means a reinvention of playground style, with cooler schoolbags and brighter pencil cases replacing last year's tired trends. The majority of discarded attire is forgotten about for years to come, as are the once loved fictional figures who were proudly paraded on the front of lunchboxes. But one man is pleased to remind the world of times gone by, with an astonishing collection of metal lunchboxes in Columbus, Georgia. Scroll down for video . The Lunchbox Museum in Columbus, Georgia is home to more than 2,000 vintage lunchboxes and thermoses . Though Mr Woodall has been collecting metal lunchboxes for over 30 years, he carried his lunch to school in a paper bag . The Lunchbox Museum in the Rivermarket Antique Mall is the ultimate destination for a trip down memory lane, with more than 2,000 vintage lunchboxes and thermoses hanging from its walls and ceiling. Open since 1991 the world's largest lunchbox museum reminds visitors of the things they loved as children, to the delight of curator, Allen Woodall. Mr Woodall, 79, fell in love with the colourful metal boxes when he saw two at a flea market as a child, after using a brown paper bag to carry his own lunch to school, he told Cool Hunting. After purchasing the Green Hornet and Dick Tracey boxes, he went on to amass the shop's collection over 30 years, before deciding to open the museum in 1991. He told MailOnline: 'I've always had a passion for lunchboxes. 'Around 1989 I took a trip to St Louis to view the collection of a man who had died' Among his hoard of 80s classics are Bee Gees, Beatles and Star Wars boxes which help remind visitors of things they once loved . Metal lunchboxes went out of fashion in the 1980s when plastic models became more popular . 'His widow was selling the lunchboxes which had attracted collectors from New York and L.A. and all over the place.' Mr Woodall said he knew he didn't stand much of a chance at getting his hands on the boxes with other such experienced enthusiasts there. 'I knew it would be hard for the widow to be selling them. Footage courtesy Cool Hunting . 'So I gave her my word that if she sold them to me, I would use them as the foundation for a museum, and dedicate my book to her late husband,' which is exactly what he did. His Illustrated Encyclopedia of Metal Lunchboxes was published in 1992 with a dedication to Mr Bob Carr on its front pages. Mr Carr's collection of 750 lunchboxes was the beginning of the museum which is now home to more than 2,000 lunch boxes, thermoses, and related memorabilia. 79-year-old Allen Woodall decided to open the museum after purchasing the collection of another enthusiast in 1989 . The 'off the wall' collection features lunchboxes from WWI in addition to more popular, modern models inspired by TV, film and books . Mr Woodall sources the boxes from all over the country by buying, selling and trading online . Among the most rare is an original Beatles Yellow Submarine box, and a Star Wars model from the 1980s, while the oldest date back to WWI. Unsurprisingly, designs were a little simpler back then, with drawings of trains and boy scouts proudly shown where the Bee Gees and Batman stood later. 'I only sell duplicates' said Mr Woodall who keeps original models in the museum's safe possession for passers-by to admire. Keen for visitors to touch the lunchboxes for themselves, Mr Woodall merely cleans and polishes them to keep them in good condition. Metal lunchboxes went out of fashion in the 1980s after the more easily sourced and moulded plastic became more popular.

"By . Associated Press . A teenage German foreign exchange student who was shot dead by a Montana homeowner when he wandered into his garage was apparently looking for alcohol, authorities have said. According to court records made public on Monday, Diren Dede, 17, and Ecuadorian foreign exchange student Robby Pazmino were out walking in the Missoula neighborhood when Dede entered Markus Kaarma's garage on April 27. Pazmino told police he thought Dede was looking for alcohol. Tragic: German exchange student Diren Dede, 17 (pictured left and right) was shot dead by a Montana homeowner on April 27 . Mr Kaarma and his girlfriend said they had . been burgled twice in the three weeks before the shooting. Kaarma . allegedly told a hairdresser several days prior that he was waiting up . to kill the intruders, whom he referred to as 'kids,' according to court . documents. He faces one count of deliberate homicide. Pazmino . also informed police that they had learned about 'garage hopping' or . 'garage shopping' from local friends and had participated with other . friends three or four times in the past. But he denied taking any items . from Mr Kaarma's garage, the affidavit stated.

Mr Kaarma told authorities he . heard a metallic noise the night of the shooting, panicked and opened . fire into the darkened garage. Authorities say he fired blindly, . 'sweeping the interior of the garage to the left with a total of four . rounds.' Dede was hit twice, once in the arm and once in the head. A . court document last week disclosed that Missoula police received a . judge's permission to test whether Mr Kaarma was drunk or high when he . shot and killed Dede. Officers reportedly found a jar of marijuana in Mr . Kaarma's home the day he shot Dede, a police statement accompanying an . April 28 request for a search warrant said. Police believe Kaarma . 'may have been impaired by alcohol, dangerous drugs, other drugs, . intoxicating substances or a combination of the above, at the time of . the incident,' the statement from Detective Dean Chrestenson said. District Judge Karen Townsend granted the warrant to draw Mr Kaarma's blood to test whether any traces of intoxicants remained.

"By . Snejana Farberov . Big spender: Jeffrey Burnham, 41, a former vice president and regional mortgage sales manager at TD Bank in Maine, allegedly used a corporate credit card to charge nearly $220,000 at strip clubs . A former executive at TD Bank in Maine is facing criminal charged for allegedly using a corporate credit card to spend nearly $220,000 at strip clubs. Jeffrey Burnham, of Arundel, is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court in Portland Thursday to face a federal charge of theft by a bank officer. According to court documents, the 41-year-old Burnham used the card 72 times at strip clubs in Maine, Massachusetts, New York and Florida from February 2011 until February 2012, when he left the company. Burnham was a vice president and regional mortgage sales manager in the bank's Falmouth office at the time. Authorities say Mr Burnham claimed the spending was for business-related purposes. If convicted of theft, Mr Burnham could face up to 30 years in prison and a $1million fine, Portland Press Herald reported. The Arundel man left TD in February 2012 after 14 years with the bank and went to work for Kennebunk Savings Bank, where he was promoted to senior vice president of retail banking last year. A press release announcing Burham’s career move described him as a graduate of the University of Maine at Farmington who served on the Arundel Recreation and Economic Development committees. According to an affidavit written by FBI agent Paul Pritchard, the former banker used his TD-issued credit card to charge nearly $11,000 on December 2, 2011 at a company that operates Centerfolds strip club in Boston. Gentleman's club: An FBI affidavit states that Burnham spent $35,000 at Centerfolds club in Boston and another venue in Portland in less than one month . His other adult entertainment venue of choice was PT's Show club in Portland, stated the affidavit.He allegedly spent $35,000 at Centerfolds and Pt's club in less than a month. Burnham's alleged financial malfeasance was uncovered in February 2012 – shortly after his departure from TD - when another bank employee opened his corporate credit card statement and noticed several suspicious charges. When confronted about the expenses by TD investigators, the 41-year-old man admitted to misappropriating corporate funds. Hotspot: PT's Show club in Portland was one of the many venues where Burnham had allegedly spent company funds . In March 2013, Mr Burnham was questioned by FBI after his use of the corporate credit card, at which time he once again confessed to wrongdoing. Burnham has not been arrested, and his attorney, Sarah Church, expects him to remain free after being formally charged later this week.","Jeffrey Burnham, 41, could face up to 30 years in prison and $1million fine if convicted of theft by a bank officer charge .

"By . Meghan Keneally . One of the air conditioner systems at a LaGuardia Airport security checkpoint has led to the first chaotic day of the summer travel season for New Yorkers after they were left in sauna-like conditions when it broke down on Monday. The breakdown of an AC system in a portion of the New York City airport forced all of the travelers in Terminal C to use only one of the two security checkpoints. The onslaught of extra bodies led to massive lines and overheating which was not helped by the fact that TSA workers walked off. Long lines and overheating: One of the terminals two security checkpoints was forced closed causing passengers to be huddled together in the sauna-like conditions . Several TSA officers were allowed to go home early because they felt ill due to the conditions. 'Our TSA officers are working in some adverse conditions and we are making sure that they are hydrated,' the agency said in a statement to Fox News. 'Our officers are going above and beyond to staff the checkpoints while the air conditioning system is being addressed.' The agents, who work for the federal government, are now allowed to wear their summer uniforms in an effort to keep cool. MyFoxNY reports that one female passenger passed out as a result of the heat. Terminal C is owned and operated by Delta Airlines and many of their shuttle service flights to Washington D.C. and Boston are run out of those gates. 'Third World': LaGuardia Airport was the butt of a joke by Joe Biden earlier this year where he said that the Queens, New York airport was as upp to date as one from a poverty-stricken country . 'Unfortunately, the air conditioning at . Delta's LaGuardia Terminal C operation stopped working Monday morning,' Delta spokeswoman Morgan Durrant told Fox. The cause is still being investigated and they suggested that the outage was 'possibly related to construction but can't confirm that with 100 percent certainty'. 'Delta regrets the uncomfortable airport experience for our customers. MailOnline's calls to Delta about the latest conditions in the terminal were not immediately returned. The archaic conditions at LaGuardia were the butt of a joke by vice President Joe Biden in February when he joked that it looked as if it was in a third world country and not the heart of America's biggest city. Monday's air conditioner meltdown was not the first time in the past week that LaGuardia passengers were inconvenienced.

"By . Associated Press . OR7, a gray wolf that has wandered all over Oregon and beyond after being collared with a GPS device, may have found a mate. Wildlife authorities said cameras in the southern Cascades captures several images of what appears to be a female wolf in the same area where OR7's collar shows where he has been living. It is likely the pair spawned pups, officials said, and if confirmed, the rare predators would be the first breeding pair of wolves in the Oregon's Cascade Range since the early 1900s. OR7: This remote camera photo taken on May 3 shows the tagged wolf, which has traveled for thousands of miles in search of a mate . U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service . biologist John Stephenson said it is not proof, but it is likely the two . wolves mated over the winter and are rearing pups that would have been . born in April. Biologists won't start looking for a den until June, to . avoid endangering the pups. 'It's amazing that he appears to have found a mate,' Mr Stephenson said. 'I didn't think it would happen. It makes me more impressed with the ability of wolves to survive and find one another.' Young wolves typically leave their pack and strike out for a new territory, hoping to find a mate and start a new pack. OR7 has been looking for a mate since leaving the Imnaha pack in northeastern Oregon in September 2011. New mate? The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is excited after this photo, taken in the southern Cascades, showed a different wolf in the same area as OR7 . His travels have taken him thousands of miles as he crossed highways, deserts and ranches in Oregon, moved down the spine of the Cascade Range deep into Northern California and then back to Oregon, all without getting shot, having an accident or starving. Along the way, he was photographed by a hunter's trail camera in the Cascades outside Medford and by a biologist informing ranchers in Northern California he was in the area. Federal Endangered Species Act protections for wolves have been lifted in eastern Oregon, where the bulk of them reside, but they remain in force in the Cascades. Protections for the animals have also ended in the last several years in the Northern Rockies and western Great Lakes. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed ending the listing across most of the rest of the country as populations have rebounded. A final decision is expected later this year. The battery on OR7's GPS collar was expected to die soon, so, based on the wolf's most recent locations, Mr Stephenson placed trail cameras. The black and white photograph appears to have captured a female black wolf. Experts now hope to draw a DNA sample to see where this second animal has come from . The GPS locations also showed OR7 was staying within a smaller area, common behavior when wolves have pups to feed. When he checked the cameras last week, Stephenson said he found one had recorded a black wolf he had not seen before. An hour later, OR7 was photographed on the same camera. The black wolf was confirmed female because she squatted to urinate. Officials had planned to let OR7's collar die, but now that he appears to have found a mate, he will be fitted with a new one this summer to monitor the pack. Mr Stephenson said they had no idea where the female came from. If she can be captured, they can draw a DNA sample to see if she is related to the Idaho wolves that started moving into Oregon in the 1990s. Separately in Iowa, an animal shot dead by a coyote hunter in February was the first gray wolf spotted in the state since at least 1925, DNA testing has confirmed.The hunter, who hasn't been named, shot the female wolf near Fairbank in northwest Buchanan County believing it to be a similar-looking coyote. It is legal to shoot coyote in Iowa, though hunting wolves is illegal as they are a protected species.On closer inspection, the hunter thought the supposed coyote may have been a wolf and brought the animal to the DNR office in Manchester, where biologists examined it and took DNA samples.","OR7 has been tracked since leaving his pack in 2011 .

"By . Michael Zennie . AJ McCarron - who helped lead the Alabama Crimson Tide to three national championships as quarterback - thought he was sure to be a first-round NFL draft pick - second round at worst. When he was finally drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the fifth round Saturday - 164th overall pick - he unleashed a massive Twitter rant against his critics and reports that he 'rubbed teams the wrong way.' McCarron - who is known nearly as much for his bikini model fiance Katherine Webb as he is for on-the-field heroics - revealed that he played through several injuries at the University of Alabama and 'sacrificed a lot' to make the team successful. Scroll down for video . Pick me! Former Alabama Crimson Tide quarterback AJ McCarron was selected in the fifth round of the NFL draft by the Cincinnati Bengals . Rant: After he was picked, McCarron went on a Twitter tirade about his critics and reports that 'personality problems' prevented him from going higher in the draft . 'I never said I didn't love my time at Bama I said myself & other guys played through a lot of injuries for our great university & for fans..' he tweeted. 'To hear people make up rumors ab you that aren't true. That's what sucks when you sacrificed so much for your team & university while there!' In April, he told an Alabama radio show that 'pretty much everyone' told him that he'd be picked by an NFL team in the first round or early in the second round of the draft. But, according to AL.com, criticism began to mount when the draft went into the fourth and fifth rounds without any teams choosing the 23-year-old Alabama native. One EPSN radio announcer reported that scouts saw potential in him, but team managers found he 'rubbed them the wrong way' in interviews. Excited: On the first day of the draft, McCarron's girlfriend Katherine Webb posted a quote from scripture: 'For I know the plans I have for you... plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.' Her fiance wasn't picked for two more days in the fifth round . McCarron's fiance Katherine Webb has been his constant companion in the spotlight - ever since she catapulted to fame at the 2012 National Championship game . Famous fiance: McCarron is nearly as famous for his bikini model better half Katherine Webb as he is for his on-the-field heroics . Happy couple: Webb and McCarron have carried on their relationship - even though he was still at the University of Alabama and she was pursuing her modeling career . NFL Network reporter Ian Rapoport said teams and scouts had questions about McCarron's 'personality issues.' 'Questions from evaluators: How much do teammates really like him? How much did he really follow him,' Rapoport asked on air. McCarron was a runner-up for the Heisman Trophy and was quarterback for two of the most powerful college football teams in recent memory - but because of the way Alabama Crimson Tide teams are built, those figures alone don't automatically translate into NFL success. McCarron's predecessor as Alabama quarterback, Greg McElroy, was picked in the seventh round of the NFL draft in 2011. He played two games for the New York Jets and retired from football last year to become a college football analyst on the SEC Network. Tim Tebow, who won the Heisman Trophy and a national championship with the Florida Gators, famously struggled to impress coaches in the NFL - despite one banner playoffs run.

Secret wedding: Adam Scott (pictured playing golf on Sunday) married Marie Kojzar on APril 17 and didn't even tell their guests what the party was for . 'We just wanted it to be a secret for the day, and then we haven't told anyone to keep it a secret since,' he said. 'But I think people didn't want to do the wrong thing by me. So I've got them right where I want them.' He has not played since the Masters, keeping to the same schedule as last year. When he showed up at The Players Championship, he was not wearing a ring. 'We have rings, but I've never played with one, so I wasn't going to start this week,' Scott said. 'We'll see if it makes it to the course or not.' Scott's bride did not travel to a lot of golf tournaments when they first were dating more than a decade ago, and he said that probably wouldn't change. Several in the crowd called out congratulations to him throughout the third round. The golf wasn't bad, either. Scott got off to a rough start Saturday and finished strong for a 69. He was 3-under par, still with an outside chance at finishing high enough to replace Tiger Woods at No. 1 in the world ranking next week.","Adam Scott, 33, married Swedish architect Marie Kojzar on April 17 .

Surveillance images of the pair in action during one of the alleged incidents have been released in the hopes of identifying them. The two wide-set women can be seen directing the little girl, who is believed to be about four-years-old, to grab a purse that was near a cash register at the Karma Boutique in Queens, cops said on Monday.

"By . Joel Christie . A brave eight-year-old Florida girl successfully helped delivery her baby brother as her mother went into early labor at home on Monday, calmly following the instructions of a 911 dispatcher. The dramatic turn of events, which occurred around 7am after 29-year-old expectant mom Krystle Garcia called 911, was caputred on audio, with the panic-stricken Tampa Bay woman saying she was bleeding excessively. As Tampa Fire Rescue dispatched paramedics to the home, it was up to Garcia's daughter, Jazmine McEnaney, to take the reins of the delivery. 'She's in so much pain,' the little says at the start of the recording, according to The Tampa Bay Times. Scroll down for recording . An eight-year-old to the rescue: Jazmine McEnaney, seen here with baby brother Joseph, helped mother Krystle Garcia when she went into early labor on Monday . Happy and healthy: Krystle Garcia rests in Tampa General Hospital following the surprise home birth of her son, Joseph . 'Can you get some dry towels and a blanket to wrap the baby in and try to find a string or shoelace and maybe a safety pin, if you can?' she told Jazmine. 911 dispatchers follow a protocol in such circumstances. The string of shoelace is used to tie off the umbilical chord, while the safety pin would be used to tear the amniotic sac - or bag of waters - if it has not broken naturally. The dispatcher guided the two as the baby started to emerge, with Jazmine following instructions to hold the boy's head and support his shoulders. 'Oh my God, she's freaking out - she's only 8 years old,' Garcia said on the recording. But Jazmine kept it together, with paramedics arriving within minutes and taking over. 'Its brought us closer': Krystle Garcia said the dramatic delivery of her second child has forged a special bond with her first child, Jazmine. The two are pictured here in a photo from Facebook . The baby was delivered at the house before mother and son were transferred to Tampa General Hospital in good condition, according to Fire Rescue. The boy was named Joseph James Snyder. After the birth, Garcia said it was the composure of the dispatcher that ensured everything went smoothly - and that she couldn't have done it without her daughter. 'If it wasn't for her being calm as she was, it would've been a lot worse,' she said. 'Even though she was telling her what to do, that's a lot for an 8-year-old.' After the fright, Jazmine wasn't leaving her mother's side. 'I think it's something that's brought us closer,' Garcia said.","Krystle Garcia, 29, went into early labor at 38 weeks on Monday in Tampa Bay .

"By . Adam Duggan . There is growing evidence that obese women are putting additional strain on already under pressure maternity wards. A new study, conducted by the University of Melbourne and to be completed by the end of this year, will measure 15,000 births to obese women across seven Victorian hospitals. The ‘Mum size’ study will examine the effect of a mother’s BMI on caesarian time, pregnancy complications and their newborn child’s health. Putting pressure on a stretched system: Anaesthetists are warning that obese women are putting increased pressure on maternity wards and hospitals . Utilising data already collected by maternity units, the research team will use the available data to study the interaction between mother’s size and birthing times. ‘We have an increasing number of larger women coming through maternity services – there’s a lot of anecdotal evidence that it's harder to care for larger women,’ Professor Dave Story, chair of Anaesthesia at the University of Melbourne, told MailOnline. The study will not just be looking at the birthing process itself, but also the follow-on impact children born to overweight mother’s may have on the overall health system. With little currently known about the link between overweight mothers and their child’s overall health, beyond the fact that sometimes their babies are born at a higher weight, the study will be useful in forecasting neonatal care in the future. Professor Story is hopeful that the study will assist hospitals in planning the services provided for women having babies. Ultimately, the study’s goal is to ‘look at the association with maternal BMI and the outcomes for their kids.’ Not much known: Little is currently known about the long-term risks faced by children born to obese mothers . Beyond the more well-known conditions faced by overweight women during pregnancy such as pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes, Professor Story added that there were also complications during the birthing process. Overweight women also face an ‘increased risk of wound infection, the duration of the surgery, the amount of tissue involved and potentially also increased bleeding.’ The 'Mum size' study comes as anaesthetists re-examine the guidelines for administering surgery drugs to overweight patients. ‘We've known for a long time that a lot of the drugs we use are affected by the patient's body size and height,’ Professor Story said. ‘We need to alter our drugs, depending on how large a patient is.’ But luckily, with Australia’s growing obesity epidemic, Professor Story says they’re getting better at it.","Utilising already existing data collected by maternity units .

"By . James Rush . US Air Force and RAF pilots had a mid-air row in the skies over Norfolk after the American pilot accused a Tornado of flying too close to parachutists during an exercise, according to a new report. The pilot of the American MC-130 transport craft filed a near-miss report about a Tornado GR4 fighter, claiming it came too close to the parachutists it had dropped near the village of Sculthorpe last November. After the US pilot radioed a warning to the British fighter, the Tornado pilot radioed back that he 'had every right to be here' according to a UK AirProx Board (UKAB) review of the incident. The aircraft came within two miles of each other at their closest point, according to the UKAB, which investigates near-misses. The pilot of an American MC-130 transport craft filed a near-miss report about a Tornado GR4 fighter (file picture shows an MC-130 aircraft) The USAF pilot claimed there was a 'high' risk to the parachutists during the incident. But the RAF pilot, flying one of several Tornados in the area in November 7, told the UKAB they had been visible at all times and the severity of the incident was 'low'. Local military air traffic control reported it as 'negligible'. The UKAB report said the USAF pilot was . 'clearly frustrated by the continued presence of the Tornados' but it . had determined there was no risk to the parachutists. After the US pilot radioed a warning to the British fighter, the Tornado pilot radioed back that he 'had every right to be here' according to a UK AirProx Board (UKAB) review of the incident (file picture shows a Tornado GR4) The report states: 'The Board quickly agreed that both the MC130 and the Tornado pilots were entitled to be operating in the area and blocks reported.' Some members of the investigation board felt the Tornado pilots could have been more flexible, it said. It added: 'However, members felt that the mis-match in perception could quite easily have been prevented with the application of effective co-ordination between these two units who both commonly use the busy East Anglian airspace.'","US Air Force MC-130 pilot filed near-miss report about a Tornado GR4 fighter .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Keith Crisco, an Asheboro, North Carolina businessman who was running neck-and-neck with former American Idol runner up Clay Aiken for a Democratic congressional nomination, died suddenly Monday afternoon. According to the Asheboro Courier-Tribune, the 71-year-old died of injuries sustained in a fall at his home. Aiken was leading Crisco by just 369 votes in the primary race, and it was considered too close to call. Incumbent Rep. Renee Ellmers, a Republican, will now likely take on Aiken in November. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Rest in peace: Congressional candidate Keith Crisco died at his home in Asheboro, N.C. on Monday, putting singer Clay Aiken in the November congressional race against Renee Ellmers . Clay Aiken (R) was officially leading Crisco by 369 votes before outstanding absentee and provisional ballots were counted, and now seems to be the Democrats' definite November candidate . 'I am deeply saddened by this sudden and painful tragedy and wish God's blessings for Keith's family through the coming days,' Ellmers said Monday. 'His kindness and dedication to his principles were models we should all strive toward, and he will be dearly missed.' Aiken, 35, issued a statement shortly after the news was confirmed by Crisco's textile company, Asheboro Elastics. 'I am stunned and deeply saddened by Keith Crisco's death,' the entertained said. 'Keith came from humble beginnings. No matter how high he rose – to Harvard, to the White House and to the Governor's Cabinet – he never forgot where he came from.' 'He was a gentleman, a good and honorable man and an extraordinary public servant. I was honored to know him. I am suspending all campaign activities as we pray for his family and friends.' The North Carolina Republican Party also issued a statement of sympathy. 'We are incredibly shocked and saddened to hear about Keith Crisco’s sudden passing,' the state party said. 'Keith was an accomplished businessman and public servant with a sterling reputation and a tremendous amount of respect from North Carolinians across the partisan spectrum.' Crisco served as secretary of commerce for North Carolina from 2009 to 2013. In that role he was one of the state's . most prolific recruiters of businesses from other states, serving in . the administration of then-Gov. Bev Perdue. Aiken has cast himself as a centrist, and will have to overcome his district's strong bloc of evangelical Christian voters who tend to vote Republican. Has has said previously that he doesn't believe the fact he is gay will affect whether people vote for him. Aiken had been carefully watching the vote-total numbers, spokeswoman Tucker Middleton told the Associated Press. 'It's close, but we're confident,' she said last week. Both candidates were waiting for an official result before deciding whether to request a recount. There weren't enough uncounted ballots to swing the election, but the margin could have narrowed enough to permit a recount request. Crisco had released a statement last Wednesday calling the contest 'still very tight.' 'I want the elections officials to have an opportunity to tally the votes and provide a report on their canvass activities to allow all the campaigns a chance to see the final numbers,' he insisted then. Crisco was a former North Carolina secretary of commerce known for recruiting businesses to the Tarheel State from other U.S. regions . Now the nearly 400 outstanding absentee ballots won't likely matter. The state board of elections also issued a statement of condolence. 'A native of North Carolina, we are grateful for Mr. Crisco’s service to our state and his community through the years,' the statement read. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the Crisco family during this difficult time.' An board employee in Raleigh told MailOnline that it's still possible Crisco could emerge as the official Democratic primary winner. If that should happen, the employee said, it would be up to the state Democratic Party to determine how to proceed with its congressional nomination. But the News and Observer newspaper reported Monday afternoon that Crisco had met with a campaign adviser just hours before his death to discuss conceding the race. Crisco was married for 49 years, and had three children and six grandchildren.","Keith Crisco, a prominent businessman and former state secretary of commerce, reportedly died Monday afternoon at his home .

"By . Joshua Gardner . A California elementary school teacher is being charged with burglary and possession of a controlled substance after authorities allegedly saw surveillance footage that shows her stealing medication from special needs children. Sheri Haselhuhn, a 40-year-old mother and wife with 14 years of teaching experience, is also allegedly seen in the footage swallowing the medication. Police were first alerted by officials at Delta Charter school in Clarksburg on Tuesday after one of the student's medication came up short. Sad: Northern California elementary school teacher Sheri Haselhuhn was arrested Wednesday for allegedly stealing pills from special needs children to take herself . 'On Wednesday afternoon deputies were notified by the school that they had located suspicious activity in the footage they reviewed,'  Yolo County Sheriff Capt. Larry Cecchettinis told the Daily Democrat. 'A deputy responded and reviewed the footage, dated April 28, 2014. It showed Haselhuhn removing the medication and ingesting it.' Haselhuhn was arrested in her West Sacramento home on Wednesday. The medication has not been identified. Nor have authorities revealed whether the student whose medication she stole was a current pupil of Haselhuhn's. Shocking: Haselhuhn was allegedly seen on surveillance tapes opening a locked medicine cabinet and ingesting a pill . Meanwhile, parents of her current and former students expressed their shock and disbelief as news spread of her arrest. 'She taught my son how to read,' Linda McCapes, whose son was taught by Sheri Haselhuhn, told CBS Sacramento. 'She was nice.' The school's principal did what he could to move the focus from Haselhuhn to the students of Delta Elementary Charter. 'I think the most important message to our families is that the safety of our children is No. 1 priority, and we want all our families to know that's why we notified law enforcement and took immediate action,' principal Steve Lewis told CBS News. Haselhuhn was released Thursday on $20,000 bail.Her next court appearance is scheduled for June 9.","Sheri Haselhuhn, 40, of West Sacramento, California is charged with burglary and possession of a controlled substance .

By his side was fifth wife Elizabeth Berrios. She was once his nurse. He married her in 1998. He married her, then divorced - then married her again after his fourth wife, Althea Flynt, drowned in her bathtub in 1976. Flynt ditched his normal power wheelchair and was pushed by a bodyguard . Flynt clearly enjoyed the affection from his younger bride. He recently said he still maintains a sex life thanks to penile implants . Berrios was once Flynt's nurse. She is pictured with him at a book signing in 2013 . Mr Flynt has been confined to a wheelchair since 1976, when he was wounded by a white supremacist gunman. The bullets damaged his spine. He revealed last February that he still has an active sex life - thanks to a penile implant he received. Mr Flynt says he is estranged from all but one of his five children - claiming they only want his money and have no interest in his business empire. Despite Hustler magazine falling dramatically in circulation from its peak of 3million - and dramatically more competition from internet pornography - Mr Flynt claims his smut empire still brings in $100million a year.","Larry Flynt made a rare public appearance on Mother's Day .

The teenage death count in car crash over the weekend in Long Island has now risen to five after one of the survivors who was in critical condition has now been pronounced dead. Nassau County police said four of the teenagers died when the car they were in crashed with a large SUV early Saturday. A fifth teenager- Cody Talanian- was pronounced dead at Nassau University Medical Center on Sunday night, police said. The teens were riding in a 2001 Nissan when it crossed over a double yellow line and collided with a GMC Suburban. Two people in the SUV were seriously injured. Police on Monday identified the teenage fatalities as Jesse J. Romero, 18; Tristan Reichle, 17; Talanian, 17; Noah Tziamihaf who also goes by Noah Franklin, 15, and Carly Lonnborg, 14. A spokesman said the homicide squad had yet to release information on who was driving. Other details about the crash investigation also were not immediately provided. Carly Lonnborg's relatives have launched a Go Fund Me page to help raise money for her funeral. As of early Monday evening, they had raised more than $3,800. 'Carly was the brightest, most beautiful and unique young lady. She was only 14, but in those short years she lived a full vibrant life and touched everyone who was lucky enough to have known her,' the page reads. Grief counselors were sent to Farmingdale High School, where all of the teens were either current of former students. The flag outside the school was flying at half-staff.

"By . Ashley Collman . and Snejana Farberov . The Florida mom accused of murdering her two teen children was 'without a doubt' insane at the time of the slayings, a psychologist testified Monday. However, prosecutors argue that 53-year-old Julie Schenecker knew what she was doing when she shot dead daughter Calyx, 16, and son Beau, 13, in January 2011 - and has simply convinced everyone into believing she's crazy. On Monday, psychologist Dr Eldra Soloman testified for the defense as they seek to acquit Schenecker by proving she's mentally ill. Scroll down for video . Crazy: A psychologist and psychiatrist testified in the trial of Julie Schenecker on Monday, the 53-year-old Florida mom accused of shooting dead her two teen children in 2011. They both agreed that she was insane at the time of the slayings. Pictured Monday in court . After spending 20 hours with Schenecker, and reviewing the accused's medical history, Dr Soloman diagnosed her as bi-polar with psychotic features. 'I think without a doubt that she was insane at the time of the shooting and during the week prior to the shooting,' Dr Solomon told the jury. 'Even psychopaths don't kill their own children.' 'They may be able to kill other people's children, but sane people have it wired in their DNA to protect their children,' she added. Dr Soloman says Schenecker developed severe mental illness after being molested at the age of seven and started to think about suicide when she was just 12 years old. Didn't know it was wrong: Psychologist Dr Eldra Soloman testified Monday saying sane people don't kill their children and that Schenecker believed she was helping them by bringing them to heaven with her . Six months before the killings, Schenecker went off her medications, resulting in a 'downward spiral' which ended with Calyx and Beau's deaths. Around that time, Schenecker started behaving bizarely, telling her therapist that she wanted to get pregnant at the age of 49 so she could immediately give the child up for adoption. Dr Soloman believes Schenecker wanted to commit suicide, but didn't want to leave her children motherless - fearing that her daughter was becoming bi-polar and that her son would be molested just like her. So she decided to kill herself and take 'her children with her to heaven' in order to protect them from the evils of the world. After shooting dead her two children, Schenecker took several pills which put her to sleep - but did not prove lethal. Failed plan: Schenecker planned to kill herself after shooting dead kids Calyx, 16 (left), and Beau, 13 (right). But the prescription pills she took didn't prove fatal and simply put her to sleep. Her husband was deployed in the Middle East at the time. The two have since divorced . Schenecker's husband and the father of her children, Army Col Parker Schenecker, was deployed in the Middle East at the time and the two have since divorced. When she woke up the next morning, Dr Soloman says Schenecker was very upset. 'She said she was very angry at herself because she failed,' Solomon said. 'She was very upset because she didn't succeed at killing herself.' Forensic psychiatrist Dr Michael Maher also testified and agrees that Schenecker was legally insane at the time of the shootings. 'My conclusion is she knew what she was doing ... but she did not know it was wrong. She believed she was protecting her children from something that was terribly horrible; she believed she was going to stay with her children and bring them with her to heaven, and it was a part of her necessary duty as a mother to do this,' Dr Maher said. However, the prosecution has been arguing that the slayings were premeditated, and not the result of a mental breakdown. Julie Schenecker talks with attorney Jennifer Spradley on Tuesday, May 6, 2014 . The jury previously heard recordings of Schenecker telling detectives that her teens were mean and that she hoped they were dead just hours after their bodies were found. 'I just topped over. The last straw,' Schenecker said in the interview, 'My daughter, the 16-year-old, is mouthy. She calls me names.' She told the detective that she had long thought about suicide. 'I feel horrible. I just feel horrible,' she said. 'But I've been thinking about doing this for a long time.' Later, the detective asked her where her kids were. She said that Calyx was in her bed where she had placed her after the shooting, and that Beau was in the family's minivan where she had shot him. 'I hope they're dead,' Schenecker said to police Detective Gary Sandel. 'What do you think?' 'They're dead,' Det Sandel replied. Julie Schenecker is led out of the courtroom on May 9, 2014 . Tampa Police officer Fred Arnold testified that Schenecker's mood was 'jovial' the day of her arrest. 'She wasn't sad or anything like that,' Arnold said. 'She wanted me to give her my gun so she could finish the job.' Schenecker also wrote about her 'disrespectful' children in her journals but Dr Soloman said those were merely 'ramblings'. Schenecker is facing two counts of first-degree murder and has plead not guilty by reason of insanity. If convicted, she will face a life prison sentence without parole; prosecutors declined to seek the death penalty. If acquitted by reason of insanity, the mother would be committed to a hospital until she is no longer a danger to herself or others.","Julie Schenecker, 53, is currently facing two counts of first-degree murder for shooting dead her two children in January 2011 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated  Press Reporter . A 17-year-old girl has pleaded not guilty to nearly a dozen charges stemming from a January crime rampage she embarked on while high on meth, which left both a Utah County sheriff's sergeant and her boyfriend dead. Meagan Grunwald, who is being tried as an adult, spoke quietly in a Provo courtroom on Monday as she entered her pleas against charges of murder, attempted murder and other counts. The teenager is the only surviving suspect from the January 30 police chase and shootout. Her attorney, Dean Zabriskie, told reporters after the arraignment that Grunwald plans to take the stand in her own defense at trial and will testify that her 27-year-old boyfriend forced her at gunpoint to participate in the crime rampage. 'I'm not guilty': Megan Grunwald, 17, is facing life in prison on a dozen charges for the shooting death of a sheriff's deputy in Utah, but has told a court that her boyfriend - who died in the ensuing chase - forced her at gunpoint to take part in the January crime rampage . Life: Grunwald is 17, which makes her ineligible for the death penalty, but prosectors say she is culpable enough to be charged with murder, even if she didn't pull the trigger. If convicted, she faces up to life in prison . Unprovoked: Utah County Sheriff's Deputy Cory . Wride was shot dead by Grunwald's boyfriend after trying to help the . couple, who he thought was having car troubles . Crime couple: The chase ended when sheriff's . deputies shot Jose Angel Garcia-Juaregui (left) in the head and his . girlfriend Grunwald (right)  was arrested. Garcia-Juaregui died the . following day in the hospital. Grunwald is now facing all the charges, but has pleaded not guilty . Prosecutors say Angel Garcia-Juaregui is the one who shot Utah County Sheriff's Sgt. Cory Wride and another deputy. But they argue Grunwald drove the couple during the chase in a pickup truck registered to the teenager and her mother. Investigators also have said Grunwald participated in the crimes, including a carjacking. Garcia-Juaregui, a fugitive, died from injuries he sustained in a shootout with police shortly before law enforcement arrested the pair. During the crime spree, Grunwald was intimidated, coerced and 'scared to death', Zabriskie said. 'We mourn, as the whole community does, for this dead police officer, and the other one that was horribly injured,' Zabriskie said. 'But we just don't see that our client is responsible for that and we think the evidence will prove that.' Chief Deputy Utah County Attorney Tim Taylor said after court Monday that his office has not discussed the possibility of a plea deal with the teenager's attorneys, who are reviewing thousands of documents of evidence that prosecutors have shared. 'We obviously know that she was there. We know that she participated,' he said. 'But should there be some sort of plea offer in that case, that's something we're going to be looking at.' End of the road: The hours-long chase on January 30 finally . came to an end when the couple's hijacked car hit a second set of spikes . and they crashed . Grunwald's relatively young age is something they'll consider when making a decision about a plea deal, Taylor said. 'She's a young girl. But we know that young people can still do horrific crimes,' he said. Justice: Police were finally able to stop the truck, which was driven the whole time by Grunwald, with a road spike . Taylor said if prosecutors consider a plea deal, they will discuss it with Wride's family first. At a two-day hearing in April, prosecutors played dash-cam videos from about half a dozen officers involved in the pursuit along snowy highways in central Utah. Prosecutors with the Utah County Attorney's Office also presented telephone records that showed Grunwald called her mother during the chase, but neither the teenager nor her mother called 911. Grunwald is facing charges under Utah laws that make participating in and assisting with a crime nearly as serious as committing it. Besides murder and attempted murder, Grunwald is charged with obstructing justice, aggravated robbery and use of a controlled substance. The teenager tested positive for methamphetamine after the chase, court records show. A day before the chase, an arrest warrant had been issued for Garcia-Juaregui that alleged violations of his parole conditions. He was paroled from a Utah prison in December 2012 after serving 4 1/2 years for attempted homicide. Attempted murder: Garcia-Juaregui also shot at . Deputy Greg Sherwood (pictured with wife Gina above) and critically . injured him . Recovery: Sherwood spent 19 days in hospital but was finally allowed to go home on Tuesday . Grunwald could face 25 years to life in prison if convicted. She is ineligible for the death penalty because she is under 18. Documents filed in court earlier this year shed light on the dramatic crime spree that ended in two deaths on the I-15 roadway. Wride stopped to help Grunwald and her boyfriend around 1pm because he thought they were having car trouble and wanted to help. Grunwald . was driving the car with her boyfriend in the passenger's seat. She . gave Wride her driver's license but Garcia-Juearegui gave the officer a . false name. Wride went . back and forth between the pick-up truck registered to Grunwald's mother . and his squad car three times, trying to figure out Garcia-Juaregui's . actual identity. It was . while sitting in his squad car that Garcia-Juaregui opened the rear . window of the truck's cab and started shooting at the officer and his . girlfriend sped off. Wride died and his body wasn't found until 45 minutes later when another deputy was sent out to check up on him. Fellow deputy Greg Sherwood tracked the couple's truck down around 3pm and attempted to pull the couple over. But . Grunwald wouldn't stop, and actually 'aggressively applied the brakes' to shorten the distance between the two vehicles while her boyfriend . started shooting. Mourning: Family, friends and fellow police officers attend the funeral of Cory Wride in Spanish Ford Cemetery on February 5 . Tragic loss: Wride's wife Nanette (right) is comforted by her son Shea at the funeral . Garcia-Juregui . hit Sherwood in the head, critically injuring the officer. Sherwood . eventually recovered from the injury and returned home Tuesday after . spending 19 days in the hospital. After hitting Sherwood, the couple hit . another roadblock when their truck crashed after hitting spikes laid on . the road near Nephi, Utah. Instead . of surrendering to police, Grunwald helped flagged down a minivan and . her boyfriend carjacked the vehicle from a woman who was on her way home . from a parent-teacher conference. This . is just one of the instances prosecutors are using to argue that . Grunwald was not being forced by her boyfriend to take part in the crime . spree. After abandoning the . truck, prosecutors say Grunwald 'on her own accord, follows Mr . Garcia-Juaregui after leaving the vehicle without appearing to be . coerced by him'. Police allege Grunwald was high on meth when she . and her boyfriend shot and killed a sheriff's deputy who was trying to . help them with car trouble last mont. She is seen here at a court appearance in February . The couple didn't get far with the hijacked car and crashed again on a second strip of spikes. After hitting the spikes, police say Grunwald crossed into traffic and tried to strike another vehicle on purpose. Juab County sheriff's deputies were finally able to stop the couple when they shot Garcia-Juaregui in the head. While he was lying on the ground, Grunwald yelled at officers: 'You f****** shot him'. A trial will be scheduled at a June 2 . hearing. Attorneys say they expect the trial will take about three weeks . and will be scheduled for late summer or early fall of this year.","Megan Grunwald has pleaded not guilty to a dozen charges for a fatal car chase in Utah on January 30 .

"By . Damien Gayle . If you want to buy one of these wallet-busting pizzas, you're going to need plenty of dough. Steveston Pizza in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada, sell a range of pizzas piled high with rare seafood. Nader Hatami, the restaurant's owner and head chef, says the $450 price tag shouldn't put customers off his costly creations. Steveston Pizza owner and chef Nader Hatami poses with one of his pricey pizzas, which come topped with ingredients including lobster Thermidor, smoked black Alaskan cod, creme fraiche and Russian Osetra caviar . 'It's not your usual Friday night pizza,' he said. 'I just kept on going with the ingredients and I've sold about eight of these so far. 'All Steveston pizzas are made with fresh, specialty ingredients however for those that like to go to the next level in flavours there are a few extra special pies.' The C6 pizza is topped with Thermidor of lobster, smoked black Alaskan cod, crème fraîche and a side order of Russian Osetra caviar. 'It's not your usual Friday night pizza': Mr Hatami says the $460 price shouldn't put customers off his creation . Beautifully presented: Indeed, despite its cost, his are not the most expensive pizzas available, by far . 'I just kept on going with the ingredients and I've sold about eight of these so far,' said Mr Hatami . Mr Hatami's creation is far from the world's most expensive pizza, however. That accolade belongs to Margo's Pizzeria in Malta, which in 2010 reportedly sold a pizza for a massive $2,380. The thin crust came topped with white truffles, 24-carat gold leaf and buffalo mozzarella . While reliable rankings are hard to come by, second place may go to Nino's Bellissima Pizza in Manhattan, New York City, which claimed it had a huge hit with a £1,000 effort which came stacked with $820-worth of caviar. Nino's owner, Nino Selimaj, said at the time that hundreds of wealthy New Yorkers had already snapped up the decadent dish, which included both Beluga and Black Russian Royal Sevruga caviars as toppings. 'People who know about their caviar love this pizza,' he said. 'We sell them to politicians, Wall Street traders, or couples celebrating a birthday or anniversary.' Unassuming: The location of Steveston Pizza in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada . So Mr Hatami has some way to go before he's battling the big boys in the niche market for pricey pizzas, but he's stepping up his game. For Canadian food-lovers with serious money to burn, Steveston Pizza is now set to release an even more expensive version, the C7, which will cost a whopping $750. It contains all of the ingredients from the C6 pizza but adds an additional topping of luxury white truffle carpaccio shavings. All pizzas are divided into 10 slices, giving each piece a jaw-dropping price tag of $75 each. But hungry pizza lovers must order their high brow meals one day in advance before they can pick them up.","'It's not your usual Friday night pizza,' says chef and owner Nader Hatami .

"Many of the ads included quotes from 'expert European doctors' who endorsed Lysol as a contraceptive . By . Margot Peppers . It may sound unbelievable now, but there was a time when douching with Lysol was the most popular form of contraceptive. Despite the fact that the antiseptic soap was ineffective and sometimes caused vaginal burns, inflammation and even death, ads in the Twenties and Thirties continually pushed it as a safe and gentle method of birth control, even up until the Fifties. One such ad describes Lysol as 'the perfect antiseptic for marriage hygiene,' claiming: 'The fact that it is used as an . antiseptic in childbirth is evidence that it is safe and mild enough for . even the most sensitive female membranes.' How times have changed: It may sound unbelievable now, but there was a time when douching with Lysol was the most popular form of contraceptive, aggressively marketed as 'safe' and 'mild' The method is also alluded to in an episode of Boardwalk Empire in which Nucky's mistress Margaret Schroeder is seen concealing a pregnancy prevention kit. Today, of course, a bottle of Lysol - which is commonly used as a toilet cleaner and disinfectant - comes with warnings on the label that read 'flammable' and 'for external use only'. But in the days when contraception and abortion were illegal and seen as deplorable, Lysol was viewed as a cheap and easy solution which could be purchased over the counter. The Lysol of the Twenties and Thirties contained much more potent ingredients than the Lysol of today, with chemicals that caused irritation and burning. According to Andrea Tone's 2001 book Devices and Desires: A History of Contraceptives in America, it was completely ineffective as a contraceptive. Convenient: In the days when contraception and abortion were illegal, Lysol was viewed as a cheap and easy post-coital solution which could be purchased over the counter . Deadly concoction: Not only was the antiseptic soap an ineffective form of birth control, but it was also harmful and sometimes caused vaginal burns, inflammation and even death . In fact, in a 1933 study, nearly half of the 507 participants who used Lysol as a form of birth control ended up falling pregnant. 'Manufacturers would use euphemisms to refer to birth control. They took advantage of consumers' hopes' What's more, according to MotherJones.com, by 1911 doctors had recorded 193 poisonings caused by Lysol and five deaths from uterine irrigation. Still, advertisers continued to encourage its use, aggressively marketing it as gentle and safe and using the terms 'marriage hygiene' and 'feminine hygiene' as euphemisms. One of the ads from that era calls Lysol a 'certain' way to 'destroy germs in the presence of organic matter.' Fraudulent: Advertisers used the terms 'marriage hygiene' and 'feminine hygiene' as euphemisms and quoted 'expert doctors' endorsing Lysol who did not even exist . The ad continues: 'For years Lysol has been the choice of hospitals and clinics, for every surgical purpose, even in the delicate operations attending childbirth.' It concludes with a doctor's endorsement of the antiseptic: 'I prescribe its regular use in marriage hygiene for the health and peace of mind of every wife.' Later investigation by the American Medical Association found that the many European doctors quoted as experts in these ads did not even exist. Firmly in the past: Douching with Lysol (pictured in its modern form) was the most common form of birth control until 1960, when the oral contraceptive pill was introduced on the market . 'The fraud of the Lysol douche was a byproduct of illegality,' Dr Tone writes in her book. 'Because birth control couldn't be advertised openly, manufacturers would use euphemisms to refer to birth control. They took advantage of consumers' hopes.' Douching with Lysol was the most common form of birth control until 1960, when the oral contraceptive pill was introduced on the market.","Many of the ads included quotes from 'expert European doctors' who endorsed Lysol as a contraceptive .

"By . Steph Cockroft . As far as attempts for breaking world records go, this event in Bali surely has to be one of the most stress-free. One thousand masseurs from all over Indonesia gathered at Sanur Beach to set a new world record for the largest-ever mass massage. Lying on palmyra leaf mats, with the beautiful Indonesian coastline as the backdrop, 1,000 lucky participants were continuously massaged for 15 minutes in a bid to land the new record title. And relax: One thousand masseurs have broken the world record for the largest simultaneous massage. The successful attempt took place at a beach in Sanur, Bali, Indonesia . The event was organised to beat the previous world record held by masseurs in Bangkok, Thailand, who carried out 641 simultaneous massages in July last year . The record-breaking challenge was called 'Two thousand therapists' hands in traditional Indonesian massage' and saw the masseurs carry out the treatments for 15 minutes . The event, which saw therapists travel from Bali, Central Java and East Java to take part, broke the previous world record which had been set in July last year in Bangkok, Thailand. During that world record attempt, 641 masseurs had carried out continuous treatments for 12 minutes. Wayan . Sudani, 38, one of the spa therapists, said participating . in the event in Bali had been a rare opportunity. She said: 'Moreover, we got a certificate . for participating in the event. I am really proud to be part of it.' Mother-of-three Ketut . Kamiasih, another masseur taking part, said: 'I am really happy took . part in this event and am glad I could. 'Many therapist failed to . participate because they only needed 1,000 therapists.' The 1,000 participants were asked to lie on palmyra leaf mats while their masseurs, who were dressed in matching purple and blue outfits, carried out their work . The masseurs came from Bali, Central Java and East Java to take part in the record-breaking attempt . Many therapists were unable to take part in the challenge because only 1,000 masseurs were needed . At the event, the therapists - who were dressed in matching purple and blue outfits - were later divided into groups giving nine types of treatments. Those included Javanese lulur, which is a body scrub, a Balinese boreh, which is a body mask and Bugis tellu sulapa eppa, another body scrub. There were also herbal steam baths, traditional saunas, exfoliation treatment susing egg protein, detoxifying rituals and steam treatments. Russel Collins, an Australian who volunteered to take part in the record-breaking attempt, said: 'It’s wonderful. I like Balinese massage. “In Australia, we have to pay $80 to $90, while in Bali we can have one for only $30.' Indonesian Museum of Records (MURI) founder Jaya Suprana said the event - part of the 'Wonderful Adventure Indonesia: Asia Pacific Hash 2014 initiative' - had broken the world record, based on the last world record held in Thailand. She presented a MURI certificate to the Tourism and Creative Economy Minister Mari Elka Pangestu. She said: 'We should be proud that we’ve broken the world record. 'Thank you for agreeing to be massaged by our therapists. For all participating therapists, we sincerely thank you and are very proud of you. You do excellent work. Thank you for your wonderful hands.'

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Only last week, Karlie Kloss was partying the night away at the Met Gala, and she's still staying up late - but this time with her study books. The 20-year-old Victoria's Secret Angel revealed on Instagram that she is taking part in a program at Harvard Business School. 'I am very excited to be spending a few days here on the Harvard Campus in Cambridge for a class this week', she wrote alongside a photo of herself posing next to a statue of the University’s founder, John Harvard. Not just a pretty face: Supermodel Karlie Kloss, pictured posing with the University's founder, has been taking part in a week-long program at the Harvard Business School . According to The New York Post, she has been studying 'The Business of Entertainment, Media and Sports’. On completion of the program, Miss Kloss will receive a certificate, which will no doubt delight the model, as she has been talking about her hopes of studying at the illustrious Ivy League University for some time. The statuesque Vogue favorite told The Daily last year that she would like to focus on business so she can learn how to 'run a successful company'. A different sort of all-nighter: Miss Kloss, who shared this Instagram snap captioned 'late night in the library', is said to be studying 'The Business of Entertainment, Media and Sports' And it was fellow supermodel Tyra Banks who inspired her to consider courses at the Boston-based institution. Ms Banks, 40, completed a nine-week entrepreneurial program at Harvard in 2012. 'Tyra [Banks] did it... I can do it, too,' Miss Kloss explained. Future entrepreneur? Karlie Kloss, pictured at last week's Met Gala, has expressed interest in learning more about the business world, after launching her own venture, Karlie's Cookies, two years ago . It is likely that the American-born beauty has also been consulting her tech investor boyfriend, Josh Kushner, on the subject. Mr Kushner, 28, graduated from Harvard in 2008 and stayed on to complete the school's business prestigious MBA program in 2011. Talking about her future, Chicago-born Miss Kloss, who is now based in New York, said: 'I feel fortunate to have an incredible . career and experiences behind me but there is so much more that I want . to do with this career and with my life. 'I feel fortunate to have an incredible . career but there is so much more that I want . to do with my life' 'Now that I am getting more and more . involved in these entrepreneurial projects I think business is something . that would also be fascinating. 'To have a better understanding of economics and business, and the way to run a successful company.' Proving her business acumen, she launched a gluten-free cookie product called Karlie's Kookies at New York Fashion Week two years ago, in collaboration with popular Manhattan bakery Momofuku Milk Bar. Proceeds raised from the sweet treats benefited hungry children around the world and the cookies are still available online for $22 a tin. Inspiration: Tyra Banks (pictured) completed a nine-week program at Harvard Business School two years ago, and it she who Miss Kloss quoted as her inspiration . Other than business, Miss Kloss said that she has always had an interest in medicine as her father is an emergency room doctor. Tyra Banks previously said that she found her $100,000 program at Harvard tough going at times. 'I think they make it hard on purpose. Once you get done reading one assignment, you get another,' she complained. A string of models have demonstrated that they have brains as well as beauty. Christy Turlington earned a degree in Eastern religion and philosophy from NYU, while Lily Cole famously scored a double first in History of Art at the University of Cambridge.","Supermodel is said to be taking a week-long course on 'the business of entertainment, media and sports'

"By . Adam Duggan . While shooting their television programme on location, an Australian film crew managed to record more than they initially expected on New Zealand’s South Island. On April 3, an Australian-produced art show were filming their opening sequence in Queenstown, completely unaware of what was happening in the background. But while editing the episode over the past week, Colour In Your Life presenter Graeme Stevenson noticed something paranormally strange – what he believes to be two UFOs. Scroll down for video . Picturesque location, paranormal happenings: Colour In Your Life's production manager said the team didn't notice the flying objects until editing the footage they came across . Noting the similarities between what they came across and a video Mr Stevenson had seen of a UFO sighting filmed in the Netherlands, the presenter believed they were on to something. When the production team took a closer look, they were blown away. ‘We were all like, what was that?’ Colour In Your Life production manager Tanita Cree told MailOnline. After slowing down the footage, the questions turned into what they should do with their caught on camera UFO sighting. Flying from the trees: The team noticed the disks fly out from the trees, hover briefly, then disappear into the sky . ‘It was the speed they were moving at, they just jumped out of the trees,’ Ms Cree said. After slowing down the video and watching it frame by frame, the two shapes can be seen emerging from the trees, moving up into the sky and then disappearing. All this managed to take place before a motorcyclist, also in the shot's background, rode cross the bridge they were filming near. Certain that what they'd captured was a UFO, the team decided to post the video online and 'see what everyone thought.' Faster than a motorbike: The alleged UFOs disappear before the motorcyclist has finished crossing the bridge . 'From the trees to where I was on the bike is about a half a kilometer, if you look at the speed in real time that means that if it were birds they would have accelerated to about 4,000 kilometers an hour in one second,' a member of the production team posted on their Facebook page. The video that confirmed Colour In Your Life presenter Graeme Stevenson's initial impression that what they filmed was potentially a UFO had been filmed in the Netherlands by Maassluis resident Dick Smits at approximately 3pm on Friday April 11. Maassluis is about 23 kilometres south of The Hague, at the mouth of the Rhine River. According to Rijnmond TV News, Mr Smits was filming a boat in the canal below his apartment when he noticed the strange looking object in the sky.","Australian film crew allegedly capture UFO sighting in New Zealand .

"By . Sam Webb . Nick Gargan, the Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Police, has been suspended while an investigation into a number of serious allegations that relate to inappropriate conduct towards female members of staff at the force takes place . A police chief has been suspended while claims of inappropriate behaviour towards female officers and staff are investigated. A number of 'serious allegations' against Avon and Somerset Police chief constable Nick Gargan have been made, police and crime commissioner (PCC) Sue Mountstevens said.

"By . Paul Donnelley . Rishi Khatau weighed a huge seven stone in September last year. The boy was wearing men's shirts and his waist measured 36"" A four-year-old boy in India was so fat his parents allowed surgeons to cut away 70 per cent of his stomach to lose weight. Rishi Khatau weighed seven stone in September last year and his parents, Dipen and Henna Khatau, claimed they had tried everything to curb his eating. The toddler was so big that he was wearing adult sized shirts and his trouser waist was a huge 36 inches. Eventually they felt they had no choice but to pay a clinic to make his stomach smaller – in an operation called a gastrectomy – making him one of the youngest patients in the world to undergo such an operation. Mr Khatau, 39, a textile trader, from Calcutta, in West Bengal, India, said: ‘We had no other way of saving our son. He was slowly dying and we had tried diets and failed. The doctor told us his condition was serious, surgery was our last hope.’ When Rishi was born he weighed just 3lbs 9ozs and his parents spent the next 12 months lovingly over feeding him to build his weight and strength. ‘He was a tiny baby so we felt we had to feed him extra to compensate,’ Dipen said. ‘By his first birthday he was a healthy weight for his age and we were thankful but six months later we started to notice he was getting bigger.’ By his second birthday Rishi already weighed three stone. Mr and Mrs Khatau started to worry and halved his food portions but Rishi would cry for more food, often screaming he was hungry. When he was born Rishi weighed 3lb 9oz so his parents fed him to fatten him up but found that he could not stop eating and ballooned to seven stone by the time he was four . Mr Khatau remembered: ‘He was so fat he could only sleep lying down for ten minutes before he’d wake up in the night. He had severe breathing issues and he was always gasping for breath. We feared he wouldn’t be alive for his next birthday.’ Eventually they decided to take Rishi to see a doctor. The doctor diagnosed Rishi with Prader Willi syndrome that meant his body was unable to burn calories properly. ‘The doctor told us to put him on a strict diet and encourage him to do daily physical exercises but it didn’t work. He’d beg and beg for more food. He always wanted more and being good and caring parents we gave him what he wanted. ‘He never felt satisfied with his meals; it baffled us. Dipen and Henna Khatau with their two children: Rishi and his nine-year-old sister Janvi . ‘I don’t think we were to blame. I don’t think we did anything wrong by giving him food.’ During a family function last year a relative told Mr Khatau about bariatric surgery. ‘She’d had it done and lost lots of weight,’ Mr Khatau added. ‘She said it was a success and recommended a doctor to us. We’d never heard of it but if it worked for her then it could work for Rishi so we looked into it.’ Mrs Khatau, 34, a housewife, said: ‘I hated being so scared that my son wouldn’t see his next birthday. I was terrified all the time. We had to do something to save him. ‘As a mother I loved carrying him around but he was just so heavy. Every morning he’d hate walking to the school bus because he wasn’t able to move fast so I’d carry him. I felt so much lighter when I put him down. We had to help our son.’ So Mr and Mrs Khatau made an appointment at the Asian Bariatric Hospital, in Ahmedabad, western India. Mrs Khatau said: ‘The doctor told us that we had no choice but to give him this operation, it was our last resort.’ Rish's weight has dropped and he can now play games with his family and friends . The couple, who already has a nine-year-old daughter Janvi, were terrified of making the wrong decision. Gastrectomy is a drastic alternative to a gastric band or bypass surgery – none of which would ever be carried out on pre-teen children in the UK. Mr Khatau said: ‘Our friends and family were very supportive because they knew how much we’d tried to control his eating and to help him lose weight. They thought we should go ahead with it. But we were so scared of the surgery going wrong.’ Eventually they committed to a decision. Prader–Willi syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that was first described in 1956 by Swiss doctors Andrea Prader (1919–2001), Heinrich Willi (1900–1971), Alexis Labhart (1916–1994), Andrew Ziegler, and Guido Fanconi (1892-1979). Symptoms include low muscle tone, shortness of height, incomplete sexual development, cognitive disabilities, behavioural problems, and a chronic feeling of hunger that can lead to excessive eating and life-threatening obesity. With behavioural therapy and other treatments, its effects can be reduced. In September last year Rishi was admitted to the Asian Bariatric Hospital and Dr Mahendra Narwaria performed a two-hour operation where 70 per cent of the boy’s stomach was removed. The surgery cost R300,000 (£3,000) and Mr Khatau used his savings to pay for the operation. ‘Rishi had no idea what was going on, we just told him the doctors were going to drill two holes in his stomach and check where he was hiding all the Jalebi,’ Mrs Khatau added: ‘But we were so scared. Those two hours felt like a day. We comforted each other, and we tried to be strong; and we prayed to God to keep our little boy alive.’ After surgery Rishi was taken to intensive care for three days. But when he woke he started a liquid diet and lost seven pounds within the first month. ‘We saw a change in his sleep almost immediately. He could finally experience a peaceful night’s sleep, we were over the moon,’ Mrs Khatau said. For the next four months Rishi stuck to a semi-sold diet including Dal soup and juice. And now, six months on, he weights five stone, is sleeping throughout the night, playing cricket and cycling with his friends. Mr Khatau said: ‘It makes me very happy that my son is losing the weight and getting his life back. I was terrified we’d made the wrong decision going for the surgery but now we know it was the right choice. I see my son swimming, cycling and running and enjoying life again. That is a wonderful feeling.’ But Rishi still has days when he craves his favourite Jalebis. Mrs Khatau added: ‘He still has a craving for sweets and chocolates. Whenever he sees other children eating, he wants the same. So now we make him share his food, that way he’s having what he wants but only half the actual portion.’ Dr Mahendra Narwaria, from the Asian Bariatric Hospital, in Ahmedabad, said: ‘I would say it’s better for such young children to be put on a strict diet and learn a healthy lifestyle but surgery was the only option left for this boy. ‘I never suggested a diet for this family because they’d already tried it, had already seen a number of doctors and nothing had helped.’ This was Dr Narwaria’s first gastrectomy operation on a child so young and admits there were risks. ‘This child was dying and we all knew the risks involved but he was in a serious condition. We had to take this extreme measure. And now he’s recovered well; he’s lost the weight and he’s playing games, going to school and is a happier child.’ Rishi, now five, has another stone to lose before he’s classed a normal weight for a child his age but his life has already been transformed.’ Mr Khatau said: ‘I had never heard of such surgery before this experience. We’d tried diets, we’d tried everything. Even though surgery is a risk we had no other option to save our son. He was dying. ‘We’re not a lazy or greedy family; we’re all pretty slim. We just hope that Rishi’s appetite doesn’t grow again as he grows older. We would prefer for him not to have any more surgery.’","At birth Rishi weighed just 3lb 9oz so his parents fed him to fatten him up .

"By . Wills Robinson . and Sebastian Shakespeare . Dan Grabiner, 24, married Lucy Barber, 38, after the pair met at one London's most prestigious schools . A female teacher at one of London's prestigious schools resigned after meeting a male pupil and went on to marry him. Geography teacher Lucy Barber left the £22,000-a-year St Paul's School in Barnes, West London, after meeting Daniel Grabiner, who is 14 years her junior. He is also the son of top barrister Lord Grabiner QC, who is head of One Essex Court Chambers in London. The pair are now are now living in a semi-detached house worth £1.4million in London and have a child together. Mr Grabiner went on to study at Magdalene College, Cambridge, while Mrs Barber is said to have been employed at another school. A former pupil of the school told the Daily Mail: 'When we heard that they were officially together it was quite a scandal as she was a teacher and so much older.' 'It was a bit of a shock for the family at first, but they've got used to it since Dan and Lucy married and had a baby,' a friend of the family said. A spokesman for St Paul's confirmed the pair are now married. They added: 'The pupil left in 2007 and the teacher resigned in 2008 to do a drama course. We are unaware of any allegations being raised at this time.' Chancellor of the Exchequer George . Osborne is among the former pupils of St Paul's, which was established . in 1509 and is considered one of the leading schools in the country. According to its website, fees are . £10,411 for a term of boarding and £6,951 per term of days. An Ofsted . inspection in March 2013 described quality of learning at the school as . 'exceptional'. Daniel's father, Lord Grabiner QC, who was involved in the sale of Liverpool Football Club, is the head of the prestigious One Essex Court chambers in London . Mr Grabiner, who now works as a . production developer for ITV, told Mail Online he did not have any . comment to make about the story. The revelation comes after a deputy head at a leading private girls’ school has been . forced to resign because of an affair with a former pupil. Phil . Culling, 41, became romantically involved with 19-year-old Helena . Skelly, an aspiring singer who left Godolphin and Latymer school last . summer. Parents received an email from Headmistress Ruth . Mercer informing them Mr Culling had ‘resigned his position as deputy . head with immediate effect’ because his role had become ‘untenable’. St Paul’s and its junior division, Colet Court has recently been mired by a historic child abuse scandal. The Metropolitan Police began looking into claims after a number of pupils from the 1960s and 1980s came forward with new information. The allegations were apparently focused on accusations from a number of former pupils that eight former schoolmasters sexually abused dozens of young boys between the mid-1960s and last year. The victims are thought to have been aged between nine and 17, and were abused in dormitories, classrooms, a swimming pool, inside a car, and at a teachers' homes. Classics teacher Anthony Fuggle, 57, resigned his post after he was arrested and bailed on suspicion of possession of indecent images. In February, former St Paul’s master Patrick Marshall, 65, was arrested on suspicion of indecently assaulting a pupil in the 1970s. He denies any wrongdoing. The pair met at the £22,000-a-year St Paul's School in Barnes, West London. Mr Grabiner is 14 years her junior . St Paul's, which looks across the Thames, boasts a number of . alumni who have gone into positions of prominence. Poet John Milton, who wrote Paradise Lost, was one of the first pupils of note to attend the London school. Samuel Pepys, a naval administrator famous for the diary he kept . between 1660 and 1669, was educated there in the mid-17th century. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne was a pupil . before going on to study at Magdalen College, Oxford. Ed Vaizey, the Tory Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries, is also a former pupil. Actor Rory Kinnear, who starred in Skyfall and Quantum of Solace, .

"By . Ashley Collman . Video of an 8-year-old girl's heartbreaking account of being bullied has gone viral, garnering more than 22,000 views in just a 24-hour period. Sarah Cymbaluk filmed her daughter Anna's testimony after getting frustrated with the inaction of administrators at Magelsson Elementary School in Fosston, Minnesota. Now, the third-grader is hoping to leverage the outpouring of support for the video to raise awareness of bullying across the U.S. Scroll down for video . Targeted: Anna Cymbaluk, 8, talks about being bullied in a video that was posted on Facebook last week and has since gone viral . Mrs Cymbaluk first posted the video on her Facebook page last week, and Anna is so traumatized from the bullying that she refuses to talk about specifics of the attacks. Instead, mom asks Anna how she feels about being targeted by bullies. 'It makes me feel sad and scared and I don't like it,' the little girl says. Her little brother Benjamin, 7, also appears in the video with stories of his own. He claims bullies told him he was going to commit suicide, and have called him both a 'son of a b****' and a 'motherf****. More abuse: Anna's brother Benjamin (pictured together on the left) also appears in the video and talks about how bullies have called him a 'son of a b****' and a 'motherf*****' In the video, Anna says she's reported the abuse to the principal about five times and has been told to 'just ignore it'. But she thinks the kids behind the attacks should get suspended. 'It hurts my feelings,' she says. 'I want to feel like I'm wanted in school and people like me.' Mrs Cymbaluk told WDAZ her daughter has been called the f-word and a lesbian and that the abuse has even become physical as Anna has come home with scratches and bruises. School officials finally took the reports seriously after Mrs Cymbaluk posted the video on Facebook last week and it immediately swept the internet. Addressing the issue: Sarah and Jon Cymbaluk had a meeting with school administrators after posting the video last week and demanded a written apology . Mrs Cymbaluk and her husband Jon met with the school superintendent, principal and a school board member on Thursday, but don't think the meeting went well. The parents say the first thing one of the officials said was 'What are you going to do to make us look good.' The Cymbaluks demanded a written apology at the meeting, which officials agreed to. However, Superintendent Mark Nohner says he wasn't informed about the bullying until the video was was posted, despite the Cymbaluk's claims that they've been dealing with the school since December. Unaware: School Superintendent Mark Nohner says he hadn't heard about the bullying until last week, but is now doing everything in his power to make Anna feel safe . 'I found out about the situation a couple of days ago and I think it could have been resolved without going to Facebook,' Mr Nohner told KXJB. Mr Nohner says they are now doing everything to make Anna feel safe, and have since spoken with her bus driver. Little Anna is now hoping to help other kids who have been the victim of bullying by organizing an awareness event. Her 9th birthday is on Tuesday and she is asking everyone to wear orange, her favorite color, to honor 'ANYONE in ANY SITUATION who has been bullied' so that they know they are not alone, according to Facebook.

"By . James Rush . Teachers have been told to stop using Second World War gas masks and helmets from the First World War as classroom props because they could contain asbestos. The Health and Safety Executive has advised schools to destroy or make safe the artefacts following tests to look for asbestos fibres and advice from the Imperial War Museum. Historians and teachers' groups have said while pupils' safety is paramount, the artefacts are an important aid for teaching pupils about the Home Front and it would be 'terrible' if those which could be made safe were destroyed. The Health and Safety Executive has advised schools to stop using Second World War gas masks and helmets from the First World War as teaching aids because they could contain asbestos (file picture) In a letter to schools, the HSE said the artefacts should be double-bagged and destroyed unless a licensed contractor could make them safe. The letter said: 'Schools that have any of these items of war memorabilia that are . suspected to contain asbestos should remove them from use. 'They . should be double bagged in plastic which should be taped shut, . appropriately labelled and securely stored while arrangements are made . for either disposal through your Local Authority’s licensed disposal . site, or made safe by a licensed contractor by for example encapsulation . such that they can be safety displayed e.g. in an appropriate labelled . cabinet.' The advice comes after the HSE carried out tests on vintage gas masks, the majority of which contained asbestos in the filters, often the more dangerous crocidolite, or blue asbestos. The HSE said only a minority of those tested did not contain asbestos and it was not possible to say which models do, or do not, contain asbestos. It also received advice from the Imperial War Museum which said their policy was to assume any gas mask contained asbestos and so should not be worn and only handled if certified as safe. Historians and teachers' groups have said the artefacts are an important aid for teaching pupils about the Home Front. Pictured are children wearing gas masks at school during the second world war . The museum also said the majority of the British Army 'Brodie' helmets, issued during the First World War, contained chrysotile, or white asbestos, in the liner. Paula Kitching, of the Historical Association, which supports history teachers in secondary and further education, said while pupils' safety was paramount, it would be 'terrible' if the artefacts were destroyed when they could be made safe. She said: 'Schools shouldn't panic if they have any of these items, they should hand them into museums and then the museums can ensure they are treated properly. 'It would be terrible if all these . artefacts from the First and Second World Wars were destroyed if there . was a way of making them safe' - Paula Kitching, of the Historical Association . 'We wouldn't want schools to panic but the report indicates that the materials can be made safe and if that is the case then we would advise schools to hand them in.' Ms Kitching said the gas masks and helmets were most likely to be part of handling collections at museums. She said: 'It is unlikely, not impossible, but unlikely the schools will have them themselves, so it would be up to the local museums to decide how to make them safe.' She said: 'It would be terrible if all these artefacts from the First and Second World Wars were destroyed if there was a way of making them safe.' Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign For Real Education, said the artefacts were a valuable teaching aid. He said: 'My view is that they are important to keep and of course they need to be safe and I would say we do not wish to see all of these things destroyed because if we start destroying gas masks then we will end up destroying half the artefacts in museums across the world because they are full of weapons. 'They need to be made safe if there is a question about safety, but they shouldn't, in my view, be destroyed.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Ed Miliband's promise to guarantee patients a GP appointment within 48 hours could cost £3billion, doctors warned today. Labour has set aside just £100million to pay for the policy, launched last night to bolster support as polls put the Tories ahead for the first time in two years. Today the Royal College of GPs said the £3billion would need to be found from elsewhere in the NHS to reverse the 'erosion' of funding to local surgeries over recent years. Labour leader Ed Miliband announced plans to guarantee patients can get an appointment with their GP within 48 hours . In a speech last night Mr Miliband said it was a ‘scandal’ that many patients have to wait days to be seen by a GP, and said his party would plough hundreds of millions of pounds into cutting waiting times. He claimed the £100million a year needed to fund shorter waiting times would be found by cutting back on NHS red tape and highly-paid consultants. But Maureen Baker, chairman of the RCGP, said the money was not enough to fulfil the pledge. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'The £100 million is a start and it’s a welcome start. It’s not actually anywhere near enough to give any sort of guarantee. 'When you look at it, it’s around about £10,000 per practice. It certainly won’t go anywhere near employing at practice level more nurses, more GPs. 'At the moment the share of NHS funding that goes to general practice is just over 8 per cent. We see about 90 per cent of all NHS consultations. We believe that our share should be around about 11 per cent.' She said this was the equivalent of 'a rebalancing of  £3billion because that is the share of the NHS budget that historically came to general practice that let us provide the service that patients value and want'. Dr Baker added: 'That funding has been eroded over the years and we need to be able to balance NHS funding to deliver a proper general practice service.' Labour claimed that the number of patients who see a doctor within 48 hours has dropped from 80 per cent to 40 per cent under the Coalition, with one in four people have to wait a week to be seen. Mr Miliband visited Leighton Hospital in Crewe ahead of his policy launch, which has since been criticised for a lack of funding . Mr Miliband said his ‘guarantee’ would prevent patients who cannot get an appointment with their GP flooding A&E departments and would save the NHS more than £300million. ‘This will be better for patients, because they have better access to their GP surgery; better for the NHS, because it will save money currently spent in A&E; and better for Britain, because it is the kind of health service we need’, he said. The Conservatives called it an ‘unfunded pie in the sky policy’ and said they had scrapped the 48 hour target because doctors found it counter-productive to patient care. Mr Miliband told an audience in Manchester that Labour would allow patients to speak to a doctor or triage nurse, rather than a receptionist on the phone straightaway. If their condition is judged to need immediate attention they can see a GP the same day. All patients would have the right to see a GP at their own practice within 48 hours if they want to, although not necessarily the GP of their choice. The number of patients who see a doctor within 48 hours has dropped from 80 per cent to 40 per cent under the Coalition, Mr Miliband . Chaand Nagpaul at the British Medical Association said last year when this policy was suggested that ‘arbitrary targets, even for limited periods, are unlikely to alleviate the pressures on the NHS and could make the situation worse. He added: ‘It is likely to result in a rush for appointments when practices open which could overwhelm GP services and restrict the freedom of GPs to schedule appointments beyond 48 hours for patients with long-term conditions.’ Labour sources claimed the 48 hour guarantee would not be the same as the previous target, as patients who want to wait more than two days to see their own GP will still be able to. GPs can spend the extra funding as they see fit, by hiring more staff or asking GPs to work longer hours. The cost would be funded by cutting £78million of administration and legal fees associated with EU competition law, and reining in the £3million a month spending on consultants by three health quangos – Monitor, the Trust Development Authority and Commissioning Support Units. Mr Miliband also told an audience of health workers that he would repeal the Health and Social Care Act– the law putting GPs back in charge of health budgets. A Conservative Party spokesman said: 'Once again Labour's sums simply don't add up. Ed Miliband promised 'iron discipline' on spending, but he's too weak to stick to it. He's got no economic plan to secure Britain's future. 'All he does offer are more of the same old failed Labour policies from the past - more spending, more borrowing and more taxes.'","Royal College of GPs says £3billion is needed to fulfil the ambitious pledge .

"By . Mark Duell . The owner of an animal centre set up in memory of her murdered grandparents has avoided jail despite being found guilty of cruelty to the pets she rescued. Dying or dead animals were found around the sanctuary run by 27-year-old Lindsay Newell in Etwall, Derbyshire, while others were sick or malnourished and emaciated. The veterinary nurse devoted all her spare time and money to the centre, but ‘took her eye off the ball’ and the animals suffered as a result, Stafford Magistrates’ Court heard. Scroll down for video . Conditional discharge: Lindsay Newell is approached by an RSPCA officer at her house in Staffordshire . Guilty of cruelty: One of Newell's animals, a pig named 'Babe' (pictured), who made headlines two years ago after being saved from a squalid council house, died as RSPCA officers raided the centre following a tip-off . One of them, a pig named ‘Babe’, who was featured in MailOnline in March 2012 after being saved from a squalid council house, died as RSPCA officers raided the centre following a tip-off. A trial was told Newell’s claims that she ‘didn’t notice anything wrong’ were simply ‘incredible’. Yesterday . at Burton-upon-Trent Magistrates’ Court, she was banned from keeping . animals after being found guilty of six counts of cruelty and handed a . two-year conditional discharge. But . she was cleared of a further 25 charges that she failed to feed the . animals properly after the judge decided she had done her best to feed . the animals in her care. Today . the RSPCA, which itself took sick and injured animals to the centre, . was left counting the £20,000 cost of a prosecution against a woman a . judge admitted had only ‘a desire to help.’ The . organisation charged Newell after swooping on the Burton Wildlife and . Animal Rescue Centre in Etwall, along with police and trading standards . officials. Hearing: Newell (right) leaves Burton-upon-Trent Magistrates' Court following her sentencing yesterday . They also raided Newell’s home in . nearby Stapenhill as part of a county-wide operation called Operation . Mako, set up to tackle rural crime. She had opened the centre in her own back . garden in March 2008 in memory of her grandparents, who were killed by . their nephew Richard Barlow, 29. 'Her evidence that she didn’t notice anything wrong is incredible. The responsible owner would have noticed' Dingleby Clark, prosecuting . He battered Bill Barlow, 78, and his 65 year-old wife to death in 2007 during a violent row over land. Their . granddaughter Newell said their love of animals and the countryside . inspired her. She wept as she told the judge how she cared for her . animals. She told the court . her salary went towards running the sanctuary - which cost £2,000 in . rent a year - and up to £400 a week on straw and animal food. But . the prosecution painted a very different picture, accusing her of . causing unnecessary suffering by not giving the animals enough food and . failing to seek veterinary help for them. Police and RSPCA officers raided the centre in November 2012 after members of the public raised concerns. 'Seriously undernourished': Babe was filmed at the centre in Derbyshire in a shocking state. It was the second time the pig had been found in squalor, having been rescued from that situation in Derby in March 2012 . Muddy water: The Gloucestershire old spot pig had been rescued from a council house in Derby in 2012. Video footage of the dying animal's final moments was among the evidence shown during the five-day trial . Among the animals was ‘Babe’ the pig, who was lying in muddy water in a paddock ‘seriously undernourished’. The Gloucestershire old spot pig had been rescued from a council house in Derby in March 2012. Video footage of the dying animal’s final moments was among the evidence shown at Stafford Magistrates’ Court during the five-day trial. 'These were not deliberate or intentional acts. They were a consequence of you trying to do too much' District Judge David Taylor . Dingleby Clark, prosecuting, said the pig was one of a large number of animals found to be suffering. He said: ‘This pig was being looked after by the defendant, but for some reason she did not give the required care to this pig and it died.’ Newell was accused of causing suffering to turkeys, cockerels, sheep, a Canada goose, horses, ponies and piglets. Mr Clark added: ‘She had too many animals and too few staff. She had too many different species.’ Animal centre: A trial was told Newell's claims that she 'didn't notice anything wrong' were simply 'incredible' He said that at some point in 2012, Newell started a new job and moved away after which she ‘had completely taken her eye off the ball’. 'Too few staff': Newell was accused of causing suffering to turkeys, cockerels, sheep, a Canada goose, horses, ponies and piglets . The centre was ‘out of control’, with animals suffering and dying, he said. Inspectors also found the carcass of a lamb, which had starved to death, in a field. Sarah Levy volunteered at the centre for six months until around June 2012. When she left she wrote a letter to the RSPCA expressing her concerns about the standard of care for the animals. RSPCA deputy chief inspector Jayne Bashford said there was very little grazing area for the animals and distinctly remembered no water being available. She ran her hands over animals and could feel their spines and ribs. Newell refused to comment in police interviews. She replied with ‘no comment’ to all questions during a 44-minute interview in December 2012. She told the court had been ‘intimidated’ and ‘shocked’ when the centre was raided. Giving evidence Newell said she would take animals home with her from a vet’s practice where she used to work so they were not put down. She took in wildlife and poultry that other centres turned away. She moved the sanctuary to Etwall in 2011 and said the RSPCA was among those that would take animals to the centre. ‘Rescuing is the main part of what we do, so if an animal is trapped down a drain or an animal has been shot, or on ice, or a fox is trapped in a fences we would rescue them,’ she said. ‘It’s things that normal members of the public can’t deal with.’ She told the court in June 2012 she started working on a farm at a school in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, for autistic children. But Mr Clark said Newell should have checked the animals more often. He said: ‘Her evidence that she didn’t notice anything wrong is incredible. The responsible owner would have noticed.’ Died: Babe was discovered living in a small end-terrace home by officials when they tried to evict her owner . Pigsty: Babe was discovered when council housing staff forced their way into a home in Sinfin, Derby . Newell has now been made redundant from her job, but still runs the centre, where she had 300 animals. Nigel Weller, defending, said his client now wanted to dedicate her life to running the sanctuary. 'She had too many animals and too few staff. She had too many different species' Dingleby Clark, prosecuting . The RSPCA said it cost £20,000 to investigate the case and bring Newell to court, of which she will have to pay just £2,000. District Judge David Taylor found her guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to a pig, a pony, a goat and sheep. He gave Newell a two-year conditional discharge and disqualified her from keeping sheep, goats, pigs and equine animals for five years. Passing sentence, he said: ‘These were not deliberate or intentional acts. They were a consequence of you trying to do too much. Your attempts to help the animals caused you to get into this mess.’","Dying or dead animals were found around sanctuary run by Lindsay Newell .

"Alex Salmond might be struggling to win the argument over Scottish independence but today insisted he is winning the battle of the bulge. The Scottish First Minister revealed he has been on the 5:2 diet for months, and has lost 2st 4lbs, with another stone to go to reach his target weight. Accusing George Osborne of coming to the diet craze late, Mr Salmond said he had been advised to try the 5:2 by Mervyn King when he was the governor of the Bank of England. Alex Salmond, pictured left in April, says he has lost 2st 4lbs since embarking on the 5:2 diet to shed the pounds seen in September 2012 (right) Mr Salmond said that after easily shedding the pounds, he is now struggling to reach his target weight. 'I have lost 2st 4lbs. The last stone is proving a bit trickier than the previous 2st 4lb,' he told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme. Mr Osborne has used the 5:2 diet to get in shape, which means he has to fast for two days a week. It appears to be paying off, with the Tory Chancellor looking noticeably trimmer in recent weeks. But Mr Salmond claimed the Chancellor had come to the diet late. 'He started substantially after I did. On the issue of 5:2, as one the issue of sterling, George Osborne will see the error of his ways.' Bizarrely, Mr Salmond decided to go on the diet after taking advice from the country's top banker. 'Mervyn King told me to go on it,' he said. 'I can reveal my dietary adviser is the former governor of the Bank of England.' Former Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King suggested Mr Salmond try to the diet craze . Mr Osborne imposed austerity measures . on his food intake as part of an image makeover, which aides hope will . boost his chances of succeeding David Cameron. The Chancellor has already abandoned his . foppish former haircut in favour of a close cropped Caesar cut, which . his allies believe looks more serious. The diet requires Mr Osborne to limit his intake to 600 calories two days a week and eat normally on the other five.","Scottish First Minister says he is winning the battle of the bulge .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Ed Miliband today boasted he is 'more competent' than David Cameron, as a damning poll showed Labour is more unpopular than any opposition party for three decades. The Tories have secured a two-point lead in to separate opinion polls, with just a year to go until the general election. Labour is on just 31 per cent in the latest ICM survey, lower than even Neil Kinnock, William Hague and Michael Howard who all led their parties to defeat on polling day. The latest ICM poll puts Labour on just 31 per cent, the lowest level of support for an opposition party a year out from a general election . The polls will make grim reading for Ed Miliband, after he launched a new policy to guarantee patients would see a GP within 48 hours . The economic recovery has seen an improvement in the Tories' fortunes in the polls. The new ICM poll for The Guardian puts the Conservatives on 33 per cent with Labour on 31 per cent, the lowest since the immediate aftermath of the disastrous 2010 election. A year before the 2010 election the Tories were ahead on 39 per cent, with Gordon Brown's Labour on 28 per cent. In 1996, 12 months before Tony Blair's first electoral landslide, Labour was on 45 per cent with John Major's Tories on just 28 per cent. Labour under Mr Kinnock was also ahead in 1986 and 1991, before being beaten by the Tories a year later. The polls are certain to trigger fears in Labour ranks that the party is failing to 'seal the deal' with voters with a year until Mr Miliband tries to take power. Polls at the weekend showed two-thirds of people backed Labour's policies on energy bills, railways and rent controls, but only 23 per cent think Mr Miliband is up to the job of being Prime Minister. It is the first time the Tories have been ahead in the polls since before the disastrous 'omnishambles' budget in 2012 . The rise in the Tory fortunes has come as the economic recovery gains pace, raising fears in the Labour party that their attacks on the cost of living could be eroded if voters start to feel better off . Former Labour trade minister  Lord Diby Jones today slammed the party for being anti-business. Several senior Labour figures are worried about the party's reputation in the business community, after a series of attacks on banks, energy firms and house builders. Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics Lord Digby Jones, former Trade Minister, said: 'The Labour leadership is one of the least business friendly leaders of political parties I’ve seen for years.' Tory MP Brooks Newmark said: ‘Even Digby Jones, who served alongside Ed Miliband under Gordon Brown, realises that Labour’s short term gimmicks would stop businesses creating jobs and risk the recovery. ‘Ed Miliband has no plan and his only policies are the same old Labour solutions of more spending, more borrowing and more taxes.' To counter the criticism, Mr Miliband today insisted he was better than Mr Cameron. The Labour leader played down the significance of a set of polls which showed Conservatives establishing a lead over his party for the first time since George Osborne's 'omnishambles' budget more than two years ago. Two surveys - an ICM poll for The Guardian and another carried out for Tory peer Lord Ashcroft - gave Mr Cameron's party a two-point lead, a year ahead of the 2015 general election. Just days ahead of elections to English councils and the European Parliament on May 22, Mr Miliband insisted he was right to focus on the 'cost-of-living crisis' facing British families. Despite positive economic figures over recent months, ordinary people were 'deeply discontented' with the way in which the country is being run, and feel that the benefits from growth have been skewed towards those at the top of society, he said. Challenged over whether voters saw him as a potential prime minister, Mr Miliband told BBC1's Breakfast: 'My approach has been to talk consistently about the big questions our country faces and the biggest question of all that every country is wrestling with - are we going to be run for a few people at the top, with growing gaps between the richest and everybody else, or are ordinary people going to get a fair shot? 'I am going to keep talking consistently about that, because I think that is the biggest question our country faces.' Asked if this approach would make him a better PM than Mr Cameron, the Labour leader said: 'It makes me more personally competent because I get what people are feeling and we can do something about it. 'The most important thing as a Prime Minister is to understand what people think and what you can do about it and to show the difference you can make to their lives, and that's what I will do, and solidity of belief and purpose.' David Cameron and Boris Johnson celebrate winning a table football game yesterday, as the first poll emerged putting the Tories ahead . The ICM poll for the Guardian, released as US president Barack Obama's former campaign guru David Axelrod arrived in London to begin work with Mr Miliband's party, put the Conservatives on 33 per cent, with Labour sliding six points since April to 31 per cent, Ukip on 15 per cent - a four point gain since last month - and the Liberal Democrats up one point to 13 per cent. Mr Miliband was given a net approval rating of minus 25, with 51 per cent of voters believing he is doing a bad job and just 26 per cent believing he is doing well. Mr Cameron enjoyed a dramatic improvement from the minus 15 rating he received 12 months ago, to plus two now, with 44 per cent of voters believing he is doing a good job, against 42 per cent who think he is doing badly. The first in a series of weekly telephone surveys carried out for Lord Ashcroft put David Cameron's party on 34 per cent, two points ahead of Labour on 32 per cent, with the UK Independence Party third on 15 per cent and Liberal Democrats trailing on 9 per cent. But Mr Miliband said: 'Polls go up and down. I've seen that over three and a half years in this job. I think what matters is talking about the bread and butter issues people face - energy prices, childcare, the NHS, how we can improve GP access, something Labour is leading the other parties on. 'We will talk about the issues that matter to people. We will focus on these questions. The people will make the decisions a week on Thursday and at the general election.' Mr Miliband said he was 'very disappointed' at the Government's response to his high-profile announcement yesterday of a Labour promise to give all NHS patients access to a GP within 48 hours. 'They say doctors can't deliver it,' he said. 'They are writing off the idea that we can deliver appointments in 48 hours and so we are going to have to wait more than a week. That's not good enough. I'm determined we can make a difference.'","Labour is on 31% in the latest ICM survey, two points behind the Tories .

"By . Sally Lee . Smokey just might be living proof of that common myth: cats have nine lives. But whether or not it's true - he's one damn lucky kitten. So now the six-week-old is safe and sound, with possibly eight more lives to go, after being rescued by paramedics and firefighters at a burning house in Nowra. He's alive! Bomaderry paramedic Kim Saunders cuddled Smokey the kitten following resuscitation with a baby oxygen mask . Emergency services crew worked hard to bring little Smokey back to life when his unconscious body was first discovered under a bed by a firefighter on Friday at after 11pm. The grey fur-ball, who was covered in soot, had suffered from smoke inhalation and required CPR, which was promptly performed by the firefighter. Little Smokey was then taken in by Bombaderry paramedic Kim Sauders who revived the cat inside the ambulance at the scene with a baby's oxygen mask. 'When we first saw Smokey he was covered in black sludge,' she told the Daily Telegraph. 'After 10-15minutes he started meowing again. I pulled off the mask and he pulled it straight back on, it was like he knew — he was enjoying it,' she said. Smokey's owner Marianne Hense wasn't at home at the time but was relieved that her kitten was saved. 'Everything's going to be ok': Within 15 minutes in the ambulance the kitten was purring . 'I don't care about anything inside the house, only that my cats were safe,' she said. Fire crews arrived at the fibro house, on Kalandar Street, and found no other occupants were inside except for Smokey. Ms Saunders, who's been a paramedic for 15 years, said it wasn't the first time she had rescued a pet. It was only two weeks ago that she rescued a Labrador puppy which had been cornered by foxes. In January, she also saved another dog who was running dangerously along the Princes Highway at South Nowra. 'My sister is a former veterinary nurse — she says I missed my calling,' Ms Saunders said.","Unconscious six-week-old kitten found under a bed by a firefighter at burning house .

"By . John Hall . A mourner attacked six guests at a wake after attending a friend’s funeral, a court has heard. Jacqueline Coltman, 42, left the dead woman’s sister with a broken shoulder and punched a child to the ground during a fight outside the Windsor Castle pub in Heavitree, Exeter, it was claimed. The drunken brawl took place in December 2012 during a large party following the funeral of Selina Nicholas - a 49-year-old mother-of-seven who died after becoming addicted to a powerful legal high fifty times stronger than cannabis. Scene of the alleged attack: Exeter Crown Court was told Jacqueline Coltman punched a child to the ground and started attacking other guests during a fight outside the Windsor Castle pub in Heavitree (pictured) Two children and the sister of the dead woman were among the alleged victims of the assault, Exeter Crown Court was told. Coltman, of Minchinghampton in . Gloucestershire, denies causing grievous bodily harm to one guest, . actual bodily harm to another and battery against three more. The jury have been told she has already received a police caution for a sixth assault by battery after admitting pulling another mourner’s hair. Mr David Bowen, prosecuting, said the wake followed the funeral of Selina Nicholas and the most seriously injured victim was the dead woman's sister, Chiquita Owen. 'The defendant went to the funeral wake at which she was drunk and there was pent-up feeling between her and some of the people at the gathering,' he said. 'As a result of that she attacked six of them. There were children there but it is fair to say that there was a great deal of drinking taking place among the adults and some of the witnesses and victims were drunk,' he added. Wake: The drunken brawl occurred after the funeral of Selina Nicholas (pictured left and right). At an inquest into her death, the coroner was told the mother-of-seven died after getting addicted to a powerful legal high . 'The defendant became more and more unpleasant to a child who was at the wake and to the child’s mother. The child stood up for herself and was punched in the chest fell on the ground where she momentarily lost consciousness,' Mr Bowen went on to say. The court was told that Chiquita Owen went outside the pub and saw the child on the floor. She asked the defendant what was happening and in response Coltman struck her hard to the face, breaking her glasses, it was alleged. 'She grabbed her hair and she fell to the ground where she landed on top of her as a result of which she suffered a fractured collar bone and other injuries,' Mr Bowen said. He added that Coltman went on to punch other mourners or grab them by the hair before going back into the pub where she hit another mourner. The incident occurred at the funeral of Selina Nicholas, which took place one month after her death in November 2012. Legal highs: Selina Nicholas, pictured, was found dead by one of her sons in 2012. Coroner Elizabeth Earland recorded an open verdict but said she could not establish for certain that legal highs had caused Selina's death . Coltman was arrested following the drunken brawl during her friend's wake. She said she had only pulled one woman’s hair and not carried out any of the other alleged assaults. The trial continues.

"By . Lucy Crossley . Thug: Rex Gardner has been jailed for eight years after he bit off a policeman's ear in a drunken attack . A thug who bit off a policeman’s ear in a drunken attack leaving the officer with life changing injuries has been jailed for eight years. Police had been called to Rex Gardner's home after a 999 call was made by the 43-year-old's ex-partner following a domestic disturbance. But when constables Steve Fisher and Daniel Gildersleve arrived at the house in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, Gardner turned on them - hurling PC Fisher into a kitchen table before biting through the top part of his right ear. PCs Fisher and Gildersleve had arrived at the property at around 11.30pm on August 15 last year, and as they spoke to Gardner to assess what had happened between the couple he became increasingly aggressive. He had been drinking excessively before police arrived and suddenly become violent, lunging towards PC Fisher, grabbed him around his body armour, knocking over the kitchen table as he did so. When PC Gildersleve tried to intervene Gardner, 43, hurled a glass vase at him. As he officers tried to regain control of Gardner and protect his girlfriend, PC Fisher was pulled to the floor. Gardner then leant in towards PC Fisher and tore off the top part of his right ear with his teeth. A court heard the officer needed surgery after the attack and was left with a life-long scar. Gardner had pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of . causing grievous bodily harm, but was convicted of the more serious . offence of causing grievous bodily harm with intent after a three . day trial and was jailed on Monday at St Albans Crown Court. 'This attack was outrageously violent and totally unprovoked,' said Detective inspector Jon Dick following the sentencing. 'PC Fisher and Gilderselve had attended the address to provide support to a vulnerable victim of domestic abuse and the traumatic events of that night I’m sure will live with them for a very long time. 'Gardner is a violent man and the sentence he has been given reflects the severity of his appalling crimes.' Injury: Gardner then leant in towards PC Fisher and tore off the top part of his right ear with his teeth, leaving the officer needing surgery for his life-changing injuries . Chief constable Andy Bliss added: 'Everyday officers put themselves at risk to protect the public and this incident is just one example of the dangers faced by frontline staff. 'PC Fisher and Gildersleve acted with bravery in what was an appalling situation. 'The officers had no indication until the last possible moment that they were dealing with such a dangerous offender.

"By . Julian Robinson . They are the fearless Russian freedivers who enjoy nothing more than a dip in freezing Arctic seas with little more than a wetsuit and gloves to keep out the cold. Hardened swimmers gather ever year for a bone-chilling plunge at the Arctic Circle Dive Centre by the White Sea in Karelia, Northern Russia. Despite temperatures in the water dipping as low as minus two, the people who take part insist they actually enjoy the experience. Weightless looking divers seem to glide effortlessly through the green, staring at the camera in front, as if ready to embrace it . A diver takes deep breaths with arms stretched out preparing to plunge in to the icy waters of Arctic Russia. This swimmer is one of many Russian free divers who gather each year at the Arctic Circle Dive Centre by the White Sea in Karelia, Northern Russia .

Banfi, 56, from Cadro, Switzerland, who had flown with friends to . Kuusamo in Finland, before driving to the centre. Using a spidery looking underwater camera, he captured the scenes as groups of divers took it in turns to brave the icy depths. Wearing just seven millimetre thick wetsuits, the divers enter waters of minus two degrees for 15 to 20 minutes - before they are forced to leave and warm themselves up. The sea water can reach sub zero temperatures due to its salt-content while the ice that covers it contains very little salt.

"By . John Hall . People from the north of England consider London to be chaotic, crowded and bad for Britain, according to a study released today. Only 24 per cent of those living outside the capital think London has a positive impact on their local economy, with that figure even lower in northern cities such as Liverpool and Sheffield, where the number drops to just nine per cent and eight per cent respectively. While two thirds of the population agree London has a positive impact on the national economy, the same number argue that the capital unfairly benefits from central government being based there. Divide: While two thirds of the population agree London benefits the national economy (green figures), only 24 per cent of those living outside the capital think it has a positive impact at a local level (red figures) The figures come from a report for Centre for Cities and the Centre for London, with YouGov questioning residents in 16 towns and cities across the UK. The study confirms the suspicion of a growing divide between London and the rest of the country - something that has long been suggested by the capital's property bubble. The results point to something a ripple effect in opinion, with the towns and cities closest to London feeling most positive about the capital's impact, and those further away feeling the least positive. This is magnified in parts of Yorkshire, with just eight per cent of those living in Hull and Sheffield thinking London has a positive impact on their city. The results are not must better in Leeds where the number is 13 per cent. Unfair: Only 24 per cent of non-Londoners think the capital (pictured) has a positive impact on their local economy. Meanwhile two thirds argue London unfairly benefits from central government being based there . Ignored: Only 17 per cent of non-Londoners think Westminster politicians such as Chancellor George Osborne (left) and Prime Minister David Cameron (right) are responsive to local issues . It's not just the capital's economic impact that has been called into question. Three quarters of those asked also felt the media focuses too much on London at the expense of other British cities. Meanwhile 64 per cent of non-Londoners claimed the government paid too much attention to issues in the capital, with only 17 per cent thinking Westminster politicians were responsive to local issues. The only city to buck this trend was Manchester, where a slightly more positive 21 per cent either strongly agreed to tended to agree with the claim that Whitehall was in touch with local issues. But despite feeling unhappy Londoners get a much better deal than those living in other parts of the country, only one in five said they would consider moving to the capital to improve their opportunities. This, it was suggested, is down to a widespread belief that London is not a happy or comfortable place to live. Responding to questions on their opinions of quality of life in the capital, 62 per cent on non-Londoners described it as 'expensive', 59 per cent as 'crowded' and 30 per cent as 'chaotic'. Only 32 per cent thought London was a good place to raise a family.","Only a quarter outside London agree capital is good for their local economy .

Mrs Bathew has . even become an Instagram sensation after setting up an account dedicated . to photos of her new features. She said: 'I’d always hated my small boobs, but after I had my two children, they were saggy too - they looked like a Cocker Spaniel’s ears. Mrs Bathew said her breasts (pictured) - which she says were 'saggy and lifeless' - used to make her 'depressed' Mrs Bathew pictured moments before her op - which she had just three months before her wedding . 'I did everything I could to hide them, and there is no way I was going to walk down the aisle with everyone looking at me in a dress like that. 'Some people have said I’m vain, but I don’t mind admitting that - I want to look my best for my husband. 'They did make me feel insecure, but it wasn’t simply vanity that made me have surgery - I wanted to be a stunning bride. 'Ryan knew how much I wanted bigger boobs, and I knew he’d buy them for me - he just wanted me to be happy on my wedding day.'

'We had a mini-moon afterwards where we spent a few days at a spa - any excuse to get a bikini on. 'Having your boobs done takes courage, fair play to anyone who changes something they don’t like. 'I view surgery like most girls view fake eye lashes, it really isn’t a big deal. 'Since having my boob job I have set up an Instagram page for my new twin girls, I have named them Heidi and Audrini from The Hills.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . David Hammond, 27, claimed his fiancee's £20,000 ring was stolen during a holiday to Brazil . A businessman was caught out making a bogus insurance claim for his fiancée’s £20,000 diamond ring after she was spotted wearing it on Facebook. David Hammond, 27, said the jewellery had been stolen during a holiday in Brazil. He reported the theft to police in Rio de Janeiro and then filed an insurance claim on his return to Britain in January last year. But when the insurance underwriters spotted the telltale photo on his fiancee’s Facebook page, he claimed he had found the ring. He finally withdrew the insurance claim seven months later, the Old Bailey was told. Hammond, a partner in a furniture company, pleaded guilty to one charge of fraud against Aqueduct underwriters. Yesterday Judge Charles Wide QC gave him a six-month prison sentence suspended for 12 months. The judge ordered Hammond to carry out 200 hours unpaid work, spend three months on an electronically tagged curfew at his home between 8pm and 7am and pay £300 costs. Judge Wide told him: ‘This was thoroughly dishonest. You quite deliberately made a bogus insurance claim trying to con an insurance company out of £20,000. ‘False claims add to other people’s premiums so this is not a victimless crime. ‘Having been caught out because your fiancée was seen displaying the ring on Facebook, the insurance company asked loss adjusters to look at it and some three or four months after this bogus claim you told a pack of lies about it and you didn’t withdraw the claim until August. The businessman made an insurance claim back in the UK - but was caught out when his bride-to-be posted this image of the £20,000 ring on her Facebook page . 'You didn’t even tell the whole truth to the police.’ Hammond, of Palmers Green, north London, is a partner in Focus Furnishing in north-west London. He is due to marry his fiancée in September. Detective Constable Patrick Einsmann, who led City of London Police’s investigation, said: ‘Hammond thought his fraudulent claim would see him quids in but it has instead left him heading down the aisle with a criminal record and a suspended jail term to his name.’","David Hammond, 27, said the £20,000 ring was stolen during Brazil holiday .

Jackie Keily, curator at the Museum of London, said: ‘We believe from its distinctive white clay that it was made in Cheam between 1350 and 1440.’ Also found have been 16th Century tobacco pipes, arrow heads and 1,000 year old timbers. While excavating the original brick arches under the famous station, hundreds of historic artefacts have been found, including timber piles that date back to AD59-83 and may have formed part of a waterfront building near London Bridge. While excavating the original brick arches under the famous station, hundreds of historic artefacts, such as this arrowhead have been found . It was also revealed that archaeologists found fragments of medieval floors and walls that could have been part of large houses along Tooley Street owned by important clerics . Researchers also uncovered traces of the Romans, including a previously unknown bathhouse under Borough High Street. And they also found evidence that there may have been Saxon or medieval military defences near the river. Nicky Hughes, the head of communications for Network Rail, London and South East, said: ‘As one of London's oldest stations it's not surprising that we are unearthing such a range of interesting finds shedding light on London's development through the ages.

"By . Laura Williamson . Follow @@laura_mail . Helena Costa, a Portuguese coach nicknamed ‘Mourinho in a petticoat’, has made history by being appointed as the first woman to manage in the top two divisions of a major European league. The 36-year-old, formerly head coach of Iran’s national women’s team, will take charge of French second tier side Clermont Foot at the end of the season, replacing Regis Brouard. Historic: Portugal's Helena Costa has been appointed manager of French Ligue 2 side Clermont Foot . Costa met Jose Mourinho at Benfica, where she coached boys teams from Under 9 to Under 17. She then served an internship with Chelsea’s Academy and women’s sides in 2005 during Mourinho’s first spell at the club. Her intense will to win drew comparisons with the Chelsea boss, prompting Costa to be tagged ‘Mourinho in a petticoat’. She has since gone on to work as a scout for Celtic and gain respect as a coach in her own right in both the men’s and women’s games. As . recently as 2010, Costa said she did not expect to see a female managing . a professional men’s team for at least another 60 years. ‘Working . in professional football is a dream for me,’ she added. ‘It will not . happen quickly - maybe for my great-grandchildren. But I did not go to . the end of the world to train to give up.’ Clermont . defender Jacques Salze said club president Claude Michy had already . called several key players telling them to trust and respect his . decision. But Salze claimed there would be ‘no revolution’ since the club already has a female physiotherapist, Severine Chapeyron. ‘The . physio sees us in our underwear all day!’ he said. ‘This appointment . does not change much. After we take our shower I do not think she . (Costa) will be there. Comparisons: A former Benfica youth coach, Costa was been dubbed 'Mourinho in a petticoat' ‘Our . coach has absolute authority. It’s like with your boss, you have to . respect him or her. It will be weird to some, but I do not mind. There . will be no revolution. ‘She is a woman, but she is a coach, and will remain a coach.’ The Clermont players were told on Wednesday morning before training. Striker Remy Dugimont told L’Equipe: ‘It is a surprise, a big surprise. It came out of nowhere but it is good: it will create a buzz and will be a unique experience. ‘I’m not macho. She has worked in the profession and all the boys know how it works. At first it will be a little weird but it will only last a few days.’ Defender Anthony Lippini added: ‘I spoke with the physio about the first time a woman entered the army. It was a very macho environment. ‘Now there are many women in the army and it may be the same in football. I cannot wait for next season to discover. I’m really curious. Proven record: Costa has been head coach of the Iran and Qatar women's national teams . ‘It will be a unique experience to be the first professional football team in France to be managed by a woman.’ Costa, a UEFA ‘A’ licensed coach, took Portuguese side Cheleirense to the Lisbon Regional Championship in 2006. She remembers having to ‘change the whole mentality in a town where women still had a very submissive role’. She was eventually dismissed for ‘lack of results’ with the team topping the district championship table. Veronique Soulier, president of Clermont Foot’s supporters’ club, said: ‘It surprised us, but we all believe that it is a good thing. ‘The boys in the team can be difficult to manage. They can be quite sensitive, that is what the other coaches have told us. With a woman in charge, maybe they will be less demanding.’","Costa has been appointed manager of French Ligue 2 side Clermont Foot .

"By . Neil Ashton . Follow @@neilashton_ . Roy Hodgson claimed England could win the World Cup on Monday as he prepares to unleash his young Lions in Brazil. The England manager was in bullish mood after naming a refreshing 23-man squad. Eight outfield players are under the age of 24. As revealed in Sportsmail on Monday, Phil Jones, Luke Shaw, Ross Barkley, Jordan Henderson, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Raheem Sterling, Jack Wilshere and Danny Welbeck all made the cut. Sportsmail has been campaigning for the manager to put his faith in the country’s young talent, and on Monday Hodgson said: ‘I believe this squad can win the World Cup, otherwise what’s the point? If we’re going to win it, we’ll have to play very well, and this talented group have to show their talent. THe boss: Roy Hodgson has named his 23 man squad for the World Cup in Brazil . Star man: Wayne Rooney is one of the key strikers in Roy Hodgson's 23-man squad . ‘We’re right to have some degree of optimism. We’ll feed off that and do everything to make sure we don’t let our country down. ‘I am excited about the squad, I am excited that there are young players in there who have a future. Their future has to be immediately. I have selected them because I believe they could go into the team and play well, just as I see them play well in the Premier League every weekend. ‘There will be pressure on them and there is no way of relieving that pressure. I feel a sense of positivity around the general public because they are hoping we will play well and do well. ‘As the England manager taking a team to the World Cup, you have to accept there is going to be pressure on you and everyone wants you to do well. ‘I don’t really see a point in trying to fool people and play it down.’ Among those overlooked by Hodgson was striker Jermain Defoe, who was expecting to go to Brazil having been a squad regular for the past two years. ‘It’s hard even to find words to describe how I am feeling,’ said Defoe, 31, who left Tottenham earlier this year for a lucrative contract at MLS side Toronto FC. Young Lions: Raheem Sterling is one of several young players included in England's charge for Brazil . Impressed: Adam Lallana capped off a brilliant season by being named in England's squad for Brazil . ‘I felt I had done enough. I feel sharper than ever and I have been on form and scored goals. ‘To miss out, I feel devastated. I didn’t really feel I had to sell myself to the manager. I had a situation at the 2012 Euros where I lost my dad and I had a decision to make. But I chose to go back out to Poland and Ukraine because I know how important it is to play for your country.’ In keeping with the squad’s youthful flavour, Hodgson named Liverpool defender Jon Flanagan, 21, and Everton centre half John Stones, 19, on his seven-strong standby list amid concerns over the fitness of Jones. The Manchester United defender has a bruised shoulder, but Hodgson hopes he will make a full recovery by the time he nominates his final 23 on June 2. Flanagan and Stones will travel to Portugal with England as the team’s medics continue to monitor Jones. Devastated: Toronto FC striker Jermain Defoe thought he had done enough to be selected . Back in action: Jack Wilshere has been named despite a lengthy spell out with injury . The other standby players — John Ruddy, Michael Carrick, Andy Carroll, Defoe and Tom Cleverley — are free to go on holiday. Hodgson admitted he would be prepared to make an SOS call to Ashley Cole if Leighton Baines picked up an injury before England’s opening game against Italy on June 14. Cole announced his international retirement on Sunday after rejecting the chance to be on Hodgson’s standby list and has no intention of playing for England again. But it is possible to bring in a replacement between June 2-13 if a player picks up an injury that rules him out of the tournament. Rio Ferdinand was injured in the build-up to South Africa 2010 and replaced by Michael Dawson. Hodgson said: ‘Ashley Cole isn’t really a cover player. Ashley is a No 1 man. ‘When I decided Leighton Baines might be No 1, then I decided the next one would be Luke Shaw.‘Circumstances could make the decision a very good one or it could make it a very bad one.’ Young gun: Saints starlet Luke Shaw has been picked ahead of Ashley Cole . World at his feet: Everton starlet Ross Barkley could be one of England's wild cards in Brazil .","Roy Hodgson puts faith in young players like Ross Barkley, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Raheem Sterling and Luke Shaw .

This wasn’t a problem for innovative documentarian Alex Chacón, 26, who managed to condense 600 days of travel into under three minutes worth of video. From Alaska to Argentina, the professional traveller's trusty camera managed to capture all the places he visited - 36 countries in total. Not your average travel snaps: Avid motorcyclist and professional traveller Alex Chacón has found an interesting way to keep people interested in his travels . Taking his show on the road: Alex is pictured visiting the Taj Mahal in India, just one of the 36 countries he visited . The avid motorcyclist, born in Texas but raised between the US and Mexico, travelled around the world on his bike, managing to visit 36 countries in 600 days. Wanting a unique way to showcase the people he met and places he visited, Alex attached a GoPro camera to a selfie tripod. In the process, he managed to capture himself motorcycling, mountain climbing, mud bathing and much more. While he told his fellow travellers, or co-stars, that he was documenting the trip - he was not able to tell when it would be released. Almost like tug-of-war: Alex can be seen holding the selfie tripod in most of the vignettes that were merged and became his three year epic selfie . For some, they’ve been ‘very excited to find themselves’, Alex told MailOnline. For others, it was 'kind of a surprise when they showed up' – especially given the short film’s growing popularity. When asked where his favourite location visited was, he wasn’t able to decide. 'That's like having seven children and deciding which one you love the most' But that doesn’t mean he’s not keeping a list of his favourite places – he just can’t narrow it down to one. Oh, the Places You'll Go: Alex was keen to showcase the people he met on his trip, just as much as the locations he visited . From Alaska to Argentina: Alex's trusty GoPro camera managed to capture his selfies . Write caption here . Alex's three favourite destinations so far have been Alaska, Bolivia and Brazil. After spending fourteen days camping in Alaska, trying to catch the famed Northern Lights, he finally did - on his birthday. 'It inspired and fulfilled me with positive energy to continue travelling,' he says . Another experience he cherishes is visiting the largest waterfall in Brazil. 'The force of power,' helped him to see 'the world and the actual wonders in a very nice way.' Making friends: Alex advised all of the people filmed with him in the video that he was working on the project and some got quite the surprise when they saw themselves in the finished product . I'm on a boat! No, that is not a fishing rod - Alex took his selfie tripod with him on every leg of his journey . Mountain climbing and mudbathing: The epic video managed to condense 600 days of travel into under three minutes . The final of his inspiring destinations was the Uyuni Salt Flat in Bolivia. 'It completely altered my being in a positive way - it was a very nice spiritual journey.' With the travel bug not yet out of his system, Alex has trips planned to Africa and possibly Australia.","Intrepid motorcyclist merges vignettes into round the world selfie .

"By . Sarah Bridge . British people are keen wine-drinkers, getting through an impressive 1.6 billion bottles of wine every year. However it appears that while we are happy slurping, swilling and sipping, we are far from experts on what we're actually drinking. In fact, more than two-thirds of us admit to bluffing when it comes to choosing wine. The supermarket shelves are packed with wine - but do we have any idea what we're buying? A survey commissioned by the Wine and Spirit Education Trust revealed that 70 per cent of British drinkers are selecting a bottle of white or red without really knowing what they're doing. Its researches found three-quarters of women drinkers and two-thirds of male drinkers were 'not confident' in their knowledge of wine. Possibly unsurprisingly, men also admitted to being more likely to bluff than women, pretending to know more than they actually do. This could be related to the fact that nearly one in six women said that they considered knowledge about wine to be an attractive trait in a potential partner. A typical restaurant scene, but most people haven't the faintest idea what the label means . While avoiding the cheapest wine on the list in a restaurant might seem as if you know something about wine - you have been rumbled. One in five of us use the trick of ordering the second-cheapest wine on the menu in an attempt to seem more informed. Across the country, Londoners were found to be the most confident overall (37 per cent) but ironically were also the greatest bluffers about of wine (19 per cent). At the other end of the spectrum, drinkers in the East Midlands are the least confident, with a significant four out of five (82 per cent) drinkers admitting to their lack of confidence in their wine knowledge. Cheers darling - and let's just pretend we know all about this lovely wine we're drinking . Nearly a third of drinkers said they would be more experimental with their wine choices if they knew more about wine. Ian Harris, chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Education Trust, said: 'There’s no shame at all in not knowing much about the wine in your glass, but it’s a real shame if a lack of confidence means you can’t enjoy it fully.'","70% of Brits lack confidence in choosing and recommending a bottle .

"By . Tara Brady . Cleared: Kishore Nimmala was cleared  of theft today after his first date with Fakhara Sultana which went wrong . An IT worker accused of snatching a woman’s mobile phone on their first date to ‘teach her a lesson’ when she refused to pay half of the drinks bill was cleared of theft today. Kishore Nimmala, 32, was said to be furious after Fakhara Sultana told him she had no cash during a romantic rendezvous at the Ruby Blue Bar in Leicester Square. Nimmala spent £54 on two rounds of drinks before insisting she should contribute, Southwark Crown Court heard. But Ms Sultana, who met Nimmala on dating website Zoosk, assumed that he would be coughing up the cash for everything during their date. Jurors heard she cut the evening short after Nimmala became agitated, but he was said to have pestered her for cash as she walked to Charing Cross Tube station. He was then alleged to have seized her white Blackberry mobile phone on February 15 this year. But a jury cleared Nimmala of theft after deliberating for just 53 minutes following a three-day trialNimmala said he took Ms Sultana’s phone thinking she would give him £25, but insisted he never intended to keep the device. Helen Thomas, prosecuting, previously told the court: 'This case is about a first date that goes badly wrong. 'Ms . Sultana informed to defendant that she didn’t have any money with her . and that she had assumed that he would be paying for the evening. 'At that point the defendant became angry and so their evening together came to an abrupt close.' Scene: The Ruby Blue Lounge in Leicester Square where Kishore Nimmala went on a first date with Fakhara Sultana . The couple then made their way to Charing Cross station with Nimmala allegedly badgering his date for her share of the cash on the way. The court heard that when Ms Sultana took her phone from her bag, Nimmala 'grabbed it' and ran. Two police officers, who were on Charing Cross Road, joined the chase and caught up with Nimmala on St Martin’s Lane before they witnessed him throw the phone away. The court heard that Nimmala does not deny taking the phone without permission, but that the issue is whether or not he did so dishonestly and with the intention to permanently deprive her of the device. Nimmala, of Leyton, east London, denied theft. Hearing: Nimmala denied one count of theft at Southwark Crown Court .","Kishore Nimmala was furious when he discovered his date had no cash .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The Conservatives have surged into a lead in the opinion polls for the first time in two years. David Cameron's party is now two points ahead of Labour as Ed Miliband faces growing pressure that voters do not seem him as the next Prime Minister. It is a major boost for the Prime Minister who spent the day on the campaign trail with Boris Johnson, with the two men winning a game of table football, a victory for what Mr Cameron called the Blue Team. The Blue Team: David Cameron and Boris Johnson tried their hand at table football on a visit to Harrow Skills Centre . The Tory duo celebrate their victory, as Mr Cameron faced more questions about getting his 'star player' back on the Conservative frontbench in Parliament . As the PM faced fresh questions about Mr Johnson's ambitions, he put the London Mayor on defensive duties for the football match . A new poll by Lord Ashcroft puts the Tories two points ahead for the first time in two years . According to a new survey by Lord Ashcroft Polls, 34 per cent of people say they will back the Tories at the next general election, with only 32 per cent supporting Labour. Ukip is backed by 15 per cent, with the Lib Dems on just 9 per cent. A separate poll for the Guardian found 33 per cent of voters now back the Tories - two points ahead of Labour on 31 per cent. According to the Guardian/ICM survey, Labour support is evaporating. Support for the party has dropped by six points since April - its lowest since June 2010 after Gordon Brown lost the election. Nigel Farage's Ukip is on 15 per cent - with the Lib Dems on just 13 per cent. The polls are the first time the Tories have been ahead since before the disastrous 'omnishambles' Budget, which saw George Osborne lambasted for taxes on pasties, caravans and chickens. The survey also found Mr Cameron is the only leader who is rated more highly than his party. It follows other polls which show that while two-thirds of people back Labour policies, fewer than a quarter think Mr Miliband is up to the job of being Prime Minister. With less than a year until the general election and the economy showing strong signs of growth, Mr Cameron will be buoyed by the first poll since 2012 showing the Tories ahead. It is also likely to cause further dismay in the Labour party, with those around Mr Miliband fearing he is failing to cut through with voters. Pollster Lord Ashcroft, a former Tory donor, insisted the survey was not linked to his political affiliations. 'Those who are not familiar with my research may think it is more than a coincidence that a Tory like me should produce the first Conservative lead in a national survey for more than two years. 'Regular readers, I hope, would point them to my previous polling and commentary, in which I have not shied away from pointing out uncomfortable truths to all parties.' David Cameron has become adept at taking 'selfies' since he was famously snapped grinning for a picture with Danish PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt and US President Barack Obama at Nelson Mandela's funeral . The Prime Minister was joined by the London Mayor Boris Johnson on the campaign trail in Harrow town centre, in north west London. Both politicians were inundated with requests for 'selfies' from voters . The PM posed for a 'selfie' last week with diners at a Nandos in Bristol, where he had stopped with aides for chicken and a glass of red wine. Mr Cameron was happy to stop for more snaps with voters today . Mr Cameron appeared to put aside any security fears on his visit to Harrow in north west London as he was swamped by shoppers looking for a picture with the Prime Minister . Today Mr Cameron hit the campaign with Mr Johnson, widely seen as a rival for the Tory leadership. In an attempt to present a united front, the took on - and beat - youngsters in a game of table football. Mr Cameron wrote on Twitter: 'Together on the Blue Team. Amazingly, Boris and I managed to win a game of table football at Harrow Skills Centre.' In a bizarre series of photo opportunities,  the pair also visisted a factory, a building and a market stall, where Mr Cameron said 'Boris [got] his wallet out as we stop for some fruit and veg in Harrow'. They then travelled back to central London on the Underground together. The PM was forced to deny being frustrated at Mr Johnson's failure to declare whether he will try to become an MP again at the next election. 'I don't think it's time for that yet,' Mr Cameron said as he faced repeated questions on the issue as the pair toured a skill centre and met shoppers in north west London. 'Boris has got vital work to do as Mayor of London. All I am saying is that the options are open to him.' In a series of bizarre photo opportunities, Mr Johnson tried his hand at mixing concrete . Mr Johnson took charge of the shovel, while the Prime Minister looked on . On a visit to Harrow Skills Centre, the Tory duo did their best to demonstrate woodwork skills . Mr Cameron has described Mr Johnson - among the favourites to succeed him as Conservative leader - as a star striker missing from his team. 'It's not a question of keeping me waiting,' he told ITV London News afterwards. 'I have an excellent team of cabinet ministers, we have a very clear plan - particularly the economic plan - to keep putting in place between now and the general election and when Boris makes his decision about whether to come back to Parliament or not, he will be welcome as part of the team.' He added: 'We have always worked very closely together and Boris has done a fantastic job as mayor. 'I know he wants to complete his term. I hope he will also though be returning to the House of Commons and...be one of the players on the pitch.' Mr Cameron asked if any of the strawberries were English, but was told they were all Spanish. 'We're all European now, aren't we?' the trader said . After a day of presenting a united front on the campaign trail, Mr Johnson and Mr Cameron travelled back to London on the tube . David Cameron and Boris Johnson took the tube back to Westminster after visiting Harrow and meeting shoppers . The Mayor of London and Prime Minister - old friends and rivals from school at Eton and university at Oxford - shared some blueberries on the underground on their way back from the Harrow Skills Centre in north west London . Boris Johnson offered one passenger, who found herself sitting next to the London Mayor and Mr Cameron, some of the blueberries he shared with the PM . Mr Johnson - whose term runs to 2016 but would be allowed to continue at City Hall at the same time as serving as an MP - has been linked with a series of safe Conservative seats. But the former MP for Henley has continually ducked demands to declare his intent to stand in the 2015 general election or in a by-election before then. Earlier, Mr Cameron had stood on watching while Mr Johnson tried his hand at mixing concrete, telling him: 'You show me how it's done.' He joked that there were 'a few people' he would willingly bury in some of the finished product. During a walkabout on a busy shopping street in Harrow-on-the-Hill, Mr Cameron asked a stall holder if he had any English strawberries - but was told they were all Spanish. 'We're all European now, aren't we?' the trader said during the campaign visit ahead of European Parliament and local elections on May 22.","Conservatives 34%, Labour 32%, Ukip 15%, Lib Dems 9%, says poll .

"By . Deni Kirkova . Once a rare sight, spotting a tattoo on a female ankle or shoulder has become an ubiquitous part of modern life. But as this stunning collection of images shows, getting inked isn't quite the modern phenomenon it's often thought to be. While tattoos are a relatively recent phenomenon in Europe and the US, body art has long been part of Polynesian culture and has also been found on the mummified remains of Ancient Egyptian priests and priestesses. Now, the 5,000-year-old history of tattooing has been brought to life in a fascinating new exhibition at the Musée du Quai Branly, which charts the evolution of body art over the centuries. Scroll down for video . In Oriental, African and Pacific cultures, tattoos have a social, religious and mystical role in their communities . Although tattoos first made an appearance on the bodies of neolithic men and woman and again in the woad etchings of Iron Age Britons, they didn't reappear in Western culture until the 19th century and the first recorded body art craze which originated in Victorian high society. Popularised by 19th century explorers returning home to the UK full of tales about the weird and wonderful tattooed women they saw on their travels, tattoos swiftly became the accessory of choice for upper class women. Such was the intensity of the craze for body art during the Victorian period, even Queen Victoria is believed to have had one in the form of a Bengal tiger fighting with a python . By contrast, in many Oriental, African and Pacific cultures, tattoos have long played a significant part in the religious and ceremonial life of communities - and continue to do so in some. In the West, however, tattoos were seen as marginalising and were often used to mark slaves or stigmatise wrongdoers, as was the case with Colbert's Code noir (black code) in France, which marked criminals and prostitutes. European sailors in the 1700s got tattoos to mark the lands they had voyaged to: a turtle meant he'd passed the Equator, an anchor signified he had crossed the Atlantic . Captain Costentenus tattooed by order of Yakoob Beg © Fonds Dutailly, City of Chaumont . Portrait of an Algerian woman from the Collection of the artist Marc Garanger . At the beginning of the 1830s in North America, sideshows set up their caravans around the big top of travelling circuses. They were the itinerant expression of the dime museum, where fairground attractions and anatomical phenomena were exhibited: the armless and legless man, the bearded lady and the person tattooed 'from head to toe'. In these antechambers of the sensational, which often employed seasonal or itinerant tattooers, the tattooed performer moreover became a sword-swallower, an animal-tamer, a fireeater, a telepathist, a wrestler, a knifethrower. Meanwhile Europe, which had always been fond of 'curiosities' in which the marvellous, the farce and scientific illusions merged, welcomed these artists with open arms. Thanks to these performers, the spectacle of the tattooed body entered its golden age at the start of the 20th Century. Less willing to embrace the art, Christianity outlawed tattooing. It was prohibited in Leviticus and the New Testament, then officially repressed in 787 by the second Council of Nicaea. It was still practiced, however, by pilgrims in the Middle Ages and even today by the Copts, Armenians and Christians of the Holy Land. The progression of the ink on skin culture is now displayed chronologically for the first time in a stunning new French book, translated Tattoo, Tattooed . From full body intricate patterns to colourful, bold, tattoo sleeves, the possibilities for body art are now endless and the creativity seemingly knows no bounds . Yantra: Muay Thai boxer, bangkok Courtesy Galerie Olivier Waltman © Cedric Arnold . But all that changed in the 1700s, when tattoos came to be seen as a mark of rebellion and free-thinking, and were adopted by bohemian society as well as members of the armed forces. Sailors, in particular, got tattoos to mark the lands they had voyaged to: a turtle meant crossing the Equator, an anchor signified he had traversed the Atlantic, while a dragon symbolised he had travelled East. By the end of the 19th century, tattoos had become part of mainstream society, although some still retained their original connotations. A particularly noxious part of Victorian Britain was the kidnap and forcible tattooing of women, who were then press-ganged into work as circus attractions. Although the popularity of tattooing remained buoyant throughout the 1920s, 30s and 40s, the post-war period saw inking consigned to the wilderness once more. Left to languish in the fashion wilderness for nearly 40 years, the tattoo next staged a comeback in the 1970s, when they were claimed by the nascent feminist movement before becoming part of the body-conscious beautifying of the 1980s and then gaining mainstream status in the 1990s.

"By . Nicholas Whittaker . Man problem: Peyronie's disease leads to abnormal curvature, indentations and shrinkage of the penis . A jab used for ‘claw hand’ may offer hope to male patients suffering a common cause of sexual dysfunction. Peyronie’s disease (PD) is caused by the growth and hardening of fibrous plaques in the soft tissue of the penis, leading to abnormal curvature, indentations and shrinkage. The condition affects up to ten per cent of men, mostly white and over 40, though some are as young as 18. It is considered problematic enough . for treatment only if the abnormal curvature is more than 30 degrees – . as more than this might mean intercourse is painful for both partners, . or impossible. The drug . Xiapex, also known by US brand name Xiaflex, is a recognised therapy for . Dupytren’s Contracture, otherwise known as claw hand, a condition in . which similar fibrous plaques prevent the straightening of the fingers. Famous Dupytren’s sufferers include Margaret Thatcher. The . active ingredient in Xiapex, collagenese, is a natural enzyme which . breaks down excess collagen. It is administered in a series of . injections into the plaque, while massaging is used to encourage the . break up of problem tissue. After . effects can include bruising and swelling, and to eliminate the risk of . accidental ruptures that would lead to permanent erectile dysfunction, . it can be administered only by experienced urologists trained in its . application. Xiapex was . granted approval in the US for treatment of PD last year. Its safety and . effectiveness were established in two randomised double-blind, . placebo-controlled studies in 832 men. Participants were given up to . four treatment cycles of Xiapex or a placebo and were then followed for . 52 weeks. The drug treatment significantly reduced curvature deformity . and related problems. The European rights to Xiapex were . originally licensed to Pfizer, which has since given up options on the . drug. It has now been picked up by Swedish pharmaceutical group Sobi, . which is seeking a European licence for use in PD. However, the drug . company wranglings have been a setback. The . only treatment currently sanctioned by the National Institute for . Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is shockwave therapy, using targeted . sonic pulses. Man woes: If the abnormal curvature of the penis is more than 30 degrees intercourse might be is painful for both partners, or impossible . Reports . indicate a 50 per cent success rate in breaking up the plaque. Although . NICE is satisfied the procedure is safe, experts remain divided. Surgery . is another option but this often leads to shortening of the penis by an . inch on average and is not commonly offered on the NHS, as the . condition is benign. The cost privately is about £4,000. Xiapex is also expensive. It is estimated it would cost £2,000 for enough to treat PD. Dr Martin Gelbard, clinical trial investigator in the department of urology at the University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine, said: ‘In my practice, treating PD has been a challenge as, until now, we have had few options to offer our patients. 'I believe [Xiapex] is a significant achievement and offers a new option for urologists: the first approved treatment to be administered non-surgically that is proven safe and effective for this physically and psychologically devastating disorder.’ Suks Minhas, a consultant at London Urlogy Associates, welcomes the innovation, saying: ‘I’d like to be able to offer my patients an alternative to surgery.’ A range of alternative treatments, including supplements and mechanical gadgets, are offered by small companies on the internet but Suks Minhas, a consultant at London Urology Associates, urges caution. ‘For anyone who suspects they may have Peyronie’s, the first port of call should always be a GP or a qualified urologist,’ he says.","A jab used to treat 'claw hand' can now be used for Peyronie's disease (PD)

"Orchidée is the latest buzzword when it comes to colour . By . Bianca London . Remember the term 'Normcore'? We reported on it a couple of weeks ago - the bland fashion uniform consisting of plain . tees, comfortable shoes, understated anoraks and dad jeans? Just got your fuzzy fashion head around that? Well sorry to break it to you, but it's already old news in the fast-paced and fickle world of fashion, where buzzwords come and go quicker than you can say Cara Delevingne. From Haçienda charm and HEAD, to sliders and arm party, FEMAIL has compiled a guide to SS14's fashion jargon so you don't get caught out. FigureHEAD: Footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has been cited as a key example of someone who is a HEAD - that's a 'high earner, awful dresser' - and a new fashion term to drop this season . HEAD is one of fashion writer Ellie Pither's SS14 lexicons, as cited on the Telegraph, but what on earth does it mean? It simply stands for 'high earner, awful dresser', she explains. She cites Cristiano Ronaldo as the King of HEAD, and we think Simon Cowell, Ashton Kutcher and Peter Crouch fit the bill, too. Then there's Haçienda (a Spanish word for estate) charm, which alludes to the Madchester years in the Eighties/Nineties, when the Haçienda, situated in Manchester, was the world's biggest nightclub - but don't expect to see any white gloves. 'The term will evoke floppy wide-brimmed hats, bejewelled earrings and chic little raffia clutches, rather than acid rave and/or house music,' Ellie writes. Oh dear: Sorry, Simon Cowell, left, and Ashton Kutcher, right, you are both HEADs (high earner, awful dresser) Hacienda charm: Penelope Cruz is the obvious Spanish-ista, but look to Sofia Vergara, left, for that tall, Spanish elegance that oozes sex appeal this season, avoid going over the top a la Kate Upton, right, though . 'Expect to see a lot more of this term as we approach June, and the Brazilian World Cup - fashion likes to be culturally sensitive, after all,' she writes. 'It's all about Spanish chic,' adds fashion writer Simon Glazin. 'Think sexy, hourglass shapes, fishtail dresses, which evoke all the charm of a Flamenco dancer and jangly jewellery that lets people know you are arriving five minutes before they see your face. 'Penelope Cruz is the obvious Spanish-ista, but look to Sofia Vergara for that tall, Spanish elegance that oozes sex appeal.' As well as taking inspiration from the stylish Spanish set, we are also going to be looking further afield to South America. On-trend: Victoria Beckham, left, has been championing the Gaucho trend lately, while Burberry introduced orchid at the SS14 show, right . Gaucho, which involves emulating the cowboy style of the 19th century, is wide-leg cropped trousers paired with tailored shirts and coats. Phoebe Philo at Celine, as well as Marc Jacobs and Louis Vuitton, were the first to set the trend, which has been championed by the likes of Victoria Beckham. Rita joins the party: 'Arm party' refers to your ability to mix and match jewellery, like Rita Ora . If you hear the term ‘arm party’, it means you're well-accessorised and have the ability to mix and match your bracelets, watches and rings to perfection. Really want to nail the look? Stacked rings - a la Rita Ora - and layered necklaces will do the trick. While 2013 was all about the pastel pink, Orchidée is the latest buzzword when it comes to colour. Every year, Pantone selects the . colour trend for the next 12 months and 2014 welcomed orchid - the only . hue to embrace this season. Too afraid to go all-out? Incorporate the . shade into your beauty regime instead by opting for orchid nails and, if . you're feeling more daring, lips. Then there's the 'blanket' - and no, we aren't referring to the itchy kind you use for a picnic. Burberry boss Christopher Bailey was the first to champion THAT . blanket coat this season. Bailey sent out all his models wearing wool blanket . ponchos, knitted in muted yellows, reds and blues, patterned in a sort . of Bauhaus Mondrian-inspired geometric way, or with Apache-style zig . zags. Each one was monogrammed with the . initials of the model who wore it (indeed, front-row fodder Cat Deeley, . who named it as her favourite piece from the show, had her eye on Cara . Delevingne's). There were blanket coats, too, and equestrian blanket scarves, which are perfect for the chilly but bright English summers. Blankets go couture: Christopher Bailey sent out all his models wearing wool blanket ponchos at Burberry this season - and we will all be wrapping up like Cara Delevingne, pictured front .

Up to half a million Britons have faulty genes which put them at unusually high risk of developing heart disease or dying  suddenly at a young age, a health charity estimates . Up to half a million Britons have faulty genes which put them at unusually high risk of developing heart disease or dying  suddenly at a young age, a health charity estimates. Years of under-diagnosing inherited heart conditions has seen the estimate shoot up from 380,000, the British Heart Foundation said, creating a deadly legacy that can span generations. The BHF also warned that someone living with an inherited heart condition has a 50 per cent chance of passing it on to their children. Every year around 600 apparently healthy under-35s die of heart attacks, leaving behind shocked and distraught families. Now the BHF has launched its Fight for Every Heartbeat campaign to raise awareness and call for more research into faulty heart genes. BHF medical director Professor Peter Weissberg said: ‘Over recent years researchers have made great strides in identifying some of the genes that cause inherited heart conditions. ‘A genetic test in a child of an affected parent can save their life. More research is now urgently needed to identify all the genes responsible for these deadly disorders. ‘Pinpointing genes which cause these conditions will allow affected children to be protected and, in the long term, will lead to new treatments to overcome the effects of the faulty gene.’ Years of under-diagnosing inherited heart conditions has seen the estimate shoot up from 380,000, the British Heart Foundation said, creating a deadly legacy that can span generations . The campaign, which launches on television and online today, features baby Zara Stroud whose mother Caroline discovered that she had a faulty gene for an inherited heart condition before she became pregnant. She knew that there was a 50:50 chance it could be passed onto her baby. Zara might have the faulty gene but her condition is being monitored.","Every year around 600 apparently healthy under-35s die of heart attacks .

"Everton's Bryan Oviedo misses out because of injury . Costa Rica face England in final group game on June 24 in Belo Horizonte . By . Mike Dawes . Goalkeeper Keylor Navas and forwards Bryan Ruiz and Joel Campbell head the list of players named in Costa Rica's preliminary 30-man squad for next month's World Cup in Brazil. Fulham forward Ruiz has spent the second half of the season on loan at PSV, while Arsenal's Campbell has been at Olympiacos. Costa Rica face England in the final group game in Belo Horizonte on June 24. Leader: Bryan Ruiz has scored 12 times from 61 appearances for Costa Rica . Gunner: Arsenal's Joel Campbell looks set to line up against England . Coach Jorge Luis Pinto resisted naming any major surprises in the lineup and is using the same core of players who helped Costa Rica to qualify as the top team from the CONCACAF region. Pinto said he was happy to stick with his proven players and valued continuity in the team. 'If we have to make changes, we will when the time comes,' Pinto said. He said he will name his final 23-man squad on May 31, before the team travels to the United States for friendlies against Japan and Ireland. World of pain: Bryan Oviedo suffers the broken leg against Stevenage which means he will miss the World Cup . Pinto also confirmed that defender Bryan Oviedo of Everton will miss the cup with a broken left leg. Oviedo was injured in January and was not able to recover sufficiently to make the team. Costa Rica will be a heavy underdog to advance from a group containing England, Italy and Uruguay. The Central Americans will be appearing in their fourth World Cup, but merely picking up a point or two will be difficult against three teams near the top of the FIFA rankings with seven World Cup titles between them. Knocking one of the European giants out of the World Cup and matching its achievement of reaching the round of 16, which happened in 1990, would be a major accomplishment. Squad: . Goalkeepers: Keylor Navas (Levante), Patrick Pemberton (Alajuelense) Daniel Cambronero (Herediano), Esteban Alvarado (AZ Alkmaar). Defenders: Johnny Acosta (Alajuelense), Giancarlo Gonzalez (Columbus Crew), Michael Umana (Saprissa), Oscar Duarte (Bruges), Waylon Francis (Columbus Crew), Heiner Mora (Saprissa), Junior Diaz (Mainz 05), Christian Gamboa (Rosenborg), Roy Miller (Red Bulls), Kendall Waston (Saprissa).

"Andy Murray made the perfect start to his clay-court campaign with a battling victory over Nicolas Almagro in the second round of Mutua Madrid Open. The Scot, who had a first-round bye, had to hang tough in the deciding set on his way to a 6-1, 1-6, 6-4 victory over the world No 24. Murray, who is still searching for a coach to replace Ivan Lendl, next meets Colombia's Santiago Giraldo. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Judy Murray discuss Andy choosing his new coach . Pushed all the way: Andy Murray was made to work for his win over Nicolas Almagro . It was a very tough draw for the Wimbledon champion, who was playing his first match in a month.Almagro is among the most dangerous players in the world on clay, as he showed by beating Rafael Nadal in Barcelona two weeks ago. But the Spaniard is also erratic and, apparently troubled by a foot injury, he offered little in the first set. Murray raced into a 5-0 lead, looking extremely sharp after two weeks training on clay in Valencia, and it was all Almagro could do to avoid a love set. Going the distance: Murray had to play three sets against Almagro in order to earn his win . Job done: Murray is congratulated by Almagro after his win . Murray broke serve again at the start of the second and it looked like it would be a comfortable evening but Almagro gained a foothold with a break back and on that the match turned. The Spaniard sensed an opportunity and began to show just what a talent he is, overpowering Murray with a run of six games in a row. The Scot knew he needed to dig in at the beginning of the decider and he did, saving three break points in the third game. Fightback: Almagro lost the first set but won the second to take the match into a third . Almagro did not drop a point on serve until the eighth game of the set, but Murray kept nudging ahead and he took his chance when his opponent served to stay in the match. It was Murray's first win over a Spaniard on clay since beating Tommy Robredo here in 2009 and arguably one of the best of his career on the red stuff. Murray signed the camera at the end of the match with the word 'Bally' and a heart, a tribute to former British No 1 Elena Baltacha, who died from cancer on Sunday. Master in Madrid:  A general view of Manolo Santana court showing Murray beat Almagro . The pair had known each other since they were part of the same Scottish team as juniors and Murray's mother Judy remained a close friend of Baltacha. Murray took part in a tribute to the 30-year-old in Madrid on Monday, and he told reporters in the Spanish capital: 'It's been a tough 10 days or so. 'I kind of had an idea what was going on with Elena because my mum is obviously very close with her and her husband.' He added: 'It does make you think about things and you do realise how lucky you are, and that the most important thing is your health. He's done it: Murray smiles after winning his men's singles second round tennis match against Almagro . 'The more time that passes the more people will celebrate everything that Bally did because she was a great character, a great person, she got everything she could out of her potential. 'Everyone wants to be Wimbledon champion and to be number one in the world but not everyone can have that. The best thing you can do is achieve your potential and I believe she did that. That's a big credit to her. 'It's something that every single day you're going to think about. But it's just tough for everyone today. I just wanted to try to go out and play and win, and try to enjoy it. Right now is not easy.'","Andy Murray saw off the world No 24 and clay court specialist in impressive fashion .

"By . Alison Smith Squire . Like many identical twins, Jo and Kerry Burton have done everything in sync – from ballet lessons to beating chickenpox. So when Jo decided to have cosmetic surgery on her nose 17 years ago, Kerry followed suit. And since then, the 38-year-olds have spent £70,000 on a host of cosmetic surgeries – all carried out at the same time by the same doctors – to ensure they cannot be told apart. Identical twins Jo (left) and Kerry Burton from Stevenage who have spent over £70,000 on plastic surgery between them . They have had two breast enlargements, identical nose jobs, eye-lifts, tattooed eyeliner, facials, spray tans, manicures and pedicures. Twice a year they even have Botox together – at the same time, naturally, so they age at the same rate. Their most recent operation was in January when they underwent another breast enlargement, going from a DD cup to an E on the same day. Their identical surgeries began when the women, who live within five minutes of one another in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, were just 21. Beautician Kerry, who is the eldest by 15 minutes and mother to Drew, six, and Sienna, three, recalled: ‘Jo said she’d like a curve in her nose. I agreed that our noses were very straight and it seemed natural to go under the knife together.’ And strangely enough, the operations, which cost £2,500 each, both went wrong. ‘The tip of Jo’s nose turned one way and mine went the other,’ said Kerry. So a year later they had joint corrective surgery. However the experience didn’t put them off. In 2004, they both got a breast augmentation costing £4,500 each, to go from a 34B to a 34DD. They have had two breast enlargements, identical nose jobs, eye-lifts, tattooed eyeliner, facials, spray tans, manicures and pedicures . Jo, who lives with partner Andy Ince, 46, and is a full-time mother to Jade, 12, and Evie-May, ten months, said: ‘The surgeon even scribbled our initials on our stomachs so he didn’t get muddled up.’ By the age of 26, the twins were having regular Botox and facials. ‘Always at the same time,’ says Jo, ‘so we age the same way.’ In 2009, at a cost of £300 each, they had eyeliner tattooed on their eyelids, following eye-lifts totalling £6,000. Once again it was Jo’s idea. She said: ‘I noticed a few crow’s feet appearing around my eyes and thought about an eye lift. Kerry agreed and we were delighted with the result.’ After discovering their implants were faulty PIP ones, they replaced them in January this year and went up to an E cup. The operations cost £3,000 each. Kerry: 'We did ballet together and even beat chickenpox together. As toddlers we spoke in our own language that only we could understand' They said their close bond came as no surprise to their parents Valerie and Colin – who had no idea they were expecting two babies until four weeks before they were born. Kerry weighed 6lb 13oz and Jo was 7lb 2oz. Kerry said: ‘Mum did her very best to ensure she could quickly tell us apart. Jo was always dressed in blue and I was in pink. But even as children we wanted to do everything together. ‘We did ballet together and even beat chickenpox together. ‘As toddlers we spoke in our own language that only we could understand. Then at school we’d often swap places. ‘I didn’t like cookery and, as a result, I was hardly ever there.’ They said that as they grow older, they would consider a facelift. However, Jo added: ‘It would have to be joint surgery. ‘We’d never have anything done without the other.’","Twins Jo and Kerry Burton have done everything in sync since birth .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Game Of Thrones heart-throb Kit Harington – who plays raven-haired Jon Snow – has given up bread in his quest to stay in shape. It’s the latest chapter in his diet saga after he piled on two stone for new film Pompeii, then found he had put on too much weight. He had been eating 4,000 calories a day after being told to bulk up. Too bulky, knows nothing: Kit Harrington, who plays Jon Snow on Game of Thrones and Milo in Pompeii, ate 4,000 calories a day to gain muscle for the film, but was told he had gotten 'too big' But when he arrived for filming looking  ‘big and muscly’, he was advised he actually needed to be leaner. It meant Kit, 27, had to starve himself while working out intensely for the required look. He’s now trying to get back to his old shape – and has cut out bread completely. Smaller version: Kit Harrington, pictured last month, is cutting bread to stay slim . ‘You’ve got to do these things to stay slim to be an actor,’ he says. ‘But it’s also better for my body – my digestion, my energy levels and my fitness.’ Hypnotherapy is being used to tackle the chest pain felt in  so-called cardiac syndrome X. Sufferers . – mostly women – experience an intense crushing pain in their chest, . similar to angina or heart attack. But tests find no obvious cause and . drugs fail to stop the debilitating symptoms, leaving patients with . frequent hospital visits, increased psychological illness and poor . quality of life. ‘I see 16 . to 20 patients a week with cardiac syndrome X in my heart clinic and . across the country many go unmanaged,’ says Professor Peter Collins, . consultant cardiologist at Royal Brompton Hospital, where a clinical . trial of hypnotherapy is under way. It follows a pilot study showing that the treatment helped patients  who had suffered chest pain for  up to 14 years. The . cause of cardiac syndrome X is not fully understood, though scanning . research has suggested tiny vessels carrying blood to the heart fail to . open properly, while other theories include changing oestrogen levels . and acid reflux. Almost three-quarters of sufferers have an anxiety . problem. Hypnotherapy has previously been found to help anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome. Playing Scrabble with a romantic partner can significantly lower nicotine cravings while trying to quit smoking. A study of 20 couples, in which at least one partner was trying to give up smoking and suffering nicotine withdrawal, used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to scan participants’  brains while they played a series of different games. Healthy rivalry: Attempting to outsmarten your significant other apparently makes you not want to smoke . During the games that were most . mentally challenging, the participants were found to  have decreased . cravings for nicotine, according to the study at Idaho State University.

"By . Lizzie Parry . For generations men have been brought up to be the perfect gentleman, opening doors for women and walking closer to the kerb to protect companions from the traffic. But the act of being chivalrous could have a detrimental impact on a person's health, as scientists have found air pollution can be up to a third higher at the kerb than on the inside of the pavement. A new study has recommended that people avoid busy streets and junctions altogether to protect their health - and even advised to stay away from the edge of the road to keep out pollution. A new study has found you are more likely to suffer the effects of air pollution if you walk closer to the kerb, rather than if you take a path further from the traffic . Atmospheric consultant Dr Iarla Kilbane-Dawe, who led the study aimed at educating members of the public on the dangers of air pollution, said drivers should close their air vents while in busy traffic to prevent a person inhaling harmful fumes, the Evening Standard reported. She also mentioned previous studies which identified the health benefits of avoiding the kerb, carried out by three scientists at Imperial College London around 2004. He said: 'Walking or cycling along quiet rather than busy roads can reduce your exposure by half or even more, especially if you avoid pollution hotspots at the busiest junctions. 'Even walking further from the kerb on a busy road has been shown to make a difference.' One study recently found that nearly 3,000 Londoners die prematurely each year from the harmful health effects of inhaling polluted air. Further studies by Dr Kilbane-Dawe showed that in parts of the capital exposure to particulate pollution - a harmful mix of brake dust, soot and tyre fragments - is the fifth biggest killer after cancer and heart disease. And in Kensington and Chelsea, as well as places including Bromley and Richmond, death rates relating to pollution were twice as high as death rates from traffic accidents. It comes as the World Health Organisation (WHO) named and shamed British towns and cities for breaching safety levels for air pollution. Nine urban areas - London, Birmingham, Chesterfield, Leeds, Nottingham, Sheffield, Southampton, Stoke-on-Trent and Thurrock - were highlighted by the global health body. WHO said that across the world most cities that measure outdoor air pollution are failing to meet its guidance for safe levels and are putting residents at risk of respiratory disease and other health problems. The research carried out by government advisor, Dr Iarla Kilbane-Dawe found air pollution can be up to a third higher at the kerb than on the inside of the pavement . Overall, only 12 per cent of the people living in cities reporting on air quality reside in places which comply with WHO's safety levels. A spokesman said that it appears that air pollution is 'getting worse'. WHO's air quality database monitors 1,600 regions around the world, including 36 in Britain. Earlier this year it estimated that outdoor air pollution was responsible for the deaths of 3.7 million people globally during 2012. Air pollution is associated with deaths from heart disease and stroke, as well as respiratory illnesses and cancers, a spokesman said. One way to measure air quality is to asses the levels of a type of pollution known as particulate matter (PMs). 'Too many urban centres today are so enveloped in dirty air that their skylines are invisible,' said Dr Flavia Bustreo, WHO's assistant director-general for family, children and women's health. 'Not surprisingly, this air is dangerous to breathe. So a growing number of cities and communities worldwide are striving to better meet the needs of their residents - in particular children and the elderly.' The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated earlier this year that outdoor air pollution was responsible for the deaths of 3.7 million people globally during 2012 . Dr Carlos Dora, coordinator for interventions for healthy environments at WHO's Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health, added: 'We cannot buy clean air in a bottle, but cities can adopt measures that will clean the air and save the lives of their people.' Recently English health officials called on local authorities to do more to protect people from harmful air pollution. Long-term exposure to air pollution led to around 25,000 deaths in England in 2010, Public Health England (PHE) said. PHE said that air quality has improved 'considerably' in the UK in recent decades due to new, cleaner technology and tighter environmental legislation. But it said that local action can be taken to reduce the emissions of these man-made particles and people's exposure to air pollution.","Government-commissioned study pointed out air pollution can be up to a third higher at the kerb than on the inside of the pavement .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Today England manager Roy Hodgson announced his World Cup squad. But how did it compare to popular opinion? One company has picked the starting 11 according to the views of fans on Twitter. By counting the number popular tweets versus negative a players gets, telecommunications firm WDS has put together their own England team. Is this how fans wanted England to line up against Italy in their first game of the Brazil World Cup? It is according to company WDS, who compiled a starting England XI based on each player's popularity on Twitter (denoted by number here) before Roy Hodgson's squad announcement today . The company uses something known as Empath, which they say is a ‘next-generation listening platform.’ 1. Cleverley (no) 2. Carrick (no) 3. Gerrard (yes) 4. Rooney (yes) 5. Sturridge (yes) 6. Barkley (yes) 7. Terry (no) 8. Cahill (yes) 9. Johnson (yes) 10. Cole (no) 11. Hart (yes) It is used to monitor messages on social media. In this case it has been used to keep an eye on Twitter ahead of the England Squad announcement. 'Empath collected tweets that mentioned England players and Hodgson,' the company said in an email. 'For the players, it was trained to recognise the syntax relating to wanting a player in the team as positive and out of the team as negative.' 'To build the England XI we used the volume of positive mentions to reveal the top two rated strikers, the top four rated midfielders, the top four rated defenders and the top keeper.' Looking through the Twitter-picked squad, there are a few surprises. In goal, as has been throughout England’s qualifying campaign and thus expected to start, is Manchester City's Joe Hart. At the back, while Liverpool’s Glen Johnson and Chelsea’s Gary Cahill were picked by Hodgson, John Terry has long been ruled out of England contention. Ashley Cole, meanwhile, today announced his international retirement after being informed by Hodgson he would not be in the squad, although clearly the Twitter users were keen for him to go to Brazil. It's not surprising to see Wayne Rooney (middle) ease his way into the Twitter popularity list, but the omission of Southampton's Luke Shaw (left) and Liverpool's Raheem Sterling (right) is a surprise, although the data was taken a month ago before their late season surges in form . In midfield the Twitter users have picked Liverpool and England captain Steven Gerrard, but their pick of United midfielder Michael Carrick was wide of the mark as he is not in the squad. Ross Barkley, however, was a popular choice as Twitter users back the youngster to make an impact at the World Cup. Perhaps surprisingly is Tom Cleverley’s pick as the number one most popular Twitter player, having been the subject of a fan-led petition to make sure he is not picked for England back in February. Roy Hodgson has not picked Tom Cleverley in his initial squad of 23, although he is on standby. Upfront, meanwhile, Rooney and Sturridge lead England's attack in both the real and Twitter squads. WPS says their team was closely aligned with the bookies’ picks, aside from Terry and Cole’s exclusion. The company also measured the popularity of Hodgson, and found it to be at a rather favourable 100 per cent positive.

'For instance, after the news that Cole didn’t . make the team, initial analysis revealed that 61% of fans thought . Hodgson made the wrong choice (had negative sentiment toward this . decision). 'Within the hour, this dropped to 73 per cent.' At the last World Cup WDS says a record 143,199 tweets per second were posted.

"By . Mark Prigg . Netflix is raising its Internet video prices by $1 per month for new customers, it announced today. The firm said it will give current U.S. subscribers a two-year break from the higher rates. The changes mean anyone signing up for Netflix's video subscription service beginning Friday will pay $9 per month for in the U.S. FILE - In this Friday, Jan. 17, 2014 file photo, a person displays Netflix on a tablet in North Andover, Mass. Netflix is raising its Internet video prices by $1 per month for new customers and giving its current U.S. subscribers a two-year break from the higher rates. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) Netflix this week revealed a push into documentaries, with the subscription service announcing deals on Thursday to premiere four new films in the next few months. The first of the four new films to be released will be 'Battered Bastards of Baseball,' about a defunct minor league baseball team. It will premiere on Netflix on July 11. 'Mission Blue,' a documentary about marine biologist Sylvia Earle and her campaign to create a network of protected marine sanctuaries, is set for Aug. 15. Later this year the service will premiere 'E-Team,' a film about human rights workers from the makers of the Oscar-winning documentary 'Born Into Brothels' and 'Print the Legend,' about 3-D printing. The old price of $8 per month will continue until May 2016 for Netflix's existing 36 million U.S. subscribers. The price increase, Netflix's first in nearly three years, isn't a surprise. The Los Gatos, California-based company disclosed its plans to raise its rates last month without specifying the precise amount. Netflix  says its needs more money so it can afford to pay for more original programming along the lines of its Emmy award-winning political drama House of Cards and critically acclaimed series Orange Is the New Black. The emphasis on video that can only been seen on Netflix has become a major drawing card for the company as it strives to create the Internet's equivalent of Time Warner Inc.'s HBO cable network. By delaying the price increase for current subscribers, Netflix hopes to avoid the backlash that it faced in 2011 when it raised its prices by as much as 60 percent. The company lost about 800,000 customers within a few months in an exodus that alarmed investors, causing Netflix's stock to plunge by more than 80 percent in a year. David Cross, left, and Portia de Rossi in a scene from Arrested Development. The sitcom, also starring Jason Bateman and Will Arnett, was canceled by Fox in 2006 after three seasons - but brought back by Netflix. Netflix eventually lured back subscribers and revived its customer growth, lifting its stock to record highs earlier this year. Netflix's stock rose $2.65 to $324.31 in early afternoon trading Friday. The shares have fallen by 13 percent so far this year. Prices for Netflix's rapidly shrinking DVD-by-mail service aren't changing. Those rates range from $5 to $20 per month, depending on how many DVDs are being rented and whether a Blu-ray option is included. Netflix ended March with 6.7 million DVD subscribers, a nearly 50 percent drop from 2 ½ years ago. New Internet video customers can avoid the higher price if they are willing to settle for a little less clarity and flexibility. Netflix is also introducing a new $8 per month plan that will only show standard-definition video and limit viewership to just one screen.

The company already charges $12 per month for a subscription plan that allows video to be simultaneously streamed on four different screens.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Despite the fact digital cameras are falling by the wayside in favour of smartphones, the technology is taking a little while to catch up. The main reason being that smartphones are much thinner than cameras, and therefore can’t pack in the same quality and size of sensors – until now. Engineers from Israel have designed a dual-lens system that is thin enough to fit in an 9mm smartphone and is capable of achieving an optical zoom five times greater than 3x digital zoom. Engineers from Israel designed the dual-lens system to make it small enough to fit in a smartphone. The technology is capable of achieving an optical zoom five times greater than 3x digital zoom and is also used to create depth of field effects that can be altered after the shot has been taken . Corephotonics’ zoom uses is a dual aperture camera and an image fusion library. The sensor takes two photos from different angles and this library fuses these images together into a single high-quality picture. With the depth of field feature, the sensors take photos and plot various depth points around objects that in shot. It will select what it considers the main focal point, but because it has stored points of the other items, these can be selected and brought into focus at the tap of the screen. This feature is seen on the HTC One M8, for example. This means phone cameras will be able to take crystal-clear images taken from feet away and it could spell the end of blurred and cloudy images often associated smartphones and tablets. The technology was originally showcased by makers Corephotonics during this year’s Mobile World Congress in February. Corephotonics is run by Professor David Mendlovic, an electrical engineer at Tel Aviv University and his former colleague Dr Gal Shabtay. As well as high-quality zooming functions, the dual sensor can also create depth of field effects. By capturing the depths of everything in a photo automatically, this means the focus can be changed during editing – a feature seen on the dual-sensor of the HTC One M8. However, neither company has confirmed that the sensor used in HTC's latest flagship model is the one developed by Corephotonics. Corephotonics' sensor takes two photos from different angles and fuses these images together into a high-quality picture. The left-hand image shows a photo taken with digital zoom on a traditional phone camera. The right-hand image is one taken using Corephotonics' sensor . As well as high-quality zooming functions, the dual sensor can also create depth of field effects. By capturing the depths of everything in a photo automatically, this means the focus can be changed during editing - a feature seen on the dual-sensor of the HTC One M8, pictured . At least one, unnamed, mobile phone manufacturer has already signed up to take the new system from Corephotonics, and others are expected to follow. Professor Mendlovic said: ‘Our technology provides up to three times the zoom factor, has improved low-light performance, and can fit into compact dimensions.’ The first handsets with the new technology are expected to be available at the beginning of next year. ‘If successful, we’ll define a new standard for the next-generation compact camera...resulting in an entirely new user experience,’ continued Professor Mendlovic.","Engineers have designed a dual-lens system thin enough to fit in a mobile .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Nasa has unveiled unprecedented observations of the most powerful type of solar flare that’s ever been recorded. Using multiple observatories, they say the unprecedented images are the best ever taken. And the information could help protect us from solar storms in the future. Scroll down for video . Nasa has released imagery and data from a huge solar flare on 29 March 2014 that was observed by its fleet of spacecraft. This image from the Iris spacecraft shows material some 650 miles above the sun's surface. The vertical line in the middle shows the slit for the spectrograph, which can separate light into its wavelengths . The huge event on the sun occurred on 29 March 2014, but Nasa has only now analysed the data from their fleet of observatories. A solar flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released. Radiation . is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from . radio waves at the long wavelength end, through optical emission to X-rays and gamma rays at the short wavelength end. The amount of energy released is the equivalent of millions of 100-megaton hydrogen bombs exploding at the same time . A . flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar . atmosphere is suddenly released - mostly in the active regions around . sunspots. Their frequency varies from several a day, when the sun is particularly active, to less than one a week during quiet periods. This fleet consisted of four telescopes in space and one observatory on Earth. To have a record of such an intense flare from so many observatories is unprecedented, they say. The observation was all the more incredible as it was only by chance all of the observatories were looking at the same point on the sun at the same time. The flare observed was an X-class flare, the biggest and highest-energy solar flares that have ever been observed. In particular it was an X1 flare, which is the lowest intensity within the X category but significantly more powerful than the majority of flares. ‘This is the most comprehensive data set ever collected by Nasa's Heliophysics Systems Observatory,’ said Jonathan Cirtain, project scientist for the joint US-Japan mission Hinode at Nasa's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. ‘Some of the spacecraft observe the whole sun all the time, but three of the observatories had coordinated in advance to focus on a specific active region of the sun. ‘We need at least a day to program in observation time and the target – so it was extremely fortunate that we caught this X-class flare.’ The telescopes involved were Nasa's Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, or Iris; Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory, or SDO; Nasa's Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager, or Rhessi; the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency's Hinode; and the National Solar Observatory's Dunn Solar Telescope located at Sacramento Peak in New Mexico . This event was particularly exciting for the Nasa’s Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (Iris) team, as this was the first X-class flare ever observed by them. This combined image shows the X-class flare as seen through the eyes of different observatories. The SDO is on the left, which helps show the position of the flare on the sun. The darker orange square is Iris data. The red rectangular inset is from Sacramento Peak. The violet spots show the flare's footpoints from RHESSI . Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), artist's illustration shown, has has been in orbit since 11 February 2010. It will observe the sun until at least 2015, after which its mission could be extended. Its goal is to understand the influence of the sun on Earth and surrounding space by monitoring its atmosphere . Coordinated observations like this are crucial to understanding such eruptions on the sun and their effects on space weather near Earth. Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost. Astronauts . are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this . manned mission. They do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure . during space walks. The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field. Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies. A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced. Geomagnetic . storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater . dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric . currents. Where terrestrial weather watching involves thousands of sensors and innumerable thermometers, solar observations still rely on a mere handful of telescopes. The instruments on the observatories are planned so that each shows a different aspect of the flare at different heights off the sun's surface and at different temperatures. Together the observatories can paint a three-dimensional picture of what happens during any given event on the sun. During this event in the space of just a few minutes, the most comprehensive flare data set of all time had been collected. Now scientists are hard at work teasing out a more detailed picture of how a flare starts and peaks - an effort that will help unravel the origins of these little-understood explosions on the sun. Such research can help scientists better understand what catalyst sets off these large explosions on the sun. Perhaps they may even some day be able to predict their onset and forewarn of the radio blackouts solar flares can cause near Earth - blackouts that can interfere with airplane, ship and military communications. This image from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory shows ultraviolet light. This wavelength of light shows materials with temperatures of about 4500 Kelvin, which highlights the surface of the sun and a low layer of the sun's atmosphere called the chromosphere . This close-up of the sunspot underneath the March 29, 2014, flare shows incredible detail. The image was captured by the G-band camera at Sacramento Peak in New Mexico. This instrument can focus on only a small area at once, but provide very high resolution . The flare is seen here in this image from the SDO just up and right from the centre in the 2-o'clock position. The hottest solar material that SDO can focus in on is 10 million Kelvin. At these temperatures, the blazingly hot solar flare can easily be seen in the upper right of the sun . This data shoes how the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (Goes) recorded the X-class flare. Note the high spike just before 18:00 UTC on March 29. That spike shows how GOES detected a surge in X-rays from the sun, the signature of a solar flare .","Five Nasa observatories have taken unprecedented images of a solar flare .

"By . Mark Prigg . Snapchat has agreed to settle with the Federal Trade Commission over charges that it deceived customers about the disappearing nature of messages sent through its service. The hit app came under fire after it failed to tell users that others could save their messages without their knowledge, and collected users' contacts without telling them or asking permission. The firm today agreed to settle without admitting or denying any wrongdoing and claimed it has already addressed many of the issues the FTC raised. Scroll down for video . Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel in Los Angeles. Snapchat has agreed to settle with the Federal Trade Commission over charges that it deceived customers about the disappearing nature of messages they send through its service and collected users contacts without telling them or asking for permission. Back in February Facebook bought hugely popular messaging app WhatsApp for $19 billion (£11.4 billion), after failing in a previous $3 billion to buy Snapchat. At the start of April, Vine revealed its ‘Vine Messages’ service that enabled users to send messages to each other. This directly followed once-popular social network Bebo’s attempts to get back into the game with Blab, their own video messaging service. Facebook, meanwhile, is busy trying to increase the profile of its Messenger app, with rumours that it will shift WhatsApp users onto its native messaging client. They recently announced a selfie feature for Messenger that makes it easier to send people pictures of yourself. And even Twitter is getting in on the game – it’s rumoured they are considering letting users have secret conversations on the site. As part of the settlement, Snapchat must implement a privacy program that will be monitored by an outside privacy expert for the next 20 years. The arrangement is similar to privacy settlements that Google, Facebook and Myspace have agreed to in recent years. 'If a company markets privacy and security as key selling points in pitching its service to consumers, it is critical that it keep those promises,' Edith Ramirez, the chairwoman for the Federal Trade Commission, said in a statement. 'Any company that makes misrepresentations to consumers about its privacy and security practices risks F.T.C. action.' Although Snapchat said its app notified users when a recipient takes a screenshot of a 'snap' they've sent, the FTC said recipients with an Apple device that runs an operating system that predates iOS 7 could evade the app's screenshot detection. Apple's iOS7 launched last summer. In addition, the FTC said Snapchat's app stored video snaps that were not encrypted on the recipient's device. The videos remained accessible to the recipient, the agency said. A user could access a video message, even after it supposedly disappeared, if the user simply connected the phone to a computer and accessed the video in the device's file directory. The FTC complaint also alleges that Snapchat failed to secure its 'find friends' feature. A security breach in January allowed hackers to collect the usernames and phone numbers of some 4.6 million Snapchat users. To use Snapchat's new Chat feature (pictured) you simply need to swipe right on one of your friend's names in the app's inbox. Messages are deleted when you both quit the chat window . You can activate the front (left) and rear (right) cameras on your device by dragging your finger to the bottom and top of your phone respectively . The breach occurred after security experts warned the company at least twice about a vulnerability in its system. Snapchat later issued an update to its app that fixed the issue and allowed users to opt out of the 'find friends' feature. Snapchat's Android app also transmitted users' location information, the FTC said, even though the company told users it didn't collect such information. The settlement doesn't have a financial component, but if Snapchat is found to violate the agreement, the company could end up paying a civil penalty of up to $16,000 for each violation. The Los Angeles startup reportedly turned down a $3 billion buyout offer from Facebook last fall. In a blog post Thursday, Snapchat said that when its app was being created, 'some things didn't get the attention they could have.' 'When we started building Snapchat, we were focused on developing a unique, fast, and fun way to communicate with photos. 'We learned a lot during those early days. 'One of the ways we learned was by making mistakes, acknowledging them, and fixing them. 'While we were focused on building, some things didn’t get the attention they could have. 'One of those was being more precise with how we communicated with the Snapchat community. 'This morning we entered into a consent decree with the FTC that addresses concerns raised by the commission. 'We are devoted to promoting user privacy and giving Snapchatters control over how and with whom they communicate.' 'One of those was being more precise with how we communicated with the Snapchat community,' the company said in the post. Snapchat, however, said it has since fixed the problems. 'Even before today's consent decree was announced, we had resolved most of those concerns over the past year by improving the wording of our privacy policy, app description, and in-app just-in-time notifications,' the company said. 'And we continue to invest heavily in security and countermeasures to prevent abuse.' The settlement will be formally approved in 30 days once a public comment period ends. The company is based in Los Angeles and is run by Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, two former fraternity brothers at Stanford. The service was first released in 2011 and quickly gained a following among high school students in Southern California. The company does not reveal the number of people currently using its service, but says more than 700 million messages are sent each day.","Snapchat also came under fire for collecting users' contacts without telling them or asking permission .

"By . Emma Innes . Ben O'Neill, 14, had a pioneering and live-saving heart operation last month after a major vessel collapsed . A teenage boy with a rare condition which caused his heart to be twice the normal size has undergone a pioneering world first operation to save his life. Ben O'Neill, 14, went under the knife for ground-breaking keyhole surgery to insert a stent into his heart at the Glenfield Hospital in Glenfield, Leicestershire. Doctors decided to perform the procedure on the youngster after a major blood vessel between his heart and lungs completely collapsed. A team of 20 experts faced a race against time as they battled to save Ben during the five-hour procedure which had never been tried before. Medics inserted a stent into his heart and then used a new valve - taken from the jugular of a Australian cow - to repair his pulmonary artery. Ben has suffered from the rare genetic condition Tetralogy of Fallot for his entire life. The condition resulted in the teen suffering four different heart defects at the same time. But thanks to the pioneering operation, the cricket-mad teenager is now back at the crease and enjoying his new lease of life. He said: ‘I felt that even if it wasn't successful then at least it would benefit other people and I'm glad they can now receive the same treatment. ‘It's great to be back on the cricket pitch again. ‘Before the operation I had to take regular breaks before stopping playing altogether.’ His father, Sean, 48, a small business owner, added: ‘The operation was a world's first, it was amazing what they could do. ‘He was under the knife for five hours, during which they put in a stent and a new valve. ‘The stent . went into his pulmonary artery. Normally if this kind of treatment is . required it is because the artery is blocked due to lack of exercise or . bad diet. ‘They . would then just be opening the artery, but the reason that Ben's was . blocked was that his coronary artery was pushing against it and forcing . it into his breast plate. Ben (pictured after surgery in 2005) was born with a complex heart defect and has had a series of open heart operations. The most recent one was required because a major vessel between his heart and lungs collapsed . During the operation, surgeons inserted a stent into his heart and used a valve from a cow's heart to repair his pulmonary artery. He is pictured with hie parents, Sean and Rebecca and his brother, Sam, 17 . Ben needed surgery because a major blood vessel between his heart and lungs completely collapsed. This was causing him to become very breathless and was putting his life at risk. During the keyhole operation, surgeons inserted a stent into his pulmonary artery to keep it open. They then inserted a new valve which came from an Australian cow. They did not want to carry out another open heart operation for fear of the damage it would cause the muscle, so they had no choices but to perform keyhole surgery. They were so worried that he would suffer a heart attack on the operating table that they had a life support machine ready for him if he needed it. ‘So it is not just a blockage inside the artery, it is something forcing it closed from the outside. ‘His heart was having to work harder to pump the blood and so was growing much bigger than it should have done. ‘The doctors went in via a keyhole and inserted the stent into his pulmonary artery. ‘They then put a new valve inside the stent, which had created a fully open artery. ‘That valve came from the jugular of an Australian cow. They modified it to make it work with humans and then they inserted it into Ben. ‘Turns out you cannot use a British or European cow because of BSE so they are flown from Japan or Australia. ‘It has completely transformed Ben's life, in fact it has saved his life. ‘It's so great now, he was told to stop exercising in winter and now just a few weeks after the op he is playing cricket, back at archery practice and today is playing tennis at school. Since the operation, Ben (pictured in hospital in 2005) says he is able to play sport again without becoming breathless and having to stop . Ben had his first operation at just 10 months old and then had further surgery at six and 11 (pictured) ‘Now he should be able to live a full and normal life, although it's all new ground now.’ Tetralogy of fallot affects just five in 10,000 people and the abnormalities it brings can be fatal. Ben first underwent surgery for the condition when he was just 10 months old, before further surgeries at six and 11. Each of those surgeries was only partly successful, leaving Ben facing another gruelling spell under the knife. He began to complain of breathlessness last autumn while exercising at school near his home in East Leake, Nottinghamshire. After a series of MRI scans medics concluded they had no choice but to operate and Ben went back under the knife on March 11. His mother, Rebecca, 47, a teacher, added: ‘We have had a lot of anxiety about it. ‘You lie awake at night thinking “he has already had three operations, can he really have another?” ‘But we are so happy and grateful for the work the doctors at Glenfield have done. Ben (pictured in hospital in 2005 with his mother and brother) hopes he will now not need and further surgery . Ben's most recent operation was the first of its kind to be carried out. He is pictured in hospital in 2005 . ‘When they said he was completely better we almost didn't believe them - I don't think it has sunk in yet.’ Cardiologist . Dr Frances Bu'Lock said the keyhole procedure had enabled her team to . treat Ben's problem without damaging the heart muscle. It was the first time the procedure had been attempted without opening up the chest. Dr Bu'Lock said: ‘Ben is the first person in the world to have this type of procedure performed this way. ‘It was a team effort and we're very pleased to hear how much of an improvement Ben has noticed since. ‘It became clear the blockage was due to muscle thickening which hadn't been cut away as it contained one of the arteries supplying the heart muscle with oxygen. ‘Doing a fourth open heart operation to deliberately cut away the muscle containing the blood vessel had a very high risk of death or heart muscle damage.’ Tetralogy of Fallot is a group of four structural abnormalities within the heart that occur together. These are: . Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart disease. Babies with the condition will need surgery to correct their heart abnormalities. Before surgery, they often appear blue and are prone to fainting. About 98 per cent of children with the condition survive and go on to have a good quality of life.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Could autonomous drones be used to transport hazardous materials to safety? That’s what engineers at Imperial College London are aiming for with their newest project, which uses robotic drones to move objects. And they say their system could be used to safely dispose of objects such as nuclear waste containers in the future. Scroll down for video... A team of engineers led by Dr Mirko Kovac at the Aerial Robotics Laboratory at Imperial College London have revealed their flying robots that can transport nuclear waste containers to safe locations by spraying them with foam and then carrying them away . The team is led by Dr Mirko Kovac, director of the Aerial Robotics Laboratory. The flying 3D-printer and collection system consists of two robots. One robot is a quadcopter with four blades, which is used to dispense polyurethane foam through a nozzle. Through a system of 16 infrared cameras, the robot then ‘prints’ the foam onto the target, such as a nuclear waste-filled container. Next the second, a hexacopter with six blades, steps in. On the bottom of this drone is a flat surface which the foam previously laid by the first robot adheres to when it lands on the target. This drone then flies away with the object, taking it to a safe location. This method allows a wide array of objects to be collected, no matter the shape. The project is known as ‘3D printing with flying robots' and has been in developed over the past 12 months, starting life as a tank-like robot before taking to the skies. The group has developed flying drones that work in tandem to print sticky foam on an object and then carry it away. One robot sprays a target with foam, and another lands on it and sticks to it. It then takes off and transports the target to a safe distance. This target could be a container with nuclear waste inside, that would be hazardous for humans to handle. Although the system requires some manual input for now, in the future the team hopes to allow the robots to perform the entire task of autonomously detecting, spraying and collecting an object themselves. This is a first step towards a concept of a robotic 'nest' say the engineers, where in principle a robot can construct a platform and use it to extend its range by landing to recharge, or collect and deliver objects. ‘This is an exciting first step in the lab's development of cooperative robotic systems for building structures inspired by the natural world, in this case bird nesting behaviour,’ says Thomas Creedy, ecologist at the Natural History Museum who works with the Aerial Robotics Lab. ‘The aim is that these systems will enable a wide range of robotic applications, in particular extending the operating scope of scientific survey robots in challenging environments such as rainforests through the adaptable construction of recharging platforms or monitoring stations.’ The two drones, one a quadcopter (four blades) and the other a hexacopter (six blades), work in tandem to move a target. The first sprays it with foam (pictured), and the second then sticks to it before flying away . As the concept is developed, project lead Dr Kovac envisages a future where such robots roam freely in the wild. ‘Swarms of flying robots will inhabit natural and urban areas as living sensor nodes that will be able to interact with the environment and move in varied terrain effectively,’ he says. ‘They will build nests to recharge their batteries with solar cells and to observe the environment. 'Like in nature, the robots will have specialised functions and division of labour. 'Using swarm intelligence, the robots will be able to perform very complex tasks of autonomous inspection and aerial construction effectively. 'For example, inspection drones will create a 3D scan to detect damage in hazardous environments and a second swarm of construction drones will selectively repair the structure with aerial 3D printing. 'The robots can detect and repair structural damage of hard to reach areas such as wind turbine blades, in nuclear reactors and in oil pipelines. 'Other applications include the protection of the environment and natural habitats, early detection of forest fires, monitoring of pollution levels and humanitarian aid in search and rescue scenarios. 'The next step will be to use swarms of 3D scanning and 3D printing robots to repair damaged structures with very high efficiency.' Dr Kovac envisages a future where 'swarms of flying robots will inhabit natural and urban areas as living sensor nodes that will be able to interact with the environment and move in varied terrain effectively' and sees this project as an important step in that direction . Dr Kovac also reveals how they took inspiration from wildlife, such as swiftlets, to develop the robots. 'Biological inspiration is key to build truly innovative technical solutions,' he explains. 'We take inspiration from nest-building swiftlets that use saliva to build structures. 'We analyse and implement the underlying design principles that allows them to build nest very effectively. 'We don’t copy nature, we use the same principles and implement them using the best of robotic engineering.' This is the first major output from the Aerial Robotics Lab, a relatively new research group at Imperial College London. They say they have 'many new and exciting robotic developments' currently in construction. The lab will be displaying some of their work, including these flying robots, at the Imperial Festival at Imperial's South Kensington campus, London this coming 9 and 10 May.","A team of engineers have created what they call 'flying 3D printing robots'

It . looks similar to the golden hamster commonly found in pet stores, but . is a wild creature that spends the majority of its times burrowing and . living underground. It digs burrows in the fields of wheat and alfalfa because it feeds on the crops and uses them to hide from predators. The belly of the Great Hamster is usually lighter in colour than the back, which is typically black. The male is a reddish-brown, with white spots found on the end of its legs. It is also larger than common hamsters - grows around 10 inches tall - and is closer in size to the guinea pig. Source: The Grand Hamster Alsace . Only 1,000 of the threatened hamsters are thought to exist in the wild. They grow to 10 inches long and are recognised by their brown and white face, black belly, white paws and small round ears. The European Court of Justice has already ruled that France has not done enough to save the rodent. The five-year project will see farmers in Alsace try to encourage the reproduction of the Great Hamster of Alsace. They aim to raise the population to around 1,500. As part of the €3 million (£2.5million) project announced by Alsace’s regional council, farmers have pledged to grow plants or grains that the rodent feeds on. An action plan for the hamster had been put in place in 2007, but the European Court of Justice ruled in 2011 that France was still not doing enough to protect the animal, which hibernates for six months and spends the vast majority of its life alone. Only 1,000 of the threatened hamsters, pictured, are thought to exist in the wild. The European Court of Justice has already ruled France has not done enough to save the rodent.

The hamster has been protected legally since 1993, but its numbers fell from 1,167 in 2001 to as few as 161 in 2007, although they have since gone up slightly. The preferred grazing of the creature - forage crops such as alfalfa - have largely been replaced by the more profitable maize, which it does not like. Farmers will therefore try planting a mix of maize and alfalfa, or leaving strips of plants in between each line of maize. ‘The aim is to find innovative... practices to preserve the animal without harming farmers’ activities,’ the regional council said in a statement. Rampant urbanisation has also contributed to eroding the rodent’s population, and the hamster currently lives in just 14 zones in Alsace criss-crossed by busy thoroughfares.","The Great Hamster of Alsace is an endangered rodent species from France .

"By . Damien Gayle . An estate agent was so fed up with the potholes scarring the streets of his city he decided to fill one himself - with a small tree. Kurt Flock from Indianapolis, Indiana, was sick of seeing no action despite repeatedly reporting potholes to the city's online reporting system. So he took a pot plant, wandered out to the middle of Massachusetts Avenue, and planted the thing right in the middle of the street. Scroll down for video . Vigilante road repair: Kurt Flock walks out with the small tree he has chosen to beautify Massachusetts Avenue . Guerilla gardening: Having placed the plant into the pothole, he adds more soil to keep it in place . Good job! Mr Flock stops to admire his handiwork, which has at once repaired the hole and brightened up the city . My work here is done: Mr Flock strides away, and into infamy as city officials take offence to his public-spiritedness . After getting a friend to film the vigilante road repair, he turned the video into a mock campaign film exhorting fellow citizens to 'adopt a pothole' and fill in some of the many which are plaguing the city. But officials were not impressed with Mr Flock's film, and have threatened him with legal action unless he agrees to remove references to city hall from the online clip. Mr Flock's stunt comes as Indianapolis is in the midst of a pothole crisis. A particularly severe winter has ravaged the city's streets and while, the city has approved $8million to repair roads, that's well short of the $24million its estimated is needed. So the parody video appears to have touched a rather raw nerve with city officials. Mr Flock told wthr.com reporter Mary Milz: 'There wasn't a lot of thought behind it. There was a pothole and a plant and I thought this might be fun.' Mr Flock's video urges fellow citizens to 'adopt a pothole', with a message that reads: 'Volunteers pitch in to fill $16million funding gap in Indy's lame pot hole repair program. 'Citizens are planting shrubs and trees in intersections & streets throughout the city. 'Mayor Ballard & City County Council leaders lauded the effort as a fine example of the public/private partnerships that make Indy a great place to live.' It then shows the scene as Mr Flock walks out into the middle of Massachusetts Avenue and plants a small tree in a deep pothole close to a junction. It again exhorts viewers to 'adopt a pothole today!' before adding the phone number for the Mayor's Action Centre and the web address of the city's pothole reporting service. Mr Flock said of the film: 'I was clearly having fun, but this is a serious issue.' That final message that is the one that has irked Indianapolis council officials. They say it implies that the parody is in fact a real, council-sponsored campaign and they have ordered Mr Flock to take it down. But he remains steadfast: 'I'm not going to take it down. If they put me in jail for civil disobedience, hopefully something good happens.'","Kurt Flock from Indianapolis was fed up with reporting potholes to the city .

"By . Carol Driver . The future King could be visiting the former home of The King of rock and roll this weekend – as Prince William and a newly single Prince Harry are expected to jet into Memphis for a close friend’s wedding. The royal brothers are reportedly flying to the US to attend London nightclub owner Guy Pelly’s nuptials on Saturday to American-born Elizabeth Wilson - the granddaughter of Holiday Inn founder Kemmons Wilson. After a successful three-week trip to New Zealand and Australia, it’s believed Kate and Prince George will be staying in the UK. Double trouble: William and Harry are expected to jet off together to Memphis this weekend . Wedding venue: The Memphis Hunt and Polo club where Guy Pelly is to marry Elizabeth Wilson on Saturday . Close friends: The royal brothers are expected to attend the wedding of Guy Perry and Elizabeth Wilson . And Cressida Bonas, who was expected to attend, will no longer be joining the brothers after her split from Prince Harry was revealed yesterday. Taking place on Saturday, the high-society wedding ceremony is being held at the private Memphis Hunt and Polo Club in Tennessee - in 200 acres of landscaped countryside – which is close to the bride’s family home. However, the three-day celebrations – of which William and Harry are said to be attending two – are expected to start on Friday night, with a visit to the former home of Elvis Presley, Graceland. The iconic property, which has been a tourist attraction for 32 years, has helped transform the city into a top destination for music fans, with more than 18 million visitors through its doors.

The royals will have the chance to have a tour of Graceland, wandering the Jungle Room, with its green shaggy carpets, the Trophy Building which houses all The King’s awards, as well as the luxury living room – all decorated with furnishings from the eras Elvis lived in the property. They will wander the nine-bedroom colonial revival-style mansion, where the All Shook Up star lived with his family for 20 years – buying it for his parents for $100,000 in 1952. Elvis died on August 16, 1977, and by the early 1980s, Graceland had become a burden on his estate, but his wife Priscilla Presley secured an investment, promising to keep the singer’s legacy alive. William, Harry and the Pelly wedding party are also expected to head to Beale Street in downtown Memphis to dine and have drinks. The road, which had been known for the blues since the early 1900s, is now a bustling tourist attraction, featuring music-themed bars, shops and restaurants. The princes have reportedly been told to keep a low profile during the trip. Nightclub entrepreneur Guy Pelly is reportedly considered a ‘bad influence’ on Prince Harry, and even arranged the Duke of Cambridge’s stag do.

"By . Mia De Graaf . and Lucy Crossley . A vintage sofa that belonged to the real-life Mr Darcy from Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice has sold for more than twice its estimate bid at £2,300. The George III mahogany framed sofa is thought to have belonged to Thomas Lefroy, a love interest of the famous author who is believed to have provided the inspiration for romantic hero Mr Darcy. The upholstered Art Nouveau piece was expected to sell for just £1,000 . at Moore Allen & Innocent in Cirencester but today shocked . collectors as a fan took it for £2,300. For sale: The sofa that belonged to Thomas Lefroy, who is thought to have been the inspiration for Mr Darcy . Courtship: Austen (left) and Lefroy (right) were both 20 when they began a whirlwind courtship in 1796, the year Pride and Prejudice was written . Inspiration: Lefroy is thought to have inspired the character of Mr Darcy in Pride And Prejudice, played in the 1995 BBC series by Colin Firth . Austen and Lefroy were both 20 when they began a whirlwind courtship in 1796, the year Pride and Prejudice was written. However, the flirtation ended swiftly when the law student was called to the Bar in Ireland. A fictitious account of their relationship is at the centre of the 2007 historical romance film Becoming Jane, in which Lefroy is played by actor James McAvoy. Despite settling down with a wife in Ireland, he did later admit to his nephew that he had loved Austen, but stated that it was a 'boyish love'. Owner: The George III mahogany framed sofa is thought to have belonged to Lefroy, a love interest of the famous author . Design: The sofa is upholstered in Art Nouveau style fabric over a fluted show frame on eight tapering legs . Home: Lefroy, who went on to become the Lord Chief Justice for Ireland, built his own stunning castle-like home, Carrigglas Manor in County Longford . History: It is believed the settee was purchased for one of the extravagant rooms of the manor house . Heirloom: It is believed that after Lefroy's death in 1869 the sofa, manor house, and contents of the property were passed down through the family . Lefroy, who went on to become the Lord Chief Justice for Ireland, built his own stunning castle-like home, Carrigglas Manor in County Longford, and it is believed the settee was purchased for one of the extravagant rooms. The sofa is upholstered in Art Nouveau style fabric over a fluted show frame on eight tapering legs. It is believed that after his death in 1869 the sofa, manor house, and contents of the property were passed down through the family. Film: A fictitious account of their relationship is at the centre of the 2007 historical romance film Becoming Jane, in which Lefroy is played by actor James McAvoy and Austen by Anne Hathaway . After the landmark sale, auctioneer Philip Allwood said: 'We had huge international interest, especially from the States, where they're big on all things Austen. 'It was a nice sofa anyway, but anything to do with Jane Austen was going to create some sort of wider interest. 'I was listening to a radio play about them meeting this week and it was weird thinking, ""I've got his sofa in the auction house.""' Despite giving over pages and pages to the vivid description's of her character's complicated love lives, Jane Austen herself never experienced much in the way of romance. The author never married and when she died a spinster in July 1817 she left most of her money to her sister Cassandra. Perhaps driven by the romance of her novels, many academics and fans of the novelist have speculated that she had come close to marrying Thomas Lefroy, who was introduced to Austen by his aunt Anne. Austen wrote two letters to Cassandra in January 1796 mentioning Lefroy, and reporting on her interactions with him, writing in her second letter the 'day is come on which I am to flirt my last with Tom Lefroy', and adding: 'My tears flow as I write, at the melancholy idea'. However, all mention of Lefroy is buried amongst other observations, including ones about the weather, and other academics maintain that theories that the couple were more than friends would be pure speculation. As an old man, Lefroy reportedly answered 'with a boyish love' when asked if he had ever been in love with the author, although some have suggested that this was an attempt to play up his association to the woman who was by then a celebrated author. In 2009 a biography of the author claimed that Austen's true love was a clergyman named Dr Samuel Blackall, who met Austen in 1798. According to Dr Andrew Norman, Dr Blackall wrote  letters to friends revealing his wish to court the writer, but his uncertainty was treated as a snub by Austen.","George III framed sofa thought to have belonged to Thomas Lefroy .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Closed circuit television footage has been disclosed which may cast doubt on the alibi Amanda Knox has used to protest her innocence over the murder of Meredith Kercher. Security camera footage time-stamped 20:53, November 1, 2007 - the night of the murder - shows a woman resembling Knox walking through a car park in Perugia, near the house she shared with British student Ms Kercher. The woman’s jeans and long coat are similar to those Knox was pictured in in the days following the murder and it has been suggested by the Italian TV progamme that aired the footage that the two walk in a similar fashion. Scroll down for video . New evidence: CCTV footage, left, shows a woman resembling Amanda Knox, right, walking through a car park at the time Knox said she was at her boyfriend's house . The footage was shown on investigative programme Quarto Grado, which explained that Ms Kercher appears on the video two minutes before the woman resembling Knox does, walking towards her house, according to The Times. Knox said in court that she had spent the night of the murder with her Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, reading a Harry Potter book and having sex. However the footage - if it was proven to be Knox - would raise serious questions over the validity of that alibi, which remains central to Knox's defence. It is unclear why the footage has never been used in court and why it has only emerged now. The television programme did not disclose how it had obtained the footage. Comparison: The Italian TV show that first aired the footage suggested that the woman in the grainy CCTV video has a similar walk to Amanda Knox . By raising questions over her alibi, the footage could be problematic for Knox. However the footage would also raise questions over the prosecution, firstly over why it has only emerged now, and secondly as to why Knox was leaving the house she and Miss Kercher shared before the crime was recorded as taking place. Knox remains convicted of the murder and a third trial - which in Italian law will finally decide on her guilt or innocence - is under way. However she refused to return from America, despite Miss Kercher's family calling for her to do so. Latza Nadeau, the author of Angel Face, . which was inspired by the case, said the footage is not helpful to the . prosecution or the defence. She told The Times: ‘If the prosecution shows someone like Amanda Knox walking away from the crime scene it's not helpful. For the defence, if there is a video of her anywhere near the house it's not helpful to them because her alibi is that she was at Raffaele's house.’ Miss Kercher enrolled at the city’s Universita per Stranieri (Foreigners’ University) in 2007 and found a houseshare with Knox and two others. She was found dead in her bedroom there shortly after midday on November 2, 2007. She had been sexually assaulted and her throat slashed. Knox and Sollecito swiftly became prime suspects along with Rudy Hermann Guede, a drifter and small-time drug-dealer originally from the Ivory Coast who was on the fringe of their social circle. Knox and Sollecito were convicted in a joint trial in 2009 but were acquitted on appeal in 2011; Guede is serving 16 years after a separate fast-track hearing a year earlier. In March 2013 Italy’s highest criminal court overturned the acquittals of Knox and Sollecito and the third trial began in Florence in September. New beginning: After she was freed in 2011, Knox immediately returned to her hometown of Seattle to rebuild her life . Shocking: Meredith Kercher was found dead in her bedroom in Perugia shortly after midday on November 2, 2007 with her throat slashed . Knox declared her innocence in an email submitted to the appeal court in Florence by her lawyers before their closing arguments in which she said: 'I didn't kill Meredith.' On January 30 this year the pair were found guilty of the murder of Miss Kercher. The court in Florence has now published the reasons behind Knox and Sollecito’s reconviction. A 337-page report stated that Knox stabbed Kercher to death in a fight over money. According to the report, known as a 'motivation' of the sentence, Knox inflicted the fatal knife wound to Miss Kercher. The document stated: 'It is a matter of fact that at a certain point in the evening events accelerated; the English girl was attacked by Amanda Marie Knox, by Raffaele Sollecito, who was backing up his girlfriend, and by Rudy Hermann Guede, and constrained within her own room.' It added that it is difficult to establish a reason for the brutal murder of Miss Kercher, but goes on to cite allegations of tension between Knox and the student. It also refers to a statement that Guede made to police that Ms Kercher believed Knox stole 300 euros (£246) - and two credits cards - from her, which is described as a ‘valid motive’ for the murder. After she was freed in 2011, Knox immediately returned to her hometown of Seattle to rebuild her life. She has found love with old friend James Terrano and is now a creative writing student. Last year she released a prison memoir for which she was paid a reported £2.6million.","Footage shows a woman resembling Knox in a car park in Perugia .

"By . Ben Spencer . They don’t fit with the ‘tall, dark and handsome’ ideal supposedly favoured by women. But there is some good news for shorter men – as when it comes to longevity, they just might measure up best. A study of 8,000 men has found that those of a lesser height lived longer than their taller peers – with those below 5ft 2in living longest. They don't fit with the 'tall, dark and handsome' ideal supposedly favoured by women. But there is some good news for shorter men - as when it comes to longevity, they just might measure up best . The research, conducted by US scientists, suggested short stature may be related to a gene that is linked to longevity. A protective form of the gene, called FOXO3, leads to smaller body size during early development but is also likely to mean a longer life span. Shorter men were also more likely to have lower blood insulin levels, and were less likely to have cancer in their lifetime. Professor Bradley Willcox, of the University of Hawaii, said: ‘ 'We split people into two groups - those that were 5-foot-2 and shorter, and 5-4 and taller. 'The folks that were 5-2 and shorter lived the longest. The range was seen all the way across from being 5-foot tall to 6-foot tall. The taller you got, the shorter you lived.' The study, published in the journal Plos One, tracked more than 8,000 American men of Japanese ancestry born between the years 1900 and 1919. The lifestyles and health conditions of these men were closely followed and studied by the researchers through the years. Shorter men were also more likely to have lower blood insulin levels, and were less likely to have cancer in their lifetime, the study found . Professor Willicox said the findings are not absolute, but do provide a strong link between height and longevity. 'No matter how tall you are, you can still live a healthy lifestyle,' he said. But he added: 'This study shows for the first time that body size is linked to the FOXO3 gene. 'We knew that in animal models of aging. We did not know that in humans. We have the same or a slightly different version in mice, roundworms, flies, even yeast has a version of this gene, and it's important in longevity across all these species.' Around 1,200 men from the study lived into their 90s and 100s, and approximately 250 of those men are still alive today. A separate study, published in 2012, had similar results. That research, which tracked men on the Italian island of Sardinia, found that shorter men lived for two years longer than their taller counterparts. It tracked 500 males born between 1866 and 1915. Smaller mice, rats, ponies and monkeys generally live longer. The smaller Asian elephant also lives longer than the larger African elephant.","Study of 8,000 men shows short men lived longer than their taller peers .

"By . Joel Christie . A Seattle man who was recently released from prison for offering to pay an undercover police officer for sex with a 13-year-old girl has been caught by the same detective for a near-identical crime. Thomas Rutledge Spencer - who also goes by the name Howard Kivley - finished a three and a half year sentence for attempted child molestation earlier this year. Now King County prosecutors claim the 65-year-old placed an advertisement online expressing his desire for a 'daddy-daughter' sexual arrangement with a young girl, according to Seattle P-I. Spencer is alleged to have sent several graphic emails to an undercover detective in which he offered to pay $50 for sex with a 15-year-old girl. Re-offender: Thomas Rutledge Spencer, 65, was allegedly caught trying to pay to have sex with a child straight after serving a three and a half year prison sentence for the same crime . In October 2010 he was caught responding to an ad posted by the same detective, who was posing as a parent attempting to pimp out a 13-year-old child. Two hours after the detective posted the ad, Spencer was in contact offering to pay for sex with the child. He sent hundreds of emails to the detective graphically describing what he hoped to do to the child. Spencer was arrested after meeting with the detective. He failed two polygraph tests when asked whether he’d molested children.

"By . Joel Christie . A school psychologist is facing federal charges after allegedly being intercepted by Homeland Security and traded child pornography online from a remote town on the Canadian border. Federal prosecutors contend William Brook downloaded hundreds of child rape photos and videos at his home in Point Roberts, a small Whatcom County community located on a peninsula with no land access to the United States. Officials say Brook was working as a psychologist for the Delta School District, which overlooks 24 elementary and seven secondary schools and is based in British Colombia. Homeland Security agents received a tip in mid-April that Brook had been buying child pornography online, according to Seattle P.I. 'I just want to erase the stuff': Delta School District psychologist William Brook allegedly tried to delete some data after being caught with 334 images child pornography images and some videos . Point Roberts is considered a part of the United States and Washington state, but can only be accessed through Canada. Agents stopped Brook’s car last Wednesday as he attempted to return to Point Roberts from Canada and seized his school district-issued computer. While no child pornography was found during the stop, the Homeland Security agent said Brook 'acted extremely nervous'. Brook is alleged to have admitted to exchanging photos of 'kids' on chat websites as in the interview progressed. 'I asked Brook if the photos were of nude children and Brook replied ‘'some of them’',' the agent said in court papers. Brook told investigators the photos were on his home computer, the agent continued, prompting a search Brook’s Benson Road home. Arriving at the duplex, Brook invited agents in and said 'I just want to erase the stuff', according to court papers. Isolated: Brook lives in Point Roberts, a tiny town of about 1,300 people that is part of Washington state but not connected to the U.S. and only accessed through Canada . Agents allowed Brook to open an online profile he’d created in which he declared his 'love' for 'pre-teen/pubescent boys and young teens' no older than 14, the Homeland Security agent told the court, according to Seattle P.I. Agents claim to have seen that Brook had downloaded child pornography the day before and seized his computer. According to charging papers, investigators found 334 files believed to be child pornography on the laptop, as well as a 4 gigabyte thumb drive filled with additional videos. The images and videos pictured the rape of very young children. Charged Thursday with possession of child pornography, Brook is expected to appear before a judge at U.S. District Court in Seattle on Monday. He remains jailed without bond pending that hearing.","William Brook is a school psychologist for the Delta School District, which encompasses 24 elementary and seven secondary schools .

"By . Louise Boyle . A 17-year-old boy accused of plotting a Columbine-style massacre at his high school denied the charges during a court appearance this morning. John LaDue's declaration to the judge on Monday morning in Waseca, Minnesota is the equivalent of pleading not guilty. He has been charged as a juvenile with . four counts of attempted murder, two counts of first-degree damage to . property and six counts of possession of a bomb. Prosecutors want to charge LaDue as an adult and have until July to make their case. Scroll down for video . John LaDue, accused in a Columbine-style plot to kill fellow students at his high school in Waseca, Washington, is led into court today for a hearing where he denied the charges against him . John LaDue was allegedly planning to kill his family before embarking on a massacre at Waseca High School that involved the same home-made bombs used in the Boston Marathon attack . Dressed in an orange jumpsuit and shackled at the feet and waist, LaDue stared at his father in the gallery when he was led in by police officers. The honors student answered Judge Gerald Wolf’s questions in a calm voice, according to the Star Tribune. If charged as an adult, he could face up to 18 years in prison. However if he is charged as a juvenile, LaDue could be free to leave a detention center when he is 21. The judge ordered him to stay at a juvenile detention facility until his next hearing on June 18. LaDue was arrested on April 29 . after a concerned citizen saw him enter a southern Minnesota storage unit. LaDue reportedly admitted . his intricate plans after being arrested, with police seizing an SKS . assault rifle with 400 rounds of ammunition, a 9mm handgun with ammo and . a gun safe with five more firearms, all in his bedroom at the family . home. Also in the room were three completed . pressure cooker bombs - the same type of explosive used in the Boston . Marathon attack - while another three - along with chemicals and . materials to make more - found in the storage facility the teen had . secretly rented. LaDue also had 60 pounds of metal ball bearings that would have been placed with the bombs as shrapnel, police said. The 17-year-old allegedly planned . to kill his parents and older sister with a .22-caliber rifle, then go . to the countryside and start a fire to distract police and . firefighters. LaDue was allegedly making explosives in a storage unit at this facility in Waseca, Minn., but his plans to use the devices were thwarted when a nearby resident, Chelsie Schellhas, noticed him entering the unit on April 29 and called police . Some of the bombs were allegedly found at this playground as snow melted around Hartley Elementary School playground in Waseca, Minn, in March. John LaDue, 17, has been arrested for plotting to kill his family and massacre students . He then allegedly planned to go . to his school, Waseca Junior/Senior High School, at lunchtime, set off . explosions in the cafeteria, shoot the school liaison officer and kill . 'as many students as he could'. The . plans were outlined in a 180-page diary, which contained one entry . dated July 2013, giving authorities an idea of how long LaDue had been . plotting the would-be massacre. LaDue anticipated he would be killed by a SWAT team, according to charging documents filed in Waseca County District Court. His father David LaDue earlier revealed that he feels responsible for his son's terrifying plan. Mr . LaDue said the main troubling change he noticed about his son in recent . months was his obscure questioning of a Bible verse, which he had . interpreted to mean that God was unjust or cruel. 'I . understand everyone wants to know and try to make sense of it, and it's . real easy if we could give it a simple answer like ''he's a maniac'' or ''his parents just bought him [stuff] and ignored him'','LaDue told The Minneapolis Star-Tribune. 'It would really be nice if it was that simple ... I wish it was that simple.' Caught: John LaDue was charged with four counts of attempted murder, six counts of explosives possessions and two counts of first-degree property damage . Mr LaDue also admitted his son, a deer hunter, was allowed to keep some guns in a safe in his bedroom closet, partly because he was trusted to watch out for the family when his father worked overnights in the Twin Cities. John also was allowed to practice throwing Tomahawk knives at an old pine tree in the front yard. David LaDue also gave his son the OK to walk to a friend's house after the town curfew once, a decision that led to a citation for the boy. 'I tried to indulge him in every way that I thought was harmless,' David LaDue said. 'I feel responsible for everything other than his fantasies or imaginations that I was unaware of.' David LaDue didn't regularly search his son's bedroom because he felt he had no reason. He had friends, a job at a grocery store, and never messed around with fights, drinking or drugs. The 17-year-old is close to his sister, who is just 15 months older, his father said. Police allegedly found an arsenal of seven guns, along with bombs and other materials, at this house where John LaDue lived with his family in Waseca. Father David LaDue was allowed to keep hunting guns in his room and throw tomahawks at the tree out front . 'We've never had what I felt was a concrete reason to really be concerned,' David LaDue said. Mr LaDue is not sure how his son obtained the storage unit or bomb materials, but said because of his job, he has his own debit card. Prosecutors say John used a PayPal account to buy things online. Mr LaDue said John was often the first home in the afternoon and would see the mail before anyone else. John LaDue had targeted April 20, the anniversary of the 1999 Columbine High School school massacre in Littleton, Colorado, as the date he planned to carry out the attack, authorities said. But that fell on Easter Sunday, postponing plans. Authorities believe he was going to act in the next few weeks. 'I believe there would have always been a reason for him to delay ... until he got caught,' Mr LaDue said. 'I don't know what the proper punishment is for what he's made it look like he was going to do. 'If he actually intended to carry out the things that he says he intended to carry out, I don't see how that's forgivable.' '(But) I can't believe that he actually intended to do it. I really can't. But I don't expect anyone to believe that.' John LaDue's capture has been credited to a watchful young woman who lives in an apartment complex next to the storage unit facility the student frequented. Chelsea Schellhas told The Star-Tribune she was doing dishes when she saw the teen was cutting through her backyard. 'He walked through the puddles when there was a perfectly good road he could have walked on,' Schellhas told the paper. 'It just didn’t seem right to me because we see people come and go with their trucks, and they don’t come on foot and cut through people’s back yards.' 'It was like he was blatantly trying not to be seen,' she continued. 'That’s why I thought it was odd.' LaDue took 'some time' before opening the door, appearing to be breaking in, Schellhas explained. Able to see into the locker, she noticed shopping bags and trash that 'didn't look right'. He then closed it behind him, cops said, and Schellhas called 911. Officers responding to the storage locker around 7.30 pm immediately noticed a significant amount of bombs and bomb making materials, police said. The bombs have since been detonated by an expert team.","John LaDue, 17, appeared in court on Monday in Waseca, Washington .

"By . Associated Press . Secret Service agent Thomas 'Lem' Johns, who was at the side of President Lyndon Johnson in the chaotic aftermath of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, has died at the age of 88. The former agent died of natural causes on Saturday at his home in Hoover, Alabama, his grandson Mike Johns said. Lem Johns served more than two decades in the Secret Service, including time as the special agent in charge of the president's detail during the Johnson administration. Thomas 'Lem' Johns, background right, stands behind President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife, Lady Bird, wearing a necklace, as they console Jacqueline Kennedy, right, on November 22, 1963 . Johns is pictured in iconic photos from Nov. 22, 1963 aboard the presidential plane where Johnson was sworn in during a hastily-arranged ceremony. One photo shows Johns standing behind former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy as Johnson consoles her following the oath of office. Johns was assigned to Johnson's security detail at the time of the shooting and was riding in the motorcade when the shots were fired. In a 2013 interview with WBRC-TV in Birmingham, Johns recalled hearing the shots from several cars back and seeing people duck during the chaos that ensued. He described to the station what it was like to arrive at the hospital where Kennedy had been taken.

Johns' family says a big part of his legacy was inspiring his son, Jeff, and grandson Mike to join the Secret Service. 'He had an honored career in the service,' Mike Johns said. 'He loved the Secret Service and loved his family and friends.' A Birmingham native, Lem Johns served in World War II with the U.S. Naval Air Corps. He attended the University of Alabama and later graduated from Howard College, which is now Samford University. After graduating, he joined the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in 1952, and he became a Secret Service agent two years later. He retired from the Secret Service in 1976 after spending several years in charge of its Birmingham field office.","Lem Johns served more than two decades in the Secret Service .

He received the Guinness World Record after Italian man Arturo Licata died before his 112th birthday, according to data collected by the Gerontology Research Group.

"By . Louise Cheer . People in Australia's eastern states can hold off unpacking their winter woolies - for now. While they'd usually brace themselves for the oncoming cold at this time of year, a jet stream - a strong, high-speed air current that can change temperatures - has created an unexpected turn in weather patterns. Current forecasts report that temperatures next week in South Australia, New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria will be up to six degrees higher than the May average. Record-breaking run: Sydney and Melbourne both have warm days ahead, with experts predicting a record-breaking run of above-average temperatures . Dominique Le Toullec soaks up the sun at Bondi Beach today. It is expected this glorious weather will last until Monday as the eastern states experience warmer temperatures than usual in May . Surfers took advantage of the warm autumn day at Sydney's Bilgola Beach today . Sydneysiders can expect to enjoy up to nine straight days of temperatures varying from 23 to 24 degrees, which are May conditions typical in Brisbane, according reports in The Age. Senior meteorologist at Weatherzone Brett Dutschke said if Sydney gets seven days of 23 degrees, it would set a late-season record. More... NASA data reveals Antarctic ice sheet is melting at an 'unstoppable' speed . Were dinosaurs wiped out by a 'nuclear winter'? Dust from the asteroid impact may have blocked the sun and caused temperatures to plummet . Sydney last had six consecutive days reaching such temperatures this late in autumn back in 1974. The mercury will hit 22 degrees in Melbourne on Thursday, with the long-term average temperature being 16.7 degrees in May. Melbourne residents may also experience up to 10 back-to-back days of 20 degrees or higher, according to the Bureau of Meteorology's forecasts. Mr Dutschke said the run, which began on Sunday, will beat the record of seven such days which was set in 1907. 'There are no strong signs of a strong cold outbreak in the next week at least for south-eastern Australia,' he said. In Adelaide, temperatures will peak at 24 degrees on Friday with its average being 19 degrees. In 2002, Adelaide had an eight-day run of temperatures above 22 degrees and Melbourne saw similar conditions. Melbourne's Footscray (pictured) also got a piece of the good weather action, with residents sharing sights on social media . Some people in Adelaide Hills wanted to share the sunshine and warmth being soaked up this morning with the internet . Chances of fog will also increase in Sydney over the next few mornings and it is likely to be widespread across the city on Wednesday Mr Dutschke. Bureau of Meteorology's Craig Burke added that a slow moving pressure system over the Tasman Sea caused this 'rare and significant' change. '(The system) will continue through the central coast and South Australia,' he said. 'We will certainly see warm conditions. 'With that particular weather system we’d expect to see clear sky and light to moderate winds.' Sydneysiders took advantage of the warmer than average temperatures today and shared pictures on social media of the Harbour city . The clear blue skies and warm weather seen in Hahndorf near Adelaide this morning is expected to continue for the next six days. But Mr Dutschke explained the warmer and clearer conditions comes down to the southward dip in the jet stream, which has held off the rain clouds for now. Mr Burke said Tasmania will not experience a run of clear days like other eastern states. Showers are predicted on Thursday and Saturday for the southernmost state.","Winter temperatures this year will be six degrees higher than May average .

Mr Hockey says the job losses, which are 4500 more than the coalition promised would be cut at the 2013 federal election, will make the bureaucracy more efficient and accountable. The job cuts are only 2000 more than the 14,500 bequeathed by the previous Labor government. Scroll down for video .

But the 2014/15 budget includes a one per cent cut in their base funding, described as a 'down payment' on an efficiency study completed earlier this year. Community and Public Sector Union national secretary Nadine Flood said the 16,500 figure doesn't include the 'many further job losses' that will flow from the government's program of privatisation and outsourcing. The ABC will lose $35.5 million in funding, a move the Community and Public Sector Union says 'will do enormous damage to our public broadcaster' 'Not one single job loss that will come from those [privatisation or outsourcing] efforts is counted in this budget,' Ms Flood said. 'We could see tens of thousands of jobs go over these next few years. ''Tony Abbott's Budget is a wrecking ball that smashes jobs and services... It's a myth you can cut this many jobs and not affect services.' Ms Flood was critical of the cuts to the ABC, SBS, ATO and the announcement that the CSIRO would lose $111.4 million over the next four years. 'Ripping $35.5 million out of the ABC, closing the Australia Network and cutting $8 million from SBS will do enormous damage to our public broadcasters,' she said. The Australian Tax Office will carry the largest staff reduction, with 4700 jobs to go in the next four years . 'Cutting 2300 tax workers is not going to help us collect the revenue Australia needs for essential services. 'Cutting 500 CSIRO staff will not help us come up with world-class innovations we need for globally competitive industries. 'And cutting civilian staff in Defence simply means taking soldiers out of the frontline and putting them behind desks.' Ms Flood also said the assertion the previous Labor government had bequeathed 14,500 job cuts was 'a myth'. 'Worst year of Labor cuts was 2,500 jobs. Now we're facing triple that number,' she said. Six-hundred public service jobs in the defence department are set to go in the next financial year. In total, more than 2000 positions will be lost by 2017/18 through natural attrition and changes to recruitment practices. The CPSU has labelled Mr Hockey's first federal budget a 'wrecking ball' But defence will get an extra $800 million to make $29.2 billion in 2014/15 and will benefit from almost $33 billion in 2017/18, the budget papers show. The public sector union had feared losses of more than 25,000, saying 6000 announced before the budget had already stretched government services to breaking point. The Budget outlined the government's plan to further shrink the number of assets owned by the federal, state and territory governments to achieve it. Private health fund Medibank has already been slated for a hoped-for $4 billion sale. The SBS will lose $8 million in funding . Among other assets the federal government said it was investigating selling were the Royal Australian Mint; the registry services of the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, plus Defence Housing Australia and Australian Hearing. 'The government is transforming its role to be smaller and as efficient and well-targeted as possible, with some changes informed by the National Commission of Audit's recommendations,' it said in the budget papers. States and territories would be encouraged to sell assets and develop infrastructure too. They would receive 15 per cent of the price of an asset sold if the sale proceeds go to new infrastructure investment.","Australian Tax Office will wear the most losses with 4700 jobs to go .

A Saturday tweet by the Contra Costa patrol division said that the dog - which is actually a female -  had been taken to Contra Costa County Animal Control in Martinez. CHP officer Alex Edmond told NBC Bay Area that he and his partner responded after police received two calls about the chihuahua. 'We attempted to coax it, we could tell it was very frightened, it was shaking - we were able to pet it a little bit, but other than that we could tell it was not happy,' Edmon told the station. Edmon told NBC Bay Area the dog did not respond to his offer of trail mix and was eventually taken by animal control. According to a CBS San Francisco report, she was eventually lured by a protein bar. The chihuahua, who has not been named, may already have found a new owner . Meanwhile, the chihuahua may have found a new owner. On Facebook, Contra Costa Animal Services wrote on Saturday that the dog was 'recovering [...] after her traumatic experience.' 'She may already have a home if her owner doesn't come for her!' the post said. The chihuahua also seemed to enjoy herself on Mother's Day, according to a Sunday Facebook announcement.

"By . Associated Press . During the first three months of this year, U.S. airlines canceled 4.6 per cent of their flights, the Department of Transportation announced today. The announcement means this winter was the worst for fliers in the last 20 years, according to the government data. Mother Nature is mostly to blame, with a relentless wave of snow and ice storms paralyzing airline traffic across the U.S. A view of airplanes on a tarmac during a snowstorm at the Washington International Dulles airport in Dulles, Virginia on March 3, 2014 . But airlines are also quicker to cancel flights these days, sometimes a day in advance of a storm. The shift in strategy came in response to new government regulations, improvements to overall operations and because canceling quickly reduces expenses. In May 2010, a new DOT rule took effect prohibiting airlines from keeping passengers on the tarmac for three hours or more. So, airlines now choose to cancel blocks of flights to avoid potential fines of up to $27,500 per passenger or $4.1 million for a typical plane holding 150 fliers. Making things worse for travelers, airlines have been cutting unprofitable flights and packing more passengers into planes. A worker de-ices an airplane sitting at a gate near terminal C at LaGuardia Airport in New York on February 3, 2014 . When flights get canceled there isn't anywhere to put the stranded passengers; some end up waiting days to secure a seat on another flight. In March, JetBlue had the highest cancellation rate among the bigger airlines - two per cent of flights. That was closely followed by the merged American Airlines and US Airways, canceling 1.9 per cent. Southwest Airlines and United Airlines both canceled 1.1 per cent and Delta Air Lines 0.2 per cent. Some of the highest flight cancellation numbers came from smaller regional airlines that are operated by other companies on behalf of the major airlines. ExpressJet, which flies regional planes for American, Delta and United, scrapped 5.1 per cent of its March flights. American Eagle canceled 4.1 per cent of its flights and SkyWest, another subcontractor, nixed 2.3 per cent of its scheduled flights. Flight cancellations are seen on an electronic flight board at LaGuardia Airport in New York, February 13, 2014 .","U.S airlines cancelled 4.6 per cent of their flights in the first three months of 2014 .

"By . Emily Crane . A father who chose to treat his daughter's cancer with 'alternative' therapies such as herbal tea and clay instead of chemotherapy has defended his decision at an inquest into her death. Tamar Stitt died in El Salvador in 2009 just three months after she was diagnosed with a rare form of liver cancer in Perth. Her parents, Trevor and Arely Stitt, are now facing an inquest after they ignored advice from doctors that their 10-year-old daughter needed seven weeks of chemotherapy to give her a 50-60 percent chance of survival. Tamar Stitt died in El Salvador in 2009 just three months after she was diagnosed with a rare form of liver cancer in Perth . 'I'm not going to accept it was wrong… we did what we thought was right at the time,' Mr Stitt told the inquest last week. 'We wanted what we believed was best for our daughter.' The inquest will examine whether the 10-year-old's death could have been prevented. Following their decision to decline chemotherapy in August 2009, Princess Margret Children's Hospital asked the West Australian Supreme Court to force Tamar to undergo treatment. Tamar and her mother fled to El Salvador on the same day the court was scheduled to hand down their decision after Dr Alastair Nuttall signed a medical certificate saying she was okay to fly, the West Australian reports. The 10-year-old was treated with herbal tea and red clay instead of chemotherapy . The Stitt's then began treating Tamar's cancer with herbal tea and red clay by wrapping her body in clay twice a day. 'The clay is basically the right medicine for any kind of illness,' Mrs Stitt told Channel Seven's Sunday Night from El Salvador in 2009. 'What it does, it dries up anything that is causing the illness in your system - all the toxics.' 'We never agreed for Tamar to have chemo. Because we've seen so many cases and knowing what we know about natural remedies, they work slowly but it's worth it.' The program aired the 2009 interview on Sunday after their reporter Rahni Sadler was called to give evidence as the inquest moves forward. Her parents, Trevor and Arely Stitt, chose not to let their daughter undergo chemotherapy because of the horrific side effects . Tamar eventually underwent chemotherapy when natural remedies proved unsuccessful, but she died in El Salvador two weeks after starting treatment. Mr Stitt told Perth Coroner's Court last week that he and his wife felt bullied by doctors when they declined chemotherapy for Tamar because of side effects, according to the ABC. More...

"By . Ted Thornhill . Just as UKIP are trying to shake off allegations of racism, the party has become embroiled in fresh controversy today after its youngest branch chairman was caught boasting about a ‘fantastic’ get-together where party-goers were smoking drugs. Rosie Ward, 17, posted photos on her Facebook page showing revellers drinking and smoking at a bar at an event she is thought to have hosted. The album was entitled ‘Punk Party’ and captioned: ‘The amount of baccy and weed I had to vacuum up. But all in all a fantastic night! X’. Controversy: Chairman of the UKIP Camborne, Redruth and Hayle branch Rosie Ward, 17, with her predecessor, Harry Blakeley . Miss Ward made UKIP history in March when members unanimously elected her as chairman for the Camborne, Redruth and Hayle branch in Cornwall. But despite being too young to be served in a pub, her photographs appear to have been taken inside The Hideaway Bar in Redruth, a venue which has since shut down. They show several young revellers clutching cans of beer, smoking outside and making two-fingered gestures at the camera. 'Punk party': Ms Ward posted this picture on Facebook of a party she attended at which she vacuumed up 'weed' and then said it was a 'fantastic night' Miss Ward has since responded by saying her father was present at the party and that the cannabis was brought in by gatecrashers. Cornwall Councillor Harry Blakeley, who Miss Ward took over from as UKIP branch chairman, said: ‘I’m aware that there is a situation regarding a Rosie Ward and a Facebook post. ‘Before considering Rosie for the role of chairman we strongly went through her history and she assured us that she had never smoked or taken any drugs.’ Straight A student Miss Ward is currently studying French, Latin and Spanish at A-level and plans to study Classics or History at university before joining the RAF. The outspoken youngster runs her own blog site entitled ‘Never Mind the B******s here’s Rosaleena’ where she espouses her anti-EU stance and lists her interests as sailing, record collecting, the violin and playing rugby. In one particular post Miss Ward attacks rules imposed on smokers saying they could drive young people to try more dangerous drugs. She writes: ‘The continued persecution of smokers with these laws has caused another, more pressing issue to rise - the use of marijuana. ‘The more rules imposed on smokers, the more young people passively turn against the authority and turn to more dangerous drugs, but the European Union still fail to address the true ‘war on drugs’ and yet totally reject the idea of legalizing them.’ A biog describing why Rosie joined Young Independence, the youth wing of UKIP, says she chose the party because it ‘encourages freedom of speech’. It also adds: ‘As well as this, Rosie happens to think Nigel Farage is awesome. ‘Cos he smokes. And she met Nigel once. He said she put her piece regarding grammar schools forward as ""beautifully put"".. twice.’ UKIP Cornwall’s chairman Steph McWilliam said he had spoken to Miss Ward and did not see the party photographs as a serious issue. He said: ‘I’ve spoken to Rosie and she’s assured us that her father was present at the party and the drugs were brought onto the premises by gatecrashers.’ Ward is the same age as Paris Brown, Paris Brown, the foul-mouthed youth crime commissioner who was forced to quit last year after a string of offensive Tweets. Defiant: UKIP leader Nigel Farage has spent the week defending his party . The controversy over Miss Ward’s Facebook page comes after days of embarrassing gaffes and slip-ups by UKIP.

"By . Damien Gayle . AT&T is in talks to swallow up DirectTV in a deal that could be worth close to $50billion, sources have revealed. The telecoms giant is said to be discussing an offer in the low- to mid-$90s per share for DirectTV, a satellite TV provider, which closed trading at $87.16 yesterday. A bid near $95 per share would value DirecTV at more than $48billion - a premium of more than 20 percent to its stock price before news of AT&T's interest first emerged on May 1. Predator: The AT&T logo on the facade of Whitacre Tower, the AT&T global headquarters building at One AT&T Plaza in Dallas, Texas. The firm is said to be in talks for a $50billion takeover of satellite TV firm DirectTV . The talks are the latest sign of a rising tide of potential megadeals in the telecoms, cable and satellite TV space, including Comcast's proposed $45billion takeover of Time Warner Cable. A tie-up between AT&T and DirectTV firm would create a pay TV behemoth close in size to a combined Comcast and Time Warner, which means the proposed merger could run into trouble with competition regulators. The consolidations come as television and other media industries face an uncertain future. Web-based TV and mobile internet are changing the way audiences consume products and slashing advertising revenue. AT&T, based in Dallas, Texas, is the second-largest provider of mobile communications and the largest provider of fixed telephone lines in the U.S. It is the the 20th-largest mobile telecom operator in the world, with over 250 million mobile customers. Its takeover target DirectTV broadcasts by satellite to nearly 20million U.S. customers and a nearly 10million across Latin America. A deal price has yet to be finalised and terms could still change, two sources told Reuters, adding that discussions are continuing. They asked not to be named because the matter is not public. Other details also have yet to be worked out, such as a break-up fee as well as a potential role for DirecTV Chief Executive Officer Mike White, the second person said. AT&T and DirecTV declined to comment. Bloomberg News earlier reported that AT&T was offering to pay around $100 per share for DirecTV, whose management team will continue to run the company as a unit of AT&T. On the up: DirectTV's share price has soared since news of AT&T's takeover bid first emerged on May 1 . The Wall Street Journal said a deal could happen in two weeks. DirecTV shares rose 6 per cent to $92.50 in extended trading on Monday. DirecTV is working with advisers including Goldman Sachs to evaluate a possible combination following a recent takeover approach from AT&T, Reuters reported last week. ReconAnalytics analyst Roger Entner said the time appeared to be right for an AT&T-DirectTV tie up, which could help both firms navigate the increasingly uncertain media landscape. 'This is not the first time that AT&T and DirecTV have danced around the fire and thought if they could give it a go,' he said. 'They both looked at each other for at least 10 years. Both kind of came to the conclusion that it was in the right environment. It makes a lot of sense to get together, but there was never the right regulatory environment for it.' A Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger would call for a counterweight like a combined AT&T-DirecTV, said Mr Entner. He added that the merger would make sense for DirecTV given the decline of satellite TV. 'They both see the Grim Reaper at the horizon. DirecTV hasn't gone out and bought spectrum. Dish has, so DirecTV needs to find a partner, and AT&T is that partner.' Some investors have also speculated about a potential tie-up of DirectTV and smaller rival Dish Network Corp. Dish Chairman Charlie Egan last week said his company, which attempted to buy DirecTV more than a decade ago, would not make a fresh approach at current prices even though he said such a tie-up would create many benefits.","Telecoms company said to be offering low- to mid-$90s per share in DirectTV .

"By . Taylor Auerbach . Leila McKinnon knows a good fight when she sees one. The Channel 9 presenter and wife of David Gyngell - one half of last week's epic Bondi Beach brawl with billionaire James Packer - has taken to Twitter to cheekily point out the similarities between her husband's dust up and the one captured on CCTV between Solange Knowles and brother-in-law Jay Z. And it seems McKinnon wishes her other half had the fashion sense of the American recording elite. Scroll down for video . Funny gal: The Channel 9 presenter's tweet was described as 'gold' on social media . 'Ok so they're much better dressed and a little more discreet but I feel a kinship with Beyonce, Solange, and Jay Z today,' she Tweeted this afternoon. Two paparazzi captured Gyngell and Packer, clad in clothes more befitting of bums than billionaires, punching and rumbling down Sir Thomas Mitchell Road last Sunday after the Channel 9 boss confronted his friend of 35 years outside the Packer mansion. On Monday morning (US time) TMZ posted a sensational video captured on security cameras inside an elevator of New York's Standard Hotel last week. Fight club: James Packer, left, and David Gyngell, right, were pictured brawling on the street in Sydney .

It shows Solange Knowles (sister of Beyonce) wildly attacking Jay Z after the Met Gala after party, requiring burly security guards to break up the fracas. Keen observes will note a number of striking similarities between the fight and the one which gripped Australia for days. The combined wealth of Jay Z and his superstar wife is reportedly approaching $1 billion (Aus). Solange Knowles is also not short of cash and was probably as close to Jay Z as Gyngell is to Packer, who's relationship may well have frosted over slightly after last week's events. Family feuds: Leila (left) feels like Beyonce Knowles after being caught in the middle of warring parties. Knowles (middle right) is pictured after the fallout between sister Solange and her husband Jay Z last week between the two opponents . McKinnon's light-hearted stab at her husband and his once best man was well received by her Twitter followers and has so far been retweeted more than 80 times. Today producer Marietta Del Vecchio joked on Twitter: 'clearly you're Beyonce right?!'. McKinnon, who retweeted the post, obviously agreed with the sentiment. There are even more overlaps in the 'kinship' McKinnon feels with the musical royalty aside from the fact that both sides boast brawling ultra-rich people. Last year it was reported that Beyonce Knowles was 'arguing' with her mother Tina because she was dating a Scientologist. James Packer's former links with the church, especially through mate Tom Cruise, are well-known. Leila McKinnon has been approached for comment.

Unlike the two men - who both bunkered down in the days following their jaw-dropping altercation - Jay Z and Solange Knowles have been spotted out and about in recent days.

"By . Wills Robinson . A mother-of-three who is believed to have been killed by her 'jealous husband' in a 'murder-suicide' suffered multiple stab wounds, while he was found with just a single knife injury, a post mortem has revealed. Hayley Stringer, 29, and her estranged husband David, 32, were discovered dead at a house in Walsall in the West Midlands, while their three daughters Chloe, 11, Chelsea, eight, and seven-year-old Lottie slept upstairs. West Midlands Police have now said they 'strongly believe' David killed his ex-wife before turning the knife on himself. Neighbours revealed the married couple . had split up just three weeks earlier and Mrs Stringer had recently started a . relationship with 19-year-old Matthew Read. Tragedy: Estranged couple, named locally as Hayley (left) and David Stringer (right), were found stabbed to death at their home in Walsall, West Midlands . The teenager was arrested in connection with the investigation but has since been released without charge. Last night the 19-year-old from Cannock in Staffordshire, who Mrs Stringer is thought to have met at work, declined to comment. He is understood to have told police that he came back to the property after a night shift and discovered the two dead bodies. Detective Inspector Justin Spanner, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Hayley suffered multiple stab injuries and David died from a single stab wound. Estranged: The couple, whose daughters aged 11, eight and seven were unhurt, had split earlier this year, and Mrs Stringer had started a relationship with a younger man, neighbours said . 'At this stage we strongly believe that this is a murder-suicide. 'While we are still to establish the . exact circumstances of what happened on Saturday morning, we are . currently not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.' Andrew Dutton, whose partner Lisa Ball is David’s cousin, said the pair had been together for about eight years but had recently had a 'fallout'. He added: 'We are just absolutely devastated, not just for David. Our prayers go out to Hayley’s family, David’s family and the kids. 'David was a lovely kid. He was very quiet, shy, hardworking and a devoted father. Matthew Read, 19, who is thought to have discovered the bodies of Hayley Stringer, 29 and her estranged husband David . 'It’s just so shocking. The family have been through so much stress lately. 'Apparently, in the last few weeks they have had a fallout and she’s gone with the 19-year-old.' One neighbour of Mrs Stringer has spoken of how she was woken early on Saturday by a woman’s screams. She added: ‘That must have been Hayley. It was awful – it’s been on my mind all the time since. Annette . Johnson, 60, said she too had been woken up by the sound of a woman's . screams shortly after midnight, and had then seen the flashing blue . lights of police cars at around 4am. Tributes: Bouquets of flowers were left outside the couple's home by shocked friends . 'I knew Hayley and the girls very well and would speak to them quite a lot,' she said. 'I didn't know David as well because he worked a lot but I would still say hello or wave to him. 'Hayley was lovely, she was always talking to people and had time for everyone. 'They moved here about three years ago, I don't know where they came from. They seemed to be a normal happy family.' Mrs Johnson said she had heard of the couple's split, but she had not spoken to Mrs Stringer about it. 'I saw that she was in a relationship with this young lad on Facebook too,' she said. Investigation: The floral tributes were left alongside the red-brick home as officers continued to search the property for clues as to how the couple met their death . 'I would see them walking together in the street but I don't know if he was living there. 'It is just so sad for the girls. The oldest one starts big school next year and she won't get a uniform bought from her mother. It's tragic.' Another neighbour said Mrs Stringer had ‘kicked out’ her husband only three weeks ago adding: ‘We’ve heard David came back.’ Although Mr Stringer, who worked for a metal importing and distribution company, was not the natural father of Chloe, neighbours said he raised her as his own. The father had changed his Facebook profile picture to a picture of his three ‘angels’ fewer than three weeks ago. On her Facebook page, Mrs Stringer - who worked for Spanish-owned engineering firm Gestamp Automocion in Cannock, Staffordshire - had listed herself as being in a new relationship with bespectacled Mr Read in April. Patrol: Police stand outside the property on Hollemeadow Avenue in Walsall . Murder scene: A man and woman have have been found dead with stab wounds, at a house in Walsall . Post mortem examinations of the bodies were due to be conducted yesterday, with the results expected to be released tomorrow. Mr Stringer, who was a darts fan, has a twin sister Zoe and a younger sister, Natalie, 31, who were both too upset to comment yesterday. Chloe’s father is Dean Gallagher from Burntwood, Staffordshire. He did not return messages last night. Police officers also recovered a weapon at the house. Detectives have been carrying out house to house enquiries and forensics officers are at the scene in a bid to try and establish what happened. Probe: A forensics officer at work outside the house where the two bodies were discovered .

"By . Lucy Crossley . A psychopathic sex criminal described as being 'very high risk to women' and subject to three restraining orders can appeal against wearing his tag after claiming it violates his human rights. Paul Richards, 47, has argued that when magistrates forbade him from stepping outside his home without the device they breached his right to a private and family life. Richards, from Middlesbrough, is now at the centre of a vital test case, after a judge ruled he may have cause for complaint, opening the way for him to argue his case before the Court of Appeal. Argument: Sex criminal Paul Richards, 47, is to appeal against wearing as tag as it violates his human rights . Diagnosed psychopath, Richards, who has . an antisocial and narcissistic personality disorder, has a long history . of offences of violence, kidnapping, dishonesty, harassment and no less . than 12 sex crimes. Reports have assessed him as 'a very high risk' to women and he is one of only a handful of sex offenders on the Ministry of Justice’s 'critical public protection' list on the basis that he represents an 'imminent risk of serious harm'. Drug user, Richards, who is currently in custody, having breached the terms of a sexual offences prevention order (SOPO), is already subject to three restraining orders made to protect adult women who had been harrassed or subjected to violence by him. Medical evidence indicated that he displayed high levels of deceit and manipulation and minimal emphathy or remorse for his crimes. Richards is subject to a SOPO which . forbids him from approaching, enticing or otherwise seeking to . communicate with any female he knows or suspects to be involved in . prostitution without reasonable cause. He was arrested for a suspected breach of that order in October 2012, after he was spotted in a red light district. That . was 11 days after magistrates ordered him not to leave his home without . wearing a tag, formally known as a Location Monitoring Device. Example: Richards is now at the centre of a vital test case, after a judge ruled he may have cause for complaint, opening the way for him to argue his case before the Court of Appeal . Richards says the indefinite requirement to wear a tag every time he leaves his home amounts to a violation of his right to respect for his home and privacy, enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. His complaints were rejected by the High Court last year. However, in a case which is bound to have a crucial impact on treatment of dangerous sex offenders in the community, he has now been granted permission to appeal. Describing the facts of the case as ‘very stark indeed’, Lord Justice Laws said it was arguable that the requirement to wear a tag indefinitely, and thus submit to ‘continuous surveillance’ by the police, went beyond the terms of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Richards was also granted leave to pursue his human rights arguments before a three-judge Appeal Court. His counsel, Hugh Southey QC, argued that indefinite tagging was ‘a very substantial interference with his right to personal autonomy’. He added: 'Richards had no choice as to whether to wear a monitor. The monitoring allowed the police to locate him at all times. 'That meant that there was potential to gain substantial data regarding his activities. That was a denial of privacy. 'It also meant he was unable to undertake lawful actions that he did not wish the police to be aware of.' No date was set for the full hearing of Richards’ appeal. Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights states that: . Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. Controversially, the article has previously been cited by foreign criminals fighting deportation at the completion of their prison sentences, claiming they have a right to family life in the UK. It is thought there are currently about 4,000 overseas convicts living in the UK that the Government wants to remove but is blocked from doing so by human rights laws. Somali rapist, Mustafa Abdullahi, 31, who held a knife to a pregnant woman’s throat as he assaulted her, is among the many criminals who cannot be deported from Britain because of rules on a right to family life. Abdullahi was jailed for ten years in 2007 after he threatened to kill his ‘vulnerable’ victim and repeatedly raped her in her own home. He was set to be deported on release and Home Office lawyers warned immigration judges of his dangerous nature and a continued lack of respect for the law. But in December last year he was deemed to have a right to a family life under Article 8 and released. Abdullahi does not have any children or a wife in Britain, but his mother and siblings live here.","Paul Richards, 47, argues wearing a tag breaches his human rights .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Young drivers aged 18 to 30 are most likely to wear inappropriate footwear such as flip-flops behind the wheel, a study has shown (file image) From flimsy flip-flops to towering stilettos, millions of drivers are risking their lives by wearing unsafe footwear behind the wheel. Some motorists even admit to driving barefoot, putting themselves and other road users in danger, new research suggests. Young drivers aged 18 to 30 are most likely to wear inappropriate footwear, with nearly one in three (29 per cent) confessing to donning high heels or sandals for a car journey. That compares to just one in six (15 per cent) of older drivers aged 50 to 65. Almost twice as many young motorists as older drivers wear inappropriate footwear while driving, according to a poll of 1,000 drivers by fuel giant Shell. Experts say drivers who do not wear flat shoes with a firm grip could find their feet slipping off the brake or clutch pedals of their cars, putting them at risk of having a crash. More than half (57 per cent) of young motorists believe they are better drivers than anyone else on the road. Yet, almost two thirds admit to driving with one or no hands on the wheel (59 per cent) and accelerating through amber lights (56 per cent), compared to a third of older drivers (34 per cent and 32 per cent). Almost twice as many young motorists also wear inappropriate footwear while driving. Furthermore, a third of young drivers (33 per cent) confessed to using their mobile behind the wheel, compared to just five per cent of their older counterparts. The research for Shell's smarter driving initiative found older motorists from the Midlands were kings of the road. The study found nearly one in three (29 per cent) of young people confessed to donning high heels or sandals for a car journey (library image) Drivers aged 50 to 65 from the Midlands are not only the safest but also the most fuel efficient. However, those aged 18 to 30 from Wales and the south west of England are the least safe or fuel efficient. The snapshot of the nation's driving habits ranked younger drivers aged 18 to 30 and older motorists aged 50 to 65 on their driving attitudes towards fuel efficiency and safety, including everything from smooth driving to wearing inappropriate footwear behind the wheel. Older drivers are more fuel efficient, making a conscious effort to drive smoothly (82 per cent compared to 57 per cent of young people), turn off the engine when idling (51 per cent compared to 37 per cent of young people), and remove excess weight from the boot (49 per cent compared to 36 per cent of young people). Drivers aged 50 to 65 from the Midlands are not only the safest but also the most fuel efficient, the survey found (file image) TV's Carol Vorderman, Shell's smarter driving ambassador, said: 'Today's challenge is about helping all British drivers understand just how easy it is to drive more fuel efficiently today.' Peter Rodger, chief examiner of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said: 'Modern engineering has done a great deal to make our cars more fuel efficient. But smarter driving is not just about engineering, it's also about the way you drive. 'Most people don't realise making a few simple changes, such as smooth braking, cornering and accelerating, can go a long way in increasing fuel efficiency and becoming a smarter driver.'","Motorists wearing flip-flops and stilettos are putting lives at risk .

"By . Sally Lee . She resolutely stood by her fiance even when he was convicted of the murder of his former girlfriend. But it seems that Rachelle Louise, the partner of killer Simon Gittany, has not had her fill of court appearances just yet. The 29-year-old model was seen attending the Lin family murder trial at Sydney's Supreme Court on Monday for the second time in a week, this time dropping the 'disguise' she wore on her first attendance. Scroll down for video . Spotted: Rachelle Louise, girlfriend of convicted killer Simon Gittany, leaves the Lin family murder trial on Monday at the Supreme Court in Sydney . She was first spotted wearing sunglasses and a purple hoodie arriving at the court last Thursday when Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie went on trial for murdering his brother-in-law Min 'Norman' Lin, 45, Mr Lin's wife, Yun 'Lily' Li Lin, 44, and their sons Henry, 12, and Terry, 9, in their Sydney home in July 2009. Xie, 50, is also alleged to have killed Lily's 39-year-old sister, Yun Bin 'Irene' Yin. His defence counsel, Graham Turnbull SC, said Xie 'was physically incapable' of carrying out the murders. More... Brother-in-law ‘killed Lin family then planned to steal DNA from funeral home and plant it on hammer to cover his tracks’ The court heard that the victims were killed by blunt force trauma and asphyxiation as the murderer moved through the four bedrooms of their home in North Epping. Mr and Mrs Lin's teenage daughter was the only member of the family to survive. She had been overseas on a school trip when the murders took place. The model wore a purple hoodie at the start of the trial for accused killer Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie last Thursday . Miss Louise's connection to the Lins is unclear but the case is one of the most notorious crimes in recent years. She was last in court earlier this year to support Gittany, during his high profile murder trial for throwing his former former fiancee Lisa Harnum to her death from the balcony of the Sydney apartment they shared. Her unwavering believe that he was innocent, coupled with her striking similarity to Miss Harnum, made her a central figure in the trial. She took to the stand to declare her love for 'romantic' and 'caring' Gittany, declaring the killer is 'the best boyfriend I have ever had'. Lookalike: Ms Louise, who's with her boyfriend Simon Gittany, closely resembles murdered ballerina Lisa Harnum . When he was found guilty in the New South Wales Supreme Court, she screamed at the judge, burst into tears and had to be taken from the court. Outside, standing amid a crowd of press photographers and television cameras, Louise smoked a cigarette and continued weeping. Louise was also spotted visiting her lover at Sydney's Parklea Maximum Security jail less than a week after Simon Gittany was sentenced to a maximum of 26 years behind bars. Bludgeoned to death with a hammer: Min 'Norman' Lin, 45, Mr Lin's wife, Yun 'Lily' Li Lin, 44, and their sons Henry, 12, and Terry, 9, were killed in their Epping home. Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie, pictured outside court on Friday, is accused of murdering five members of his wife's family in their Sydney home in July 2009 . The night before on national television Louise had declared that she would only wait five years for him. During Ms Louise's second paid interview for a reported $150,000, which aired on Channel Seven, she bizarrely re-enacted for the cameras how she believed it would not have been possible for Gittany to throw Ms Harnum over the railing. She also dismissed an eyewitness account as 'rubbish' of Ms Harnum's fall from the balcony of the luxury apartment she shared with Gittany.

"By . Sara Smyth . At 25, Jenny Dawson seemed to have it all, with a lucrative job as a hedge fund trader, exotic holidays and plenty of trips to extravagant restaurants. But then the maths graduate decided it was time to stir things up. Inspired by her mother’s recipes and memories of her idyllic rural childhood, she swapped the fast-paced world of boardrooms and mega-bucks deals for a simple market stall selling chutneys and preserves made from leftover fruit and vegetables donated by the food industry. Jenny Dawson gave up her lucrative job in the city to start eco-friendly business Rubies in the Rubble. She now makes 1,000 jars of £5 chutney, which is stocked in Waitrose and Fortnum & Mason, per week . Miss Dawson, now 28, sells her chutneys - which are all made from fruit and vegetables that have been thrown away by restaurants and supermarkets - on a stall in London's Borough Market . Three years on, the gamble has paid off after she won the ‘Oscars’ of the business world for her eco-friendly company – which now has an annual turnover of £100,000 and supplies Waitrose and Fortnum & Mason. Yesterday, a thrilled Miss Dawson put her success down to a love of chutney she inherited from her mother Liz – who helped to get her business off the ground by giving her much-needed advice on recipes. ‘My mum was on the other end of the phone talking me through things at the very beginning,’ she said. ‘I made some pretty vile batches – it was a matter of trial and error.’ The maths graduate, pictured winning the New Generation prize at the Veuve Clicquot Business Woman Awards, tributes her success to her mother's recipes . Recalling her childhood in rural Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, she said: ‘Our water came from a well, our fruit and vegetables from our garden and we had a wind turbine installed.’ But after graduating from Edinburgh University with a Master’s in maths and economics, Miss Dawson ended up working in a very different environment – a hedge fund in Central London. She never forgot her passion for all things natural, however. So, to the surprise of her family, she decided to ditch her lucrative career to ‘pick through the rubbish bins’ of the food industry. After collecting the surplus fruit and vegetables from markets or local farmers, she began boiling batches at home and selling them at a stall in London’s Borough Market. Miss Dawson, now 28, said: ‘I went from being able to do exactly what I wanted – going on lovely holidays, having extravagant meals out – to living on a shoestring. I’ve only been able to start paying myself a wage three months ago, so it’s been a long wait. But I wasn’t passionate about finance and if I’d stayed in it for the money I’d have been really upset with myself.’ The entrepreneur, whose father is a beef farmer and whose mother is a ceramic artist, now produces 1,000 jars of chutney a week and hopes to exceed last year’s £100,000 turnover. Her preserves come in six flavours, including apple and ginger, and cost less than £5 per jar. Last night she was awarded the Veuve Clicquot New Generation Award for her innovative company, Rubies in the Rubble. ‘I’m absolutely thrilled,’ she said. ‘When I had a change of heart and told [my family] “I want to make jam from leftover produce” there were a few surprised faces, but they understood the ethos behind my idea. But the most important thing they taught me was about believing in myself and not to be afraid of failure.’ The businesswoman, pictured on her London stall, says her passion for all things natural comes from her rural upbringing in Dumfries, Scotland, where the family's water came from a well and fruit and vegetables from their garden .","Jenny Dawson gave up her job as a hedge fund trader aged 25 .

"By . Tara Brady . Paedophile broadcaster Stuart Hall will not give evidence from the witness box in defence of sex assault allegations . Paedophile broadcaster Stuart Hall will not give evidence from the witness box in defence of sex assault allegations, a jury has been told. Hall, 84, has pleaded not guilty at Preston Crown Court to 20 allegations of rape and indecent assault between 1976 and 1981 against two young girls. The complainants came forward after he was jailed last year for a string of historical indecent assaults against 13 young girls. Following the end of the prosecution case, Crispin Aylett QC, defending Hall, said: 'I am not intending to call the defendant to give evidence.' It is said the former It’s A Knockout presenter groomed his victims and plied them with alcohol before he raped them. One of the complainants, Girl B, said Hall raped her when she was aged 12 at a stables and went on to rape her at various locations, including at two BBC studios, when she was 14 and 15. The other alleged victim, Girl A, said she was raped on numerous occasions at the same Manchester studios at Piccadilly and Oxford Road when she was aged between 14 and 16. Hall said the alleged rape at the stables did not take place, while other sexual contact was consensual. He has admitted to indecently assaulting Girl B when she was aged 13. Earlier, the jury heard that Hall told police he was 'surprised' when confronted with fresh sexual assault allegations made by two women. He added it was 'of serious concern' that they had 'waited nearly 12 months' to make their claims, which he denied. The first complainant, Girl A, contacted a firm of solicitors on June 5 last year - a month after it entered the public domain that Hall had pleaded guilty to 14 offences involving 13 young girls. Two days later she contacted police and went on to make a witness statement on August 7 last year.Girl B was asked by police in December 2012 - when Hall was initially arrested in the first investigation - whether she would make a witness statement in relation to a complainant but she said she did not want to become involved. Last October, Hall was brought from prison and interviewed about the new allegations . Girl B made her first contact with the police over her own allegations on July 12 last year, the jury was told. She gave video recorded interviews in the days that followed. Last October, Hall was brought from prison and interviewed about the new allegations. After he was formally cautioned, Hall’s solicitor read out a statement on his behalf in which the defendant said he had accepted legal advice not to answer any questions put to him regarding the accusations. In his statement, Hall said he had known both complainants for a number of years. He went on: “I am surprised by the nature of their allegations and I deny them. 'I am concerned that they have been made only after I pleaded guilty to a number of offences and then was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. 'It is only now at the end of October that I am being interviewed about these allegations. 'In relation to (Girl B), (Girl B) spoke to the police in December 2012 before I was charged with the offence in relation to (victim from first court case) and at that time declined to assist the police. 'Thereafter (Girl B) offered her support to me.' Hall, 84, has pleaded not guilty at Preston Crown Court to 20 allegations of rape and indecent assault between 1976 and 1981 against two young girls . He added that it should be noted that Girl A had approached a firm of personal injury solicitors before going to the police. Hall continued: 'I am now approaching my 84th birthday and my health understandably continues to deteriorate. 'It is of serious concern that these two complainants have waited nearly 12 months after I was arrested (December 2012) to make their allegation and in the light of extensive media coverage I do not think it possible to have a fair trial.' Hall was jailed last year for 15 months after he admitted indecently assaulting 13 girls, aged from nine to 17 . He was subsequently charged and made no comment. Hall was jailed last year for 15 months after he admitted indecently assaulting 13 girls, aged from nine to 17. The sentence was increased to 30 months by the Court of Appeal after the Attorney General argued it was 'unduly lenient'. A psychologist, instructed by the defence, said it was possible that Girl B’s memory of being raped in the stables was 'confabulated' in that the event did not happen. The jury heard that therapy or dreams could produce false memories. Dr Ian Anderson said: 'The person who has the memory has a honest belief that it is true.' He said a confabulated memory could not be disentangled from a genuine one without 'external reference'. He explained that might be done with a photograph, a video recording or if a number of witnesses said an event did not occur. Girl B told a therapist that she had a 'recurring dream' about the alleged rape but said it was a memory of an incident that she knew had happened. Dr Anderson agreed with Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, that it was also possible that the recurring dream was “a product” of the trauma of being raped at the age of 12. Next the jury heard a statement from Jean Tetlow, a production secretary, who worked at the BBC in Manchester with Hall during the relevant period. She said she had never known him to drink alcohol before broadcasting or other professional commitments. She added she had never seen anything inappropriate in his dressing rooms at Piccadilly or Oxford Road. Ms Tetlow said she did not recall seeing Girl A at the BBC studios. She did remember being introduced to Girl B at Oxford Road but stated 'there was nothing in her demeanour or attitude to indicate there was anything untoward happening with her and Stuart'. Ms Tetlow said she would have raised the matter with Hall or a senior colleague if she had. She added she always found Hall 'respectful' in her company and again would have made any concerns about him known to bosses if she had any. The trial continues tomorrow.

"By . Emily Crane . The body of a Perth man is believed to have been located in Nepalese mountains after he was reported missing six months ago. Matt Allpress, 23, had been on a solo 10-day hiking trek in Nepal’s Annapurna region and missed his flight home on November 14 last year. Human remains were located on Saturday by two local Nepalese people foraging in the mountains above Sikles, about one hour off the main track. Scroll down for video . Human remains found in the Nepalese mountains are suspected of being that of a 23-year-old Perth man Matt Allpress . Police located several personal items belonging to Mr Allpress including his ATM card, 120 Nepalese rupees, a jacket, pocket diary and iPhone. ''The investigation has been intensified further after the family members and friends identified his personal items which were found there on Saturday,' acting chief district officer Arjun Sharma told the The Himalayan Times. Mr Allpress' mother Margaret is currently in Nepal but said she was waiting for authorities to return from the search area in Sikles to find out more. His father is on his way to Nepal from Western Australia. Mr Allpress was reported missing six months ago after failing to return from a solo 10-day hiking trek in Nepal's Annapurna region . The search has been focused on Nepal's Annapurna region where Mr Allpress was trekking . The Allpress family last heard from their son on November 3 when he sent a message from a guesthouse in Sikles saying he would be 'out of contact for 9-11 days, heading to a place called Dudh Pokhari, then I'm back in time for my flight into Sydney on November 14.' Mr Allpress was listed as a missing person on November 17 after his family raised the alarm when he didn't arrive in Sydney and failed to alert anyone that he had missed his flight.

Erica Packer spent Mother's Day with former husband James Packer's family, just days after she attended the funeral of billionaire Paul Ramsay with him, fuelling rumours of a possible reunion between the pair. The 36-year-old former model had lunch on Sunday with James' mother Roslyn, sister Gretel, niece Francesca, and her own daughter Emmanuelle, one, at the swanky Otto Ristorante on Woolloomooloo Wharf in Sydney. The family lunch comes days after Erica was seen arm-in-arm with James, who was fined $500 for publicly brawling outside his Bondi home with Channel Nine CEO David Gyngell.Scroll down for video . Family love: Erica Packer chose to spend Mother's Day with James' mother Roslyn, his sister Gretel and their niece Francesca Packer, the family enjoyed lunch at Otto Ristorante in Wooloomooloo, Sydney on Sunday . The couple separated in September last year after six years of marriage and Erica currently resides in Los Angeles with the couple's three children –Indigo, five, Jackson, four, and Emmanuelle, one. It is rumoured that Erica received a divorce settlement of more than $100 million last year. Despite the separation, Erica told Vogue Australia last year that she is still close to her in-laws: 'Gretel and Ros are amazing women. I really admire and appreciate my in-laws. They are strong, they are there for me, and we are all in regular contact. We are – and remain – a family.' She flew into Sydney last Thursday with the couple's youngest child, to attend the funeral of healthcare magnate Paul Ramsey on Friday, with James. The 36-year-old, pictured here embracing Ros Packer, has spent the past few days with James and his family, after attending the funeral of Paul Ramsay with James on Friday . Erica and James Packer announced their separation in September last year and since then Erica has been livingin Los Angeles with the couple's three children, including one-year-old Emmanuelle (pictured) The family lunch comes just days after Erica attended a funeral with her  James, which was the first time the couple have been pictured together since their separation . The couple attended the funeral together, flying to Bowral on a private helicopter and sitting next to one another in the St Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church in Bowral where the service was held. It is the first time the couple have been pictured together since their split, and the reunion comes at troubled time for the casino mogul who was photographed brawling his long-time friend on May 4. It is believed the fight followed a heated text message exchange between the men concerning Mr Packer's fears that a camera crew from the network run by Mr Gyngell was trying to catch him with model Miranda Kerr, whom he is rumoured to be dating. Mr Gyngell had gone to the $20million property in Sydney's Bondi Beach to reassure casino owner he was not under surveillance by Nine Network television cameras. James Packer did not attend the family celebration, which occurred exactly one week after he was photographed brawling with his mate, Channel Nine CEO David Gyngell . The Packer women spent the day shopping and enjoying lunch at the upmarket Otto Ristorante restaurant . Three generations: The model embraced her niece, Francesca, the daughter of James's sister Gretel (left) On Friday, the pair were given criminal infringement notices for offensive behaviour, a penalty which carries a fine of $500 if it goes uncontested by the recipient. The case stalled earlier in the week due to the fact neither Mr Packer nor Mr Gyngell lodged an official complaint over the incident, though Mr Gyngell took responsibility for the fight in a statement. '[Mr Gyngell] fully accepts that he was the instigator of the incident. He respects the job police do and will co-operate fully with their investigation,' it said. At the funeral on Friday, Mr Packer's left eye was still visibly puffy and bruised from the fight. In an interview with Vogue last year Erica revealed that she was still close with the Packer family, particularly her mother-in-law Ros and sister-in-law Gretel .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A pub has opened in Greater Manchester offering pints of beer for as little as £1.50 - but insists that it does not encourage irresponsible drinking. The Pound Pub in Atherton, near Wigan, is the second location in a chain of new public houses offering no-frills booze at extremely low prices. And - despite protests from some locals who prefer a pricier pint - the publican has insisted 'we don't encourage people to get drunk'. Barmaid Natalie Hammond pulls a pint at the Pound Pub in Atherton, Greater Manchester (left). These four varieties cost just £1.50 for a pint (right) Dave Sutton, 31, even says that the new budget drinking model could offer salvation for the British pub at a time when around 18 locals a week are closing across the country. His pub has been open for around two weeks, and follows the first Pound Pub in Stockon-on-Tees which opened last month. Four types of booze - Fosters, Theakstons, Strongbow and John Smith's - are on offer there at £1 for half a pint or £1.50 for a whole. The pub also offers bottles of Becks beer and fruit drink J2O for £1, and pints of Pepsi and R-Whites lemonade for the same price. The location has an EasyJet-style logo and has the motto 'more round for your pound'. No-frills drinking: The Pound Pub, formerly the Old Isaacs, offers four drinks at £1.50 a pint . Daytime: Drinking at the Pound Pub begins at 9am, which has prompted concerns from locals . Mr Sutton says the opening has riled other pub owners because it dominates daytime drinking in the area, but says he has seen 'no trouble'. He said: 'At the end of the day, if you can only drink ten pints at £3, you are still only going to be able to drink that if they’re £1.50. 'We don’t encourage people to get drunk and there’s been no more trouble. In fact the pub is already going very well and the customers seem to be happy. 'The other pubs in the town are not so happy but that’s not our fault. That’s just because throughout the day we have the majority of customers in the town in here. 'Pubs around the country are shutting all the time so something has to be done - and this could be it.' Mr Sutton said his clients are mainly old men drinking throughout the day, starting as early as 9am. Happy drinker: Keith Emmott, pictured, has been drinking at the establishment since before its transformation, and approves of the change . He said the the pub was only met with one objection when its application for an extension to its alcohol licence was put forward last year. One daytime drinker said: 'People were expecting the street to be full of drunks but it’s not because even though the beer is cheap it’s still just passing trade. 'If people get out of hand they get kicked out - it’s like any other pub, only cheaper.' Retired restaurant and factory worker Keith Emmott, 63, has been frequenting the pub in its various guises since 1963, when he says a pint was just 11 pence. He added: . 'It’s always been a good pub and it still is, especially now it’s . cheaper. They have a good landlord now who’s very caring because when I . fall asleep he always wakes me up and that goes a long way.' However, . some residents of Atherton have criticsed the Pound Pub for taking . advantage of 'vulnerable' drinkers and lowering the tone of the town. Basic: The pub saves money by not offering entertainment or subscribing to Sky Sports . Busy: The pub's landlord says that trade has been strong since the pub opened . Salesman Adam Parkinson, 49, drinks in the nearby Last Orders Inn, for £3 a pint. He said: 'We don’t want the £1 pub around here. There are already enough pound shops and they’re rubbish too. All this bar is doing is selling cheap alcohol early in the morning to vulnerable people. 'It’s £3 a pint in here and I pay the extra because it’s civilised and not full of vulnerable people.' Rival pub landlady Mary Bates, 44, who runs the nearby Jolly Nailor pub said she welcomed the pub for keeping 'bad people' out of her establishment. She said: 'At least it keeps all the riff raff in one place. We are happy because it takes all the bad people out. Every town should have a pound pub because it attracts all the ne’er-do-wells. 'It used to be a cracking pub but it’s been going down and down.' The local council has also raised fears that the pub will encourage 'irresponsible' problem drinking and threaten public health. Wigan Council’s director of public health, Professor Kate Ardern, said: 'Alcohol used to be a luxury, but it is now widely available and often sold at pocket money prices. Research has proved that the cheaper alcohol is, the more people drink. 'Any promotion which potentially increases the supply of cheap alcohol and which appears to target those on limited incomes, especially young adults, who are cost-conscious, is highly irresponsible - particularly in a borough like Wigan which has high rates of alcohol harm.' Hike: The average price of a pint of beer is £3.03, a five per cent increase since 2012 . The average price for a pint of beer in . the UK is £3.20, but it varies depending on where you are in the . country. According to the Good Pub Guide, the average prices of a pint . in different places are: . London: £3.60 . Scotland: £3.24 . Wales: £3.15 . Manchester: £3.00 . Leeds: £2.40 . Surrey: £3.52 . Newcastle: £3.05 . Northern Ireland: £3.30 . Other venues . Coach and Horses in Soho, Central London: £5.80 . Wetherspoons, Birmingham: £3.30 .","Location has opened in Atherton, Greater Manchester, with pints for £1.50 .

"By . Tara Brady . One of Britain’s most crooked company bosses has been jailed for nearly five years for masterminding a £6m scam to fund a lavish lifestyle. Demitris Bains, 51, and his gang set up dozens of bogus companies in which they bought goods on credit, then re-sold them without paying the suppliers. Bains would then collapse the firms when creditors began demanding their money back, often leaving them bankrupt. Southwark Crown Court heard the ¿long firm¿ fraud went on to spark one of the biggest ever investigations . His sister Kiran Dillon, 45, used a series of aliases to hide her identity as she secured more funds for the gang’s other fake companies, even targeting the very same traders who had just been scammed. The group, who traded as construction companies based in the East Midlands, splurged creditors’ cash on bottles of vintage wine, champagne and the latest hi-tech gadgets. Bains used cash from the scam to pay for helicopter lessons and build himself an indoor swimming pool. Southwark Crown Court heard the ‘long firm’ fraud went on to spark one of the biggest ever probes by the Department of Trade and Industry. Bains was jailed for four years and nine months while Dillon was given four years and three months after they admitted fraud charges. Prosecutor Gerard Pounder said that Bains was also able to build houses without spending a single penny and employ labour free of cost as a result of the fraud. ‘Some of the fraudulent companies that were set up never made any purchases at all’, Mr Pounder said. ‘Irrelevant goods were ordered, for example alcohol, and top of the range mobile phones from Vodafone. ‘It was a cynical scheme to steal goods from small trading creditors.’ Bains was also able to build houses without spending a single penny and employ labour free of cost as a result of the fraud . Prosecutor Gerard Pounder . The court heard the gang’s bogus companies included Milli-Style Limited, Britannia (Construction Supplies) Ltd, Fabricat (Nottingham) Ltd, Sharpe Developments Ltd, Woodpro Limited, All Aspects Construction Ltd, Blue Chip Innovations Ltd, RMD Imports Ltd and Real Estate Midland Ltd. Mr Pounder added that Real Estate Midland alone racked up debts of over £1m before it was wound up when creditors demanded their money back. More firms were shut down by Bains when they were chased up by suspicious suppliers attempting to recoup their losses, before administrators wrote off the debts. The court heard that the scam, which took place between 1998 and 2005, reached its peak in 2004 when RMD Imports crashed with debts of over £500,000. Sentencing, Judge Jeffrey Pegden QC said: ‘You have all been involved in a very significant long term fraud in the Midlands, which was run by you Demitris Bains and your sister Kiran Dillon. ‘You used a number of companies as vehicles for fraudulent trading. ‘Those companies pretended to be legitimate and they persuaded trade suppliers to grant trade facilities in order to obtain goods and material on account. ‘Many, many creditors were left completely unpaid and were often smaller trade creditors, in some cases becoming bankrupt. ‘A serious aggravating feature in this case is that many of the already defrauded trade suppliers were re-targeted by the next company in line’. Bains was jailed for four years and nine months, while his sister Dillon was jailed for four years and three months. Both were also disqualified from acting as a company director for 12 years. Simon Ludgate, 47, who fraudulently named his wife as the company director of Real Estate Midland because he had been declared bankrupt, was jailed for three years and three months. Calvin Harris, 51, was also jailed for three years and three months and disqualified from acting as a company director for ten years. Eric Harris, 71, was caged for two years and six months. Sukhi Samrai, 47, was handed a 21-month prison sentence suspended for 18 months, while Philip Williams, 54, was given a two-year sentence suspended for two years and ordered to pay £2,500 in compensation. Bains, of South Parade, Nottingham, admitted conspiracy to defraud. Dillon, of Fen Lane in Balderton, Newark, admitted nine counts of fraudulent trading. Ludgate, of Exefold, Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottingham, and Calvin Harris, of no fixed address, both admitted fraudulent trading and acting as a company director while disqualified. Samrai, of Pocklingtons Walk, Leicester; Williams, of Huthwaite Road in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottingham; and Eric Harris, of Apollo Drive, Hempshill Vale, Nottingham, all denied a single count of fraudulent trading and were found guilty at trial.","Demitris Bains, 51, and his gang set up dozens of bogus companies .

"By . Lucy Osborne . A fire that killed three generations of one family including a nine-week-old baby was last night said to have been caused by a faulty phone charger. Boys Adyan Parwaiz Kayani, nine, Amaan Parwaiz Kayani, seven, and their nine-week-old sister Minahil died with grandmother Shabina Begum, 53, in the blaze at the family home in Sheffield a fortnight ago. Mrs Begum escaped the fire but died after going back in to try to save her trapped family. Her daughter, Anum Parwaiz, 20, who was the children’s aunt, also died in the blaze. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Amaan Nazim, 7 (right) and Adhyan Nazim, 9 (left) died in the fire thought to have been started by a faulty charger . Siblings: The three . children who died in the blaze a fortnight ago - (left to right) the nine-week-old girl Minahil, Adhyan Nazim, nine, and his brother Amaan, seven . Tragedy: The burnt-out Sheffield house where three children, including a baby, and two women died in April, which started in the living room at night . Although detectives are not yet . certain of the cause, they said yesterday it was probably a faulty . charger used for phones and tablets. It is believed the device was in the living room of the terraced house. The . tragedy highlights growing concerns about cheap, dangerous chargers . bought over the internet that overheat and cause fires or injuries. Most . problems occur at night – the most convenient time to recharge tablets . and smartphones. But constant charging for hours can heat badly-made . devices to dangerous levels. Tearful: Aunt of the children, Nazia Parwaiz Kayani, cried last week as she paid tribute to three generations of her family who perished . Moving: Hundreds gathered last week for the funerals of the children and adults killed in the devastating Sheffield fire a fortnight ago . Bereft: Amaan and Adhyan with their father Nazim Parwaiz, who was at work during the blaze and his wife escaped . Bereft: Cousin Ishfaq Hussain Kayani said today 'in a matter of minutes the whole family has been destroyed' The . children’s mother, Razia Nazim, was asleep but able to escape the blaze . just after midnight on April 28. She was comforted by friends and . neighbours as she cried: ‘I want to see my children.’ Her husband, Nazim Parwaiz, screamed as he was held back from trying to reach the dying youngsters. He . had been out working as a taxi driver but rushed home to see the . emergency services desperately trying to restart the children’s hearts . using cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Neighbour . Quasim Saddique, 20, said: ‘I heard screaming and glass shattering, and . when I got down to the house, the fire brigade was already there. ‘I . saw them carrying the kids in their arms out from the house and giving . them CPR.’ A funeral for the family on Thursday was attended by more . than 2,000. Ishfaq Hussain Kayani, the cousin of one of the women who died, yesterday paid an emotional tribute to the family. He . said: ‘It’s a huge tragedy, five members of one family dying like this. A 54-year-old mother, her daughter, a 20-year-old student and three . adoring grandchildren have lost their lives. ‘Just . in a matter of minutes the whole family has been destroyed.  You can . imagine what the children’s parents are going through. I don’t have the . words to describe how the family is feeling, other than shell-shocked, . devastated. ‘The . grandmother came out of the house and made several attempts to go and . rescue the three children along with her daughter. She gave her life . trying to rescue her grandchildren. ‘She . was a wonderful lady – very generous, kind and an excellent wife and . caring mother. She was just the perfect person.’ A spokesman for South . Yorkshire Police said the full inquest into the deaths of the two women . and three children could reveal more details. He . added: ‘Following a joint investigation, South Yorkshire Police and . South Yorkshire  Fire and Rescue have found  that the most probable . cause  of the fatal house fire in  Nether Edge, Sheffield, was an . electrical fault involving a  faulty charging device.’ Several deaths have been linked to faulty chargers, leading experts to warn against buying cheap counterfeits. An investigation in October by the Trading Standards Institute found dangerous chargers and adaptors that fail European safety standards are being sold on the internet for just £5. Of 21 chargers and adaptors it tested – all bought from UK sellers – 15 were unsafe, and seven were deemed so unsafe they posed a risk of electrocution. While it is not known whether a counterfeit product caused the fire that killed the five members of the Parwaiz-Kayani family, such products have been blamed for other incidents. Last year, Chinese air stewardess Ma Ailun, 23, was electrocuted when she answered her iPhone while it was charging. Connor O’Keefe, seven, died in 2007 while playing with his Gameboy. Connor, from South East London was using an unsafe charger his family had bought on holiday in Thailand.","Sheffield fire a fortnight ago started in the living room of terraced house .

"By . Inderdeep Bains . Her beloved car survived without a scratch when an out-of-control lorry demolished two vehicles near hers. But that was where Janice Dunlop’s good fortune came to an end. After offering two shaken survivors of the crash shelter in her car, she could only watch in dismay as firemen took the roof off so that the pair could be treated. Wrecked: Janice Dunlop's avoided getting caught up in the chaos after an out-of-control lorry demolished two vehicles near hers only for firemen to later remove its roof . Paramedics decided the drastic action was necessary after the elderly woman and her son both developed neck pains. Yesterday Mrs Dunlop, 38, a mother of two, was counting the cost of her good deed but said: ‘Although it is inconvenient and has put us in a difficult position financially, I would do it again.’ She and her friend had watched in horror as a skip lorry lost control on a bend and slid down a hill on its side, crushing two cars in its path before halting in front of her silver Vauxhall Vectra. Quick-thinking Mrs Dunlop  managed to avoid being hit after reversing away from the destruction as it unfolded on the A27 near  Arundel, West Sussex, on Sunday morning. Chaos: The lorry demolished this car when it went out of control. No one was badly hurt in the accident . No regrets: Mrs Dunlop said: 'Although it is inconvenient and has put us in a difficult position financially, I would do it again.' In the chaos that followed, she allowed the 46-year-old driver of a Toyota RAV4 and his 73-year-old mother to sit in her car after theirs was wrecked. Mrs Dunlop, from Littlehampton, said: ‘They looked very distressed and were clearly in shock, they were clutching at their chests. I felt awful for them.’ Once in the vehicle, the pair began experiencing neck pains, which left paramedics and firemen in a difficult position. Mrs Dunlop, who had been taken to a fire engine to keep warm, said: ‘I was told that the roof of my car would need to come off. Horror: Mrs Dunlop had watched as a skip lorry (pictured) lost control on a bend and slid down a hill on its side . ‘I was in shock, especially after surviving the crash untouched, and I was dreading telling my husband Steve. I couldn’t watch. I know it is just a lump of metal, but I relied on that car and I loved it. ‘It was the only car we have in the household and we can’t afford to replace it.’ Mr Dunlop, a mechanic, said: ‘I’m just glad that she is OK.’ They are waiting to see if the loss  of their X-reg car will be covered  by insurance. A spokesman for South East Coast Ambulance Service said: ‘It is never ideal to take the roof off a perfectly good car and we thank the car owner for their assistance.’ No one was badly hurt in the accident.","Janice Dunlop's car survived when an out-of-control lorry demolished two vehicles near hers .

The west coast of Scotland saw some of the worst of today's storms, with residents in St Andrews, Fife taking a series of amazing photos of dark skies and flashes of lightning. After capturing a picture of a bolt of lightning striking earth, amateur photographer Kerry Johnstone said: 'It had been really sunny and was actually pretty warm when it just got really dark and rain clouds started coming in. I've always wanted to capture lightning and I was so surprised that I actually got it.' Heavy showers and downpours affected nearly all parts of the country today. Early-season cricket was affected, with the match between Essex and Sri Lanka in Chelmsford one of a number in which play had to be stopped.

"By . Paul Donnelley . The smell of sun cream, bubble gum and fish and chips have been revealed among a list of 40 scents which trigger nostalgic childhood memories of school days, holidays and loved ones. The study of 2,000 adults also found freshly mown grass, candy floss and rain on hot tarmac set the senses harking back to years gone by. Experts found a waft of lavender, peppermint and were most likely to spark memories of their grandmother, while the smell of petrol, musty sheds and Old Spice were likely to prompt memories of grandfather. The smell of sun cream, bubble gum and fish and chips have been revealed among a list of 40 scents which trigger nostalgic childhood memories of school days, holidays and loved ones . The research, commissioned by Disneyland Paris to mark the launch of its new attraction Ratatouille - The Adventure on 10 July, also found more than half of Brits said the aromas of holiday destinations trigger lasting memories. Additionally the results showed eight in ten of those polled said a whiff of a certain aroma instantly transports them back to a specific memory – more than 70 per cent said those memories were happy ones. Professor Barry Smith, a sensory expert who worked with Disneyland Paris said: ‘More than any other sense, smell can evoke powerful, emotional memories. Whole scenes of people, places and things can be brought back to life by the mere hint of a long forgotten scent. ‘The rooms in a friend’s house, a boat trip, the sound of a voice, can all be conjured up by smell's power to reproduce the scenes for us. ‘The top 40 scents show a wide array of things that awaken our senses and stay with us for the rest of our lives. Bubble gum can evoke childhood memories of sweet shops . ‘They show the pleasure we take in experiencing smells and the powerful emotions they evoke. ‘Happy memories from childhood are bound up with particular smells, and it is the sense of smell that will preserve our link to them. ‘Whether it's a seaside holiday, a visit to a fairground or a sunny walk through a forest, suddenly smelling a particular scent can suddenly take us right back there, re-creating the whole sensory experience.’ The influence of childhood memories on us as adults was clear with six in ten saying our early memories affect us powerfully as adults. Results also showed the smell of chalk, pencil shavings and marker pens puts us right back in the classroom, while the smell of fresh leather has us harking back to slipping our feet into a brand new pair of school shoes. While the alluring scent of Chanel perfume or a particular hairspray sparks visions of mother or grandmother getting ready to go out. Bonfire smoke, a mug of hot Bovril and the smell of a smoky log fire wrap us back in our cold winter nights growing up. Certain smells really do stick – the over 55s were just as likely to associate the scent of candyfloss with fun childhood attractions as were the under 25s. The power of the senses remains strong despite age – over 55s were just as able to recall memories as the 18-24s. Those in Northern Ireland are most likely to be receptive to a smell reminding them of specific people or places. 1. Freshly mown grass (summer days/school sports day)2.

People in Yorkshire were most likely to feel that the memories and experiences of their early life influences who they are now. Parents in the northwest place the biggest importance on ensuring their children have strong positive memories in their early years.

"By . Associated Press . One was the constant in Richmond women's basketball, the beloved assistant coach who had been on staff for 15 seasons, remaining through two coaching changes. The other was hardly out of college, always cheerful and willing to help. Associate head coach Ginny Doyle and director of basketball operations Natalie Lewis were killed on Friday in a fiery hot-air balloon crash along with the pilot, Daniel T. Kirk, who had 20 years of flying experience and was affectionately known as 'Captain Kirk'. The three were mourned on Sunday by friends, family and colleagues alike. Scroll down for videos . Laura Jordan wears a red ribbon with her hat decorated with initials of Natalie Lewis and Ginny Doyle before the University of Richmond's Commencement Ceremony in Richmond . 'There's not a person in this business . that doesn't see Ginny as just a light,' Joanne Boyle, now the coach at . Virginia, said of Doyle, who was on her staff with the Spiders from . 2002-05. 'She was just a light for other people, and when you talk about . this business and the genuineness and caring about the kids and what's . best for the student-athletes, she epitomized that.' Doyle, 44, was hired by Bob Foley at Richmond in 1999. When Boyle got her first head coaching job, replacing Foley at Richmond, Doyle 'just rose to the top' in an interview and Boyle decided to keep her on staff. She also tried to get Doyle to come along when she left for California, but with no luck. Instead, Doyle stayed on when Michael Shafer took over, and rose three years ago to associate head coach. Lewis, 24, was a four-year, letter-winner in swimming who just completed her second season with the basketball program. Her job required great organization skills as she made travel, hotel and bus arrangements for the team, planned for meals and handled day-to-day basketball business. In the grind of a season, broadcaster Matt Smith said, she was a shining light, too. 'Sometimes when you work in sports, coaches can be so high strung and so focused on the next game or what's going on that you feel almost uncomfortable when you go into the office, but her being the first one that you would see, she always had a smile on her face,' Smith said.

Doyle and Lewis were two of the three people aboard a hot air balloon that drifted into a power line, burst into flames and crashed on Friday .

'Getting ready to go up!': Natalie Lewis (left) and Ginny Doyle (right) pictured the morning before their deadly balloon flight in a foggy test run. The pilot pictured here was not the one who went up with them on Friday afternoon . Smith met Doyle as a junior in the . 1990-91 season, her first with the Spiders after transferring from . George Washington. She became a star and later figured in one of the . most revered moments in the program's history. As a senior, she set an . NCAA record - for men or women - by making 66 consecutive free throws, . an accomplishment that earned her dubious recognition from CBS college . basketball analyst Billy Packer. Packer, . an 81.9 per cent free-throw shooter at Wake Forest, scoffed at the . record on air and noted that women use a slightly smaller ball, which in . his mind made it less impressive. Hearing . that Packer was going to be in Richmond on another matter, the school . invited him to come shoot against Doyle, and about 1,200 fans watched . the duel at the Robins Center on February 2, 1992. Lift-off: This is the last image of Natalie Lewis, 24, (right) Ginny Doyle, 44, (center) and pilot Daniel T. Kirk (left) as they lift off on Friday. They died a short time later when the aircraft hit a power line and burst into flames . Fiery crash: This hot air balloon carrying at least three people caught fire mid-flight and went down in Virginia . Frantic: The pilot reportedly started taking the necessary security precautions like trying to open the top of the balloon because the fire would cause the balloon to travel higher faster . It . was no contest: Doyle, using a men's ball, made 20 of 20, with only two . of them touching the rim. Packer, to the delight of the crowd, missed . eight of his 20 attempts. Her . record has since been broken, but years later her foul shooting, as . well as her love of the game and her players, remained on display, . according to Robert Fish, a Richmond alum who also has called women's . games on radio. 'When I . would go to practice to do an interview with (Shafer), Ginny would be in . there playing one-on-one with somebody, or challenging somebody to a . free throw shooting contest,' Fish said. 'The kids loved her.' Kirk, the balloon pilot from Delaware, was known by fellow pilots as 'Captain Kirk,' the hammy commander of the USS Enterprise on the TV series Star Trek. Natalie Lewis, pictured in February, University of Richmond director of basketball operations, sits on the bench during a game against Virginia Commonwealth University in the Robins Center in Richmond . Steve . Hoffmann, who said he taught Kirk to fly and built the balloon he was . piloting, called him 'one of the nicest guys in the world' and a . consummate professional. 'He was not a hot dog, not a risk taker,' Hoffmann said. 'It's so unbelievable that everyone's in shock.' The . balloon was among 13 that lifted off Friday on a preview night for the . Mid-Atlantic Balloon Festival when it drifted into a power line, burst . into flames and fell into a heavily wooded area about 25 miles north of . Richmond. On the ground, 'it was complete silence,' spectator Nancy Johnson said. 'There were people praying. It was horrible.' State . police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said another pilot interviewed by . investigators described how the pilot tried to open vents to release . extra-hot air in an attempt to keep the balloon from rising faster. 'Based on witness accounts, he did everything he could to try to save the passengers' lives,' Geller said. The remains of the third victim were found Sunday.

"Oscar Pistorius took acting lessons before standing trial for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, a South African journalist has claimed in an open letter to the so-called 'Blade Runner'. British-born columnist Jani Allan says Pistorius had been tutored by one of her 'close friends' before taking the stand in Pretoria, continuing that the paralympian was a 'faux hero' who has 'betrayed people and disappointed his fans.' Allan's letter . reads: 'I have it from a reliable source that you are taking acting . lessons for your days in court. Your coach has an impossible task.' VIDEO: Scroll down for footage from the trial . Performance? South African journalist Jani Allan accused Oscar Pistorius of  taking acting lessons for his trial . Source: Allan claims Pistorius has been tutored by a close friend and says he is a 'faux hero' 'Oscar, I look at you mewling and puking in the witness stand. You truly represent everything that the West loathes about white South Africans who live extravagant lives in their expensive laagers.' Asked about her letter, she told The Sunday People: 'I have this information from extremely reliable sources.' She also compares Pistorius to Eugene Terre'Blanche, who served three years in prison for assaulting a petrol station attendant and for the attempted murder of a black security guard around 1996. She said of him: 'Terre’blanche was cut from the same cloth as you, Oscar. 'He was given to boasting, vain in all things, narcissistic in the extreme and flying into terrible rages when things didn’t go his way. I suspect this description fits you.' The Paralympic superstar has frequently wept and been sick during the more difficult moments of his trial. Reeva's mother June Steenkamp has also accused the South African of acting out, referring to moments he has wept uncontrollable while sitting in the dock. In the early stages of his trial Dr Denise Bjerkman analysed his body language. Curious: The claims came just weeks after Reeva's mother accused the paralympian of acting . She said: 'Oscar has to project a complex image of innocence and grief to the mass media and court. 'His squeaky clean image . comes natural to him with his short hair, relaxed wide-eyed response in . social interaction and charming smile. 'What Oscar has to juggle in court is his . three public personas: the boyish wonder he stage-managed for the global . media – who will challenge any obstacle and which refutes his . disability; the humble, controlled, grieving Oscar for public . consumption in the courts and the suave flash Harry, fast cars, gung-ho . image of Oscar with adoring women draped on his arm. 'His dramatic, tearful breakdown in . court - when the brutal wounds on Reeva’s Steenkamp’s body were . discussed - is more likely to be conveniently staged. I believe such behaviour serves to hide his feelings of sickening guilt and vulnerability.' Pistorius admits shooting 29-year-old Reeva on Valentine's Day last year but denies premeditated murder and two counts related to shooting a gun. The trail continues on May 5. Acting? On many occasions throughout the trial he has been seen cowering in the dock with heads in his hand . Distracted: The paralympian has even been caught looking at his phone during court proceedings .

"By . Chris Pleasance . It may about to be turned into luxury apartments, but old plans uncovered in the shed of leisure entrepreneur John Broome reveal Battersea Power Station was once destined to become a Las Vegas-style indoor theme park. The sketches, which were found by Mr Broome while clearing out his house along with his son Will, show the atrium of the power station filled with white-knuckle rollercoasters, a giant ice rink, and six storeys of shops, cinemas and cultural experiences each themed around a different continent. Plans for The Battersea, as the attraction would have been called if it had opened in 1990 as planned, also include a giant ice rink, waterfall and an 'oceanarium' big enough to be explored by miniature submarines. Lost Vegas: These sketches show what the inside of Battersea Power Station would have looked like if plans to turn it into an indoor theme park had gone ahead. It would have included a huge ice rink, hot air balloon rides around the atrium and six floors of shopping, cinemas and cultural experiences, each themed around a continent . Under the sea: The sketches also contain plans for a giant 'oceanarium' which visitors could have explored using miniature submarines (pictured). Other attractions would have included a pleasure-park on the Thames, indoor rollercoasters, and a bullet train to Victoria station which would have carried visitors back and forth in three minutes . Beauty: The site would also have included a landscaped front entrance. However plans fell through after the cost of removing asbestos from the building spiralled, bringing the total estimated budget from £35million to more than £200million . Visitors would have been able to jump on a high-speed bullet train from Victoria which would have taken them to the complex in three minutes, then explored a pleasure-park by the Thames, browsed in an upmarket shopping mall, before finally jumping in a hot-air balloon for a ride around the enormous interior atrium. Mr Broome bought the site for just £1.5million, but his plans came unstuck when the cost of removing asbestos from the brickwork spiralled, bringing the total construction bill from an estimated £35million to £200million. Mr Broome was forced to sell off the station, and his company Battersea Leisure stopped trading. It is thought he lost tens of millions in the process. Iconic: The huge Battersea facility has been a feature of the London sky-line since it began operating in 1933, and has been given Grade II* listed status . Modern: New plans for the power station include luxury properties, a new tube station, a shopping mall, cinema complex, restaurants and outdoor gardens . Construction: While the estimated 250 new flats are built, the power station's iconic towers will have to be removed and then rebuilt because they are currently in danger of collapsing . Speaking to the London Evening Standard, Will Broome refuted allegations his father had 'vandalised' the structure after allowing the roof and some machinery to be removed, and said he should be thanked for laying the groundwork for the building's current renovation. Plans by the current owners, a consortium of businesses from Malaysia, include luxury apartments, a new tube station, a cinema and shopping mall. Home: Despite Mr Broome once being told Battersea would never become a residential development, new flats have gone on sale starting at £800,000 for a single-bed, £2.7million for a three-bedroom and £4million for a four-bed residence . Desirable: A total of 3,500 new homes will be right new to the new shopping mall and cinema complex, with the redevelopment expected to create 15,000 new jobs . 1926: The site of a super-station at Battersea is first mooted, with its proposed location causing a storm of protest. Plans are approved by Electricity Commissioners the following year. 1930: Battersea A, the first of the two adjacent power stations begins to take shape. Architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott is appointed and tasked with connecting Battersea Power Station’s architectural features. The steel frame is enveloped in a brick skin and the chimneys pre-cast in concrete. Distinctive fluting is designed for the brick cladding and chimney bases. 1933: The first two 69MW generating units in Battersea A begin operating. Two years later, a further 105MW generating set completes Battersea A. Design and presentation throughout the finished building reflects its eminent position in the industry. 1937: Construction begins on Battersea B. With war imminent, brick and concrete covers are constructed for the turbo– alternators and shelters built over existing glass. 1939: Construction of Battersea B continues throughout World War II. A survey by Architectural Magazine finds that the power station is the second most popular modern building in the country. 1944: Battersea B comes into service. Old: Plans for a power station at Battersea were first submitted in 1926, with the first power produced in 1933. While the four chimnies are now iconic, the station only had three until 1955 . 1953: With the last 100MW set commissioned the overall capacity is 509MW. Battersea generates a fifth of London’s power, with 28 stations taking care of the rest. It has a higher thermal efficiency than any other power station. 1955: The fourth and final chimney is completed, making the power station the largest brick building in Europe. 1975: Battersea A ceases generation after 42 years. 1976: Pink Floyd suspends an inflatable pink pig between The Power Station’s chimneys, for its ‘Animals’ album cover. Chaos ensues when the pig breaks free and flies into a Heathrow flight path. 1980: In recognition of its Art Deco splendour, the Secretary of State for the Environment Michael Heseltine lists Battersea Power Station as a building of special architectural and historical interest. 1982: Battersea B ceases operations. 1984: Battersea Leisure wins a development competition run by The Department of Environment and The Central Electricity Generating Board with plans for a leisure and entertainment complex. 1987: John Broome purchases the site. 1989: With initial demolition complete, including removal of the Boiler House roof and west wall, funding runs out and Battersea Leisure ceases trading. 1993: Hong Kong-based consortium Parkview International buys the site and embarks on a series of schemes and planning applications. 2006: Real Estate Opportunities (REO) plc, majority-owned by Irish developer Treasury Holdings, purchases the site and appoints Rafael Viñoly’s practice to devise a new master plan. 2010: The London Borough of Wandsworth grants planning for a development of 7.9m sq ft – one of the largest planning consents granted in central London. 2010: Following the collapse of the Irish real estate market, the Irish agency NAMA and Lloyds TSB foreclose on REO loans and administrators Ernst & Young (E&Y) are appointed. 2012: In June, it is announced that SP Setia and Sime Darby have entered into an exclusive agreement with Ernst & Young, NAMA and LloydsTSB to purchase Battersea Power Station. Wandsworth Council greets the announcement by stating that the deal is 'very good news.' In September the purchase is completed. 2013: Battersea Power Station launches its public sales.","John Broome purchased Battersea Power Station in 1987 with plans to turn it into a giant amusement park .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . A judge on Monday has ordered an investigation into the whereabouts of Casey Kasem after an attorney for the ailing radio personality's wife said the former Top 40 host had been removed from the country. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Daniel Murphy ordered a court investigator and adult protective services to find out where Kasem is being treated and report back to the court. Kasem, 82, suffers from advanced Parkinson's disease, can no longer speak and has been in various medical facilities chosen by his wife, Jean Kasem. Casey Kasem, 82, suffers from advanced Parkinson's disease, can no longer speak and has been in various medical facilities chosen by his wife, Jean Kasem . Casey Kasem's children have complained that they have been unable to see their father in accordance with an agreement with their stepmother. Daughter Kerri Kasem had sought a temporary conservator-ship and was appointed her father's temporary caretaker on Monday. Her attorney, Troy Martin, said the family believes the entertainer has been taken to an Indian reservation in Washington state. Murphy's order came after Craig Marcus, an attorney who appeared on Jean Kasem's behalf at Monday's hearing, said he did not know where the radio personality was but knew that he had been removed from the country. Daughter Kerri Kasem had sought a temporary conservator-ship and was appointed her father's temporary caretaker on Monday . ‘I have no idea where he is,’ Marcus said. The revelation brought stunned protests from Murphy and two of Casey Kasem's daughters, two of the entertainer's three children from a previous marriage. ‘Your statements concern me even more,’ the judge told Marcus, who declined to comment after the hearing. Marcus said in court that Jean Kasem had every right to move her husband as she saw fit. Murphy appointed a doctor to look into Casey Kasem's care and ordered a court-appointed attorney to find out his whereabouts as soon as possible. Casey Kasem gained fame with his radio music countdown shows, American Top 40 and Casey's Top 40, and was the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon Scooby Doo. Wife and husband: Casey and his wife Jean, shown in 2007 in Beverly Hills, California, have been married since 1980 . As temporary conservator, Kerri Kasem will have access to her father's medical records and other reports that have previously been sealed by court order. Kerri Kasem's case is the second one opened by one of the former host's children to try to gain access to their father and have some oversight over his care. A previous case by daughter Julie Kasem was dismissed after she reached a settlement with her stepmother, but the daughter said on Monday that agreement has been breached. In a court filing last week, Kerri Kasem's attorneys wrote that the entertainer has been repeatedly moved without warning and his children have been unable to see him. The complaint accused Jean Kasem of elder abuse by isolating her husband from his family. ‘We've been troubled for a long time,’ Kerri Kasem said after Monday's court hearing. She said Murphy's orders will ensure that the truth about her father's care comes out. ‘Justice has been served today,’ she said.","A judge has ordered an investigation into the whereabouts of Casey Kasem .

"By . Joshua Gardner . A group of Florida fishermen were astounded when they snagged a monster hammerhead shark last week but were even more shocked when they realized the injured beast was ready to give birth and they were going to have to be the doctors. Noe Campos and his friends had been wrestling with the massive catch for hours off the 700-foot Venice pier when it became tangled on a pole. Campos threw caution to the wind and jumped into the murky water only to realize the shark was seriously injured and its pups were actually trying to bite their way out of her and into the world.

Caught: The fishermen were fishing off Venice's 700-foot pier when the shark became snagged around a pole . Pregnant: The men found a big circular bite out of the shark's belly and sticking out was a hammerhead pup's tail . 'It had a big radius bite, a big bite mark taken out of it,' Campos told WFLA. Even more shocking: they could see a tail sticking out of the hole. 'They were trying to push their heads out, so i'm guessing the mom tried to give birth but she didn't have the strength to push them out,' said Campos. A shark expert told Chron.com that the hole in the shark's abdomen likely resulted from a bite from another shark that attacked her as she fought against the fisherman's line.

The group of fishermen pulled the pups out one at a time until they'd delivered twenty of the wriggling baby sharks that one of the men called 'very alert.' 'I stood in the water for a couple of seconds to make sure they swam off good. I held them and as soon as I put them out, voom! They took off,' remembers Campos. The mother hammerhead, an endangered species died. Attacked: One expert noted that the shark was likely bitten, not by her own pups, but by another shark as she fought against the line.

"By . Hugo Gye . Former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert was today sentenced to six years in prison for accepting bribes from housing developers. The verdict marks a drastic fall from grace for the former statesman, who was hoping to return to power at the next election. Olmert, 68, is the latest in a number of senior Israeli politicians who have been jailed in recent years, including a former president, cabinet minister and several lawmakers. The cases have shamed the country's political class - but also sparked pride in the strength of the courts, which have proved that no one is above the law. Jailed: Ehud Olmert, the former prime minister of Israel, has been sentenced to six years in prison . Fall from grace: Olmert was forced to resign in 2009 following persistent claims of corruption . In a court in Tel Aviv, Olmert was convicted of involvement in a multi-million-dollar real estate scandal while he was major of Jerusalem between 1993 and 2003. He was accused of taking bribes to promote a controversial housing development in Jerusalem that required a radical change in zoning laws and tax breaks for developers. Olmert asked the businessmen behind the Holyland project to pay $100,000 to his brother Yossi, who fled Israel because of financial problems. He also solicited funds for engineer Uri Sheetrit, who also had money difficulties and who subsequently backed the high-rise Holyland complex. Olmert became prime minister in 2006, after his mentor Ariel Sharon suffered a debilitating stroke, but was forced to resign in 2009 thanks to the persistent corruption allegations. Statesman: Olmert worked with figures such as George W. Bush in an attempt to end the Middle East conflict . Reputation: Olmert, pictured with Gordon Brown, was a hardline right-winger who became a centrist . During sentencing, judge David Rozen said: 'A public servant who accepts bribes is akin to a traitor. 'This is a man who was on top of the world. He served as prime minister, the most important position, and from there he reached the position of a man convicted of criminal offences.' Olmert is set to appeal against the guilty verdict and his jail sentence, but has been ordered to report to prison on September 1. His spokesman Amir Dan called it a 'sad day' in which an 'unjust verdict' was delivered against an innocent man, adding: 'It is a very serious sentence and we put our faith in the Supreme Court.' Assuming that Olmert does end up in jail, extra security arrangements will have to be put in place to accommodate his high-profile status. The politician was known as a hardline Right-winger, but began to take a more moderate line towards the Palestinians after he became deputy prime minister a decade ago. Olmert led the centrist Kadima Party to victory in parliamentary elections in 2006, on a platform of pushing further peace moves with the Palestinians. Corruption: Olmert pictured when he was mayor of Jerusalem, the time when the charges date back to . In office, he shocked many countrymen by warning that Israel could become like apartheid South Africa offering to give up control of parts of Jerusalem as part of a peace deal. Olmert led his government to the Annapolis peace conference in November 2007 - launching more than a year of ambitious, but unsuccessful peace talks with the Palestinians. Despite his ambitious agenda, Olmert's term was clouded by the kidnapping of an Israeli soldier who was captured by Gaza militants in a cross-border raid and an inconclusive war against Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon. But it was the corruption allegations which accompanied much of his political career that ultimately proved his undoing, as he was forced to resign to answer the charges against him. Olmert has already faced a trial on separate charges of accepting illicit funds from an American supporter and double-billing Jewish groups for trips abroad. In that case, he was cleared in 2012 of the most serious charges but convicted on a lesser count of breach of trust and given a suspended one-year sentence. He had signalled his intention to challenge prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he won his case on the real-estate charges.","Ehud Olmert, 68, solicited payments from developers for his brother and a city official while serving as mayor of Jerusalem .

"By . Jamie Carragher . When Liverpool’s players begin their lap of honour on Sunday, the chances are they will be left wondering what might have been. But they cannot lose sight of their achievements over the past 10 months. Liverpool have had an outstanding season and for long periods were the best team in the land. And who knows, if Manchester City suffer an unexpected slip, they could yet be crowned champions. The likelihood, however, is that there will be no trophy, as was the case in 2002 and 2009 when the club last mounted a challenge for the Premier League title. Those were the best Liverpool teams I played in but does anyone remember that? No. Why? We didn’t win anything. Blown it: Liverpool striker Luis Suarez hides his face after his side threw away a three-goal lead to draw 3-3 with Crystal Palace . On the up: Reds boss Brendan Rodgers has transformed Liverpool into title contenders this season . Shocked: Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard (second from right) and Simon Mignolet (second from left) applaud the travelling fans at Selhurst Park . Everyone remembers the team who won the Champions League in Istanbul nine years ago, but they were nowhere near as good as the side Brendan Rodgers has put together in this campaign, a side who have scored goals for fun and won 11 consecutive Premier League games. Do not underestimate how much of Liverpool’s improved form is down to Rodgers. Unlike the managers at Chelsea and Manchester City, he hasn’t been shopping at the top end, paying huge fees and huge wages; Rodgers’ success comes from endless hours coaching on the training ground. Look at the number of players who have improved: Jordan Henderson, Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge have come on so much, you would expect them to start when England face Italy at the World Cup, and Jon Flanagan could also get a seat on the plane if there are injuries this weekend. Even Steven Gerrard and Luis Suarez have benefited; Steven has excelled in a new, deep-lying midfield role, while Suarez’s form going up another level owes a lot to his tactically-aware manager. Liverpool have flourished thanks to Rodgers, not because Fenway Sports Group have emulated Sheik Mansour and Roman Abramovich. Brazil bound? Winger Raheem Sterling, pictured here scoring against Norwich, has flourished under Rodgers . On fire: Suarez is enjoying his best season in front of goal since moving to Anfield from Ajax . Guidance: Sterling has credited Rodgers' belief in him as a key reason behind his impressive form . In the two campaigns in which I came closest to the title, we needed two or three quality signings to make the next step, but the subsequent transfer windows were filled with poor signings as Gerard Houllier, Rafa Benitez and their scouts made mistakes that  prevented us from pushing on. Houllier, for instance, rejected the chance to sign Nicolas Anelka after a successful loan spell in 2002. Nicolas helped us get to 80 points but Houllier instead bought the Senegalese pair Salif Diao and El Hadji Diouf, as well as the France midfielder Bruno Cheyrou, for more than £20million. Diouf scored twice on his Anfield debut against Southampton but that was a rare highlight. After initial training sessions, you hoped nerves were holding them back, but within a few months it was clear they wouldn’t improve us. We ended up finishing fifth, with 64 points. It was a similar situation in 2009. Benitez sold Xabi Alonso and bought the injured Alberto Aquilani; Sami Hyypia left and was replaced by Sotirios Kyrgiakos; the situation was also aggravated as the signings that had been made in the summer of 2008 were not up to standard, either. People such as Philipp Degen, Andriy Voronin, Andrea Dossena and David N’Gog had rarely played as we fought it out with Manchester United but in 2009-10, when injuries and suspensions kicked in, they were found wanting when we needed them to step up. Back in 2009, Liverpool looked at bringing Michael Owen back to Anfield; Everton were interested, too, but Manchester United unexpectedly moved in and Michael told me about a revealing conversation he’d had with Sir Alex Ferguson. You might have thought Ferguson would have been worried about us bridging a four-point deficit, but he said to Michael he couldn’t see Liverpool having it in them to go again and that Chelsea were United’s biggest obstacle. He was right. Chelsea won the title, we finished seventh with 63 points. So now is where things become complicated for the modern Liverpool and many will wonder — me included — if they have it in them to go again should they miss out. It is essential the moves they make once the window opens are right. Flop: Alberto Aquilani failed to make the grade at Liverpool as a replacement for Xabi Alonso . Mistakes: Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher believes former manager Rafa Benitez made errors in the transfer market . Rejuvenated: Rodgers has helped Suarez (left) and Gerrard (right) hit top form this season . Look at last summer’s signings. The big money buys, Simon Mignolet and Mamadou Sakho, have done OK but need to improve, while the rest — Iago Aspas, Luis Alberto, Victor Moses and Aly Cissokho — failed to contribute. What difference would they have made if they had been a success? Moses and Cissokho, who came on loan, will go back to their parent clubs, but if Aspas and Alberto stay they will have to start making a difference, as Liverpool’s workload will be increased with the Champions League to factor in. Liverpool don’t need a summer where they buy players to fit in around the edges. They need quality additions. They need three players to go straight into the team — two defenders and a midfielder  — then another striker and a wide player to add depth and quality. Disappointment: Victor Moses (left) has struggled to make an impact since joining on loan from Chelsea . Pressure: Rodgers must spend his summer budget more wisely than he did last year . Room for improvement: Summer signing Mamadou Sakho (right) has enjoyed a mixed campaign . We hear a lot about the transfer committee who work behind the scenes at Anfield but however the system operates, the owners need to back Rodgers financially and trust his judgment to bring in the quality that will prevent a repeat of what happened after 2002 and 2009. Brendan, his scouting team and the owners need to learn the lessons from the mistakes that were made in the past and ensure this campaign is a springboard for future  success rather than the summit of ambitions. It took Houllier and Benitez four seasons to make a title challenge but Rodgers has done it in two, in a more entertaining style, albeit with the help of having no European football. Whatever happens this weekend, Liverpool now have to challenge for the title year in, year out.","Liverpool have had an outstanding season but may well end it without silverware .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Attacked: Rene Umberger wants her attacker charged with attempted murder . A female diver claims she was attacked Thursday while 50 feet underwater off the coast of Hawaii, and has the video to prove it. Rene Umberger, 53, of Kona, is calling for the man who ripped the air supply out of her mouth to be charged with attempted murder after an altercation that she says almost killed her. ‘This man needs to be arrested,’ she told Hawaii News Now. ‘I think this man needs to be arrested immediately for attempted murder.’ Umberger claims she encountered her attacker – who is named in a separate article, but MailOnline is withholding his name because he has yet to be charged – while documenting damage to coral reefs just off the coast. Video of the incident shows a diver quickly swim towards her and rip out her oxygen line. She eventually got it back in again, but then he came back for more. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . ‘I honestly thought he was coming back for a second attack,’ said Umberger. ‘I got up on the boat and I said oh my God, someone just tried to kill me underwater.’ The environmental activist says she has taken more than 10,000 dives in her life, and that experience is what kept her from dying. ‘An inexperienced diver would likely panic. Either panic from the stress of the situation and shoot for the surface, she explained. ‘They may panic because their air source is missing and they can't find it. Any of those things causes a diver to shoot for the surface and those incidents often lead to death.’ Terrifying: Umberger is approached by another diver while underwater . Suffocating: Her air supply was ripped out, leaving her unable to breath for almost half a minute . Umberger appears in the video to find her oxygen in under 30 seconds. Going to the surface too quickly causes divers to die of a condition called ‘the bends,’ which results from oxygen decompressing in the body and forming bubbles in different parts of the body. The oxygen bubbles can cause symptoms ranging from joint pain to paralysis and seizures caused by brain damage. ‘Never in a million years. Never in a million years did I think that someone would attack like that, especially from such a distance,’ Umberger lamented. ‘It's not like we were close up or in their face.’ Coming for her: The divers saw Umberger from a distance away and swam at her . Not near to them: This shot from the beginning of the video shows how far they were from the other divers, there appears to be no provocation . She believes the man, and another diver he was with, were reef fisherman skimming the area for fish to take back to land and sell for use in aquariums – which she says damages the ecosystem. ‘The greater issue is that Hawaii's reefs are being emptied by these commercial operations,’ said Umberger. ‘Hawaii's reefs are suffering incredibly from this unlimited collection.’ Reef fishing is legal in Hawaii provided the fisherman has the proper permit and adheres to seasonal, territorial and quantity rules, Hawaii News Now noted. It is not clear if the aggressor was breaking any of those rules. Umberger insists she will press charges against her attacker.They have yet to be filed .","Rene Umberger claims she was attacked last week by another diver while underwater off the coast of Kona, Hawaii .

"By . Louise Boyle . The man who famously put aside his Big Mac to help rescue three women held captive in a Cleveland house for more than a decade has published his memoir. Charles Ramsey took to Reddit to answer questions about the moment of bravery which turned him into a local hero and propelled him into the national spotlight. He has written a book about his life before and after last year's extraordinary events, Dead Giveaway. Mr Ramsey told fans during an online Q&A session on Tuesday that he sees Michelle Knight several nights of the week in his Cleveland neighborhood while she walks her dog. Scroll down for MailOnline's exclusive video interview . Charles Ramsey has published his memoirs Dead Giveaway this week - an account of his life before, during and after the dramatic rescue of three kidnapped women in Cleveland, Ohio on May 6, 2013 . One Reddit user asked Mr Ramsey if he kept in touch with the women he rescued on May 6 last year - Amanda Berry, along with her six-year-old daughter who was born in captivity, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight. He responded: 'I see Michelle . Knight several nights a week. Her thing is to walk her dog and meet and . greet people. My thing is to walk around looking for bad dudes who want . to snatch another child.' He said that Ms Knight was catching up with technology after spending 11 years locked up in Ariel Castro's house of horrors. Mr Ramsey also told users that Ms Knight had been working with TV psychologist Dr Phil. 'Michelle has a tablet. They keep her up to date . with things. She's with Dr. Phil's camp,' he wrote on the Reddit feed. 'She's getting emails, . responding to them. Knows how to download apps. She's actually created . music she wants to produce some day.' Ramsey, 44, who had been working as a dishwasher, described in his book how an ordinary Monday last May took an extraordinary turn. Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight were rescued from Ariel Castro's house of horrors on May 6, 2013 after Miss Berry was able to break through a storm door and cry for help. Mr Ramsey came to her rescue . Mr Ramsey writes that morning he rose early and was collecting his mail when he found a letter for Ariel Castro, his next-door neighbor, mixed in with his pile. He walked down to hand it to Castro, who was standing outside his home, getting ready to leave for work. Mr Ramsey wrote: 'Ariel Castro seemed like a normal, regular good neighbor. He pretty much kept to himself, but when we saw each other we always said hi. He would often barbeque in his back yard and we’d share some ribs, pork chops, burgers, and chicken.' Castro would often have a little girl at his cookouts, who Mr Ramsey believed to be his granddaughter. Mr Ramsey said on Reddit on Tuesday that, with hindsight, Castro was doing everything to keep people from asking about his house. He wrote that later that same day around 5pm, he walked over for his beloved Big Mac meal from a local McDonald's. Arriving home, he sat down on the porch to enjoy his Big Mac and fries when he heard a loud banging from the house next door and a woman scream: 'Somebody help!'

The . woman, who later would be known as missing Amanda Berry, had managed to . squeeze her left arm out of the gap from where she was trapped behind . the door. Mr Ramsey said that the door was locked from the inside and was holding firm. He then told Miss Berry: 'Get the f*** back, b****.... I'm gonna kick the door in.' Ramsey’s expletive-ridden 911 call and . his colorful account of setting aside his McDonald’s food to help went . viral, while a CNN interview he gave was turned into a song by the . Gregory Brothers called Dead Giveaway - which he used as the title of his book. Ramsey was flown first-class with his friends to New York City last May for an interview on NightLine. While waiting for their plane, Mr Ramsey received a call from the White House. He wrote that a cabinet secretary who works for President Obama called to pass on a message. Mr Ramsey was a little disappointed, he recalled, asking: 'Dis ain’t Barack?' The secretary responded: 'No, Mr. Ramsey. The president has seen on the news what you did. He’s very grateful for what you did for those girls.' Mr Ramsey answered: 'Uh, thanks. Just did what I had to do, bro.' His . heroic actions turned Mr Ramsey into an instant celebrity and indeed, on the Reddit thread, many of the . commentors thanked him for his bravery.

He wrote: 'Sing . that jungle in your head and when it starts making sense to you, it . won't bother you anymore. 'The world is your neighborhood now. You're in . their heart, you're in their brains.' Mr Ramsey was also asked on Reddit how life had changed for him after the events of last year. He . said : 'Life has changed because I thought I was a good judge of . character. I'm 44. You figure there is no way in the hell you could not . see something demonic seven inches away from where you lay your head. 'What's stayed the same? My sanity.' He also admitted in the online Q&A that he would have killed Castro if he had the opportunity, writing on Reddit: 'That b****** got over on me. I should have killed him a long time ago.' He told one Reddit user, who asked what he would have done differently last year, that he would have got Castro 'pregnant five times and beat the babies out of him '. Following his book tour, Mr Ramsey plans to work on a campaign in Cleveland that demolishes abandoned buildings and houses. He wrote on Tuesday: 'If we get rid of rest havens for pedofiles [sic], we even the game. Right now, you could kidnap some kids in Cleveland and put them anywhere.'

"By . Leon Watson . The Pentagon is trying to transfer convicted national security leaker Private Chelsea Manning to a civilian prison so she can get treatment for her gender disorder, it was revealed today. Defense officials said Manning, formerly named Bradley, has asked for hormone therapy, sex reassignment surgery and to be able to live as a woman. The soldier was convicted of sending classified documents to anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks. Her request was the first ever made by a transgender military inmate and set up a dilemma for the Defense Department: How to treat a soldier for a diagnosed disorder without violating long-standing military policy. Scroll down for video . Chelsea Manning wearing a wig and lipstick. In an unprecedented move, the Pentagon is trying to transfer the convicted national security leaker to a civilian prison so she can get treatment for her gender disorder . Transgender people are not allowed to serve in . the U.S. military and the Defense Department does not provide such . treatment, but Manning cannot be discharged from the service while . serving his 35-year prison sentence. Some officials have said privately that keeping the soldier in a military prison and unable to have treatment could amount to cruel and unusual punishment. Chuck Hagel, the defense secretary, last month gave the Army approval to try to work out a transfer plan with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which does provide such treatment, two Pentagon officials said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record. 'No decision to transfer Pvt. Manning to a civilian detention facility has been made, and any such decision will, of course, properly balance the soldier's medical needs with our obligation to ensure she remains behind bars,' Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said. The two agencies are just starting discussions about prospects for a transfer, the two officials said. The Army has a memorandum of agreement with the Bureau of Prisons for use of several hundred beds and has sent an average of 15 to 20 prisoners a year to civilian prisons. But circumstances are different in Manning's case. Chelsea, then Bradley, Manning is escorted out of a courthouse in Fort Meade, Maryland, America . U.S. Army Private Bradley Manning (centre) being escorted out of a courthouse following the closing arguments in his pre-trial hearing at Fort Meade, Maryland, in 2011 . Lorna Bouge, from Limerick, joins anti-war protesters as they mount a Free Chelsea Manning demonstration at the US Embassy in Dublin, the day after he was sentenced to 35 years in prison for sending classified information to WikiLeaks . The Army normally transfers some prisoners to federal prisons after all military appeals have been exhausted and discharge from military service has been executed. Cases of national security interest are not normally approved for transfer from military custody to the federal prison system. The former intelligence analyst was sentenced in August for six Espionage Act violations and 14 other offenses for giving WikiLeaks more than 700,000 secret military and U.S. State Department documents, along with battlefield video, while working in Iraq in 2009 and 2010. An Army general later upheld the convictions, clearing the way for an appeal at the Army Court of Criminal Appeals. After the conviction, Manning announced the desire to live as a woman and to be called Chelsea, a name change that was approved last month by a Leavenworth County District Judge and that the military did not oppose. The soldier has been diagnosed by military doctors multiple times — including last fall after arriving at the Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, prison — with gender dysphoria, the sense of being a woman in a man's body. By November, a military doctor there had approved a treatment plan, including hormone therapy, but it was sent higher up the chain of command for consideration, according to a complaint filed by Manning in March over the delay in getting treatment. The plan the military was considering has not been publicly released, but Manning said in the complaint that she had specifically asked that the treatment 'plan consider ... three types of treatment.' Those were 'real life experience' — a regimen in which the person tries dressing and living as the sex they want to transition to (something not possible in the Leavenworth men's facility); hormone therapy, which changes some physical traits such as breast and hair growth; and sex reassignnment surgery. Manning has not been specific about possible surgery, but experts in transgender health say it can include any of a large number of procedures such as chest reconstruction, genital reconstruction and plastic surgery such as facial reconstruction. Hagel said Sunday that the prohibition on transgender individuals serving in the armed forces 'continually should be reviewed.' He didn't indicate whether he believes the policy should be overturned but said 'every qualified American who wants to serve our country should have an opportunity if they fit the qualifications and can do it.'

"By . Ashley Collman . and David Mccormack . Ex-NBA star Magic Johnson is taking the high-road after being called a bad example for youth by Donald Sterling. Sterling, the 80-year-old owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, slammed Johnson in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper in which he was supposed to be apologizing for making racist comments. Instead, Sterling targeted Johnson, saying the NBA star isn't doing enough to help minorities and is a bad role model since he caught HIV. Cooper gave Johnson the opportunity to respond to Sterling's statements in an interview Tuesday night in which Johnson says he's praying for the reviled team owner. 'I'm going to pray for the man because even if I see him today, I'm going to say hello to Donald and his wife as well,' Johnson said. Scroll down for video . Taking the high road: Johnson was forgiving of Donald Sterling in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, after the disgraced Clippers owner called him a bad role model . 'I'm not a guy who holds grudges and all that. Yes, am I upset? Of course! But at the same time, I'm a God fearing man and I'm going to pray for him and hope things work out for him.' But Johnson also said that Sterling's behavior shouldn't be tolerated in the league and hopes the NBA's Board of Governors will work swiftly to force him out. ''The problem is he's living in . the stone age. He can’t make those comments about African Americans and Latinos,' he said. As for the personal punches at himself, Johnson said Sterling is 'reaching' and looking for someone to take away the attention from his own problems. Sterling made headlines last month when audio recordings were released of him telling his then-girlfriend V.Stiviano not to bring black people to her games. Johnson was dragged into the scandal since Sterling was recorded admonishing Stiviano for posting a picture of herself with black Johnson on Instagram. At the center of the controversy: V. Stiviano (right) posted a picture of her and Magic Johnson on her Instagram, causing Sterling to get mad at her and telling her not to pose for pictures with black people . The disgraced Clippers owner spoke out for the first time since being banned from the NBA in the Monday interview, and apologzied for his racist comments before turning on Johnson. Sterling first said the basketball legend was a ‘good person’ but his tone quickly changed and he made a series of disparaging remarks about Johnson's HIV-positive status, dismissing his work in charity and business and saying he's not a proper role model for children. During the . Tuesday interview, Johnson said he's tired of talking about Sterling, . especially since he doesn't know V. Stiviano and 'barely' knows . Sterling. Johnson said Sterling should have apologized and 'just left it there'. 'Magic . Johnson shouldn't have been included in your conversation because I . have nothing to do with this but since your put me in it again and you . want to try and disrespect me and the work I;ve done in the minority . community - that makes me upset,' Johnson said. Sterling started by apologizing for his racist comments, but as the interview progressed he blamed the media for blowing his words out of proportion before turning on Magic Johnson . Disgraced LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling used his Monday night interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper to launch an angry attack against Magic Johnson . Johnson also reacted to Sterling's ignorant comments about his HIV infection. 'Big Magic Johnson what has he done? ...he's got AIDS,' Sterling said Monday. Anderson corrected Sterling, explaining that Johnson was diagnosed HIV-positive in 1991 but did not have 'full-blown AIDS.' 'What kind of a guy goes to every city, . has sex with every girl, then he catches HIV. Is that someone we want to . respect, and tell our kids about?' Sterling said. 'I think he should be . ashamed of himself. I think he should go into the background' In the Tuesday interview, Johnson said a large part of his foundation's work is to educate people like Donald Sterling who still don't know the difference between HIV and AIDS and fear those who have contracted the virus. Teaching: Johnson said part of the work of his foundation is to educate people like Sterling who are still uninformed about HIV/AIDS . Not trying to steal Sterling's team: While Johnson said he would definitely make an offer on the Clippers if they came up for sale, he is more interested in owning the Lakers - his old team . Johnson also talked about the moment he came out as HIV positive in 1991, and how he has since raised over $15million dollars to assist patients through is foundation. Sterling also told Anderson Cooper that Johnson called him up after the scandal and told him not to do anything and that he now believes it was a trick so Johnson could buy the team. While Johnson says he would definitely attempt to buy the team if it comes up for sale in the future, the Clipppers aren't his dream team...and it was Sterling that called him. 'If i was going to trick somebody, deceive somebody, be dishonest to somebody, steal somebody's franchise... its going to be the Los Angeles Lakers. it wont be the LA Clippers,' Johnson joked. Johnson said Sterling called him when he was scheduled to do an interview with Barbara Walters, asking Johnson to come on the interview with him and support him. 'I told him I wouldn't do it,' Johnson said.Ii said the number one thing you need to do which you haven't done is apologize to everybody and myself.' Sterling ended up cancelling his appearance with Walters and estranged girlfriend Stiviano sat down instead for a solo talk. The woman behind the tapes: Sterling's estranged girlfriend V. Stiviano was the first to speak about the scandal in an interview with ABC's Barbara Walters last week . Video: Sterling claims his remarks were motivated by jealousy not racism . Sterling went on to question Johnson's work giving back to impoverished African American communities. 'I mean what am I going to say? Has he done everything he can do to help minorities? I don't think so. But I’ll say it, he's great. But I don't think he's a good example for the children of Los Angeles.' 'Did he do any business? ... Did he help anybody in South L.A.? ... What does he do for the black people? Doesn't do anything.' Sterling seemed unaware of the work that the basketball legend has done for over 20 years with his charity organization.Since he launched the Magic Jonson . Foundation in 1991, the former basketball star has raised millions . of dollars to underprivileged children and minority entrepreneurs. 'Jews, when they get successful, they will help their people,' Sterling said. 'Some of the African-Americans, they don’t want to help anyone.' Johnson said he found it sad that Sterling was so clearly uninformed and unprepared for such an important interview. 'I wish he just knew the facts when he's talking but he's a man who's upset and he's reaching and he's looking for something to grab onto to save his team and its not going to happen,' Johnson said. When Cooper spoke about the accusations that Sterling had a 'plantation mentality', the 80-year-old said that the CNN presenter was more of a racist than he was . Sterling expressed the opinion that his Clippers players still love him and that he hopes to keep his team, an idea Johnson called 'delusional' in the Tuesday interview. He says he . doesn't believe the players or the fans want Sterling, or any of his . family members, on team leadership and hopes the NBA's Board of . Directors will act swiftly to push him out. 'I'm hoping they understand that we can't have this type of action in our league. We just can't have it.' Following Sterling's interview, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver released a statement offering an apology on behalf of the 'NBA family'. 'I feel compelled on behalf of the NBA family to apologize to him that he continues to be dragged into this situation and be degraded by such a malicious and person attack. The NBA Board of Governors is continuing with its process to remove Mr Sterling as expenditiously as possible,' he said. Johnson . had tweeted after the recording emerged last month that he would never . attend another Clippers game while Sterling was owner. But he was in . attendance at Sunday's playoff game against the Oklahoma City Thunder . sitting next to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who handed down Sterling's . lifetime ban and a $2.5 million fine nearly two weeks ago. Johnson told Cooper that he changed his mind and decided to attend the game in order to support the Clippers players and Silver's decision. At the conclusion of the interview, Johnson offered some advice to Sterling, telling the Clippers owner to sell his team and enjoy a retirement. Under attack: Sterling made a series of disparaging remarks about Magic Johnson's HIV-positive status, his charity work and said he's not a proper role model for children . Sterling told Anderson Cooper that when his racist rant first made the news, Johnson called him up and told him not to do anything. He now believes this was a trick so Johnson could come in and take over the Clippers .","The former LA Lakers star spoke with CNN's Anderson Cooper to respond to comments disgraced Clippers owner Donald Sterling made about him .

"By . Olivia Williams . Caught on camera: David Jones went on the rampage in Manchester with a replica gun . Dramatic footage of a 'shotgun-wielding' robber threatening staff in a bookmakers and a petrol station has been released today. David Jones, 40, is now starting a five-year jail sentence after going on the rampage with an imitation shotgun. Police said he caused terror as he carried out the raids in the Oldham area of Greater Manchester wearing a balaclava and hi-visibility jacket. Manchester Crown Court heard that Jones was in debt and used the replica in a bid to pay off what he owed. At around 9.30pm on 11 May this year, Jones drove a Vauxhall Astra up to the kiosk of an Asda . petrol station in Chadderton, Greater Manchester. He managed to steal several hundred pounds at the petrol station after pointing the imitation gun at a clerk. She handed over the cash before he drove off. The next day he tried his luck again at a William Hill bookmakers in Rochdale. At 8.25pm, he walked into the . shop where there were two cashiers and a customer. He was carrying his fake gun in a black plastic bin liner and demanded staff gave him money.

Trying his luck: Jones has successfully stolen money from a petrol station the night before and was looking to repeat his success . Terror: Jones walked around the William Hill bookmakers on Oldham Road, Rochdale in his balaclava and high visibility jacket . The . staff, who ran into the back after seeing Jones walk in wearing a . balaclava, did not give him any and he walked off empty handed. He drove . off in the Vauxhall Astra. Detective Constable Dave Meeney from the . Serious Organised Crime Group said: 'Following a police investigation, . Jones led us to a mill off Osborne Street that he had access to. 'Inside, . we found the car, a high vis jacket that he wore during the first . crime, his balaclava and the imitation gun.'

Threatening: Hoping to pay off his considerable debts, Jones demanded staff give him money but they had run for safety . Empty-handed: Staff had gone to the safe room and refused to hand over any money to him . 'They were naturally scared when they were faced with a man wearing a balaclava and holding a weapon.' 'In the second incident at William Hill, the staff members were able to lock themselves in the back office and nothing was taken.

"By . James  Nye . and Alex Greig . Sheriff's in Putnam County, Georgia, investigating the disappearance of an Eatonton woman and the gruesome murder of her husband have said the Mafia was not involved and neither were in witness protection. One week after 88-year-old Russell Dermond's decapitated body was found in the garage of his $1 million lakefront home, his 87-year-old wife Shirley Dermond is still missing. Putnam Sheriff Howard Sills said that despite unfounded rumors of organized crime involvement, they are no closer to finding a motive for the murder and are confident that Mrs. Dermond will he found alive. Mystery: Police are unsure who killed Russell Dermond (left) or where his wife Shirley Dermond (right) is . Quiet area: Sheriff Howard Sills said there hasn't been a break-in in the gated, guarded community for 18 years, and the Dermond's home bore no signs of forced entry or struggle . 'I’m running down one thing after another and coming up empty,' Sills said Tuesday according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Sills added that there was no evidence that the mob had anything to do with the murder and disappearance. 'No, the man wasn’t in witness protection,' he said. 'He wasn’t going to testify. There’s no evidence of any kind of torture.' Investigators believe Russell Dermond’s head, yet to be recovered, was severed after he was killed. On Tuesday the Department of Natural Resources used a submarine to search the bottom of the peninsula off of Lake Oconee near to their Reynold's Plantation home. So far they have only found a ladder. Friends of Russell and Shirley Dermond found the body of 88-year-old Russell Dermond in the garage of the $1million home Tuesday and called the police, Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills said. They went looking after not hearing from the couple for days. Lakeside idyll: The Dermonds lived quietly in their waterfront home and were described by their pastor as a 'sweet' and 'unassuming' couple . Unexplained: Police believe the perpetrator may have accessed the Dermonds' home by the water and that the attack was isolated and premeditated . County coroner Gary P. McElhenney said that the man had been decapitated. Police believe the attack happened sometime between Friday and Sunday, Sills said. Shirley Dermond, 87, was not at the home when authorities arrived at the home in the Great Waters and investigators believe she may have been abducted. 'I do not believe this to be a random attack and I base that on several things,' Sills told WSB-TV. 'No evidence of forced entry or struggle or things like that.' Shirley Dermond is described as five feet two inches tall and 148 pounds. She has gray hair and blue eyes. She is not considered a suspect in her husband’s death, Sills said. The bizarre attack has detectives baffled and police are deeply concerned for the safety of Shirley Dermond. Nothing appeared to have been stolen from the home, with the couple's cell phones, cars and other valuable items found still in the home. 'I'm not optimistic given the fact of her husband's circumstances, holding out hope for the family,' Sills said. 'We still approach this as if she's been abducted and we pray that she is alive but we don't know anything about where Ms. Dermond is.' Sills said it's very difficult to track where Shirley Dermond might have gone since her cell phone, wallet and car were all left behind. Concern: Neighbors became worried after not seeing the couple for days and discovered the headless body of Russell Dermond in the garage and Shirley Dermond missing . No weapon was recovered from the attack. The couple's children have traveled to their home while police investigate. One of the the Dermonds' sons, Bradley Dermond, described his parents Wednesday as 'salt of the Earth.' 'This absolutely makes no sense at all,' he told USA Today. 'We're still hoping that our mother is OK.' Sills added that authorities are investigating whether the attacker may have approached the couple’s home from the lake. 'This is a huge lake,' he said. 'It spans four counties and entry could’ve been made by the lake.' The home is located in the gated Great Waters community on Lake Oconee, a guarded, gated community with no public access. According to 2013 tax records the couple's home, boat dock and land is worth $1,043,094. The Dermond's move to the home from Atlanta after he retired. He used to own fast food franchises. Neither of the couple had any history of mental illness nor known health problems. The couple has three children, two sons and a daughter, all of whom live out of state and are cooperating with investigators. The last contact any of the children had with their parents was April 29th. Sills told Channel 2 that there hasn't been a home invasion in the area for 18 years. The Dermonds' neighbors are shocked that such a violent crime had been committed against the couple. 'We were all in shock and we really just don't know how they'd have any enemies or anybody who'd want to do anything to them,' the Reverend David Key of Oconee Lake Community Church told USA Today. 'They're the last couple that you would think anybody would break in and do this kind of violence to.'","Russell Dermond, 88, was found decapitated in his lakefront home last week and his wife Shirley Dermond, 87, is still missing .
