'Hurt': Tina Greenland, 49, told police her boss had spiked her drink and raped her when he made it clear he did not want a relationship after they had sex . A 'scorned' nanny was jailed for two years for claiming her wealthy boss had raped her after he shunned her following a one-night stand. Divorcee Tina Greenland, 49, shared a night of passion with insurance broker Nicholas Mouna, 55, after he employed her to care for his disabled daughter. The mother of three texted him the next day saying she 'had a lovely night' and that she hoped he did not think she was 'some kind of tart', Canterbury Crown Court heard. When Mr Mouna gave a 'half-hearted' response making it clear he did not want a relationship, she accused him of 'using' her. She then phoned Kent Police and claimed she had been raped after her drink had been spiked. Mr Mouna was arrested and suspended from his job, which he later lost - despite never being charged for the crime. When detectives examined messages exchanged between the pair, they discovered Greenland's rape claims were fabricated. Jailing her for two years, Judge Nigel Van Der Bijl - quoting from poet William Congreve - said 'hell hath no fury like a woman scorned'. He said: 'You have been found guilty on the clearest of evidence of making false allegations. 'But this is serious because people who make false allegations make it harder for real victims to be believed.' Greenland, of Folkstone, Kent, screamed, 'Oh no, my God no', as the sentence was passed. She maintained her innocence throughout her trial, but her account of what happened on the night in December last year was rejected by the jury. The child carer, who had been employed by Mr Mouna through an agency, was found guilty of perverting the course of justice. Jurors were told how Greenland pursued Mr Mouna - who has three children with his ex-wife - and sent him text messages asking him to go for a drink. 'Rejected': Divorced Greenland, 49, accused insurance broker Nicholas Mouna, 55, of 'using' her and then took an overdose of tablets and vodka . John Traversi, prosecuting, said: 'In 2011, Greenland began caring for the girl and after a while she began asking Mr Mouna if he would like to go to a country club for a drink and she began sending him texts. 'These texts intrigued him and flattered him and they agreed to go out in December.' In December, the divorcee arrived at his home carrying a bottle of vodka after being 'dropped off' by her daughter and the pair shared a kiss. Mr Traversi said: 'They had some drinks and they sat on the sofa and put her arms around him and kissed again and had some more drinks.' He added that during the evening Greenland felt dizzy and she became 'hot and sweaty'. Greenland went upstairs and was sick, but returned later to watch TV until 'he felt tired'. Falsehoods: Greenland was found guilty of perverting the course of justice and jailed for two years . The prosecutor added: 'Both of them went upstairs and Greenland said: ""Which room?"". He said: ""The big one... if you want."" 'The two then got into bed where they had sexual intercourse and engaged in other sexual activity during the course of the night.' The court heard the following morning they woke up at 11am and had breakfast together before leaving. Mr Traversi said: 'On the way home she asked if they would be seeing each other again... and he gave a half-hearted response.' Later in the day, Greenland texted him saying: 'Hi Nick, just to say had a lovely night. Sorry about the sick and I do hope that you do not think that I am some kind of tart for sleeping with you. 'I would like to see you again and really do hope you do me. But if you don’t want to I won’t mind. Of course, it would be nice...' Mr Mouna replied that he 'quite liked my single life', adding, 'I am quite happy to meet up with you and do it again with you'. She replied: 'No, thanks for all that. I have just been used. Thanks a lot.' Hours later, Greenland took an overdose of tablets and vodka and was rushed to hospital. She had texted Mr Traversi saying: 'Well I hope you sort your life out because at the moment I feel like ending mine. I have got vodka and pills I just hope I don’t wake up.' Paul Hogben, defending, said Greenland 'couldn’t cope with rejection.' Mr Hogben said after the verdict that the text that Greenland received 'would have hurt anyone' and was read as 'I don’t want to see you anymore'. He said: 'She reacted in the wrong way and she did make some effort to try to stop the ball from rolling but the consequences were that Mr Mouna was investigated for rape. 'She is not a bad person, but by the jury’s verdict she did a bad thing. She made a terrible mistake in circumstances when she couldn’t cope with rejection.'","Tina Greenland, 49, texted Nicholas Mouna, 55, to say she had enjoyed their night together and hoped he did not think she was 'a tart'

An elderly couple have been billed £500 by their TV company - for hundreds of pornographic films they say they never ordered. Great-grandparents Ron Hayward, 74, and wife Ann, 71, were stunned when Virgin Media demanded the money, saying 150 pay-per-view adult films had been streamed to their cable TV account. It is the second time the couple, from Reddish, near Manchester, have been caught in a row over porn films with Virgin. Up to 14 films a day: Great-grandparents Ron and Ann Hayward were billed for porn they say they did not watch . In 2009 they were also accused of ordering £190 of adult movies.Virgin eventually tore up the bill and turned off the couple’s service. But earlier this year the couple decided to resubscribe to the catch-up and on-demand services. Within days, dozens of adult films had been ordered, seemingly from the couple’s address, including 14 in one day. Stream of pornography: A page of the Haywards' bill showing just how many adult films they are supposed to have ordered . And there's more: Countless adult movies charged at £5.99 a time meant a hefty bill . Virgin has again waived the charge - but the couple says they have been told they will be liable for any future bills if they want the TV services reconnecting. Mrs Hayward, a retired nursery nurse, said: 'It feels to us just like groundhog day. 'We had this problem before and we thought when we re-applied to be connected that Virgin would have solved the problem of what went wrong previously. 'The family all think it is really funny - Ron gets ribbed at the post office where he gets asked if he’s seen any good films lately.' Virgin Media: The TV provider has waived the charges for the Haywards for the second time . Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson: The Haywards hope he will be able to resolve their problem . A Virgin spokesman said the films must have been accessed from the couple's account because a secret PIN number was needed to watch the films. 'Adult content can only be viewed after an individual PIN number is given by the household, ensuring people can safely watch the content they choose. 'We’ve made sure Mr and Mrs Hayward’s service is PIN-protected and their TV set-top box will no longer be able to view age-restricted content.' Mrs Hayward added: 'I would like to make a direct appeal to Sir Richard Branson, to say to him he needs to sort it out. 'We are loyal customers, we were told by a manager at Virgin that we can have the catch-up, which is what we want, but we have to take on demand as well, which we don’t want. 'We were also told if we have the service again we will be expected to sign an agreement to say we are liable for any more film orders. We feel like we are being penalised.'","Great-grandparents Ron and Ann Hayward, from Manchester, were charged for 'watching' 150 adult films .

First Minister Alex Salmond has insisted an independent Scotland would automatically join the EU . Scotland will have to make a new application to join the European Union if voters back independence, a Foreign Office minister warned today. Hugo Swire told MPs that ‘everything would change’ if Scots vote to go it alone in the referendum due in autumn 2014. An independent Scotland would not automatically be a member of the EU and would have to ‘start afresh’, he added. The comments are the strongest from a government minister on the issue of Scotland’s status in the EU, which has become the focus of early skirmishes in the independence debate. Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond was ridiculed after claiming in a TV interview that he had obtained legal advice on EU membership but it had to remain secret. He later admitted no advice had been sought. In a debate in Westminster Hall today, Mr Swire said it was ‘only an assertion’ that an independent Scotland would simply continue in membership of the EU. The Scottish independence referendum is being held in autumn 2014, when Mr Salmond hopes to capitalise on a patriotic mood marking 700th anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn . He added: ‘The UK has managed to . negotiate, over the years, exemptions from membership of the euro and . from the Schengen common visa area, ensuring that the UK can maintain . control over its own monetary and border policies. “But . the fact is that if Scotland became independent, everything would . change.  Independence is not simply an extension of the devolution . arrangements that have worked so well. Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire said Scotland would have to 'start afresh' if voters back independence . ‘It . is not merely a further point on the constitutional continuum.  It is a . fundamental change – a definitive split from the rest of the UK, an . irreversible step.  Independence would bring devolution to an end.’ If Scotland backed independence, England, Northern Ireland and Wales would continue the international legal personality of the UK. ‘Scotland, having decided to leave the UK, would start afresh.  The overwhelming weight of international legal precedent underscores this point. ‘The most likely scenario by far is that an independent Scotland would have to apply to join the EU as a new state, involving negotiation with the rest of the UK and other Member States, the outcome of which cannot be predicted. ‘ . Further analysis will be published by the UK government next year. Earlier SNP MP Pete Wishart claimed Scotland would be able to remain in the EU. ‘We remain members of the EU because the UK took us into the European Union in 1973. ‘When Scotland secures its independence, the Act of Union will fall and there will be two successor states. Whatever happens to an independent Scotland will happen to the rest of the United Kingdom - that's what happened in Czechoslovakia.’","Hugo Swire tells MPs Scotland will have to 'start afresh' if voters decide to go it alone in 2014 .

One wrong turning became a 24-hour rescue mission after a hapless Polish lorry driver followed his sat-nav into a dead end. He had ignored signs warning that the road was not suitable for HGVs and got the 40ft wagon stuck on a tight bend. A team of around ten workers from a specialist recovery team then spent more than 15 hours digging out earth from the side of the road to ease it free. Stuck in the mud: The lorry driver was left red-faced after he followed his sat nav down a dirt track and got trapped on a tight bend . Team effort: Ten workers and a local farmer spent 15 hours digging out the lorry in Higher Sutton, Cheshire . A local farmer eventually helped out by offering the use of his digger while villagers gathered at the scene and brought coffee and sandwiches for the workers. Police said a wall had been left damaged following the incident in Higher Sutton, Cheshire. Officers attended at about 9am last Tuesday and closed off Heathcotes Lane before calling out vehicle recovery firm The Mansfield Group. The truck - registered in Warsaw, Poland -  had been on its way to deliver industrial yarn to textiles firm Hardings, based in Langley. It was eventually released in the early hours of Wednesday morning and successfully made its delivery later that day without any damage to the goods inside. No entry: The driver ignored warning signs that the road wasn't suitable for HGVs . All hands to the pump: Local villagers brought coffee and sandwiches for the workers as they battled for hours to free the lorry . Villager Howard Self, 58, watched the drama unfold with his wife and two children. He said: 'I just couldn’t believe he had got round the first bend. He must have gone right up the bank and nearly tipped over. 'You couldn’t even squeeze around the side of it, that’s how narrow the lane is. It was completely trapped. They were still digging it out when I went to bed that night at 11:30pm.' Mr Self said although incidents of this type were rare in the village, it showed the perils of relying on sat-navs. 'I did feel sorry for the chap because he must have been in his sixties and he spoke virtually no English. 'But if you’re a HGV driver and you see you’re going down a narrow country lane you should know not to go any further. You have got to be sensible using them.' The Mansfield Group and Hardings both declined to comment. There are signs on entering the village which warn lorry drivers the roads aren’t suitable for HGVs. But local councillor Hilda Gaddum said it was still a problem and more needs to be done to tackle it. She said: 'It’s an ongoing problem and I’m very worried about it. These lorries are blindly following sat-navs and are ignoring signs and weight restrictions. 'It’s not fair on residents who end up with their roads blocked.' Recurring theme: Local councillor Hilda Gaddum said the number of lorrys getting stuck on the road is an 'ongoing problem' 'And I am concerned about pedestrians and cyclists potentially being hits, as well as the damage being done to walls. 'The police do what they can, but I think tough action such as impounding some of the lorries, if there is the power to do it, would really send a message out. 'And firms should have to pay for any damage caused.'","Driver got stuck after following sat-nav down a dirt track in the village of Higher Sutton, Cheshire .

Jailed: Gambling addict Sheikh Islam, 35, was jailed for life after murdering his wife in their east London flat in May last year. The court was told that Islam had 'not displayed any sign of remorse' since the incident . A gambler who stabbed his wife to death after she challenged him about his habit has been jailed for life. Sheikh Islam stabbed his wife Rushna Begum, 28, in their council flat in Bromley-by-Bow, east London, while their two-year-old son watched on. The 36-year-old gambling addict left the child alone in the house with his wife's dead body before arriving at a relative's home in tears and asking them to call the police. He was ordered to serve a minimum term of 14-and-a-half years in prison after pleading guilty to murder at the Old Bailey. Islam had been married to Mrs Begum, for 10 years and they had two sons together, but the court heard how thew couple's relationship turned violent as his gambling habit spun out of control. Mrs Begum was subjected to death threats and domestic abuse as the couple's relationship became increasingly frayed. Before the fatal incident, Mrs Begum had contacted police about her husband's abuse and also visited a domestic violence centre after being threatened with a knife. Islam had gambled away up to £90,000 during the marriage, including the profits he . made from selling his takeaway shop in East Ham and a small kiosk, . prosecutor Peter Kyte QC said. Mrs Begum told police that she had been 'mentally tortured' by her husband since his gambling problems began in 2009. In 2011 the couple, who had over £30,000 worth of debt, were taken to court by creditors, which acted as another catalyst for arguments. She complained to her housing manager about her husband's threatening behaviour, saying she was 'extremely concerned' about her safety and the safety of her children. She told the housing manager that her husband had threatened to kill her on 'numerous occasions'. Mrs Begum said that she thought 'the reason is because he is addicted to gambling' and also said that their relationship had 'broken down'. Islam also brandished a knife at his wife after another row in 2011, prompting her to contact police. She told officers that she had been 'mentally tortured for the last two years', the court heard. Only a few days later she attended a domestic violence centre, where she was seen to have a black eye and bruises. In February, the couple's problems had caught the attention of their families who called a meeting to discuss their arguments. During the meeting, Islam accused his . wife of having an affair but also 'begged' her to forgive him for losing . their savings, spending her wages, selling her car and her jewellery. Addict: The court heard how Islam gambled up to £900,000 of the family's money. He spent his wife's wages, as well as selling her jewellery and car (stock image) She decided to stay with him but, a . few weeks later, Islam started to threaten her again and said: 'I will . put an end to your life.' On May 25 2011, the day of the murder, . Islam refused to take a phone call from Mrs Begum’s mother and the . couple started to argue, said defence lawyer Jane Bickerstaff. Islam claimed his . wife said 'I have broken my promise to you' during the argument, which he interpreted as meaning that . she had been unfaithful. He then stabbed her and claimed he thought his son was at nursery, before traveling to see relatives in Luton. Islam arrived crying and trembling and asked his cousin to phone the police. When he was arrested the same day he said: 'I love my wife, I want to die.' Police found the young child alone in the flat 'crying' and discovered a bloodied knife in the bin. The child told police: 'Mummy couldn’t answer the phone because she is sleeping.' Mrs Begum was pronounced dead at the scene. In a statement, Mrs . Begum’s uncle, who helped arrange the marriage, said: 'The children have . had their whole world turned upside down.' He said Mrs Begum’s mother was now . looking after her two grandchildren but the youngest child suffered from . nightmares and was affected by the colour red. Judge Brian Barker, the Common Serjeant of London, said gambling 'had got the better' of Islam and said the addiction led to his 'downfall, misery and finally disaster'. He said Islam had caused 'untold anguish' to Mrs Begum's family and friends. Detective Inspector Pete North described the incident as a 'violent and despicable crime' and said that Islam had not 'displayed any sign of remorse or compassion throughout the investigation'. He added: 'This is demonstrated by the fact that . he murdered Rushna whilst their two-year-old son was present in the . address and then left him alone with his mother’s lifeless body. 'It was only thanks to the concern of family members that he was found over four hours later. The tragedy of Islam’s crime is that he has deprived his two children of their mother.'","Sheikh Islam gambled up to £900,000 during the marriage .

'A sham': Accountant Marian Herron, 59, is claiming unfair dismissal from from Land Securities . An accountant was forced out of her job at a major corporation because of her foreign accent, a tribunal heard today. Model employee Marian Herron, 59, claims she was sacked in a 'sham redundancy process' the day before Land Securities announced a £378.9m profit. Ms Herron, 59, worked as a £40,000-a-year service charge administrator for the FTSE100 firm, which deals in commercial property. Originally from Singapore, she claims bosses singled her out because of her foreign accent coupled with the fact she was nearing retirement age. Ms Herron, who calculated service charges for tenants in the department, lost her job in the reshuffle and was made redundant last November despite good performance and never taking a day off sick. The London Central Employment Tribunal heard a temporary worker in Ms Herron’s department, who was much younger, was offered a permanent job the week before. Land Securities’ portfolio includes some of UK’s largest shopping centres. The tribunal heard Ms Herron had been working at the firm’s head office in the Strand. Judges were told the firm ‘restructured’ the department Ms Herron worked in last summer, cutting staff numbers from 22 to 12. Land Securities, a FTSE100 firm, is the company behind some of London's biggest building projects such as this 630ft high Walkie Talkie Tower in Fenchurch Street, London, set for completion in 2014 . Office: Ms Herron worked as a £40,000-a-year service charge administrator at Land Securities' headquarters based on The Strand in London (pictured) Senior manager Amy Hayward admitted the redundancy process was a 'sham' but denied discrimination on the grounds of race or age. Ms Hayward drew up a job description for the role of 'property accountant' but admitted there was ‘no real distinction’ between that role and Ms Herron's old job. At the tribunal: Land Securities Senior Manager Amy Hayward denies the redundancy process was rigged . ‘It was two ways of saying exactly the same thing,’ she said. She admitted that past performance of workers were not considered when they were forced to re-apply for their jobs. Michael Tanney, representing Ms Herron, asked: ‘Doesn’t it defy logic to rule out the fact that the employee was a much sought out adviser to senior colleagues?’ Ms Hayward replied: ‘Yes it does defy logic, when you put it like that.’ The tribunal also heard that the department made another temporary employee, much younger than Ms Herron, permanent just days before the redundancy process started. That worker kept her job at the firm after the shake-up despite her lack of experience. Ms Hayward denied the process was rigged and that Ms Herron was made redundant unfairly because of her age and accented English. Many of the staff involved in implementing the redundancy process have since lost their jobs, the tribunal heard. Ms Herron is claiming for unfair dismissal, race discrimination and age discrimination. The hearing continues.","Marian Herron, 59, claims she was let go by Land Securities because of her foreign accent and age .

Missing: Police are hunting two women they think may be linked to the disappearance of model Kara Nichols, pictured, who vanished last month . Police are hunting two women they think may be linked to the disappearance of an aspiring teen model who vanished last month. Kara Nichols, 19, went missing after leaving her Colorado Springs home on October 9 and was last seen with a brown-haired woman who detectives believe may have information about the young woman's whereabouts. On Tuesday, El Paso County Sheriff's Office called the case suspicious, adding that Ms Nichols may have been exploited by an individual or group claiming they could further her modelling career. 'Even if this young lady has no information, just the simple fact that she could tell us how they parted, what her parting words might have been, could be huge,' El Paso County Sheriff's Detective Cliff Porter told ABC News. Police are also seeking a second brunette who they said associated with Nichols, however they would not elaborate on the nature of their relationship or frequency of their contact. Ms Nichols told her roommate she might go to Denver on the day she vanished but left behind her purse. Friends and family said the woman was active on social media and regularly used her cell phone, but neither have been used since she went missing. 'All of a sudden that stopped -- no communication since then, especially from a person who was an extrovert, who was always reaching out to people,' Sheriff Terry Maketa said, adding that this made the case 'more concerning.' According to ABC News, images of the unnamed brunette released yesterday have resulted in numerous leads and the El Paso Sheriff's Office has recruited the help of external investigators to help with the case.

They are labor and manpower intensive, and we have . called on other units to assist us,' Detective Porter told the TV . station. Police said there was a strong possibility Ms Nichols was targeted by an organised group designed to exploit wanna-be models. 'These aspirations, we believe, have caused Kara to fall prey to a subculture of modeling-business fronts that many times involve illicit drugs and prostitution,' Sheriff Maketa said. This subculture could have exploited a teenage girl who may have lacked the life experience to see the inherent risks.' The 19-year-old lingerie model disappeared more than a month ago on her way to work.

'What causes us concern is that it is really uncharacteristic of her not to be in contact with her friends and family,' Sergeant Joe Roybal, from the El Paso County Sheriff's Office said earlier this month. Officers' attempts to reach Ms Nichols on her phone or to establish the phone's location have proved unsuccessful.

But Eamonn Holmes and his wife Ruth Langsford seem curiously eager to air their dirty laundry in public. The pair, who co-present ITV’s This Morning on Fridays, have filmed themselves arguing at home and invited YouTube viewers to judge their disputes online. Scroll down to watch video . Airing their dirty laundry: This morning presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford have posted their marital disputes on YouTube . Some may view the project as a transparent bid to replace Richard and Judy as the nation’s favourite bickering TV couple. The videos, entitled He Says, She Says, are certainly designed to provoke debate between the genders on a series of mundane domestic issues. But some viewers will just be interested in their revealing asides and excruciating  bedroom humour. In their three videos to date, Mr Holmes and Miss Langsford, both 52, have argued over whether men can cook, whether married couples need to have ‘date nights’ and whether ornamental cushions are pointless. Sitting in her tidy kitchen, Miss Langsford proclaimed: ‘All the cooking that happens here is done by me. Except of course when the sun comes out, and then Eamonn suddenly decides – a man that never cooks – that he can cook a barbecue. ‘And of course he can’t cook, so eight hours later we have a few burnt sausages and a bit of raw chicken.’ Clearly riled by his wife’s attack, Mr Holmes retorted: ‘It’s me that is making the house a home. We find it difficult getting people to visit us because people don’t like you. ‘But they come because they think, “Eamonn, he’s sociable, he knows how to throw a good BBQ”. This is really about you resenting me in your territory. You don’t want me cooking or in the kitchen. It’s a control thing.’ So far, the videos have gathered a total of 29 comments from viewers siding with one or the other. At times, the clips revel in excruciating innuendo best left in the bedroom. Making no effort to spare the blushes of her online audience, Miss Langsford snapped a pair of barbecue tongs at her husband, and said: ‘Don’t let me come after you for your sausage.’ Discussing date nights, Mr Holmes complained she never makes time for romance. The pair, who have a son Jack, ten, married in 2010 after 12 years together and live in Surrey. Miss Langsford said: ‘When you have kids you can’t be that spontaneous any more, sadly’, prompting her husband’s reply: ‘Your loss. Think of what you’re missing. Think of what it could lead to.’ Mr Holmes was also scornful about his wife’s habit of buying ornamental silk cushions for their bed. She complained he scrunches them up during his daytime naps. In a revealing aside, he said: ‘If I was beside you in bed I would like to scrunch you…You’re not too keen on that either.’ Talking point: The videos are designed to spark debate on everyday household issues between couples .

More than half of those surveyed . admitted wishing they had made a different life choice at some point, . such as having a different career, living somewhere else or marrying . someone different. A fifth of women regretted wasting . time with the wrong partner, compared to 10 per cent of men. But a . quarter of the 2,000 participants said they did not believe it was . possible to live a life without regrets, perhaps explaining why, on . average, we spend 19 minutes per day – or more than two hours a week – . thinking about things we could have done differently. 1.

"By . Steve Robson and Chris Greenwood . PUBLISHED: . 07:10 EST, 22 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:02 EST, 22 November 2012 . Unmasked: Undercover PC Mark Kennedy - also known as Mark 'Flash' Stone - was exposed during a £1million trial involving a lot to invade a power station in 2009 . A group of ten women and one man are suing Scotland Yard alleging they were tricked into personal relationships with undercover officers such as Mark Kennedy causing emotional trauma. The claims emerged as the Met attempted to have their case thrown out of the High Court and heard in a tribunal behind closed doors. Lawyers representing the group claim the highly-secretive court could ‘smother’ the cases of those seeking damages. The women claim specialist officers from the Covert Human Intelligence Source - CHIS - infiltrated environmental activist groups and had sex with them. The man claims damages for a non-sexual incident. The ‘secret justice’ row is the latest twist to the extraordinary saga following the outing of protester Mark Kennedy as an undercover Met police officer. Kennedy, who was married with two children, was dramatically unmasked last year by an environmental protest group he had spied on for seven years. Three women referred to in court had relationships with Kennedy who spent spent seven years living as a long-haired climber called Mark 'Flash' Stone. One woman said she fell in love with Kennedy and believed him to be her ‘soul mate’ - before later finding out that he and a ‘whole team of secret people’ had been ‘digging away at her life.’ The scandal prompted a string of public and internal inquiries and a torrent of questions about how highly-sensitive undercover operations are run. Two other women had sexual relationships with a colleague of Kennedy's who claimed he was a truck driver called Mark Jacobs. Jacobs had taken part in 'deeply personal aspects of their lives', including attending the funeral of one woman's father, the court heard. Legal battle: The Met police are attempting to have the case struck out from the High Court in London so it can be heard by a secretive tribunal instead . As a result of Kennedy’s  exposure, a £1m case against activists accused of planning to invade a power station collapsed - and several women came forward to say they had had affairs with him. A string of other women later came forward to complain that they too had been ‘tricked’ into forming relationships with undercover officers. The group is now suing the Met and the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) alleging negligence, misconduct and deceit at the High Court. One woman bringing a case says an undercover officer fathered her son - now aged 27 - but later vanished from her life. She claims the Met should pay for his upbringing. Compensation: The group of ten women and one man are suing the Met police claiming they were tricked into relationships with undercover officers and suffered emotional trauma . But police have lodged a counter-claim to have the case struck out of the High Court, arguing they should instead be considered by the secretive Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT). The tribunal is the only judicial body with the power to investigate the security services and was set up to consider public complaints about unreasonable surveillance. Those appearing before it have fewer rights than in an ordinary court as there is no obligation to take oral evidence and the vast majority of hearings are held behind closed doors. It has upheld fewer than one in a 100 complaints since it was created in 2000 and complainants are allocated an advocate rather than choosing a lawyer. The tribunal is not required to give reasons for its judgments and there is no automatic right of appeal. The Met argues that because the operations were authorised under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) the claims should not be heard in an ordinary court. Lawyers for the police admitted the women may be entitled to damages if they have a 'legitimate grievance.' Monica Carss-Frisk QC told . Mr. Justice Tugendhat: 'This case is not about denying remedy for any . legitimate grievance. It is about the right forum for determining these . claims.' Eco spy: The trial of six activists after undercover officer Mark Kennedy changed sides and offered to help the defence. 2003 - 2010: As an undercover officer for the Metropolitan police, PC Mark Kennedy infiltrates anumber of activist groups including environmental and anti-racist movements. Using the name Mark 'Flash' Stone he claims to be a professional climber. April 2009 - Police arrest 114 activists at a school near Nottingham in a bid to prevent them from breaking into Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station the next day. Of those, 26 were later charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated trespass. January 2010 - 20 activists were found guilty of the plot to invade the power station but were given lenient sentences. October 2010 - Kennedy is confronted by some of the activists after they discover documents revealing his true identity. He admits to being a Met spy then disappears. January 2011 - The case against the remaining six activists dramatically collapses days before a trial is due to start after Kennedy changes sides and offers to help the defence. The 20 who were convicted appeal their convictions because his identity as an eco spy had been kept secret from the jury. November 2011 - During an interview with Channel 4, Kennedy claims to have been used by the police forces of 22 countries including Germany, Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, Spain and Italy. December 2011 - Eight women started legal action against the Met alleging they suffered emotional trauma after being tricked into personal relationships with undercover officers. March 2012 - Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Greany takes over as head of  the National Domestic Extremism Unit in the wake of the Kennedy scandal. This week - Hearing begins to decide if the claim by ten women and one man that they were tricked into personal relationships with undercover officers can be heard in the High Court. But critics said the move flies in the face of the basic principles of open justice and is yet another example of information being hidden from the public. Green politician Jenny Jones, who sits on a committee that oversees the Met, believes important information is being withheld. She said: ‘I’m very concerned about this because clearly the Met is trying to hide its dirty laundry. ‘These women deserve to have their stories told and for people to understand that what happened to them was a complete betrayal of trust. ‘There seems to be a trend of the State clearly trying to hide its secrets and that’s not acceptable.’ Lawyers from two firms representing the women will argue that sexual relationships with targets are not sanctioned under Ripa. Harriet Wistrich, of Birnberg Peirce, said: ‘These women are suing for a gross invasion of privacy and the Met’s response is to try and hive it off into a secret court.’ Police say undercover officers were ‘never authorised’ to conduct sexual relationships, although a review has been set up to examine cases dating back to the 1980s. But senior officers admit they cannot formally ban intimate contact because it would quickly become a ‘litmus test’ for people looking to identify police. The women claim that the officers deliberately invaded their private lives to spy on them and that the resulting deceit has caused psychological damage. One discovered only recently that her son was fathered by an undercover police officer, who then disappeared from their lives. She is planning a legal claim that will discover whether police should bear some financial responsibility for the child’s upbringing. A Met spokesman said: ‘They are very unusual and complex areas of law. ‘Our legal position is that the Investigatory Powers Tribunal is the proper authority to hear these cases because of the nature of them and the evidence involved but the decision on this will be made by a judge.’","Three women claim they had relationships with mole Mark Kennedy .

Love was quite literally in the air for an unsuspecting cook when her boyfriend proposed to her at 500 feet. Instructor Stuart Black was giving girlfriend Annette MacKenzie her first flying lesson when he asked her to look down into a field. 'Marry me Annettte' had been carved in 25-foot long letters into the stubble field below and when she looked back Mr Black was holding a diamond engagement ring. She said yes straight away. With a little help from his friends: Stuart Black got farmer school mate John Watt to carve the proposal into the field in 25-foot long letters . Birds eye: This aerial shot shows just how large the letters needed to be to allow Ms MacKenzie to see them from 500 feet . The groom-to-be had originally planned on popping the question at Christmas but brought it forward as he is due to leave for the Gulf for four months on duty with the RAF. Ms MacKenzie, from Dunvegan, Isle of Skye, said she had no idea he was planning to propose. The 37-year-old said: 'It was such a surprise, I haven’t quite got over it yet. 'I was so nervous doing a flying lesson for the first time and then all of a sudden Stuart said I should look down at the field outside as I might see something. 'We had just flown over Gleneagles so I thought it was going to be another big building or something, but there were all these words and I couldn’t quite take them all in. 'I turned around and there was Stuart holding a ring and it all clicked. 'Normally he can’t keep anything quiet so I’m amazed I never found out beforehand.' The pair live more than 200 miles apart and first met on Facebook two years ago but only saw each other face-to-face in December. They have yet to set a date but are considering marrying in December next year - two years after they first 'clicked'. Flying high: Annette Mackenzie, 37, and Stuart Black, 39, are considering setting a date for December next year - two years after they met face-to-face . Mr Black, 39, of Crieff, Perthshire, said the dramatic proposal had taken months of planning and he enlisted the help of his childhood friend John Watt, who a farm. Mr Black said: 'At first I had this idea of proposing in the air while Annette was having a flying lesson, as it would be something different. 'Then I thought, why not have something marked out on the ground? 'So I contacted my friend John who owns a farm and we came up with a plan to carve a proposal into a field. 'He used a machine which just cuts the first three inches into the field and the letters were 25 metres long - it was massive. 'I suppose I just wanted to do something unique.' But the carefully laid plan almost did not come to fruition when the weather was too bad to fly. Mr Black had arranged an early 'Christmas Day' with his family so he could celebrate before going on the RAF tour to the Gulf at the end of the month. He had intended to propose on November 15 but he could not fly. But luckily, for Mr Black a window of clear sky the following meant they could take to the skies. He said: 'Annette thought the flying lesson was just a Christmas present so she was absolutely stunned when I proposed. 'She turned around and saw me holding the ring out to her and it’s fair to say she was quite emotional and she said ‘yes’ straight away, which was lovely. 'We had all the family up for our early Christmas and of course they were waiting with the bubbly back at home - so it was quite special.' On their unusual courtship, school caterer Ms MacKenzie said: 'We had mutual friends and I think Stuart just added me as a friend one day and we just got chatting, then we began phoning and emailing too. 'Last December Stuart came up the Skye to meet me for the first time and we just clicked.” Her future-husband added: 'It was quite a bizarre way of meeting someone and now here we are engaged.'","Instructor Stuart Black enlisted the help of a farmer friend to plough proposal in 25-foot long letters .

Alone: Vasily Makeyev, 13, was found naked and almost blind in the barn, located in the Chernyavsky district of Russia's Belgorod region. Police believe his parents made him live alone with their cattle . Neighbours said they often heard 'howls' and 'plaintive cries' from the building at night but did not know of the boy's existence. The child was barely able to speak and was mentally impaired, according to local reports. Police said Vasily's parents Andrey, 44, and Maria, 41, made him live alone with their cattle. Conditions in the barn were so cold during harsh Russian winters that the child was forced to hug calves to keep warm, it was reported.

A life cut short: Hannah Timings was on a backpacking tour of New Zealand when she went missing. Police believe they have found her body in the wreck of a helicopter, eight years after she went missing . A body has been found in New Zealand, believed to be Hannah Timings from Toddington, Gloucestershire, who vanished eight years ago after a helicopter crash. Hannah, who was 28, was flying with her boyfriend Kiwi pilot Campbell Montgomerie, 27, when their helicopter went missing in 2004. It was thought the pair died in a crash, but their helicopter had not been found until now. A helicopter wreckage was discovered in Fiordland, a remote part of the country on the South Island, yesterday. Police say the helicopter is the same aircraft that went missing in 2004. Hannah Timings was a London-based project manager working for Viscount Linley's furniture business when she went to New Zealand on a six-month backpacking tour. She and Campbell set off on a . helicopter tour of New Zealand’s South Island peaks on January 3 2004. They were on a scenic trip from the alpine resort of Queenstown to the renowned beauty spot of Milford Sound. An hour after take-off she and Campbell flew into thick cloud and . radioed the local control tower for directions. Soon after all radio contact was suddenly lost and they were not heard of since. An extensive two-week search at the time of the crash failed to turn up any sign of the missing aircraft. The wreckage was spotted yesterday in rugged terrain at the edge of the original search area by another helicopter pilot. A specialist police team, including alpine cliff rescue members, recovered two bodies and were hoping to formally identify them by using DNA samples. A life cut short: Hannah Timings was on a backpacking tour of New Zealand when she went missing. Police believe they have found her body in the wreck of a helicopter, eight years after she went missing . They said Hannah's family had been told and officers hoped the discovery would bring them some closure. Inspector Olaf Jensen, of Invercargill, New Zealand said: 'The helicopter's wreckage is spread across a large area in rugged terrain. 'The weather in the area is good and the team is hoping to complete the scene examination.' Pilot Brendan Hiatt, from Glacier Southern Lakes Helicopters, said he was on the way back to Queenstown after picking up two American couples, when he spotted something below. He said: 'I just spotted something glinting that just didn't look quite right amongst the snow, so I said 'we'll just take a look'. 'It's happened before, where you see a glinting rock or something that you go in closer for a look at. We got close and it was pretty evident what it was.' At the time of the helicopter's . disappearance, rescuers spent 204 flying hours and 2,300 man hours . searching the mountainous area where the four-seater privately-owned . helicopter was lost. Bryan . Nicholson, a spokesman for the British High Commission in New Zealand, . said at the time that trying to find them really was like trying to find . 'a needle in a haystack'. In 2006 Hannah's family, who described her as 'an absolutely lovely and loving girl' who adored adventure and the outdoor life, won a battle for a £10,000 life insurance policy payout from Columbus. Hannah's father Phil said the money had been divided between her brother Sam and sister Layla.","Hannah Timings vanished eight years ago on a backpacking trip around New Zealand .

Paramotorer Scott Little found himself entangled 32ft up a tree and had to be rescued by more than 40 emergency workers in a two-hour operation . Daredevil: Little, 24, seen just before his collision with a tree. He had been taking advantage of good weather conditions to go paramotoring, a sport similar to paragliding . Rescue: Little, from Yeovil, came into difficulty at Ham Hill in Somerset when strong crosswinds sent him hurtling towards a copse of trees . Mr Little, who only took up the hobby earlier this year, remembered his training and tried to gain speed. But he clipped the top of the trees and was smacked in the face by a branch. Seconds later, he was entangled in the . foliage and was left dangling in the top of the tree before being . spotted by a dog walker. It took more than 40 emergency workers two hours to bring him down from the tree, at Ham Hill Country Park in Yeovil.

'I was two feet away from missing them. It happened so quickly. I found it quite amusing. 'I couldn't get a mobile signal up the tree at first but once I did I phoned my family who were together at the time. 'I told them I was surrounded by firemen and ambulances and I was stuck up a tree. 'They all laughed and didn't believe . me, and carried on with what they were doing. It wasn't until after 3pm . they called and wondered where I was.' Long way down!

The parents of an 11-year-old boy found hanging from a bunk-bed waited 40 minutes for an ambulance after a controller refused to interrupt the crew during their lunch break, an inquest heard yesterday. After Callum James was discovered in a bedroom by his mother Pauline she dialled 999 and a volunteer community first responder, who are trained to provide life-saving care prior to the arrival of an ambulance, reached the address within five minutes. At this point Callum still had a faint pulse but it was only when the ambulance arrived 35 minutes later that he could be placed on a spinal board and carried downstairs. Callum, who had been due to start secondary school the day after the incident, died 48 hours later in Sheffield Children’s Hospital. Blanche Lentz, of East Midlands Ambulance Service, told the inquest that the 999 call was received at 12.58pm on September 4, 2011. A minute later a paramedic car based in Scunthorpe, 15 miles from the James family home in Gainsborough, was dispatched as well as the volunteer, who lived closer. The ambulance controller identified four available vehicles, but all were more than 30 minutes away. The controller was not called to give evidence at the hearing in Lincoln yesterday. Lunch break: East Midlands ambulance crews took 40 minutes to reach Callum James, 11, after he was found hanged on a bed. An operator did not want to interrupt crews on their lunch break, an inquest was told . Miss Lentz told Central Lincolnshire . coroner Stuart Fisher she ‘cannot commit as to why none of these . ambulances were dispatched’. Eventually, four minutes after the 999 call, the controller requested a crew be sent from Retford, Nottinghamshire. But Miss Lentz said the crew were on . an ‘undisturbed meal break’ and it was ambulance service policy that ‘a . crew does not have to attend when they are on a meal break.’ She said the crew were not interrupted and were told of the call only 17 minutes later. They eventually arrived at 1.38pm. Tragedy: Callum James, who suffered from both autism and ADHD, died at Sheffield Children's Hospital (pictured) on September 6, 2011 . Delay: Despite Gainsborough (pictured) having its own ambulance station, crews were requested from Scunthorpe (15 miles away) and Retford (12 miles) Paramedic Andrew Devenport told the . inquest: ‘If we had been notified by control of this incident we would . have immediately made ourselves available and responded to the call.’ Mr Fisher recorded a verdict of . suicide on Callum, who suffered from both autism and Attention .

A spaniel that fell 164ft down a mine shaft while chasing a cat was finally found after a 24-hour search when his owner whistled into a microphone. Two-year-old Iso tumbled 50m into the empty mine while out with his owner Brian Saunders. Mr Saunders was playing a round of golf when the dog spotted a cat and ran into undergrowth at the course in Redruth, Cornwall. Iso fell into a mine shaft, but . apparently survived the fall after landing on garden waste . thrown in by a local resident. The . pooch is trained to return to a whistle and despite a frantic search he . could not be found and a distressed Brian returned home to Falmouth, . Cornwall. But the . following morning he got a call from the owners of a house near the . course who thought Iso might have fallen down a mine shaft in their . garden. Brian raced to the house to find a 'small army' of firefighters at work who asked him to whistle into a microphone. The sound blared out from speakers lowered into the seam which echoed around the mineshaft. Iso recognised his owner’s whistle and began barking which allowed rescuers to pull him out unscathed. Mr Saunders said: 'They put a probe down the shaft and a chap with headphones asked me to whistle into a microphone. 'I whistled twice and nothing happened, and then after the third whistle, the chap said he could hear barking.' Terrifying fall: The spaniel tumbled 50m into the empty mine while out with Mr Saunders on a golf course . It took the firefighters around an hour to set up their equipment before one of them abseiled to the bottom of the shaft. Iso, who seemed none the worse for wear, was hauled to the surface and reunited with his owner. Brian . said: 'Iso was jumping for joy when he saw me. He was jumping up and . licking my face.

Losing hope: Despite a frantic search, Iso could not be found and distressed Mr Saunders returned home . 'They were absolutely fantastic. Iso . suffered a cut on the top of his head, a gravel abrasion on his side and . a bruise on his muzzle. 'The vet couldn’t believe his injuries were so minor after such a fall. 'The . firefighter who went down the shaft said it was very spongy at the . bottom, so it may be that someone had thrown garden waste down the . shaft, which saved Iso’s life.' Safe and sound: Iso back home with Mr Saunders. The vet couldn't believe the dog had suffered such minor injuries after a fall of that height .

A computer hacking gang caused major companies like PayPal and Visa multi-million pound losses with a series of cyber attacks, a court heard. Four members of cyber group Anonymous targeted famous firms with a string of coordinated attacks, causing chaos by flooding them with messages and requests, it is alleged. They are said to have used a Russian-based service provider to carry out the attacks, which permitted 'anything, even CP, child . pornography’, Southwark Crown Court heard. Accused: Ashley Rhodes . Accused: Peter Gibson . Christopher Weatherhead . Under the banner Operation Payback, Anonymous are accused of targeting companies who opposed internet piracy . but later attacked PayPal after it refused to process WikiLeaks . payments. Their actions caused losses totaling £3.5 million at PayPal, while sites belonging to Mastercard and recording industry bodies were also forced offline. Prosecutor Samit Patel said the case showed the 'dark side of the internet'. Anyone who tried to visit the sites was directed to a webpage displaying the message ‘You’ve tried to bite the Anonymous hand. You angered the hive and now you are being stung’. Four men accused of launching cyber attacks against major companies are said to have targeted PayPal after it refused to process payments from Julian Assange's Wikileaks. Christopher Weatherhead, 22, of Holly Road, Northampton, is on trial accused of playing an ‘integral role’ in the attacks, while Ashley Rhodes, 28, of Bolton Crescent, Camberwell, south London, Peter Gibson, 24, of Castletown Road, Hartlepool, and an 18-year-old, who cannot be named, have already admitted their roles in the conspiracy. Jurors heard Weatherhead, who used the online handle ‘Nerdo’, told others ‘I think we should do something really bad’ in the run-up to the hacking campaign. ‘This case, simply put, is about hackers who used the internet to attack and disable computer systems, colloquially described as cyber-attackers or vandals,’ said Mr Patel. ‘It is the prosecution case Christopher Weatherhead, the defendant, is a cyber-attacker, and that he, and others like him, waged a sophisticated and orchestrated campaign of online attacks that paralysed a series of targeted computer systems belonging to companies, to which they took issue with for whatever reason, that caused unprecedented harm.' The Northampton University student and his three co-conspirators carried out distributed denial of services attacks (DDoS) against the companies, he added. DDoS attacks work cripples computer systems by flooding them with an ‘intolerable number of online requests and messages'. A gang alleged to have launched cyber attacks against record labels are also said to have discussed infecting the website of pop star Lily Allen . ‘The members of Anonymous describe themselves as hacktivists, it’s a sort of play on words,’ said Mr Patel. ‘They conducted online attacks against computer systems which they took the view, for whatever reason, needed to be dealt with, taught a lesson. ‘Their method was to carry out DDoS attacks in order to bring them down.’ Mr Patel said the gang believed everything on the internet should be free with no copyright protection. The court heard PayPal was attacked after it decided not to process payments on behalf of the Wau Holland Foundation, an organisation involved in raising funds for WikiLeaks. He suggested they should 'reap”, thought to mean 'rape', Paypal, using a free internet tool called Low Orbit Ion Canon (LOIC) as a ‘destructive cyber weapon’, it is claimed. Mr Patel said: ‘Once downloaded the LOIC could be used to attack by sending internet traffic to a target computer. ‘When the volume of traffic sent to a computer becomes too much for it to handle it would suffer a denial of service. Companies PayPal and Ministry of Sound were among those targeted by an alleged gang of cyber hackers . ‘The more LOICs used, therefore, to attack a target computer, the more likely that a denial of service will take place.’ He said the LOIC was used in connection with an online chat system, called AnonOps, to allow Weatherhead and other hackers to order several computers or ‘bots’ to attack simultaneously. Mr Patel said the attack on PayPal took place between December 8 and 17 and it took more than 100 staff, from its parent company eBay, had to repair it. Record firm The BPI was targeted on September 19 and 20 2010, leading it to have to pay out £3,996 for online security in the aftermath, plus hundreds of pounds in other costs. The court heard the four websites run by the Ministry of Sound that were targeted in early October 2010 cost the company about £9,000, while it is alleged the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) was attacked between September 19 and 20, 2010, though the DDoS did not shut the site down. The financial cost to the IFPI was even greater, with more than £20,000 lost as its website was down for nine days after hacked in November 2010. Weatherhead allegedly bought a website - anonops.net - for Anonymous to use from a Russian based service provider he claimed to know ‘permitted anything, even CP, child pornography’. Police swooped on Weatherhead's student home on January 27, and seized his computers, while the 18-year-old who cannot be named; Rhodes and Gibson were also held. Mr Patel said the 18-year stated online, Iin this network I'm the second most anon. Nerdo is the first', and described him as an administrator. Rhodes, known as NikonElite, also operated as an administrator. The prosecutor said: 'He was undoubtedly actively involved in Operation Payback.' Gibson, whose nickname was Peter, was involved in the administration and maintenance of an IRC server that was 'used as a forum for conspiratorial discussions for attacks which could and did take place'. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Christopher Weatherhead, 24, alleged to have masterminded attacks .

Two nurses who ignored the plight of an epileptic girl who died after she inhaled her own vomit in a hospital bed face being struck off. Lassania Aslam, 17, suffered five seizures in the space of 24 hours after being admitted to The Whittington Hospital in Archway, north London. But senior nurses Caroline O’Rourke and Mary Subaste failed to ensure she was looked after properly as the 17-year-old’s brain was starved of oxygen, a tribunal heard. Neglect: Nurses Mary Subaste, left, and Caroline O'Rourke, right, failed to properly care for epileptic teen Lassania Aslam. She suffered five seizures in the space of 24 hours and died after choking on her own vomit . Subaste had witnessed two of Lassania’s fits, one of which lasted for six minutes. Lassania died four days later, with hospital neglect contributing to her death in March 2007. They both face being struck off after the Nursing and Midwifery Council panel in central London found the nurses’ fitness to practice impaired by reason of misconduct. Panel chair Michael Cann said: ‘The failure to ensure neurological observations were undertaken and recorded was a breach of duty of care serious enough to constitute misconduct. ‘Every patient must always be monitored and observed, and these observations recorded. This requirement is so basic that every nurse should be aware of it. Tragic: Lassania Aslam had learning disabilities and was a life-long sufferer of epilepsy . ‘Not doing so makes it is impossible to accurately assess whether the condition of the patient is improving or deteriorating and make decisions on whether to call for medical intervention, which must be taken expeditiously. ‘The panel notes the coroner’s finding in this case that basic standards of practice for neurological observation were not followed. ‘While not attributing blame for the death, this observation serves to underline the potential risk to patients if standard observations are not undertaken.’ O’Rourke was in charge of the Medical Admissions Unit where Lassania, of Crouch End, north London, was taken after suffering two epileptic fits in Accident and Emergency. She failed to ensure neurological observations were carried out after Lassania suffered a seizure at 12.10pm, on March 26, 2007, and did so again after a fit the next morning at around 7.40am. Night shift nurse Subaste admitted failing to ensure observations were taken following three fits during the night. Lassania, who had learning disabilities and was a long-standing sufferer of epilepsy, was admitted to the hospital at 5am on March 26, 2007 with vomiting and fever. Both nurses have admitted they failed in the care that Lassania received in the days she before her death, on April 1. Failure: The Whittington Hospital in Archway, north London, where Lassania Aslam was taken in March 2007 . An inquest in March 2008 into Lassania’s death heard admissions from hospital staff that basic care had not been given. The 17-year-old had inhaled vomit after a seizure and had suffered irreversible brain damage. The hearing resumed this week after being adjourned in August. O’Rourke, who now works in a care home in Ireland, earlier told the hearing of her regret over the failures to properly care for Lassania. She said: ‘I would have, looking back in reflection, not stood over the nurses but been near enough to be confident the patient was being looked after. ‘I would make sure the observations had been done, not naively expect them to have been done.’ Asked what she would do differently if she was working that shift again, she replied: ‘Everything.’","Lassania Aslam, 17, suffered five epileptic fits in the space of 24 hours .

Thanksgiving tragedy: Waves break behind a dive boat that capsized off Hillsboro Inlet near Pompano, Beach, Florida, killing a 54-year-old female passenger . Terrifying: The victim, Nina Poppensdorf, was among 23 people aboard the Coral Princess who were launched into the water when the vessel was overturned during a driving trip . Poppelsdorf was in Florida with her nephew, who is from Pennsylvania, just for the dive trip. 'They just went on this fun trip together to just do dives,' said . sheriff’s office spokeswoman Dani Moscehlla. 'So this is especially . tragic that it was on Thanksgiving and it ended in tragedy.' Poppelsdorf was a senior manager of the radiation protection, . industrial hygiene and safety center at Sandia National Laboratories, . lab spokeswoman Heather Clark said. She was hired in Aug. 1992 at the . lab, a federal research and development center. 'Nina worked for about 20 years at Sandia National Laboratories and made . many contributions to industrial hygiene, safety and radiation . protection,' said Sandia Environment, Safety & Health director Sid . Gutierrez, her supervisor. Rescue: Fire department spokeswoman Sandra King said the boat was found 'in pieces and upside down' in the water . 'She served as both a staff member and later . as an outstanding manager. She was recently promoted to senior manager . and was well-respected by her peers and staff alike. Her contributions . to improving safety at Sandia are numerous and she will be missed as . both a member of the Sandia family and as a wonderful person.' Darrell Fong, a Sandia Labs safety engineering manager who worked . with Poppelsdorf, said she was admired for her professionalism and . easily identified by her laugh. “She had a great laugh. Everyone could recognize her laughter. They’d say ‘Oh, there’s Nina.’” Fong said. Poppelsdorf was a leader of a Sandia team that helped in the response . to the crisis at Japan’s Fukushima nuclear plant after the March 2011 . earthquake and tsunami left several reactors there without cooling . water, Fong said. He also said Poppelsdorf was a certified diving . instructor. Rescue crews found the 45-foot-long catamaran ‘in pieces, upside down in the water,’ The Orlando Sun Sentinel reported. Three other passengers were taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries and later released, ABC News affiliate WPLG-TV reported. Lifeguards used wave runners to start rescuing passengers trapped on top of the flipped over dive boat, identified as the Coral Princess and registered to South Florida Diving Headquarters. The tragic incident began unfolding shortly before 1pm when first responders received a report about a capsized catamaran. Lifeguards used water bikes to reach the vessel floating belly up and began scooping survivors out of the water. 'Chaos. Just people in the water. Just unbelievable,' one eyewitness said to ABC News. Private boat owner Greg Oars, who also took part in the rescue mission, said he witnessed lifeguards pulling Ms Poppelsdorf out of the water, and he knew at once that something was wrong because 'she came up limp.' Emergency personnel on the scene . attempted to revive the 54-year-old, who was in town visiting with a . nephew, but without success. She was taken to Broward Health North, . where she has died. The Broward County Medical Examiner will determine the cause of her death. Recovery: The capsized vessel is towed back into port following the tragedy . Surviving passengers began gathering on the beach to make sure everyone was accounted for. 'We kept hearing back and forth, just trying to get a head count on . everybody, and they were missing one,' eyewitness Greg Oars said. Three . other people who were injured in the incident were also hospitalized, . but have since been treated for cuts and bruises and released. Surviving . passengers told officials that they had been enjoying their diving . trip, which began at 9am that morning, and were about to return to shore . when a big wave suddenly overwhelmed their craft. Wind speeds in the area registered at 25 mph, gusting to 30 mph, and the water was choppy throughout the day, The Palm Beach Post reported. Eyewitness . Skip Morris, 58, said the wave's impact sent the passengers flying into . the water, adding that he believed the tragedy could have been avoided . if only the captain had waited for the breaking waves to settle before . trying to approach the dock. The . U.S. Coast Guard, however, has avoided ascribing blame to anyone for . now, only saying that the incident is under investigation. Speaking to the Sentinel, Nancy Verreaullt, whose husband and three children were on the vessel when it capsized described the incident as 'scary.' Her father Laurent Verreaullt, 71, told the newspaper that he had said goodbye to his son-in-law and three grandchildren early in the morning. 'It was supposed to be a four-hour diving trip and now people are hurt on Thanksgiving,' he said. I don't think the captain ever wanted that.' Conditions on the water were dicey, the seas running 5 to 7 feet with a . wind from the north at 20 to 28 mph, said Lisa Morgan, a Sea Tow . International dispatcher to the Orlando Sentinel. Survivors: Victims rescued by lifeguards from the flipped dive boat wait wrapped in towels and yellow tarps at the Hillsboro Inlet Marina . First aid: Besides Ms Poppensdorf, three other people were taken to a hospital to be treated for cuts and bruises . 'During the rescue, it got pretty dicey and scary because we were told there were more people. There may be people missing,' said Pompano Beach Fire Rescue spokesman Sandra King. Investigators worked through the night to question the survivors about . what happened in the moments before the wave hit the catamaran. 'The wave caught it from behind and it flipped as [the captain] was . coming in the harbor,' an unidentified passenger told ABC News. 'He was . trying to time it. He didn't time it right and then it just flipped.' The catamaran did not appear to be over capacity and investigators are not looking at professional misconduct by the dive company. 'Right now, it looks like this is a tragic accident,' Broward Sheriff's . Office spokeswoman Dani Moschella said. 'What started out as a gorgeous . day on the water for 23 people ended in tragedy.' Sheriff's deputies identified the captain of the dive boat – owned by . South Florida Diving Headquarters of Pompano Beach – as Dennis . Winchester, 53.

It was the iconic image that marked the start of some of Britain's classic 20th century movies including the Carry On films, The Red Shoes and A Matter Of Life And Death. A bare-chested man striking a gong introduced Rank Organisation films right up until the company stopped making them in the 1990s. Now, the firm - which currently runs bingo clubs and casinos - has brought back the Gongman for the 21st century with a nationwide competition to celebrate its 75th anniversary. And in a nod to girl power, there's also a Gongwoman. Scroll down for video . A 'Gongman' for the 21st century: Chris Rowley from Stoke - winner of a nationwide competition - recreates the Rank Organisation's Gongman pose at London's Grosvenor G Casino yesterday to celebrate the group's 75th birthday . Spot the difference: This shot of one of the original Gongman, boxer Billy Wells, marked the start of hundreds of Rank films. He and others mimed hitting the gong, which was actually made of plaster or papier-mache . Two contestants, including an actress from London, beat nearly 1,000 others to be named the new Rank Gongwoman and Gongman. Kate Holderness, 28, an actress originally from Preston but now living in London, and semi-professional rugby player Chris Rowley, 25, from Stoke, were the national winners of a search launched in August for someone to revive the role. They recreated the famous pose seen in the opening credits of hundreds of movies produced and distributed . by the company over more than 50 years. A gong for the girls: Kate Holderness from Finchley, north London, won the Freestyle category of The Rank Group's competition to search for a new Gongman and Gongwoman . A new era: Chris Rowley beat 1,000 other contestants to become the new Gongman . The famous 'Gongman' preceded the opening credits of every movie produced by The Rank Organisation founded by J. Arthur Rank (pictured below) in 1937. By 1942, Rank owned more than 600 cinemas and numerous film studios across the country. In 1945 it set up the Rank Organisation acting school that launched several acting careers such as Christopher Lee, Diana Dors and Dirk Bogarde. Throughout the 1940s and 50s, it produced some of Britain's most memorable films with world class directors such as Laurence Olivier, Emeric Pressburger and David Lean. Some of the firm's best known films include To Paris With Love, The Thirty-Nine Steps, The Red Shoes (right) and A Matter Of Life And Death. The company also branched out into comedy and produced the 'Carry On...' films. After J. Arthur stepped down as managing director in 1952, Rank continued to diversify its portfolio into other industries such as the manufacture of radios, TVs and photocopiers under the management of Sir John Davis.. In 1996 the company name and some of the remaining assets were taken over by gaming company The Rank Group Plc. Kicking off celebrations at London’s . Grosvenor G Casino, Mr Rowley took up the soft-headed stick to . ‘strike’ the gong, a role previously held by wrestler Ken Richmond and . boxer Billy Wells. Back then, they just mimed striking the gong, which was made of plaster of papier-mache. However, Mr Rowley won the honour of . hitting the real thing - albeit a much smaller instrument, held up by a cast iron support. The original images were shrouded in . shadow, protecting the modesty of the Gongman, and . probably to hide the fact that it was actually fake. Rowley on the other hand was shot in . full daylight, grinning at the camera in a way that suggests he is . perfectly comfortable in his tight boxer shorts. And rather than behind closed studio doors, he stripped off in public, posing on a London high street in front of a shop door. Ms Holderness, who has appeared in Emmerdale and Heartbeat, submitted a video of herself taking part in 'extreme gonging' in the 'freestyle' category. She produced a spoof mini documentary of her apparently 'gonging' the London Eye and Big Ben's clock face at night. She said: 'I had such a lot of fun making the film and am very excited, and surprised, to have won. 'I really look forward to doing extreme gonging in Vegas.' Rowley, an insolvency administrator who plays for Stoke Rugby Club, won the 'classic' category after entering through a 'gonging' themed night at his local Grosvenor casino. He said: 'I was surprised to be in the top 75, let alone win the classic category. 'I genuinely thought someone was winding me up when they told me I'd won as I only entered for a bit of fun. 'I'm really chuffed and look forward to helping launch the Rank Gongman social media brand and launching Grosvenor G Casino Reading.' Both winners have been given a holiday for two to Las Vegas with $1,000 (£625) spending money.

Only one in eight of the couples and individuals who try to adopt children are approved by social workers, official figures revealed yesterday. The shocking statistics mean that more than 22,000 would-be adoptive parents vanish from the system every year. The figures were made public for the first time by the schools and children inspectorate Ofsted. They were released just three weeks after the government-sponsored National Adoption Week called for thousands more people to come forward to adopt. Barriers: Of the 25,380 couples and individuals who inquired about adopting in the year to March, just 3,048 were actually approved as prospective parents (file photo) The Ofsted count showed that in the year which ended in March, 25,380 couples and individuals made inquiries about adopting a child. Of these, only 4,145 (16 per cent) went on to make applications to adopt a child. Even fewer - 3,048 - were actually approved as prospective parents by council or agency social workers. 'We are not being told why people are being turned down or put off' Adoption researcher Patricia Morgan . The drop-out rate has been revealed at a time when ministers have promised to sweep away the barriers to adoption put up by social workers over the past three decades. Parents have been regularly turned down because social workers insist on precise racial matches, and white parents are routinely rejected as adopters of black or Asian children. Potential parents are also turned down because they smoke, or are too old, or social workers say their health is not good enough. The Ofsted breakdown, based on returns from councils and  voluntary adoption agencies, gave the same figure as Whitehall for the number of children adopted from the care system last year – 3,450. Refused: Many would-be parents have been turned down because social workers insist on precise racial matches (file photo) About 65,000 children live in state care, either in children’s homes or with frequently changing foster families. Children who grow up in care are likely to grow up with poor education and have a high chance of falling into drug abuse, crime or early pregnancy. Despite regular warnings that adoption placements often break up, the Ofsted figures showed that there were only 115 ‘unplanned endings’ of adoption placements during the year. The disappearance of the great majority of people who hoped to adopt a child provoked demands for explanations yesterday. Adoption researcher Patricia Morgan said: ‘How are you going to recruit people to adopt children if nobody knows why people are dropping out? ‘We are not being told whether people are being turned down or put off. We do not know what criteria are used to approve or reject people. We do not know to what extent the decisions are made on grounds of race, age, health or people’s opinions. We need to know.’ A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We are making the adoption system as welcoming and helpful as possible so that those who want to adopt are supported and encouraged. ‘We are setting up a new national information service, called a gateway, for prospective adopters. ‘With a website and helpline from early next year, it will give a consistent service across the country. 'The Government is reforming adoption to make the process swifter and place children in care with loving families.’ Ministers have promised to sweep away barriers to adoptive parents over recent months, and in particular they have said race rules will go. The barriers to adoption have helped push down the number of children who find new families from 20,000 a year in the 1970s to few more than 3,000 now. The Ofsted figures showed that 92 per cent of people approved to adopt were white, while 78 per cent of children in care and 85 per cent of children who are adopted are white. Anyone who hopes to adopt a child must go through a lengthy process. The first step is to contact the council or an adoption agency. Couples or individuals are then sent an information pack with material about how the process works and children up for adoption. Would-be parents then go on a preparation course to ‘give an insight into what adoption means today’, followed by a home visit by a social worker. The worker will ‘discuss and explore why you want to adopt, the kind of child you would best be able to care for, and your overall suitability. References will be sought and checks made’. An adoption panel considers the social worker’s report, and once adoptive parents are approved, they are linked with a child. Adoptive parents are given details about the child’s  background before meeting him or her. If all goes well, the child moves in with the new parents and a court gives legal approval to the adoption.","Figures reveal just one of every eight couples or individuals who try to adopt are approved by social workers .

It is only day one of seven at China's Communist Party Congress in Beijing, but already this delegate was struggling to stay awake. He was caught on camera letting out a wide yawn as outgoing President Hu Jintao gave a mammoth 100-minute speech to open the event, which marks the country's once-a-decade leadership transition. Perhaps he'd be advised to order a refill of the coffee in front of him if he's to make it through the next six days of the 18th Congress at the Great Hall of the People. And it wasn't as though his departing leader's speech was too dull, as Mr Hu warned that rampant corruption in the Communist Party could topple the regime. Mr Hu said: ‘If we fail to handle this issue well, it could prove fatal to the party, and even cause the collapse of the party and the fall of the state.’ Stay awake! A delegate lets out a gaping yawn during the 100-minute speech by outgoing President Hu Jintao that opened the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party . More coffee?

Mr Hu added senior officials should . strengthen ‘supervision over their families and their staff, and they . should never seek any privilege’. His warning comes after revelations . that the close family of outgoing premier Wen Jiabao was exposed as . having amassed around £2billion in ‘hidden riches’. And on the eve of the congress, . high-ranking politician Bo Xilai was formally expelled from the party, . following the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood by Bo’s wife Gu . Kailai last November. The Bo scandal has overshadowed the handover of power and exposed infighting and horse trading among hard-liners and reformers. At the congress, Mr Hu promised political reform – but he ruled out copying Western-style democracy. He also said army generals must . transform ‘China into a maritime power’ to ensure it could ‘win a local . war in the information age’ to defend its territorial claims in the . resource-rich seas off its coast.

In a speech aimed at outlining the successes of the past five years and challenges for the future, Mr . Hu said: 'We are faced with unprecedented opportunities for . developments as well as risks. The party must keep in mind the trust of . the people. 'The fight against corruption remains a serious challenge for us.' Coming so soon after President Barack .

A row has broken out between two of Britain’s most historic cathedral cities after one accused the other of trying to 'steal' its Christmas shoppers. Traders in Salisbury, Wiltshire, were left seething when a billboard went up in the city centre advertising a festive market in Winchester, Hampshire, 30 miles away. They feared the poster - which described Winchester as 'England’s Christmas Capital' - would draw away valuable business. Riled: Traders in Salisbury were left fuming when this poster for a Christmas market in neighbouring town Winchester appeared on their doorstep . Payback: Salisbury traders retaliated by erecting a poster for their own festive market by Winchester's railway station . Now they have hit back with their own market and poster - and placed it in view of thousands of commuters near Winchester’s railway station. Salisbury hopes to attract some of the 400,000 people that spend around £1.5 million at the German-style market in Winchester each year. The event - in the former capital of England - has been running in the picturesque grounds of Winchester Cathedral for six years. An open air ice rink, live music, and wooden chalets selling a range of food and handmade gifts are said to boost sales in nearby shops by 25 per cent. Lucrative: The Christmas market at Winchester pulls in 400,000 people a year and is said to be worth at least £1.5million to the local economy . Ian Newman, chairman of Salisbury City Centre Management, hopes Salisbury’s new Christmas market will help claw back some customers. He said: 'A lot of traders in Salisbury were angry when Winchester tried to steal our customers by placing an advert in our city centre. 'They first did it last year and have done so again this year. In the current economic climate every customer is crucial and we cannot afford to lose them to other cities. 'We have wanted a Christmas market in Salisbury for many years and Winchester’s poster spurred us on to launch one this year. 'As part of our marketing we have placed a billboard poster in Winchester and are now taking them on - on their own turf.' Rivalry: Salisbury traders say Winchester Christmas market is stealing their business . Charlotte Barnaville, from Winchester Christmas Market, welcomed the competition. She said: 'The advert in Salisbury formed part of our wider marketing campaign and was not targeted specifically at them. 'We just want people to be aware of our event and are not trying to ‘steal’ customers. 'However, our poster does seem to have spurred them on and it is nice to have a bit of friendly competition between two great historic cities.' She added: 'We are not overly concerned by their efforts because we are confident we still offer the best market and Christmas entertainment in England.'","Traders in Salisbury, Wiltshire, left fuming by billboard in their city centre advertising festive market in Winchester 30 miles away .

Lei Zhengfu, a district party chief . in the southwestern city of Chongqing, was fired after an investigation . by the party's discipline watchdog confirmed that it was he who appeared . in the video, the state-run Xinhua news agency said. The case highlights the influence of China's fast-growing blogging community, and the ruling Communist Party's increasing sensitivity to public anger over abuse of power, official impunity and corruption. Dismissed: Lei Zhengfu, (centre), was sacked by the Communist Party after a video of him having sex with his teenaged mistress were leaked on the internet . Screenshots from the sex video first appeared on Sina Corp's Weibo site on Tuesday. The agency reported on Thursday that Lei had told a reporter the video, shot in 2007, was a fake. The . party has stepped up its rhetoric against corruption, seeking to . counter anger from citizens over regular reports of graft and debauchery . among officials - but efforts to root out the problem are reported to . have been ineffective. China was hit recently by controversy over the murder of Neil Heywood by Gu Kailai, wife of former Chongqing communist party chief Bo Xilai. Bo, whose expulsion from the party overshadowed last week’s leadership transition, has been accused of engaging in ‘improper sexual relations with multiple women’, and other crimes. Bo, who also faces possible charges of corruption and abuse of power, has yet to stand trial. Net-savvy people in China have found a . potent weapon for fighting official corruption and abuse of power in . microblogs like Weibo, which is similar to social networking sites Twitter and Facebook, and has had more than 420 million users at the end . of the third quarter this year. In September, another official, Yang . Dacai, lost his job in the northwestern province of Shaanxi after . Internet users compiled photos of him wearing several luxury watches . that he was unlikely to be able to afford on a civil servant's salary. A . month later, an urban management official in the southern province of . Guangdong, Cai Bin, was sacked after online postings about him owning 22 . homes. Lei's sacking was among the most talked about topics on the hugely popular Weibo site on Friday. Revealed: Screenshots from the video showed Mr Zhengfu, the party boss of Chongqing's Beibei District, having sex with his mistress . Disciplined: The Communist Party held an internal investigation into the video after it was first posted . Bloggers: The sacking reveals the Chinese Government's growing sensitivity to public anger over perceived abuses of power in public office . The Chinese term for mistress — ;ernai,; or second wife — is thought to go back to the polygamous tradition that developed amongst some of the country's ruling elite during the country's imperial period. Keeping a mistress is still viewed as a status symbol among some senior Chinese government officials and wealthy businessmen as has been revealed by recent scandals - including that of Lei Zhengfu. Some Government ministers have been revealed to have had multiple mistresses. One former minister is believed to have had as many as 18 mistresses, according to the New York Times. The women involved are often bought lavish gifts by their lover, from jewellery to luxury apartments and sports cars. The issue has, however, led to a growing public backlash, as stories of the excesses involved have beaten the state's censors to been leaked onto the internet.","Lei Zhengfu pictured naked with young woman in graphic video on web .

A name-dropping carpenter charmed a solicitor's wife out of thousands of pounds during their affair by claiming he lived next door to Johnny Depp and went on shooting jaunts with Eric Clapton. Victor Knight was a penniless . carpenter but posed as a businessman from a wealthy family who was about . to inherit a £17 million fortune. He wrecked the marriage of solicitor’s wife Jane Hadley-Piggin, who fell for his string of lies about his wealth and background and took out a £25,000 loan to invest in his business. False friends: Victor Knight had an affair with Jane Hadley-Piggin telling her he lived next door to actor Johnny Depp, left, and went shooting with guitar legend Eric Clapton, right . Knight claimed to go shooting with Eric Clapton and to have a mansion next to Johnny Depp’s multimillion-pound home in the West Country. He told 49-year-old Mrs Hadley-Piggin his mother owned a large estate in Gloucestershire and villas in the Algarve and Florida where she spent the winter months, but it was all lies. Mrs Hadley-Piggin’s marriage broke up after she started an affair with the smooth-talking conman who even fooled her parents and promised a lavish wedding before the money dried up and his lies were exposed. In reality he was a bungling cabinet maker from Bampton in North Devon who was also ripping off customers who hired him to do building work, Exeter Crown Court was told. He took on a major project to build a . new studio office for a business near Honiton but left owners Hugo and . Michaela Montgomery-Swan with huge bills after bungling the scheme and . lying about having the materials in stock. When police arrested him they found an instruction manual entitled How to Build a Barn in his van. Knight, . 61, who was based at Kersdown Barn, Bampton, Devon, but is now of . Chipstable, near Taunton, Somerset, admitted four offences of fraud and . was jailed for 32 weeks by Judge Erik Salomonsen. He . told him: 'When you began your relationship with Mrs Hadley-Piggin you . told lie after lie after lie and the consequence of that is the charge . which you have admitted, but it was the tip of the iceberg. 'She took out a loan which she could not afford and according to your basis of plea you enjoyed the benefit of £10,000 of that. All lies: He told 49-year-old Ms Hadley-Piggin's his mother owned a large estate in Gloucestershire and villas in Florida and on Portugal's Algarve coast, pictured, where she spent the winter months . 'This was not a single fraud. Your . offending involved false representations to Mrs Hadley Piggin and the . Mrs Montgomery-Swan. Only a custodial sentence is justified given the . nature and extent of your offending.' Mr . Joss Ticehurst, prosecuting, said the offences all date back to 2008 to . 2009 when Knight told lies during his personal relationship with Mrs Hadley-Piggin and his business dealings with the Montgomery-Swans. He met Mrs Hadley-Piggin when he worked at her home and started an affair with her at a time when her marriage was under stress. He . said: 'She succumbed to his charms. He described himself as a man from a . privileged background. He said his mother was exceedingly wealthy with . properties around the world and a large estate in Gloucestershire. 'He . said he had a £10,000 a month allowance and was ultimately worth more . than £10 million and she fell for it. These claims were a refrain which . he used on other people including the Montgomery-Swans. Justice: Knight, 61, admitted four counts of fraud and was jailed for 32 weeks by Judge Erik Salomonsen at Exeter Crown Court . 'Jane fell under his spell and they became romantically involved and was generous towards him, giving access to her credit cards, thinking he would repay them.' Mr Ticehurst said he got her to take out a £25,000 loan by telling her he needed the money to complete a barn conversion in Sherborne St John, Hampshire, which he would sell for £350,000 and thus enable them to marry and set up home together. She has ended repaying £27,272 and although he says he only received £10,000 the rest went to repay other debts he ran up while he was with her. He said he swindled publisher Hugo Montgomery-Swan and his wife Michaela by getting them to pay money up front for £10,000 worth of oak he claimed to have in stock but which did not exist. The couple were building a barn-style office at their home at Dulford, near Honiton, and he claimed to be able to handle the project but police found an instruction manual in his car. Mr Rupert Taylor, defending, said Knight now accepts he has done wrong and has a complete change of heart since the offences happened. He said: 'He told lies about his financial background while he was falling in love with someone and he became completely out of his depth. 'He did not pre plan this as a confidence trick. He is someone who gradually became embroiled and got into difficulties.' After the case Mrs Hadley-Piggin, who lived Uplowman at the time but has since moved to Witheridge, said: 'I am delighted with the result. It is a relief and brings some closure. He may be called Knight but he is no knight in shining armour. 'The past three years have been a living nightmare which has had a terrible effect on me, my marriage and our children. 'It has cost me four times as much as the £10,000 they mentioned in court. I was left with debts on phone contracts and credit card bills. 'He told so many lies. He said he went shooting with Eric Clapton and had a house next to Johnny Depp and was worth £17 million. I am glad he has faced justice at last.'

Sally Bercow and Alan Davies are two of 20 'high-profile' tweeters being targeted by Lord McAlpine for damages, it emerged today. The Tory peer has accused them of linking him to sex abuse at a north Wales children's home and then spreading the malicious rumour online after a botched Newsnight investigation. Speaker's wife Bercow, comedian Davies and Guardian columnist George Menbiot are on McAlpine's list of 20, his spokesman confirmed, because the former Tory treasurer believes they helped destroy his reputation. Pursued: Alan Davies (left) and Sally Bercow (right) are two of 20 'high-profile' tweeters being pursued for damages by Lord McAlpine . Battles: Many have apologised to the Tory peer but his legal team has said that people have destroyed his reputation . They are currently using someone with more than 500 Twitter followers as meeting their 'high profile' definition, the spokesman added. In total the . peer’s lawyers have identified 1,000 ‘original’ tweets and a further . 9,000 retweets, which is when a user re-posts a comment sent to them. They must apologise and agree to pay a nominal sum as requested to Children in Need, believed to be £5. McAlpine was accused after a shambolic BBC report led to his name being spread around the internet as a child abuser, which was completely untrue. Newsnight had not named him but referred to a senior . Conservative from the Thatcher era, leading to his identification . online. Mistake: Sally Bercow took to Twitter to comment on speculation as to the identity of the Tory at the centre of a Newsnight investigation and could be sued . I'm sorry: Mr Davies told his 444,000 followers on Twitter that he had written to Lord McAlpine to apologise . Mrs Bercow then wrote: ‘Why is . Lord McAlpine trending? *innocent face*.’ But she has defended her . tweet, describing it as not libellous - ‘just foolish’, has apologised and has now deleted her Twitter account. Jonathan Creek and QI star Davies had . tweeted: ‘Any clues as to who the Tory paedophile is?’ and then . retweeted a response naming Lord McAlpine. He then told his 444,000 followers this week: ‘I've just written to Lord McAlpine to apologise for retweeting . his name in relation to false allegations following a BBC . investigation.’ Meanwhile Monbiot tweeted: ""I looked up Lord . McAlpine on t'internet. It says the strangest things."" Monbiot later . apologised on his blog admitting his deep regret over what happened. But despite the apologies, they all appear to be being pursued and McAlpine's spokesman admitted the list could increase. McAlpine has already agreed a £185,000 deal . with the BBC and a £125,000 package with ITV after This Morning . presenter Phillip Schofield accidentally flashed a list of alleged . paedophiles to camera before handing it to the bemused Prime Minister. Andrew Reid, the peer's lawyer, reiterated yesterday they would look for damages from people who defamed his client on Twitter.

'I think most importantly we get an apology and an undertaking not to . repeat and once we've examined the extent of the damage they've done, . we'll agree suitable damages,' Mr Reid said.

"Sara McMeen, 30, committed suicide after killing her family last week . Her father Louis McMeen shot dead his first wife 40 years ago after spending time in a mental hospital . By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 14:29 EST, 22 December 2011 . A history of violence and mental illness exists in the family of a woman who shot her three children and boyfriend before turning the gun on herself. Sara McMeen, 30, shot her children Skyler Lemke, eight, Ian Lemke, seven and ten-month-old Maggie Warren in the back yard of their home in Emington, Illinois. The body of her partner, 29-year-old Daniel Warren, was found inside the home last Friday. It emerged today that McMeen's father shot his first wife dead more than 40 years ago in front of their two-year-old son. It happened before Sara McMeen was born. Scroll down for video . Looking forward to Christmas: Ian Lemke, seven and his eight-year-old sister Skyler were shot by their mother Sara McMeen while playing in the back yard of their home in Emignton, Illinois . A happier time: Sarah McMeen, right, and Daniel Warren, left, cuttle their newborn baby Maggie. All three are now dead along with McMeen's two children from a previous relationship . A jury found Louis McMeen not guilty . by reason of insanity in the 1971 killing of Pamela Bradley McMeen. Sheriff's . officials say they may never know Sara McMeen's state of mind before . the killings but the mother of Mr Warren said she had suffered from . bi-polar disorder. Authorities were waiting until the funerals of the family have taken place before questioning relatives and friends. The four victims will be buried . today. Daniel and Maggie Warren will be laid to rest in Morris, Illinois while the . funeral of McMeen's children from a previous relationship, Skyler and Ian, . will be held in Dwight. Devastation: Mourners watch as the casket of Sara McMeen leaves the memorial home in Dwight, Illinois - authorities believe she shot her boyfriend and three children before killing herself . Young family: Sara McMeen was said to have been suffering from bi-polar disorder but was not on any medication when she reportedly shot her ten-month old baby Maggie . Around 125 mourners attended the funeral of Sara McMeen in Dwight yesterday, saying that McMeen was a 'good person who lost her way', according to NBC Chicago. Pastor Roy Leve, who attended the . funeral, said: 'The McMeen family are very faithful in their desire to . love the Lord, and I'm just here to kind of support them in their loss.' The mother of Daniel Warren said she . saw McMeen just before the shooting and that she seemed happy, despite . not being on any medication for the mood disorder. Speaking to RadarOnline,Wendy Warren . said: 'Sara and my grandbaby came by to see me just the day before it . happened. She was happy and everything. She came to collect some clothes . that I had bought for baby Maggie.' Mourners: A congregation of around 125 attended the funeral of Sara McMeen who took her own life last week in Illinois after killing her own family . Laid to rest: A hearse carrying the young mother's body drives away from the funeral home in Dwight, Illinois . Grief: Mourners leave the funeral home yesterday after a service for Sara McMeen who was described as a 'good girl' who lost her way . The ten-month-old infant McMeen . shared with Mr Warren was shot at point-blank range in front of a . horrified neighbour at their home in the tiny farm town, after police . say she shot with Skylar Lemke, eight, and Ian Lemke, seven - from her . relationship with ex-boyfriend Brad Lemke. She then turned the gun on . herself. Around 40 years ago, Miss McMeen's . father Louis McMeen took his wife, from whom he had separated, to . secluded woods in Streator, Illinois and shot her before driving . to the police station with her body and his son on his lap. Mr McMeen had been released from a psychiatric ward a month earlier and was . returned to the custody of the state being unfit to stand trial, according . to the Chicago Tribune.There were no records of when he was released. He is now believed to be living in Dwight, according to the Pontiac . Daily Leader. Adored: McMeen cares for little Maggie right after she was born. It's unclear why the 30-year-old killed her family . Mrs Warren said Sara McMeen and her son had been dating on-and-off for five years. 'They had their issues and they’d . fight but they’d get back together,' Mrs Warren said. 'They had bought . rings but they weren’t married. They were working on their issues.' She said her son had several guns in the home. 'There were three children in the . house so he never kept the bullets the same place as the weapons and he . always had them locked up,' Mrs Warren told Radar. 'He had always wanted . to be a cop but was happy working in security.' Gruesome discovery: Daniel Warren was found inside the house while the bodies of the three children were lying in the back yard of the rented home . All killed: The young family had only moved to the tiny farming town of Emington six months ago . Brad Lemke earlier told the Chicago . Tribune he was at a loss to explain why the 30-year-old mother-of-three . might have annihilated her own family. 'I don't know, I have no idea,' he said. Neighbour Annelise Fiedler said she . heard gunshots on Friday afternoon and ran outside to see McMeen . wrapping her ten-month-old daughter Maggie in a blanket on the ground in . the family's backyard. Ms Fiedler, not realising what was happening, asked McMeen whether she was alright. McMeen responded: 'No, everything is not OK,' then bent down and shot the baby at point-blank range. Tragic end: The schoolchildren in the family were said to be excited as they got off the bus because school was out for Chirstmas . Ms Fiedler said she ran for help. When she returned McMeen was dead, having apparently turned the . semi-automatic pistol on herself. The gunshots Ms Fiedler heard were likely the sounds of McMeen gunning down Mr Warren and her son Ian inside the house. In the backyard, she killed Skyler before taking the life of her infant. Ms Fiedler said she had heard her . next door neighbours fighting at least three times since they moved in . this summer. But they otherwise kept to themselves. The two school children, on the other hand, were well-known in the town of 120 people. Neighbours reported seeing them playing in the backyard and nearby park often. McMeen's mother Cynthia, who is a . school bus driver in a town 12 miles north of Emington, issued a . statement asking for privacy as the family copes with the deaths: . 'The family grieves over the loss of . their loved ones. They realize this (tragic) incident affects not only . their family, but other families as well. The family is drawing together . during this time, relying on God, and grieving. They would ask for your . prayers for all the families involved and would like their privacy to . be honoured.' Skyler and Ian Lemke, the two older children, were seen getting off a school bus an hour before they were murdered. Tiny town: Emington, Illinois, is a farm down with a population of just 100. Residents say they have never seen anything like this before . 'They were happy because it was the last day of school before Christmas break,' neighbour Ronald Groetsema said. Neighbours reported seeing the school children playing in the backyard moments before they were gunned down. The family had moved to the town of . about 100 people about 80 miles southwest of Chicago this summer and the . two older children attend school in nearby Saunemin. Livingston County Sheriff Martin . Meredith said first responders found the bodies after Livingston County . dispatchers received a call on Friday afternoon. Ronald Groetsema lives near the home . where the family was found and said he heard six to eight gunshots, then . heard a second round of four to six shots a few minutes later. Mr Groetsema's 12-year-old son got off the school bus with the children who died, he said. Residents described Emington as a . once strictly farming town that has gone through changes in the last 20 . years as young families moved in. Young said the town has become more . of a bedroom community from which people commute north to cities such as . Joliet, about 45 miles away. 'We did have an awful disaster here,' said Emington Mayor Daniel Delaney, who's been in office for 24 years. 'You never would have thought it . would happen in our town of 100 people or less. It's very sad. There . were helicopters flying over earlier. Right now it's just very, very, . very sad for us here.' Mayor Delaney said the town is not prosperous and has received help from the state. 'It's always really had a hard time. Most of the people are retired or farmers who moved into town,' he said. Emington has a post office that's . been targeted for closure and just a handful of small businesses - a . grain elevator, a dog groomer and a small beauty salon. The town, Livingston County Board member Bob Young said, had never experienced anything like Friday's shootings. 'I've lived here all my life. I . guess, 60, 70 years ago we had a bank robbery, was the other big thing, . but otherwise, nothing like this,' he said. Young said he did not know the family well. 'We've seen the kids playing at the playground and talk to them,' Mr Young said. 'We thought everything was fine.' McMeen was one of nine children. Mrs Warren said she had spoken to McMeen's family, and that they were all consoling each other.

"Sales of some midi styles up as much as 168 per cent . Thirty-five per cent of women said they would wear a midi reaching to just below the kneed to their annual Christmas party . The retro look is inspired by Mad Men and celebrities like Victoria Beckham . By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 06:47 EST, 22 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:40 EST, 22 November 2012 . With Christmas party invites on the up and temperatures dropping, sales of longer, midi-length dresses are soaring. Fewer women are choosing thigh-revealing styles than ever before, as the trend towards longer hemlines continues. Sales of some midi styles are up as much as 168 per cent compared with November last year at high street store Debenhams. Even the girls from The Only Way Is Essex who are famous for their short hemlines, are opting for longer dresses . Bosses have carried out research among customers and predict that hemlines are set to fall further still, with celebrities like Victoria Beckham and Katie Holmes leading the style pack by sporting designs that finish between below the knee and the ankle. Even the more risque celebrities like Katie Price and the cast of ITV’s The Only Way Is Essex - who once insisted on mini skirts and dresses even in sub zero temperatures - have followed the new trend and are experimenting with the modest trend. A Debenhams spokesman said: 'We are entering an age of cover-up. Hemlines are plunging to below the knee as women go for a classier look inspired by TV shows such as Mad Men. 'British women are dressing for austerity, and that means skirts have become deadly serious - as women have a midi-moment.' Celebrities like Victoria Beckham and Katie Holmes are joining the rush for styles that finish between the calf and ankle . Pencil skirts, pleated skirts, and flared skirts, all of which are knee length or longer, have almost swept the mini skirt away for women in their mid 20s. The survey revealed that women now desire a longer, below-the-knee skirt to create a better, more professional impression at work, and also want something that can be worn on both formal and informal occasions - saving them money. And elegant, figure-hugging pencil skirts, inspired by 1950s fashion styles and television programmes such as Mad Men, are now the most popular design on the high street. Elegant, figure-hugging pencil skirts, inspired by 1950s fashion styles and television programmes such as Mad Men, are now the most popular design on the high street . With over half a million dresses sold in . the run-up to Christmas at Debenhams alone, mini styles are still . popular with teenagers and women in their early twenties. But once women reach 25, it seems they are choosing the more sophisticated, classic 'midi' look. Earlier research by the high street store showed that many women still wore short mini styles until they were 45-years-old. Celebrities like Elle McPherson and Sarah Jessica Parker are among older women who proudly showed off toned pins. The spokesman added: 'There is no doubt that we are seeing much less flesh being exposed on the average British high street. 'A glimpse of stocking has certainly become a thing of the past. 'However, we still believe that the mini skirt is simply too powerful a fashion icon to disappear entirely. 'They are still hugely popular - especially with our younger customer - and we fully expect hemlines to raise again in the near future.'

"By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 17:32 EST, 26 February 2012 . Billions of dollars are on the line . when a federal trial opens Monday over the reams of litigation spawned . by the nation's worst offshore oil disaster, though those whose losses . can't be repaid are hoping for something more elusive: justice for lost . loved ones. Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier is pushing back the federal trial over the nation's worst offshore oil disaster by a week, saying Sunday that BP PLC was making some progress in settlement talks with a committee overseeing scores of lawsuits, according to people close to the case. Two sources told the Associated Press that the judge said BP and the Plaintiffs' Steering Committee were 'making some progress' in their settlement talks. The steering committee is overseeing lawsuits filed by individuals and businesses in the wake of the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig on April 20, 2010, in the Gulf of Mexico. A grandmother's grief: Nelda Winslette, grandmother of Deepwater Horizon oil rig floorhand Adam Weise, is seen in 2010 holding a picture of her grandson, who was killed after his rig exploded . Engulfed in flame: Fire boat response crews sprayed water on the burning remnants of BP's Deepwater Horizon offshore oil rig after it exploded on April 20, 2010 . Sheryl Revette, whose husband, Dewey, . was among the 11 killed when BP PLC's Macondo well blew out and . triggered an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, doesn't . have anything to gain financially from the trial. She wants an apology from the oil giant, something she says she hasn't received yet. 'I've never heard a word from them,' said Ms Revette, 48, of State Line, Mississippi 'But an apology isn't going to bring my husband back.' Barring a last-minute settlement, U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier will preside over a three-phase trial that could last the better part of a year. Resigned: Former BP CEO Tony Hayward left his position after the disaster . The first phase is designed to identify the causes of the deadly blowout and to assign percentages of fault to the companies involved in the ill-fated drilling project. The trial may not yield major revelations about the causes of the disaster, but the outcome could bring much-needed relief for tens of thousands of people and businesses whose livelihoods were disrupted by the spill. The decisions and actions that led to the explosion and spill already have been painstakingly investigated by the Coast Guard, federal regulators and a presidential commission. Their probes concluded BP, rig owner Transocean Ltd. and cement contractor Halliburton Energy Services Inc. deserve to share the blame for a string of risky decisions that were designed to save time and money. Ms Revette, whose husband worked for Transocean, settled her claims against BP last year. But she and other family members plan to travel to New Orleans for the start of the trial, to make their presence felt. 'I feel like Dewey would want me to be there until the end, to see it through. That's who he was,' she said, recalling that her husband once prided himself on being the last worker to leave the rig at the end of a hitch. 'I've never heard a word from (BP). But an apology isn't . going to bring my husband back.' -Sheryl Revette . Ms Weise, 58, of Yorktown, Texas, . won't be attending the trial. She already has plenty of painful . reminders. Adam's birthday was in January. April . 20 will mark the two-year anniversary of the rig explosion. And her . son's absence will be sorely felt when his older sister gets married . this weekend. 'Going over there (to the trial) isn't going to change things one bit,' she said. 'My son is still gone.' The Deepwater Horizon was drilling in . water a mile deep the night of April 20, 2010, when an explosion and . fire rocked the rig. It burned for two days before sinking. An . estimated 206million gallons of oil spilled out of the BP-owned Macondo . well over several months, fouling sandy beaches and coastal marshes and . shutting vast areas of the Gulf of Mexico to fishing. Disaster: Technicians with a wildlife rehabilitation centre give a final rinse to a formerly heavily oiled brown pelican that was found in the area of the BP oil spill in June 2010 . From the beginning of the . disaster, many relatives of workers who died on the rig have felt that . their tragic losses were unjustly overshadowed by corporate . finger-pointing, legal wrangling, and concerns about the spill's . environmental and economic impact along the Gulf Coast. If no settlement is ultimately reached, there will be a three-phase trial that could last the better part of a year. The first . phase is designed to identify the causes of the deadly blowout and to assign . percentages of fault to the companies involved in the ill-fated drilling . project. Financial analysts estimate BP could wind up paying anywhere . from $15billion to $30billion over the lawsuits, and BP's chief executive . told a British newspaper that the company has set aside $40 million to deal . with fines and costs associated with the spill. An AP analysis found that the company could conceivably face . up to $52 billion in environmental fines and compensation if the judge . determines the company was grossly negligent. 'Nobody . cares about the 11 men who died,' said Arleen Weise, whose 24-year-old . son, Adam Weise, was killed in the blast. 'Did everybody have to forget . about those men?' Chris . Jones, whose brother, Gordon, died on the rig, is an attorney. So is . their father. Mr Jones, whose family plans to drive in from Baton Rouge . to attend the trial, said he trusts the court will ensure that the right . companies and individuals are 'taken to task' for their mistakes. 'Right . now, it is a bunch of finger-pointing, and nobody is taking . responsibility for anything,' said Mr Jones, whose 29-year-old brother . was a mud engineer for BP contractor M-I Swaco and is survived by a wife . and two young sons. Mr Jones said BP has blanketed the airwaves with ads touting the billions of dollars it already has spent on spill cleanup, yet the company hasn't had the 'common decency' to apologize to his family. 'Instead, they want everybody to think everything is fine,' Jones said. 'They want this to be about money and nothing else. It is going to be about money, but I don't think it's going to work out well for them.' A BP spokesman said the company has expressed its sympathies to the victims' families from the outset. In a press release less than a week after the explosion, former BP CEO Tony Hayward said: 'We owe a lot to everyone who works on offshore facilities around the world and no words can express the sorrow and pain when such a tragic incident happens.' The massive scope of the case - a maze of claims and counterclaims between the companies, federal and state governments and plaintiffs' attorneys - has elicited comparisons to the tobacco litigation of the 1990s. Historic case: BP will start one of the biggest fights in its 104-year history next week as the US Government sues the oil giant for the devastation caused by the Gulf of Mexico disaster . Remuneration: The case will in part decide how much BP has to pay for the disaster, which left marshes like this one in Port Sulphur, Louisiana coated with thick oil and made fishing virtually impossible . Roughly 340 plaintiffs' lawyers have worked on the case. BP has spent millions of dollars on experts and law firms. More than 300 depositions have been taken. Millions of pages of legal briefs have been filed. One Justice Department lawyer said it would take him 210 years to read all the pages submitted into the record if he read 1,000 pages a day. Barbier, a former president of the Louisiana Trial Lawyers Association and appointee of President Bill Clinton, has a reputation for speedy but fair trials. He will hear and decide the case without a jury. Each trial phase is expected to last two to three months, with breaks in between. Even if all parties settle their claims before or during the trial, it could take several months for claims to be paid. A payout can't come soon enough for Gulf Coast fishermen and oystermen. Mike Voisin, an owner of an oyster processing and sales business southwest of New Orleans, said few if any claims by oyster farmers have been resolved through the $20 billion compensation fund that BP created shortly after the spill. 'We need to get people back to work. It won't happen until this case gets out of the way,' he said. 'Playing the claims game and working with lawyers is not our profession, but it's what we've had to do.'","April 20, 2010 explosion of BP rig killed 11 and released some 206m gallons of oil polluted beaches, marshes, and made fishing on Gulf impossible .

Most of us are only just getting used to seeing a little sunshine after a soaking summer. But one pub has decided to skip Autumn and head for December by putting up its Christmas tree 110 days early. And The Wylde Green has already served its first festive meal. As many as 40 drinkers tucked into Christmas lunch on August 26. Jingle tills: The Wylde Green has put up its Christmas Tree to attract Christmas bookings. Lisa Evans is assistant manager at the business, in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham. The 39-year-old said: 'It's all to do with getting our bookings for Christmas, to be fair. We like to get it up early to explain what we have got going on and get as many bookings as we can. 'It's going all right at the moment, we have got quite a few.' Locals have been bemused by the addition to their bar. Some have told staff: 'It's way too early.' 'They think we are a bit mad to be honest. It is a bit early isn't it?' Lisa said. 'But all the Hungry Horse pubs should have their trees up, to be fair, to promote their Christmas bookings. 'I think most of the others will be putting theirs up shortly. We have to be first at everything.' Santa and his helper bring some festive cheer. Two months before Bonfire night . They wish it could be Christmas every day? Drinkers enjoy the sunshine. And piles of crackers adorn a display on one side of the pub. Kids have been pulling them. 'We did have a Christmas weekend a couple of weeks back,' Lisa said. 'We had a Santa in and we did Christmas dinners on the Sunday. 'That was Sunday, August 26. We did two for £10. 'It was turkey and all the trimmings, and all the Christmas diners were out. But we didn't dress the tables, we just did the promotion. It was basically to give customers a taste of what the Christmas dinners are like.' The pub is owned by the Greene King brewery. Spokesman Greg Gibbons said: 'We are 50 per cent full even now, so it’s a reminder to customers. 'People have become more wary of spending . money and they like to plan their spending ahead. The festive season is . not too far away - even though the weather outside is tremendous. 'When a customer realises it’s just four more pay days until Christmas it brings it home how close we are.' Morrisons stores have started stocking up for the festive season. At supermarket Morrisons, in Wokingham, in Berkshire, they have already started stacking the shelves with Christmas goodies. Branches of Tesco have already set up dedicated Christmas aisles across the nation. The . first reports of Christmas chocolate boxes on sale in Tesco came on the August 29 when pictures appeared on Twitter. Since then the Twitter-sphere has been filled with angry posts about premature holiday season advertisements. Clergyman Rod Lewis, a pastor in the Black Country, claimed the true meaning of Christmas had been hijacked by commercialism.He said: 'It . seems to get earlier each year and the emphasis has moved away from the . birth of Christ to people trying to make as much money as possible. 'The . true significance of Christmas has been lost.'People . want to cash in on the festival but it’s always been that way. However, .

Bad Santa: Gary Cooper has been given an ASBO to stop him recreating his 2011 Christmas grotto . A homeless man branded a 'Bad Santa' after he turned a bus shelter into a grotty Christmas grotto last year has been slapped with an ASBO to stop him doing it again. Police issued the mugshot of Gary Cooper, 50, after he was made subject of Anti-Social Behaviour Order to prevent him decorating the shelter near Penarth, South Wales. Council workmen tore down decorations in 2011 - and police have gone to court this . year to stop him putting them up again. Last year the Father Christmas . lookalike donned a Santa suit to greet passers-by and spent £30 of his . benefits to deck out the bus shelter with a tree, tinsel and stocking. But the grotto at Comeston bus stop was dismantled by council officials shortly before Christmas Day. Gary has branded council officials 'Scrooges' for banning him from celebrating the festive season in style again this year. The ex-jockey said: 'I’m just a . Christmas kind of guy. I’ve been homeless for the last few years and I . just wanted it to be perfect. 'Everybody thought it was a great attraction but the council said they were going to take my stuff unless I took it down. 'I think it’s ridiculous they’ve stopped me again, I’ve got no idea why I had to take my decorations down last year. 'They obviously have no festive spirit.' 'I'm just a Christmas kind of guy': Gary has branded council officials 'Scrooges' with no 'festive spirit' 'Elf 'n' safety' gone mad? Council workers removed Gary's possessions and decorations last December . The ASBO restricts Gary's behaviour in the run-up to Christmas in the Cardiff, Penarth and Barry areas of South Wales. A Christmas tipple is out of the question, as Gary will be in breach of his ASBO if he is found with an open alcoholic container in any public area. He is also banned from urinating in any public place or abusing any member of the public or a police officer.

"By . Rebecca Camber . UPDATED: . 02:24 EST, 26 July 2011 . To his neighbours in a quiet suburb of Cambridge, he was an ordinary computer programmer who enjoyed playing squash at the weekends. But yesterday friends of the man they knew as Cyril Macq were stunned after he was unmasked as Spain’s most wanted terror suspect – accused of attempting to assassinate the King of Spain with a grenade launcher. Eneko Gogeaskoetxea Arronategui, 44, was arrested in a dramatic early morning raid by armed police from Scotland Yard’s extradition unit and Cambridgeshire Police. 'Cyril Macq', circled, with fellow squash club members. He was arrested at his house in Cambridge . Neighbours in the Arbury area  woke . up to the sound of officers bursting into his modest three-bedroom . terraced house as helicopters hovered above the property where he has . been hiding for at least five years with his wife and their two . children. The alleged assassin from the Basque separatist group Eta is accused of plotting to assassinate Spain’s King Juan Carlos. During the botched grenade attack in . Bilbao in October 1997, a police officer was killed at the Guggenheim . Museum, after which Arronategui allegedly hijacked three cars to escape. Police allege that Eneko Gogeaskoetxea Arronategui, left, was part of an assassination attempt against King Juan Carlos in October 1997 . Yesterday it emerged that the . suspected terrorist, born in Guernica, had led an extraordinary double . life, pretending to be a French national on the  council estate in . Cambridge. Using the name Cyril Macq, he got a . job as an IT programmer for Webworks, which provides IT support to . online retailer Play.com in an industrial estate on the outskirts of the . city. He quickly made friends in the community and became a respected member of the Cambridge Squash Club. Shocked neighbours described the terror suspect as ‘quiet and polite’ and ‘a regular dad’. Police stand outside the Cambridge property that was raided yesterday following an 'intelligence-led' operation . The Spanish interior ministry said . police were tipped off to his Cambridge address after a Spanish national . spotted him at a sports club nearby. Yesterday Arronategui appeared before City of Westminster magistrates. He refused to agree to being extradited to Spain and was remanded in custody until the next hearing on July 25. Yesterday Steve Casey, chairman of the Cambridge Squash Club said: ‘Cyril has been the membership secretary at our squash club for seven years. He's a great guy and a great secretary at the club. ‘I'm blown away by the news - I'm really staggered.' Treasurer of the club, Bernie Yates, 61, added: ‘He is a very amiable chap and very popular within the club. We are all absolutely gobsmacked by the news.’ Mr Arronategi is alleged to have been involved in a plot to bomb the Guggenheim museum in Bilbao in October 1997 as Juan Carlos opened it, before fleeing the country . Arronategui faces further charges of possession of ammunition, three charges for theft of vehicles and one of forgery. During the botched assassination attempt, a police officer was killed in the Guggenheim Gardens, after which Arronategui allegedly hijacked three cars to escape. The plot was foiled when police asked two men disguised as gardeners to identify themselves. James Stansfeld, for the extradition authorities said: 'The requested person was stopped while he was in the Guggenheim gardens filling window boxes with ammunition and grenade launchers’. 'To effect his escape the officer who stopped him was shot and killed. 'In order to effect his escape throughout the city, he hijacked three cars to evade capture.' Mr Stansfeld added: ‘His involvement with the Eta terrorist organisation, which is an established terrorist organisation, could provide him with the means and indeed contacts to hide from the authorities in this jurisdiction and not cooperate with proceedings.’","Suspect, believed to be a member of terrorist group Eta, alleged to have also murdered policeman in Spain .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 21:26 EST, 13 October 2011 . Jailed: Rahman, pictured outside Leicester Crown Court, sold fake fine art to the tune of £180,000 . A rogue art dealer who conned galleries across Britain with fine art fakes worth £180,000 has been jailed. Rizvan . Rahman sold more than 30 forgeries in an elaborate scam which saw him . pass off paintings purportedly by world famous artists including . matchstick men painter LS Lowrie. He sold one Lowrie rip-off for £35,000 and 13 paintings imitating work by Mary Fedden, one of Britain's greatest living artists. Raham, 40, told galleries that he had been given the paintings by his father or had bought them for his private collection, Leicester Crown Court heard today. The court was also told that when they were uncovered as fakes he would feign surprise and refund the gallery. However even after refunds had been taken into account the teacher-turned-fake-dealer was more than £60,000 better off. Police raided the once respected art teacher's home and third floor studio in the leafy suburb of Stoneygate, Leicester, in December 2009 and seized 19 paintings from a collection of 168. Gordon Aspden, prosecuting, said: 'Between January 2008 and October . 2009, Rahman defrauded galleries and members of the public by selling . paintings he falsely claimed were genuine and original works of art. 'His motive was to make money at the expense of innocent purchasers and the amount involved was £179,450. 'When some of the frauds were discovered he would express surprise and refund the gallery involved. 'Taking refunds into account his net profit was at least £61,950.' He added that 30 fakes had been sold through well known auction houses and respected galleries across Britain. Mr Aspden said: 'He occasionally produced fake documents as proof of . provenance. The forgeries were mainly in the style of post-war British . artists including Jack Pender, Mary Fedden, Sandra Blow, Terry Frost and . Wilhelmina Barns-Graham.' The 40-year-old kept literature entitled Confessions of a Master Forger and The Art Forger's Handbook at his home - but maintains he didn't paint the fakes himself. When interviewed by police the married father of three admitted that respected auction house Sothebys was pursuing him for a refund for the sale of a £65,000 George Leslie Hunter work. He was not prosecuted for this. Art show: PC Jason Helmn with an example of one of the fakes Rahman sold as an original . He explained the paintings in the style of world famous artists Picasso, Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon at his home were decorative items he bought for £80. Mr Aspden added: 'The defendant had been dealing in fake works of art on a significant scale.' Rahman sold 13 forgeries of work by Mary Fedden, described in court as one Britain's greatest living artists, whose Royal College of Art pupils included a young David Hockney. Now in her 90s, she was shown one of the fakes. 'She was less than impressed by the forger's work, saying it was a very bad painting,' Mr Aspden said. Owners of galleries all over the country including Cornwall, London and Uppingham, Leicestershire, were initially taken in by the defendant, but soon became suspicious. Rahman now faces a proceeds of crime hearing to seize his assets and faces losing his home in the affluent area characterised by expensive Victorian properties. Steven Newcombe, defending, said Rahman repaid most of the cash as soon as there was a complaint. He set up his art dealing business in 2004 and made many genuine sales adding: 'It wasn't fraudulent from the outset.' Rahman, who traded under the name of Haslam and Purdy, admitted two counts of fraudulent trading, eight counts of selling false works and two of possessing articles (documents) for use in fraud. He was jailed for 18 months.","Dealer told galleries his father gifted the fine art to him .

Nicolas Sarkozy will this week appear before a judge to answer allegations that he accepted illegal cash from France’s richest woman, it emerged today. In a humiliating process which could end with the former president being jailed, Mr Sarkozy has been summoned to a court in Bordeaux. There he will be grilled by Judge Jean-Michel Gentil about his highly suspicious relationship with l’Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt. Controversial:  Nicolas Sarkozy, right, will be grilled about his highly suspicious relationship with l’Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, left . Mr Sarkozy, 57, is said to have personally accepted brown envelopes full of cash from the multi-millionaire’s family. They were paid to help fund Mr Sarkozy’s 2007 election campaign, in return for massive tax breaks when he came to office, it is alleged. Fraud squad officers have already raided the Paris home Mr Sarkozy shares with his former supermodel wife, Carla Bruni. This happened just two weeks after the conservative Mr Sarkozy lost his immunity from prosecution after being defeated in the May presidential election by Francois Hollande, the Socialist candidate. It was the first time that a former president’s home was subjected to a police raid, with Socialist interior minister Manuel Valls saying that Mr Sarkozy ‘is answerable to the law like anyone else.’ A number of former employees of Mrs Bettencourt have the told the judge that Mr Sarkozy discreetly turned up at her mansion in the Paris suburb of Neuilly to pick up money. Embarrassing: Fraud squad officers have already raided the Paris home Mr Sarkozy shares with his former supermodel wife, Carla Bruni . Judge Gentil has already cited two withdrawals of 400,000 euros each by Mrs Bettencourt which are said to have been handed over in person to Mr Sarkozy and his former treasurer, Eric Woerth. Mr Woerth later became employment minister but resigned in 2010 over the growing funding scandal, over which he has now been charged. French law limits individual donations to political parties to 7,500 euros (£6,000) per person per year and 4,600 euros (£3,700) during political campaigns. Only 150 euros (£120) may be given in cash. Mr Sarkozy was due to appear before the Bordeaux judge on Friday, but the appearance was moved back to this week, reported Paris radio station Europe 1. Last December Mr Sarkozy’s predecessor as president and mentor, Jacques Chirac, was found guilty of embezzlement in a Paris court and given a suspended prison sentence. Mr Sarkozy can be questioned as a ‘witness’ or a ‘suspect’ or placed under formal investigation – one step short of a charge - for breaking electoral law. If prosecuted and found guilty, Mr Sarkozy would also face jail. Mr Sarkozy, who has been unemployed since May, denies any wrong-doing. He is facing a number of other corruption enquiries, including claims that he accepted millions from former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Sarkozy has previously claimed that the Gaddafi accusations are 'grotesque'.","Sarkozy will be grilled about his highly suspicious relationship with l’Oreal .

Former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis  yesterday became the fourth person to be arrested by police investigating allegations of sexual abuse following the Jimmy Savile scandal. The 67-year-old was held during an early-morning raid at his £1million home in rural Buckinghamshire over allegations of sexual assault dating back to the late 1960s. The arrest came as Scotland Yard said the number of potential victims of historic abuse linked to Savile had risen to 450. Bailed: Dave Lee Travis arrives home after leaving Aylesbury police station. Police say that they have bailed a man in his 60s as part of an investigation into allegations of sexual abuse by broadcaster Jimmy Savile . TV chiefs had to pull a 1977 episode of Top Of The Pops featuring Travis that was due to be shown on BBC4 last night. He is the fourth man to be arrested by police investigating hundreds of allegations made after Savile was outed as a predatory paedophile. Five hours' questioning: Dave Lee Travis and Wife Marian Griffin in 1986 . Former BBC producer Wilfred De’ath, 73, disgraced pop star Gary Glitter, 68, and comedian Freddie Starr, 69, remain on bail. A fifth man, Savile’s former driver Ray Teret, 71, was questioned by officers in Manchester about child sex offences last week. His case is being treated separately. A team of police officers arrived in a convoy of marked and unmarked cars at Travis’s home in the village of Mentmore at 7.45am yesterday. He was taken to Aylesbury police station where he was questioned for more than five hours by specialist officers. Travis was driven home in a silver Audi at 9.20pm, after spending more than 12 hours in custody and being released on bail. He declined to comment and his solicitor said he would not be making any statement. Several claims have already been made that the DJ, who still has a weekend show at Magic AM, groped women colleagues in the 1970s and 1980s. Television and radio broadcaster Vivien Creegor claimed he ‘jiggled her breasts’ while live on Radio 4 in the 1980s. Mrs Creegor, 55, who went on to become a presenter on Sky News, claimed Travis clamped his hands over her jumper as she made a live announcement. Scroll down for video .

Before long, he decided to pursue his nighttime hobby of DJing full time. He gave up his other jobs to go on a self-created and promoted tour of clubs, ballrooms and theatres throughout the UK and America. When he returned, he did a stint at anti-establishment pirate radio station Radio Caroline on ships floating off the coasts of Essex and the Isle of Man. He moved to the BBC in 1967 where he joined the newly-founded Radio 1. The high point of his career came in 1978 when he took over the breakfast show from Noel Edmunds and re-branded himself to listeners as the Hairy Cornflake. It was not long before he was considered something of a national treasure. He resigned on-air in 1993 during his Sunday morning show, saying he could not agree with changes being made to Radio 1. He went on the present the BBC World Service music request programme A Jolly Good Show. And it was this show that Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi said had given her a lifeline during her captivity. She said the show had made her ‘world much more complete' to which Travis responded that he was ‘touched but ‘not surprised’ that she had remembered it.

Peter and Marian Sycamore, who watched their £50,000 retirement dream wash down the River Nene before smashing into a lock . A devastated couple had to flee for their lives after their 60ft houseboat was washed down a river weir – because they forgot to sign up for flood warnings. Peter and Marian Sycamore were returning cruising down the river during a relaxing break on the £50,000 river barge when conditions suddenly got dangerous. They were sailing along the River Nene in Northamptonshire when heavy rain and rising water levels began to pull the 14-tonne boat under the surface. The couple leapt off the sinking boat with their two dogs just in time, before watching in horror as strong currents caused their retirement-dream boat to smash into Ditchford Lock. The . boat is being refloated today - more than a week after it sank - so . that it can be moved and the river reopened. However boating experts . already believe the vessel will never be river-going again. The couple said they had received no . flood warnings or messages not to travel, despite torrential rain making . the stretch of river unsafe for boats. Crash: Pumping operations are being used to recover the sunken narrowboat, which was submerged for over a week . They thought they been added to the Environment Agency's emergency warning system - but failed to realise boat owners must sign up for every river they travel on. Mrs Sycamore, 58, said: ‘I feel so lucky to be alive. It came to the point when it was almost tilted completely over before I got off. Accident: The narrowboat sank at Ditchford Lock in Northamptonshire after conditions got difficult . Pumping out water: The narrowboat is refloated and safely moored so that the river can be reopened . ‘We would never do something that would be reckless. I did not receive any emails from the EA Floodline alert telling us not to travel. ‘The flags at the lock were green and were not changed to red until after our boat sank. We are really, really upset. We had spent a lot of money doing it up to make it homely.’ The couple had remortgaged their home in Swavesey, Cambridgeshire, to pay for the boat. Stuck: The 60ft vessel hit the sluice gate on the River Nene when water levels rose . They bought it five years ago for £25,000 and ploughed another £15,000 into repainting it, fitting a fire, solar panels and decorating it. Luckily, the couple say they have £40,000 of insurance cover and believe they will qualify for a payout because the Environment Agency classify the damage as an accident. Mr Sycamore said: ‘Rivers are so unpredictable. The water gushed in to the engine and cut out theelectricity. Luckily the boat is insured. Lucky escape: The narrowboat became wedged against a river sluice gate - fortunately its owners managed to escape before it started to sink . ‘But the only positive thing is that my wife and I are alive. She was on the back of the boat and could have been thrown in to the water and in to the sluice. ‘One of our dogs jumped off and I went back on to the boat to rescue the other one. The Environment Agency said today that river users have to sign up for weather alerts for every waterway they travel on. A spokesman said: ‘Signing up for advice on one river does not give up updates for every Anglian waterway. ‘People should make sure they are signed up for the specific river they are using. ‘A message was sent to every person signed up for River Nene strong stream advice service at 9.30am on Thursday, November 1. ‘The advice not to use the River Nene on Floodline was also in place from Thursday morning. ‘The flag poles along the River Nene are managed by unpaid volunteers. ‘Warning signs are in place at various locations along the river, and they are deployed by Environment Agency operatives who work their way along the waterway when strong stream advice is issued.’","Houseboat is being refloated today so that it can be moved and the river reopened .

"By . Valerie Elliott . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 17 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:00 EST, 17 November 2012 . Stark future: Grower Colin Palmer has seen the disease strike his Christmas trees . It’s Britain’s favourite Christmas tree, found in five million homes and much loved because the needles do not drop and make a mess. But the Nordmann fir may not feature in future celebrations because it is being attacked by a mysterious disease which causes its needles to fall off completely. One of Britain’s biggest growers has already suffered hefty losses. Hans Alexandersen, owner of H. A. Trim, which farms 600,000 Nordmann firs in Kent and Surrey, says ‘hundreds of thousands of pounds’ worth of trees have been devastated. Some other growers report losing a third of their stock. There are now fears the price of Christmas trees, which has risen over the past few years, could jump even further because of shortages caused by the disease. The condition – current season needle necrosis (CSNN) – has affected fir trees in the US and Europe for 20 years but was noticed in Britain for the first time only three years ago. Since then the fungus, which causes needles to turn yellow in July, brown in August, then drop off completely, has spread around the country. The British Christmas Tree Growers Association, which represents 300 growers, warned: ‘The disease could affect the number of marketable trees in future years if this continues.’ Outbreaks of the disease have affected 150 members of the BCTGA. Although most have reported damage to up to three per cent of their stock, some have experienced 15 per cent damage, and there are cases where a third of trees have been lost. The Nordmann fir is a popular festive choice. It is not known why the disease has become so virulent among the tree . The dramatic figures mean a grower with 2,500 trees on just an acre could have lost 833 trees. In such a case, with each tree fetching £25 wholesale, total losses would be £20,825. Many growers invest in at least 6,000 trees, so losses could be as much as £50,000. Colin Palmer, an adviser to the BCTGA, who has found disease  in some of his own trees growing near Ledbury, Herefordshire, said: ‘The disease is puzzling. It  is connected to a fungus, Sydowia polyspora, which has been around for 30 years without a problem. ‘We used to see trees lose their needles after strong sunshine.

He was sentenced to three years in a young offenders institute for a spree of burglaries . A teenager who posed for pictures brandishing a huge knife and boasted . on Facebook about his gang's spree of burglaries has been sentenced to . three years in a young offender institute. Brazen Adam Dutton even joked about how fast he was when he managed to run from police on an occasion when two of his accomplices were caught. Kitty Taylor, prosecuting at Leeds Crown Court, said Dutton also provided the police with further incriminating evidence having taken photos on his phone of some of the stolen items. Officers from North West Leeds Division’s Proactive Crime Team targeted the group after a spate of burglaries in their home area around Bramley, Leeds, West Yorkshire, back in March. As part of the investigation, police examined Facebook pages belonging to Dutton and his accomplices. Dutton was shown having conversations about 'naughty graft', which in criminal circles means committing crime, and stealing 'lappys', which is slang for laptop computers. During a three-week period, nine different properties were broken into including the home of a Methodist minister while he was giving a service. Dutton, 18, was sent to a young offender institution for three years. His accomplices Aaron Ward, 18, and Declan Blagborough, 17, were both given three years detention after admitting conspiracy to burgle houses. A fourth youth, age 16, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was given a youth rehabilitation order for 18 months with intensive supervision and a three month curfew from 7pm to 7am. Dutton had 22 offences taken into consideration involving more than £35,000 of property, while Ward had 35 offences taken into consideration involving £30,000 worth of property. Blagborough admitted seven other offences. After the sentencing, Sergeant Lee Fletcher of West Yorkshire Police said: 'Despite their young ages, these four are prolific offenders whose crimes have had a very significant impact on a lot of people’s lives. Aaron Ward, 18 . Adam Dutton, 18 . Declan Blagborough, 17 . 'They demonstrated their arrogance and disregard for their victims when they openly bragged about their involvement in crime on the internet. 'We are grateful to them for providing this additional evidence that supported our case against them. 'It is very pleasing to see them brought to justice and we hope it will provide some level of reassurance to their victims and the communities that have suffered as a result of their crimes. 'We also hope their downfall will act as a warning to other offenders who are on our radar and who can expect to face the same consequences when we catch them and put them before the courts.'

The Church of England will decide this week whether to approve a law to allow women bishops. The General Synod will hold a series of votes tomorrow, billed as the most significant decision it has taken since it backed women priests 20 years ago. The legislation needs a two-thirds majority in all three houses of the General Synod – of bishops, clergy and laity – to win final approval. Decision time: The Church of England will decide this week whether to approve a law to allow women bishops.  Both the outgoing Archbishop of Canterbury,  Dr Rowan Williams, left and his replacement, the Rt Rev Justin Welby, right, are in favour of the legislation . A defeat would be seen as a serious blow to Dr Rowan Williams, the outgoing Archbishop of Canterbury, who has been campaigning for a yes vote. The incoming Archbishop, the Rt Rev Justin Welby, has also urged the General Synod to vote for the legislation, saying that he is ‘deeply committed’ to the cause. A final vote on approval for the legislation was postponed in July, with bishops asked to reconsider a last-minute amendment which has now been rewritten. The debate this week is likely to centre on whether it is now acceptable to traditionalists. Commentators have said they believe it will clear the houses of bishops and clergy with the necessary majority but the vote among lay members of the General Synod is thought to be on a 'knife-edge'. More than 1,000 members of the Anglican clergy and senior laity have signed an open letter to The Independent urging the General Synod to vote in favour of women bishops in the ballot. Changes: If the legislation clears the final hurdle it will then go for approval in the Houses of Parliament, pictured, before receiving Royal Assent, paving the way for the first women bishops in 2014 . If the legislation clears the final hurdle it will then go for approval in the Houses of Parliament before receiving Royal Assent, paving the way for the first women bishops in 2014. A code of practice would also have to be drawn up outlining the arrangements to be made for traditionalists who do not accept the authority of a female bishop. If the legislation fails to clear the final hurdle it would take at least another five years before legislation on women bishops could be considered for final approval before the General Synod. The first women priests were ordained in 1994 and the Church gave its backing to the principle of women bishops in 2005 and 2006. The legislation has received the backing of 42 out of the 44 Church of England dioceses. But the Church has struggled to reach a compromise between those campaigning in favour of women bishops and traditionalists threatening a walk-out over the issue. A final vote on approval for the legislation was postponed in July, with the Church of England bishops asked to reconsider a last-minute amendment amid protests from pro-women campaigners. The amendment has been rewritten - and the debate is likely to centre on whether this is now acceptable to traditionalists. Prebendary Rod Thomas, a vicar in Plymouth, and chairman of Reform, the conservative evangelical grouping, and the Rev Canon Simon Killwick, chairman of the Catholic Group in the General Synod, have called for members to vote against giving the legislation final approval. Mr Thomas said: 'We are urging General Synod members to vote against the draft measure, not to abstain, we are doing so on the grounds that the provision it makes for people like us is completely inadequate for the longer term. Disagreement: The Church has struggled to reach a compromise between those campaigning in favour of women bishops and traditionalists threatening a walk-out over the issue. St Paul's Cathedral is pictured . 'We know that it is on a knife-edge - we think that, depending on which way the debate goes on the day, there could be enough people to stop the measure going through.' Martin Dales, spokesman for the Catholic Group in the General Synod, which has around 80 members, said he believed the electronic voting system this time - compared with the use of the lobbies in 1992 - could make a difference. 'The difference here from what happened in the 1990s is that there is electronic voting so you will not be being swayed to jump through lobbies. From what people have told me, people were persuaded to go through particular doors,' he said. 'The voting this time will be done on your own, with your own personal machine. It will not be until a fortnight afterwards that you will be able to see who has done what when the lists are published.' The Rev Rachel Weir, chairman of the campaigning group Watch (Women and the Church), said they were urging people to vote for the measure. 'We know that it is close and that some people will make up their minds finally on the day, listening to the arguments and going with the sense of what is right, so nobody knows really with any accuracy what is going to happen. 'We really hope that this goes through after all this time. 'Nobody is saying this is a perfect measure, we are not saying ""how fantastic, we have got everything we wanted"", we are not saying that at all, because it is not true. 'But we have been debating this whole question for 12 years and we really do need to make a decision.' She added: 'Some, from both sides, want to wait in the hope of getting something better, but to do so would be incredibly destructive. 'Another 10 years going over and over the same arguments would cripple the Church’s credibility and mission. It would also deprive the Church of the skills and wisdom of women bishops. To waste our time and talents in this way would be quite wrong.'","The General Synod will hold a series of .

Jeremy Paxman has dismissed rumours he is quitting Newsnight in the wake of the botched exposé that falsely linked a Tory peer to a paedophile ring. The presenter denied claims that he has become 'deeply disillusioned' with the crisis engulfing the Corporation and insisted he would 'definitely' be returning to the flagship show this week. However, he has refused to confirm whether he would remain there for the long term. I'll be back: Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman (pictured) insists he will be returning to the show on Wednesday amid rumours he is quitting over a bungled child abuse expose . Mr Paxman, who has worked on the programme for 23 years, told the Daily Telegraph: 'I have been away filming, but I will definitely be there on Wednesday'. The 62-year-old provoked fears he would leave Newsnight earlier this month after he blamed 'cowards and incompetents' for the departure of director general George Entwistle following the bungled child abuse documentary. The BBC2 programme aired false allegations which led to former Conservative treasurer Lord McAlpine being wrongly identified as a paedophile. Speaking earlier this month, Mr Paxman said: 'George Entwistle's departure is a great shame. The real problem here is the BBC's decision, in the wake of the Hutton Inquiry, to play safe by appointing biddable people. 'They then compounded the problem by enforcing a series of cuts on programme budgets, while bloating the management. That is how you arrive at the current mess on Newsnight.' Outspoken: Paxman, who has worked on the flagship programme for 23 years, provoked fears he would leave after blaming 'cowards and incompetents' for the departure of director general George Entwistle . Lord McAlpine (left) was wrongly identified on Twitter as a paedophile following claims on Newsnight by former care home resident Steve Messham (right) that he was abused as a child by a senior Tory figure . The BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten and acting director general Tim Davie are deciding whether the programme can survive the corporation's crisis. Lord McAlpine last week agreed a £185,000 compensation settlement with the BBC and his lawyers are also pursuing further possible claims from Twitter users who wrongly named him as having abused children at a children's home. The Newsnight investigation at the Bryn Estyn children’s home in North Wales in the 1970s was a joint project with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which is also being sued by Lord McAlpine. BBC insiders have been left staggered that the show's acting editor Liz Gibbons and duty lawyers did not insist that the claims by former care home resident Stephen Messham in the programme were put to the peer. In turmoil: BBC director general George Entwistle (left) resigned over the Newsnight fiasco, while BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten (right) is currently assessing whether the BBC2 show has a future . Mr Entwistle resigned over the fiasco and Mr Overton quit his job over his disastrous Twitter message advertising the Newsnight programme ahead of its broadcast. Newsnight carried a full, on-air apology a week after it aired and Lord McAlpine's World At One interview was carried across BBC news broadcasts. In the interview, he said he was 'conscious' that his £185,000 settlement would be paid by licence-payers and not directly by those who made or authorised the programme. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism published an apology to Lord McAlpine on its website 'for the extent to which its contribution to the Newsnight broadcast on 2 November fell short of the high standards it expects and for any incorrect speculation about the identity of the politician that may have been encouraged by the Bureau’s Managing Editor’s tweet in advance of the broadcast'. Newsnight's editor Peter Rippon had earlier been forced to stand aside after refusing to air an investigation into claims Jimmy Savile had abused children.","Presenter denies being 'deeply disillusioned' as scandal engulfs BBC .

The sprawling compound, run by the feared East German State Security known as the Stasi, was never noted on East German maps and the area was simply left a blank. But most locals were left in little doubt of the horrors that what went on inside what they knew simply as Stasi Prison. Haunting: A room inside the dreaded Hohenschönhausen prison where between 1951 and 1989, East German security known as the Stasi detained thousands of political prisoners . Eerie: Cooking pots lie rusting and abandoned inside a storage room at Hohenschönhausen where little has been changed since it was shut following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 . Between 1951 and 1989, thousands of political prisoners, including many notable figures who opposed the GDR government and its policies, were detained at Hohenschönhausen where they were subjected to extreme interrogation techniques. The goal of Hohenschönhausen Prison staff was to destabilize prisoners in order to generate a feeling of total powerlessness. Prisoners were never informed as to where they were being held and were essentially completely sealed off from the outside world. To incapacitate them more, they were also kept in strict isolation from their fellow prisoners. The effect of such conditions was to break down the prisoners so that they felt totally at the mercy of an almighty state authority. Interrogations were particularly cruel at the prison.

On October 3, 1990, when the German Democratic Republic was incorporated into the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hohenschönhausen Prison was finally closed. Photographer Philipp Lohöfener told Wired Magazine: 'I went home with more than the images.

MPs will have the chance to deny prisoners the vote once and for all, following a bitter seven-year dispute with the European Court of Human Rights. A free vote is set to be held on maintaining the blanket ban, as demanded by David Cameron who said the idea of prisoners voting made him feel sick. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling insists parliament has the right to reject the controversial European ruling, although Britain could be slapped with a fine, and a compensation bill from prisoners suing the Government which could run to £100million. Sickening: David Cameron said the idea of prisoners voting made him feel sick while Justice secretary Chris Grayling insists parliament has the right to reject the ruling from the European Court of Human Rights . Mr Grayling will lay out three options for consultation in a draft bill on Thursday - retaining the current ban, or allowing votes for certain prisoners serving up to six months or up to four years. Friday is the deadline to comply with the 2005 ECHR ruling that denying prisoners the vote breaches their human rights. The Court says individual countries can decide which prisoners should be denied votes, but not impose a total ban. A vote on the law would not be held before next year but Britain is highly unlikely to comply with the Court as a non-binding vote last February saw an overwhelming vote of 234 MPs to 22 back maintaining the ban. Obligation: Attorney General Dominic Grieve says that legally Britain must comply with the directive . Labour yesterday voiced its support for the status quo, saying the Court should respect Britain’s ‘sensible and proportionate’ stance. Few Liberal Democrats are expected to rebel. While concerns have been raised by Attorney General Dominic Grieve that Britain is under an international legal obligation to comply, the Prime Minister is determined to stand firm. He told MPs last month he was happy to introduce legislation to ‘help put the legal position beyond doubt’ and said ‘no-one should be in any doubt: prisoners are not getting the vote under this Government.’ Tory MP Peter Bone welcomed what he said was ‘the Government for the first time... saying Parliament’s decisions will overrule the European Court’. He added: ‘The British people want Parliament to be supreme, ignore this Mickey Mouse European Court.’ Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said a vote on legislation would strengthen the UK’s argument on retaining the ban, and that passing a binding law - rather than a motion as in the past - could force the European Court to look at the issue again. However critics fear Britain’s hands could be tied. Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn said ignoring the Court’s ruling would leave ministers unable to criticise countries which flout the rules and summarily lock up their citizens. He said: ‘If you say total defiance of the European Court of Human Rights, your influence criticising any other country that breach the European Court of Human Rights is zero.’ Warning: Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn and Tory MP Dominic Raab have warned about going against European law . The Government is being sued by 500 inmates for being denied the vote. Yesterday their lawyer Sean Humber of law firm Leigh Day and Co said the claims were already ‘running into the millions’ and that the vote was ‘unlikely to satisfy the court or stave off costly legal action.’ Under the Strasbourg ruling, the government has until Thursday to come forward with proposals for ending Britain’s ‘general, automatic and indiscriminate disenfranchisement of all serving prisoners.’ Dominic Raab, the Tory MP and a former lawyer at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, said: ‘We are heading for a constitutional clash, putting Strasbourg’s political agenda on a collision course with Britain’s democratic prerogatives.’ A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said the Government was ‘considering how best to proceed following the judgment of the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights’ and that an announcement would be made to Parliament shortly.’","Justice Secretary Chris Grayling says parliament has the right to reject European ruling .

It is estimated that the buyers of the . pier would be faced with a bill of £2 million to restore the property to . its former glory. The pier, which was used in preparation for the D-Day landings, is one of only 55 private piers left in Britain. The sale follows recent difficulties experienced by its owners Fred Nash and Dawn Randall, with the pier going into administration twice in the past 18 months as well as being partly closed because of safety fears. Scroll down for video . Rare: South Parade Pier is one of just 55 private piers left in Britain but is being auctioned with a guide price of just £210,000 . Closed: The Victorian structure closed earlier this year amid safety concerns and the auctioneers admit it does investment. Potential: Auctioneer Rob Marchant, from Clive Emson, said with a bit of investment there is no reason why the pier's two venues 'can't be successful again' The Victorian structure, which was . completed in 1878 and officially opened by Prince Edward,  boasts a . colourful history including three fires. The last fire was in 1974 during the filming of the rock opera Tommy and, in a scene from the film involving Oliver Reed, smoke is visible. The Victorian pier began life at a time when Disraeli was Prime Minister as a terminal for ferries travelling to and from the Isle of Wight, but in 1904 it suffered its first fire and was completely rebuilt at a cost of £85,000. The new 'pleasure pier' became a centre for entertainment and later boasted a 1,200 seat theatre that attracted the biggest names of the day. At the outbreak of war the pier was requisitioned by the government and it played a key role in the D-Day preparation and embarkation. After the war it attracted heroes of the age including Frankie Howerd and Peter Sellers, then it was rebuilt again in 1967 following a second fire. After that, stars including David Bowie and Genesis played there and after the 1974 fire the pier was rebuilt in sympathy with its history and it now it boasts several venues. The sale is being handled by Clive Emson . land and property auctioneers which describes it as a ""unique opportunity . to acquire a substantial freehold Victorian pier for restoration"". In recent years, the pier has consisted of an amusement arcade, shops and two venues which have hosted concerts and nightclubs including a show by Damon Albarn's project The Good, The Bad and The Queen in 2007. There is the 'Gaiety Suite' with a capacity of 750 that includes a stage, dressing rooms, kitchens and bar, and also a smaller licensed bar with a capacity of 400. Fires: The pier has a colourful history including three fires. In 1974, smoke can be seen pouring from the structure during a scene in rock opera Tommy, in which the pier featured . Opportunity: Auctioneers believe the pier can be brought back to life as a top local attraction. It comes complete with two bars that can hold more than 1,000 people . Legends: The Gaiety Lounge Show Bar played host to big names such as David Bowie, Manfred Mann and Genesis during the early 1970s . A substantial basement that has lain unused for many years is also included. And there is the 'open east passage' that leads to the southern end of the pier that used to house fairground-style stalls, rides and crazy golf. It also has a boardroom, a fishing platform and stunning views across the Solent and the Isle of Wight beyond. The unusual lot is among 135 being sold through Clive Emson, the regional land and property auctioneers. Earlier this year the pier closed and does require investment. However, experts believe the building has the potential to become a major attraction once again. It will go under the hammer on Wednesday, December 12, at the Ageas Bowl in Southampton with a guide price of £190,000 to £210,000. History: The pier was built in 1878 and has hosted a host of show business favourites such as Mr Bean and The Who. It can be seen in its full former glory in this picture taken in 1935 . Busy: The Balmoral leaves the pier in 1935. By the turn of the century, it had become very busy with steamers calling in up to four times an hour. Birdseye: An aerial view of the pier taken in 1936 - three years before it was requisitioned by the military and used as a depot. It was also deliberately damaged so it could not be used in the case of invasion . Change of fortune: While crowds would flock to the pier in the 1940s to see acts such as Primo Scala and His Accordion Band, left, in 2012 passersby can see the fading signs and closed shutters of a shop on the pier promenade. In April this year the structure was shut to the public because of safety concerns . Postcard: A picture of South Parade Pier during its heyday . Former glory: The pier used to boast the 1,200 Pavilion Theatre but much of the building was destroyed in a 1967 fire . Grand: The 600ft pier, pictured in 1908, was designed by local entrepreneur G.E. Smith . Bandstand: Following the rebuild after the first fire, the pier boasted a bandstand, pictured, and wind-screens to shield visitors from strong gusts . Rob Marchant, from Clive Emson, said: 'The pier offers huge scope, but needs investment, and might be snapped up for the price of a three-bedroom semi. 'It has two venues that in more recent times have held concerts and events, and there is no reason why they can't be successful again. 'Other privately-owned piers have shown they can be commercially viable and this is a great looking pier with magnificent views. 'It also comes with a long and interesting history and it remains a Victorian pier that still has a long life ahead of it despite its age. 'I'm sure there is an investor out there who could revive the fortunes of this grand old structure.' Details of the freeholder have not been disclosed. A spokesman for the National Piers Society said: 'South Parade pier dates from 1879 and has a distinguished history. 'It is a listed structure and needs someone who can restore it to its former glory while at the same time appealing to 21st century consumers. 'Given its existing facilities the possibilities are enormous.' Flames: The pier building was engulfed in fire and smoke which spread after curtains were accidentally set alight during filming for Tommy . Inferno: Sunbathers watch as the flames spread along the pier after the fire started during filming for Tommy . Destroyed: Smoke and flames can be seen billowing from the roof of the pier building after it caught fire during filming for rock opera Tommy in 1974 . Disaster: It is believed the fire started when a spotlight set some curtains on fire during a scene with Oliver Reed. Firefighters managed to stop the whole structure being destroyed but large parts of it were lost to the flames . Historic: The pier was used as a preparation area for the D-Day landings eight years after this picture was taken . 1875 - Work begins on South Parade Pier - the second pier to be built in Southsea - and took three years to complete. It was originally designed to be used by holiday makers travelling to the Isle of Wight. 1879 - Prince Edward opens the structure. 1855 - A short-lived railway service between Fratton and Granada road runs. It was closed in 1914 making it the shortest lived railway in England and the shortest in length. 1902 - Steamers arrive at the pier up to four times an hour and visitors enjoy daily concert parties with performances by the South Parade Pier band. 1904 - First South Parade Pier fire left the pier needing a complete rebuild after it destroyed the original structure. 1906 - Portsmouth Corporation bought pier for £12,327 . 1908 - New 600ft pier completed for £85,000. It was designed as a pleasure pier rather than a landing jetty and featured a then-pioneering concrete deck instead of a wooden one. It also boasted a bandstand and the 1,200 Pavilion Theatre. 1939 - Pier requisitioned by the military and used as a depot. Explosives were set on the decks ready to detonate if there was an invasion. 1944 - Used as a preparation area for the D-Day landings. 1950s - Pier plays host to Peter Sellers, Eddie Grey and Arthur English and Reginald Dixon. 1967 - Pier bought by Fortes Ltd and endured its second fire which destroyed a lot of the theatre. 1971 - After the pier was rebuilt, it hosted David Bowie, Genesis, and Manfred Mann who played the Gaiety Lounge Show Bar. 1974 - Caught fire for a third time during filming for Ken Russell's rock opera Tommy.

Mr Sarkozy could soon be placed under investigation as part of a probe into illegal party funding from France’s richest woman, the L’Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt.

President of the CBI Sir Roger Carr today said there was more to do 'salvage the reputation of business' Some of Britain’s corporate giants and their bosses have been greedy and have forgotten fairness, the leader of the country’s biggest business lobby group warned yesterday. CBI president Sir Roger Carr said employers need to work to urgently ‘salvage the reputation of business’. He told more than 1,000 business leaders at the CBI’s annual conference that the corporate sector is littered with examples of ‘bad behaviour’. Sir Roger is also chairman of Centrica, the owner of British Gas, which is under fire for raising its energy bills just as winter begins. Sir Roger, who did not name and shame any individual firms, said: ‘As businesses and individuals, standards have been variable, greed occasionally prevalent and fairness forgotten in a number of sectors. ‘Banking and media [are] at the forefront, but others from all walks of life sometimes also show signs of bad behaviour.’ Sir Roger, who was chairman of Cadbury when it was controversially bought by the American processed cheese giant Kraft, said it is wrong to ‘tar’ all firms with the same brush. Ruling the rule: Sir Roger Carr (right) with Ian King BAE Systems Chief Executive and John Cridland, Director General CBI, were all at the conference today . He said it is wrong to say that ‘all energy companies rip you off, when they don’t, all bankers are despicable, when they are not, or big business is bad business, when it isn’t’. His attack comes amid a growing controversy about the amount of tax paid by some of the biggest names in business such as Google, Starbucks and Amazon. For example, Google paid only £6million to the Treasury last year on UK sales of £2.6billion. Business Secretary Vince Cable said it is easier to make the case for businesses when they act responsibly on executive pay  and tax. Warning: David Cameron and George Osborne have been warned by Sir Roger Carr to stop large scale austerity measures . Mayor of London Boris Johnson told . the conference in London that ‘Google and co’ should either change their . tax arrangements or do more to serve society by taking on more . unemployed 18 to 24-year-olds. A Google spokesman said: ‘We make a substantial contribution to the UK economy through local, payroll and corporate taxes. ‘We also employ over 2,000 people, . help hundreds of thousands of businesses to grow online and invest . millions supporting new tech businesses in East London. We comply with . all the tax rules in the UK.’ 'Exam factories': The CBI have also hit out at the standard of schools saying the system 'fosters a cult of the average' CBI director-general John Cridland said the educational system is failing the young .","Head of lobby group CBI, Sir Roger Carr calls on businesses to repair reputation after years of 'bad behaviour'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:08 EST, 20 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:08 EST, 20 November 2012 . Justice: Sanader looks on as he awaits sentencing today . Former Croatian prime minister Ivo Sanader was sentenced to ten years in prison today for taking bribes from two foreign companies. Croatia is due to join the EU in July next year and his conviction is likely to be seen as evidence the country is cracking down on corruption. Its efforts to fight crime are being carefully monitored before it formally joins the bloc. Sanader is the highest state official to be convicted of corruption in Croatia. A Zagreb county court found Sanader, 59, guilty of agreeing in 2008 to accept a payment from Hungary's energy group MOL of 5 million euros in exchange for granting it full management rights over Croatia's oil concern INA. The ruling, which Sanader is likely to appeal,  might prompt Croatia to review MOL's shareholder agreement with INA. Judge Ivan Turudic also said Sanader had taken a fee from Austrian Hypo Alpe Adria Bank in 1995, when he was deputy foreign minister, that prosecutors had described as 'war profiteering'. Croatia's war of independence from Serbian-led federal Yugoslavia was winding down at the time. Sanader, who looked drawn and thoughtful in court, has strongly denied wrongdoing and dismissed the trial as politically motivated. He will be detained until the appeal. 'You have damaged Croatia's reputation. Because you were a top state official, this verdict is a message to those engaged in politics that crime does not pay,' Turudic said. The world watches: International media gather as Sanader awaits his fate today . Justice is seen to be done: People watch the trial unfold on a TV at a coffee bar in Zagreb . 'This verdict will certainly be welcomed in the EU, and it sets a benchmark for all EU candidate countries,' said Drazen Rajkovic, author of the book How Sanader Stole Croatia. As prime minister between 2004 and 2009, Sanader was the most powerful man in Croatia, known for smart suits and expensive watches, and his fall from grace coincides with Croatia's campaign to root out corruption. Sanader resigned in July 2009, unexpectedly and without explanation. Jadranka Kosor, his hand-picked successor, then launched an anti-corruption drive that helped Zagreb complete European Union entry talks in June 2011. Sanader faces another trial - together with his former conservative HDZ party, which is now in opposition - on charges of creating slush funds for the party by skimming off profits from state companies and by manipulating public tenders. Despite the market jitters over MOL's future in INA, Croatia's biggest utility engaged in exploration, drilling, refining and retail, analysts said there was no alarm yet. In a brief statement, MOL said it 'continues to categorically reject' accusations made in the trial and vowed to work further to make INA more profitable and successful. 'The chance of a retroactive break-up of MOL and INA is less than one per cent,' Raiffeisen Bank equity analyst Levente Blaho said. 'The verdict is at the first instance, this might very well change further down the line. 'MOL has said time and again that it did nothing wrong and that it would defend this in open court. It is not positive that the company was named in the verdict but it should have no dramatic effect on the share price now.' MOL has slightly more than a 49 per cent stake in INA and the Croatian government almost 45 per cent. Relations over management rights have been strained for the past few years.","Ivo Sanader took bribes worth millions of euros from two foreign companies .

Italian police are investigating the bizarre 'kidnapping' of sleazy former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's accountant whose key role was to pay women invited to the politician's infamous 'bunga Bunga' parties. Giuseppe Spinelli, 71, was held hostage in his own home at gunpoint for 24 hours by six masked men who bundled him and his wife to the ground as he arrived home. They had demanded 35 million Euros from Berlusconi in return for sensitive information which they said would show how he had been framed by former ally Gianfranco Fini in one of his numerous fraud trials. Kidnapped: Giuseppe Spinelli, accountant and ally to former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, was taken hostage by armed men last month, police said today . Key role: It has been alleged that Mr Spinelli paid young women to attend Berlusconi's (pictured) notorious bunga bunga sex parties . However, no ransom money was handed over and Mr Spinelli and his wife Anna were not harmed in the incident, which took place on October 16. Police were only informed a day later after Berlusconi's personal security team ensured they were safe. Today prosecutors questioned Mr Spinelli again about what happened at his Milan apartment, as it emerged that six people, three Italians and three Albanians, had been arrested by police in connection with the incident. During the kidnapping terrified Mr Spinelli was ordered at gunpoint to call Berlusconi and demand the money in return for a CD which held evidence which would be useful to him in his fight against a 560m Euro fine he had been hit with after a corruption case finished. However Niccolo Ghedini, who is Berlusconi's lawyer and who was also involved in negotiations with the kidnappers said no money was paid as it quickly became apparent the men had nothing of significance and were 'unable to show the documents.' Mr Ghedini said: 'In truth they did not have anything in their hands. They kidnapped the accountant but Spinelli couldn't say anything as he was so scared about what might happen to his wife and daughter. He was terrified because he had a gun pointed at him.' Police said the ringleader of the gang, Francesco Leone, 51, was traced after a fingerprint was found at the scene and by the fact he wore red and black trainers - the colours of AC Milan, the football team owned by Berlusconi. Despite claims from Mr Ghedini that no ransom was paid, prosecutors in Milan were said to be investigating whether a sum of around eight million Euros was paid as part of a ransom in the days following the kidnap. At the time of the incident Berlusconi had cancelled a scheduled meeting with Italian PM Mario Monti and a political conference in Bucharest, claiming he had a sudden bout of flu. Milan police spokesman Alessandro Giuliano said: 'We have arrested six people but the investigation is still continuing and we are looking at the circumstances before the incident and also immediately afterwards.' Mr Spinelli came into the spotlight last year after it emerged in Berlusconi's ongoing 'bunga bunga' trial that he had withdrawn 16 million Euros in cash from the media mogul's accounts to pay women who had been invited to the parties. Troubles: Mr Berlusconi, pictured here at an AC Milan match with billionaire Flavio Briatore, cancelled a meeting with Italian PM Mario Monti around the time of the kidnapping, saying he had flu . Party girl: Mr Berlusconi was accused of having sex with Karima El-Mahroug, widely known as Ruby Rubacuori ('heart-stealer') in 2010 when she was 17 . He had told the court: 'I was just following Berlusconi's orders. During the week the girls would speak to me and tell me what they needed then on Monday I would have a meeting with Berlusconi and he would tell me what amount to put in the envelopes. 'He asked me to bring the money in cash and I would put it in a safe at the villa. In 2009 I brought around €7,665,000 while in 2010 I brought around €12 million. Whenever large sums were needed I would forewarn the bank and they would break it down into smaller amounts for me. 'The money was for the girls living expenses and for bills, that sort of thing. We helped so many people and we still do.' Berlusconi hosted the parties at his villa near Milan and his trial has heard how women performed pole dances and strip teases for him, some wearing football kits or police uniforms while others dressed as nuns. He has insisted nothing untoward took place but he is on trial accused of paying an underage prostitute for sex and abuse of office. The case is just to end in January. Who me?

Foreign Secretary William Hague today told MPs in the House of Commons that the Government has decided to recognise the National Coalition of the Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces as the 'sole legitimate representative' of the Syrian people . Britain today recognised a coalition of Syrian rebels as the ‘sole legitimate representative’ of the Syrian people, clearing the way to offer arms in the battle to help overthrow President Assad. Foreign Secretary William Hague told the Commons it was in the UK’s interests to endorse the National Coalition of the Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces. He condemned the ‘barbaric violence’ which had led to the death of 30,000 people and refused to rule out any option ‘that might save innocent lives in Syria’. Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm . Rifkind said Britain’s recognition of the rebels ‘removes a major . barrier to the supply of defensive military equipment to the Syrian . resistance’. But other MPs warned against military intervention by UK troops. Mr . Hague met with leaders of the National Coalition last week. He said the . coalition had promised to leave the door open to other opposition . groups which wanted to join them, to appeal to Syrians from all . communities and to be a ‘moderate political force committed to . democracy’ that would not repeat President Assad's abuses. ‘On . the basis of the assurances I received during consultations with my . European partners yesterday, Her Majesty's Government has decided to . recognise the National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition . Forces as the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people,’ he . said in a statement in the Commons. Foreign Secretary William Hague today announced Britain would officially recognise the Syrian rebels, after meeting with President Sheikh Ahmed Moaz Al-Khatib of the Syrian opposition movement last week . He also announced a ‘significant increase’ in practical support for the Syrian opposition. The rebels will be invited to appoint a political representative to the UK – similar to an ambassador. He also promised £1 million in communications support, which could help create mobile internet hubs and satellite phones. A . stabilisation response team will be deployed to the region and . International Development Secretary Justine Greening is looking to . increase funding to Syrians affected by the conflict. Mr Hague faced calls to arm the Syrian rebels from former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind . Some 30,000 Syrian people have died in the conflict. Here a father comforts his son who has just undergone surgery for a bullet wound in his left shoulder outside a field hospital in the northwestern city of Maraat al-Numan, Syria . Mr Hague added: ‘A credible alternative to the Assad regime is emerging that has the growing support of the Arab League, the European Union, the United States and an increasing number of other countries; and we have an agreed basis for a transition in the form of the Geneva Communique which all permanent members of the United Nations Security Council signed up to in June. Sir Malcolm Rifkind said the recognition of the rebels removed a major barrier to arming them . 'But in the absence of that political and diplomatic solution, we will not rule out any option in accordance with international law that might save innocent lives in Syria and prevent the destabilisation of a region that remains critical to the security of the United Kingdom and the peace of the whole world.’ But he faced calls from the government benches to move quickly in providing military support. The current arms embargo expires on December 1. Sir Malcolm, who was Defence Secretary and Foreign Secretary under John Major, warned that the rebels in Syria had no hope without any defensive equipment. He told Mr Hague: 'Do you agree the emergence of the Syrian National Coalition and the Government's welcome recognition of it today removes a major barrier to the supply of defensive military equipment to the Syrian resistance? ‘Will you look at this constructively and will you recognise that what you describe rightly as the barbaric violence of the Syrian regime against the civilian communities will not come to an end unless and until the Syrian resistance are able to defend themselves?’ But Mr Hague insisted there was ‘no automatic change in our policy’ because of the recognition of the Syrian opposition but had discussed the issues with the French foreign minister. ‘The arms embargo is due to be continued from December 1 as part of the entire package of Syria sanctions. ‘We will keep all these options under review but we have made no decision to change our policy on arms supplies as things stand.’","Foreign Secretary tells MPs the UK government now views a coalition of rebels to be the 'sole legitimate representative' of the Syrian people .

It is believed to have targeted the computers of several advisers to the former President, including Chief of Staff Xavier Musca, during the elections in May, which he lost to socialist Francois Hollande. Lurking in the cyber shadows: France has accused the U.S. of infecting computers in Nicolas Sarkozy's presidential office with a sophisticated spyware virus during his failed attempt to win re-election in May .

In line of fire: Several of Sarkozy's advisers, including his Chief of Staff Xavier Musca (pictured) were allegedly targeted in May . The report says an attacker . masquerading as a 'false friend' of a presidential palace employee on . Facebook duped the employee into giving up an internal passcode, then . spread a worm on Elysee Palace computers including one used by . then-President Nicolas Sarkozy's chief-of-staff in May.

'We co-operate in many security-related areas. I am here to further reinforce those ties and create new ones.' The White House did not return a request for comment from The Hill. The alleged attack came as the United . Nations issued an urgent warning in May to guard against the Flame . virus, regarded as the most powerful computer bug ever unleashed, amid . fears it could be used to bring countries to a standstill. The . sophisticated spyware – said to be about 100 times the size of most . malicious software – was used to hack into computers in Iran, whose . nuclear programme continues to cause concern around the world that it is . being used to create an atomic bomb.

The family of a teenager crushed to death by a tree branch have been awarded an undisclosed pay-out. Sophie Howard, 13, was killed instantly after sustaining fatal head injuries when she was hit by the 20ft long branch. She was off school at time because of a teachers’ strike and was sat on a park bench under the 85-year-old Hybrid Black Poplar. Heartbreak: Sophie Howard's parents said no amount of money would ever make up for the loss of their daughter . The branch fell due to a natural phenomenon called Sudden Limb Drop Syndrome (SLDS) which causes branch limbs to randomly explode. The condition is caused by long periods of dry weather followed by a sudden down pour of rain. Branches which have been dried out can explode when it rains and the tree soaks up a lot of water. Sophie, who left a twin brother Elliott, died after she was hit by the branch on June 30, 2011. Days after the tragedy a second branch fell from the same tree - which had not been roped off and where friends and family were laying flowers. Experts who examined the tree in Yaxley, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, said it was full of decay and should have been felled by the council before the tragedy. An inspection carried out by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) a month after Sophie’s death found that eleven trees in the park were “high risk.” An inquest into Sophie’s death in December 2011 heard the tree was at “significant risk” of loosing branches. Yesterday Yaxley Parish Council agreed to pay an undisclosed out-of-court settlement to the family. Lessons: An inquest heard that another branch had fallen from the same tree days after the tragedy as mourners were leaving flowers. But Sophie’s parents Laura, a civil servant, and Martin, an account manager, said 'no amount of money' could make up for what happened. In a statement they said: 'The last 16 months have been horrendous as we’ve struggled to come to terms with the fact Sophie is no longer with us. 'She was a beautiful girl with her whole life ahead of her but this has been taken from her and it is heartbreaking. Her loss to us is immeasurable, and our grief endless. 'At first it seemed a tragic case of fate or wrong time, wrong place, sadly after the coroner’s inquest it became apparent that this was not the case. 'We just hope councils across the country take note and learn from the mistakes that led to Sophie’s death. 'Nothing can bring her back, and no amount of money could ever make up for what happened, but we want to be sure no one else suffers such a huge loss as we have.' Investigation: A Health and Safety Executive probe found 11 other trees in the park were of 'high risk' to the public . Tributes: Friends laid flowers and left emotional tributes at the tree where Sophie was killed in June last year . Sophie, an Year 8 pupil from Sawtry Community College, was spending the day at Middletons Road Recreation Ground after her school closed due to industrial action. The HSE found Yaxley Parish Council was not ensuring the health and safety of the public as it could not prove it had an effective system for managing trees in the park. Katrina Elsey, from lawyers Irwin Mitchell who represented the family, said: 'This is one of the most tragic cases I have ever worked on. 'We were determined to get answers for Sophie’s family to see if anything could have prevented her death and also ensure lessons are learnt by councils across the country to prevent a similar tragedy from happening again.' A spokesman for Yaxley Parish Council yesterday refused to comment.","Sophie Howard, 13, was killed instantly after being hit by the 20ft branch near Peterborough, Cambridgeshire .

Police officers investigating the horrific murders of a British family in the Alps believe they were shot by a serial killer with a hatred of tourists, it has emerged. The motive behind the horrific killings of Saad al-Hilli, his wife Iqbal and mother-in-law Suhaila Iqbal while on a camping holiday in the south of France have left detectives baffled.

His two sons Jordan, 7, and Dylan, five, were sleeping in his car when their father was killed. They escaped unharmed. The al-Hilli's were also on a camping trip in Annecy, France, when they were attacked. Police also believe the gun used in both attacks was very similar -  it is thought to have been used by the Swiss army before the First World War and is a collectors' item. Mr al-Hilli, 50, his 47-year-old wife Iqbal, his 74-year-old mother-in-law and French cyclist Mr Mollier, 45, were killed when a lone gunman opened fire at an isolated lay-by close to the village of Chevaline, near Lake Annecy.

A designer has created a fully functioning radio, which has the entire London tube map built in as its circuit. The impressive 45cm by 45cm contraption is accurately labeled with each of the 270 stations and took three months to make. The underground map as you've never seen it before: A designers created a working radio using the iconic London Underground map as circuits. Little touches talented artist Japanese designer Yuri Suzuki has added included choosing BBC's White City for the tuner and Hyde Park's Speaker's Corner for volume control. Oxford Circus has been changed to Oxford Circuit while Kensington has also been renamed Kensington (Resistor). Yuri, who has lived in London since 2006, said he was inspired by Harry Beck's iconic tube map design. Yuri, 31, said: 'I was asked to create something for the London Design Museum that showed how electricity worked. 'The tube map is designed by Harry Beck, who used to be an electrics engineer, and he got inspiration due to an electronic circuit board as well so it's a really nice connection. 'You can follow a tube map the same way you follow electronics. The device functions as an FM/AM radio, with the volume knob, fittingly, at Speakers Corner, the tuner control at 'BBC White City' and the option to switch frequencies at London Bridge. The battery is at Battersea Power Station. 'I've lived in London for six years and love the mixture of music and culture so it was the perfect tribute to the city.' It is not the only musical project he has developed recently. He also created The Sound Taxi, which is a black cab that turns London street noise into real time music as it travels around the capital's streets.

An Australian elephant keeper, who was almost crushed to death by the animal she had cared for from its birth, told for the first time today how she felt ‘challenged’ before the beast attacked her. Lucy Melo, 40, who spent 12 days in hospital after suffering a heart attack and severe injuries when the elephant pinned her to a metal bollard at Sydney’s Taronga Zoo, said she noticed a change in the usually timid Pathi Harn moments before the attack. Miss Melo gave a dramatic insight into the incident in a letter posted on the Taronga Zoo website today. Scroll down for video . Elephant attack: Zoo keeper Lucy Melo (pictured with an unknown elephant) was almost crushed to death by the animal when he pinned her to a metal bollard at Sydney's Taronga Zoo . She told how the elephant’s trunk, which he had forced against her chest, took her breath away and prevented her from ordering him to move away. Although conscious when paramedics arrived at the zoo, she then lapsed into a coma and had a cardiac arrest for about five minutes. The medics managed to save her life but she remained critical in hospital for several days afterwards. Miss Melo said she noticed a change in the two-year-old elephant – formerly known as Mr Shuffles – when he failed to respond to one of her orders during a routine training session. ‘When he did not respond, I sensed a behavioural change in him and realised he was thinking of challenging me,’ she wrote of the elephant she and other keepers had hand-reared followed his traumatic birth. Close call: Miss Melo told how the elephant put his trunk against her chest, took her breath away and prevented her from ordering him to move away at Taronga Zoo (pictured) ‘I immediately tried to redirect his thoughts by asking him for a different behaviour and at the same time I was making my way out of the stall. ‘Unfortunately, just as I was almost out, he raised his trunk and pinned me against one of the metal bollards. ‘His trunk on my chest took my breath away, which made it impossible for me to talk and tell him to stop.’ Miss Melo said it was fortunate that her co-workers were on hand to immediately move the elephant away. Cared since birth: The elephant, who lived in this enclosure at the zoo, caused Miss Melo to suffer a heart attack, severe injuries, and lapse into a coma . She suggested that Pathi Harn might have challenged her because of his low confidence levels following his traumatic birth, which had resulted in him being hand reared by Miss Melo and other keepers. Despite her injuries, which included broken ribs, Miss Melo has decided to courageously continue raising Pathi Harn. She said that being a part of raising the elephant after such a traumatic start to his life remained one of the biggest highlights of her career. She was looking forward, she said, to being reunited with Pathi Harn once her fractured ribs had healed.","Elephant keeper Lucy Melo spent 12 days in hospital after the attack .

A coroner yesterday urged parents to stop their children using adult video games after a boy of 14 hanged himself after playing Call of Duty. Callum Green regularly played the Certificate 18 game with his stepfather despite it featuring gruesome scenes of soldiers trying to kill each other. The boy’s behaviour deteriorated and, after being grounded by his mother following a row, he was found hanging by his school tie from his bunk bed. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Callum Green hanged himself after he had played the controversial video game Call of Duty . Scary: Call of Duty has an 18 certificate and is one of the gorier video games on the market . At the inquest, coroner John Pollard . issued a warning to parents to ensure children do not have access to . adult-only video games. He said: ‘The age limitations on these . various computer games are there for a very valid reason and I do see . the evidence of inappropriate computer games. ‘It’s very important that young . children don’t play them or have access to them. I make a plea with . parents to keep a very close eye on their children in that way.’ Earlier this year, Norwegian mass . killer Anders Breivik claimed he had ‘trained himself’ to kill his 77 . victims by playing Call of Duty. Discovery: The home of schoolboy Callum Green near Stockport, where he was found after a family row about being 'grounded' French terrorist Mohammed Merah also . played Call Of Duty before killing three soldiers and four civilians – . including a rabbi and three children – in Toulouse in March. The violence in Call of Duty has been . criticised by the London Jewish Forum, the British Muslim Forum and . Church of England ministers. Yesterday’s inquest was told Callum, . of Brinnington, Stockport, frequently played the game with his . stepfather, David White. Devastated: Emma Green, mother of Callum, admitted she had alowed him to play Call Of Duty but not other games . Callum’s mother, Emma Green, admitted she knew . about the game’s age restriction but had allowed him to play. She said: ‘Callum was 14, 15. He was . very mature. Kids play worse games than that. He was allowed to play . Call of Duty but not other games. He was only allowed a few hours on the . PC. ‘Does that make me a bad parent . because I let him play those games? I banned him from other games where . they slash their throats and stuff, I stopped him playing that, but Call . of Duty I didn’t.’ The court heard the schoolboy had . argued with his parents after repeatedly asking his 13-year-old . girlfriend whether she wanted to have a baby with him. She said: ‘He . kept asking if I would have a kid with him and I said no, I’d only just . turned 13. He said he wanted to get away from home.’ Days before he died, Callum was . grounded by his parents because he had not returned from his . girlfriend’s home until 11.20pm. On the afternoon of his death  he had . been off school with a sprained ankle and had argued with his younger . sister when she came home. A plate had been smashed in the . kitchen and Callum had gone to his bedroom to use his computer, although . his family believed he was only surfing Facebook and YouTube. At around 4.50pm, his mother went upstairs and found Callum hanging by a tie from his bunk bed. Recording an open verdict,  Stockport . coroner Mr Pollard told the family: ‘For whatever reason and it is, I’m . afraid, somewhat mysterious, Callum just decided that he was going to . put the tie around his neck and suspend himself from the bunk beds. ‘Was that with the intention of killing himself or just to give you a shock, we don’t know.’ Miss Green said her son had never given any indication of wanting to harm himself or being unhappy. Teachers at Callum’s school, Audenshaw High, said they could find no evidence that he had been bullied there.

"By . Rebecca Evans and Arthur Martin . UPDATED: . 05:54 EST, 20 January 2012 . Italian police are seeking a ballerina they believe may shed light on the Costa Concordia disaster. Domnica Cemortan was seen cavorting with Captain Francesco Schettino in the minutes before his cruise liner foundered on rocks. Italian authorities believe 52-year-old Schettino – dubbed Captain Coward – may have been distracted from his command by trying to impress the dancer. Scroll down for video . Mystery: Moldovan Domnica Cemortan (left), 25, was on the bridge with captain Francesco Schettino when the Costa Concordia crashed . Domnica Cemortan (centre), as an employee of the cruise ship industry, proudly shows off her certificate of proficiency in maritime safety . Schettino was seen 'drinking' at dinner in the company of Ms Cemortan at about 8.35pm on Friday evening. The picture of her on the right was taken on the bridge of the Concordia . Detained: Captain Francesco Schettino was spotted dining with the blonde woman just 30 minutes before the cruise liner hit rocks . They consider the 25-year-old Moldovan blonde to be a ‘key witness’. Eleven people are dead and 30 missing after the £400million ship came to grief on a rocky outcrop off the Tuscan isle of Giglio. It was carrying 4,200 passengers. Miss Cemortan, who has a two-year-old daughter, had worked as a translator for the Concordia but was on holiday on the ship at the time of Friday night’s disaster. A grainy photograph was taken of her on the bridge. It is thought she might be able to shed light on Schettino’s decision to sail close to Giglio to perform a ‘salute’ for a former crew member and for the ship’s head waiter. Miss Cemortan and Schettino were seen wining and dining together 30 minutes before the disaster. One passenger, Angelo Fabri, said: ‘The captain was in a dark jacket and he was sat in front of the woman – she was quite young and at first I thought it might have been his daughter. ‘She was slim, had blonde hair to her shoulders and was wearing a black dress with her arms uncovered. They were laughing and in high spirits.’ He said the captain was drinking wine – a claim that contradicts Schettino’s assertion that he stayed off alcohol. A source for operator Costa Cruises . said: ‘The woman who appears to have dined with Schettino was a Costa . employee who had been hired to assist Russian passengers. Investigators are probing whether the fear of paying a £25million compensation bill was to blame for the hour delay in telling the Costa Concordia's 3,000 passengers to abandon ship. Every one of the vessel's passengers is in line to receive £8,300 - or €10,000 - payout once an order is made to abandon ship. With so many passengers on board the operators Costa Cruises would have faced a mammoth payout. Officials probing the disaster are believed to be probing whether the fear of compensation was to blame for the delay, The Times reported. 11 passengers have been confirmed dead and 21 people are injured. ‘She was due to disembark from the Costa Concordia before it began its seven-day cruise of the Mediterranean but she bought a ticket and stayed onboard. ‘We cannot confirm or deny that she was on the bridge. To be honest, nobody quite knows what Schettino was up to.’ In an interview with Moldovan newspaper Adevarul, Miss Cemortan admitted being on the bridge on Friday evening and added that ‘he (Schettino) was there’. Italian newspapers yesterday claimed . Schettino has admitted being with Miss Cemortan at the time and that she . was not on the official passenger manifest. Her mother Vera, who lives with her in the Moldovan capital Chisinau, said the seven-day cruise was a birthday present. Yesterday Miss Cemortan defended . Schettino: ‘I know that some of my colleagues should be upset because . they are out of work now and they have debts and have kids waiting for . them but we are all in agreement that the captain did something . exceptional and saved 3,000 lives.’ Wearing protective gear, Ms Cermortan gets to grips with fire extinguishers during her safety course. She confirmed that she did have dinner with the captain, and that she went to the bridge at 11.50pm after the impact - but only to give instructions to Russian-speaking passengers . Initial reports suggested Ms Cemortan (left) may have been on board the ship without proper authorisation. Costa Cruises later confirmed she was an authorised passenger . Prosecutors believe Domnica Cemortan might have crucial evidence on what happened in the moments after the fatal 'sail by' which was apparently carried out by Schettino as a 'salute' to a former captain . Accused of cowardice: Captain Francesco Schettino. Right, Ms Cemortan with a fellow crew member . Divers swim by Costa Concordia's bell off the coast of Giglio . Rescue: Firefighters climb up a ladder on to the Costa Concordia as it lies on its side off the island of Giglio, Tuscany . Race against time: A technician aims a laser scanner at the cruise liner. There are fears impending bad weather could cause the ship to fall off the ledge on which it is resting . Damning transcripts of a phone call . between Schettino and a coastguard have since emerged – revealing his . refusal to return to the listing ship to help co-ordinate the rescue of . hundreds of stranded passengers. Schettino says he deserted the vessel only because he ‘tripped’ and fell into a lifeboat. A transcript released yesterday shows . that – even 45 minutes after striking rocks – Schettino was  telling . coastguards the only help he needed was a tug. He is under house arrest on suspicion of multiple manslaughter, abandoning ship and causing shipwreck. If convicted, he faces 15 years in jail. Impact: A satellite image shows the stricken cruise liner on its side in shallow water . He is barred from leaving the £175,000 apartment he shares with his wife Fabiola and 15-year-old daughter Rossella in the coastal enclave of Meta di Sorrento, near Naples. Yesterday, in a show of local support, a banner was put up outside his home saying:  ‘Captain, don’t give up’. Costa said it had suspended Schettino and launched civil action for ‘significant misbehaviour’. It said he was not receiving any support or legal aid from the company. Operation: Firefighters travel past the vast cruise liner . Despair: Relatives and friends of victims of the cruise liner disaster arrive at Giglio Porto . Divers resumed their search of the Concordia yesterday following a delay caused by the ship shifting position. Susy Albertini, whose five-year-old daughter Dayana is missing, begged them to carry on. ‘Bring her home to me as soon as you can,’ she said. Dayana was on holiday with her father, William Arlotti, 36, who is also missing. Preparations are under way to remove the 2,200 tons of heavy duty diesel in the ship’s tanks – an operation expected to take a month. Experts say sealife would be devastated were the oil to leak.

A young festival goer died from inhaling a single drop of a new synthetic hallucinogenic drug called 25-I at a music festival. Clayton Otwell, from Arkansas, took the small but fatal dosage from a stranger on Saturday night at New Orlean’s Voodoo Experience and went into convulsions 30 minutes later. The 21-year-old with dreadlocked hair was immediately rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was placed on life support, but died on Tuesday. Tragic: Clayton Otwell (pictured), 21, from Arkansas died after inhaling a single drop of hallucinogenic drug 25-I at the Voodoo Experience festival in New Orleans. Otwell's mother, Dayna Duncan, said she hopes justice will be served to the person who gave him the fatal drop. 'I think he needs to be exposed and held accountable for his actions,' she told the Times-Picayune. New Orleans Police Department told the Daily Mail that Otwell’s death is an active investigation and there are no arrests and no suspects at this time. Otwell and a close friend had made a pact never to take drugs from strangers, but Otwell broke that promise after drinking several vodka-Red Bulls, said the friend who was with him at the time. Otwell was among three known people treated for 25-I overdoses during Voodoo Experience weekend, one local emergency room doctor said. Overdose: Otwell took the substance at the Voodoo Experience, where the likes of Jack White (left) played over the course of the weekend . Toxic: Friends of Otwell's said that dealers were passing drops of the drug round during the festival . Friends of all three patients believed that it was their first times taking the experimental drug. A Drug Enforcement Administration agent, Bob Bell, said that 25-I is an extremely potent synthetic substance that the DEA considers comparable to LSD and therefore outlawed in all 50 states. The drug is also referred to as 'N-Bomb' for its chemical composition 25I-NBOMe. New and experimental drugs like 25-I have grown in popularity in recent years partly due to the misconception that they are safe and legal. Exposed: Otwell's mother, Dayna Duncan, wants the drug dealer who sold her son the drug at the weekend-long festival to be brought to justice. File picture . Two teenagers in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and a 16-year-old boy in Sacramento, California, are believed to have died from 25-I overdoses earlier this year, according to DEA officials. Otwell's friends said dealers at Voodoo Experience had been giving out drops of 25-I throughout the weekend-long festival, promoting the drug as artificial acid and artificial mescaline. Voodoo Experience is known for its mixture of local Louisiana performers and high-profile artists, including R.E.M., Eminem, Jack White and Red Hot Chili Peppers. It was first held on Halloween Weekend 1999. In 2007 the festival expanded to three days and broke all previous attendance records with an estimated 100,000 plus fans. A friend of Otwell’s created an online memorial fund to help raise money for his grieving family. Levi Gould, who created the page, wrote: 'Clayton was an amazing son, brother, and friend. His memory will never be forgotten as he will live in our hearts forever. 'He shined his light on so many people and had such a positive influence on anyone he came into contact with. Lets all help to provide support to his family during this tragic time.'

The family of a nine-year-old girl who was raped and murdered in 1970 is fighting to keep the man suspected of killing her in prison - despite all evidence in the case being destroyed decades ago. The murder of Donna Willing in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was never solved and no one has ever been charged. However, Robert Hill, a convicted sex offender who lived down the street of Donna, has confessed to her murder twice. He later recanted both statements and now claims he never killed the girl. He is currently serving the last few months of a ten-year prison sentence for sexually assaulting four children under the age of 10 between 1995 and 2002. Cold case: Donna Willing was raped and murdered at age nine in 1970. Robert Hill, 73, has been in prison for the last decade and has confessed to the killing -- but later recanted . On Monday, prosecutors will argue that a childhood neighbor and . convicted sex offender - who they say confessed to the killing but has . since recanted - should go to trial in the death of Donna Willing. With physical evidence in the case lost or destroyed, prosecutors say . the will argue under the state's sex offender law that Hill, now 73, . is sexually violent and must remain in custody indefinitely. A trial could finally spell the end in a lifelong journey for Donna's sister, Virginia Davis, who has been wracked with guilt about the death of her sister more than four decades ago. Only 4 years old at the time, Davis knew little about the crime. The subject remained off-limits for the next four decades for many in a family that hoped to forget the hurt. But Davis couldn't forget, and after years seeking help to solve her sister's killing, she's preparing to face the man police believe is responsible. Davis says that when she was a child, her sisters would scold her for talking about Donna, warning, 'You don't want to make mom cry, do you?' Most of the siblings don't discuss it even now. But Davis needed answers. At 15 she found the courage to go to the library and read news coverage about her sister's death. Every detail discovered since has helped. Unsolved: Virginia Davis, right, has spent her life helping to track down the man who strangled her sister, center . 'I didn't feel like so lonely, I didn't feel so empty, I didn't feel like I had a million holes anymore,' said Davis, now a mother of three who lives in suburban Milwaukee. 'I just started feeling like it's easier, it's easier, it's easier now. I can talk about her now. I can speak her name.' Davis clearly remembers the afternoon of February 26, 1970. Her big sister Donna was reading to her from a favorite book about animals as they sat on the couch. Her mother wanted Donna to go to the bakery for bread, but Virginia purposely delayed the trip, begging for one more story. 'I remember seeing out the window, it was getting dark and thinking ""Mom won't make her go if it gets dark. She'll send (my brother) or somebody else. She can't go,""' Davis recalls. 'We were afraid of the boogeyman and stuff back then. The boogeyman will get her if she goes out after dark.' Donna walked out at 5.15pm. A witness later saw her get into a green car. Less than two hours later, a man discovered her bruised and bloodied body under a car in his garage about a mile away. Newspaper reports at the time said police had people of interest, but no leads panned out. So investigators in 2008 began interviewing Hill in prison - where he was serving a 10-year sentence for sexually assaulting four children under the age of 10 between 1995 and 2002. Horror: Donna Willing was just blocks from home when she was raped and murdered in 1970 . Hill first told police he sexually assaulted Donna after she got into his car that night, according to court documents. She began to squirm and slapped him. He became angry, afraid she would tell on him. He strangled her and dumped her in a garage. It all took about 10 minutes, he said. In another account outlined in court documents, Hill said he molested Donna for years, picked her up and had sex with her. After she screamed, he put his hand over her mouth and strangled her. Hill, who is now being in held a supervised facility, has since recanted both statements. Balash said Hill knew specifics of Donna's injuries that hadn't been released. Hill's attorney, Robert Prifogle, didn't return a phone call seeking comment before Monday's hearing. Before her mother died in 2009, Davis finally asked why she needed Donna to go to the bakery. Her mother said she wanted to make French toast for dinner. That filled a big hole. This year, Davis met the man who discovered his sister's body - another big hole filled. She said she had blamed herself when she was younger for delaying her sister's trip until after dark, but no more. Davis chokes up when talking about her gratitude for the cold case detectives who pursued the case. 'I want to invent or create a word and I can't come up with anything yet that is the equivalent to how I feel,' she said.","Donna Willing was abducted, raped and strangled on her way to buy bread in February 1970 .

Rebuttal: The Economist ran a feature which irritated French officials because it implied they could bring down the euro . Touchy French politicians yesterday launched  a blistering attack on a prestigious British business magazine after it branded France 'the time-bomb at the heart of Europe'. The front cover of The Economist this week shows seven baguettes wrapped in the red, white and blue ribbon of the French Republic with a lit fuse protruding from the centre. Its lead article says President Francois Hollande's plans to cut France's public debt are not ambitious enough, jeopardising the future of the euro. The magazine, which is seen as supporting the single currency, accuses French leaders of delaying crucial reforms for far too long, claiming: 'You cannot defy economics for long.' In a 14-page special report it explains why France could become the biggest danger to Europe's single currency, adding: 'The crisis could hit next year.' But France's prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, denounced The Economist's cover. He told a French TV station: 'You are talking about a publication which is resorting to excess to sell copies. I can tell you that France is not at all impressed.' French industry minister Arnaud Montebourg yesterday went on to a French radio show to tell of his fury at the article. 'Frankly, The Economist has never been  known for its sense of moderation,' he said. Mr Montebourg said the claims were 'worthy of Charlie Hebdo', a notoriously provocative Paris satirical magazine whose offices were firebombed last year after it published insulting cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad which infuriated Muslims. Mr Ayrault travelled to Berlin on Thursday to explain France's efforts to boost its declining international competitiveness to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The head of France's MEDEF employers' association, Laurence Parisot, also hit out at The Economist's claims, describing them as 'completely exaggerated'. She said: 'In reality The Economist is behind the times because its dossier was concluded before the government decisions to increase competitiveness. 'At the same time, there is some truth in the report, which has France at the heart of Europe, [and] says that if France collapses then the whole of Europe collapses.' France's President Francois Hollande (left) and and his companion Valerie Trierweiler leave the Elysee Palace in Paris . Debate: French President Francois Hollande's reforms are the subject of criticism because they do not stretch far enough . However The Economist's Europe editor, John Peet, defended the publication on French radio yesterday. He said: 'It is a front cover that is . designed to shock – to say that France has some serious economic . problems and must reform its public spending, the public sector and the . labour market. 'It is a shock to encourage politicians to carry out reforms. Not at all impressed: Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault (front row, right) denounced the magazine's angle . 'And I hope that Mr Montebourg will also carry out these reforms.' Socialist Mr Hollande was elected president in May this year. But his popularity has plunged as he . struggles to fulfil promises to reduce France's public deficit while . kick-starting the economy when unemployment has risen to a 17-year high. Meanwhile he has also managed to . antagonise business leaders and entrepreneurs with a string of Left-wing . policies including a 75 per cent top rate of income tax and a reduction . in the pension age. Along with criticism for the lack of . reform, many economists and EU officials are sceptical that France can . hit its target of cutting its public deficit to 3 per cent of output by . 2013. Failure to do so could prompt . financial markets to demand higher rates of interest for Paris . government bonds, which are currently held at rates of around 2 per . cent, as France, along with Germany, is viewed as a safe haven in the . eurozone. France has skilfully manoeuvred itself though the eurozone crisis by maintaining that it is different. By hanging on to the skirts of Germany's Angela Merkel, it has gambled that the world and the financial markets would not notice that it has been slipping ever more deeply into the mire. Francois Hollande, the country's lacklustre Socialist president, swept into office on the back of the dislike of his predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy, and the belief that he could deliver a growth agenda that could restore jobs and repair the financial system. What he failed to recognise was that his country was hugely exposed to its weaker neighbours, had deficit and debt problems as bad as most of its neighbours and a bloated state sector so large it was in danger of exploding. All of this was pointed out earlier this week in an excoriating report card from the Washington-based International Monetary Fund – which paradoxically has a French boss, Christine Lagarde – without provoking much reaction in Paris. But when the shortcomings were featured as the cover story in this week's Economist, under the provocative headline 'The time-bomb at the heart of Europe', Hollande and his ministers went into overdrive. It is one thing being given a scolding by the IMF. It is quite another for 'Perfidious Albion' to question the stability of France's fifth republic. For many businessmen and financiers around the world, having The Economist on conspicuous display is regarded as a status symbol, so a cover suggesting one of the richest nations on the world is in danger of tipping over the edge is bound to have an impact on how France is viewed. The Economist contends that the problems looming in France could dwarf the woes of Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy. The respected weekly magazine argues that the fragility of the French economy has been cruelly laid bare in the eurozone crisis. Many of its firms are uncompetitive because they are swamped by high taxes and mountains of red tape, as well as a notoriously strike-prone labour force. In its analysis, The Economist claims that membership of the single currency has acted as a straitjacket on France because it means the country  cannot allow its currency to devalue. The reality is that France has never gone through the Thatcherite reforms that made the UK so competitive over the two decades leading up to the great financial crisis. France's unique form of economic nationalism meant that whenever it felt the hot breath of competition from overseas, it simply closed ranks to keep the outsiders out. Hollande has not helped since he took over. Instead of shrinking the public sector, he decided to prop up the company and to soak the rich. The decision to raise the top rate of income tax to 75 per cent, the highest level in the advanced world, sent wealth creators scurrying overseas to Britain and friendly climes. The truth is that France is in terrible difficulty. Trapped within the eurozone, it has no means of escaping its woes by devaluing its currency, or adjusting its interest rates or monetary policy that is set by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. This year the French economy already has moved into recession and now the IMF is forecasting that it will grow by just 0.4 per cent next year. Despite its enormous problems the financial markets have tended to give France the benefit of the doubt believing that its commitment to the euro project would allow it to escape the worst of the eurozone's problems. Time for Hollande and his leftist allies in Parliament is rapidly running out and the country could quickly be sucked into the vortex of financial crisis that is destroying social cohesion all over Europe. If that happens it could be the final act for the single currency with Germany and the rich Nordic tier fleeing from what increasingly looks to be a doomed project.","Front cover showed seven baguettes tied up in a tricolour like sticks of dynamite with a lit fuse .

"By . Adam Shergold . PUBLISHED: . 09:28 EST, 19 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:29 EST, 19 November 2012 . FIFA faced another crisis today after allegations the winning bid team for the 2022 World Cup finals secretly offered $1million (£630,000) to the son of one of its executive committee members. The successful Qatar bid team entered into talks with Samson Adamu, 26, the son of the executive committee (exco) member Amos Adamu for a sponsorship deal months before his father was due to vote on the bid, according to documents obtained by the Sunday Times. It is believed that the cash was to be used to fund a lavish . gala dinner just before the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa, despite the . event costing a fraction of the sum. 'Sponsorship': Qatar 2022 bid deputy chief Ali Al-Thawadi is accused of paying $1m to the son of a FIFA executive committee member in exchange for a vote in favour of his bid . Ali al-Thawadi, the deputy chief executive of the Qatar bid, reportedly brokered a proposed deal just six months before his country won the race to host the 2022 finals. However, the proposals did not go ahead. World Cup bidders are banned from offering any incentives to the 24 exco members or their relatives. FIFA - football's world governing body - said it would 'immediately' ask its chief ethics investigator Michael Garcia to investigate the reports. Entrepreneur Samson Adamu spoke at the June 2010 dinner in Johannesburg, assuring a star-studded crowd of African football legends, that his companies had 'no commercial affiliates.' His father Amos was among 300 eminent guests at the free event, who enjoyed a three-course dinner and traditional African music 'to celebrate the achievement of our past football heroes.' It took place on the eve of the 2010 World Cup finals, the first to be held in Africa. However, the Sunday Times claimed to have unearthed documents which suggest that al-Thawadi offered to pay Samson a seven-figure sum to host the dinner and a workshop. It is believed the events cost no more than $220,000 (£138,000). Illegal funds: The payment was made to Samson Adamu, the son of FIFA executive committee member Amos (pictured left) in the build-up to the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa . It came at a critical stage of the bidding process for the 2022 finals, in which the Arab state faced tough competition from the United States, South Korea, Japan and Australia. In a statement, the Qatar 2022 Bid Committee confirmed that there were discussions and an  agreement drafted but they did not pursue involvement in the ‘African Legends Dinner' and no agreement was signed or payments made. They stated: 'Upon due consideration being given to all the circumstances of this particular case - and especially to the relevant FIFA rules relating to the obligations of bid committees - a decision was taken by the Qatar 2022 Bid Committee not to pursue any involvement in the African Legends Dinner.' They add that no member of the Bid Committee attended the dinner. In December 2010, Qatar was surprisingly named as the host for the finals, despite their national team's poor record in international football and concerns that matches would be played in temperatures approaching 50C. Fourteen of the exco members voted for the tiny country in spite of these fears, though the bid has been dogged by allegations of bribery ever since. The Qatar bid committee spent considerably more than the other candidates and FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke admitted in a leaked email that Qatar had 'bought the WC [World Cup]'. He later explained his comments by saying he was referring to the amount of money spent on marketing the bid. Grand designs: The proposed Al-Rayyan football stadium in Doha, one of the venues planned for the 2022 Qatar World Cup . Amos Adamu was also secretly filmed in September 2010 offering to sell his vote for the 2018 World Cup, which went to Russia, for an £800,000 payment into a personal bank account. He claimed he would use it to build football pitches in his native Nigeria. Adamu was also filmed saying that his bid for the 2022 finals was not for sale because it was going to Qatar. As a result, he was sacked from the executive committee, stripped of his World Cup vote and banned from football for three years. Samson Adamu and al-Thawadi first met at the Confederation of African Football (CAF) congress in the Angolan capital of Luanda in January 2010, which was sponsored by Qatar. Five days later, al-Thawadi emailed Adamu asking him for the name of his 'personal company' in order to send him a 'contract and scope of work'. Shortly afterwards, al-Thawadi sent him a draft agreement for the 'Legends of African Football - Gala Dinner - Sponsorship.' Masterplan: The Al-Sharmal stadium in Doha - Qatar's win in December 2010, after beating off stiff competition from the US, Japan, Korea and Australia, stunned the football world . The document states that Qatar would pay Samson's company $1million for 'sponsorship rights' to the dinner and a workshop for African journalists. The draft agreement is between Kinetic Sports Association, a Swiss company that Adamu planned to create, and a 'private institution' in Qatar. It goes on to say this 'institution' was 'bidding to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup... and wishes to acquire certain exclusive rights in connection with the events in order to promote its bid to host the competition.' One of the proposed signatories on this agreement was Qatar bid chief Sheikh bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. After securing the blessing of CAF, Adamu was advised by his Swiss lawyer Daniel Magerle to channel the money through a Swiss bank account to 'add a lot of additional credibility' to the event. However, attempts to create a secretive bank account in the Kinetic name were scuppered by bank UBS, who were wary of the plans. Magerle claimed the deal had fallen through and a planned meeting in London to finalise the agreement had never happened. In attendance: David Dein (left), the former Arsenal chairman and International President of England's failed 2018 World Cup bid, and Lennart Johansson, former President of UEFA, attended the African legends dinner . Adamu sub-contracted the organising of the party to a South African events company called Champions Tours. They were reportedly angered by his complete lack of organisation, with running orders and table plans not confirmed until the last minute. It was attended by six FIFA exco members, CAF executive committee members, the president of UEFA, the European governing body, Lennart Johansson, and David Dein, the former Arsenal chairman. On the original plans for the July 8 dinner, a table had been reserved for the Qatar 2022 bid team, but they didn't show up. FIFA said the documents would be passed on to its top investigator before they decide what action, if any, to take against the Qatar bid. A FIFA spokesman said: 'After receiving these documents, FIFA has immediately forwarded them to Michael J Garcia, Independent ethics committee chairman of the investigatory branch. 'It will be for Michael Garcia to analyse the documents and decide on any potential next steps.'","Qatar bid team allegedly paid Samson Adamu, son of Amos Adamu, $1m (£630,000) to stage a lavish gala dinner in exchange for a vote .

A Tucson police officer shot in the head after responding to a burglary alarm was in critical but stable condition on Sunday following surgery, authorities said. The assailant remained on the loose. Sgt Robert Carpenter was standing with other officers near the home after checking it following a report of a break-in when, just before dawn on Sunday, they heard a loud noise, and he fell, Chief Roberto Villasenor said. Alive: Sgt Robert Carpenter, pictured right, was shot as he and fellow officers investigated a burglary report. Detectives, seen at left, are now in a manhunt for the suspect . He underwent surgery and was able to speak afterward. Police spokeswoman Sgt Maria Hawke said although Carpenter was talking, it was too soon to say if he would fully recover. 'It's very, very early,' Hawke said. 'He came out of surgery and was minimally responsive, which is encouraging, but it's way too early to tell what the long-term effects are going to be given that the bullet struck him in the head.' Police said they did not see anyone in the area immediately following the 5:15am shooting. However, they confronted a man at the scene about three hours earlier when responding to a separate burglary alarm at the same address. The man ran away and escaped. Manhunt: A Tucson SWAT officer is perched atop an armored vehicle as police patrol neighborhoods in Tucson for the suspect who shot Sgt Carpenter . That man is wanted for questioning and may be involved in the second incident. He was described as a 20- to 30-year-old .

New York's emergency services have been heavily criticised for their lack of preparation during Superstorm Sandy as it emerged some of the city's most vulnerable residents could not get through to 911 operators. Emergency lines rang and rang without an answer and those lucky enough to get through were greeted by woefully unprepared operators, the New York Post said today. Others needing urgent help during and after the devastating storm were passed on to the city's 311 non-emergency line, while dispatchers from the police, fire and ambulance services squabbled over which calls were more urgent. Overwhelmed: Devastation in the Rockaway Beach area of New York in the wake of Superstorm Sandy. Emergency services were woefully unprepared for the storm, it has been alleged . Diane Hudson, 45, said an elderly neighbour with cerebral palsy drowned when his Rockaway Park home filled up with flood water because it took hours to get through to emergency services. She said 72-year-old David Gotthelf, who was a wheelchair user, had called Hudson for help when he couldn't get through to 911 himself. 'The first hour or so, I got a busy signal. When [I was] finally able to get through to 911, it would ring for three or four minutes,' Hudson told the paper. 'One time, they sent [me] to a dispatcher who called me back and ended up being in the Bronx [at least a 40 minute drive away].' On another occasion, she was transferred to Emergency Medical Services, which coordinates ambulances, only to be told they don't do rescues. Little left: A pile of debris from damaged homes in Rockaway Park, where disabled David Gotthelf, 72, drowned in his own home after emergency services failed to respond . 'I told them my friend who's disabled was stuck in his apartment, and I hadn't spoken to him in hours. They said, 'We can't really help you because it's not a medical emergency.' 'They obviously weren't trained for this kind of situation. They're kind of reading from a script.' Gotthelf had been logged in their system but his best hope of rescue was by calling 311. Despite Hudson trying both emergency lines until her phone battery died, responders were never dispatched and she found her friend dead the following morning. Other people spoke of being criticised by overwhelmed emergency operators for not evacuating. New York's 911 system typically handles 30,000 calls a day but during the storm on October 29 it received 20,000 calls an hour. The city's 1,400 dispatchers were overwhelmed despite claims the 911 system could handle 50,000 calls an hour. Under the Boardwalk: The remains of the Rockaway Beach boardwalk, which was destroyed by Sandy. Emergency numbers received 20,000 calls and hour during the storm . In 2009, the city spent $2bn on upgrading the system, including a $680m call centre. Earlier this year, a consultant found the city's fire and police department's reliance on having their own dispatchers created a situation where operators often 'wasted time asking duplicative questions and taking identical actions for the same 911 caller' However, New York Police Department spokesman Paul Browne defended the set=up. 'Instead of holding on as instructed by a recording during these peaks, callers hung up and redialled even though the recording cautioned against doing so because it put repeat callers back at the bottom of the queue and furthered overall delays,' he said. 'Despite repeated requests to the public to use 311 for non-emergencies, many still used 911 for non-life-threatening situations.' Superstorm Sandy made landfall on America's east coast at around 6.30pm on October 29, causing 131 fatalities and an estimated $50bn of damage.","Some of the city's most vulnerable residents were unable to get through to overwhelmed 911 operators, while others were referred to non-emergency numbers, the NY Post reported .

Leadership: Midland Mayor Wes Perry speaks during the vigil at Centennial Plaza . Four veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan were killed and 16 more people were injured when the train crashed into the flatbed truck in West Texas. It was the second of two floats carrying veterans in Thursday's parade in Midland. The first was exiting the tracks when the warning bells and signals were activated, 20 seconds before the accident, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The second float did not enter the tracks until several seconds after the warning system went off, the NTSB said. By that time, the guardrail was lowering.

Valiant: Sgt Maj William Lubbers, 43, left, was . taken to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries along with Sgt . Maj Joshua Michael, right . 'Once the crossing becomes active, people should stop,' lead investigator Robert Accetta with the NTSB said at a news conference on Saturday afternoon. The timeline was pieced together by combining information from a video camera mounted on the front of the train, another one on a sheriff's car and a data recorder that acts like an airplane's black box, activating when the train blared the horn, NTSB member Mark Rosekind said. Nine seconds before the crash, the train sounded its horn, a blaring that lasted four seconds, according to Rosekind. The guardrail hit the truck, then the engineer pulled the emergency brake, trying to bring the train that was travelling at 62mph to screeching halt. People on the first float and dozens of others who had come out to greet the veterans shrieked and watched in shock, as some aboard the truck tried to jump off, witnesses said. The veterans' military instincts kicked in as they treated the wounded. 'Heroes on Board': This is a shot of the tragic parade float just moments before it was wrecked and destroyed by a train . Devastation: A train smashed into this flatbed trailer carrying dozens of veterans and their spouses on Thursday evening . The NTSB has also interviewed the engineer and conductor, and established the train's air brakes were working, Mr Rosekind said. No mechanical problems were found with the cars. A review of the train's maintenance history found no defects, he added. The tracks also had no problems. Investigators will try to establish on Monday what the engine could have seen as it approached the truck. Part of the investigation includes whether the parade had the proper permit. The parade has been an annual event in Midland for nine years, but City Manager Courtney Sharp declined to say whether the group, Show of Support/Hunt for Heroes, had the necessary paperwork to hold the event. Railroads are a vital part of Midland, a town that sits in the heart of Texas' oil rich Permian basin. Three or four tracks lie within city limits, and the site of the accident is just about 10 minutes from downtown. 'We take all steps into consideration when we permit,' Mr Sharp said. 'I hate to go down that track until all of the investigation is over, but yes we do take that stuff into account.'

Charles, from Leicester, launched his . attack shortly after midnight while jostling for space at the event's . free bar after Jessie J had finished her performance. The killer had been talking to a girl . and asked Mr Sheriff for some space. He replied: 'She doesn't want to . be talking to you. She'd much rather be talking to me, wouldn't you, . love?' After pushing and shoving between the men, Charles grabbed the older man's bottle of beer before swinging it at his neck. In a statement to the court, Mrs . Sheriff, whose children are aged five and eight, addressed Charles . directly, saying: 'You took an amazing man away from us so brutally and . no one will forget that. I spent four days watching my husband die. 'I was with him when his body turned blue and he took his last breath. I will never forget that.' Charles, who had no previous arrests or convictions, is a Loughborough University graduate who worked at a design agency. Judge Worsley said of the bottle: 'It was a lethal weapon. He was a decent man.' He added Charles had done something 'which was truly out of character'. Tragedy: Phillip Sherriff was murdered after the Jessie J gig . Addressing Charles he added: 'You did not deliberately smash the bottle you used. I . am satisfied you did not intend to kill Mr Sherriff and you were . immediately remorseful.' Mrs Sheriff has started a campaign, named . Bottlestop, to ban glass bottles from late-night city centre bars in the . wake of her husband’s death. A petition set up in her name . attracted the 100,000 signatures necessary to trigger a debate in . Parliament just days before Charles’ trial began. She and her two children, aged five and eight, are still being treated for post-traumatic stress brought on by the death and she has been unable to return to work. ‘The children are wary of me going back because daddy went to work and never came back,’ she added. Mr Sheriff had travelled from his home in Preston, Lancashire, to attend a party organised by his employers BlackBerry on April 3. He was due to stay the night at the nearby Holiday Inn Express in Southwark and according to witnesses he was ‘completely in control of himself’ even though he had been drinking. Charles was working at the Leicester-based Form Studios design agency, where he oversaw the production of websites, print products and phone apps.

Callum . had won tickets to the party in a prize draw organised by the handset . firm and invited Loughborough University graduate Charles and other . friends along. The group headed to the gig after checking into the Belgravia Rooms Hotel in Victoria, central London. Experts say the bottle was broken before it hit Mr Sheriff’s neck, possible on a metal stand nearby. ‘Whether or not the bottle was broken . deliberately there is no question he chose to thrust the bottle into . the neck of the man who irritated him,’ said Mr Penny. ‘The effect of his actions were obvious to all. The severing of the carotid artery resulted in immediate and copious bleeding.’ Partygoer Tim Chase, one of 1,500 guests, described the sound of the bottle strike as ‘like a plastic glass being hit.’ ‘I saw a massive gash in the victim’s neck with blood streaming out of it,’ he said. ‘I . put my hand on it, putting pressure, but no matter what we did it . didn’t stop so I stuck my fingers in the hole in his neck and that’s . what stemmed it.’ Star of the show: Singer Jessie J - pictured as she entered the building - performed for guests at the event . Devastated: Jane Sherriff, widow of Phillip Sherriff, at the Old Bailey . Mr Chase was later commended by the judge and awarded a £250 reward for his actions. Another reveller, Mark Weyman, then asked the bar staff for some clingfilm. He said: ‘I administered first aid by tying plastic around the victim’s neck to stem the flow of blood.’ Mr Weyman had earlier tackled Charles to the ground moments after the attack on Mr Sheriff. ‘He . was heading towards me, he had a complete look of panic on his face,’ he said. ‘I was in no doubt the guy staggering away had assaulted the . guy who was bleeding. ‘I . grabbed the suspect and got him to the ground. The bouncers approached . me and I explained the guy I was holding had just bottled the other . guy.’ Another partygoer who . witnessed the attack was Laura Taylor, a journalist for the Press .

I instinctively flapped out and slapped him.’ He . insisted he had not broken the bottle beforehand and suggested it must . have struck something else before it connected with Mr Sheriff. Asked if he had intended to injure Mr Sheriff, he replied: ‘Absolutely not. I was unhappy. I was devastated. ‘I didn’t intend to harm him and I could see he was hurt.

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 10:32 EST, 19 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:08 EST, 19 November 2012 . Accused: The alleged victims say Derick Crawford is not the man who attacked them . A man charged with brutally raping two British women in separate attacks on the island of Barbados is innocent - say the victims he is accused of assaulting. Academic Rachel Turner, 30, and grandmother Diane Davies, 63, say police have ignored their insistence that accused Derick Crawford, 47, is not the man who attacked them in 2010, and claim officers were more concerned with protecting the tourism industry in Barbados than with finding the real culprit. Both women have waived their automatic right to anonymity in order to make their objections public, over fears the same fate will befall other tourists visiting the island. University researcher Dr Turner will be watching from the public gallery when local man Crawford appears at a preliminary hearing at a Barbados magistrates' court tomorrow. Retired primary school teacher Mrs Davies is equally adamant Crawford is not responsible for her violent attack, and that her rapist is still at large. The Bajan man's defence is being funded by former actress Hilary Heath, 66, who was herself raped on the island eight years ago. Dark side of paradise: Mrs Davies was dragged from a path near this beach in exclusive Holetown, Barbados . Mrs Heath, who formally complained about the lacklustre police response to her case, had also taken the decision to waive her anonymity to claim authorities were doing nothing to warn women of the threat of sex attacks on the island, and were failing to properly investigate them when they did occur. Dr Turner moved to Barbados to take up an environmental research post at the University of the West Indies two years ago. As she walked along a narrow path to the beach on a Saturday afternoon in October she was set upon by a man who dragged her into a deserted hotel building, raped her, and then fled. Just two days later widow Mrs Davies, who was enjoying a holiday alone on the island, was dragged from the same beach path and raped in an identical attack. She was left with a broken collarbone and ribs. But the victims cannot take any . solace in the fact a man has been charged with the crime, because they . are certain he is not the guilty party. Neither Dr Turner nor Mrs Davies recognised Derick Crawford when they were shown his photograph by police. 'When I heard him speak I just knew . then it definitely was not him. His face is all wrong and his voice is all wrong,' Dr Turner told The Independent. Both women say Crawford is significantly older than their attacker, who they independently identified as being in his thirties. 'They have made no effort to find him. That is the crux of the matter,' Mrs Davies told the newspaper. Savage: Diane Davies, seen left after being attacked on Barbados, and right at home on Anglesey, North Wales, is convinced Derick Crawford is not the man who dragged her into a deserted hotel and raped her . Mrs Heath, who is now an addiction . counsellor, moved to the island 10 years ago to take up a post at Verdun . House, a charitable foundation working with drug addicts that are . released from prison. She was asleep at her home on the island in April 2004 when she was raped at knifepoint by a masked intruder in a savage attack. Mrs . Heath said she had to beg for DNA swabs to be taken when she went to . hospital after the attack, that officers failed to gather vital . evidence, and that a senior police shouted and laughed at her during a . meeting. Her attacker, . Venslow Small, was eventually captured after leaving his phone at the . scene of another crime. He went on to be convicted of raping Mrs Heath . and 16 other women. The . former actress, who waived her anonymity after learning of Mrs Davies' horrific ordeal on the island, said: 'When I heard about Diane's case I . thought ""My God, they have done nothing"".' Support: Former actress Hilary Heath (pictured with ex-husband Duncan Heath) formally complained about the police investigation carried out after she was raped on Barbados in 2004 . Mrs Heath also described the timing of Crawford's arrest shortly after she spoke to the press about her concerns regarding sex attacks on Barbados as a 'strange coincidence'. The Barbados Police Complaints Authority has said Mrs Heath's case had been investigated and that a response would be send to her shortly. Both Dr Turner and Mrs Davies have written to the Commissioner of Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions to complain about the handling of their cases. Police Commissioner Darwin Dottin has confirmed that the two women had contacted authorities, but added that it was 'utterly wrong' to suggest that the country's reputation was given priority over the welfare of visitors.

Justice minister Helen Grant is claiming £1,666.67 per month for a flat in London, even though she lives within commuting distance of the capital . A Government minister who lives only 19 miles from the Commons is claiming taxpayers money to fund a second home in London. Justice minister Helen Grant today defended the arrangement in which she lives in a £1.8million home in Reigate, Surrey – outside her Maidstone constituency- but also rents a flat on the bank of the Thames. She is allowed to claim expenses on the flat - near the MI6 building in Vauxhall - because her constituency is considered too far to commute from the capital. But Reigate, where she lives, is not far enough from London for the constituency MP - Tory Crispin Blunt - to make similar expenses claims. Mrs Grant’s expense claims will be revealed in a documentary tonight, which will also show how more MPs than first thought are claiming rent on a second home while letting out a property they own nearby. Last month it emerged 27 MPs were renting out homes they owned while claiming expenses on a different property. But Channel 4’s Despatches will say at least 32 MPs have entered into the same arrangement, which is allowed under new rules imposed after the expenses scandal which banned claiming for mortgages from the end of August. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority will today publish details of the landlords of 300 MPs, against the wishes of Commons speaker John Bercow. At least four MPs are thought to be renting homes to each other. Some have suggested the complex arrangements are the unintended consequences of the system put in place after widespread abuse of the expenses system was uncovered in the last parliament. As part of the reforms, only MPs who have constituencies outside London can claim second home expenses. But the rules do not state that the MP has to live in their own constituency. Mrs Grant, who was promoted to the Ministry of Justice in the September reshuffle, lives in Reigate which is considered too close to London to have a second home in the capital. But because she is MP for Maidstone she is claiming £1,666.67 per month - the maximum allowed within the rules, which caps rental claims at £20,000 per year. Mrs Grant has filed claims for rent since March this year. Mrs Grant's taxpayer-funded flat is on the bank of the Thames, near the MI6 headquarters in Vauxhall . A spokeswoman for Mrs Grant said today: ‘Mrs Grant's constituency has been deemed by IPSA to be a non-London constituency and she is therefore fully entitled to use her rental accommodation allowance either in London or in the constituency. ‘She has a base in her constituency at her mother's property, where her son also lives, so she sees no need to rent a further property there. ‘The focus of her time and responsibility has always been Maidstone and the Weald.’ But campaigners accused Mrs Grant of breaking the spirit of the rules designed to protect taxpayers’ money. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: ‘Helen Grant's arrangements certainly appear to be against the spirit of the rules. The taxpayer-funded allowance for a second home is meant to be there for MPs living in a constituency home from which they cannot reasonably commute to Westminster on a daily basis. ‘Most people would expect that by choosing to remain living in her Surrey home - which is a commutable distance from London - Mrs Grant would have made herself ineligible to make these claims. This is a loophole in the rules which ought to be closed. However, IPSA insisted the arrangement was in order. A spokesman said: ‘We set the rules up based on the constituency the MP represents. We provide support for one of those locations to help with renting a flat. ‘Ultimately it comes down to the MP's judgment about what they need to claim for. We don't check to see what private assets an MP has.’","Tory qualifies for a second home allowance because she is MP for Maidstone in Kent .

Abuser: 15-year-old Ben O'Neill raped an elderly man while high on the drug MCAT and drunk on vodka . A 15-year-old boy has been jailed after raping a disabled male pensioner while 'out of his own mind' on a cocktail of vodka and the drug MCAT. Ben O’Neill pushed his terrified victim, 65, into a field before attacking him, forcing him to perform a sex act on him and then attempting to rape him again. His elderly victim was unable to fight back as he suffers from a condition which restricts the use of his limbs, Nottingham Crown Court heard. The judge took the unusual step of naming and releasing a photo of the teenager because of the seriousness of the crime. O’Neill was jailed indefinitely for 'public protection' but must serve at least three-and-a-half years behind bars after a judge heard the drunk and drug-crazed teenager had subjected his victim to the sickening ten minute assault on August 4, saying 'We’re going to have some fun together.' He pleaded guilty to three serious sexual assault charges, plus two charges of robbery and charge of theft. Hours earlier, O’Neill and an accomplice had been involved in the robbery of a mobile phone from a 24-year-man. The robbery occurred on the site of the old Sherwood Colliery when the pair, who were part of a larger group, followed the 24-year-old. The first male - who was never identified - hit the victim around the head with a bottle before O’Neill grabbed him in a bear hug. The victim fell to the floor and was kicked unconscious, although he recalled O’Neill ordering the other perpetrator to stop because the victim was disabled. The victim later woke up and realised his mobile phone and keys were missing. The next morning, O’Neill was part of a group who entered Cox’s Supermarket in Mansfield Woodhouse at around 6.30am, with O’Neill stealing a bottle of vodka. Around 90 minutes later and still carrying the stolen vodka, he approached the disabled 65-year-old victim near an allotment site, before escorting him to a field. O’Neill made the man perform a sex act on him as well committing rape and attempted rape. Following the ordeal, O’Neill asked the man if he had any money on him and took his mobile phone before throwing it away. He then ordered him lay down until he had left the area. Shocking: Nottingham Crown Court heard how the teenager forced himself on the 65-year-old who could not fight back because of his disability . O’Neill then went to a house in Vale Road in which he knew the occupants, but stole a laptop a short time later. In the process he left the vodka bottle behind. He was later arrested and initially denied the charges until forensic evidence was found on the vodka bottle. At least one person a week dies after taking mephedrone, which until two years ago was legal. Yet . despite the dangers the drug, Known as 'plant food' or 'mew meow', has . been hugely popular because of its cheapness and easy availability. It is now a class B drug. In 2010 clubbing magazine Mixmag christened mephedrone 'the UK's favourite new drug'. Used as a replacement for ecstasy or cocaine, it is sold on hundreds of internet sites for around £10 a gram. And unlike cocaine, it is unlikely to be cut with baking soda, paracetamol or more dangerous substances. Buying . it online with your credit card is straightforward and avoids any . contact with drug dealers or the danger of a run-in with the law. A . survey for the magazine found four out of ten of those surveyed had . tried it and a third had taken it within the previous month. One in six . said they took it every week. It is most often snorted in powder form but can also be obtained in pills and capsules. Side-effects . include headaches, palpitations, nausea, high blood pressure, a burning . throat, nose bleeds and purple joints, especially the knees and hands. Defending, Adrian Langdale said O’Neill had a difficult upbringing and was physically abused as a small child by his mother’s former drug-addicted partner. He had gone to live with his grandparents which Mr Langdale said were 'the only stable force in this life', but he was eventually diagnosed of suffering from ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) at the age of 13 and put on medication to combat the illness. Mr Langdale said in the six months leading up to committing these crimes, he had begun to take the mind-altering class-B drug MCAT, was smoking cannabis and drinking. Mr Langdale said: 'One can only guess what it did when it was mixed with ADHD. It was in that state of mind that he committed these offences. He was in no way in his own mind and is shocked, disgusted and sickened by what he did.' He also argued that the motive behind the sexual offences was not for sexual gratification, but rather to degrade and humiliate the victim. This was agreed by Judge Milmo. The judge jailed him for three years and four months for the robbery, rejecting the claim that it was not premeditated after arguing O’Neill and his unnamed assailant had followed the victim. He then jailed him for three years and eight months for the three sexual offences. He said he must serve at least three-and-half years in total, and would only be released when he was deemed no longer a risk to the public. He must also sign the Sex Offenders Register for life. Judge Milmo said: 'I can’t form a reliable view that an extended detention would achieve the protection of the public from serious harm.' Detective Constable Tony Lee, from the Mansfield Rape Team, said: 'The men O’Neill attacked continue to have problems to this day and the impact his violent and cruel crimes had on them cannot be understated. 'O’Neill had been drinking vodka and taking Mcat during his two-day crime spree, which had a significant impact on his behaviour. The alcohol and drugs was a recipe for disaster, and innocent people paid the price. 'He will have to live with what he’s done, and the pain and suffering he’s caused, for the rest of his life. I hope that today will signal an end to this incredibly painful chapter in the lives of his victims and they can at least take some comfort in the fact that he’s had to answer for what he did.'","The 65-year-old victim could not fight off Ben O’Neill because of his disability .

Costly mistake: Donald Junior Green leaving Oldham Magistrates' Court today where he admitted possession of class A drugs . A drug user who mistakenly handed bags of cocaine instead of sweets to a police officer's children out trick-or-treating was spared jail today. Apprentice panel beater Donald Junior Green fished in his pockets for a bag of Haribo sweets to give to the youngsters but instead pulled out a plastic pack containing eight snap bags of cocaine he had bought for £200 earlier that day, Oldham Magistrates' Court heard. He dropped the drugs into the goody bags carried by the three children, aged eight, six and five, who were out playing trick or treat, escorted by their father, an off-duty policeman. The 23-year-old defendant then closed the door, went back inside the house and put his hand in his pockets to get out his drugs - but instead pulled out the Haribo sweets. Green immediately realised what had happened and went on foot, then by car, scouring the streets of Oldham to find the youngsters. But the officer, PC Simon Fowell, had taken his children home and, as they emptied their goody bags to share the spoils, he spotted the drugs - and made a swift call to his on-duty colleagues. Green, who had never been in trouble with police before, has a job and attends college, wiped his eyes with his hands as he stood in the dock and admitted a single charge of possessing a Class A drug on October 31. Green, of Sycamore Avenue, Oldham, was given a 12 month community order, ordered to do 130 hours community work and told he must pay court costs totalling £145 by chair of the bench Joyce Cooper. Earlier Sean Brady, prosecuting, told the court Green was at his girlfriend's house in Mendip Close, Royton, on Halloween night when the incident happened. The defendant had earlier that day bought £200 worth of cocaine, divided it up into snap bags and put it in his trouser pocket. His girlfriend had also bought some small bags of Haribo sweets which they had been handing out to trick-or-treating youngsters that evening. Mix up: Green meant to give the children some Haribo sweets but gave them cocaine instead . When PC Fowell's children approached, Green put his hand in his trouser pocket, pulled out what he thought were Haribo sweets and dropped them in the goody bags they were holding. Mr Brady told the court: 'Mr Fowell and the children thanked the defendant. That was their last call of the evening and they decided to go home - the children were soaked to their skin.' Back home the children went up to their bedroom to share out the sweets when their father popped in and spotted the 'treat' from Green. 'He asked his daughter where this item came from. She said it was from the last call,"" Mr Brady told the court. Meanwhile, Green had realised his mistake. More than they bargained for: PC Fowell's children went trick or treating in Oldham where Donald Junior Green gave them bags of cocaine instead of sweets by mistake . Mr Brady added: 'Once he's gone back inside and put his hand in his pocket again and instead has pulled out a pack of Haribo and immediately realised what he had done. 'He then drove around the area trying to locate the children.' When Green answered the door to police who arrived to arrest him. he told them: 'I know exactly why you are here. I knew you were coming.' Mr Brady said there was a 'wry' side to the case but the consequences could have been very serious. 'Had dad not have gone in and recognised what it was, this could have been a very serious case.""Steven Sullivan, defending, said Green had initially acted out of 'public spirit' by giving out sweets - but that had gone badly wrong. 'This was an accidental act. It was grossly foolhardy,' he said. 'It took him only a matter of minutes to realise his error. 'This is clearly a highly unusual and unfortunate case. Not surprisingly it has attracted a good deal of adverse publicity. 'He has been embarrassed by the publicity but does not seek to feel sorry for himself.'","Donald Junior Green handed cocaine over instead of Haribo sweets .

Lord Walton of Detchant said older peers would be willing to stand aside, if they were given a 'retirement gratuity' Elderly peers are offering to retire from the House of Lords - but only if they get a huge pay-off equivalent to a year’s expenses. The extraordinary proposal is being actively discussed in the corridors of Parliament. It even appears to have the backing of a Tory Cabinet minister, after Lord Strathclyde revealed he is keen to create a ’retirement scheme’. Under existing rules, peers are not able to retire from the House of Lords. The only way the number of people sitting eligible to sit on the red benches can be reduced easily is if they die. There . are around 770 peers able to sit in the House of Lords. One in five is . over 80 and around half are over 70 years old. Some 20 per cent have . been in the Lords for more than 20 years. With scores of new appointments made by successive governments, many of whom are comparatively young, numbers have ballooned. Now . peers are openly discussing the idea of older members being eased out, . but only if they are handed a bounty worth potentially more than . £40,000. Lord Walton of Detchant said: ‘A . number of noble Lords of mature years have indicated that they might . consider the possibility of honourable voluntary retirement given an . incentive— say, in the form of a retirement gratuity equivalent to the . expenses that they had claimed in the previous year?’ The House of Lords has swelled to some 760 peers, with an average age of 69 . Peers are able to claim £300 for each day . they attend. With the house sitting for around 145 days a year, it means . they could claim up to £43,500. Lord . Walton warned that without a golden goodbye, elderly peers would not be . persuaded to step aside. ‘Some have indicated that, in the absence of . such an incentive, it is likely that they would continue to stay in the .

Tory Cabinet minister Lord Strathclyde said he was open to the idea of peers being able to retire . But Tory Cabinet minister Lord Strathclyde encouraged those wanting a pay-off to retire from the red benches to come forward. Around 40 peers have died since the general election, he said. ‘It is likely that we will lose a similar number between now and the next general election. I have heard it whispered in the corridors that the House is increasingly keen to debate and discuss some form of retirement scheme, including an age limit. I very much welcome all those who wish to come forward with such thoughts.’ Lib Dem peer Lord Steel introduced a Bill earlier this year which would allow peers to retire. It would also anyone who had been to jail from returning to the red benches and give authorities tougher powers to suspend members. But so far it has not been backed by the government and stands little chance of becoming law. Instead, two Tory peers jailed for expenses fraud are back in the Lords, and claiming public money again. From April to June Lord Hanningfield, the former Conservative leader of Essex county council, received £8,481. And Lord Taylor of Warwick claimed £2,100 for seven days in June.","Lord Walton says 'mature' peers would be willing to quit the red benches for a 'retirement gratuity'

Prisoners caught using Facebook on smuggled mobile phones will be stripped of their perks or have time added to their sentence, it emerged tonight. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has ordered ‘serious disciplinary consequences’ for any convict who posts pictures of themselves on social networking sites. It follows revelations by the Mail that hundreds of prisoners - including notorious killers - are using Facebook to taunt their victims from behind bars. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has ordered 'serious disciplinary consequences' for any convict who posts pictures of themselves on social networking sites. This picture was posted on Facebook and shows prison inmates posing for the camera . Inmate Paul Gallagher posted on a friend's Facebook wall while still in prison . In the last two years nearly 350 inmates have been discovered posting on the social networking site while locked up. Prisoners are banned from accessing the internet but get online using mobile phones smuggled into their cells. Mr Grayling said: ‘Prison is not meant to be a comfortable place, full of perks and undeserved privileges. ‘Those offenders who smuggle mobile phones into prisons and take pictures of themselves and their fellow inmates purporting to be having an easy time should take heed – they will face serious disciplinary consequences.’ The most likely punishments are to remove the privileges enjoyed by inmates, such as having a television inside their cell. Prisons also have powers to add extra days to the length of time an inmate must serve. In a separate move, it emerged ministers are planning to remove Sky TV from jails. Currently, inmates serving time in privately-run institutions have access to the perk. Insiders say it is likely to be banned as part of a wide-ranging review of privileges being conducted by the Prisons Minister, Jeremy Wright. Inmate Gary Hyland posted this picture of inmates at Haverigg smoking in a cell on a Facebook profile set up in his name. Under it he posted: 'F**k it am out in 2 weeks' The Mail has highlighted a string of cases of criminals using Facebook from behind bars. They include Jade Braithwaite, who was jailed for life for the murder of Ben Kinsella. The 22-year-old wrote 'I'm down but not out' and said he wanted to 'delete people'. He was jailed for life following the knife attack in London in June 2008. The postings were read by Ben's family who said they were 'appalled' and disgusted and the messages were an 'insult to Ben's memory'. The killer Ryan Herbert, who murdered 20-year-old Sophie Lancaster in 2007, was found to have sent more than 100 messages using the site. He sent flirtatious messages to female friends and also posted pictures of himself posing with other inmates in the prison gym. In another case, a teenage boy who killed a shopkeeper posted a series of pictures on Facebook showing him making 'gangster salutes'. Martin Grant, who posted this picture as his profile image taken in a recreation room at HMP Haverigg . Liam Ryan, 19, was jailed for life for the murder of Birmingham shopkeeper and Suppiah Tharmaseelan. He was part of a gang which attacked the father of four after he fought back when they tried to steal alcohol. The pictures, apparently taken from inside his Young Offenders' Institution cell, show Ryan making an obscene gesture at the camera. They also show the piles of junk food in his cell and his personal television set and games console. And eight men posted a mock holiday snap of themselves posing shirtless at HMP Haverigg in Cumbria. The inmates even likened their prison sentences to a holiday in Spain. Crackdown: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling says any convict caught posting pictures of themselves on social networking sites faces 'serious disciplinary consequences'. Ministry of Justice figures released after a Freedom of Information request show 199 Facebook profiles were taken down between July 2010 and June last year. Another 143 profiles were removed between July 2009 and June 2010. All were removed by Facebook following an investigation by prison officials. The crackdown emerged in a wide-ranging speech by Mr Grayling, who promised a ‘rehabilitation revolution’ inside Britain’s jails. He announced education in young offenders' institutions will be dramatically improved to stop the ‘travesty’ of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money being spent on detention for 'little gain'. Mr Grayling said some teenagers were costing up to £200,000 a year to look after - five times the bill of sending them to a top public school like Eton - but most reoffended. He also confirmed plans to recruit ex-offenders to act as mentors to newly-released criminals.","Justice Secretary Chris Grayling says any convict who posts pictures of themselves on social networking sites faces 'serious disciplinary consequences'

A debt-ridden civil servant forged his elderly neighbour's will and then bludgeoned her to death with a claw hammer so he could inherit her house. Peter Smith, 48, was today jailed for life for the brutal murder of housebound widow Hilda Owen, 71, at her home in Skegby, Nottinghamshire, in February 2007. Just two days before the attack Smith - who the court heard was 'mortgaged to the hilt' - had prepared a will for frail Mrs Owen which bequeathed her entire estate to him. Guilty: Peter Smith, 48 (left), was found guilty of murdering his frail neighbour Hilda Owen, 71 (right), at her home in Skegby, Nottinghamshire in February 2007 . It is the second time Smith has been convicted of Mrs Owen's murder - he won the right to a re-trial after being found guilty by a jury in 2008. He will serve a minimum of 27 years. The former Department of Work and Pensions employee - who befriended his neighbour by running errands for her and helping her with shopping - had admitted preparing a will for Mrs Owen just two days before the widow was attacked. Smith, who had outstanding debts of £35,000, had denied getting her to sign the document and later filling in details in her absence in order to make himself the sole beneficiary. After falsifying Mrs Owen's will, Smith attacked the widow - who was rendered housebound by arthritis. Police were alerted when Smith pretended to discover her body two days later. He had scattered items around the room in an attempt to fool police into believing Mrs Owen had been attacked by a burglar. The 71-year-old was found with 48 injuries consistent with the use of a claw hammer and a screwdriver. Blood stains found at the scene indicated the woman had been struck from behind while sitting in a chair and then attacked on the floor. Scene: Smith pretended to find Mrs Owen's body two days after he had savagely killed her at her home in Skegby . Prosecutor Peter Joyce QC told the jury Mrs Owen had been 'a defenceless, elderly, disabled woman who was killed by Smith for her money and her possessions'. Nottingham Crown Court heard he had claimed grants for Mrs Owen and posed as her carer in order to collect £240 a month in benefits. After the hearing, Nottinghamshire Police Detective Superintendent Paul Cottee said: 'Once again, a jury has found Peter Smith guilty of the brutal murder of Hilda Owen. 'The evidence against Smith in terms of motive, his behaviour prior to Mrs Owen’s murder and his movements on and immediately after the day of her murder was overwhelming. 'The collation of that evidence is testament to excellent policing work to categorically identify Smith as the person who planned the killing of Mrs Owen in order to benefit financially from her death,' he added. Det Supt Cottee said the re-trial process meant the victim's relatives again had to endure hearing details of the ordeal she suffered at the hands of her killer. 'However, they can now be assured that the man who murdered her has been returned to prison, where he will remain for a very long time,' he said. Defenceless: Mrs Owen was discovered with 48 injuries inflicted with a claw hammer and a screwdriver . Mrs Owen’s family said in a statement: 'We are very pleased that the jury has returned a guiltyverdict so that, once and for all, we can be rid of any uncertainty that lingered over Smith’s original conviction following his appeal. 'Hopefully this verdict will bring an end to this devastating episode in our lives' Statement from Mrs Owen's family . 'We respect his legal right to have sought these proceedings, but it has again been a very upsetting time for us all. We have been put in the very unusual position of having to endure two trials which have both reached guilty verdicts against the same man for the same crime. 'Hopefully, this verdict will bring an end to this devastating episode in our lives.' Mrs Owen's neighbours told of their shock at learning she had been murdered by her neighbour. Geoff Shirley, who ran the village shop in Skegby, said: 'I thought Smith was the bee's knees. 'I thought he was ideal for Hilda, that he was a caring, good neighbour. I felt utterly betrayed when it turned out as it has. I was devastated. 'I honestly thought ""how could anyone have done that to Hilda?"" She was so frail.'","Peter Smith, 48, attacked his elderly neighbour with a claw hammer and a screwdriver at her home in Skegby, Nottingham, in 2007 .

Pupils as young as 11 will be able to gain a qualification in ‘body image’ in a new initiative to tackle hang-ups about size and weight. The YMCA has developed a course for secondary school pupils aimed at building ‘confidence and self-esteem’ and reducing anxiety about appearance. Youngsters completing the qualification - targeted at 11 to 14-year-olds - will receive an award at the same level as a D to G grade at GCSE. Backing: The course is supported by Team GB Olympic weightlifter Zoe Smith, who suffered abuse on Twitter over her body shape . Self-esteem: Smith said that many young girls were put off playing sport because of insecurities over their body . The course - which could be offered in schools next year - involves eight to 10 hours of study and includes tasks such as ‘give an example of a positive and negative portrayal of bodies in the media’. The YMCA, which runs its own exam board offering qualifications in health and fitness, said the body image course aimed to help youngsters ‘build a more positive body image’ and a healthier lifestyle. But critics said schools were being bombarded with social issues to tackle in lessons and warned that the qualification could undermine time available for core academic subjects. One teacher took to Twitter to ask: ‘Anything else you’d like us to teach? We’ve got LOADS of free curriculum time.’ The initiative follows a report earlier this year from the All Party Parliamentary Group on Body Image which called for children to be given ‘body image and self-esteem’ lessons. Children as young as five worried about their size and appearance, it said. Most people were dissatisfied with their body image and one in five had been bullied or victimised because of their weight. The new course is backed by teenage Olympic weightlifter Zoe Smith, who has suffered vile Twitter abuse over her muscular appearance. ‘Sports and exercise are one of the best ways of feeling good about yourself, but so many young people still feel uncomfortable about taking part, often because they are worried about what they look like,’ she said. New course: The YMCA qualification in body image will be aimed at 11-to-14 year olds and is aimed at building 'confidence and self-esteem' Plans for the course have been submitted to exams watchdog Ofqual for approval. It is intended to be taught in PSHE (personal, social and health education), free study periods or youth clubs. Draft lesson plans show the course will be split into two parts, one aimed at giving children an understanding of body image and the other focusing on exercise and healthy eating. Pupils will be required to complete a workbook, produce a website article, book onto sessions of different activities and make a healthy packed lunch . The YMCA said nearly one in six young people have said they would rather be thin than healthy. The qualification would help stop health and well-being being ‘equated with a particular body shape’.","The YMCA course is aimed at building 'confidence and self-esteem'

A low-end clothing dealer was arrested Wednesday in the killings of three Brooklyn shopkeepers, police said. Salvatore Perrone, 63, of Staten Island, confessed to two of the killings after turning himself in to police, according to the New York Post. 'He puts himself at all three scenes,' a source told the Post. 'The motive is still unclear.' Scroll down for videos . Is this 'John Doe Duffel Bags'? Salvatore Perrone, a businessman from Staten Island, has been named in connection with the Brooklyn murders . Before police knew his . identity, the suspect was dubbed the 'John Doe Duffel Bags' for the bag . that he was seen carrying the most recent attack, which . was visible in surveillance videos. Perrone carried clothing in the duffel bag, which he had tried to tried to sell to the shopkeepers, police said. Police recovered a bag containing a . sawed-off rifle believed to have been used in the killings. The other . killings happened in July and August. All three shopkeepers were men . alone in stores that had no video cameras. After being questioned by detectives . for hours, Peronne admitted to the slayings of Mohammed Gebeli, 65, . in Bay Ridge and Isaac Kadare, 59, in Bensonhurst. Weapon: Police say that Perrone used this rifle to kill three New York shop keepers . In the most recent killing, . Rahmatollah Vahidipour, an Iranian, was shot three times in the head and . chest at his store, the She She Boutique. After that killing, detectives . discovered the same gun was used in the fatal shootings of two other . shopkeepers when ballistics matched the .22-caliber gun shell casings on . all three. On July 6, Gebeli, an Egyptian, was found shot in . the back of his shop, Valentino Fashion Inc. On Aug. 6, Kadare, . also Egyptian, was shot in the head in his store, Amazing 99 Cent Deal. The suspect was taken into police custody after he voluntarily entered the 68th Precinct in Bay Ridge. He was . later transferred to another police location for additional questioning. Revealed: The balding, mustachioed man dubbed 'John Doe Duffle Bags' who was seen near at least two crime scenes in Brooklyn voluntarily submitted himself for questioning Tuesday . Ballistics tests matched in each killing, all of which occurred in Brooklyn shops with an '8' in the address. Peronne was caught on surveillance footage a block and a half away from the Flatbush store where Rahmatollah Vahidipour was killed on Friday evening. Minutes later, the same moustachioed-man is seen in a different video two blocks away from the store. Murdered: Vahidipour Rahmatollah was killed with three gunshots, but it seems nothing was stolen . The New York Post reports that a different surveillance camera, located by the scene of the second murder in Bensonhurst also shows the same man. The video is of poorer quality, but they feel confident that the same duffel bag-toting man was in the area around the time that shopkeeper Isaac Kadare was killed on August 2. ‘”John Doe Duffel Bag” wore a long overcoat and carried a duffel bag,’ police commissioner Ray Kelly said. ‘He was seen in the vicinity of Vahidipour’s store just after 6 p.m. The shop owner’s body was found at 7.11pm.’ This is not the first person-of-interest in the case, and a number have since been ruled out. Previously unidentified suspects, dubbed ‘Jane Doe Green Jacket’ and ‘John Doe Bubble Jacket’, were on the police’s watch list since they were seen in the area of Vahidipour’s shop at the time of the murder. They have since been eliminated from the suspect pool as it turns out that ‘Green Jacket’ stole a bottle of perfume from street vendor ‘Bubble Jacket’ who was chasing after her following the theft. Two remaining possibilities are ‘Jane Doe Long Coat’, a woman who was seen near the crime scene wearing sunglasses and a scarf. Looking for the man: He appeared near at least two of the three crime scenes over the past four months . Near the scene: None of the stores where the shootings took place had video cameras inside . There also was a police sketch released following the first murder that took place earlier in the summer at a 99 cent store that left Mohammed Gebeli dead on July 6. That possible suspect was a man with . dark skin and wearing sunglasses, who witnesses described as being . ‘disturbed’ and talking to himself about putting a bullet in someone’s . head. That man is said to be roughly 5-foot-5 and around 140 pounds. The Daily News reports that the shop owner Vahidipour of Great Neck was behind the counter of She She in Brooklyn's . Flatbush section when he was shot Friday night. The gunman . dragged the victim's body toward the back of the store and covered it . with clothing. Victims: Isaac Kadare and Mohammed Gebeli were killed by the same handgun earlier this year . Police found the 78-year-old with two gunshot wounds to the head and one to the torso, DNA Info reported. On . the floor of the shop were the killer's calling card: shell casings . matching casings left at the scenes of the last two homicides. 'Now it's like he's telling us, 'It's me again,'' a police source told the New York Daily News. casings that police have matched to two other murders. “Now it’s like he’s telling us, ‘It’s me again,’ ” a police source said. The way Rahmatollah's body was hidden was also consistent with the previous shootings. On July 6, Mohammed Gebeli, 65, was found shot through the neck in his Bay Ridge clothing shop. His body was also hidden. Police believe the methodical killer does this to buy himself more getaway time by delaying the discovery of the bodies. 'I hope they catch the son of a b****,' Gebeli's son, Mourad said. When Rahmoatollah didn't come home at the usual time Friday his family called the police, who discovered his body. It wasn't not clear if the killer actually took anything, or if the murder was his sole motivation. 'He never had in his whole life one enemy, he didn't have, he was a very . kind man,' his sobbing wife, Naima Rahmatollah, told reporters. Suspect: Following one homicide at a 99 cent store that used the same gun, police released this sketch of the suspect . He was supposed to be at his grandson’s Bar Mitzvah on Saturday. Police believe the murderer had been . watching the store in preparation for the attack, noting that he'd . chosen a shop with no security cameras. Issac Kadare, 59, was found dead in his Bensonhurst store at 1877 . 86th St., was shot in the head and stabbed in the neck. Besides owning stores, each victim was of Middle Eastern descent, prompting suspicion the killer could be racially motivated. It appeared nothing was taken from Rahmatollah's shop but both Kadare and Gebeli had money taken from them, and it remains unclear whether robbery is a motive. Unguarded: believe the killer was attracted to the store because, as with previous crime scenes, there were no cameras . Fernando Mateo of the Bodega Association of the U.S. said they were sending copies of the police sketch to their members but were mostly concerned with those fitting the previous victim's description. 'The only members that we would be concerned about are Middle Easterners,' he said. It's also possible the killer has a fascination with numerology, as the address for each homicide includes the number 8: Kadare at 1877 86th St., Gebeli at 7718 5th Ave., and Rahmatollah at 834 Flatbush Ave. None of the stores had working surveillance cameras. Scene: Police believe the killer may have been casing the shop, as it had no security cameras to catch him in the act . Neighbors called Rahmoatollah a 'neighborhood staple.' 'He was a regular guy,' said customer Xanius Patterson. 'He never hurt nobody.' Police are offering $12,000 for any information leading to the killer's arrest and conviction.

Five runaway boys seeking shelter and warmth in China on a cold night died from carbon monoxide poisoning after lighting a fire inside a rubbish bin, it emerged today. The Tao boys - all brothers or cousins aged 9 to 13 - had been missing for more than a week when they lit the fire last Thursday in Bijie, south China, about 15 miles from their home in Caqiangyan. The five boys were the sons of three brothers - two of whom are migrant workers with jobs far from home - and most of them had largely unsupervised lives in the care of their blind grandmother. Pictured: Zhonglin, 13, Zhongjin, 12, Zhonghong, 11, Chong, 13, and Tao Bo, 9, (unknown order) had been missing for more than a week when they lit the fire last Thursday in Bijie, south China, 15 miles from their home . As details emerged of the tragedy, which happened on the day China unveiled new leadership with promises of a better life for all, it touched off fresh soul-searching about social responsibility. It renewed concern over ‘left-behind’ rural children often left with grandparents while parents seek work in thriving coastal cities, and the failure of China’s social services to adequately care for them. ‘Though you departed from us in a garbage bin, you are not garbage,’ children's book author Zheng Yuanjie wrote on his blog, adding that the fault lies with ‘adults who failed their responsibilities.’ The boys - Zhongjin, Zhonghong, Zhonglin, Chong and Bo - were found in a 5ft-by-4ft rubbish container in Bijie after a night of drizzling rain when temperatures were about 4C (40F). Two of the fathers were said to be rubbish collectors in Shenzhen, a boom city near Hong Kong. One of the mothers lives in Shenzhen and another reportedly left the family. The third brother and his wife are Bijie-area farmers, but were said to have often left the boys to fend for themselves. Scene: The boys were found in a 5ft-by-4ft rubbish container in Bijie after a night of rain when temperatures were about 4C (40F), in a case that has shocked China and prompted concerns over 'lost children' Former journalist and Bijie resident Li Yuanlong posted online that the children had been spotted living in a temporary shelter with plastic cloth, bricks and plywood at a nearby demolition site. Questions were raised about how the children went missing for 10 days without more of an effort launched to find them. Six local officials, including two school principals, were sacked on Tuesday. 'Though you departed from us in a garbage bin, you are not garbage' Zheng Yuanjie, children's book author . ‘We have failed in our management work,’ said Tang Guangxing, a spokesman for Bijie city, where the boys' bodies were found on Friday. ‘Our work was not attentive enough.’ State media outlets have joined in. ‘This is a shame that cannot be washed away by a civilised society,’ the Beijing Youth Daily wrote in an editorial. The boys had poor grades at school and essentially dropped out of classes, reported Xinhua News Agency, which faulted China's education system for putting too much stress on academic excellence. ‘Please do not forget the mission of compulsory education. Please spread love and responsibility like sunshine,’ Xinhua wrote in an editorial. Close-up: The runaway boys seeking shelter and warmth in China died from carbon monoxide poisoning inside a rubbish bin after lighting a fire there on a cold night . ‘This is also a tragedy of “left-behind children”, which is a sign of the time and requires introspection from family, society and government.’ Many critics in China have fretted over decaying public morality as the country's economy rapidly grows and its people enjoy unprecedented wealth. 'We have failed in our management work' Tang Guangxing, Bijie city spokesman . A similar outcry erupted last year when a toddler in Guangzhou was run over by two vehicles and then ignored by at least 18 passers-by. The latest incident has focused concern on the plight of families in impoverished rural areas. An estimated 58 million children countrywide lack sufficient supervision or stay in the care of grandparents when their parents seek work in China's booming cities. Some details of the boys' home life remain unclear. Bin: The boys were the sons of three brothers - two of whom are migrant workers with jobs far from home - and most of them lived largely unsupervised in the care of their blind grandmother . Their relatives lack telephones, but some were quoted by Chinese media outlets who sent journalists to the extremely poor, mountainous region of mud huts where farmers earn about £300 a year. 'This is a tragedy of ""left-behind children"", which is a sign of the time and requires introspection from family, society and government' Xinhua News Agency . Li, who broke the story on the deaths in . an online posting, said that local officials in Bijie were not pleased . with the coverage and that police there told him to leave the city for . four or five days. Some observers have faulted the family for not keeping closer watch over their children. ‘How could grandparents take care of your child when you are away?’ asked Beijing parking attendant Liang Hongjin, a migrant worker from Henan province. However, much of the criticism has been directed at the government and educational system. Communist chief: The boys died hours after Xi Jinping gave his first speech as China's new leader in Beijing's Great Hall of the People last Thursday . The family reported the boys missing . November 5. Beijing lawyer Li Fangping said the failure of local . officials to launch a proper search was ‘horrific’. The boys died hours after Xi Jinping gave his first speech as China's new leader in Beijing's Great Hall of the People. 'Our people have an ardent love for life. They want their children to have sound growth, have good jobs and lead a more enjoyable life' Xi Jinping, China's new leader . Xi underlined the Communist Party's mission to improve the country's education, employment, social security, housing and health care. ‘Our people have an ardent love for life,’ Xi said in the speech. ‘They want their children to have sound growth, have good jobs and lead a more enjoyable life.’ The boys' death reflects a systematic failure of children services, Beijing Normal University social welfare expert Wang Zhenyao said on state-run China Central Television. The system lacks shelters, social workers and volunteers, and there is poor communication with those in need, he said. ‘That's a blank in China,’ he added.","Outcry following shocking case that saw Tao boys aged 9 to 13 found dead .

But in reality the career criminal, . who had 74 previous offences on her record, spent the cash on drugs, . leaving Mr Girt with virtually nothing and at his 'lowest point'. He . was forced to move out of his home and in with his daughters. A judge at Preston Crown Court yesterday jailed Greaves for three years and two months after she admitted six counts of theft. In . a statement read out to the court, Mr Girt told how the heartless . criminal had changed his life. 'I was at my lowest point,' he said. 'I am a proud man from a generation who doesn’t ask for help. I had to swallow my pride and ask my daughter for help.'

She got herself into his affections, firstly visiting and . spending time with him and thereafter, developing a relationship with . him.' Callous Sharon Greaves was jailed at Preston Crown Court for swindling an old man out of thousands of pounds . Detective Constable Marc Armstrong, who led the investigation, said: 'It’s had a devastating impact on him and his family’s lives and Greaves has shown no remorse for what she did. 'It isn’t just the financial loss, the main thing to him is the loss of his independence, because he has had to move in with his daughters. 'He had lived in Blackpool for 11 years and enjoyed where he lived but it’s all been taken away from him because he thought he had found someone he could spend his last years with.' Greaves sobbed in the dock as her barrister Peter Horgan described her long struggle with drugs. He said: 'For 20 years she has struggled with a drug addiction. In recent times she has lost the support of her husband which had an impact upon her.'

Evidence emerging from a trial at a school in Birmingham suggests that pupils who are on the autistic spectrum learn better from the automatons than human teachers. And researchers say that if they can be proven to help difficult to reach youngsters, then in the future they could also be used to help pupils in mainstream classes. Topcliffe students Daniel and Kaleem play with one of the state of the art robots: Evidence is emerging that suggests autistic children learn better from robots than human teachers . Max and Ben, two knee-high humanoid robots that can dance to Thriller, play games and emulate Tai Chi, have been helping pupils at Topcliffe Primary School in Castle Vale since March. Ian Lowe, headteacher at Topcliffe, where about a quarter of the pupils are autistic, said the robots had been 'brilliant' at supporting children with their learning. He told the BBC: 'The robots have no emotion, so autistic children find them less threatening than their teachers and easier to engage with.' Topcliffe is a mainstream primary school that gets specialist funding to cater for autistic youngsters in separate classes using a range of technologies. With the help of the University of Birmingham, the school is trialling the robots as classroom buddies for autistic pupils in an initiative that aims to improve social interaction and communication. Research shows that children with autism often find computers and technology safe, motivating and engaging, particularly in the areas of social interaction and communication. The robots, which cost around £15,000 and were donated by their French manufacturer Aldebaran, are the latest in a range of innovative technologies that the school has been experimenting with. The robot dances for Daniel: The machines, which cost £15,000 each and were donated by French robotics firm Aldebaran, can dance to Thriller, play games and demonstrate Tai Chi . Robots might soon be able to use tools like MacGyver to solve complex problems by improvising with whatever everyday items they can find. A U.S. Navy funded research team are working on an automaton that can mimic the resourceful creativity of the Eighties TV hero to escape from sticky situations. Robots are increasingly being used to explore hazardous environments. But if one was trapped in a burning room by a jammed door, it couldn't work out how to use nearby objects to climb over debris, pry open the door and escape. A research team led by Professor Mike Stilman at the Georgia Institute of Technology hopes to change that by giving robots the ability to use objects in their environments to accomplish high-level tasks. 'Our goal is to develop a robot that behaves like MacGyver,' he said, adding: 'We want to understand the basic cognitive processes that allow humans to take advantage of arbitrary objects in their environments as tools. 'We will achieve this by designing algorithms for robots that make tasks that are impossible for a robot alone possible for a robot with tools.' Dr Karen Guldberg, from the University of Birmingham’s School of Education, said: 'We have been looking at how technology can support pupils with autism to communicate more effectively. 'Pupils and teachers are experimenting with the robots and other technologies in a developmental way and they are showing significant benefits for the classroom. 'The robots have been modelling good behaviour and acting as buddies.' Speaking to the BBC, she added: 'It is amazing to see how engaged and focused they can be when they are working with the robot. It can be very difficult to get children with autism to focus.' Autistic children in particular find the technology predicable, but a well thought out programme could also work in mainstream classes, Dr Guldberg added. Mr Lowe added: 'The robots have been brilliant at supporting autistic children with their learning. You can program them to teach language, play games and model behaviour. We have even used them in assemblies. 'In the future we are looking to see if they can be used to support learning not just at school but at home as well.' The pupils are also taken with the tiny androids. Seven-year-old Joshua told Sky News he likes playing memory games with the robots, while Daniel and Khalim say they like to watch their electronic buddies dance. Teachers told Sky News the fact that the normally reticent youngsters are so keen to discuss the robots shows their value in bringing autistic children out of their shell.","Two humanoid robots have been trialled with autistic pupils at a Birmingham school since May .

The biggest penguins alive today: An Emperor Penguin stands on sea ice near McMurdo Station, Antarctica. They can reach heights of 3ft 11in tall . A penguin that stood taller than most men waddled across the southern hemisphere millions of years ago, scientists say. Argentine experts have discovered the fossils of a 6ft 6in (2m) tall penguin that lived in prehistoric Antarctica 34million years ago. Paleontologists with the Natural Sciences Museum of La Plata province, near the capital Buenos Aires, said the remains were found on the icy southern continent. 'This is the largest penguin known to date in terms of height and body mass,' said researcher Carolina Acosta. The modern day record is held by emperor penguins, which reach heights of about 3ft 11in. Lead . researcher Marcelo Reguero added that the find will 'allow for a more . intensive and complex study of the ancestors of modern penguins.' The . previous record for the tallest prehistoric penguins had been held by a . five foot tall bird discovered in Peru two years ago and nicknamed the Water King. The Water King, . which lived more than 36million years ago, was found by a Peruvian student in the Paracas Reserve on Peru's eastern coastline. Like . the latest find, it lived at a time half way between the end of the . dinosaurs and the modern day when the Earth was much warmer than now and . when when gigantic prehistoric birds and mammals roamed the world. As the UK divorce rate continues to soar, a new study has today shown how marital harmony is thriving in the penguin world. Research has revealed a pair of Magellanic penguins as among the most faithful in the animal kingdom. The couple have remained loyal to each other over a 16-year period, in spite of spending thousands of miles apart during their winter trips. The findings come after a 30-year study of the breed where researchers placed metal identity bands on the flippers of 50,000 birds on the southern coast of Argentina. But unlike the Antarctic bird, and their modern day descendants, the flightless bird lived in the tropics - where it dived into warm seas using a seven-inch long spear-like beak to hunt for fish. In its next expedition to Antarctica, during the region’s summer, the Argentine team will hunt for more fossils of the newly discovered species. They hope to gather more information about its anatomy and how the giant penguin might have moved. All the giant penguins that once roamed the prehistoric earth died out, leaving behind the smaller varieties which are today found only on the Antarctic. Previous finds from prehistoric penguins indicated they did not sport the iconic black and white feathers the birds are known for today, but had reddish-brown and grey plumage.","Palaeontologists discovered fossils of the flightless bird in Antarctica .

Andrew Stevens, 30, was banned from driving for three months after being filmed by police doing wheelies on his 1,000cc Yamaha and hitting speeds twice the legal limit. Today, police released some of the two-and-a-half minute video to highlight the dangers of speeding. Scroll down for video . Dangerous: Andrew Stevens reaches speeds of 160mph on his powerful 1,000cc Yamaha bike as he is tailed by an unmarked police officer . Yet road safety campaigners have criticised Stevens' ban as too lenient and say it does not act as a deterrent. Motorcycle . journalist Stevens, who writes for website Visordown, admitted he . had made a 'stupid mistake'. But he claimed to be speeding because he was . 'euphoric' at the time as he had just proposed to his girlfriend . and she had accepted. He . was followed by a police officer on an unmarked bike along Seven Mile . Lane, near Tonbridge, in Kent, where he twice reached speeds above . 100mph before peaking at 160mph when he drove onto a dual carriageway. Stevens also performed a wheelie as he overtook a lorry at about 50mph and again as he accelerated towards 100mph. Sorry: Motorcycle journalist Stevens held back tears as he told court he made a 'stupid mistake' and vowed never to appear before them again . He fought back tears as he told Sevenoaks Magistrates' Court: 'I made a stupid mistake. 'This was going to be the last year I ever had a bike like that. It’s a shame it’s ended this way. You will never see me again.' Prosecutor James Nichols said: 'The . defendant took off at 128mph in the 50mph (zone). The road was clear, he . slowed down to just below 100mph when he came to the brow of the hill. 'He got slowed up in traffic. He shot off towards the Hop Farm towards Paddock Wood and got up to a speed of 160mph.' The . court heard that when Stevens was pulled over by PC Townsend, from . Kent Police Tactical Operations Group, on June 27, he told the officer: . 'I am such an idiot. I am a journalist. 'I was doing a test drive. I can't believe I did that.' However, . during the hearing on October 26 David Barton, defending, tried to . blame the officer for not pulling Stevens over sooner. He said: 'He stayed behind him for about two-and-a-half minutes during which time the very high speed was reached. 'One will never know why the officer simply did not stop him for speeding. He could have done.' He added Stevens was so happy because his girlfriend had agreed to marry him and set their wedding for 2014. VIDEO: Andrew Stevens twice drove over 100mph before reaching a speed of 160mph . Mr Barton said: 'It is a very powerful machine which he was perfectly capable of driving safely. There is always the potential for something to go wrong. 'He did not know he was being followed by an unmarked police bike.' Stevens, from Tonbridge, pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention. As well as the ban, he was fined £500, ordered to pay £85 prosecution costs and a £15 victim surcharge. The sentence was met with anger from road safety groups. Caroline Derrick, chair of safety . campaign group Tunbridge Wells Is Traffic Aware, said: 'Where is the . deterrent?

Acting Head of Roads Policing, Chief Inspector Paul Sellwood added: 'I would like to reassure all those that use the roads responsibly that our unmarked bikes and . cars are there for their safety, and they have nothing to fear from them. 'If caught committing an offence you risk a fine, driving ban and potentially losing your job or a sentence of imprisonment. 'More than this, think abut the consequences to yourself and your family of being involved in a serious collision. You could kill or maim yourself or someone else. 'All too often we see the devastating effects of careless and dangerous driving or riding on those involved and their families.

A grandmother was left stranded in Spain after easyJet banned her from flying - for 'touching' an attendant's arm 'to get her attention'. Janet Kirby, 62, was barred after the airline claimed she 'assaulted' the staff member by twisting her arm as she queued to board at Murcia airport. But mother-of-two Mrs Kirby, who has two grandchildren, insists she did no such thing and is furious at her treatment, claiming the airline also banned her for life, which it denies. Mrs Kirby, from Stroud, Gloucestershire, said: 'To be accused of assaulting somebody just for touching them is absolutely ludicrous. Mrs Kirby, pictured left with her grandson Finley and husband Michael, says she was barred from EasyJet and ordered off a plane after touching a flight attendant on the arm . 'I couldn’t believe the way they reacted, the way they treated me was appalling. I have travelled all over the world and I have never been treated or spoken to like that in my life.' The row started when Mrs Kirby was told her hand luggage was too big and needed to go in the hold. She says when she tried to argue her case she she was ignored repeatedly, so she touched the handler's arm to get her attention. The staff member summoned a supervisor, who promptly banned Mrs Kirby from the flight. The grandmother, who was meant to be . flying home to Bristol with sister Carol, said: 'We had paid for . priority boarding so we should have been among the first to get on the . plane but when we arrived at the gate there was only one queue. Grandmother Janet Kirby, 62, was left furious after easyJet stopped her from flying to Bristol from Murcia, Spain, over an alleged assault . 'By . the time we got to the front the attendant stopped us and said ‘You, . you wait there’. She said our bags were too big to fit in the overheard . lockers and would need to be checked in. 'Carol started to panic as she had a lot of important paperwork with her and didn’t want to let it go. 'She . just kept ignoring us but the whole time she was allowing other . passengers to board the plane with bags much larger than ours and we . could see them going across the tarmac with their cases. 'I tried to get her attention by touching her arm and she said, ""Do not touch me. You are not flying"".' Mrs .

Twisted: Alberto Sierra, 28, has confessed to the murder of his wife and two stepdaughters in Florida . A husband confessed today to suffocating his wife and two stepdaughters, authorities said. Alberto Sierra, 28, also admitted that he had raped eight-year-old Julia Padrino and her mother Gladys Sierra, 29. He then murdered them along with the youngest girl Daniela Padrino, four, at their Miami home. Sierra had gotten into a fight with his estranged wife on November 10 while they were driving to a Florida mall with the two girls. Alberto Sierra pulled out a knife and 'harmed' Mrs Sierra, according to a police report. Miami-Dade Police did not describe her injuries from the argument. Sierra then took the woman and her daughters back to the house in a Miami suburb, where he locked the girls in a bedroom and forced Gladys into the master bedroom. He then suffocated her with a plastic bag and sexually assaulted her. Sierra later suffocated the young sisters with a plastic bag and sexually assaulted the eldest. Police said one of the girls was sleeping when she was suffocated. The girls are not the defendant's biological children. Police say Mrs Sierra's six-year-old son was safe with his grandmother. Sierra was charged with three counts of first-degree murder and sexual battery on an adult and on a child under 12. It is unclear if he had retained a lawyer. A neighbor found the bodies of Mrs Machado and her daughters last Tuesday afternoon at their home after smelling a foul odor. After searching the premises, the neighbor found the three bodies inside the master bedroom closet. Sierra, a convicted felon who was recently released, turned himself in to Miami police the following night. Tragedy: Glays Sierra, left, was found murdered in her home alog with her two daughters, eight-year-old Julia, center, and four-year-old Daniela, right . Little princesses: The 29-year-old had Julia, left, and Daniela, with her ex-boyfriend, Michael Padrino, who is also the father of her six-year-old son. The boy was not present during the murders . In October 2011, Sierra was . investigated after one of his stepdaughters said that her . stepfather had bitten her arm, the Miami Herald reported. ‘I do believe their lives are in danger,’ the girls’ biological father Michael Padrino wrote at the time. Padrino asked a judge to award him sole custody of the children, but his request was denied. Records show that Sierra was . accused of domestic battery of his wife in October 2010. According to an arrest report, the . two had a ‘heated argument,’ and Sierra bit his then-girlfriend on the left forearm, stole her gun and drove off. ‘The only way you’re getting this gun . back is to shoot me,’ he told her before escaping, according to the . report cited by the Herald. Mystery: Gladys, pictured with her daughter Daniela, wrote a cryptic message on Facebook on Friday night . Two months later Sierra, who described himself as a marble worker, was arrested . for drug and weapon possession. The man admitted to police that he had . stolen a 9-mm Smith & Wesson pistol and ammo during a burglary. In June 2011, Sierra was sentenced to . a year of probation, but within two months he was re-arrested for . driving, even though he was listed as a ‘habitual traffic offender'. Machado . and Sierra were married in October 2011. The following month, police . investigating a burglary came to the couple’s Flagami home, where . they found two guns. Sierra . was charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and his . probation was revoked. He later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 364 . days in jail. He was released on June 22. Danger: Mrs Sierra had a violent fight in her car with her estranged husband before her death, a police report said . Doomed: Gladys worked as an administrative assistant for the Beauty Schools of America .

Hundreds of copies have already been snapped up, with each month showing the imposing Victorian buildings which became home to schizophrenics, epileptics and the feeble-minded.

Eccentric: Kevin Beresford has previously released calendars featuring roundabouts, pictured, roadkill and prisons . Many former asylums have been converted into homes, such as the former Napsbury Hospital in London Colney, Hertfordshire . Victorian asylums were hailed as places of refuge for some of society’s supposedly most vulnerable men and women. These buildings were called ‘lunatic asylums’, and later renamed ‘mental hospitals’. They earned a reputation as dehumanising, prison-like institutions. Before asylums,the burden of keeping vulnerable individuals rested almost entirely on loved ones. ‘Mad’ people who could not be kept at home wandered free, begging for food and shelter. A growing market economy in the 1600s and 1700s saw ‘service professions’ emerge. Those who worked in them did thankless jobs formerly handled at home or by the church, and included undertakers, private tutors and ‘madhouse-keepers’. Families paid for secrecy and discretion, and private ‘madhouses’ left few records. Artefacts show keepers used physical restraints such as leg-irons and manacles. Public funding poured into asylum construction between 1800 and 1900. The patient population in England went from about 10,000 to 10 times that. Asylums built in this period impressed public officials, as the buildings were designed to be majestic and therapeutic. Extraordinary attention was paid to ventilation and to safety, and most asylums also featured extensive grounds. Expensive but inflexible buildings became overcrowded, and by 1890 the majority of patients left only in coffins. Techniques such as straitjackets, seclusion and sedative drugs such as bromides were used on unruly patients. In the first half of the 1900s asylums (or ‘mental hospitals’) became testing grounds for controversial treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and lobotomy. These methods helped some patients function again, but they irreparably harmed others. Many mental hospitals closed in the 1970s and 1980s. This was due to pressure from the anti-psychiatry movement, feminist criticism, ex-patient activism and political suspicion of large, unaccountable institutions.

A killer who threatened to show his 'dark side' during his trial for two brutal murders has been jailed for at least 37 years. James Allen beat 81-year-old Colin Dunford to death in his Middlesbrough home and murdered Julie Davison, 50, in a horrific stabbing attack at her flat in Whitby. The 36-year-old killer, who had just 96p in his bank account, deliberately targeted the victims, who both lived alone, so that he could take their money. James Allen, who killed twice, was jailed for at least 37 years today after he was convicted of two counts of murder . Allen was on the run for a week after the first killing while both Cleveland and North Yorkshire Police drafted in more than 100 officers to hunt for the violent fugitive. He was eventually arrested in Leeds by an off duty police officer who spotted him on his way to work. During a four week trial at Newcastle Crown Court Allen, of Middlesbrough, denied he was responsible for either killing but bizarrely told jurors he would confess to one of the murders if prosecutors could produce any solid evidence against him. While giving evidence from the witness box Allen branded prosecutor Robert Smith 'boring' and said the case against him was a 'joke.' He used foul and abusive language to both the judge and prosecutor and even threatened to show his 'dark side' when asked questions about his late mother. Julie Davison and Colin Dunford, were attacked by Allen, who showed 'no remorse' for his crimes . After less than four hours deliberation jurors found him guilty of both murders. Mr Justice Openshaw gave Allen two life sentences and said he must serve at least 37 years before he can even apply for parole. The judge told him: 'These were murders of exceptional brutality and savagery. 'You have shown not the slightest remorse.' Prosecutor Robert Smith QC told the court Mr Dunford was killed on April 22 and Miss Davison met her violent death three days later. Mr Dunford’s battered body was found by Angeline Dicicco who had gone to the pensioner’s home with a group of friends who had become worried when he did not turn up for his nightly pint at the local social club. Ms Davison’s body was found by her sister Dawn Kibble who had become worried when she could not get in touch with her. James Allen, pictured on the Scarborough to Leeds Coastlliner, went on the run after he mercilessly killed two people so he could take their money . James Allen, pictured here in Baxtergate with Julie Davison's laptop bag, was hunted by police after the crimes . Mr Smith told jurors: 'The two of them had no connection with each other and there is nothing to suggest they knew each other or had contact with any person who knew them both. 'It is the prosecution’s case that they were each murdered by the same man, despite the distance between their homes and the differences in their personal circumstances. 'The motive for their deaths in each instance was robbery. 'Each of them was brutally attacked within their homes, the contents of which had been ransacked and the person responsible, having regard to the degree of violence used, could have intended nothing less than their deaths. 'After each of them had been murdered the person responsible left the home of each of them, locking the door behind them using the victim’s key.' The court heard Mr Dunford, a frequent visitor to his local supermarket and social club, was described by those who knew him as somebody you could 'set your watch by' and lived a routine, safety conscious life. It is thought he was killed in the hours after he got home from visiting a friend’s home on April 22 and his body was found by his worried friends the following day. Allen, caught on camera here in Sports Direct, Scarborough, threatened to show his 'dark side' during his trial . James Allen, pictured here in Cash Generators, Scarborough, said the case against him was a 'joke' Mr Smith said: 'Colin Dunford died as a result of blunt injuries to his head and face caused by multiple, forceful impacts to his face and head, resulting in multiple abrasions, extensive bruising, lacerations and extensive fracturing of the bones of the face. 'A substantial number of the blows he sustained to the head must have been in the form of kicks and stamps, while some may have been due to punches.' Miss Davison was 'physically vulnerable' and had been disabled by a painful degenerative disease which she took pain relief medication for. The 50-year-old, who also suffered from epilepsy, was last seen by a friend who left her home in the early morning of April 25 and was found dead in the flat by her sister and brother-in-law three hours later. She had also been beaten and kicked. Both of the victim’s homes had been ransacked and searched by the killer.

A Tory MP has claimed he would not care if fellow backbencher Nadine Dorries was eaten by a snake while taking party in I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here. Gordon Henderson condemned her decision to abandon Westminster for a month to appear on the ITV show, and said she should be representing her constituents. Ms Dorries was suspended from the Tory party after jetting off to the jungle without getting permission from David Cameron. Nadine Dorries, the Mid Bedfordshire MP, angered Tory colleagues and constituents after jetting into the jungle . During the Bushtucker Trial, Rotten Rhymes, Nadine Dorries had to eat ostrich anus and camel toe . She angered colleagues and . constituents with her claim that she would use her appearance to promote . politics, including discussing lower the abortion time limit. Instead . viewers have watched her eating ostrich anus and performing a woeful . stand-up routine with Linda Robson from Birds of a Feather. Mr Henderson, the MP for Sittingbourne . and Sheerness, was asked about her appearing on I'm A Celebrity... Get . Me Out of Here! at a youth surgery at Sittingbourne Baptist Church. He said: ‘I don't approve of what she's . doing. I think Members of Parliament are elected to represent their . constituents and you can't do that from a jungle in Australia.' As MPs prepared to return to the Commons this week, Ms Dorries was in the jungle performing a woeful comedy routine with Linda Robson from Birds Of A Feather . He went on: ‘If she was swallowed by a python and . never came back to Westminster I wouldn't lose too much sleep over it,’ the Kent Messenger reported. ‘If she wanted to connect with people . she should have talked to people face-to-face. I don't have to go to . Australia to do that.’ Bookies have made Ms Dorries favourite to be voted out of the show. Tory MP Gordon Henderson told a meeting of young people he would not care if Ms Dorries did not return to Westminster . Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes said: ‘Nadine's as popular with punters as she is with the Conservative party and the odds suggest her time in the jungle is up.’ Ms Dorries will face a showdown with Chief Whip Sir George Young when she returns to the UK.'It will be a meeting without coffee,' said a senior Tory source. The MP for Mid-Bedfordshire triggered a storm of outrage when she jetted off to the jungle for a month when she should have been in Westminster. Earlier this week one of her Ms Dorries' daughters insisted she was cleared to take part in I'm A Celebrity by former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell before he resigned last month. Jennie Dorries told ITV's Daybreak that Mr Mitchell agreed that her mother could take the time off. She said: ‘She did ask for the month off. The chief whip gave her permission. She did all she had to do before she left. She made arrangements for someone to take her place on Remembrance Sunday.’ But Mr Mitchell is adamant that no conversation was had about being away from Parliament for a month, and certainly not to be a contestant on the ITV show fronted by Ant and Dec. ‘Conversations between the Chief Whip and colleagues are confidential,’ a spokesman for Mr Mitchell said. ‘But in this case Andrew is happy to confirm that permission to go to Australia for one month to take part in I’m A Celebrity was neither sought nor was it given.’","Gordon Henderson insists his Conservative colleague should be in Parliament not the jungle .

The sight of mounted police units could be banished to the history books after a number of forces revealed they had scrapped the use of police horses to save money. The units, commonly used to police large events such as football matches, are under threat as police forces across the country try to make savings in light of budgetary cutbacks. The decision has been criticised as 'myopic' by policing bodies who said that the closure of police units is 'too important to lose completely'. Under threat: A mounted police officer raises his baton among protesters at Kingsnorth power station in 2008. But mounted patrols face closure as forces across the country look for ways to save money . Public order: Police horses control a crowd during riots at Gardiner's Corner, East London, in 1936. The protesters had gathered to demonstrate against a fascist march . held by The British Union of Fascists . Police horses were widely used across the country to police last summer's riots, leading some officers to question the decision to close the units to make savings. Nottinghamshire and Essex Police forces decided to get rid of their stables earlier this year, while three other forces are reported to be relocating their stables into one amalgamated operation at a separate location. It is thought that South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and Humberside police forces have decided to amalgamate their operations, which could lead to a decrease in the size of the individual units. The cutbacks have prompted the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) to consider commissioning a study aimed at protecting the UK's remaining 14 mounted patrols. The study, which would be carried out by . two academics from Oxford University,  would look at the cost of the . units and hope to show how they deal with public order offences. Acpo's Rod Hansen said that a study would emphasise the value of mounted patrols to UK policing. Feeling the heat: A mounted police patrol races through the streets in Tottenham during the riots in August last year . Line of defence: Officers on horseback form a cordon across Whitehall during a tuition fees protest. But police organisations fear that mounted patrols could be scrapped as forces make cutbacks . The Police Federation's Rick Nelson said that closing forces had already lost 'invaluable experience forever' and said police horses were 'essential' for effective policing. Speaking to The Independent, Mr Nelson said: 'To reduce or disband mounted branches is extremely myopic. 'Once numbers fall below a certain level, we will have lost invaluable experience forever and it will be hard to regain the experience which we as a federation believe is essential for even basic quality policing of big public order events or high pro-file policing. 'On occasions savings of this type may end up costing the service more in the long run. 'Police horses at football and other public order situations or high profile community can reduce the total number of officers required at the event considerably.' Nottinghamshire's unit was disbanded earlier this year, reportedly saving the force £105,000 a year. 'Four of the serving horses have been retired to private homes or went to sanctuaries,' said a spokesman. 'The remaining three continue in active service with Greater Manchester, South Wales and City of London.' Essex Police announced it was to disband the unit in October, blaming 'increasing financial pressures'. The force said the cutbacks would save approximately £600,000 but said that it made the decision with 'great reluctance'. Assistant Chief Constable Sue Harrison . said: 'We know that the public, police officers and staff hold the . Mounted Section in great affection and the unit has provided great . service over the years. Mounted police push protesters away from a demo at the Bank of England in April 2009 . 'However the financial pressures we face need to be met head on and inevitably difficult decisions have to be made. 'The . disbanding of the Mounted Section will lead to approximately £600,000 . of savings annually and the decision to remove these posts is part of . the on-going planned reduction of police officer numbers over the four . year Reform change programme. 'Officers based within the unit will take up new roles elsewhere in the force and staff members will be eligible for redeployment. 'A detailed plan for the disbanding of the unit is now being progressed. If we were not to have taken this decision, then Essex Police would have had to lose an even greater number of officer posts from across the force. 'Securing a good home for the horses will continue to be paramount and we will explore all avenues to achieve this including transferring them to other forces.' Police horses were first used in London in 1760, when Sir John Fielding, the Bow Street magistrate, developed a plan to introduce mounted units in order to deal with highwaymen. The initial introduction of eight horses proved so successful that a patrol of more than 50 horses was put in place in 1805. Wearing red waistcoats, blue coats and trousers, the Bow Street Horse Patrol gave protection on all major roads within 20 miles of Charing Cross. Police horses were first used in London in 1760, when Sir John Fielding, the Bow Street magistrate, developed a plan to introduce mounted units in order to deal with highwaymen . Mounted police take charge at Burnden Park while casualties are removed from an overcrowded match between Bolton Wanderers and Stoke City. Barriers collapsed during the FA Cup second leg 6th round tie, leading to 33 fatalities . While police horses are now associated with patrolling large public events, they were once used to protect people from thieves while transporting livestock. Guards atop the horses often carried a sword and revolver. Mounted police officers have been used by police in West Yorkshire since the early 1890s. The modern-day Metropolitan Police Mounted Branch was established in 1919 when Lt Col Laurie, the ex-Commanding officer of the Royal Scots Grey Regiment, became Assistant Commissioner of the Met. A white police horse named Billy helped clear fans off the pitch at the FA Cup final at Wembley in 1923 after a pitch invasion. The game has since been referred to as the White Horse Final. Its rider, PC George Scorey received one of  Billy's hooves, which was polished and mounted, when the horse died in 1930. Horses usually retire between 18 and 20 years of age, where they can usually expect to retire to a long-term home. David Cameron was left embarrassed earlier this year when he admitted riding a police horse lent to former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks. There are currently 286 horses used by police across 14 mounted units in England, Scotland and Wales.","Nottinghamshire and Essex forces have already got rid of 15 horses .

Giving evidence: Mr Thompson will be questioned about what he knew of the allegations surrounding the disgraced TV presenter . Former BBC director-general Mark Thompson and current CEO of the New York Times company has flown in to London give evidence to an inquiry about an aborted investigation on Jimmy Savile's campaign of sexual abuse. Mr Thompson, who has just begun his new role, will give evidence about the shelved Newsnight inquiry to the Nick Pollard inquiry at hearings in the offices of Reed Smith in central London. Mr Thompson is expected to be quizzed about exactly what he knew about the allegations surrounding the disgraced television presenter. He is also expected to answer questions about a letter that was sent on September 6 to the Sunday Times, denying any part in suppressing the Newsnight film, the Guardian reported. Thompson has said that he did not intervene in Newsnight's Savile investigation, which he was first made aware of at a party a year ago. He asked about the status of the Newsnight film and said he was told by Helen Boaden, the BBC director of news, that because it had been dropped there was nothing to worry about, the Guardian reported. But after lawyers acting for him sent a letter to the Sunday Times in early September, threatening to sue the paper for libel if he was accused of editorial interference, critics say this implies that Thompson knew more about the Savile abuse allegations that he initially let on, the Guardian reported. Thompson says he verbally agreed to the . letter going out, but claims he does not recall reading it or cannot . remember if he was even shown it. But advisers to Thompson say the idea behind sending out the letter came from the BBC's press and legal departments, and that its purpose was only to deny that the director general had exerted any pressure on Newsnight to drop the Savile film, the Guardian reported. The scandal of Savile: The Pollard inquiry is looking into the handling of the Newsnight investigation . They say the letter was . suggested by BBC press and legal departments, and its aim was to deny . that the director general had pressurised Newsnight to drop the Savile inquiry and does not imply that he knew more than he had said. Pollard, the former head of Sky News, said the inquiry has received 40 written submissions and conducted 12 interviews so far, but has more to conduct. He later said he . had a 'chance meeting' with a journalist who mentioned the Newsnight . investigation into Savile, but said he had not been told any of the . details or the scale of the problem.

Jailed: Samuel Myatt killed his best friend in a horrific high-spped crash after tailgating a motorist for two miles . A reckless driver who killed his best friend in a horrific high-speed crash has been jailed for more than three years. Samuel Myatt, who was 19 at the time, was tailgating another motorist for two miles before overtaking on a blind bend and ploughing his Ford Fiesta into a tree. His best friend, Scott Fairlie, 19, was in the front passenger seat and was killed instantly in the crash on November 3 last year. The friends had been chasing another motorist, Liam Slaney, for two miles before overtaking on a notorious S-bend on the A522 near Cheadle, Staffs. Myatt, now 20, admitted causing death by dangerous driving and was jailed for 40 months at Stafford Crown Court. Sentencing him, Judge Mark Eades told him: 'Scott was your friend, he had his whole life in front of him and as a result of your actions he has lost his life and his family and friends have got to live with that loss. The scars will last forever. 'You were driving on a road you knew well, you knew where the double white lines were, but you continued to tailgate. You persisted over a two-mile distance. 'You were egging the other driver on, a deliberate act to provoke a reaction. He didn't respond, so you chose to overtake. The position was highly dangerous, on an S-bend. 'This was a wholly avoidable accident caused by your impetuous driving.' The court heard Myatt repeatedly revved his engine and pursued Mr Slaney for two miles before the fatal crash. After the crash, Mr Slaney told police: 'He floored the accelerator. I have never seen anyone try this before and was shocked and surprised and astounded to see it.' Oncoming driver Ashley Shaw managed to avoid a head-on collision as Myatt crashed off the road and smashed into a tree. Joanne Wallbanks, defending, told the court: 'This was out of character. It resulted in the death of his friend. 'His biggest punishment is having it on his conscience for the rest of his life.' Victim: Myatt's best friend Scott Fairlie, who was in the front passenger seat, was killed instantly in the crash on November 3 last year . Myatt was also banned from driving for five years. The family of Mr Fairlie, from Weston Coyney, Staffs., paid tribute to their 'treasured son' after the case. Devastated mum Gillian said: ''To say we are devastated and heartbroken is an understatement. 'We will never be a happy family again. We have lost a treasured son and Lee has lost his only brother.' Sergeant Ian Tanner, of Staffordshire Police, said: 'We hope the sentence brings some closure for Scott's family and friends, who have endured an extremely difficult 12 months. 'Myatt was responsible for the death of a young man whose life has been cut tragically short.'It is vital that all motorists follow the rules of the road.'","Reckless Samuel Myatt lost control on an S-bend and slammed into a tree .

Cavernous depths: View of a saltwater pond at Nemocon's salt mine in Cundinamarca, Colombia . It was built by miners who carved a place for their daily prayers before they started work. The mine was originally used by the ancient Muisca indigenous people benefited . from the enormous salt deposit and consequently became one of the most . prosperous pre-Hispanic societies of their time. Years later, the salt was used to . finance the campaigns of the liberators Nariño and Bolívar who brought . independence to Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela 200 years ago. The Spanish declared the site the ‘City of Whites’ by vice regal decree. The salt deposit was formed 250million years ago when an inland sea covered the region. The sea eventually dried out and left an enormous deposit of salt buried . below the earth and mud. It solidified and became rocks of salt.

The Texan day care worker who left young children in her house while she went on a shopping trip to Target was today sentenced to 80 years in jail after four of the children died and three others were injured when a fire started in her home. On Tuesday, Houston jurors sentenced 24-year-old Jessica Tata to 80 years in prison for the death of one of the children, 16-month-old Elias Castillo. She still faces charges related to the rest of the children. 'Nobody wins in this situation,' the young victim’s' great-grandmother Patty Sparks said after the sentence was announced. Convicted: Houston jurors sentenced 24-year-old Jessica Tata to 80 years in prison for the death of one of the four children that was killed in a fire at her home when she left them to go shopping . 'My heart goes out to the Tata family and those precious mothers and fathers who lost their babies.' Tata, who was only a few years removed from her teens when she started her day care, worked alone most of the time. Investigators said the February 2011 blaze happened when a pan of oil she had left cooking on the stove ignited while she was out shopping. The same jury that decided her sentence convicted Tata last week of one count of felony murder. The jury could have sentenced her to anywhere from five years to life in prison. Prosecutors had sought a life sentence, while defense attorneys asked only that jurors not give her an excessive sentence. Damage done: Makayla Dickerson, whose brother died in the blaze, shows off one of the burns she received on the fatal day . She will have to serve 30 years of her sentence before she is eligible for parole. Tata also was ordered to pay a $10,000 fine. Jurors deliberated her punishment for seven hours over two days and she had no visible reaction after the sentence was announced. Tata's attorneys contended she was a good person who loved children but made a terrible mistake. Prosecutors argued she was an irresponsible day care owner who had doomed the children when she left them alone. They . said Tata had repeatedly left kids she was responsible for unsupervised . and it was only a matter of time before her actions led to tragedy. Defense . attorney Mike DeGeurin said he still believes Tata should not have been . tried for murder because the deaths were an accident. 'The . sentence is not going to fix things. It's not going to make anybody . feel better later on. But the jury has spoken. That's their sentence,' DeGeurin said. Tata's family . and friends, who declined to comment after the sentence was announced, . had testified she had changed since her troubled teenage years, when she . had pleaded guilty to arson for starting two fires at her high school . on the same day. Defense attorneys had presented expert testimony to argue that a faulty stove or refrigerator may have sparked the blaze. Prosecutor Steve Baldassano said that while he has sympathy for Tata's family, she had nobody to blame but herself. Unwavering: Tata, who has dual citizenship, fled to Nigeria after the fire and was only arrested after she returned to the U.S. 'She was being paid to watch these children. She knew better,' Baldassano said. 'It's not the stove. It's not the refrigerator. It's not any parents' fault. It's nobody's fault but her own.' One of the surviving children, Makayla Dickerson, stood next to Baldassano as he spoke. Makayla, whose 3-year-old brother Shomari died in the fire, showed reporters scars the fire left on her right forearm. Tata's attorneys argued she never intended to hurt the children, who ranged in age from 16 months to 3 years old, and whom Tata had referred to as 'her babies.' But prosecutors did not need to show she intended to harm them, only that the deaths occurred because she put them in danger by leaving them alone. Under Texas law, a person can be convicted of felony murder if he or she committed an underlying felony and that action led to the death. Support: The mothers- Tiffany Dickerson on the left and Rosie Castillo on the right- of two of the victims hug after Tata was sentenced to 80 years in jail for the death of 16-month-old Elias Castillo . In a victim impact statement Sparks read in court after the verdict was announced, she told Tata the children were never 'your babies.' 'They don't belong to you. They never did,' she said. But Sparks said that while she holds Tata accountable for what happened, she forgives her. After reading the statement, Sparks went over to Tata's mother in the courtroom and hugged her. Tata fled to Nigeria after the fire but was captured after about a month, returned to the U.S. in March 2011 and has remained jailed since. She was born in the U.S. but has Nigerian citizenship. Tata still faces three more counts of felony murder in relation to the other children who died, and three counts of abandoning a child and two counts of reckless injury to a child in relation to the three who were hurt. Of those charges, she may only go to trial for the more serious ones as prosecutors said they planned to pursue trials on the remaining felony murder charges but did not comment on the others.","Jessica Tata, 24, ran a day care center out of her home in Houston, Texas .

An 'evil' Lithuanian couple who viciously attacked a frail 88-year-old at his Lancashire home and ransacked his home have been jailed. Laurynas Dauksas, 25, was sentenced to 11 years in prison and Aurelisa Galdikaite, 23, to nine years for their 'despicable' attack on Arnold Hilton. Liverpool Crown Court heard that the pair entered Mr Hilton's home in Upholland, Lancashire on the night of March 20. 'Evil': Mother-of-one Aurelisa Galdikaite, 23, was sentenced to 9 years and her partner Laurynas Dauksas, 25, was sentenced to 11 for the robbery of 88-year-old Arnold Hilton . Dauksas, who was on licence after . being released from prison for a motoring offence, beat Mr Hilton as . Galdikaite, a mother-of-one, ransacked 'every drawer in every room' in . his house. The former Bevin Boy and glazing . firm manager was found by his son, Stuart, collapsed and bleeding on . his bedroom floor at 6.30am the next day and told him: 'I'm not going to . make it.' 'Mercifully', . Judge David Aubrey QC said, Mr Hilton did survive. But after spending . two weeks in hospital he is now living in a care home and has not been . able to return to his own home. Dauksas and Galdikaite both pleaded guilty to one count of robbery at an earlier hearing. In mitigation, Frances Hertzog, for Dauksas, said he had 'expressed remorse for the attack'. Jonathan . Lally, mitigating for Galdikaite, said her young child had been taken . to Lithuania after her arrest and she was unlikely to see the child for . many years to come. The defendants of Worsley Mesnes, Wigan, received sentences longer than 12 months which means they will face automatic deportation on their release. Speaking . outside court, Stuart Hilton said his father, who has five children, 10 . grandchildren and one great-grandchild, had changed drastically since . the attack. Mr . Hilton, 43, a quality control inspector from Preston, said: 'Up until . this happened, even though he was 88, he was still sociable. 'He used to travel two miles on the bus from his house to his pub to see his pals and then get it back. 'Sometimes, he would walk it in summer, so he was fit and active. 'He loved his sport, he played golf for years and enjoyed watching football and rugby. 'He's gone from going out three or four times a week to living in a care home and having 24-hour care.' Victim: Arnold Hilton, 88, pictured here in hospital with appalling . injuries told his son 'I'm not going to make it' following the shocking . attack in March this year . Mr Hilton said it was very hard to witness how his father changed after the attack.Asked about the defendants, he said: 'As individuals they are the lowest of the low, but justice has been done.' Detective Inspector Marc Nasser, of Lancashire Police, said: 'Stuart Hilton called in to see his father as a matter of routine en-route to work and finding his father in that state must have been devastating. 'This was a disgraceful attack on an innocent, defenceless and vulnerable man who has been left traumatised and confused by the attack. 'The level of violence used was beyond comprehension and I am disgusted and appalled that anyone could do this. 'Sadly as a result of this incident Arnold now lives in a care home and will never been able to return home. He has lost much of his independence and confidence. 'This really was an appalling crime and I am pleased that Dauksas and Galdikaite are both behind bars.' As both defendants received sentences longer than 12 months, they will face automatic deportation on their release.","Arnold Hilton was discovered by his son collapsed and bleeding the next day .

These staggering pictures of a beautiful rare white deer might seem like something straight out of a CS Lewis adventure. But they were in fact taken by a Scottish family in Taynuilt, Argyll as they literally came face to face with the stuff of legends. The shots of the white stag were captured by Michelle and Anthony Veitch who were stunned to come across the mythical creature - said by many to be a lucky charm - as they . took their four-year-old daughter Olivia to her dance school. Beautiful: Michelle Veitch and her family spotted this rare white deer near Taynuilt, Argyll and Bute . Rare: Far from being afraid of the Veitch fmily, the white stag led them long the pathway towards four-year-old Olivia's dance school . The family were driving through the Highland forest when they spotted the unusual stag and slammed on the brakes. But the ghost-like deer was not fussed with the stunned family and stared them down before running off back into the forest. Michelle, 30, said she had never seen or heard about white deer before and took a snap of the animal. The family now hope that spotting the creature will bring them a slice of luck before Christmas. She said: 'Usually deer disappear into the trees, but this one didn’t, and just kept walking up the road in front of us. 'It led us a considerable distance right up the road until we got to a cattle grid then it jumped into the woods. 'We went over the grid and parked in the Ballet West car park and there it was again right in front of us, staring straight at us. Graceful: The beautiful creature eventually disappeared silently into the bushes . 'I took its picture then it just silently disappeared into the woods again.' After the discovery on Saturday, Michelle went home, ironically to Stag Park in Lochgilphead, and looked up white deer on the internet. Michelle found that many people believe a white stag is a lucky omen and they also hold a place in the mythology of many cultures. Legend has it on the island of Arran that if a white stag in seen then a member of the ruling family, the Hamilton Clan, has died. Michelle added: 'It’s a bit weird when you think about it, us in Stag Park, then this unusual stag. 'The whole thing sounds like a good omen to me. I hope so. Christmas is coming up, and a lottery win would be nice.' Olivia who was being taken to her class couldn’t believe her eyes and ran to her shocked teacher claiming: 'A white deer led us up the road.' A spokeswoman for Scottish Natural Heritage said it was unlikely the deer was an albino and was more likely to have a rare condition called leucism. She said: 'White deer are rare. They can either be albinos or they can have a rare genetic pattern called leucism which causes a reduction in the pigment of their hair and skin.' White deer are often confused with albino deer but the albino is distinctive because of its characteristic red eyes. Unlike an albino, leucism causes a reduction in pigmentation and not just melanin. There are several well known references to the white deer in mythology, legend and literature: . According to the Scots legend, in 1128, David I, King of Scotland decided to go hunting on the Feast Day of the Holy Rood, against the wishes of his priest. While hunting he saw a huge white stag, or ""hart"", and while giving chase he was thrown from his horse. The white hart charged forward to kill him, so David - son of Malcolm Canmore and St Margaret - called on God to save him. As the king grasped the hart's antlers, they miraculously turned in to a large cross, and the beast raised its head and vanished. Inspired by his vision, King David built a shrine to the Holy Rood - meaning Holy Cross - on the spot where the miracle occurred. The ruin of Holyrood Abbey can still be seen today, at the foot of the Royal Mile next to Holyrood Palace. The White Hart Inn in Edinburgh's grassmarket, reputedly the oldest pub in the capital, took its name from the legend. The Celts considered white stags to be messengers from the ""other world"" and their appearance was said to herald some profound change in the lives of those who encountered them. In the Chronicles of Narnia, the White Stag is fabled to grant wishes to whoever catches him. And in the Arthurian legend, the white stag is the creature that can never be caught. King Arthur's repeatedly unsuccessful pursuit of the white stag represents mankind's quest for spiritual knowledge. In Christianity a white stag was said to be instrumental in the conversion of the martyr Saint Eustace after he saw a vision of the animal that told him he would suffer for Christ.","Michelle and Anthony Veitch came across the creature in Taynuilt, Argyll, while taking daughter Olivia to a dance class .

The volunteer clown who tragically died of a heart attack during Macy's Thanksgiving parade and his wife of nearly 42 years were 'like peas in a pod,' according to friends of the Yonkers couple. Irene Blasetti and husband, Robert, 67, had been inseparable since they met when she was just 15 and he was 20, and the annual parade was an event the childless couple always looked forward to. But this year's spectacle turned to horror when Mr Blasetti suffered a fatal cardiac arrest and crumpled to the ground in front of his wife's eyes at 39th Street and Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, ending their blissful union of almost half a century. Inseparable: Robert and Irene Blasetti, pictured were inseparable until he died during the Macy's parade . Fighting back the tears, Mrs Blasetti, 62, rushed to her husband's side as he lay on his back in full clown costume flanked by horrified witnesses, including many children. Dressed in a matching outfit, she desperately tried to administer CPR before paramedics arrived on the scene and transferred the elderly man to hospital where he was pronounced dead. The couple grew up in Yonkers where, for the past 30 years, Mr Blasetti worked for therapist Akhter Ahsen and his psychiatrist wife Anne Dolan, who had become friends. Mrs Blasetti helped her husband in his role of office manager and research assistant. Grieving, she did not want to talk about her husband's death. But Dr Dolan told The New York Times: 'They were like peas in a pod. They did everything together.' The couple had dropped in to their home on Wednesday evening, Dr Dolan said. Her son, Ossie Ahsen, 43, told the newspaper . that they had been talking fondly about volunteering in the . Thanksgiving event, which they had been a part of for at least the past . six years. Tragedy: Robert Blasetti, 67, was blowing up balloons as a clown on the Macy's Parade route when he abruptly collapsed beside his wife, seen staying by his side in similar costume . 'They were telling us about being in the parade, which they loved,' he said. 'It brought them a lot of pleasure.' Mr Ahsen described his employee as 'the quintessential, jolly, robust New Yorker.' The Blasettis were among 900 clowns . recruited to entertain the thronging crowds lining the parade route and . had been twisting balloons into animals for excitable children when the . tragedy occurred. Pulled from her husband in tears, Mrs Blasetti watched as he was transferred by stretcher into an ambulance and rushed to Roosevelt Hospital. 'All of a sudden he collapsed and fell on his back. People came to him right away. It didn't look like he was breathing. People started pumping his chest,' witness Tuvia Yamnik told the New York Post  of the scene. Macy's spokesman Orlando Veras said . they were 'saddened to report' that a parade marcher had suffered a . medical emergency but would not confirm whether Mr Blasetti was a Macy's . employee. Heart break: His wife was hurried off in tears after entertaining the parade's many children and doing her best to administer CPR to him .

A man convicted of murder in Bangladesh is teaching at a secondary school in east London after checks into his criminal history failed, it has been revealed today. Mohammad Siddiqur Rahman Chowdhury, an Islamic Studies teacher in Bethnal Green, is being investigated by the Home Office after it was revealed he was found guilty of murder in absentia in his native Bangladesh. The teacher had undergone a Criminal Record Bureau check (CRB) but the conviction was not unearthed as the crime had happened overseas. Chowdhury has denied the murder, claiming he was framed, and that it was actually committed by his brother who is now dead. The case has highlighted a problem with CRB checks which can lead to crimes committed overseas going undetected. Chowdhury, 38, has been employed as a teacher at the Darul Hadis Latifiah School in east London since 2001. But he was wanted for the 1997 murder of Hazi Akbor Ali, The Sunday Times reports, in what was allegedly a family dispute. Although six people were charged, including his brother Seraj and father, they were acquitted and only Chowdhury was convicted in the 2005 trial. The father of two - who was made a UK citizen after marrying a British woman in 2001 - was sentenced to life in prison in absentia. He has since claimed his brother killed Ali in self defence.

Growing up in Nacogdoches in Texas, the model left for New York soon after her rape ordeal. Her one-time husband, Stewart recalled their early years and how they married after she became pregnant with their first child, Kimberly. 'There was no big romantic proposal, no going down on bended knee — just a joint decision that this was the right thing to do,' said the rock-star. Describing their life together as one long surreal party, the ex-Faces frontman spoke the rarified world of celebrity Alana introduced him to. 'This was our Great Gatsby period. On the guest list would be people such as Barbra Streisand, Warren Beatty, Dustin Hoffman, Jack Nicholson, Anjelica Huston, Albert Finney, Linda Evans, Joan and Jackie Collins, Ryan O’Neal and Farrah Fawcett, to whom Alana was very close . . . it just went on and on,' said Rod.

'The main bones of contention were: my friends, my love of football and the amount of time I spent working. 'I was less sympathetic than I might have been.

'Then maybe the team would have a bit of a drink afterwards, and by the time I got back it would be mid-afternoon, the lunch would be dried up in the oven and Alana would be steaming with fury.

The search for an aristocratic Frenchman who is believed to have murdered his wife and four children in cold blood has returned to the isolated countryside where he was last seen. Police are preparing to visit underground caves and abandoned potassium mines in the area around Roquebrune-sur-Argens, where Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes was spotted by a CCTV camera in April 2011. He fled his home in Nantes, western France, a few days earlier after neighbours reported not having seen any of the family for more than three weeks. Suspect: Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes, 51, may be hiding in caves near where the family lived. Right, wife Agnes, 49, was found dead at their home along with her four children and two pet dogs . Detectives who visited initially found a severed leg under the garden terrace, and then uncovered the bodies of Mr De Ligonnes's wife and four children, as well as the family's two pet Labradors. Agnes, 49, and children Tomas, 21, Arthur, 18, Anne, 16, and Benoit, 13, had all been blasted to death as they slept before their bodies were meticulously buried in a clear attempt to conceal them from police. De Ligonnes originally came from Versailles, home of the pre-Revolutionary kings and queens of France, and was technically a count who could trace his lineage back generations. In emails uncovered earlier this year he revealed that he considered himself to be part of a Roman Catholic elite which was superior to 'the masses'. 'I think I've got a superiority complex, you could call it that,' he wrote. 'But it's based on a simple observation: I belong to a group of people who are intelligent, determined, balanced and in good moral and physical health. Such people are rare compared to the masses.' Grim: An agent carries a body out of the family's home in 2011 . Investigation: Police found a severed leg under the garden terrace, which led to the discovery of the bodies . Recalling his strict, devout childhood, De Ligonnes added: 'All my adolescence was devoted to religion and faith, under the influence of my grandmother and mother. 'To such an extent that I did not rebel like other adolescents, nor indulge in drugs or run after girls.' De Ligonnes was last seen on April 15 2011 when he left a budget hotel at Roquebrune-sur-Argens in the Var region on France's Mediterranean coast, abandoning his car there. He was wearing a backpack as he strolled through a car park into the surrounding countryside, and was picked up by a CCTV camera. An extensive search was carried out in the area between April and June 2011 and - acting on new information - police now intend to resume it. 'We won't be going back to the area already searched, but will be probing places which are difficult to access, including isolated hiking trails,' said a judicial source. Caves and mines around near Roquebrune will be examined, as well as near Draguignan and Lorgues - both town where the De Ligonnes family lived in the late 1980s and 90s. Tragic: Anne Dupont, 16, and eldest  Arthur, 18, were killed by gunfire . Shot: Tomas, 21, and youngest child Benoit, 13, had also been killed and their bodies put in a freshly-dug grave . There is a theory that De Ligonnes may have committed suicide in the days after the slaughter, in which case police will be searching for remains of his body. However, prosecutors have not ruled out the possibility that De Ligonnes is still living rough, or else is being hidden by members of his extended family, who own country homes around France. De Ligonnes's ancestors, who included the 19th Century poet Lamartine, originally lived in a southern province of France called the Rouergue. Five months before the murders, De Ligonnes said he had inherited a .22 rifle from his father and started target practice at a Nantes shooting club. Receipts found in his house also reveal that he bought a silencer, as well as a spade, a two-wheel trolley, chalk lime, and other equipment which could have been used to bury the bodies. It also emerged that De Ligonnes, who ran a number of internet businesses, had severe financial difficulties. Among those he had been asking for money was a mistress in Paris.","Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes could be hiding underground .

One senior colleague said Dominic Grieve was on a mission to be the 'most unpopular man in the world' Cabinet ministers are plotting to oust Attorney General Dominic Grieve after a series of political blunders. Senior government figures are furious at ‘ridiculous Europhile Grieve’ for his refusal to back colleagues in the battle to stop the European Court of Human Rights demanding Britain give prisoners the vote. Downing Street was also dismayed this week when Mr Grieve took just 40 minutes to dismiss a call from Defence Secretary Philip Hammond for a review of the case of SAS solider Sgt Danny Nightingale, who was jailed for 18 months for keeping a souvenir Iraq pistol. Mr Hammond let slip his fury, when he went on live TV and took a swipe at ‘tremendously pompous lawyers’. Now it has emerged that ministers are so fed up they want Mr Grieve removed from his job. One senior Cabinet minister said: ‘It’s high time we got rid of him - he never seems to be on our side.’ Another senior colleague said he was determined to make himself the 'most unpopular man in the world'. Mr Grieve survived the last reshuffle, but his deputy Edward Garnier was sacked and replaced by Oliver Heald. Some Tories believe Tory MP Mr Grieve could decide to quit on his own terms, after clashes with Cabinet colleagues. Cabinet colleagues were dumbfounded this week when he moved quickly to pour cold water on efforts by Mr Hammond to help Sgt Nightingale's appeal against his jail sentence. Mr Hammond wrote to Mr Grieve asking him to look at the case and see if Sgt Nightingale's prosecution had been in the public interest. But barely 40 minutes after news of Mr Hammond's letter emerged, the Attorney General's office said it would be 'inappropriate' to intervene. The rebuttal was especially embarrassing as Sgt Nightingale's wife Sally was due at Number 10 that afternoon to meet aides to David Cameron, after she wrote to the Prime Minister about the case. SAS soldier Sgt Danny Nightingale has been jailed for possessing a 'war trophy' pistol presented to him by the Iraqi Army for outstanding service . Ministers are also furious that the . Attorney General this week banned them from expressing a view on whether . prisoners should be able to take part in elections. Mr Grieve said minister must abstain when the crucial vote takes place in the House of Commons next year. The law officer has also ruled that the Government must not ‘take a position’ in the debate by expressing support for a ban. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling told the Commons Britain could ignore fines from the European Court of Human Rights . Yesterday Justice Secretary Chris . Grayling made clear in the Commons his opposition to the EHCR ruling . that prisoners should have the vote. He . repeatedly stressed that the UK Parliament is ‘sovereign’ and floated . the prospect of Britain refusing to pay any fines which could be imposed . if the ruling is ignored. 'Ultimately if this Parliament decides not to agree to rulings from the ECHR it has no sanction,' Mr Grayling said. 'It can apply fines in absentia but it will be for Parliament to decide whether it wishes to recognise those decisions, as it is with all decisions.' Mr Grayling replaced Ken Clarke as Justice Secretary, who was seen as too pro-European on criminal justice matters. But colleagues now think Mr Grieve is a road block to taking a tougher line on law and order. ‘He seems to be trying to make himself the most unpopular man in the world, filling a niche previously occupied by Kenneth Clarke,’ said one. However, allies insist he is just fulfilling his role as the government's chief lawyer. 'He has a lot of support and respect on the Conservative benches,' said a friend.","Tory minister accused of trying to be 'the most unpopular man in the world'

Little boy Jack Baird is one of 20 children whose hopes of finding a cure to a rare disease have been dashed after a hoax ‘donor’ pledged £1million to charity before disappearing. The hoaxer led the Society for Mucopolysaccharide Diseases (MPS) to believe that he would make the donation enabling the charity to conduct a drugs trial. Two-year-old Jack was being considered for the scheme and it was only when MPS stopped receiving correspondence from the ‘donor’ that the Buckinghamshire-based charity realised they had been duped. Distraught: Gemma Nelson had hoped her son Jack would be selected for the drugs trial . There are 150 in the UK who suffer from the deadly Sanfilippo condition, which causes severe mental and physical deterioration. Jack’s mother Gemma Nelson, 29, has branded the stunt as 'sick' but remains determined to continue fundraising for her son. The mother, who also has an older son Lewis, 9, said: ‘We were so happy. ‘They said he wanted to remain anonymous so I just assumed it was a celebrity.’ Families of children with the rare condition had raised £100,000 towards funding the £600,000 treatment which would prolong their lives. They believed they had struck gold when, following television coverage, one of the mothers received an email and a Facebook friend request from an anonymous potential donor, claiming to be a ‘self-made man’. He offered to put up the remaining £500,000 needed to fund the trial, saying: ‘I’ve got my own kids and it’s what I would want for them.’ Duped charity: The Society for Mucopolysaccharide Diseases (pictured) only realised they had been tricked by the 'self-made man' when they stopped receiving correspondence from him . The other 18 families were also told about the offer. In a series of communications, the 'donor' increased his offer to £1million, claiming he was 'so moved by the cause' that he wanted to support more children suffering with these devastating diseases. He told MPS that lawyers had been appointed and his bank had been instructed to arrange the donation. Then, after claiming a mix-up had led to a delay in payment, correspondence suddenly stopped. Another mother Gemma, from Ryhope, Tyne and Wear, said: ‘I would never have thought someone would be cruel enough to do something like this. ‘This makes us more determined to raise the full amount.’ There is no treatment available for the disease and those afflicted by the condition are not expected to live beyond their teens. Determined to raise the money: Ms Nelson, along with other parents, have pledged to raise the money needed for the drugs trial despite the cruel hoax . A Genistein drug treatment is offering some hope for families as it has been shown to halt the progression of the disease in preclinical studies but needs to be clinically trialled before it can be prescribed in the UK. A spokeswoman for Wicked Genes, the fundraising branch of MPS, said: ‘Funding for clinical studies in children with ultra-rare diseases appears to be of little interest to major research funding bodies, and so Wicked Genes have taken it in to their own hands to raise the £600,000 needed. ‘The hoaxer maintained his cruel charade for over two weeks, regularly making contact with the charity and promising the money so the clinical trial could start immediately to save these children’s lives. ‘Whilst the MPS Society was cautious, it also found it difficult to believe a hoaxer could act so immorally and chose such a vulnerable group of children and their families as his victims. ‘Hopes raised of the clinical trial starting before Christmas have been heartbreakingly dashed.’ The hoax was reported to Thames Valley Police but they said no crime had been committed and they could not take further action.

He suggested that former director-general George Entwistle, who resigned 54 days into the job over  the Jimmy Savile and Newsnight scandals, had been ‘manoeuvred’ into the position but was given no support from management when he needed it. 'No experience': Former BBC director-general Greg Dyke (right) has attacked Lord Patten (left), chairman of the BBC Trust, in a newspaper column, writing that he has no relevant experience and only wants to become an 'all-powerful BBC chairman' Writing in the Daily Telegraph today, Mr Dyke said that in the short-term, the BBC has been ‘clearly damaged’ but that under new director-general Tony Hall, the corporation will recover. Mr Dyke wrote: ‘Lord Patten… has no real experience of running any sort of organisation was appointed chairman of the trust. ‘Within a matter of months, it was clear, to me at least, that he was working out how he could be an all-powerful BBC chairman. ‘He manoeuvred into (Mark) Thompson’s place George Entwistle, someone with limited managerial experience and no experience of dealing with a crisis.’ The starting point of BBC’s total . collapse of morale at Newsnight, the BBC's flagship current affairs . programme, came after its investigation exposing Jimmy Savile as a . paedophile was canned late last year in favour of a Christmas tribute to . the BBC star. Given no support: Former director-general George Entwistle (left) resigned 54 days after taking the job, offered by Lord Patten (right) after being overwhelmed by both the Jimmy Savile and Newsnight scandals . What made . matters worse was that ITV broadcast its own exposé on Savile in . September, using much of the material Newsnight had gathered as evidence . against the disgraced DJ. The editor, Peter Rippon, has stepped aside as a result of the scandal. Mr Dyke said that Lord Patten was ‘smitten’ with Mr Entwistle when selecting from candidates. 'Big job': Mr Pyke says that Tony Hall, the newly appointed director-general, has a huge task to rebuild trust in the corporation . He wrote of Lord Patten: ‘So why was . he so smitten with George? The argument goes that he was Patten’s sort . of person – male, white, urbane, intellectual and public school . educated.' Mr Entwistle was appointed and started . work in September before being overwhelmed by both the Jimmy Savile and . Newsnight scandals and quit after 54 days. Mr Dyke wrote: ‘Figures show that this trust has now been broken and the biggest job Tony Hall has is to rebuild it.’ Mr Dyke suggested that the current affairs and news departments, which were merged nearly 20 years ago, should be broken up ‘so that daily shows like Newsnight don’t get involved in long-term, costly investigation’. He also suggested that Lord Hall must change the BBC’s complex management structure. He said: ‘The problem is that there are “acting” leaders in virtually all the top jobs. ‘A wealth of experience was lost after George Entwistle was appointed – people whom the BBC could have used to steady the ship and plan the future.’ Lord Hall of Birkenhead, who first applied to be DG 13 years ago, replaced George Entwistle and was given a brief to regain public trust in the corporation.

"South East topped poll with 20 per cent of men using treatment . Merseyside 'least impotent' capital . Westminster, London named as top town for men seeking impotency treatment . Up to 33% of men will suffer in their life . By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 05:16 EST, 23 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:19 EST, 23 November 2012 . Men in the South East topped the poll of those seeking the most impotency treatment, while Merseyside came bottom . The South East has been named the ‘Impotence Capital of England’, according to a new study. Results showed that almost 20 per cent of those seeking treatment for the problem live in the South East of England, a higher percentage than any other region. The area of the South East witht he highest count of men suffering impotence is Westminster. Experts have warned that there could be a rise in impotence due to men suffering from an increase in stress and anxiety – caused by long working hours, home pressures and the recession. The South East was closely followed by . the South Midlands, which accounted for 11.3 per cent of completed . impotence consultations. In third place was the West Midlands (9.3 per cent), with Yorkshire (7.9 per cent) in fourth place. The . data suggest that the North of England is the most virile region with . the North West (2.4 per cent) and Merseyside (1.8 per cent) coming . bottom of the table. Impotence is a common condition with studies showing that up to 33 per cent of men will suffer it at some point of their life. The causes can be either physical or psychological, and in most circumstances can be easily treated by a health professional. Experts believe that long hours, stress and the recession are to blame for more men seeking treatment . But with men taking on more roles in their day-to-day lives, many are finding that the extra pressures are having a direct impact on their sex lives. Impotence is now more commonly known as erectile dysfunction (ED), or sometimes erection difficulties. Men find they're unable to achieve or sustain an erection adequate for sexual intercourse. Dr Hilary Jones, a medical adviser to the UK’s first online clinic, HealthExpress, who carried out the research, said: 'The survey could reflect a regional reticence factor in men actually admitting erectile dysfunction and seeking help for it, however, impotence is a common issue and many GPs have seen an increased number of men coming to them for advice, as the stress of everyday life affects their erectile function. 'However, it is key to gain medical advice as in some cases it can be a sign of a more serious underlying health issues including diabetes and heart problems. 'Impotence is not something men should be embarrassed about and there a lot of treatments on the market, whether that be prescription drugs, therapy in the form of counselling or relaxation, and in rare cases, surgery.'

You don't have to shop at Harrods any more to dine like a millionaire. Lidl is selling 100g pots of caviar for just £1.49 – making the delicacy cheaper than a Big Mac. The budget chain's product is capelin caviar, which is highly prized in Japan, although gourmets do not put it in the same class as the finest Golden Almas caviar. Sales for the supermarket's Deluxe range have risen by 200 per cent in the last two years . But then it doesn't come with the same price tag of £840 for a measly 30g. Even the cheapest caviar at Fortnum and Mason comes in at £80 for 30g, with prices ranging all the way up to £350 for 200g. Meanwhile at the likes of Lidl and Aldi, quail, goose and Grand Cru champagne are joining caviar on the shelves as affordable treats for 'Middle Britain' families putting aside their prejudices and looking to stretch their food budgets. Traditionally, caviar refers to the salted eggs of sturgeon. But now it is an endangered species, the eggs of other fish such as salmon, paddlefish, whitefish and lumpfish can be used if the name is on the packaging. Lidl's version uses capelin – a small forage fish found in the Atlantic and Arctic oceans. A Lidl spokesman said they achieve their low price because they produce it on such a large scale. It was introduced in stores in November 2010 and in the past three weeks the chain has seen a 171 per cent increase in sales compared to last year. Many stores have had to re-order it to meet customer demand. Budget banquet offerings from Aldi include a whole fresh British goose, typically weighing 4.5kg, for £34.99, while there are quails at £4.99 for four, and venison steaks at £6.99 for 400g. There is also a Luxury Champagne and Gold Leaf Christmas Pudding at £9.99, while its £7.99 Orange Topped Christmas Pudding won plaudits from the Good Housekeeping Institute. Sales of Aberdeen Angus steak, prize-winning champagne, parmesan cheese, olive oil and freshly ground coffee are driving a sales boom at the chain. The Deluxe range at Lidl includes a 1.5kg three bird roast at £9.99. Four quails are £5.99, a pack of venison loin steaks is £9.99 and a frozen goose is a modest £19.99. It is selling lobster at £5.99 for a 350g pack and 12 large scallops for £3.99. The growth of the German-owned chains is posing a real threat to Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons. BMWs and Audis fill their car parks while their products have won a host of taste and quality prizes. Aldi has seen an 18 per cent increase in shoppers from the wealthiest A and B social classes. They will be snapping up the chain's Grand Cru Champagne for £22.99, which is a saving of 54 per cent on the usual £49.99 market price. There is also a Grand Cru Classé 2004 Margaux for £22.99, which is down from a usual £43.82, and a 30 Year Old Tawny Port for £37.99, which is less than half the usual market price of £79.95. Lidl has seen a 200 per cent increase in sales of its Deluxe range products in the past two years. Spokesman Georgina Hall said: 'The range allows you to enjoy an aspirational lifestyle without forking out when it comes to cost.'

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has announced a multimillion-pound contract to buy 51 new light patrol vehicles for soldiers in Afghanistan. Defence Minister Philip Dunne announced the £46 million deal for the extra Foxhound vehicles during a visit to the British company that makes them. The Foxhound replaced the Army’s Snatch Land Rover, which proved highly vulnerable to roadside bombs used by insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan. Deal: Defence Minister Philip Dunne stands in front of a new Foxhound light patrol vehicle at the General Dynamics distribution centre in Telford where he announced a multimillion-pound contract to buy 51 of the vehicles for soldiers in Afghanistan . Kitted out: The Foxhound Light Protected Patrol Vehicle offers more protection to passengers from roadside bombs . It has enhancements including a V-shaped hull to give protection against the bombs which have been a common tactic of Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. The Army’s most agile protected vehicle, it uses cutting-edge Formula 1 technology to provide unparalleled protection for its weight and class. It can reach speeds of up to 80mph and drive away from an improvised explosive device (IED) strike on just three wheels, while its engine is so advanced it can be changed in 30 minutes and put back on the road. Costly: The MoD has announced that it is spending £46 million on 51 new Foxhound vehicles . Ready to go: Defence Minister Philip Dunne said it has taken 40 months from the design stage ton get the vehicles ready for deployment in Afghanistan . The first Foxhounds were deployed to . Afghanistan earlier this year and are now being used by soldiers who are . mentoring and partnering with the Afghan National Security Forces. Mr Dunne announced details of the new contract during a visit to General Dynamics Land Systems: Force Protection Europe’s spares facility in Telford, which provides spares for the Foxhound vehicle. During the visit, Mr Dunne and Major . Chris Thoms, requirements manager for protected mobility at the MoD, met . with staff who are also providing logistical support to the army in . Afghanistan. Mr Dunne, . Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology, said: 'I was . pleased to meet with employees at General Dynamics: Force Protection who . have helped make Foxhound a real procurement success story, taking only . 40 months to develop it from the initial design to deployment in . Afghanistan. 'The work being done by staff here in Telford is ensuring the vehicles can stay on the road and helping our soldiers do the vital job of engaging with Afghan forces and protecting the local population. 'Balancing the MoD’s budget means we can now confidently invest in equipment like Foxhound, which has the flexibility and adaptability to operate in a wide variety of environments, providing capability for the Army well into the future. 'This investment shows the MoD playing its part in delivering growth and sustaining jobs in the West Midlands industrial base.' The contract is part of an overall investment of £340 million by the MoD in Foxhound since 2010, and the 51 extra vehicles take the Army’s total fleet to 376 vehicles. The contract is also expected to sustain jobs at the company’s Telford facility, its headquarters in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, and throughout the UK in its supply chain. Speaking in September when Foxhound was first operational in Afghanistan, chief of staff for the Bastion Force Protection Wing Squadron Leader Jim Stewart said: 'Foxhound is an enormous leap forward in capability. 'The off-road mobility, enhanced protection and night-vision systems that it offers to the troops on the ground are unmatched in a vehicle of this size.'

Police were forced to give millions of pounds to a private security firm after locking up too many  suspected criminals. Sussex Police was charged extra by Reliance Secure Task Management after detaining more prisoners in their custody centres than was agreed in a £90 million Private Finance Initiative (PFI) deal. The force had to pay out for six consecutive years after the number of detainees rose sharply. Sussex Police have been forced to hand over millions of pounds to Reliance Secure Task Management after detaining more prisoners in their custody centres than agreed . Sussex Police, pictured, had to pay out for six consecutive years after the number of prisoners rose sharply . But since then the number of arrests made by Sussex Police has fallen sharply. Critics claim that the PFI deal could be seen by the public as a reason for officers to let criminals off with cautions instead of arresting them. Robin Murray, vice-chairman of the Criminal Law Solicitors’ Association, said: ‘Even if there is no correlation between the extraordinary fall in detainee numbers over the past few years and this arrangement, the public would have a right to be deeply suspicious that the arrangement is playing a part.’ Sussex became one of the first police forces in Britain to outsource its custody services when it signed the 2001 deal with Reliance. Under the contract, the private firm brought in civilian employees to man custody desks and cells. On top of a basic annual charge, now £9 million a year, Sussex agreed to pay Reliance more if the number of detainees rose above 42,000. Critics claim that the deal with Reliance Secure Task Management could be seen as a reason to let criminals off lightly with cautions . Having started at 41,245 in  2002-03, the number taken in to custody rose to 46,754 the following year. Detainee numbers reached a peak of 51,347 in 2007-08. But this slumped to 41,204 in 2009-10 and is estimated to be 37,129 this year. Internal police authority reports admit that a change in tactics by officers was partly responsible. One study credited the drop in the number of detainees to ‘the Chief Constable’s revised style of policing, emphasising a qualitative approach to arresting’. But a spokesman for the force said: ‘The financial structure of the contract has never played any part in operational decision-making regarding arrest and detention.’ Sussex’s newly elected Police and Crime Commissioner Katy Bourne said: ‘I am reassured that any  conditions of the contract would not have a negative impact on the operational decision-making of arrest and detention.’ Reliance declined to comment.","Sussex Police had to pay Reliance Secure Task Management extra for six consecutive years after prisoners rose sharply .

A 13-year-old boy has been missing from his Colorado home for six days as police struggle with a lack of clues amid his mother's fears that he 'wouldn't have left willingly.' Dylan Redwine, of Colorado Springs, was visiting his father in Vallecito for Thanksgiving break under the terms of a court order when he vanished from the home, the father has told police. His mother says Dylan was unhappy about having to make the trip, but that he would not have run away from home. Scroll down for video . Missing: Dylan Redwine, 13, was last seen Monday during a court-ordered visit to his father's home in Vallecito, Colorado for Thanksgiving . 'Dylan wouldn't have left willingly,' Elaine Redwine said on Friday during an interview at the home of a friend. 'If there was any way to communicate he would have called.' The boy's father Mark Redwine told investigators he last saw his son on Monday morning around 7.30 before leaving the home to run errands. He said his son was gone when he returned. A neighbour who knows Dylan told police he saw the boy walking along a road in Vallecito the afternoon he went missing but thought nothing of it until hearing the police reports. Police say they haven't ruled out foul play. 'We have not ruled out any possibility' Dan Bender, Public Information Officer for La Plata Sheriff's Office told 9News. 'This is the fifth day Dylan has been missing with few clues to work from.' Break from family: Dylan's mother admits that her son didn't want to be with his father over the break while a neighbour reported seeing him walking around hours after missing . The missing boy is 5 feet tall, weighing 105 pounds, with blond hair, blue eyes and fair complexion. He was last seen wearing a blue-and-white Duke Blue Devils baseball cap, black Nike T-shirt and black Jordan tennis shoes. Dylan was picked up Sunday by his father at Durango-La Plata County Airport, his mother said on Friday. Dylan announced his arrival in a text message and ended it with an emoticon expressing a scowl, she said. Mrs Redwine added that the boy's father rarely exercises his right to see his own son. Mr Bender said that the search on Saturday morning would expand to Bayfield, a town south of Vallecito. Other searchers would work near Vallecito Reservoir and on Forest Service roads in the area, he said. Dozens of area volunteers have helped canvass the county looking for the teen, Mr Bender said. Elaine Redwine told the newspaper that she doubts her son would have gone into the woods. 'Dylan is a generational kid and tech savvy,' she said.

Britain's most reckless drivers will be kept off the road while they pose a threat under plans for a new Government crackdown on dangerous motorists, it was revealed today. Courts will be able to order more motorists who commit serious driving offences like speeding over 100mph to take an extended test that lasts twice as long as that faced by learners. The proposals unveiled by the Department . for Transport would extend the range of offences where an order can be made, such as . serious cases of careless driving and speeding significantly over the limit. A proposed crackdown on speeding drivers will see those caught at 100mph ordered to take an extend test to get their licence back . Currently extended tests are required for motorists banned for more than 56 days for dangerous driving, drink driving and other serious offences such as causing death by dangerous driving. In the last financial year 5,299 motorists had to take extended car tests before being having their licences restored. According to the latest figures from the Ministry of Justice more than 9,000 motorists were banned from driving for a single speeding offence by the courts last year. Motoring groups believe around a third of these drivers could be hit by the proposals which are intended to act against the worst offenders. They could be joined by around 1,000 more motorists who are banned by the courts for the worst cases of careless driving. Under current sentencing guidelines issued to the courts, motorists caught driving at 30mph over the post speed limit should be given an immediate ban. Speed camera: The proposals are part of a wider clamp down on dangerous driving, that includes those found over the alcohol limit . This is because it is believed that breaking the speed limit by such a margin poses a serious threat to other road users. Andrew Howard, the AA's head of road safety, said: 'Driving at 100mph is not a minor slip. Everyone knows the national speed limit'. 'This means the worst drivers will be properly tested being allowed back on the road.' Ministers announced last week that habitual drink drivers could have their cars seized as the Government attempts to tackle the problem of people getting behind the wheel when over the limit. The move came after alarming figures revealed that a steep rise of motorists being convicted more than once for drink-driving offences. Startling figures show that in 2000, 13,299 motorists received a second ban for drink driving - and this figure soared to 19,605 by 2009. During this period, those disqualified from driving for at least the second time rose to 24 per cent from 16 per cent. Drivers will lose the right to demand a second blood or urine test if they are found to be even fractionally over the limit when breathalysed. This move is meant to clamp down on a loophole that means people can sober up while they await their new test.

An extended test lasts up to 85 minutes – double the length of that faced by normal learner – and costs £124 rather than the normal fee of £62. The extended tests themselves are likely to be overhauled to take into account the offence which led to disqualification in the first place. The initiative was welcomed by Robert Gifford, executive director of the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety. He told the Daily Telegraph: 'This is a timely move to ensure that the requirement to take an extended driving test also has an educational dimension. 'Carrying a driving licence is a significant responsibility and drivers need to be reminded of that. This should ensure that the extended driving test for serious offenders is fit for purpose.' The proposals to increase the number of motorists being forced to take an extended test are included in a consultation unveiled by the Department for Transport intended to tighten the law on a range of motoring offences. They are included in a package of measures which include a move to close the loophole that gives drivers marginally over the limit enough time to sober up and avoid a ban. This will be done by removing their right to demand a second blood or urine test which, especially in rural areas, can take up to two hours to perform.","DfT proposal extends range of offences where tests are required .

Long Island congressman Peter King and Steve Israel announced they were requesting the Army Corps of Engineers and Energy Department take over the work of getting power back on in the embattled neighborhood calling the attempts of Long Island Power Authority 'abysmal.' 150,000 homes and businesses on Long Island are still without power, with as many as 60,000 so flood-damaged that extensive repairs are needed before workers can even begin the process of restoring power, Long Island Power Authority said.

Drivers in New York City and on Long Island have been lining up at gas stations since before dawn after fuel rationing was enforced in the city for the first time since the early 1970s.

He described the emergency order as the best way to cut down the lines and help customers buy gas faster. Out-of-state drivers are also subject to the system and Mayor Bloomberg said the shortages could last another couple of weeks. The temporary law is similar to the . one that New Jersey Gov.

The long lines and frayed nerves at gas stations in New York and New Jersey has revived memories for some of the crippling Arab oil embargo of 1973, the last time that gasoline was rationed in New York. That crisis started in October 1973, when the Arab oil-producing states imposed an embargo against nations supporting Israel in the Fourth Arab-Israeli War, also known as Yom Kippur. The oil embargo, and the cut in production that accompanied it, doubled the price of crude and reduced overall supply. That forced gasoline prices to skyrocket at the pump and led to rationing and prompted Washington to question its reliance on Arab oil in a region known for its instability. Long gas station lines and frustrated motorists became iconic images of the early 1970s. The embargo eventually end in March 1974.","Gas rationing started at 6am in New York City, 5am in Long Island .

A wounded veteran who was injured in the deadly Texas train crash last week says the victims aboard a doomed tractor trailer rig had just a split-second before they were struck by a train. Sergent First Class Richard Sanchez was at the front of the trailer with his wife when someone on board yelled 'Train!' The wounded serviceman appeared on the Today show to speak about the horrific crash in Midland on Thursday night that killed four veterans and injured 16 others -- including at least one woman whose leg had to be amputated. Sgt Sanchez said he had just enough time to push his wife off the trailer before the speeding engine smashed into the veterans. Scroll down for video . Injured: First Sergent Richard Sanchez broke his back in the train crash after pushing his wife Heather to safety . 'There's not really any delay in time, the first time I heard somebody yelling train, me pushing her and me getting thrown,' he recounted. 'It all seems to go by extremely fast,' he said. Sanchez added the he was struck in the chest by the crossing arm as it lowered -- just moments before impact. The National Transportation Safety Board found that the train crossing signals only began flashing 20 seconds before the train hit and that the train engineer hit the brakes only five seconds before impact -- not nearly enough time to stop. The crossing arms at the intersection began to lower 13 seconds before the train crossed through the intersection. As the arms began to come down, 12 seconds before impact, the truck drove across the tracks. The cab and the very front of the trailer crossed to safety, but the midsection was directly in the path of the speeding train, the NTSB found. 'Heroes on Board': This is a shot of the tragic parade float just moments before it was wrecked and destroyed by a train .

He wasn’t moving, didn’t look like he was breathing, there was blood everywhere,' Sgt Sanchez's wife Heather said. He suffered a broken back and cannot walk until the swelling around his spine goes down, he told Today. She lost her composure as she recalled the horror of the day. Kansas-based lawyer David Pottroff, who specializes in train crashes, said the train warning system was designed to activate 30 seconds before the train crosses an intersection. The signals in place gave on 20 seconds warning. However, the NTSB said they all functioned how they were supposed to. On Saturday, 300 people attended a vigil on Saturday evening in downtown Midland. The attendees lit white candles and prayed for the victims' families and the community as a whole.

Four veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan were killed and 16 more people were injured when the train crashed into the flatbed truck in West Texas. It was the second of two floats carrying veterans in Thursday's parade in Midland. The first was exiting the tracks when the warning bells and signals were activated, 20 seconds before the accident, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The second float did not enter the tracks until several seconds after the warning system went off, the NTSB said. By that time, the guardrail was lowering.

'Once the crossing becomes active, people should stop,' lead investigator Robert Accetta with the NTSB said at a news conference on Saturday afternoon. The timeline was pieced together by combining information from a video camera mounted on the front of the train, another one on a sheriff's car and a data recorder that acts like an airplane's black box, activating when the train blared the horn, NTSB member Mark Rosekind said. Nine seconds before the crash, the train sounded its horn, a blaring that lasted four seconds, according to Rosekind. The guardrail hit the truck, then the engineer pulled the emergency brake, trying to bring the train that was traveling at 62mph to screeching halt. People on the first float and dozens of others who had come out to greet the veterans shrieked and watched in shock, as some aboard the truck tried to jump off, witnesses said. The veterans' military instincts kicked in as they treated the wounded. Devastation: A train smashed into this flatbed trailer carrying dozens of veterans and their spouses on Thursday evening . The NTSB has also interviewed the engineer and conductor, and established the train's air brakes were working, Mr Rosekind said. No mechanical problems were found with the cars. A review of the train's maintenance history found no defects, he added. The tracks also had no problems. Investigators will try to establish on Monday what the engine could have seen as it approached the truck. Part of the investigation includes whether the parade had the proper permit. The parade has been an annual event in Midland for nine years, but City Manager Courtney Sharp declined to say whether the group, Show of Support/Hunt for Heroes, had the necessary paperwork to hold the event. Railroads are a vital part of Midland, a town that sits in the heart of Texas' oil rich Permian basin. Three or four tracks lie within city limits, and the site of the accident is just about 10 minutes from downtown. 'We take all steps into consideration when we permit,' Mr Sharp said. 'I hate to go down that track until all of the investigation is over, but yes we do take that stuff into account.'

A court ruling has given fresh hope to seven RAF gunners suing a company that allegedly made them ill by exposing them to a toxic chemical in Iraq. A US jury found the Texas-based defence contractor KBR was negligent in exposing 12 American troops to hexavalent chromium, which can cause cancer and severe lung, liver and kidney damage. The soldiers, who were each awarded £4.4million in damages, were guarding the Qarmat Ali water plant near Basra where the chemical was used in work being carried out by KBR in 2003. Iraq: A British soldier in the southern Iraqi city of Basra. The Qarmat Ali water plant, which the RAF servicemen guarded, is close to the city . Their lawyer Mike Doyle said the verdict in Portland, Oregon, was important for the British servicemen, who were also involved in guarding the plant and are suing the firm in a separate case. He added: ‘KBR is being held accountable at last for putting profits above the welfare of the soldiers.’ The RAF gunners claim they were left unprotected against the chemical even though KBR managers knew about its presence for ‘months and months’. Their lawsuit, filed in the West Virginia federal court, says: ‘KBR managers disregarded and downplayed the extreme danger of wholesale site contamination.’ Bags of sodium dichromate – which contains hexavalent chromium, used as an anti-corrosive in pipes – were ripped open, allowing the substance to spread across the plant and into the air. When servicemen at the site began to get nosebleeds – a symptom of hexavalent chromium poisoning known as ‘chrome nose’ – KBR managers allegedly blamed it on the ‘dry desert air’ or claimed they were ‘allergic to sand’. Damage: Hexavalent chromium can damage the kidneys and other internal organs (file picture) Former RAF sergeant Andrew Tosh, 45, from Lincoln, who did numerous 24-hour shifts at the water plant when he was deployed to Iraq in May 2003 with 26 Squadron RAF Regiment, said he still suffers from skin rashes and prolonged chest infections that started while he was there. ‘The chemical swirled around after being blown out of split sacks by the wind. It was everywhere,’ said the father of two, a 23-year veteran of the RAF. ‘We were living in it, breathing it and sleeping in it. It was in our food and water.’ John Caunt, 35, from Sutton-in-Ashfield near Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, said: ‘I’m terrified of contracting a serious disease and not being able to support my family. The fear hangs over me all the time.’ Their lawsuit is expected to be heard next year. KBR denies the allegations and is expected to appeal against the first verdict.

These images show the the poignant final moments of Hannah Windsor, caught on CCTV as she walks to a secret meeting with her boyfriend, seemingly without a care in the world. Within hours she would be dead; tortured and murdered in a sustained brutal attack at his hands. 'Sadistic' Adam Lewis, 18, tied the 17-year-old college student to a tree, sexually assaulted her, strangled her and attacked her with a knife. He has now been jailed for at least 22 years for the killing. Lewis, of Wirral, Merseyside, had denied murdering Miss Windsor but changed his plea to guilty shortly before his trial at Liverpool Crown Court was due to begin. Final moments: Hannah Windsor, 17, was caught on CCTV walking up Bidston Hill, Wirral, to the campsite of boyfriend Adam Lewis, 18 . He also admitted two counts of sexual assault against his victim. Sentencing . Lewis to life imprisonment today, Mr Justice Holroyde told him: 'Only . you know what you did to Hannah and in what order you did it. 'It . is, however, clear that you deliberately inflicted cruel injuries upon . her which must have caused her immense pain and suffering.' Lewis, . who has learning difficulties and a low IQ, showed no emotion as the . judge told him the pathologist’s report into Hannah’s death made . 'chilling reading'. The . partially clothed body of Miss Windsor, who was living at a hostel for . homeless young people at the time of her death, was found hidden under . leaves, twigs and dirt in woodland on Bidston Hill, Wirral, on May 19 . this year. Neil Flewitt QC, prosecuting, described Miss Windsor’s injuries as 'highly distressing'. She . was restrained and tied to a tree, sexually assaulted, stabbed . repeatedly and suffered multiple other knife wounds to her chest, . abdomen and back, he said. Sadistic: Defenceless Hannah Windsor, left, was tied to a tree by evil Adam Lewis, right, and subjected to a horrific and sustained attack which continued after her death, Liverpool Crown Court heard . Relief: Hannah's mother Gaynor Murray hugs the girl's father, Paul Windsor, after sentencing . Her mouth had been covered with surgical tape and she was strangled with a combination of his hands and a ligature, Mr Flewitt added. There were also severe wounds in her genital area and evidence of sexual assaults. 'The nature and extent of the injuries were such that the pathologist concluded Hannah had been the victim of torture,' Mr Flewitt told the court. 'In the pathologist’s opinion, some of the wounds have a sexual component. 'Some of the injuries were caused after death but some were definitely caused during life. 'It is entirely possible that at some stage during the process, Hannah died and the defendant did not realise she had died and continued to inflict the injuries.' During sentencing, the judge added: 'Adam Lewis, that was a prolonged, merciless and terrible attack, which must have been agonisingly painful for Hannah Windsor before she died. 'You must have known what dreadful pain you were causing her.' The judge said Lewis showed 'dreadful cruelty' and added: 'I am quite sure that your murder of Hannah Windsor involved both a sexual and sadistic element.' Members of Hannah’s family sobbed as they followed proceedings from the public gallery. Horrific discovery: Police at a murder scene, near Bidston Observatory at Bidston Hill in Wirral, Merseyside Liverpool, where the body of Hannah Windsor was found . The judge said: 'In every crime of murder, one life is taken but many others are damaged. 'I have read and taken account of statements by both of Hannah’s parents. They, and other members of her family and friends, have suffered and will continue to suffer as a result of what you did.' Miss Windsor and Lewis, who were both diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), had met when they were pupils at a Wirral special school. After leaving school they had been in a relationship for seven months before splitting up and reuniting about six weeks before he killed her, the court heard. In the days leading up to Miss Windsor’s death Lewis had been hiding from police after a burglary during which he started a fire. He was sleeping in a tent which he pitched in a woodland clearing on Bidston Hill, a beauty spot on the outskirts of Birkenhead. Police became aware that Miss Windsor knew where Lewis was hiding and warned her not to go and see him, Mr Flewitt said. 'Tragically, it seems Hannah was . determined to ignore the advice she had been given by police and was . intending to visit the defendant at his campsite,' he added. Miss Windsor was carrying a note from a detective which contained a phone number for her local police station. The note was later found torn up at Lewis’s campsite, Mr Flewitt said. 'Torture': Sadistic Lewis tied Miss Windsor to a tree near the beauty spot at Bidston Hill, pictured, in Wirral, Merseyside Liverpool, before sadistically attacking her . 'It may be that the presence of this torn note around the campsite indicated to the defendant that she had been speaking to police and may in part explain why he attacked and killed her,' the barrister told the court. Two days after Miss Windsor disappeared Lewis was found by police sleeping rough at a railway station. A search of the police national computer revealed he was wanted for burglary and arson and he was arrested before being released on bail. While on bail he told his sister he had killed Miss Windsor and his grandfather contacted police. Lewis was re-arrested and taken to Bidston Hill where he directed police to an area near where Miss Windsor’s body was found. Lewis’s . previous convictions date from the age of 10 when he committed an . offence of dishonesty. Other offences included an assault committed when . he was 13, the court was told. He . earlier pleaded guilty to the burglary he committed before he killed . Miss Windsor. This will be his third burglary conviction and will result . in a mandatory three-year jail term, Mr Flewitt said. The barrister acknowledged that the . burglary sentence will 'pale in comparison' to the life sentence he will . receive for the murder. In . mitigation, Stephen Riordan QC, defending, said Lewis confessed to the . murder last Friday during a meeting with his solicitor. Harrowing: Liverpool Crown Court, pictured, heard 'distressing' details of the savage attack launched by Adam Lewis on his girlfriend Hannah Windsor . He maintains he suffered a blackout and cannot recall much of what happened. Mr . Riordan said: 'The time may come, and one hopes it will, when he may . face the enormity of what happened. But that time is not yet with us.' As well as being diagnosed with ADHD, Lewis has a number of 'mental difficulties', his barrister said. 'His mental age is low and his cognitive skills are very poor,' Mr Riordan told the court. He added that psychiatric reports reveal the defendant has an IQ in the region of 55 or 56 and a mental age of nine or 10. He is also considered 'alcohol dependent' and 'shows evidence of harmful use of cannabis', the court heard. One of Miss Windsor’s relatives walked out of court as Mr Riordan said Lewis offered them his 'sincere condolences'. Outside the court Hannah’s mother, Gaynor Murray, burst into tears and said her family “could now find peace'.She said: 'He deserved what he got and I’m so made up. 'It’s the best day of my life now we can finally mourn in peace for Hannah. 'She was lovely, the smile on her face was unbelievable and she always tried to help everyone - she was my baby. 'I hate him, I never ever use that word but I hate him. It’s never going to bring my little girl back but I’ve got justice today.' Det Insp Mark Tivendale said: 'On behalf of Merseyside Police I would like to offer my sincere condolences to Hannah’s family. 'They have shown great dignity throughout this investigation. 'Hannah was in the prime of her life. She should have been looking forward to the rest of her life but that was taken from her by Adam Lewis. 'The sentence today willl not bring Hannah back but I hope the conclusion of this case will bring some closure to Hannah’s family and friends.'","Hannah Windsor had been bound and gagged with surgical tape .

Alan Davies tonight apologised to Lord McAlpine for naming him over false child abuse allegations. The 46-year-old BBC comedian wrote to the former Tory politician, whose legal team is continuing its process of suing everybody who wrongly linked him to allegations of historic child abuse. The claims were sparked by a Newsnight report which did not name Lord McAlpine but referred to a senior Conservative from the Thatcher era, leading to his identification online. Scroll down for video . Letter sent: Alan Davies (left) has apologised to Lord McAlpine (right) for naming him over false abuse claims . Mr Davies told his 444,000 followers on Twitter: ‘I've just written to Lord McAlpine to apologise for retweeting his name in relation to false allegations following a BBC investigation.’ It came after the Jonathan Creek and QI star had tweeted: ‘Any clues as to who the Tory paedophile is?’ and then retweeted a response naming Lord McAlpine. Last week the BBC agreed to pay the peer £185,000 for wrongly implicating him in a paedophile ring that targeted children at the care home in Wrexham, north Wales. But Twitter users had already taken to the website to tweet or retweet the libellous allegations. Sally Bercow, the outspoken wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow, is another Twitter user who Lord McAlpine's lawyers are considering suing. Mrs Bercow wrote on November 4: ‘Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *innocent face*.’ But she has defended her tweet, describing it as not libellous - ‘just foolish’. I'm sorry: Mr Davies told his 444,000 followers on Twitter that he had written to Lord McAlpine to apologise . Then on Friday she tweeted: ‘Yes had letter from Lord McA. His lawyers ambulance chasers tbh [to be honest] #bigbullies.’ She later added: ‘I don’t have money to contest a multi-millionaire. Lord McA falsely accused but not by me. 'I've just written to Lord McAlpine to apologise for retweeting his name in relation to false allegations following a BBC investigation' Alan Davies . ‘Loving my trial by tabloid, mind. I never said Lord McAlpine paedophile – just noted he trending. Nor did I tweet about *that* Newsnight. This is totally politically motivated, I tell you. And I don’t do conspiracy theories as a rule.’ She went on: ‘Night twitter.

He has also previously confirmed that a ‘very long list’ of Twitter users had been compiled which included Mrs Bercow and journalist George Monbiot, who has already apologised. This . was the extraordinary moment Philip Scholfield handed a list of alleged paedophiles . to David Cameron - which Lord McAlpine's lawyer says 'destroyed' his . client's reputation in the process . Lord McAlpine is also seeking damages . from ITV, which sparked fury after This Morning presenter Phillip . Schofield confronted the Prime Minister with a list of names of alleged . abusers. Mr Schofield had . found the names on the internet and asked David Cameron if he would . investigate. The peer's legal team have said they want more from ITV than . the £185,000 paid by the BBC. 'He would be looking for substantially more damages (from ITV) than the £185,000 he got from the BBC because it is a large private organisation and not taxpayer-funded. Up to £500,000 is what they are looking at' Source close to Lord McAlpine . Mr Reid said the presenter 'embarrassed the Prime . Minister and destroyed the reputation of my client' and has sent a . 15-page letter to ITV encouraging them to settle. The . former Tory treasurer said because the BBC is publicly-funded he . tempered the claim made against them. But because ITV is a private . company he is looking for a huge damages deal. A . source close to the peer told MailOnline: ‘He would be looking for . substantially more damages than the £185,000 he got from the BBC because . it is a large private organisation and not taxpayer-funded. Up to . £500,000 is what they are looking at.' Lawyers said the Lord McAlpine, pictured, case could potentially involve the largest number of defendants in British legal history . The . peer’s lawyers have identified 1,000 ‘original’ tweets and a further . 9,000 retweets, which is when a user re-posts a comment sent to them. 'Twitter is not a place where you can gossip and say the nastiest things possible with impunity' Andrew Reid, Lord McAlpine's solicitor . About 40 of these potential defendants have so far approached the peer’s lawyers to apologise. Mr . Reid previously warned that tweeters, even those who deleted their . accounts or messages, will be contacted so should come forward. He added that it was time to clamp down on Twitter, which allowed people to say 'vile, disgusting' things. 'We . have been inundated by the public who have wanted us to deal with this . problem of Twitter, and have encouraged and in some cases have actually . offered us funds,’ he said. 'Twitter is not a place where you can gossip and say the nastiest things possible with impunity. BBC controversy: Lord McAlpine announced last week that he is taking landmark legal action against internet gossips who falsely branded him a paedophile after BBC's Newsnight broadcast the wrong claims . Mistake: Sally Bercow took to Twitter to comment on speculation as to the identity of the Tory at the centre of a Newsnight investigation and could be sued . 'We've . been watching people who have been taking down what they put on . Twitter. What they don't seem to understand is that once it's there, you . can't take it down and what's more we really have all the information.’ Twitter said that information about its users that is not public will not be revealed unless they are legally required to do so. It . added that to obtain information that is not public – including the . full name of the Twitter user and their address - would require a . witness summons, a court order or another valid legal process. Without . any of these, only the Twitter user’s ID – which could be a pseudonym – . and any other information they have willing disclosed will be . available. Lord McAlpine could now apply for an order which would enable them to obtain the private details of users who tweeted about him. Christopher . Hutchings, a privacy lawyer, said: ‘In the case of Lord McAlpine, the . mere seriousness of the libel would mean applying for a court order . would be a straightforward application.’ His legal team plans to make each of them pay a nominal sum of possibly £5 to a children’s charity.

Callous thieves were caught on CCTV snatching a collection tin in memory of a young man who died of an epilepsy-related condition. Teaching assistant and sports coach Matt Boardman, 22, died in February of Sudden Unexpected Death In Epilepsy (SUDEP). His father Paul arranged for the collection tin in a Bargain Booze shop in Blackburn, Lancashire - where Matt worked part-time - to raise funds for charity Epilepsy Bereaved. Scroll down for video . Heartless: This woman, believed to be in her thirties and walking with a stick, was caught on CCTV stealing a collection tin in memory of Matt Boardman, 22, in a Blackburn branch of Bargain Booze . Accomplice: The woman was accompanied by a shaven-headed man, caught on film here, who distracted a shop assistant while she pounced . 'Appalled': Paul Boardman, Matt's father, questioned how anyone could stoop so low as to steal a collection tin . But a dark-haired woman, aged about 30, can clearly be seen in video footage taking the tin from the shop counter, as a shaven-headed male accomplice waits in the background. Paul, of Darwen in Lancashire, said he was 'appalled' somebody had stolen the donated cash. 'I am disgusted that somebody could stoop so low as to pinch this money,' he said. 'It isn't just any charity box, it is personal and means a lot to a lot of people. 'I hope they get caught. It is outrageous. 'It doesn't matter how much they took. Whether it was £1 or £1,000 - it is disgusting.' CCTV recordings show the woman, who was wearing a blue fleece, black tracksuit pants and walked with a stick, entering the shop. She was closely followed by a tall, forty-something man wearing a black jacket and shoulder bag. While he asked the shop assistant about some wine, the woman, who had been circling the shop, grabbed the charity box and walked out. She then ran away in the direction of Ewood, with the man following soon after without buying anything. It is thought there was about £80 in the collection box. A notice has now been placed on the counter, alongside a photograph of the thief. It reads: 'A special thank you to the thief who stole the collection box that stood here. 'Hope you are proud of yourself. 'Apologies to all who had contributed to SUDEP, we do appreciate your help.' Bargain Booze store manager Jane . Wright said staff had been left devastated after the theft, which took . place at 2.45pm on Sunday. 'Matt was a close friend to all the staff and knew a lot of our regular customers. 'It is infuriating and sickening that this could happen.' Quick exit: The accomplice was wearing a black jacket and trousers and carrying a white shoulder bag . Notice: This message and a CCTV picture of the thief are on the counter of the Bargain Booze store . Jane Hanna, director of Epilepsy Bereaved, said: 'I would plead to the people who have taken this money to turn themselves in to the police. 'If they don't, they are causing the family, who have suffered a terrible tragedy, even more pain. 'They are also taking away vital funds from Epilepsy Bereaved, which is working with bereaved families and researchers across the UK to prevent deaths.' Matt, a keen Blackburn Rovers fan, was found in bed at 7pm on February 1 by his parents Paul and Diana Boardman when they went to wake him up to go and watch Blackburn play Newcastle United at Ewood Park. His devastated family, including brothers Mikey, 20, and Niall, 11, were stunned at his death. Matt was diagnosed with epilepsy aged 19, but despite being unable to drive because of the condition, he lived life to the full.

'We can't declare him brain dead,' he said. 'We're going to ask the people of Puerto Rico to keep praying.' Scroll down for video . Shot: Camacho was rushed to Centro Medico, the trauma center in San Juan, where he was in critical but stable condition . Ambush: The body of a man who was in the car with the champion boxer, believed to be his driver, lies on the ground following the shooting as police look on . Bout: Hector Camacho, right, throws a punch at Troy Lowry in a 2001 fight . Torres said doctors will conduct additional tests early Thursday but warned the prognosis remains dire. 'The changes have been more negative than positive,' he said, adding . that Camacho does not have enough blood coursing through his brain. Doctors initially had said Camacho was in critical, but stable . condition and expected to survive after he was shot Tuesday night in the . city of Bayamon.

Police said two assailants fled in an SUV but no . arrests have been made and no motive has been disclosed. Camacho was rushed to Centro Medico, where doctors initially said the . bullet passed through his jaw and lodged in his shoulder. Torres said . the bullet damaged three of the four main arteries in his neck and . fractured two vertebrae, which could leave him paralyzed if he were to . survive. Steve Tannenbaum, who has also represented Camacho in the past, had . been told earlier by friends at the hospital that the boxer would make . it. 'This guy is a cat with nine lives.

Although an exact cause of death has yet to be established, Mr Proctor was dead before the fire started. Officers also released a CCTV image of Mr Proctor using a cash machine at Tesco near his home on Whalley New Road at around 3:00pm on Friday 9th November - 12 hours before the fire. It is believed to be the last sighting of him alive. Det Supt Paul Withers, who is leading the investigation, said: 'We believe that Christopher Proctor may have been targeted over several years by people taking advantage of his vulnerability. 'In the early hours of the morning shortly before the fire we know that someone tried to use his Nat West bank card at two cash points, first at the Tesco Express store on Whalley New Road at shortly before 2.15am and then a short time later at the Post Office at Brownhill roundabout at 2.25am.

Although at the time he was 80, he agreed to act as the 'getaway driver' for the couple and was subsequently arrested. The . tragedy unfolded at 4am on Saturday November 10 after firefighters were . called to Mr Proctor’s property in Pleckgate Road, Blackburn, in the . early hours after a passerby raised the alarm. Eye . witness Soyaid Patel, 26, said: 'I was with a friend on my way home . when we saw an orange glow in the distance and as we got closer we . realised it was a fire. 'We moved towards the fire shouting to . see if anyone was inside but there was no answer. As we got within a . couple of feet the windows blew out.

Pandora and Spotify are online music streaming services with millions of users around the globe. Spotify has a catalogue of 15 million songs and offers both a free service with advertisement and paid-for streaming. The catalogue can be browsed by searching for an artist or a song but also by genre or user-generated playlists.

Despite their superstar backer, the new owners Interactive Media Holdings have yet to turn a real profit for MySpace. Although MySpace has seen an increase in traffic by 36 per cent since December 2011, it only generated a mere $15 million in revenues this year. The leaked presentation is optimistic about . the future, predicting that the $50 million can turn the MySpace into a . Spotify killer despite recording a $43 million loss in 2012. The company intends to spend $10 . million on advertisement alone and plan to launch a mobile phone app . where users can subscribe to their music streaming services, according . to the presentation leaked to Business Insider.

Debra Bratt, from Hartlepool, opened her eyes to see creepy crawlies, of all shapes and sizes, swarming all over the beds. 'It was an absolute nightmare' she said. 'To think that they had been crawling around us while we were asleep is absolutely awful and now I’m covered in these bites. 'We had been watching 'I’m A Celebrity' earlier in the night and when I woke up I felt like I was in a Bushtucker Trial.' Disgusted: Mother-of-two Debra Bratt woke up to find her London hotel room swarming with bed bugs . Ms Bratt said: 'I woke up and put the light on and all three beds were covered. I was just trying to get all of the bugs off the beds but there were so many of them.' Ms Bratt says she now can’t shut her eyes at night without seeing the ‘awful’ image of the insects crawling everywhere. She later had to be treated with antibiotics after the bug bites became infected. A letter sent to Ms Bratt from the hotel confirmed that the room was found to be infested with bed bugs after an investigation. They said the room has since been treated by a pest control company and will continue to be monitored. Ms Bratt had been visiting her younger sister, Sharon Abbey, in London with her two other sisters, Sue Cook and Julie Porritt, when their journey home encountered problems. Shocked: Debra Bratt says she can't get the 'awful' image of the bed bugs out of her head . 'Nightmare': Ms Bratt said she woke in her Travelodge hotel room in London to find creepy crawlies swarming over her bed . After one tube station was closed, Mrs Bratt’s sister Sue was feeling ill and with a journey back to the other side of London to Sharon’s house not viable, they decided to book a room in the nearest Travelodge. They all went straight to bed, but when Mrs Bratt woke up in the early hours she discovered the gruesome sight. Mrs Bratt said: 'I woke Julie up straight away but I didn’t want to wake Sue up because she really hadn’t been very well at all and she needed her sleep.' Terror: Debra said her ordeal was reminiscent of the Bug Burial recently endured by Nadine Dorris on the TV show 'I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!' Careworker Mrs Bratt went to the hotel reception at 7am with a tissue full of the insects she found in her room. She said: 'I didn’t want to cause a scene but I explained the situation to them. 'The woman on reception asked me why I didn’t come and tell them straight away but I explained that my sister had been really ill and I didn’t want to disturb her, and I had some of the bugs in the tissue to show them.' Travelodge agreed to refund the sisters for the room but days later Mrs Bratt began to notice dozens of bites coming out all over her body. She was told by doctors the bites were infected, and is now on a course of antibiotics. Mrs Bratt added: “It was just an absolute nightmare. A Travelodge spokeswoman said: 'We are doing everything we can to help the customer and we hope to be able to work with her to get an outcome she is happy with.'","Debra Bratt woke up to find bugs all over the beds in London hotel room .

Killed: A 21-year-old Walmart attendant has been charged with raping and murdering homecoming queen Brenna Morgart, pictured . A 21-year-old Walmart attendant has been charged with raping and murdering a Kansas homecoming queen then dumping her body in a field. Dustin Leftwich could face the death penalty if convicted of capital murder in the slaying of 18-year-old Brenna Morgart. The Topeka man was initially charged with premeditated first-degree murder but the charge was upgraded on Wednesday after new evidence came to light, which added rape to his long list of indictments. Ms Morgart, a Sunday school teacher and cross-country runner, was found dead on May 25, just five days after graduating from Seaman High School. Her family reported her missing at around 3.45pm when she failed to return after going on a jog about 10am. Police said she was killed after being struck by a car on Jennings Road, three miles from where her body was found. Besides the murder and rape charges, Mr Leftwich is also charged with the aggravated kidnapping of Ms Morgart, aggravated battery and misdemeanor reporting false information tied to the vehicular accident in connection with her death. He has pleaded not guilty to the kidnapping and murder charges, according to the Topeka Capital-Journal. If Mr Leftwich is convicted of capital murder, a jury would decide whether to recommend the death penalty. The judge would make the final decision on whether to sentence Mr Leftwich to death or to life in prison without parole. Charges: Dustin Leftwich, pictured, faces charges of rape and capital murder in the death of 18-year-old Brenna Morgart . After Wednesday's hearing, District Attorney Chad Taylor told the Capital-Journal that his office decided to file the capital murder charge 'when (it) received further results in the investigation.' He didn't elaborate on what those results were. On July 16, the judge had ruled prosecutors could conduct DNA testing on potential evidence. The evidence included possible seminal fluid and blood found on underwear, a rape kit, and finger swipe marks on the inside of a vehicle trunk. Mr Leftwich is also facing an aggravated assault with a deadly weapon charge stemming from a separate incident on June 29, 2011 in which he allegedly ran down a 14-year-old girl with his car. In 2009, he was convicted of sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl and had 10 days left on his probation when he was arrested in the slaying of Ms Morgart. Mr Leftwich lives at home with his parents and sister and worked at Walmart for about a month before being arrested, earning $286 a week.

Among the objects going on display at the National Museum of Scotland are the hats reputedly worn by David Livingstone and journalist Henry Morton Stanley when they met in Africa in 1871, leading to the famous line: 'Dr Livingstone, I presume?'. The collection houses around 100 artefacts, documents and artworks - brought together for the first time - and charts Livingstone's life story from humble beginnings working in a cotton mill to becoming a missionary in Africa and building strong links between Scotland and Malawi.

Others are on loan from the David Livingstone Centre, the Royal Geographical Society, Glasgow Museums, the National Library of Scotland and private individuals. The cross on show was made from the wood of the tree under which Livingstone's heart was buried, after he died from dysentery and malaria in 1873, in what is today Zambia. The chief of the village where he passed away agreed to having the explorer's body returned to Britain but insisted that his 'heart belonged to Africa' - and it was duly cut out and interred at what is now the site of the Livingstone Memorial. Also on show are the tools of Livingstone’s trade, both as a missionary and an explorer. The collars and chains he removed from African slaves are testament to his vehement opposition to slavery.

After returning to Britain in 1864, he left for Africa once again two years later to find the source of the Nile - during which nothing was heard of him for several months. It was then that Henry Stanley sensed a scoop, and was commissioned by the New York Herald to find him. Born Rowlands in Denbigh, Wales in 1841, Stanley moved to America aged 18. While there, he found a rich benefactor, from whom he took his surname. Making history: Livingstone was the first European to cross Africa from west to east .

Remains: Pictured is a cast of Dr Livingstone's damaged bone after he had been attacked by a lion . The famous meeting of Stanley and Livingstone in Africa, 1871 . It has gone down in history as one of the most memorable greetings of all time. 'Doctor Livingstone, I presume', said Henry Stanley after months of searching the African bush for the long-lost explorer. Stanley made great capital out of his remark on 19th-century lecture tours, and it helped to make him a major celebrity. But he probably never said it at all, according to biographer Tim Jeal. In his 2007 book, Stanley: The Impossible Life of Africa's Greatest Exploree, Jeal says Stanley invented the phrase to help define his image as the archetypal reserved, stiff-upper-lipped English explorer. 'Stanley told lies, that is the problem,' said Jeal. 'And a liar can never subsequently tell the truth.' The son of a Welsh prostitute, Stanley re-invented himself several times, becoming first a newspaper correspondent in America, then an adventurer and explorer of the African continent before finally becoming a politician. It was while working for the New York Herald that he was asked to find the Scottish missionary explorer David Livingstone, who had been missing for five years. Stanley succeeded in locating him in 1871, in what is today Tanzania, to land one of the greatest scoops of the century. But his diary does not mention the greeting. It refers only to 'a pale-looking white man in a faded blue cap'. More tellingly, the next two pages have been ripped from the book. Jeal asked: 'Why else did he tear up those pages?' The author insisted he was not out to rubbish the reputation of Stanley and maintained he was a great man. 'He was our greatest land explorer and I can say that as I am Livingstone's biographer too,' he added. Jeal revealed that Stanley had always been impressed by the tight-lipped Englishness of army officers, and he particularly loved an anecdote about two English gentlemen who had passed each other in the wilds of Palestine and merely lifted their caps to each other. As a result he invented the famous phrase about his meeting with Livingstone, having asked himself the question: 'What would a gent have said?' The phrase first appeared in the New York Herald in 1872, and Stanley subsequently repeated it many times. A handwritten manuscript of a lecture was sold at Christie's in 1999 and gave a standard version of events: 'Doubtful of the temper he would receive me,' wrote Stanley, 'I simply bowed and said, ""Dr Livingstone, I presume?"" 'He held out his hand in token of kindly welcome and in a few minutes we became warm friends.'","100 artefacts brought together to mark 200th anniversary of his birth .

Stanley Marsh 3, who is famous for burying 10 vintage Cadillacs nose-down in an Amarillo field in the name of art, is facing a raft of lawsuits alleging he supplied the boys with cash, cars and alcohol in return for sexual favours. The lawsuits also claim the millionaire's wife, Wendy Marsh, and business partner David Weir, knew of the abuse and covered it up. Lawsuit: The eccentric Texas millionaire, Stanley Marsh 3, pictured left, has been accused of sexually abusing eight teenage boys and wife Wendy, right, allegedly knew about it . Mr Weir allegedly went as far as to force the boys to sign a waiver regarding his colleague's behaviour while they were in the office as employees or guests. Mr Marsh, who inherited his grandfather's oil and gas fortune and previously owned TV station KVII, is set to challenge the claims, which label him as a 'serial abuser' in court, according to The New York Times. The boys, aged 15, 16 and 17 at the time, are charging sexual assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress and are suing the 74-year-old for unspecified monetary damages. Amarillo police have interviewed six of the plaintiffs and searched Mr Marsh's offices, removing certain items, as part of a criminal investigation into the alleged abuse. Cadillacs: Mr Marsh is famous for burying 10 vintage Cadillacs nose-down in an Amarillo field, pictured . Mr Marsh's lawyer Kelly Utsinger told The Times his client was cooperating with the police. 'Any suggestions about the truth of these allegations needs to be reserved until the evidence is fully developed,' he said. 'We will file responsive pleadings that challenge and deny these allegations.' Mr Marsh put Amarillo on the map with the famous Cadilac Ranch he created in the 1970s. The bizarre attraction inspired a Bruce Springsteen song a decade later which only boosted its popularity. He is also known for owning a pig with tattooed wings on its sides. The city's residents are giving their millionaire neighbour the benefit of the doubt and not letting the allegations taint his mechanic masterpiece. Memorable: Mr Marsh put Amarillo on the map with the famous Cadilac Ranch he created in the 1970s . 'I think most people in Amarillo appreciate it as a work of art, and really don't think of it in the context of its donor any more than people concentrate on whatever Van Gogh's psychological problems were in appreciation of his art,' State Senator Kel Seliger, a Panhandle Republican and the city’s former four-term mayor, told The Times. 'One should always take allegations of indecency with a child seriously. But at this point they are just that, they're allegations.' But the allegations aren't the first he's faced relating to youngsters. Nearly 17 years ago, he was arrested on charges of kidnapping and aggravated assault after he was accused of threatening a high school student with a hammer and locking him in a chicken coop.

Crippling energy prices and badly insulated homes will lead to the loss of thousands of lives and seriously damage older people’s health this winter, warns a new report. It shows cold homes are costing the NHS £1.36 billion every year in hospital and primary care as older people struggle with respiratory problems, stroke and heart attacks triggered by the cold. Around 27,000 excess winter deaths are expected this year, including avoidable fatalities among older people, says the charity Age UK. In a new report The Cost of Cold, it says a ‘major factor’ in two out of five extra winter deaths is living in a cold home. It says superior building standards in countries like Finland and Sweden which insist on insulation and double glazing mean they have warmer homes than in the UK, which has a milder climate. There are higher rates of excess winter deaths - above what would normally be expected - in Britain compared with Scandinavian countries. Older people living in cold homes are at higher risk of death and illnesses such as arthritis and rheumatism, with the risks going up as temperatures plummet. There are around 8,000 extra deaths for every one degree drop in average temperature. Temperatures lower than 16 degrees appear to impair respiratory functions, those below 12 degrees place strain on the cardiovascular system and temperatures below six degrees place people at risk of hypothermia, say researchers. People living in the coldest homes are three times as likely to die from a cold-related illness compared to those in warmer homes, says the report. ‘The prevalence of poorly insulated homes coupled with sharp increases in energy prices over recent years has exacerbated the UK’s growing fuel poverty problem, forcing many older people to cut back on their heating in a bid to control costs’ says the report. Millions of older people are having to choose between staying warm and energy bills they can afford, the report warns . Michelle Mitchell, charity director general at Age UK said ‘It’s an absolute scandal that tens of thousands of older people will become ill or die this winter because they are unable to keep warm. ‘Not only is this resulting in an incalculable human cost but the NHS is spending more than a billion pounds on treating the casualties of cold every year. ‘At the root of the problem are badly insulated homes, which together with cripplingly high energy prices, are leaving millions of older people having to choose between staying warm and energy bills they can afford. ‘We are calling on all local authorities to recognise the issue as a major health priority and make sure they are doing everything within their power to keep older people warm. ‘The government must also invest in a major energy efficiency programme to help insulate older people against the cold weather and the high cost of energy’ she said. The Age UK report found two-fifths of people wrongly see hypothermia as the biggest threat to older people’s health in winter, as it accounts for only one in 100 excess winter deaths. The most common risk factor is cardiovascular diseases – strokes caused by blood-clotting or heart attacks – which account for 40 per cent of excess winter deaths. Last year a report found poor insulation means £1 in every £4 spent heating homes in Britain is wasted.","Age UK report says living in a cold home is a 'major factor' in two out of five extra winter deaths .

Brenda Smith, 63, needed a skin graft and spent eight days in a specialist burns unit. She leapt into a cold bath at her home in Westcliff, Essex, until paramedics arrived. 'I was in the bath for about an hour I . didn't want to get out it was so painful, the heat on my chest was . unbearable,' she said. Brenda Smith with the burst hot water bottle that left her with painful burns . Researchers at Anglia Ruskin University say that the numbers needing hospital treatment for hot water bottle burns has risen in the last two years. But they say these admissions only represent a handful of the true numbers suffering injuries as most will not go to hospital. The researchers say rising numbers of families are using . them as a 'cost-effective' way of staying warm in the hope of saving on . their energy bills. Another reason for the increase is that people are buying cheap hot water bottles from abroad made from rubber that easily perishes. Mrs Smith, 63, said: 'The hot water bottle I used was only about 14 months old. 'I will never use one again. I'd warn people to think twice about using them. Now I use a cherry stone or wheat bag for warmth.' Mrs Smith said she took a covered hot water bottle, that she had bought at a high street store, to bed after feeling unwell. But as she pulled it on to her chest the bottle split and hot water, poured from the kettle just half an hour earlier, emptied on her chest and down her left arm. Mrs Smith said: 'A five to six inch split just appeared and I was covered in hot water. 'I screamed for my partner to come up, I took my cotton top off and put cold flannels on. 'We rang NHS DIrect who advised me to get in a cold bath and call for an ambulance.' Mrs Smith had a skin graft at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford . Paramedics dressed her wound and took her to Southend Hospital where she was given morphine and from there she went to Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford, to be assessed. She added: 'They thought I may not need a skin graft, but when I went back for another appointment there was one patch on my left breast that had a deep burn. 'I ended up needing a skin graft taken from my thigh. It is still painful at the movement is difficult. The graft site on my thigh is also very sore.' Mrs Smith still has regular appointments at the St Andrew's Centre for Plastic Surgery and Burns at Broomfield Hospital. Quentin Frew, Visiting Clinical Fellow at Anglia Ruskin, said: 'It is clear there is a need to increase awareness of the ability of hot water bottles to cause significant long-term burn injuries. 'We encourage people to look for the Kitemark safety standard when buying hot water bottles.' The NHS does not compile figures on the numbers of patients needing treatment for hot water bottle burns.  But last year more than 1,800 were admitted to hospital following injuries caused by hot water or other hot fluids, which would include hot water bottles.","Hot water bottle split left Mrs Smith with burns on her chest and left arm .

A wealthy businessman who had his neighbour's 40ft tree chopped down because it was blocking his view of the sea from his hot tub has been fined a staggering £125,000. Neil Davey, 51, was found guilty of arranging to have the protected maritime pine felled while he was in Paris with his new wife Sheena. It is thought Davey - who arranged for a tree surgeon friend to sneak onto his neighbour's property in the dead of night and take a chainsaw to the towering tree - may have plotted the scheme as a post-honeymoon surprise for his bride. Guilty: Neil Davey was hit with a £125,000 fine after being found guilty of arranging to have his neighbour's protected tree felled . Arranging to have the 55-year-old tree removed simultaneously enhanced the views of Poole Harbour from the couple's sun terrace and boosted the value of their luxury property on the Dorset coast from £725,000 to £775,000. A judge told Davey that in tasking his friend Thomas McGuire with chopping down the tree under cover of darkness he had not only demonstrated 'a remarkable arrogance', but also put his neighbours' lives at risk. Davey, who owns an auctioneers in Poole, was ordered to pay out £50,000 to cover the amount added to the value of his property by the illegal act. He was also fined £75,000 and ordered to pay £14,500 in costs to Poole Council. Mystery: Davey was found guilty of arranging to have the protected tree felled . 'Remarkable arrogance': Having the tree chopped down gave Davey and his new bride an unobstructed view of Poole Harbour from their hot tub . Tree surgeon: Davey's friend Thomas McGuire crept onto his neighbour's property under cover of darkness to chop down the protected tree . Judge Peter Johnson said: 'This was a pre-meditated matter, not something that occurred on the spur of the moment. 'It is clear you, Neil Davey, were the main mover behind it. 'What you orchestrated demonstrated a remarkable arrogance. 'What you orchestrated demonstrated a remarkable arrogance' Judge Peter Johnson . 'In order to improve your view you arranged for your co-accused to go around to the tree in the dead of night and cut it down, putting your neighbours' lives at risk.' McGuire was fined a total of £5,515 for his part in the scheme. Davey had denied causing or permitting . the destruction of a tree and McGuire, from Bournemouth, pleaded not . guilty to the willful destruction of a tree. After the hearing at Bournemouth Crown Court Andy Dearing, Poole Council's planning enforcement officer, said there was strong evidence to suggest getting rid of the tree had been a wedding present for Davey's new wife. Mr Dearing said the 'reckless act' had been 'all for money and all for that view'. 'We believe it is the biggest fine in the country and it was a very robust sentence,' the planning officer added. Shock: Steve Bransgrove was woken by the revving of a chainsaw in the middle of the night . The court heard McGuire and Davey had known one another for around 10 years, and that the tree surgeon had been doing some work in Davey's garden in the weeks leading up to the incident. During the early hours of June 20, 2010, McGuire cut through the base of the healthy pine, which crashed down close to a building. Steve Bransgrove, the owner of the property with the protected tree on it, was roused from his sleep by the noise and raced out into the garden to investigate, but McGuire had fled. After being called out to investigate the mystery, Mr Dearing discovered a trail of flattened grass leading from the tree stump to the Daveys' back garden. Then the planning officer spotted the hot tub and some brand-new sun loungers on the couple's patio. 'I realised the owners now had perfect views of Poole Harbour, the Isle of Purbeck and Corfe Castle which had been obstructed by the tree in question,' he said at the time. Davey denied having anything to do with the damage and claimed he initially thought the wind had blown the tree over when he returned from honeymoon to find it gone. He admitted in court to lying to the police and council about how long and how well he had known McGuire. The tree surgeon had claimed he was in Yeovil at the time of the attack but was forced to admit he had been in Poole after a mobile phone mast registered his device there. The tree will now be replaced by another maritime pine. It is believed the owners of the property in question are planning civil action against Davey for the cost they incurred as a result of the destruction of the tree.","Neil Davey, 51, found guilty of arranging to have his neighbour's protected pine tree chopped down .

The 53-year-old overslept, saying that his alarm clock did not go off, and he barely made it to the Today Show studios in New York on Saturday in time for his hosting duties at the weekend morning program. His Weekend Today co-host, Jenna Wolfe, feared she would be left in a lurch but Holt managed to make it to NBC just 40 minutes before the show went live. Scroll down for video. You didn't set that: Weekend Today co-host Jenna Wolfe jokes with Lester Holt, who overslept on Saturday . Could we drop it? Lester Holt takes a beating on air from his co-host for barely making the show . Holt took to Twitter to alert viewers of his frazzled morning. 'For the first time in 9 yrs of hosting weekend @todayshow I overslept!' he posted on his Twitter account. After his Twitter message, one person responded, 'I would think at a big-time network someone would call you!' Well, that's exactly what happened. The executive producer for the show ended up giving Holt a wake-up call at 5:45 a.m and he made a mad dash from his apartment, in the Flatiron District in New York City, to 30 Rock in midtown Manhattan where the show goes live at 7:00 a.m. Are you coming? Jenna Wolfe wondered if she would be eastwooding, if Holt didn't make it in time . Given Holt's reputation as a consummate . professional in the news community, his colleague couldn't help but joke about his behavior since it was so out of character. 'Am I #eastwooding this morning??' his co-host Wolfe, 38, tweeted about his absence in the lead-up to the show, posting a . video of her sitting next to an empty chair. 'So guess who overslept this morning?' she said in the video. 'The hardest working man on television decided that he needed some beauty sleep. Yeah, he's still coming in, running a little late.' Wolfe was referencing the latest . internet craze inspired by a set-up arranged by actor Clint . Eastwood during his speech at the Republican National Convention, when . he spoke to an empty chair in a pretend conversation with President Barack Obama. Like a pro: Despite his frazzled morning, Lester Holt managed to seamlessly assume his hosting duties . And when Holt finally arrived at the studio, Wolfe couldn't help but make fun of his late start. 'My alarm didn't go off for the record,' he informed her, in a video caught by a member of the crew and posted online. 'Yeah I've heard that 'my alarm not going off' many times,' she said in response. But Holt insisted, 'I set it for 4:15 but it didn't go off.' 'Did your dog also eat your homework?' she joked, unwilling to cut him any slack. Uggh: Lester Holt looked less than pleased when he overslept and missed his train stop on a trip in England during the Olympics . And the hits just kept on comin' for Holt. Once Wolfe and Holt were in position and the show went live from Studio 1A, Wolfe wanted to make sure that viewers were also informed of Holt's morning mishap. 'You never do anything wrong so I have to bask in it a little,' she joked. Despite his condensed time to prep for the program, he managed to pull it all off beautifully. Indeed, Holt is coming off a busy summer - having helped the NBC News team in their coverage of the London 2012 Olympic Games. And sleep proved to be scarce for him during his stint across the pond. He was enjoying a nap on a train ride from London to Alnmouth, in the north of England, when he overslept, missed his stop and ended up in Scotland on August 7. He had to change trains four times over a time span of 9 hours to get back where he needed to be. But in his typical good humor, the newsman joked about the incident and shared it with his fans over Twitter. 'If ya gotta end up in the wrong place u can do worse than Edinburgh. Catching some quick sights,' he tweeted, adding that on his return trip he would be 'drinking LOTS of coffee.'

Monica Zapotoczny, 45, of Buenos Aires, has given birth to the twins from the eggs she had frozen at the age of 33 - surpassing the previous record of seven years. Mrs Zapotoczny and her husband 44-year-old Guillermo Husak, had thought that they would never have a child of their own after several failed attempts at IVF treatment. Miracle twins: Monica Zapotoczny gave birth to twins from eggs frozen for a record 12 years (file picture) Breakthrough: The news will be welcomed by cancer sufferers and career women putting off having children (file picture) The pair had one final attempt last year and Zapotoczny fell pregnant with non identical twins - Mercedes and Guadalupe, who were born in January by caesarian section. Although eggs have been frozen for up to two decades, they are susceptible to becoming damage as they become more fragile the older they get. As well as offering new hope to cancer survivors who are holding off having children, the news will come as a boost to career women who are having children later in life to focus on their job. Zapotoczny said: 'It was a miracle. The joy we feel is indescribable, our family is complete. I hope other women who freeze their eggs can take hope from this that their dreams can one day come true.' Around 1,000 babies have been born from frozen eggs worldwide with only 15 born in Britain in the last decade. Fertility specialist Gillian Lockwood of, Midland  Fertility Services, recommended that women have their eggs frozen in their twenties and early thirties as the number of high quality eggs produced will be greater. Lynne Featherstone, an international development minister who was in charge of equalities until September’s reshuffle, said childbirth was a ‘barrier’ to women’s career success, last week.

Businessmen should only be honoured by the Queen if there is evidence they have given their time or money to charity, a report claimed today. The government-backed study found that a number of entrepreneurs had been given titles despite putting relatively little back into the community. Over the past five years, 12 people ranging from chairmen to chief executives were awarded knighthoods and damehoods in the Queen's Birthday or New Year's honours lists where the citation only stated service to business. Recognising philanthropy: A Government-backed report is recommending that people should only be honoured by the Queen if they, like presenter Sir Bruce Forsyth (pictured), have given their time or money to charity . Figures from the Cabinet Office also suggest that more than a quarter of the 1,200 people on the last honour's list were not actively engaged in charitable or voluntary work. The report, by campaign group Legacy10, said honours should only be given when their work is explicitly linked to charity and not just as a reward for their professional achievements. It said: 'People nominated for honours in the field of business should need to provide firm evidence of charitable giving and/or volunteering of time.' It also recommends that the Government creates an additional honour to recognise 'individuals who have shown exceptional innovation in the field of legacy–giving', it was reported in the Daily Telegraph. Tightening up: A row erupted earlier this year when David Cameron (left) and head of the civil service Sir Bob Kerslake (right) announced rule changes to remove the automatic right of Olympic champions to an honour . Having to go the extra yard: Under the new guidelines, honours will go to gold medallists who have shown years of dedication and have used their public profile to 'give back to society' The study by Legacy10, which encourages people to make use of tax–free allowances in their wills to give more to charity, was commissioned by former Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt. A spokesman for Cabinet Office said: 'Honours are awarded on merit to those who make outstanding contributions and not for simply doing the day job. 'In the last list, just over 1,200 people received awards of which 72 per cent were actively engaged in charitable or voluntary work.' Earlier this year, the Mandarin in charge of selecting honours, Sir Bob Kerslake, revealed that Britain's Olympic medal–winners would have to show philanthropic achievement before they would be guaranteed a gong.

The spectacle began at around midday today, when he scaled the statue and broke off its hand, before throwing all his clothes to the ground. One witness, Richard, who owns a street souvenir stand, said he had been acting strangely before climbing onto the statue. He said: 'He was walking around this one acting weird, just sniffing around.

Experts fear the deadly disease threatening to devastate 80 million ash trees may have now spread to privately-owned gardens for the first time. At least two likely cases of the killer fungus have been discovered in back gardens and they have now been referred to plant inspectors for confirmation. Until now, ash dieback has been confined to Forestry Commission land, commercial plantings and nursery stock. In total, it has been confirmed at 200 sites, including 116 in mature woodlands. Forest fire: The Forestry Commission has started burning infected trees in a bid to stop the spread of ash dieback disease, but it has now spread to domestic gardens . The microscopic fungus - chalara fraxinea - is rife across mainland Europe. Experts now fear the disease will be more catastrophic than Dutch Elm Disease which killed 25 million trees here in the 1970s and 80s. Scientists believe the disease has been present in British woodland for at least two years, arriving through wind-blown spores from northern France and Belgium. As the tiny spores are transported on the breeze, it is virtually impossible to eradicate, and potential outbreaks in domestic trees will be grim news for gardeners. Homeowners worried that an ash tree on their land is infected should visit the Forestry Commission website, which has pictures and videos advising how to spot the disease. There is no known cure, but older trees will take years to die. The current advice is not to cut down an infected mature tree, but it is important to manage the leaf litter, as it is how the fungus spreads. Gardeners should attempt to dispose of the leaves within their own property, preferably on a bonfire, rather than transporting them elsewhere which may help spread the disease. Burn: Experts fear ash dieback could ravage Britain's 80 million ash trees . Toby Hammond, from the University of East Anglia, is behind the ashtag.org project, which allows the public to report suspected cases of the disease. These are then analysed by experts, with the most likely cases reported to Defra. After looking at thousands of images, the teams has identified 45 suspected sites, including one in west London. ‘We have received hundreds of reports over the past couple of weeks and we have had experts examining them to identity those that are likely to be Chalara,’ said Mr Hammond. 'We have so far identified 45 sites that are likely to have the disease.' ‘Two of these seem like they have been found in back gardens, but they all must now need to be confirmed by the plant health inspectors from Defra. ‘I suspect trees have been infected for some time and it could have arrived here up to five years ago which would explain why it is now so widespread. ‘I would urge the public to look at the guidance and take pictures of any suspicious leaves or trees and send them into us.’ More than 100,000 ash saplings have been destroyed in recent weeks, while the import and movement of trees has also been banned. Among those facing the unhappy task of destroying young plantings is broadcaster Selena Scott, who planted a wood at her Yorkshire farm as part of the Jubilee celebrations earlier this year. She is set to lose 5,000 ash amid concerns they are infected with the deadly fungus. ‘I have been in touch with the Woodland Trust and they are very concerned and will be advising me next week but from what they know of my situation they say the picture looks grim.’ The 61-year-old told the Sunday Telegraph. A common ash tree: The first confirmed case in the UK was in March 2012, and since then, dieback has been confirmed at a further 200 sites, with woodlands in Norfolk, Suffolk, Kent and Essex among the worst affected . ‘It’s devastating. The nursery where I bought the saplings seem unable to tell me whether they came from Holland or not but I fear anyway that I will have to cut them all down and dig up the roots. ‘That’s the message the conservationists are giving out. Can you imagine what a heartache that will be?’ A spokesman for Defra tonight said that none of the 200 confirmed cases were in private gardens. She said: ‘Our efforts are best placed concentrating on tackling the disease. If any cases are confirmed their place of origin will also be confirmed.’","Disease detected in gardens for first time .

France today ended its combat operations in Afghanistan, pulling hundreds of troops from a base in a volatile region northeast of Kabul and fulfilling promises to end its combat role on a faster track than other NATO allies. After a handover ceremony with Afghan troops, 500 French combat soldiers in trucks and armored vehicles left the Nijrab base in the Kapisa region, where anti-government insurgents have been active, and traveled southwest to Kabul, the capital, said Col. Thierry Burkhard, a French military spokesman. 'This is the end of combat operations,' Burkhard said, adding that the withdrawal went smoothly. 'It's the end of support operations for the Afghan National Army because we have no more troops who can deploy in such a role.' French General Eric De Hautecloque Raysz (right) and his Afghan counterpart, General Mohamad Zaman Wazari (left), salute the Afghan flag during a handover ceremony as part of the withdrawal of French troops . A French soldier holds the French national flag after the handover ceremony between the French army and the ANA (Afghan National Army). French combat troops are due to pull out of Afghanistan by the end of the year . France was once one of the largest contributors to the NATO mission in Afghanistan, with a peak deployment of 4,000 troops - though far smaller than the tens of thousands of U.S. troops there. Since mid-2008, French forces were deployed in Kapisa, a crescent-shaped and strategic region along mountains between Kabul and the Pakistani border. France already pulled out its forces from the neighboring Surobi district of Kabul province - a less violent area than Kapisa - earlier this year after then-President Nicolas Sarkozy said his country would pull combat troops out ahead of NATO's 2014 timetable for the U.S.-led combat operation to end. Withdrawal: At its peak deployment, France had 4,000 troops in Afghanistan . Replacement: Afghan National Army soldiers will now oversee operations in Kapisa . French public opinion has gradually soured on the ongoing Afghanistan mission, and a string of insurgent attacks that raised the French death toll preceded a decision by both Sarkozy and his successor to speed up the French withdrawal. France has lost 88 troops in Afghanistan since late 2001. Those that remain: British troops taking position in Helmand province. The UK has roughly 9,500 troops in Afghanistan . Tuesday's move put President Francois Hollande, who beat Sarkozy in a springtime presidential election, on track to make good on his campaign-trail promise to withdraw all French combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of this year. Hundreds of French troops were expected to fly out of Kabul in the coming weeks. France has been preparing such a handover for months, recently focusing on training Afghan forces instead of having French troops lead patrols in Kapisa. France had officially transferred the first command to the Afghan National Security Forces there in autumn last year, with French troops in a backup role. 'Today, the Afghan forces are capable of planning and conducting security operations in an autonomous way,' the French military said in a statement Tuesday. Jamie Graybeal, a spokesman for the international coalition, said it thanked France for its contribution and suggested the pullout would have no negative impact on allied operations.

One of the youngest sex offenders to be arrested for assaulting an adult has been sent on a sex education course. The 11-year-old Romanian boy forced his hands between his victim’s thighs after confronting her while she was out shopping. The boy, who has now turned 12 and cannot be named because of his age, then rode off on his bicycle. North London Youth Court has found an 11-year-old Romanian boy guilty of sexual assaulting an adult woman . He denied sexually assaulting the woman but was found guilty following a trial at North London Youth Court. The boy had given police a variety of different addresses before they tracked down him and his family. District Judge John Perkins handed him a nine-month youth rehabilitation order - the juvenile equivalent of a community order - and sent him on an educational course. Broad daylight: The assault took place in the early afternoon on Wycombe Road in Tottenham, North London . He said: ‘This was an unpleasant offence, and you continued to deny that you did this when in my view, the evidence was overwhelming. ‘It clearly caused great distress to the young woman concerned, and because you showed no remorse and did not admit it she had to come to court to tell me about it. ‘You show a low risk of further harmful behaviour, and you have never done anything like this before.’ The boy, who is not in school and spends his days cycling around the streets with friends, smirked as he left court with his parents, who were ordered to undergo childcare training. The youngster committed the assault in the early afternoon of June 26 this year in Wycombe Road, Tottenham, north London, after approaching the victim and saying ‘hello’. Prosecutor Lorna Ewen said: ‘He then, with his right hand, moved towards her and grabbed her between the thighs before cycling off. ‘The victim called the police and she pointed him out to them as the person who assaulted her. ‘He dropped his bike and was chased by the police. When later interviewed, he admitted being present but denied any sexual assault.’ The boy, who lives in Manor Park, east London, was given a nine-month youth rehabilitation order with a supervision requirement and told to attend a programme with the youth offending team for six months focusing on sexually harmful behaviour. His parents were told to complete a six-month parenting course and encouraged to get their son into education.","Boy forced his hands between woman's thighs before fleeing on bicycle .

Renowned English painter John Constable got his right-hand man to ‘copy and paste’ outlines for his masterpieces, research suggests. A picture by the famous landscape painter of figures and horse-drawn wagons on Hampstead Heath matches the composition for the right-hand foreground of two seminal works of Branch Hill Pond, Hampstead, painted in 1824. At the time, Constable was at the height of his fame, winning the gold medal at the Paris Salon for The Haywain and View on the Stour near Dedham that year. This picture of figures and horse-drawn wagons on Hampstead Heath matches the composition of two seminal works of Branch Hill Pond, Hampstead . Auctioneers Bonhams say the painting was worked up from a pencil drawing by Dunthorne . He was receiving a rising number of commissions from Parisian dealers and English patrons, and was asked to create two almost identical paintings of Branch Hill Pond. Under increasing pressure, Constable used his assistant Johnny Dunthorne to trace the figures’ outlines onto the larger canvas. Auctioneers Bonhams, who made the discovery, say the painting was worked up from a pencil drawing made on-site - intended to be the foreground focus of Branch Hill Pond. Artist: A woman displays John Dunthorne's self portrait. He and Constable were good friends as well as colleagues . The outline of the closer horse, cart and figures are incised - implying they were probably traced by Dunthorne - while the paint was still wet and then transposed into the right-hand corners of the canvases he had prepared. With the outlines in place, Constable would be able to work up the main body of the painting, building up the detail until he was satisfied with the finished masterpiece. John Constable was an English Romantic painter from Suffolk. He is knowbn his landscape paintings of Dedham Vale, now known as 'Constable Country' The painting, which is 25cm wide, is replicated exactly in the bottom right-hand third of the two 75cm wide canvases of Branch Hill Pond. It will go under the hammer at Bonham’s Old Masters sale on December 5, and is expected to fetch between £60,000 to £80,000. The New Bond Street auctioneers say the painting, most likely created in 1824, has surfaced for sale after 62 years in private hands. Dave Dallas, International Director of Old Master paintings, said: 'Constable is an extraordinary painter who continues to provoke debate among specialists across the world. 'Scholars are still unravelling his working methods and the extent to which Dunthorne was used in the studio. 'The incised marks on the study confirm what was long suspected, that Dunthorne traced key elements by Constable for use in major works. This new insight is an exciting discovery. 'The study reputedly comes from the artist’s studio and was then passed down to one of his granddaughters. Added to this is the fact that it hasn’t been seen on the market for so long, making this a truly unusual find.'","Renowned artist used trusted right hand man to 'trace' earlier composition .

Police now have a picture of the man . they believe killed three storekeepers in Brooklyn, and are calling for . the public’s help in catching the mystery man they call ‘John Doe Duffle . Bag’. The man in question is balding with a dark mustache and was seen walking near the scene of the most recent murder in Flatbush. Three store owners have been killed in . their shops over the past four months and the killings are connected as . all three were shot with the same .22 caliber handgun. Ballistics tests matched in each killing, all of which occurred in Brooklyn shops with an '8' in the address. John Doe Duffle Bag: The balding man with a mustache was seen twice in Flatbush minutes before and after the third shop keeper was killed on Friday . The latest suspect, ‘John Doe Duffle Bag’, was caught on surveillance footage a block and a half away from the Flatbush store where Rahmatollah Vahidipour was killed on Friday evening. Minutes later, the same moustachioed-man is seen in a different video two blocks away from the store. Murdered: Vahidipour Rahmatollah was killed with three gunshots, but it seems nothing was stolen . The New York Post reports that a different surveillance camera, located by the scene of the second murder in Bensonhurst also shows the same man. The video is of poorer quality, but they feel confident that the same duffle bag-toting man was in the area around the time that shopkeeper Isaac Kadare was killed on August 2. ‘”John Doe Duffle Bag” wore a long overcoat and carried a duffel bag,’ police commissioner Ray Kelly said. ‘He was seen in the vicinity of Vahidipour’s store just after 6 p.m. The shop owner’s body was found at 7.11pm.’ This is not the first person-of-interest in the case, and a number have since been ruled out. Previously unidentified suspects, dubbed ‘Jane Doe Green Jacket’ and ‘John Doe Bubble Jacket’, were on the police’s watch list since they were seen in the area of Vahidipour’s shop at the time of the murder. They have since been eliminated from the suspect pool as it turns out that ‘Green Jacket’ stole a bottle of perfume from street vendor ‘Bubble Jacket’ who was chasing after her following the theft. Two remaining possibilities are ‘Jane Doe Long Coat’, a woman who was seen near the crime scene wearing sunglasses and a scarf. Looking for the man: He appeared near at least two of the three crime scenes over the past four months . Near the scene: None of the stores where the shootings took place had video cameras inside . There also was a police sketch released following the first murder that took place earlier in the summer at a 99 cent store that left Mohammed Gebeli dead on July 6. That possible suspect was a man with . dark skin and wearing sunglasses, who witnesses described as being . ‘disturbed’ and talking to himself about putting a bullet in someone’s . head. That man is said to be roughly 5-foot-5 and around 140 pounds. The Daily News reports that the shop owner Vahidipour of Great Neck was behind the counter of She She in Brooklyn's . Flatbush section when he was shot Friday night. The gunman . dragged the victim's body toward the back of the store and covered it . with clothing. Victims: Isaac Kadare and Mohammed Gebeli were killed by the same handgun earlier this year . Police found the 78-year-old with two gunshot wounds to the head and one to the torso, DNA Info reported. On . the floor of the shop were the killer's calling card: shell casings . matching casings left at the scenes of the last two homicides. 'Now it's like he's telling us, 'It's me again,'' a police source told the New York Daily News. casings that police have matched to two other murders. “Now it’s like he’s telling us, ‘It’s me again,’ ” a police source said. The way Rahmatollah's body was hidden was also consistent with the previous shootings. On July 6, Mohammed Gebeli, 65, was found shot through the neck in his Bay Ridge clothing shop. His body was also hidden. Police believe the methodical killer does this to buy himself more getaway time by delaying the discovery of the bodies. 'I hope they catch the son of a b****,' Gebeli's son, Mourad said. When Rahmoatollah didn't come home at the usual time Friday his family called the police, who discovered his body. It wasn't not clear if the killer actually took anything, or if the murder was his sole motivation. 'He never had in his whole life one enemy, he didn't have, he was a very . kind man,' his sobbing wife, Naima Rahmatollah, told reporters. Suspect: Following one homicide at a 99 cent store that used the same gun, police released this sketch of the suspect . Saturday he was supposed to be at his grandson’s Bar Mitzvah. Police believe the murderer had been . watching the store in preparation for the attack, noting that he'd . chosen a shop with no security cameras. Issac Kadare, 59, was found dead in his Bensonhurst store at 1877 . 86th St., was shot in the head and stabbed in the neck. Besides owning stores, each victim was of Middle Eastern descent, prompting suspicion the killer could be racially motivated. It appeared nothing was taken from Rahmatollah's shop but both Kadare and Gebeli had money taken from them, and it remains unclear whether robbery is a motive. Unguarded: believe the killer was attracted to the store because, as with previous crime scenes, there were no cameras . Fernando Mateo of the Bodega Association of the U.S. said they were sending copies of the police sketch to their members but were mostly concerned with those fitting the previous victim's description. 'The only members that we would be concerned about are Middle Easterners,' he said. It's also possible the killer has a fascination with numerology, as the address for each homicide includes the number 8: Kadare at 1877 86th St., Gebeli at 7718 5th Ave., and Rahmatollah at 834 Flatbush Ave. None of the stores had working surveillance cameras. Scene: Police believe the killer may have been casing the shop, as it had no security cameras to catch him in the act . Neighbors called Rahmoatollah a 'neighborhood staple.' 'He was a regular guy,' said customer Xanius Patterson. 'He never hurt nobody.' Police are offering $12,000 for any information leading to the killer's arrest and conviction.","Casings from the same .22 caliber handgun found at all three crime scenes .

Kennedy, was acquitted Tuesday of child endangerment and harassment charges stemming from a scuffle in a hospital maternity ward. Kennedy had tried in January to take his newborn son from Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco. He said he just wanted the two-day-old boy, Anthony Boru Kennedy, to get some fresh air. However, several nurses objected, saying his request would violate hospital policy. Kennedy tried to leave anyway, and two nurses claimed he hurt them as they blocked his way. Scroll down to see the scuffle . Family: Douglas Kennedy, pictured with his wife Molly and his son Daniel Boru, is the 10th of Robert Kennedy's 11 children . Confrontation: Kennedy, in the blue jacket, can be seen going for the elevator in the scuffle with one of the nurses . Mount Kisco Town Judge John Donohue, who heard the case without a jury, ruled that Kennedy broke no laws. He said testimony showed the baby was not in danger except from the nurses' actions. Kennedy's lawyer, Robert Gottlieb, said after the decision, 'Given the barrage of public attention, it took a great deal of courage from this judge and we really do appreciate it.' The hospital confrontation resulted in a series of alarms, including a 'code pink,' which is used to signal a baby's abduction. In his closing argument, Gottlieb called the alarm 'preposterous.' He said the nurses overreacted to Kennedy's request and when they realized the hospital would investigate, they 'join together, get their stories straight and pressure the district attorney's office to bring charges.' He said they'd been told that any potential lawsuit for damages would have a better chance if a criminal conviction came first. Hospital: Mr Kennedy is shown in security footage trying to take his newborn son for a walk . Violence: One of the nurses is seen on the ground after she was allegedly kicked by Kennedy at the hospital elevator . 'It's an embarrassment that two nurses would so blatantly lie,' Gottlieb said. Nurse Anna Lane testified that Kennedy twisted her arm as she tried to block him from going through a door to a stairwell. Nurse Cari Luciano said Kennedy kicked her as she reached for the baby in Kennedy's arms. Gottlieb said it was a push rather than a kick and was an instinctive reaction of a father trying to protect his baby. Kennedy also fell when that happened but kept hold of the baby. Prosecutors said his actions endangered the infant. 'We were attacked': Anna Margaret Lane, left, . and Cari Maleman Luciano, right, were involved in the alleged scuffle on January 7 at Northern Westchester Hospital in . Mount Kisco, New York .

Siblings: Robert Kennedy was shot dead in 1968, and he is seen here with seven of his 11 children in 1964, right . 'The fact that the baby was not injured is a miracle,' Assistant District Attorney Amy Puerto said. She said Kennedy 'resorted to violence instead of simply complying with a request.'

Two weeks after his Presidential ambitions sank without trace Mitt Romney is moving to California and there are certanly worse places for a former candidate to wash up. Where money meets the sea: Romney's $12million beachfront home in La Jolla, San Diego and the place where he and Ann intend to move...though they have big plans for the place. Life's a beach: Mitt and Ann Romney show no signs of missing the trappings and pressures of the presidential campaign . Romney, 65, and his wife Ann have spoken of plans to move to their home in La Jolla, San Diego - an area known locally as the place 'where money meets the sea'. The couple paid $12million cash for their Mediterranean style home in San Diego's 'jewel' four years ago. And after so many months of teetering on the fiscal cliff it is easy to see why, for Romney, a move to his La Jolla bolthole with its 61 feet of beach frontage appeals. White House of worship: San Deigo's Mormon Temple set in 7.2 acres of La Jolla dominates the skyline with its twin steeples . Though, described by one political commentator, as 'an active' man it seems unlikely that Romney will simply pull up a sun-lounger and put up his feet. The couple reportedly have plans to demolish the villa as it now stands and replace it with a sprawling home twice the size. The location also has a stong draw for the devout Mormon as La Jolla is home to the San Diego Mormon Temple. The vast twin-steepled building to which Romney is believed to have contributed financially,  covers 72,000square feet of this stretch of San Diego. Having a whale of a time: Romney enjoys Thunder Mountain on Tuesday. If he's missing politics it certainly isn't showing . Romney never was a career politician. The gladhanding and electioneering never came easy to the former Massachusetts governor. Perhaps that is why, in the days since the 2012 nominee conceded he has shown no signs of missing the trappings of the power that hoevered, so briefly, within his grasp. Pumping gas at his local station in La Jolla, Romney was happy to talk about his California plans . Stipped of the 24 hour security detail, the cavalcade of cars, the assistants, campaign managers, make-up artists and stylists Romney has relaxed with his family. Two weeks to the day since losing the . election, he visited Disneyland with his wife and grandchildren and evidently had a whale of a time. The former Republican nominee has also been . seen out with his wife catching the latest installment of the Twilight . saga in Del Mar, California. Gone is the relentlessly slicked back hair and in its place a decidedly more dishevelled look; while open neck shirts and rolled up sleeves have replaced the rigid tailoring of the campaign. Pumping gas at his local station in La Jolla Romney was happy to talk to bystanders. One, mkb95, posted on Reddit: 'Mitt Romney at my local gas station...he looks tired and washed up.' Romney chatted, 'for a good three minutes while he was filling his tank,' and among the chat he spoke of his and Ann's intended move to La Jolla.

A pregnant mother-of-two who desperately wanted a daughter jumped from a cliff-top when she discovered the twins she was carrying were boys, a coroner's court has been told. Anna Byrne, 35, a nurse from Dunboyne, County Meath, was left 'devastated' when ultrasound scans in March this year showed she would be having two more boys. In the months before her death she noticed baby girls everywhere and avoided her friends - particularly those with daughters. Tragic death: Anna Byrne, 35, was 38 weeks pregnant when she jumped from a clifftop at Howth Summit near Dublin in March . In the early hours of March 8, six days after attending a psychiatrist complaining that she was feeling low, she jumped from a cliff-top at Howth summit, Dublin, the city's Coroner's Court was told. Mrs Byrne was in the last days of her pregnancy and was due to give birth by caesarean section on March 29. Her husband Terry described the final conversation the couple had before she died. He said at the inquest into her death: 'We told each other that we loved each other and she said ""I'll see ya later"".' The coroner returned an open verdict because he could not say beyond reasonable doubt that the mother intended to take her own life. Tearful testimony: Mrs Byrne's husband, Terry, told the Coroner's Court his wife had gone out to the supermarket the previous day and not returned . Dr John Sheehan, consultant psychiatrist at the Rotunda hospital in Dublin, said he met Anna and her husband on March 2 and considered her at 'low risk' from self-harm. The heavily-pregnant Mrs Byrne had been referred into his care by a midwife after she admitted her mood was low. She had suffered from depression from her early 20s and her first pregnancy in 2004 ended in miscarriage. She went on to give birth to two little boys, Joe and Aidan. 'However, she felt part of her life was missing because she had two sons and no daughter,' Dr Sheehan said. Mrs Byrne found out 20 weeks into her third pregnancy that she was carrying boys again. She was left 'devastated' and unable to sleep for several nights. She admitted to her GP she didn't feel maternal and also felt 'overwhelmed' at the prospect of having four boys. 'She began to notice baby girls everywhere', Dr Sheehan said. Terry Byrne said his wife 'put on a front' to friends and family, but privately was 'drained'. The couple had talked about flying to Greece, where they would be allowed to select the sex of their child through assisted reproduction treatment. Dr Sheehan added that Mrs Byrne had been tearful at times during their meeting but showed no signs she was feeling suicidal. He increased her dosage of anti-depressants and prescribed anti-histamine to help her sleep. Mr Byrne spoke of his final contact with his wife the day before she died. She had been heading to the supermarket when they spoke on the phone at about 11am on March 7. Mr Byrne said: 'At the end of the call, I told her to phone anytime if there was anything. We told each other that we loved each other and she said ""I'll see ya later"".' He first became aware she was missing at 1.30pm when she failed to collect their son from Montessori School. Mr Byrne checked with the supermarket and all the local maternity hospitals, and rang her friends. Funeral procession: The hearse carrying the body of Anna Byrne at her funeral in March. The pregnant nurse was 'devastated' when she discovered the twins she was carrying were boys . He called Gardai in Dunboyne at 3.30pm and just after midnight, her car was found by a friend at Howth summit. Gardai found a 'heart-rending' farewell note in the car. A search and rescue operation followed but was called off at 3.30am and her body was recovered from the base of the cliff at 7.49am. It was established that Mrs Byrne had been dead for eight to ten hours and a post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as the multiple injuries due to a fall from a height. The master of the Rotunda Hospital, Dr Sam Coulter-Smith said that Mrs Byrne did not indicate a history of depression when she registered the pregnancy. However, this information about her mental health was available in the notes made about her previous pregnancies. Natural beauty: The cliffs at Howth Head near the Summit car park where Mrs Byrne's body was recovered . In February, Mrs Byrne was noted to be 'anxious' about her pregnancy. Speaking at the court, her father John Deeney asked why she had not been admitted to hospital for observation at this point. Dr Sheenan replied this was only done in severe cases of mental illness and there were no indications she was feeling suicidal and she had made future plans. Coroner Dr Brian Farrell said although he was not saying Mrs Byrne did not want to take her own life, the evidence did not satisfy the legal test for a verdict of suicide. Consequently, he returned an open verdict. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Anna Byrne, 35, jumped from a cliff-top at Howth Summit near Dublin .

Teachers inflated children’s marks in a  new reading test and allowed half the questions to leak on to Twitter and parenting websites, an official report revealed yesterday. Nineteen of the 40 words used in the test were divulged on web forums popular with parents and teachers and even a national radio broadcast mid-way through the week-long testing period, according to exams watchdog Ofqual. The ‘phonics reading check’ – taken for the first time this June by nearly 600,000 six-year-olds – was further compromised by ‘skewed’ and unreliable marking aimed at pushing as many pupils as  possible over the pass mark of 32 out of 40. Compromised: Key words used in a new back-to-basics reading test for six-year-olds were leaked onto Twitter and parenting websites . Nearly five times as many pupils . achieved  32 marks as gained 31, the report said, and the marks in the . test were therefore ‘significantly skewed’. Teachers were issued with the pass . mark before they administered the test and Ofqual found this knowledge . ‘strongly influenced’ marking. The Department for Education urged . teachers to ‘take professional responsibility for the accurate marking . of the test so that the right children can be helped’. The test involves checking how well . pupils use the traditional ‘phonics’ method of reading, where children . learn the letter sounds of English and how to blend them. As well as reading 20 real words, . youngsters are expected to say 20 made-up words, such as ‘pib’, ‘queep’ and ‘groiks’. The test was introduced by the Coalition in an attempt to . identify pupils at risk of falling behind in reading at an early stage . so they could be given extra support. The test involves checking how well pupils use the traditional 'phonics' method of reading, where children learn the letter sounds of English and how to blend them (file picture) This year 40 per cent – nearly 237,000 children – fell below the pass mark. The report published by Ofqual criticised the way the test had been run. Schools are supposed to  keep the questions secret since only one version of the test  is used on each day of the testing week. But the report identified ‘a number of breaches of the check’s security in the course of the week’. ‘These included check items being . quoted in a national radio broadcast and referred to in forums and . websites  frequented by teachers and parents,’ it said. A few also . appeared on Twitter posts. ‘In all, 19 of the 40 items had appeared in a variety of open locations by the end of  the scheduled check week on 22nd June.’ Ofqual said the national testing agency had ensured the leaked words were taken  down from websites as quickly as possible. It also said it did not believe the . breaches were ‘malicious’ and said that there was ‘negligible’ likelihood of the leaks affecting children’s chances in the test. The disclosure follows claims from . Ofqual that ‘over- marking’ by teachers of coursework assignments was a . major cause of the GCSE English grading fiasco.","The test was taken for the first time this June by nearly 600,000 pupils .

A coat hanger factory worker suffered serious injuries to her neck and throat that almost resulted in her death when her hair and scarf became entangled in the chain and drive of a conveyor. Kelly Nield, 24, of Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, suffered the injuries in April 2009 at a Mainetti factory in Holywell, Flintshire, which manufactures and recycles coat hangers for supermarkets, a court heard. Miss Nield’s ponytail hair became entangled in the inadequately guarded conveyor on which she was working. She suffered  a fractured finger and the loss of her hair, which was pulled from her head. Hanger manufacturer: Kelly Nield, of Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, suffered the injuries in April 2009 at the Mainetti factory in Holywell, Flintshire, a court heard. The company's website is pictured . The factory employs 200 people at its Welsh base and admitted four charges brought by the Health and Safety Executive following what prosecutor Simon Parrington described as a ‘horrific accident’. The company failed to provide proper instruction, failed to prevent access to dangerous machinery parts and failed to provide an emergency stop button, he told Flintshire Magistrates’ Court. Agency worker Miss Nield had been provided with some training but it did not cover the dangers of working with conveyors, the court heard. She was sorting, de-labelling and packing coat hangers. Workers were said to devise their own systems to prevent blockages on the conveyor - and on her first day on the line, she tried to rectify a blockage. But as she bent down her scarf got entangled. ‘She was in a state of great distress as she tried to free herself with her left hand but to no avail,’ Mr Parrington said. ‘Her little finger was trapped, fractured and almost severed.’ Treatment: Emergency services were called and Miss Nield was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital in Chester, Cheshire, where she remained for three months and underwent a number of operations . She shouted for help and was eventually . freed when a co-worker ran to and pushed the main ‘off’ button. Her hair . had been torn from her head when she was trapped.

Emergency services were called and she was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital in Chester, Cheshire, where she remained for three months and underwent a number of operations. Her injuries included a crushed and twisted larynx, scarring of the oesophagus and trachea, scarring of the epiglottis, loss of hair, fracturing to her left little finger and other major injuries. The injuries had left her with continuing disabilities which still affected her daily life. Mr Parrington said that the risk of entrapment with conveyors and moving parts were well known and each year there were fatal and serious injury accidents. The accident was entirely foreseeable and avoidable, he added. Conveyor: She shouted for help and was eventually freed when a co-worker ran to and pushed the main 'off' button. Her hair had been torn from her head when she was trapped (file picture) ‘Miss Nield is now scarred for life,’ he said. ‘Although this incident had the potential to kill Miss Nield, serious injury rather than death resulted from the company’s breaches of regulations.’ The serious and life-changing injuries, and the potential harm to other workers, were aggravating features, he said.

But District Judge Andrew Shaw said that without hearing the mitigation, he had decided that the maximum penalty of £20,000 available in the magistrates’ court was insufficient. The company would be committed for sentence to the crown court next month, he said. Failure to adequately guard the conveyor or to provide an emergency stop had been ‘desperately serious’ breaches, the judge said. He described the consequences to the victim as ‘utterly appalling’.","Kelly Nield, of Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, suffered the injuries in April 2009 .

The Church of England’s General Synod voted this week to reject plans for women bishops despite overwhelming support in parishes and the country as a whole.

Sir Tony Baldry: The Tory MP said the Church of England had crippled its chances of resisting gay marriage . There is a growing Tory backlash against plans, revealed by the Mail yesterday, to bring forward to January a vote on the law change. Dozens of Tory MPs are expected to vote against, but the legislation is almost certain to get through thanks to Labour and Lib Dem support. Lord Tebbit said the proposal would push Conservative voters to Ukip, which received its highest-ever vote in the Corby by-election last week. ‘I will oppose it in every possible way I can,’ he added. ‘This is a guaranteed vote-loser.’ Civil partnerships, introduced in 2005, give gay couples similar legal rights to married couples. But ministers want them to be legally allowed to make marriage vows. Owen Paterson, the Conservative Environment Secretary, has indicated he will vote against. David Burrowes, Tory MP for Enfield Southgate, said: ‘It is highly premature.’ He added that it was a mistake to ‘rush into legislation’ when ministers should be focusing on getting the economy moving.

Four ministers sacked in September's reshuffle were given knighthoods by David Cameron . David Cameron has been criticised by a powerful Commons committee for giving knighthoods to ministers given the boot in this year’s reshuffle. The Prime Minister is accused of ‘politicising’ the honours system by MPs who say they were left ‘perplexed and disillusioned’ by his decision to give gongs to middle-ranking ministers told to return to the backbenches. After September’s reshuffle James Paice, Edward Garnier, Nick Harvey and Gerald Howard were all recommended by for knighthoods by Mr Cameron. Sir George Young was made a Companion of Honour after being sacked as Commons leader, but within weeks returned to government as Chief Whip. The awards sparked outrage because more senior women – including Cabinet ministers Caroline Spelman and Cheryl Gillan – were dumped from government without being offered an honour. It follows a major row in August when it emerged that a secret quota system meant three times as many civil servants could receive honours than medal winners at the London Olympics. Ministers have now agreed to release full explanations for of why honours are given to remove any suggestion of politicial interfeefence or corruption. The public citations will be trialled in the New Year’s Honours List. But today the Commons Public Administration Select criticised giving knighthoods to former ministers and accused Mr Cameron of going against earlier assurances that honours would not be made for political reasons. Committee chairman Bernard Jenkin took the unusual step of releasing a letter he sent to Mr Cameron warning the knighthoods for ex-ministers appeared ‘inconsistent’ with evidence given to the committee by the head of the Civil Service, Sir Bob Kerslake, during its inquiry into the honours system. Going, going, gong: Knighthoods were given to Edward Garnier, former Solicitor General, and Jim Paice, former farming minister . Lib Dem Nick Harvey and Tory Gerald Howarth were both knighted after leaving the Ministry of Defence . Mr Jenkin, a senior Tory MP, wrote: ‘If it is the policy of the Government that the Prime Minister should retain the right to award honours at his personal behest, why was this not apparent from the Government's submissions to our inquiry? ‘The honours you have announced may well reward “exceptional service”, but there is a danger that they will appear to the public to be political 'consolation prizes' for the ministers concerned.’ Sir George Young left the government in the reshuffle and was awarded the Companion of Honour - but within weeks he was back as Chief Whip . The committee’s report, published today, said the PM had to explain himself if he intended to take political control of the honours system. ‘Without questioning the public service of those selected, by the Prime Minister, to receive honours at the end of their ministerial career, we are concerned that awarding honours in such a manner will further reduce public confidence in the honours system. ‘Again, if the Government supports such political control of the award of honours in certain circumstances, it should be prepared to justify that.’ The committee warned that the credibility of the Parliamentary and Political Service Honours Committee was also in danger of being undermined by the decision to include the chief whips of the three main political parties. It said that their presence left it open to the charge of ‘political manipulation in the interest of party leaders’. Mr Jenkin added: ‘If honours are to retain any meaning and value they must be awarded to genuinely deserving recipients who have contributed to their communities above and beyond the norm, through a transparent system where people can see the value of the honour and what it was awarded for.’ In his reply Mr Cameron insisted that he had only made a ‘very limited number’ of awards, adding: ‘I am determined that these special cases will not affect the integrity of the wider honours system.’","Commons committee accuses David Cameron of politicising the honours system .

Following the horrific crash, Cole was seen looking at his mobile . phone with glasses and a magnifying glass. At Chelmsford Crown Court yesterday, Judge Anthony Goldstaub QC jailed Cole for 18 months. Sent down: Partially sighted pensioner Peter Cole was jailed at Chelmsford Crown Court (pictured) for killing a pedestrian in a crash after he lied about his eyesight to keep his driving licence . He told him: 'You were visually handicapped and its clear you should not have been driving but took the risk.' Mr Skingle suffered a broken back in the accident on January 17 and died at Princess Alexandra Hospital, Harlow, less than a month later. Prosecutor, Richard Stevens, said that, although it played no part in the crash, Cole also drove with a concrete block in the driver’s footwell to help him control the pedals. He said: 'Mr Skingle was crossing the road after going shopping in Tesco’s having looked both ways before setting off and before crossing the middle white line. 'Cole was driving at not less than 25mph and he braked before there was a collision at a speed of 8.5mph. His reaction time was 1.5 to 5 seconds.

However, Mr Brown added that if Cole had reacted two tenths of a second earlier the accident would have been avoided. He said that Cole had declined an operation for cataracts after receiving a 'negative assessment of success' but has since successfully undergone surgery for them after receiving 'different advice'.

A daredevil grandmother, who lives with Parkinson’s disease, has been performing extreme stunts, raising £10,000 for charity. Sue Brown, 68, from Stanton by Dale in Derbyshire, has been strapped to a rocket and fired across a canyon in New Zealand, gone bungee jumping, skydiving and wing walking all since the age of 55. An adrenalin-junkie, Ms Brown wanted to prove that Parkinson’s is no barrier to living a full life, raising money for Parkinson’s UK as she has travelled around the world performing jaw-dropping stunts. Jaw-dropping: Grandmother Sue Brown, 68, pictured wing walking at the International Air Show at RAF Waddington in 2003, has been performing extreme stunts to raise money for Parkinson's disease charities, a condition she lives with . The grandmother of four said: ‘I was devastated when I was diagnosed with Parkinson's but was determined that it was not going to get to me. Then I joined the local branch of Parkinson's UK. 'I met lots of younger people with it and I thought how terrible it must be for them, with mortgages and all the rest to deal with, particularly when it comes on so quickly. ‘I realised that I needed to do things to show them that, if I can do them, so can they.’ After her Parkinson’s diagnosis more than 20 years ago, Ms Brown decided to climb Mount Everest in 2002. She said: ‘I'd always wanted to climb Mount Everest so that was the first thing I decided to do and it just went from there.’ Over the years she has done several stunts including skydiving, bungee jumping and flying in a high speed plane. Her favourite stunt is ‘wing walking’ which she performed at the International Air Show at RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire in 2003. She was tied to the roof of a 1940s Bowing Stearman and flown 1,000ft over the Lincolnshire countryside. Adrenalin rush: Ms Brown did a skydive in Australia in 2004 as part of her efforts to raise money for charity along with several other extreme stunts . Supergran: Ms Brown shows off photographs of her extreme stunts in a bid to prove that Parkinson's is no barrier to living a full life . Devastating diagnosis: Ms Brown, on board a high speed plane on wire in New Zealand in 2008, was shattered to learn she had Parkinson's but said she was 'determined that it was not going to get to me' She said: ‘Wing walking is absolutely fantastic. I was in the air for about half-an-hour. ‘Because I can't walk very well, standing there and daring myself to do it was a great idea.’ Last year she went swimming with sharks in South Africa. Ms Brown said: ‘I got into this cage where we had buckets of blood and gore to attract the sharks. It was really exciting.’ She is yet to plan her next extreme stunt, working on a much safer project for now – raising money for her exercise group for people living with Parkinson’s at Noble Independent Living Centre in Long Eaton, Derbyshire. Worth the whip lash: Ms Brown bungee jumping in Queenstown, New Zealand in 2008, has been an inspiration to all she meets . Oliver Scott from the centre said: ‘Sue is an inspiration to all who meet her. ‘She is particularly keen to show younger people who suffer an early onset of disability that it is possible to carry on with a normal life.’ Millions of people worldwide, including high-profile figures such as Michael J Fox, live with Parkinson's disease which affects the way the brain co-ordinates body movements, including walking, talking and writing. Parkinson's affects around 120,000 people in the UK and is named after Dr James Parkinson, who first identified it in 1817. It affects men and women, although men are statistically slightly more likely to develop it than women, with symptoms usually appearing in people over the age of 50.","Sue Brown, 68, was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease .

Left for dead: Robert Hughes was left with brain damage after the attack in June 2008 in Malia . Four men have been found guilty in a Greek court of an attack on a former footballer who was stabbed with a broken bottle and had his head stamped on while on holiday in Crete. Former Oxford United player Robert Hughes, from Croydon, south London, was left with brain damage after the attack in June 2008 in Malia. Curtis Taylor, Sean Branton, Daniel Bell and Joe Bruckland, all from Surrey - were convicted of causing grievous bodily harm yesterday and sentenced to four years, suspended pending an appeal. Lawyer Georgios Pyromallis, who represented Taylor, Branton and Bell, said that the term is likely to be converted to a fine. He said: 'We lodged the appeal right after the verdict and either today or tomorrow they will return to the UK. 'They are relieved that they can come back. Of course my view, and I think I express their views too, is that the court didn't really have any evidence to prove that Robert Hughes, the victim, was hit or even touched by any of my clients. 'There was no witness to certify that, there was nothing. 'So I hope that in the appeal we will manage to sort this out, to clear them. It is difficult when the court have in front of them a severely injured person like Robert Hughes.' The appeal process normally takes around a year to complete. Mr Pyromallis added: 'I have . explained to them from the beginning that the charges are serious and . they could have faced being in prison for five to ten years. Justice: Mr Hughes with friends and family at Heraklion Court. He was left in a coma and had to undergo three life-saving brain operations after the attack . 'With . this sentence, it can only be reduced in the appeal court or stay the . same, and the good thing is that they will not have to serve any time in . Greek prison. It will either be reduced and suspended forever, or . converted to a fine. 'It will most probably be converted to a fine, the court has shown no interest in putting these boys in prison.' Two other men - George Hollands, from Reigate, Surrey, and Benjamin Herdman, from Worth, West Sussex, were both cleared. On trial: Curtis Taylor (front left) and Daniel Bell (centre left and Sean Branton (top left), the defendants accused of beating up Robert Hughes at Heraklion Court, Crete, Greece . Five of the six defendants with the exception of Bruckland), lost a legal bid to avoid extradition to Greece in August 2010, after taking their case to the European Court of Human Rights. They had claimed that they would face 'inhuman and degrading' prison conditions if they were sent back to the country. Mr Hughes was left in a coma and had to undergo three life-saving brain operations after the attack. Popular: Malia in Crete is a popular destination for young tourists because of the night life . His mother Margaret told the Croydon Advertiser: 'We've come over here and got the verdict we wanted to get. 'It wasn't about (them spending) 50 years in a prison. It was about getting that guilty verdict, that meant everything to me. 'As far as I'm concerned, it's over. This part of our life is over. I'm never going to get the son back that I had before. I can't get the old Robert back. 'But I don't carry the burden around with me. These boys will have to carry the burden, but I hope with that burden they will turn their lives around.'","Robert Hughes, 31, from Croydon, was left in a coma after the assault while he was on holiday in Crete in 2008 .

William Peto, 90, outside Exeter Crown Court after receiving his lifetime ban from driving . A 90-year-old driver has been told he must never drive again after a pedestrian lost part of her leg when his car mounted a pavement and mowed her down. Wealthy pensioner William Peto was trying to make a U-turn in the centre of a market town when his built up shoe jammed between the accelerator and brake and his car shot along the pavement at more than 20 mph. He hit 24-year-year-old shopper Laura Reddy who suffered horrific injuries and needed emergency surgery to amputate the bottom of one leg. Her older sister Nadine Marchant leapt to safety with less serious injuries and then used her belt as a tourniquet to save Laura's life by staunching the bleeding from her leg. Peto, of Lapford, Devon, admitted careless driving and was fined £2,500 with £100 costs and disqualified from driving for two years by Judge Erik Salomonsen at Exeter Crown Court. The judge invoked rarely used powers under the Road Traffic Act to extend the ban indefinitely on the grounds that Peto's age and infirmity render him a danger to the public. The Judge told him: 'This accident had the most dreadful consequences. 'It was mundane in that you were performing a perfectly normal procedure but your foot seems to have got caught on the pedal and you hit the kerb and went out of control. 'The circumstances may be mundane but the consequences were catastrophic. 'You collided with two pedestrians on the pavement and both suffered significant injuries. Miss Reddy suffered the most dreadful injuries which will impact upon her for the rest of her life. 'So far as she and her sister are concerned, I have read their victim impact statements and nobody could fail to be moved by the suffering the accident has visited upon them. 'Nothing can compensate them for those injuries and it is not what this court has to deal with today in financial or other terms. It is impossible to do justice to the injuries. 'All I can do is deliver a penalty for the manner of the driving and this court's powers of punishment are limited to a fine and a discretionary disqualification. 'I am told these events have affected you emotionally as well. You are a man of good character and I have no doubt you would not have wished what occurred. 'It is clear to me you must never drive again. The nature of your health means you may be a danger to the public if you do.' After finishing his sentencing the Judge asked Peto if he had understood what he had said. He replied: 'Very little of it, I'm afraid.' The judge told him his lawyer would explain. Mr Richard Crabb, prosecuting, said the crash happened at the junction of South Street and Southleigh Street in South Molton, Devon, at 3.45 pm on November 11 last year. Peto's automatic Smart car was making a u-turn when he hit the kerb and lost control, riding along the pavement at 20 to 25 mph and hitting the sisters before careering into a telegraph pole. He said: 'The two sisters suddenly became aware of a vehicle approaching them which seemed to be accelerating. They did not have time to move and it took less than a second for it to travel down the pavement and hit them. 'Mrs Marchant was thrown onto the road and suffered minor injuries but Miss Reddy bore the brunt of the impact and was knocked to the ground. 'Catastrophic': Judge Erik Salomonsen at Exeter Crown Court said Mr Peto would be a 'danger to the public' if allowed to keep driving . 'She described being in extreme pain and seeing her lower right leg bone protruding through her boot. She was bleeding profusely and her sister had the presence of mind to apply her belt around the thigh to stop the bleeding.' Laura was taken to two hospitals locally before being moved to a specialist unit at Frenchay in Bristol where the lower part of her leg was amputated. She has had five operations and skin grafts and now suffers from the shortening of one leg. The sisters both made impact statements. Laura said: 'This has been a life changing experience. Not only have I suffered horrific injuries but I and my family have suffered mental torture.' Her sister has needed treatment for post traumatic stress disorder. Mr Lee Bremridge, defending, said Peto was so shocked by the accident he has voluntarily surrendered his licence and has no intention of applying for it again. He said: 'What happened was a dreadful accident. He tried to make a u-turn but his foot got caught between the accelerator and the brake and the car launched itself across the road.'","24-year-year-old shopper Laura Reddy suffered horrific injuries and needed emergency surgery to amputate the .

A schoolboy is scarred for life after his foot slipped into an uncovered drain in the playground filled with toxic chemicals. Fabio Smith, nine, lost the skin off his left foot and his family feared doctors would have to amputate because his flesh was so badly damaged. His horrified mother has hit out after being told the drain was full of strong chemical stripper used to take paint off a nearby fence. 'Like a piece of raw meat': Fabio Smith's foot was badly injured when his leg went into a drain filled with toxic chemicals at his school . Painful: Fabio with his mother Nikita at their home in Llanishen, Cardiff, South Wales, after the incident at primary school . Nikita Payne said Fabio's foot looked like 'raw meat' after he stepped in to the uncovered drain during playtime at his primary school. School staff only told him to rinse his foot in cold water - and he continued wearing his chemical-soaked shoe and sock for the rest of the day. He was taken to hospital by his worried mum Nikita, 25, the next day when the skin on his left foot turned black and started to bubble up. Fabio was transferred to a special burns unit where doctors diagnosed toxic chemical burns. An investigation was under way at Rhiwbina Primary School in Cardiff and samples have been taken from the drain. Shocking: This was the drain filled with toxic stripper that gave nine-year-old Fabio such horrifying burns . Care assistant Nikita said: 'He was so frightened and he asked me if they would have to cut his foot off. 'You don't expect this to happen in a playground of all places. You expect your kid to be safe in school.' His mum said it is believed chemicals had been used to strip a neighbouring fence- and it may have run into the drain. Fears: Fabio will be scarred for life and his mum was worried the foot might have to be amputated . The drain was covered with leaves when young Fabio stepped in to it accidentally. 'His foot looks terrible, the skin was just bubbled completely and it was black,' Nikita said. 'It's absolutely horrendous, you can't imagine what it looks like. It's like a piece of raw meat. 'Fabio started crying at the shock of seeing his foot and I was in tears because it looked so severe. 'He was really scared of the doctors touching it because it hurt anyway and they had to peel the skin away from his foot which was really painful. 'He's going to be permanently scarred and I'm also worried about what psychological scars he'll be left with after seeing the hospital peel off his skin. 'I can't help him with the pain and I can't take the memories away.' Fabio is on crutches and doctors say it will be take two months before he can walk on it again. But he may need more surgery and has been told he will never be able to expose the skin to strong sunlight. Fabio said: 'It felt a bit soggy when I stepped in the drain. 'I was a bit scared when it turned black and it hurt most when they removed the skin. 'I hope that the skin's going to grow back.' A Cardiff council spokeswoman said the incident was being investigated. She said: 'The council and the school are working together to investigate an alleged incident which took place in the playground.'","Fabio Smith will be scarred for life after the incident in Cardiff .

The beautiful Caribbean property executive who lost more than £600,000 to a British conman will launch a crusade to alert other women to the ‘red flags of love fraud’. Nina Siegenthaler, 37, who works for Sotheby’s International Realty in the Turks and Caicos Islands, told The Mail on Sunday last night that she was stunned to learn that Alistair Stewart was an ex-convict suffering from a mental disorder that allegedly makes him unable to tell right from wrong. Posing as a hedge fund tycoon, Stewart, a Cambridge University dropout, convinced the petite blonde mother of one to hand over her savings, claiming that she was the love of his life and he would manage her money for her. High flyer: Nina Siegenthaler now works seven days a week to try to restore her savings after she lost more than £600,000 to a British conman . In fact, the 53-year-old was living on benefits in a Sussex housing association bedsit after serving a jail sentence for offences which included running up debts of £75,000 on a stolen credit card. And Ms Siegenthaler was just his latest victim. When he pleaded guilty last week to defrauding her, it emerged he had committed a string of other acts of deception. He fleeced an elderly widow out of her savings, and a pilot, a yacht broker, an interior designer and a yacht captain and his wife were other victims of his cruel scams. ‘I now know that I was dating a sociopath,’ said Ms Siegenthaler, in an interview at her office in the Turks and Caicos, where Stewart struck up an online romance after expressing interest in buying a £9 million villa. ‘It’s 18 months since it happened but it’s still all very raw for me.’ Conman: Stewart's own lawyer says he is a pathological liar . Stewart visited Ms Siegenthaler on the island – where she settled in 2002 – and persuaded her to visit England. His lavish holiday was financed by the money he purportedly was investing for her. The Harvard-educated businesswoman, who is a leading expert on Caribbean property, reported him to police when she realised there was  no return on her investment. ‘I felt I never wanted to even think about him again,’ she said. ‘But he had to be stopped before there were more victims. The trial has brought it all back to me. I feel physically ill. ‘But I am committed to using my experience to try to help other women realise the dangers that are out there. ‘There are other cases that are uncannily similar.’ Ms Siegenthaler, who has a three-year-old daughter, was apparently  targeted by Stewart because of her high profile. She is frequently quoted by Wall Street and other business journals about property investment. Police say Stewart ‘groomed’ her after researching the lifestyles of her superrich clients. He even memorised details of the types of private jets they used to travel to the islands. She says he also ruthlessly played on her emotions. When she confided to him that her father died in an avalanche, he told her he had lost his wife in a skiing accident. He even claimed to have lived in the Swiss village where she went to an elite boarding school. She finally entrusted him with her savings in September 2010. ‘He took the lot and spent it,’ said Detective Sergeant Mick Richards, who investigated the case. Island life: Stewart's victim, Nina Siegenthaler, worked for Sotheby's in the Turks and Caicos. He claimed that she was the love of his life and that he would manage her money for her . Reality: Stewart was living on benefits in a Sussex housing association bedsit (pictured) By January 2011, most of the money was gone. Pale from exhaustion, Ms Siegenthaler now works seven days a week, trying to restore her finances. Stewart has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and his own lawyer calls him a ‘pathological liar’. Ms Siegenthaler said: ‘There were warning signs that I was dating a love cheat. I just didn’t know what they were.’ She is composing a list of the ‘top ten’ signs that a suitor is a sociopath. She hopes to issue it after Stewart is sentenced at the Old Bailey on December 19.","Nina Sigenthaler, 37, learned Alistair Stewart was a mentally ill ex-convict .

An Algerian-born career criminal suspected of a ‘marriage of convenience’ to a British citizen has been deported from Spain to the UK. Police said Lazhari Zemouche had been arrested 92 times in Spain over the past 25 years for crimes from theft to robbery and had used a number of fake identities. But because he had married in the UK before his latest crime spree in Spain, he was deported to London rather than to his native Algeria. Powerless: Border agency staff are unable to stop Algerian criminal Lazhari Zemouche from entering the UK . Officials said he was put on a plane to London after his latest arrest in Majorca because he was deemed a ‘security risk’ in Spain. Spanish police sources claimed Zemouche, whose whereabouts were unknown last night, had entered into a sham marriage to obtain a British passport. They admitted that unless Zemouche was a wanted man in Britain, he would be free to roam the streets and carry on offending as he has done over the past two and a half decades in Spain. His wife’s identity and the exact date of his marriage, said to have taken place in England ‘a few years ago’, were not revealed by the Spanish authorities. He was deported to the UK under a 2007 Spanish law allowing it to expel EU citizens for security reasons. A spokesman for police in Majorca, where 45-year-old Zemouche was arrested on October 4 and held in an immigration centre pending deportation, declined to name him officially. But Zemouche’s initials appeared in the local media and informed sources confirmed his full identity.The police spokesman said: ‘He was deported to Britain because he married a British citizen in the UK and has British nationality. ‘Police records show he has been arrested 92 times since 1987 in different parts of Spain for crimes including theft and robbery and has been in prison several times. He has also used up to 22 identities. If this gentleman has put on his British passport form that he’s not got a criminal record outside of the UK then he would appear to be lying because his spells in prison date back a number of years.’ A police source added: ‘We suspect he entered into a sham marriage to obtain a British passport because after marrying he’s returned to Spain and continued offending and in principle doesn’t appear to have had any contact in Spain with his wife. For us it’s a marriage of convenience.’ Last night there was no answer at an address in North London where Zemouche is thought to have lived previously. Spanish police declined to offer a full list of his past offences. An official admitted: ‘Unless he is wanted in Britain then he will obviously be free to walk the streets a free man until such time as he reoffends. ‘But with his history, it’s a question of when and not if he’s going to reoffend.’ The Home Office said it could not discuss individual cases. Before he was granted British citizenship, background checks were carried out on Zemouche. These would have included establishing whether he had committed any offences in the UK. Figures last year showed EU migrants were committing over 500 crimes a week in Britain, but officials were powerless to deport most of them. Whitehall’s interpretation of EU freedom of movement rules means only offenders who have received a jail term of at least two years can be deported.","Lazhari Zemouche .

At 5.55pm on Thursday evening, Rafael Benitez breezed into the Bobby Tambling suite at Stamford Bridge and was ready for anything. He had to be. This, after all, is Chelsea FC. The European champions’ new manager was fully-briefed. On Chelsea’s chaotic regime, the hostile reception from supporters and the Mark Clattenburg affair. He batted away a question about the FA’s verdict that there was no substance to Chelsea’s allegation: ‘This is my first day and I have just arrived,’ he said. ‘I went straight to training and have only thought about the team and what I want to do. I want to concentrate on football issues if I can.’ I'm back! Rafael Benitez held his first press conference as Chelsea manager at Stamford Bridge on Thursday . Remember me? Benitez takes his first Chelsea training session on Thursday afternoon . Under the microscope: Chelsea fans have been given their first glimpse of the new Blues boss . VIDEO: Watch Rafa Benitez's first press conference as Chelsea boss . Chelsea stars were forced to cancel a team-bonding session after Roberto Di Matteo was fired. Morale among players was so low following the 2-1 defeat at West Bromwich they planned a night out on Wednesday at Under the Bridge, a venue beneath Stamford Bridge. It was seen as a chance for the squad to repair relations with the backroom staff following the stormy scenes at The Hawthorns when players, management and coaching staff traded insults after they fell four points behind Manchester City. Chelsea assistant manager Steve Holland had arrived at The Hawthorns with a black eye and a cut cheek and it was still prominent when he was in the dug-out at the Juventus Stadium on Tuesday night. It was a nice idea, but there are too . many other issues surrounding this club at the moment and not enough . people in power to answer them. Chairman Bruce Buck and chief . executive Ron Gourlay are happy to pipe up on radio stations when it . suits them, but when it comes to questions that are fully-loaded they . are nowhere to be seen. Shame on them. When the FA released a statement . clearing Mark Clattenburg of racially abusing their own player, John . Mikel Obi, they didn’t have the courage to face up to questions. When Benitez was asked to explain why . he is prepared to keep the seat warm for Pep Guardiola, the Spanish . coach was left to front it out himself. When the inevitable questions about . the savage decision to fire Roberto Di Matteo just six months after . leading them to Champions League glory began, it was left to Benitez. No action: Mark Clattenburg has no case to answer while John Mikel Obi (right) has been charged by the FA . Revival bid: Benitez gets to work on making Torres score goals again for the Blues . New man: Benitez arrives at their Cobham HQ before assessing his new workplace . ‘It’s like being at a Champions League . press conference,’ he joked, holding the Chelsea shirt up for cameramen . and immediately settling into his stride. It was impressive stuff, but after . finally meeting Roman Abramovich for the first time over dinner on . Thursday night, he will soon come to terms with the conditions every . Chelsea coach has to work under. Benitez added: ‘This is a massive . club, one that allows me to fight for trophies. If you see my CV, I have . all the trophies you can win at club level. I won the league twice, in . Spain. In Spain, Guardiola cannot win the Premier League — you cannot . win the PL if you are a coach in Spain. ‘The Premier League, obviously, would . be a massive trophy because I know how difficult it is to win it. If you . get an opportunity like this, you have to take it. I don’t care about . short-term. I have to win every game. New man in the hotseat: Rafa Benitez arrives at training at Chelsea's Cobham training ground and told the fans to get behind him . Reunited: Fernando Torres arrives at training at Cobham ahead of his reunion with Benitez . Leader: Captain John Terry turns up for training . ‘We have five trophies to fight for. I . will try from day one. In football and life you never know. If we win . some trophies in seven months, everybody will be delighted.’ This is a six-month trial, a chance to . prove to the rest of the world that he remains one of the best coaches . in football. That experience, along with his ability to get the best out . of Fernando Torres at Anfield, is the reason he has been appointed as . Chelsea’s interim manager on a six-month contract. Benitez said: ‘I spoke with Torres . like with the others players today, and his attitude was really good. It . seems everybody was saying he wasn’t doing well and I was saying the . same when I was watching games. ‘But his attitude was really good and . with this attitude, all the players will do well. It will be easier with . Fernando than the others. He is a top-class player and with his . attitude, he will do it. I know how good he can be, as I know how good . David Luiz or Ramires can be. He’s one of the important players in this . team, and I’ll try and improve him like I will the other players.’ That is one of the reasons he has been . appointed, to improve the form of a man who was once recognised as one . of the most feared forwards in the game. Torres hasn’t scored in the . Barclays Premier League since Oct 6, when he found the net during a . routine victory over promoted Norwich. The former Liverpool striker, who was signed by Benitez in 2007, will start against Manchester City in his first game on Sunday. This is the beginning of Chelsea’s . recovery. It has to be that way after falling four points behind City in . the Premier League and in danger of becoming the first Champions League . winners to be dumped out in the group stages. Making his point: A Chelsea fan stands outside the training ground with an anti-Benitez sign . No thanks: Chelsea fan protested when Rafa Benitez was linked in March . Benitez has made a start by appointing . former Chelsea star Boudewijn Zenden as first-team coach and has also . brought in two of his old Liverpool backroom staff, fitness coach Paco . De Miguel and  analyst Xavi Valero. Winning trophies is all important and . they can make a start in the FIFA World Club Cup next month. It will . certainly help his relationship with the supporters, particularly after . the  hostile reaction to his appointment. At Liverpool, during those infamous . Champions League clashes with Jose Mourinho, he claimed Chelsea’s . supporters were no match for  the Merseysiders. Benitez said: ‘I don’t remember the . comments, but if I said it then you have to analyse the context. We were . playing against Chelsea, a top side, in the semi-final of the Champions . League and I was defending my team. Former Blue: Boudewijn Zenden will be one of Benitez's coaches . End of the road: Roberto Di Matteo was sacked following Chelsea's defeat to Juventus . ‘If I’m a fan, I’d like to see my . manager fighting for my team, my club, and doing almost everything.

We have . something in common: I want to win every single game.’ Benitez has worked under difficult . conditions before, caught in the crossfire when Liverpool’s previous . owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks fell out. He said: ‘When I left . Liverpool I had two bosses who were not talking to each other. This will . be easier.’ After accepting a six-month contract, he couldn’t be more wrong. 2005After the game, Sheila, who was sitting right in line in the main stand, said to me that the ball had crossed the line. She is a very honest person and that was good enough for me. It was a goal.(On taking his secretary’s word that Luis Garcia’s so-called ‘ghost goal’ had crossed the line in the Champions League semi-final between the sides)To me, Arsenal played much better football two or three years ago. They won matches and were exciting to watch. Barcelona and Milan too. They create excitement so how can you say Chelsea are the best in the world?(After Chelsea’s first Premier League title win)2007Chelsea is a big club with fantastic players, every manager wants to coach a such a big team. But I would never take that job, in respect for my former team at Liverpool, no matter what. For me there is only one club in England, and that’s Liverpool. If Chelsea are naive and pure then I’m Little Red Riding Hood. We do not need to give away flags for our fans to wave — our supporters are always there with their hearts and that is all we need. It’s the passion of the fans that helps to win matches —  not flags. (The quote has been immortalised in a plaque at Liverpool’s training ground, below) I’m sure Chelsea do not like playing Liverpool. When they are talking and talking and talking before the game it means they are worried. Maybe they’re afraid? We were good friends until Liverpool started winning, then he started changing his mind. (on then Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho) YesterdayIn the past I was playing against Chelsea, a top side, in the semi-finals of the Champions League and if I am a fan I like to see my manager fight for my team, trying to win every game and doing almost everything, so I don’t see a lack of respect for Chelsea fans, it was more a manager defending his team against another top side. I am sure they will like to see me defending my club now in the way I defended Liverpool at this time. And as for Torres . I know everybody will be talking about Fernando Torres and today I was talking with him like I was talking with the other players and his attitude was good. Everybody has been talking about he was not doing well and I was the same because I was watching games and his attitude was really poor, and today it was the same as all the others.","Referee Clattenburg's race case blows up in club's face .

A toddler who was violently sick almost every hour of the day for the first 18 months of her life has finally been cured. Leah Hamid, now two, suffered from a rare digestive disorder, which stopped her from digesting her food and caused chronic sickness. She slept through the night for the first time since her birth after specialist surgeons opened up an obstruction causing the condition. Leah Hamid, now two, suffered from a rare disorder which stopped her digesting food and caused chronic sickness . Leah's condition, called duodenal stenosis, is a rare birth defect where a portion of the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) is narrowed. This prevents the stomach contents from flowing through at a normal rate. It's not known what causes the condition, although there may be a genetic link. Fortunately, surgeons at The Children’s Hospital, Sheffield, were confident that surgery would resolve the situation. And, in a lucky twist of fate, Leah would be the first child with her condition to have a procedure that left no scar. In the past, duodenal stenosis has been treated by an invasive operation which leaves scarring. But rather than making an incision to access the duodenum, surgeons decided they could access it by putting a flexible telescope down Leah's throat. She slept through the night for the first time ever after specialist surgeons opened up an obstruction causing the condition . During the three-hour procedure, they freed up the obstruction in her small intestine, leaving no scar or sign of surgery. Doctors snipped holes in the membrane covering . the first part of her small intestine connecting her stomach to her . digestive system using a balloon and electrical knife. Leah's mother Amanda, 34, said: 'She was like a different child after the operation, she recovered straight away and wasn’t sick. 'When she slept through the night for the first time ever I almost cried. My body naturally woke me up throughout the night to check on her and when I found her fast asleep it was amazing. I was so happy my baby was finally better.' Now recovered, Leah can play with her sister Alisha and brother Callum again . Mrs Hamid, who also has five other . children, Ashley 17, Adam 15, Alisha 11, Callum six and Cayden 18 . months, continued: 'We are so grateful for the help the surgeons have . given not only to Leah and me but to my husband and all our children. 'Now Leah is living a normal life we have much more time to spend as a family and I can concentrate on all my children equally.' Mr Sean Marven, consultant paediatric surgeon at Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation Trust, who performed the operation with colleague Dr Mike Thomson, said: 'I believe this procedure has never been performed on a child with this condition in the UK before due to the rare specialist skills and equipment it requires. 'I decided the it was possible as my colleague is a rare paediatric endoscopist who has the skills to perform the procedure, and because we possess the specialist equipment needed, including a double channel operating endoscope which cost £64,000, and was funded by The Children's Hospital Charity.' He added: 'The operation was a complete . success, Leah was in much less pain and had a quicker recovery. If it . had been done the regular way it would have left a big scar. We don’t . expect her to have any problems later in life.'","Leah Hamid, now two, suffered from a .

Police say a 77-year-old man who died from injuries sustained in a fall at his darkened apartment building has become the latest victim of Superstorm Sandy - raising the city's death toll related to the storm to 43. Authorities say Albert McSwain died on Saturday. He was found Oct. 31 at the bottom of the steps of his building on Rockway Beach Boulevard. The building had no power. He had injuries to his head and was paralyzed from the neck down and was taken to the hospital. Police say there have been 23 storm-related deaths on Staten Island; 11 in Queens; seven in Brooklyn, and two in Manhattan.

An unemployed father-of-12 branded 'Britain’s most badly behaved dad' was condemned by a judge today for setting a bad example to his children and making the 'lives of others miserable'. Stuart Murgatroyd, 41, was handed an Asbo to prevent him from harassing his neighbours, after a previous order banning his bad conduct expired. He was  previously arrested on suspicion of assault against the mother of his children last month - just 20 minutes before he was due to appear in court to contest his second anti social behaviour order. The hearing, where Murgatroyd was to 'vehemently deny' terrorising neighbours in two council boroughs, was later adjourned after prosecution lawyers informed JPs that Murgatroyd was in police cells. Stuart Murgatroyd, left, with his partner Dawn Hughes outside court just minutes before a hearing was about to begin and right, today, as he was given an Asbo for terrorising neighbours in two council boroughs . In their blood: Murgatroyd with children Demi, 15, Chloe, 14 and Reece, 13, who have all been given Asbos . But today as he was finally banned him from being drunk in public, he made a plea from the dock, insisting: 'I shouldn't really be getting an Asbo'. He is the fifth member of his family to have been given an Asbo. At Burnley Magistrates' Court, Murgatroyd was issued with a two-year anti social behaviour order. The . Asbo bans him from using abusive and threatening language in public, . making obscene hand gestures and being drunk or in the possession of any . open container of alcohol. Drunken Murgatroyd, who has never worked, has a long criminal record for robbing elderly people and once had to be sprayed with CS gas by police in a row over his son’s football. Council officials had kicked the family out of one of their previous homes in Burnley, Lancashire, after 125 complaints from neighbours who had endured three years of loud parties, fighting and drunken behaviour. His twin boys Reece and Dillon, aged 13, already have two-year Asbos ordering them not to cause 'harassment, alarm or distress'. Police secured interim Asbos against their big sisters Chloe and Demi, aged 14 and 15 - but both were dropped after there were no further reports against them of bad behaviour. Last month Murgatroyd tried to make a legal challenge against the application to issue him with the Asbo. But he failed when he was arrested outside the courthouse for tipping a carton of Ribena juice over his long-suffering partner. Vicious: The father-of-12 tipped a carton of Ribena juice over Miss Hughes last month . He claimed his predominantly Muslim neighbourhood singled him out and reported him to police because they disapproved of his heavy drinking. But District Judge Mr Peter Ward warned he faced jail if he stepped out of line again and retorted: 'I don’t think it is a clash of cultures, I think the problem is him being drunk. Arrested: The earlier hearing was adjourned after prosecution lawyers informed JPs that he was in police cells . 'If he is involved in disorderly behaviour that does not set a good example to the children and looking through the papers that’s what has been going on and clearly making the lives of others miserable. 'This is a dreadful category of anti-social behaviour, being drunk outside, shouting abuse and general disturbance to others makes their lives miserable. 'If you breach this order, the maximum sentence is of five years in prison. 'If there is a repeat of this sort of behaviour and you are on breach I will be looking at the sentencing guidelines for persistent breach of the Asbo. 'Do not assume that if you breach it you will only be getting a fine of £50.' The Asbo will apply in the Burnley area but will not stretch to his new address in Nelson where he and his family moved for a 'fresh start'. Murgatroyd has never worked, claiming sickness benefit for depression since he was 17. 'Britain's worst-behaved dad' has been jailed previously for mugging pensioners and stealing in a cemetery . In April 1999 he was jailed for two-and-a-half years for mugging three pensioners and stealing a handbag from a woman of 78 in a cemetery. Partner Dawn Hughes, who left their children with a babysitter so she could act as his getaway driver, was jailed for a year. In August 2004 he suffered head injuries when he was attacked by a neighbour armed with a 2ft-long machete amid claims a text message had been sent threatening to firebomb the home of the attacker’s mother. Then in 2007 Murgatroyd sparked a police siege after a row over a neighbour confiscating his children’s football. He was said to have lost his temper and hurled cutlery and a vacuum cleaner towards officers before being overpowered with CS gas. Murgatroyd had previously been issued with an Asbo but after it expired last November the couple and eight of their children moved into a £150-a-week rented three-bedroomed terrace house in Nelson hoping to make a 'fresh start'. The parents arriving at court today as Murgatroyd was condemned for setting a bad example to his children . But he was arrested again and given an interim Asbo earlier this year. Representing Burnley Council, Mr Jonathan Jackson said: 'He has shown low-level, persistent anti-social behaviour which makes life a misery for other people. 'It is his drunk and disorderly behaviour that is a problem, but not necessarily targeting specific people. 'Perhaps some of it stemming from a family of 13, this happened largely in the Burnley borough.' In mitigation, defence solicitor Mr Mark Williams said: 'On July 1st the family moved to Nelson and it has been a good three months without any issues. 'There were problems which grew over a period of time in Burnley, to a degree there was a clash of cultures. 'He had a large family living in a predominantly Pakistani area and he would drink and that would be frowned upon in the community. 'Mr Murgatroyd was more the victim. There was a confrontation with a group of males with baseball bats, maybe they are more at fault. 'There have been other incidents where drink has been involved. He wasn’t well liked in the area. They wanted to move and wanted a fresh start, it has been a fresh start. There has not been any problem in Nelson and he said he wishes never to go back to Burnley. 'There is always going to be a bit of noise when there are eight children living there. 'They have been brought up properly and their behaviour has always been good - to question him as a father is not right.'","Stuart Murgatroyd, 41, has never worked but claims sickness benefit for depression, has long criminal record for robbing elderly people .

Would-be killers were sent to shoot the girl, 15, because she has campaigned for womens' rights and educating girls in the Swat Valley area of Pakistan, which was under complete Taliban control from 2007 to 2009.

Jesse Jackson is heartbroken over his son’s troubles because there is ‘nothing worse than when you can’t fix something for your kid’, friends have revealed. The civil rights campaigner is said to be finding it ‘incredibly hard’ to watch Jesse Jackson Jr’s political career implode amid claims of marital infidelity. This week his his son handed in his resignation as a member of the House of Representatives for Illinois. Jesse Jackson Sr sees his son's career as 'family business' and watching it falter has been 'agony' for the 71-year-old . Watching that happen left Jesse Jackson ‘very, very concerned’, especially as the reason in part appears to be his battle with bipolar disorder. Feeling ‘at a loss’ will be alien to Jackson, who for decades has made it his business to interject himself into public events to exert his own will on them. But when it comes to his son, however, things seem to be beyond even his control. The problems for Jackson Jr, 47, had been mounting before his resignation and he has been investigated for alleged financial improprieties with his campaign. Prosecutors alleged he used money which had been donated to him to refurbish his home and for personal gifts, which could be a criminal offence. Then in the summer he went missing from Congress, with his office initially claiming that he was exhausted. He eventually admitted that he was suffering from bipolar II disorder and sought treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. According to the New York Times, his father, 71, regarded his son’s political career as part of the ‘family business’ and seeing him falter has been agony to watch. A close family friend said that even his attempts to control the media coverage by pulling strings behind closed doors have failed. 'Heartbroken': Jesse Jackson Sr (left) is said to be deeply upset by the personal and political troubles of his son Jesse Jackson Jr (right) The friend said: ‘That’s why this is so incredibly hard. ‘It’s always easier to deal with other peoples’ problems than your own, and he’s probably too hands-on with it. He’s very, very concerned. And there’s nothing worse than when you can’t fix something for your kid.’ Frank Watkins, an aide to Jackson Jr, added that he saw ‘confusion’ among the elder Jackson. He said that Jackson is ‘not knowing what to do relative to mental health, especially as it pertains to his own son - and kind of at a loss.’ Another strand of Jackson Jr’s problems relate to his friendship to the disgraced former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich. Jackson Jr was implicated but never charged in the scandal where Blagojevich tried to sell President Obama’s Senate seat when he became president in 2008. In his resignation letter Jackson Jr said: ‘For seventeen years I have given 100 percent of my time, energy, and life to public service. ‘However, over the past several months, as my health has deteriorated, my ability to serve the constituents of my district continued to diminish.’ Speaking to the New York Times, Alderman Sawyer, son of the late Mayor Eugene Sawyer of Chicago, said that Jackson could barely cope with seeing such events unfold. Mr Sawyer, who has known the Jackson family for many years, said: ‘For such a powerful man, for such an influential man, to not be able to control the outcome of what’s going on, I’m sure, is frustrating’.

Britain's public school leader has today hit out at top politicians for playing down the role played by fee-paying schools in helping poorer families and for 'demonising' private education. Chairman of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference has accused senior MPs of 'willful mischaracterisation' of independent schools while accusing ministers of failing to improve state education over the years. He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'The existence of incredibly successful independent schools is an irritant to many Labour politicians, a puzzle to Liberal Democrats and, it often seems, an embarrassment to the Prime Minister. Attack: Dr Christopher Ray, who has hit out at senior MPs for 'demonising' independent schools . Fee paying: Eton College near Windsor is regarded as one of the top independent schools in the UK . 'We are often damned with the faintest of praise, knowing that they cannot afford either financially or politically to dismantle us, whatever sabre-rattling they employ.' He added that despite independent schools in the UK being 'the envy of the educational world, even though we are demonised by some here at home.' Dr Ray's criticism comes at a time when the Government wants public schools to sponsor academies. But Dr Ray was also critical of academies claiming that their reliance on state funding means that they are not entirely independent. He accused former Labour schools minister Lord Adonis of a lack of understanding of the independent sector after the peer called for independent schools to become more heavily involved in the academy system. State education: Current Labour leader Ed Miliband highlighted the benefits of his comprehensive education at the Haverstock Comprehensive, pictured, in his party conference speech this year. But Dr Ray says that Labour failed to improve state education . Dr Ray, High master of Manchester Grammar School since 2004, also warned that future governments may take away some of the freedom enjoyed by existing academies. The Labour Government failed to improve standards at state schools according to Dr Ray, who says that their policy of pumping funds into the system merely created a mess. According to Dr Ray, higher grade attainment at GCSE and A Level hid the fact that British youngsters were lagging behind their peers abroad in terms of performance. A survey earlier this month found that more than half of parents would send their child to an independent school if they could afford it with privately educated students accounting for around 20 per cent of admissions to the top ten universities. Private education is also said to save the government money in terms of funding extra state education according to supporters of the system and last year the sector provided nearly 40,000 children with bursaries of around £300milion.","Dr Christopher Ray accused senior MPs of 'willful mischaracterisation' of independent schools .

The New York nanny accused of stabbing to death two children she cared for has has been indicted on murder charges today. Six-year-old Lucia Krim and her two-year-old brother, Leo, were killed on October 25 in their Upper West . Side apartment in Manhattan. Their mother Marina Krim found them in a pool of blood in the bathtub when she came home with the victims' three-year-old sister. The nanny, Yoselyn Ortega, remains hospitalized with self-inflicted stab wounds. It is unknown if the 50-year-old, who had housing and financial problems, has a lawyer. Charged: Nanny Yoselyn Ortega, pictured with Lulu Krim, right, and Nessie, left (who was not in the apartment during the attack), has been charged in their murder . Ortega is expected to be arraigned via video. A hearing has not yet been scheduled, according to court documents. It . was revealed last week that on hearing Mrs Krim's screams, the . building's super ran to the family's apartment - with his young son . trailing behind him to confront the horrific scene. As Marina cradled her surviving daughter, Nessie, the father and . son witnessed Ortega apparently attempt to inflict a fatal wound across her throat. Her . wrists had already been slit. Removal men packed up boxes of . the Krims' belongings at the home last week. Sources have suggested the family will not . return to the apartment where Lucia and Leo were . killed. Ortega, Lucia and Leo had been due to meet Mrs Krim and Nessie at a dance studio, but the mother became concerned when they failed to turn up and returned to the home. After learning from the doorman that the . nanny had not left the building, Mrs Krim frantically searched the . apartment and came across the grisly scene in the bathroom. Loss: Lulu and Leo, pictured, each had multiple stab wounds and were pronounced dead in hospital . Happier times: Marina and Kevin Krim, pictured at a 2009 event at Tavern on the Green in Central Park . Ortega's suicide bid failed and she was put in a medically-induced coma. She has now been brought out of this and charged with murder. When . questioned by police for the first time last Saturday, the nanny attempted . to paint Mrs Krim in a bad light, shifting part of the blame for the . tragedy on her. Ortega, who had told neighbors and family that she was short of money, revealed she resented her employers because they kept telling her what to . do and asked her to do the housework. 'She said . something like, ""I'm paid to watch the children, not clean up and do . housework"",' a law-enforcement source said of Ortega’s statements to . police after she woke from the coma. Father: Kevin Krim recounted the magical Manhattan childhood of his two lost children, the happy memories they accumulated before, police said, their trusted nanny murdered them .

Yoselyn became extremely animated . when she discussed the incident with police, telling officers that  she . had numerous disagreements with mother . Marina about how the kids were being cared for. Ortega waived her right to have a lawyer . present during questioning when she ominously told the detective, ''Marina knows what happened'', a source told the New York Times. Reports claimed Marina didn't think . Yoselyn was interacting with the kids enough and was giving them junk . food. The Krims were also reportedly worried . about Ortega's job performance in the weeks leading up to the killings . and had told her that if she didn't improve, they might need to replace . her. But the Krims' extended family dispute . they treated her poorly, explaining that they paid for her to travel on . holidays and even visited her family in the Dominican Republic.

The family paid tribute to the murdered youngsters at Manhattan's Avery Hall on Monday. Breaking down in tears, Kevin . Krim recalled the happy days he and his wife Marina shared with their . children and asked that the lives of . their 'best friends' be celebrated rather than mourned.

A Royal Navy task force of 3,000 troops is on standby to tackle a humanitarian crisis sparked by the mounting violence in Syria. A rapid reaction flotilla is poised in the eastern Mediterranean ready to assist civilians to escape the appalling carnage. Defence chiefs are drawing up contingency plans to evacuate UK citizens trapped in the chaos and provide emergency food, shelter and medical supplies to tens of thousands of refugees. Getting ready: A Royal Navy task force of 3,000 troops is on standby to tackle a humanitarian crisis sparked by the mounting violence in Syria. HMS Illustrious, pictured in the Med, could be used if the situation deteriorates . On standby: A rapid reaction flotilla is poised in the eastern Mediterranean ready to assist civilians escape the appalling carnage. These Royal Navy Airmen could be called into action . Officially the Response Force Task Group (RFTG) is deployed for complex naval ‘war games’ codenamed Exercise Cougar. But commanders are prepared to switch ‘immediately’ to an aid mission to avert a humanitarian tragedy as brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad continues to slaughter his own people. Nearly 40,000 have been killed and 200,000 made homeless since the tyrant began crushing a pro-democracy uprising. Prime Minister David Cameron is increasingly frustrated at the international community’s failure to halt the sickening bloodshed. General Sir David Richards, Chief of the Defence Staff, has revealed UK troops could ‘intervene’ as winter temperatures plunge and desperate refugees spill from the civil war into neighbouring Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey. The United Nations has warned four million Syrians will need emergency aid - but admits parts of the war-torn nation are no-go zones for relief workers. Preparations: HMS Illustrious is pictured in the Med as part of an exercise to test the ground attack capabilities of the new Response Force Task Group, the UK's 'Very High Readiness Maritime Force' Captain Martin Connell, commander of aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious, taking part in exercises off Vlore, Albania, said the task force was ready to spring into action. He said: ‘If there is an imperative to do some form of evacuation operation, the task group is ready to do that. That’s exactly the sort of role we could switch to immediately. ‘The very idea of the RFTG is to be at a very high level of readiness. If we were activated to go and do something today we would be able to provide a response. ‘I have the expertise of 1,000 or so sailors, Marines and soldiers on here that can allow me to do that pretty much at the drop of a hat. We have got the ability to go in and evacuate UK entitled persons to safety. ‘HMS Illustrious alone has got space to make us an ideal ship to look after evacuees for a short period. You could quite easily take 1,000 people in and take them to a place of safety. We have done it before, I envisage us being able to do it again. ‘In a matter of days the task group can be diverted towards an area where we might be required to act. It provides a real relevance to our training. Next time we are doing this it could be for real.’ Commodore Paddy McAlpine, the one-star officer commanding the whole task group, said: ‘We are ready to respond to anything.’ Set up in 2010’s Strategic Defence and Security Review, the Response Force Task Group is primed to deal with unexpected world events, ranging from war-fighting to humanitarian interventions and evacuations. It currently consists of 22,000-tonne aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious, assault and command ship HMS Bulwark, Type 23 frigate HMS Montrose and RFA Mounts Bay, a support vessel packed with stores, fuel and equipment. Hartland Point, a merchant vessel, is carrying emergency supplies. The fleet consists of 1,200 Royal Marines, supported by specialist engineers, medics and reconnaissance, and 1,800 Navy and Army personnel. More than 12 helicopters are available including Apache gunships from 656 Squadron Army Air Corp - which fought against Colonel Gaddafi - Royal Navy Merlin specialising in surveillance and Sea King transporters. Concerns: Defence chiefs are drawing up contingency plans to evacuate UK citizens trapped in the chaos and provide emergency food, shelter and medical supplies to tens of thousands of refugees . Assistance: Royal Navy commanders are prepared to switch to an aid mission to avert a humanitarian tragedy as brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad continues to slaughter his own people . The flotilla is currently focused on practising amphibious landings in ‘enemy’ territory. Troops have been rehearsing the evacuation of‘refugees’ from the shoreline of a conflict-torn country. This is significant as the coast of Syria is less than 1,000 miles away and could be reached by the RFTG in three days. Sailors pretending to be displaced citizens clustered at a naval base in a makeshift ‘safe haven’ waiting to be transferred to HMS Illustrious and HMS Bulwark by landing craft. But in a real emergency Chinook and Merlin helicopters would fly forward to pick up bedraggled British passport holders. Marines could also travel inland in protected vehicles to rescue people. Once aboard, they would be screened for nationality, have their official documents checked and given medical care, food, sanitation and bedding. The RFTG can pick up 3,000 people in a single lift and move them quickly to safety. Training: Merlin helicopters on board the HMS Illustrious are pictured during an exercise . Responsibilities: The captain of HMS Illustrious, Martin Connell, is pictured . One experienced naval officer told the Mail: ‘This is just an exercise but it is very timely. We may be called upon if the situation in Syria continues to worsen. We’re perfectly placed to go.’ Royal Navy vessels could act as transport hubs, escorting specially chartered civilian ships to distribute aid and pick up foreign nationals fleeing Syria and surrounding countries. Marines deployed with weapons are also on standby to protect ports where humanitarian supplies are unloaded. The Ministry of Defence and Foreign Office has been closely involved in contingency plans to evacuate UK passport holders. Officials fear that thousands of Britons would become trapped if instability and violence spreads from Syria. The operation would mirror the evacuation of Lebanon in 2006 when 3,500 UK passport holders were rescued. Most have since returned. Ministers are wary to avoid any move becoming the first step towards full-scale military intervention against Assad’s regime. Sending troops into Syria would be difficult without a UN Security Council resolution – so far blocked by Russia and China. But deploying to neighbouring countries is an option.","A rapid reaction flotilla is poised in the eastern Mediterranean ready to assist civilians to escape the appalling carnage .
