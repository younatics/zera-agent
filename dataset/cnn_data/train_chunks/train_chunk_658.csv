A family watched in horror as a ‘bull terrier’ mauled their Chihuahua puppy to death during one of her first walks off the lead. Elvi Richardson, 21, was devastated after her puppy Lexi was attacked by a ‘bull terrier-type’ dog in woods near her home. Her younger brother Conor, 14, and grandmother Nicky Richardson, 62, were taking Lexi for one of her first walks off the lead when she was set upon. Puppy mauled: Elvi Richardson is devastated that her puppy Lexi (pictured together) died in her arms after being savagely attacked by a 'bull terrier' Nicky Richardson told yesterday of the horrific moment when the terrier clamped its jaws on Lexi. She said: ‘It just charged from about 15 yards away and went for her. ‘It just picked her up and bit her in its mouth, I was thumping it on the head with my hand and I was just screaming saying “no, no, no”. I was just so angry, it wouldn’t let go. ‘It was horrible. It got hold of her and she was screeching, I’ve still got that picture in my mind. It has broken Elvi’s heart.’ By the time the dog finally let go, the puppy was fatally injured and died in Miss Richardson’s arms after she arrived at the park by car. 'She was screeching': The owners watched on in horror as the rogue dog fatally injured Lexi. Police are investigating the attack . Amazingly, after the incident, the owner of the black and white terrier said it was their fault as Lexi was not on a lead and refused to apologise. Police are now investigating the incident which happened on a field at Colwick Woods, Nottingham, at around 6.15pm on August 31. The RSPCA is also looking into the incident. Miss Richardson, from Bakersfield, Nottingham, said: ‘I could not believe it. It was horrible, I would not wish the whole thing on my worst enemy. ‘All I ever wanted was a little Chihuahua and then this happens. This was one of her first proper walks.’ A spokeswoman for the RSPCA said: ‘This incident must have been deeply distressing for the owner of the puppy. ‘An inspector visited the owner of the dog and gave advice to them on controlling their dog at all times and how to prevent any incident like this happening in the future. ‘At this stage we have no further information on what exactly happened so are unable to comment further.’ A Nottinghamshire Police spokeswoman said the force was investigating the attack to determine whether any crime had been committed under dangerous dog laws. She said: ‘Obviously the owner of the dog was very distressed by this incident.’ Last Saturday, a cat known as the ‘honorary mayor’ of an Alaskan town was attacked by a loose dog which left the cat called Stubbs with a punctured lung, bruised hips, a long deep gash on his side and a sternum fractured to the point it might need to be repaired with a plate. A walk in the woods: Elvi's grandmother Nicky Richardson (pictured) was taking Lexi on one of her first walks off the lead in Colwick Woods when the attack occurred . Stubbs underwent three hours of surgery after the attack and his treatment has cost US$2,000. In August a 37-year-old woman from Doncaster, South Yorkshire needed 72 stitches in her face after a neighbour's dog attacked her. Colleen Hutchinson admitted she was lucky to be alive after the Staffordshire bull terrier clamped its jaws around her face in the Wheatley area. She is now looking at taking legal action against the owners of the dog, Leyland, which was put down after the incident. Dangerous dog?

The Information Commissioner Christopher Graham will come under huge pressure from MPs today to release the list . The Information Commissioner will come under huge pressure from MPs today to allow the release of an explosive list of blue-chip companies who hired corrupt private detectives. Christopher Graham is demanding the Home Affairs select committee withhold the list while he conducts a criminal investigation over potential breaches of data protection laws. But the committee gave the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) an ultimatum to publish the list or the MPs would do so. Their deadline passed last night without Soca taking any action. MPs on the committee were ready to publish the dossier, but have delayed after objections from police and Mr Graham, who will appear before MPs this afternoon after he was summoned late on Sunday night by committee chairman Keith Vaz. They will want to probe his claim that they could scupper the investigation by publishing the list of 98 names compiled by the Serious Organised Crime Agency. The number had been thought to be 102 but when Soca handed the list to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), several names were withheld which are the subject of a separate Metropolitan Police investigation. At least 33 names from the list have already leaked out, including that of X Factor creator Simon Cowell. Blue-chip firms also understood to feature include banking giant Credit Suisse, accountancy firm Deloitte as well as insurance company Allianz. Last week, Mr Vaz said it was in the ‘public interest’ to name the firms and individuals who have paid private detectives convicted of corrupt practices. However, Mr Graham has insisted doing so could undermine his investigation. In a blog post on Sunday he wrote: ‘It’s not clever to start a criminal investigation by publishing the names of everyone and everything you’re investigating.’ Keith Vaz (left) said last week it was in the 'public interest' to name the firms who have paid private detectives convicted of corrupt practices. At least 33 names have already leaked out including Simon Cowell (right) He said it was ‘not fair’ those on the list could learn of their inclusion from a committee of MPs. He added: ‘We have to start from the central principle of  British justice that some of the 98 may not have broken any law. 'The criminal offence associated with “unauthorised disclosure” of personal information depends on the prosecution establishing that the clients knew that the information they were seeking would be, or could only be, obtained by unlawful means. That will be central to the ICO’s investigation.’ Mr Graham’s office was belatedly handed the list by Soca at the end of August after weeks of pressure. The ICO is to write to the celebrities, law firms, banks and other companies to ask them what they knew about the activities of the investigators they were using. Mr Graham said investigators will also have to examine more than 30 files generated by Operation Millipede, the Soca probe which resulted in the jailing of four rogue investigators last year. The existence of the list emerged during an investigation by the committee. Soca, dubbed  ‘Britain’s FBI’, refused to publish it on the grounds it could breach privacy laws, and damage commercial interests. But critics claim nothing was being done about a scandal akin to newspaper phone hacking. Soca said it always intended to pass the list to the ICO once the Met investigation was over.","Christopher Graham has demanded MPs withhold list while criminal investigation into potential breaches of data protection laws takes place .

Victory: Paula Williams recently won a tribunal over false claims that led to her being fired from her job as a teaching assistant at Bridgtown Primary School . A primary school teaching assistant has won £16,000 after she was unfairly sacked for swearing and posting a picture of herself drinking from a penis straw on Facebook. Paula Williams, 45, was dismissed after a member of staff overheard her saying ‘f***’ to another teacher in the playground. The divorced mum-of-two from Hednesford in Staffordshire was also disciplined after a picture appeared on Facebook showing her drinking from a joke ‘penis straw’ at a Christmas party. She was also accused of using the phrase . ‘sexy beast’ to a child and taking a book entitled ‘I shot my daddy’ on a . swimming trip. Miss Williams, who had worked at Bridgtown Primary School in Cannock, Staffordshire, for 20 years - including nine as a volunteer - was sacked on May 3 last year. She appealed the decision and took the school to an employment tribunal claiming unfair dismissal. On Friday the tribunal in Birmingham ruled in her favour and ordered the school to pay her £16,437.79 in compensation. Speaking afterwards, Miss Williams said: 'I am glad it is all over now, it is not about the money I received, it never was about the money, it was the fact I didn’t say those things. 'I am glad a line has now been drawn under the whole thing, it affected my health and made me life very hard considering I had no income. 'The headteacher at the school has been there for around four years now, the previous one was there for 27 years, I obviously knew that one a lot better. 'I just wanted the governors to be more proactive and take responsibility for what was happening. 'I was supposed to have said the word f*** to a teacher in the playground during conversation. 'I don’t know if it was him who made the complaint but I haven’t spoken to him about it. 'The only apparent witness to me apparently swearing was another teacher, I don’t know who, who said that none of the children heard me swear, probably because I didn’t.' It was alleged that Ms Williams was swearing and behaving inappropriately, but the tribunal found in her favour . She added: 'I am just happy it is all over, so is my partner, he has had to work extra-long hours in order to keep us going and to bring the money in.' The disciplinary board which dismissed Miss Williams also accused her of posting ‘inappropriate’ pictures on Facebook. She added: 'There were three pictures in question. 'The first two were me dressed as a St Trinian’s schoolgirl for a private 40th birthday party and the third one I was tagged in. 'The third one was me at a staff Christmas party drinking from a ""penis straw"" which was given to me by another member of staff as a Secret Santa. It is ridiculous.' Bridgtown School headteacher Joanna Raybould told the tribunal Miss Williams was dismissed for swearing and posting the pictures on Facebook. Long service: Miss Williams had worked at Bridgtown Primary School in Cannock, Staffordshire, for 20 years - including nine as a volunteer . In a statement to the tribunal Mrs Raybould said Miss Williams’ behaviour had affected 'my health and confidence' and had impacted on 'the whole atmosphere at the school'. Tribunal chairman David Ansti said the school failed to give Miss Williams adequate guidelines on what language she could use at work and failed to verify the statement of alleged witness to the swearing. He also said the Facebook photo’s which were taken at a Christmas fancy dress party, were not put online by Miss Williams. County Councillor Ben Adams, cabinet member for learning and skills said: 'We are disappointed with the outcome but, nevertheless, accept the tribunal’s decision. 'We expect the highest standard of conduct by staff in our schools. 'We are awaiting more information on the outcome of the proceedings before we can comment further.'","Paula Williams, 45, denies she ever swore to another teacher .

A top Harley Street doctor has denied stealing a wallet stuffed with £2,500 cash from Starbucks, insisting he thought it was his because he often carries several at a time. Abdul Choudhuri claimed he owns at least 20 wallets and that when he heard a wallet had been handed in at a Starbucks in Nottingham, he asked staff for it back in the genuine belief it was his. After claiming the wallet, which had actually been mislaid by a traveller from Singapore and handed in to staff, the 41-year-old doctor was arrested when he returned to the scene of the alleged fraud a month later. 'Thoroughly dishonest': Prosecutors described Abdul Choudhuri as 'highly manipulative' in court after it was alleged that he dishonestly claimed a wallet with £2,500 in cash handed in at a Starbucks cafe . Dr Choudhuri, who provides cosmetic surgery and . private medical treatments through his business with clinics in . London, Nottingham, Beverly Hills and Monaco, is also accused of . attempting to pervert the course of justice after a key witness . allegedly received a phone call from either him or ‘someone acting on . his behalf’ posing as an official and claiming the trial had been . postponed. Prosecutors have described him as ‘a . thoroughly dishonest and highly manipulative individual who has gone to . extreme lengths in order to avoid conviction’. But in giving evidence in his own defence at Nottingham Crown Court, Dr Choudhuri denied he had done anything wrong. He claimed he routinely carried . several wallets - one for each of his separate medical businesses and . family matters. He told jurors that on the . day the wallet, which belonged to Singaporean tourist Kenny Quek, went . missing in October 2010, he had at least 20 with him in a ‘man bag’. Several wallets: Dr Choudhuri claimed to own at least 20 wallets and carried several at a time, so when he heard one had been handed in, which had a 1,000 dollar Singapore note (pictured), at Starbucks he asked for it back, genuinely believing it was his . He added he was ‘all fingers and . thumbs’ at the time because he was the coffee shop with his wife, Fatima . Jabbar, who is also a qualified doctor, and their five-week-old son. He said he had taken her to the . Starbucks, in Nottingham city centre, as a treat because she had endured . a difficult breech birth, and was experiencing post-natal depression. Dr Choudhuri also claimed to have . been hit by a number of recent family problems, including the death of . an uncle and his mother suffering a stroke. Asked by Jeremy Dein QC, defending, . if he had gone to the counter and dishonestly claimed the wallet, he . replied: ‘No, I did not.’ The court has heard how Mr Quek . returned to the Starbucks, in Nottingham city centre, hours after . realising he had left his wallet behind, only to be told it had been . claimed by another man. It contained £2,500 and a 1,000 dollar Singapore note worth around £500. Body Perfect Clinic: Dr Chouduri has a cosmetic surgery clinic on London's famous Harley Street (pictured), a top spot for the city's best medical practices, as well as in Beverly Hills and Monaco . Dr Choudhuri was arrested a month . later when he returned to the coffee shop and was seen acting ‘shiftily’ by barista Lisa Wright. The court heard that when police . arrived, the British-born doctor allegedly went to the toilets and did . not emerge for two minutes. Jonathan Straw, prosecuting, said . that an officer heard a series of banging noises and believed Dr . Choudhuri was trying to hide or flush something away. He added that after his arrest . minutes later, Dr Choudhuri claimed to know a superintendent with . Nottingham Police and said officers would ‘lose their jobs’. But Dr Choudhuri told the court he . was in the toilet sterilising his son’s bottle, and denied he had ever . claimed they would be fired. Jurors have heard that when he was . searched after his arrest, a 1,000 dollar Singapore note was found in a . wallet he was carrying. However, Dr Choudhuri said movie . stars and members of royal families from the Middle and Far East, . including ‘princesses with Mulberry handbags full of money’ were among . his clients and many often paid with currency from their own countries. The Body Perfect clinic which is run by Dr Choudhuri offers surgical and non-surgical cosmetic medical treatments . He said some customers preferred to . pay in cash because their faiths forbade them to use credit and that . must have been why he was carrying the Singaporean cash. Dr Choudhuri said he trained in . medicine at Liverpool University where he graduated in the top ten of . his class of 200, before completing his studies at a Cambridge teaching . hospital. He became a NHS GP in Nottingham in 2004, then turned private and opened his Harley Street clinic in 2010. He told the court his business - Body . Perfect Clinic - grew rapidly, and that he provided cosmetic surgery . and medical services to thousands of people. Dr Choudhuri, whose postmaster father . came to the UK from Hong Kong at the age of 16, said his wife worked at . his Harley Street clinic, adding: ‘All the royal princesses would . always go to her. She was always in demand.’ Jurors heard that by autumn 2010, his . tax bill alone was more than £100,000 and he often gave away thousands . of pounds to charities. Asked by his barrister if he had ever . broken the law, Dr Choudhuri replied: ‘I’ve always made it my mantra to . respect the police and stay out of trouble.’ However, the court was told that . after his arrest, he sent a text message to his wife that read: ‘If pigs . ask you anything, it is always no comment. Don’t tell them anything.’ Dr Choudhuri said he could not . explain the message but that he was not acting himself because he was . ‘bemused, shocked and scared’. He later told police in an interview: . ‘I have worked 18 to 20 hours days since I was 21. Prior to that it was . education, education, education, and you think I would throw all that . up the wall to steal a wallet?’ Dr Choudhuri is also accused of . trying to set up a false alibi, by pressuring his accountant into saying . a meeting the pair had on the day the wallet was claimed took place at . 4pm, when in fact it was 10.30am. Dr Choudhuri, of Nottingham, denies fraud and two counts of attempting to pervert the course of justice. The trial continues.

'I knew people loved Miss Saigon and had taken it to their hearts but this is beyond my wildest dreams. ‘The atmosphere down at the theatre today is full of excitement and I can’t wait to bring my new production back to the West End.’ Sir Cameron said that for a lot of people the Vietnamese War drama was the one great musical they had never seen. ‘There are several generations who have only heard about it,’ he added. The show will begin its run at the Prince Edward Theatre on May 3 – 25 years after the production first opened in the West End – and tickets are being sold up to October 25 next year.

Children are becoming obese because health visitors are worried about offending their parents, experts have warned . Children are becoming obese because health visitors are  worried about offending parents of overweight youngsters, experts have warned. Researchers said some nurses believed parents were happier to have ‘chubby’ babies. But their lack of action could create a damaging long-term ‘cycle of disadvantage’ for fat children who struggle to do enough exercise. ‘Health visitors currently lack the skills, knowledge and confidence to proactively manage obesity risk in infants,’ the authors wrote. They warned of an ‘urgent need’ for better training so healthcare professionals do more to stop heavy children becoming obese. One in ten four and five-year-olds in the UK and nearly one in five 10 and 11-year-olds were classed as obese by the NHS Information Centre in 2010. Lead author Professor Sarah Redsell, of the School of Nursing, Midwifery and Physiotherapy at the University of Nottingham, said the main risk factors can be identified ‘during infancy or even earlier’. Between a quarter and a third of babies are thought to gain weight too quickly in the first six months of life - a risk factor for obesity. But health visitors considered this a ‘sensitive issue’ which made them ‘unsure how to intervene without alienating parents’. ‘Health visitors felt they had a role in advising parents about diet but did not formally identify and/or intervene with larger infants,’ the team wrote in the journal Maternal & Child Nutrition. ‘They believed some parents preferred larger infants and were unaware that their feeding practices might be contributing to obesity risk.’ Children are more likely to be overweight if their mothers were overweight and smoked during pregnancy. Breastfeeding and late introduction of solid foods reduces the risk but Professor Redsell’s team found inconsistency in the Department of Health’s recommendation not to wean a baby until it is six-months-old. ‘Some [health visitors] endorsed this advice while others felt it was a step too far for most parents. ‘These . participants advised parents to provide “tasters” and small amounts of . solid food from around four-months onwards,’ they wrote. Health visitors' lack of action could create a damaging long-term 'cycle of disadvantage' for fat children who struggle to do enough exercise . Many health visitors were ‘uncertain’ about the importance of smoking during pregnancy and high birth weight, both known risk factors for child obesity. The experts concluded: ‘There is an urgent need for tools and training to enable all health care professionals to recognise and manage infants at risk of developing obesity without creating a sense of blame.’ Fat children may suffer from delayed motor development, which could lead to lower physical activity and create a long-term ‘cycle of disadvantage’, they warned. The study involved phone interviews of up to one hour with 20 health visitors, seven nursery nurses and three registered nurses in Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire. Rural, urban, affluent and deprived areas were all covered. The researchers contrasted the UK with . the U.S., where obesity risk factors are considered as part of every . child visit by a healthcare professional. UK . health visitors have a statutory duty to offer a public health service . to families with children under five-years-old, including advice about . health and nutrition. Breastfeeding and late introduction of solid foods reduces the risk of obesity but the team found inconsistency in the Department of Health's recommendation not to wean a baby until it is six-months-old . However, there is no national guidance on identifying infants at risk of obesity, despite the issue having been highlighted by the House of Commons Health Committee in 2004 and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in 2006. Dave Munday, professional officer at Unite and a registered health visitor, said the government’s Health Visitor Implementation Plan 2011-2015 will help ease the burden on staff, with recruitment of an extra 4,200 health visitors. ‘The hope is that with the extra resources, families will get extra support and health visitors won’t just be concentrating on crisis situations,’ he said. ‘Health visitors need to have a good relationship with families but also need to be able to have those really difficult conversations. ‘If the only message a family gets is that a health visitor thinks their child is fat, that’s not going to work. It takes skill and time to plant seeds so that a family will make decisions that are healthier for their child.’","Nottingham University study has concluded that this lack of action could create a long-term ‘cycle of disadvantage’ for obese children .

"By . Harriet Arkell . PUBLISHED: . 07:46 EST, 9 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:06 EST, 9 September 2013 . A devoted father was jailed today for trying to turn his son into a star racing driver - by staging a £600,000 tax fiddle to pay for his cars. Financial advisor Michael Jones, 60, carried out a complex tax fraud to fund his son's dream of becoming the next Lewis Hamilton. A court heard Jones had spent a fortune paying for his son Nicholas, 23, to race across Europe, running up 'enormous debts' and even remortgaging the family home for £400,000 before he embarked on the tax fiddle. Michael Jones, 60, was jailed today after admitting a tax scam designed to help his son Nicholas Jones, 23, pictured, in his dream of becoming a racing car driver . Prosecutor Roger Griffiths said: 'His son had a burning ambition to become a racing driver and he was a much-loved son who was loyally supported by his father. 'But it meant the taxpayer was funding the sporting ambition.' Jones made bogus tax claims on lucrative advertising deals which he claimed his son had landed.  He also claimed his son had been given gifts of sponsorship from a dozen businesses backing his racing dream. But Cardiff Crown Court heard that these did not exist - and Jones used his financial expertise to defraud the taxpayer of £140,625 in a scam involving £600,000. Jones, of Castleton, near Cardiff, was jailed after he admitted making false statements, transferring criminal property and evasion of VAT. Jones was sentenced to 32 months in prison after he admitted cheating HM Revenue and Customs. Nick Jones, 23, was previously cleared of acting with his father to defraud the Revenue to fund his career . Judge Patrick Curran QC said: 'Your son’s burning ambition to be a racing driver was as much yours as it was his. 'Your motive was to assist your son's career and you had financial problems as a result of trying to support him. 'You designed a fraud, employing your expertise as an accountant and you involved others in it. 'Your son was in ignorance of the criminal nature of your scheme and he was duped by his own father.' The court heard how Jones got his son interested in racing after taking him go-karting at the age of three. Nicholas started racing karts before moving onto Mini Coopers and in 2009 he won the Welsh Sports and Saloon Car Champion. Nicholas studied at Silverstone Motorsport Academy and travelled to Belgium to take part in the Renault Sport Clio Cup. His son was also taken to court charged with being part of the swindle. The aspiring racer told the court he had no idea his father was fiddling cash from the taxman to support his ambition to become a driving star, and was cleared after telling a jury: 'If I had known I would not have done it.' Michael Jones was jailed for 32 months at Cardiff Crown Court today after admitting his tax evasion scam . Michael Jones invited 12 companies, most of them local, to purchase advertising on the website and race cars of Nick Jones Racing Ltd (NJR), of which he was company secretary. The advertising did not materialise, but the participating companies falsely reclaimed the VAT.  The directors and sole traders were also personally reimbursed with a gift of 'tax-free' money. Jones profited himself by falsifying the company accounts.  He failed to show the real income of the business, and when sponsors made payments to NJR, the money was often quickly transferred to his personal bank accounts within 24 hours. As a result, he defrauded the HMRC out of £140,625. Zoe Ellerbeck from the HMRC said: 'Michael Jones operated a scheme where he directly encouraged clients of his accountancy business, J&R Business Services Ltd, to advertise with NJR in order to commit VAT fraud. 'He also deliberately misrepresented NJR’s income to pocket tax that should have been paid to HMRC.' She added: 'We are investing more resources than ever into tackling tax fraud and will not hesitate to investigate those who cheat the system and other law abiding people.'","Michael Jones, 60, lied to HMRC about profits to fund his son's racing dream .

"By . Michael Seamark and Jason Groves . PUBLISHED: . 18:21 EST, 9 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:39 EST, 9 September 2013 . Shamed ex-Cabinet minister Chris Huhne was still blaming everyone but himself yesterday for his spectacular downfall. Huhne was jailed in March for perverting the course of justice by persuading his then wife to take his speeding points on her driving licence so he would escape a ban. The eight-month sentence, of which he served only 62 days, brought his political career to a humiliating end. It followed months of lies in which he repeatedly denied the offence – only to admit his guilt on the eve of his trial. Ex-Cabinet minister Chris Huhne claimed that his downfall was 'payback' for speaking out about phone-hacking . But Huhne claimed yesterday that he was the victim of a Press vendetta and his downfall was ‘payback’ after he spoke out about phone-hacking. His attempt to blame the Press for his woes was quickly slapped down by Nick Clegg. Asked about Huhne’s ‘bizarre’ allegations, Mr Clegg – whom he challenged for the Liberal Democrat leadership – said : ‘It is his opinion. Is it exactly my opinion? No it isn’t.’ Huhne, 58, said the News Of The World targeted him to expose his affair with his aide Carina Trimingham, which resulted in the break-up of his marriage. The Sunday Times then ‘groomed’ his ex-wife Vicky Pryce, he said, until she told the newspaper about taking his speeding points. Miss Pryce, 60, was also convicted over the 2003 speeding incident on the M11 and jailed for eight months. Sentencing the couple, Mr Justice Sweeney, told them ‘any element of tragedy is entirely your own fault’. Huhne said the News Of The World targeted him to expose his affair with Carina Trimingham (pictured together) The judge told Huhne, whose attempt to avoid conviction ran up prosecution costs of more than £100,000: ‘Despite your high office you tried to lie your way out of trouble.’ Huhne has admitted he ‘lied and lied again’ but there was no mention of that in his column for yesterday’s Guardian, where he made his claims. Of the exposure of his relationship with bisexual Miss Trimingham, 46 – weeks after he had cynically portrayed himself as a happy family man during the 2010 election – he wrote: ‘My endgame began when Neville Thurlbeck, the chief reporter of the now-defunct News Of The World, heard gossip that I was having an affair. ‘Rather than cheapskating on the proposed investigation by hacking my phone, the News Of The World put me under extensive surveillance by a retired policeman, a more expensive exercise. 'Why was News International prepared to invest so much to tail an opposition Liberal Democrat back in 2009? Huhne and Vicky Pryce were both jailed for perverting the course of justice after she took his penalty points . Huhne claimed that his economist ex-wife Vicky Pryce was 'groomed' by The Sunday Times . ‘Maybe it was coincidence, but that . summer I was the only frontbencher who, with Nick Clegg’s brave backing, . called for the Metropolitan Police to reopen the voicemail-hacking . inquiry into Rupert Murdoch’s empire. The News Of The World sparked the end of . my marriage, but another Murdoch title, the Sunday Times, then groomed . my ex-wife until she told them about the speeding points. ‘The political editor bought dinners, sent flowers, offered breaks at smart hotels, and reassured her that she would not face any unpleasant consequences (such as prison). ‘Four successive weeks as the splash in the Sunday Times ensured our joint prosecution. 'The Crown Prosecution Service loves a celebrity trial. It was the end of my political career, and it locked up my ex-wife too.’ Huhne dismissed swapping the speeding points with his wife as something that ‘seemed like a minor matter’ and said an AA survey found that 300,000 motorists have done the same thing. But he did concede he was ‘not proud’ of his behaviour and said the ‘personal consequences were  monstrous for my family and me’. On Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday, Huhne acknowledged that he had made himself ‘vulnerable’ by asking his wife to take his points. But he added: ‘Sometimes newspaper groups, media groups, have their own interests as well. ‘Murdoch in particular is exceptionally powerful and over many, many years, he has played the person rather than the issue and he has also used that political influence to bulldoze a way for his business interests. ‘The way in which this was specifically done was a very clear payback.’ Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens described Huhne’s claims as ‘bizarre,’ adding: ‘The Sunday Times pursued a legitimate story of considerable public interest.’ Nick Clegg said he did not 'exactly agree' with Huhne's claims (pictured together in 2007) Mr Thurlbeck took to Twitter to hit back. He said the Huhne was not a ‘Murdoch press target’ and that it had . taken a year to persuade his editor to run the affair story. Mr Thurlbeck added: ‘The “Murdoch press” thought Huhne was such a political minnow they didn’t want to run it. End of conspiracy theory.’ Former Labour minister Kate Hoey also criticised Huhne via Twitter. ‘So Chris Huhne blames Rupert Murdoch for his downfall. I thought he lied and broke the law. Some ex-politicians never learn,’ she said. Asked whether it was fair for newspapers to expose Huhne’s lies, Mr Clegg said: ‘Newspapers play an incredibly important job in keeping people in positions of authority on their toes, uncovering wrongdoing where that takes place, uncovering the truth where it is not revealed. ‘That is the great tradition of British journalism.’ Huhne brazenly issued denial after denial of the driving licence claims. They included: . May 16, 2011: In a statement, Huhne says the allegations are ‘incorrect’. He adds: ‘They have been made before and they have been shown to be untrue.’ July 7, 2011: On Radio 4’s Today programme, he says: ‘I am saying there is no truth in those allegations ... If Cabinet ministers resigned every time wild allegations were made about them, you would find it difficult to get enough people around the Cabinet table.’ September 20, 2011: At the Liberal Democrat conference, Huhne says: ‘I’ve very clearly denied this. I continue to very strongly deny this.’ Asked if he would ‘swear it’, he says: ‘Absolutely. I’ve made that absolutely and abundantly clear.’ February 3, 2012: Resigning as Energy Secretary as he is charged, Huhne says: ‘I’m innocent of these charges and I intend to fight this.’ Despite his protestations yesterday, the Press’s right to report on Huhne’s affair was backed by the High Court last year. In a victory for Press freedom, Miss Trimingham lost a privacy and harassment claim. Mr Justice Tugendhat ruled that a married MP’s ‘secret mistress’ is a public figure and rejected her claim for damages against the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday. He said she was ‘not the purely private figure she claimed to be’ because of her involvement with  Huhne ‘both professionally, as his press agent, and personally, as his secret mistress, in circumstances where he campaigned with a leaflet to the electorate of Eastleigh about how much he valued his family’. In a damning judgment, in which he accused her of seriously exaggerating some of her evidence and described her as not a ‘good or reliable witness’, the judge added: ‘Miss Trimingham has shown little sign of recognising how what she herself has done has given rise to the publicity she finds so unwelcome.’","Chris Huhne said his downfall was 'payback' for speaking about phonehacking .

This is the 15-month-old girl who survived a horrifying 70ft plunge from her tower-block bedroom. Shantelle Clarke has life-threatening internal injuries after the fall, which her family has blamed on faulty child safety locks fitted to her window. Her distraught parents, Chelsea Westgate, 18, and 23-year-old Craig Clarke, remained at her hospital bedside last night as her condition was described as critical but stable. The couple, who also have a three-year-old son, Kurtis, are believed to have been asleep in another room in the fifth-floor flat at the time of the fall at 8.30am on Saturday in Plymouth. Yesterday, Shantelle’s family hit back at suggestions that her parents, who are engaged and expecting a third child, were to blame. Miss Westgate’s grandmother Doreen Pegg, 75, said: ‘Chelsea and Craig were in bed when it happened and Kurtis and Shantelle were playing in their bedroom. 'I think there must have been something wrong with the safety latch on the window when she fell but no one really knows. It was an awful accident which could have happened to any parent.’ The child’s aunt, Kelly Westgate, claimed on her Facebook page that the incident was down to the ‘window’s safety lock not kicking in’ despite the parents being told they were safe. Another relative, Kerri Phillips, claimed the locks were recently changed and had not been fitted properly. Shantelle's parents Chelsea and Craig are at her bedside at hospital where she is in intensive care. Her family said child locks on the window were faulty and did not work . Shantelle’s grandfather Ian Clarke, 48, who is looking after Kurtis, said: ‘Craig and Chelsea are fantastic parents and are devastated about this. They are in no way to blame. 'This was an accident and it’s upsetting that anybody could think otherwise. ‘Shantelle is in a really bad way and is currently in intensive care. It doesn’t look like she’ll be coming out any time soon. 'We’re all just hoping she’s going to be OK as she’s such a happy and bubbly little girl.’ The past year has been a difficult one for the family. The couple are believed to have been asleep in another room of the fifth-floor flat when Shantelle fell . They escaped an arson attack next to the . flat in October which left them homeless for several months, and in . February they were burgled. Police and child protection officers are believed to be talking to Sanctuary Housing, the firm that owns the six-storey block of flats in the Barne Barton area of Plymouth. A police spokesman said they were not treating the incident as suspicious. Sanctuary Housing refused to comment on concerns over the child safety locks but managing director Simon Clark said: ‘We are doing all we can to assist the police in their investigations and our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time.’","Shantelle Clarke has life-threatening internal injuries after the fall .

Cambridge was the only UK university to make the global top 30 for research, with UCL, Oxford and Imperial making it into the top 50. This suggests that the UK is struggling to keep up with the US in producing cutting-edge research, the authors said. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (last year 1) Harvard (3) Cambridge (2) University College London (4) Imperial College London (6) Oxford (5) Stanford (15) Yale (7) Chicago (8) California Institute of Technology (10) AND Princeton (9) John O'Leary, member of the QS Global Academic Advisory Board, said: 'The UK invests below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average in higher education, so it is unrealistic to expect its universities to continue to punch above their weight indefinitely. 'The current success of leading institutions shows how vital it is that the Government matches the investments being made by other countries in order to maintain their world-class status.' UCL's new president and provost, Professor Michael Arthur, said: 'UCL is undoubtedly one of the world's leading universities and I am pleased to see this reflected in this latest league table position. 'I believe that success in these rankings is down to both our established institutional strengths and our ongoing determination to play a leading role in higher education as it continues to evolve, both in the UK and globally. 'As pleasing as it is, rankings success will not divert us from focusing on our core mission of educating and inspiring our students and delivering world-class research.' Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group, which represents 24 leading universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, said: 'The focus on research excellence and high-quality teaching means the UK performs formidably well against other nations in spite of its size. 'But while funding announced in the recent spending review is welcome, public expenditure on higher education in the UK remains far less than the United States, China and other Western European countries. Mover: Harvard leapfrogged Cambridge to take second place this year . 'If our universities are to compete in the future, they need the Government to provide light-touch regulation and continued investment, and to be welcoming to genuine international students.' Universities minister David Willetts said the results were 'fantastic news' and that UK universities are world-class. He added: 'We are not complacent, and we know we must work hard to remain the best. Our reforms to undergraduate finance have put universities on a sustainable financial footing and sharpened incentives to deliver a world-class student experience.'","Cambridge was the top ranked UK university in the global list .

Labour party bosses are to give Ed Miliband’s wife Justine a more high profile role in a bid to give her husband a popularity boost. The child actress-turned-barrister is expected to make a series of public appearances and speeches at the Labour party conference last this month to ‘humanise’ her husband. But the decision to use Ms Thornton on the political frontline will draw comparisons with failed attempts by Gordon Brown and Iain Duncan Smith to use their other halves to rescue their leadership. Scroll down for video . Secret weapon: Ed Miliband's wife Justine will address activists at this year's party conference as part of a surprise introduction to the political frontline . Ms Thornton has made few appearances since Mr Miliband defeated his brother David to win the Labour leadership three years ago. Mr Miliband repeatedly said he would not copy David Cameron’s habit of eye-catching photo opportunities while opposition leader, and would instead focus on policies. But with the Labour lead over the Tories narrowing in the polls, and Labour rocked by the threat of unions withdrawing millions in funding, Ms Thornton has been persuaded to speak out. Labour planners have pencilled in a series of appearances at the conference in Brighton from September 22, far and beyond the traditional embrace at the end of the leader’s speech. A Labour government would impose a crackdown on the use of zero-hours contracts by 'exploitative' employers, Ed Miliband is to promise trade unions. As many as 5.5 million people could be on the controversial arrangements under which workers do not know if they have work from one week to the next, according to a survey of Unite members. It says the 'staggering' figure - five times previous estimates - show there is a 'growing sub class' of insecure, low paid employees earning an average of £500 a month. Mr Miliband will tell the TUC Congress that while zero hours contracts are useful in some cases they have been 'terribly misused' in many others. Under his proposals employers would be banned from insisting zero-hours workers be available even when there is no guarantee of any work. Ms Thornton will address fringe meetings and parties and be photographed with activists from across the country. A Labour party source said: ‘You will be seeing a lot more of Justine at conference this year. 'She is a huge asset to Ed, she is a huge asset to the Labour but she is her own person. 'She is a career woman with two young children.' ‘She comes across better than him, frankly,’ said another source. The couple met in 2005 and got married in 2011. They have two sons. Mr Miliband faces a rough ride at his conference over his plans to reform Labour's historic links with the trade unions. Britain's union leaders yesterday . branded the Labour leader a ‘schoolboy’ – and warned he was ‘living in . cloud cuckoo land’ if he thought his party reforms would succeed. Dave Prentis, general-secretary of . Unison, said Britain’s biggest public sector union would cut its annual . funding to Labour by £210,000 after the number of members saying they . wanted their fees to go to the party plummeted. He also claimed Mr Miliband’s reforms would lead to a landslide defeat in the next election. The GMB union has already announced it will slash its funding by £1million, with others expected to follow suit. Labour's shadow business secretary . Chuka Umunna admitted the plan to force union members to actively opt-in . to become members of the party will lead to a drop in funding. He told BBC Radio 4: ''I think . undoubtedly it is going to, we’re going to take a hit in terms of our . finances. We will see [how much], but that doesn’t mean that it isn’t . the right thing to do. 'Of course people will be resistant . to change, change frightens people, that is a perfectly natural human . instinct but we have got to do this.' Wed: The couple, who met in 2005, tied the knot at Langar Hall country hotel in Nottinghamshire in May 2011 . Harriet Harman, Labour's deputy . leader, will use a speech to the TUC congress tonight to call for unity . amid fears the row with unions will cause lasting damage to Mr Miliband. 'We need to remember that fundamentally we're fighting for the same things - that we are on the same side,' she will say. 'If . we don't have unity, there is going to be winners and losers. The . winners will be the Tories and the losers will be our constituents and . your members. This is a dangerous moment.' Ms Thornton is no stranger to the . cameras. As a teenager, she carved out a career as an actor, starring in . the ITV series Dramarama, which ran from 1983 and helped launch the . careers of talent including writer Kay Mellor and actor David Tennant. Smiles: Labour insiders were delighted with the reaction in April to Ms Thornton's appearance alongside husband Ed on a tour of her old school, West Bridgford School in Nottingham . Humanise: Advisers hope the sight of the Milibands together in Brighton will change the way voters view the Labour leader . She . also appeared in 1987 school-based sitcom Hardwicke House, which was . axed after just two episodes after being mauled by critics. Labour . advisers were delighted with the reaction to a rare joint public . appearance by the Milibands in the run-up to the local elections. The couple embarked on a visit to her . old school in Nottingham, where the Labour leader admitted that his . ‘troublemaker’ wife would have been ‘too cool’ for him. Meeting . staff at pupils at West Bridgford School, it was revealed Mrs Miliband . broke the rules numerous times while she was a pupil in the 1980s. Rebel rebel: An 18-year-old Justine Thornton starred in the TV show Dramarama filmed in her hometown of Nottingham . It emerged she once leapt from a window to avoid a teacher spotting her wearing lipstick. She also received detentions for wearing a purple coat instead of the regulation black. Asked . if he would have spotted Justine if they had gone to the same school, . Mr Miliband suggested she would have been out of his league. ‘I would definitely have locked eyes on her,’ he told ITV News. ‘But . I think she wouldn’t have had any time for me.’ Turning to his wife he . added: ‘You were obviously too cool – this is what I now realise.’ It sets the scene for a battle of the political wives in the run-up to the 2015 general election. History repeating: In 2009 Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown was introduced on stage at the party conference by wife Sarah who paid tribute to 'my husband, my hero' Tory tactic: Iain Duncan Smith was regularly seen with his wife Betsy as his leadership faltered.

Jeremy Hunt wants every older person to have a named GP who will be responsible for their health. One reason emergency departments have become busier in the past decade is a rise in frail, elderly patients with a number of complicated illnesses. And GP cover is so bad that in some cases A&E staff know patients better than their own doctors, according to Mr Hunt. Hope for help: Jeremy Hunt wants to give extra support to elderly and vulnerable patients by assigning them a designated GP . The Health Secretary believes these patients would be much less likely to end up in hospital if they were properly looked after by family doctors or district nurses in their own homes – because their health would not suddenly deteriorate. He also wants to free family doctors from paperwork so they have more time to see patients – particularly out-of hours when many go to casualty instead. Mr Hunt wants older patients and anyone with serious long-term conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or dementia to have a named doctor responsible for their health. The GP would be tasked with conducting regular check-ups and liaising with relatives and carers about the patient’s treatment. They would also have to ensure patients have contact details for an out-of-hours doctor they could reach when the surgery is closed. Patient support: The Health Secretary believes elderly patients would be much less likely to end up in hospital if they were properly looked after by family doctors or district nurses . As well as keeping track of patients in hospital, the minister argues that GPs should also be involved in the care of those who go into residential care. To aid these proposals Mr Hunt hopes to negotiate new contracts with GPs because he claims those introduced under the last government allow many doctors to avoid offering out-of-hours care. Mr Hunt wrote in the Daily Telegraph: ‘We need a much better way for vulnerable old people to journey through the NHS. ‘They need someone from the service to be keeping tabs and championing them through the system all the time – and making sure they’re a name not a number, whether or not they are in hospital. ‘As a member of the public I would like that responsible person to be my GP.’ He added: ‘GPs don’t want it to be this way, and are themselves working harder than ever before. ‘But sadly the 2004 contract changes . undermined the personal link between GPs and their patients, as well as . imposing a whole range of bureaucratic burdens.’ Increasing numbers: 21.7million people were admitted to A&E last year, a 50 per cent rise in ten years . Last year, 21.7million people attended A&E departments, compared to just over 14million in 2002/3. Many are elderly patients with a long-term condition such as angina, lung disease or diabetes –which has worsened because it is not being properly treated. Ministers will soon outline proposals to help emergency departments cope with the higher demand they face in the winter months and have allocated an extra £500million to NHS trusts. Mr Hunt has said ensuring decent care is given outside hospitals should have equal priority to delivering basic care and respect within hospitals. His remarks are part of a strategy to prioritise patients’ interests over those of NHS staff. Labour has said the Government has failed to support the NHS and warned of a crisis to come in A&E departments. Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘In Jeremy Hunt’s first year in office, nearly one million people waited more than four hours in A&E. ‘Ministers have left it too late and until they face up to the fundamental causes – the collapse of social care and front-line job losses – the NHS will continue to struggle.’ But Mr Hunt has said the Coalition is not to blame for the increased pressure on A&E units which he said is simply down to the ageing population.","Jeremy Hunt urges NHS Trusts to 'champion elderly patients'

Support: Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Nigel Lawson backs tax breaks for married couples . Introducing a generous tax break for married couples would be the most cost-effective way to help families, a former Tory Chancellor said yesterday. Nigel Lawson backed the idea of a transferable tax allowance that would give married people extra money. But he said the Prime Minister’s plans for a tax break worth an extra £150 a year is ‘very limited’ and should be ‘much more generous’. The intervention from Lord Lawson, who was Chancellor in Margaret Thatcher’s government,  comes as backbenchers continue to push David Cameron and George Osborne to carry out their pledge to give married couples a tax break. Mr Cameron promised the transferable allowance worth £150 before the election in 2010. The prospect was raised again this summer. Lord Lawson backed transferable tax allowances – which mean a stay-at-home mother can shift her own income tax-free allowance to her husband – in a report on how to help families from the charity Care. He said: ‘The case for transferable tax allowances remains as strong as ever. ‘They are not only family friendly but provide a far more cost-effective means of reducing the tax burden on low-income households than can be achieved by an across-the-board increase in personal allowances.’ Lord Lawson was the Chancellor who first proposed independent taxation of husbands and wives 25 years ago. Yesterday’s report said that the benefits of separate taxation were undermined by the failure to include transferable allowances. The Care report said: ‘Since 1990 income tax rates have come down. In 1990 the basic rate was 25 per cent; in 2013 it is 20 per cent. 'The tax threshold for single people has risen significantly, with the result that the burden on such individuals has fallen. ‘By contrast, the tax threshold for families is scarcely higher in real terms than it was in 1990, with the result that, even though the basic rate is lower, the income tax burden on some families is much the same as it was then.’ Nearly there: Although the former Chancellor supports David Cameron's tax break, he does not think £150-a-year is generous enough . The report said that the tax system rewards individuals but shows ‘insensitivity to family responsibility’. It added: ‘Independent taxation was intended to give married women privacy over their tax affairs but the two million couples with children who have to claim tax credits, or, in future, Universal Credit, have no privacy. ‘One-earner families face more fiscal discrimination in 2013 than they did in 1990 and marginal tax rates that apply to families are much higher than they were in 1990.’ The report said the unfairness had been worsened by changes to Child Benefit, which have deprived higher-income one-earner families of the benefit while two-earner families on the same family income have kept theirs. The pressure group for stay-at-home mothers, Mothers At Home Matter, welcomed Lord Lawson’s comments. Spokesman Anne Fennell said: ‘Unlike our current Chancellor, Lord Lawson clearly appreciates the injustice in the current tax system towards stay-at-home parents. ‘We welcome his initiative 25 years later to remedy the injustice caused by a tax system which does not recognise the family unit. Many more couples face a “couple penalty” today if they choose to live together as husband and wife than they did 25 years ago and this falls largely in the poorer half of the population.’","Ex-Chancellor Nigel Lawson backs tax break for married couples .

Charles Darwin's grief over watching his daughter-in-law's painful death days after giving birth to his first grandchild is laid bare in personal letters soon to be released online. The naturalist's horror at watching Amy Darwin die in September 1876 is described in a series of letters he wrote to his best friend, the botanist Joseph Hooker. He wrote: 'I am sure you will pity us, when you hear that Amy, Francis' wife was safely confined and was apparently going quite well when she was seized with convulsion which lasted for several hours, she then sunk into a stupor and I saw her expire at 7 o'clock this morning.' The fascinating letters, which have never yet been published, are to be published by Cambridge University by its Darwin Correspondence Project later this month. Darwin's daughter-in-law, Amy, was 26 when she died four days after giving birth to the naturalist's first grandchild, Bernard. The child survived, and was brought up by his father, Francis, and his paternal grandparents. Francis, who worked closely with his father, was later said by Bernard to have never recovered from watching his beloved wife die. Charles Darwin described her as 'a most sweet, gentle creature, with plenty of mind beneath,' and wrote: 'Thank God she... never knew that she was leaving Frank and all of us for ever. 'I cannot think what will become of Frank.  She helped and encouraged him in his scientific work and whether he will ever have heart to go on again...I cannot conceive. 'My Dear Old Friend, I know that you will forgive me pouring out my grief'. Darwin was particularly close to Amy, . who shared his interest in naturalism and was married to the one his . seven children who most closely followed in his own footsteps. Francis, known as Frank, had recently decided against pursuing a career in medicine and had settled in the Kent village of Down, where his parents lived, and begun work as Darwin's personal secretary, assisting him with botanical research and correspondence. The four-page letter from Charles Darwin to his friend Joseph Hooker tells of his daughter-in-law's death . 'I cannot think what will become of Frank': Darwin writes of his worries for his bereaved son . Hooker replied: 'My dear, dear Darwin, I cannot tell you how I feel for Frank and Mrs Darwin and yourself. 'It seems to open up my own all too recent loss, and to depress me utterly - poor, poor Frank, my heart bleeds for him: they were so happy and she so loveable - how I envied them a few months ago!' Darwin then wrote to Hooker a few days later, saying: 'Poor Amy had severe convulsions due to wrong action of the kidneys; after the convulsions she sunk into a stupor from which she never rallied. 'It is an inexpressible comfort that she never suffered & never knew she was leaving her beloved husband for ever. 'It has been a most bitter blow to us all.' He added: '  I never saw anyone suffer so much as poor Frank. He has gone to N. Wales to bury the body in a little church-yard amongst the mountains, & I do not know when he will return'. Paul White, who edits the Project, told MailOnline that Amy 'was a favourite with all the Darwin family'. He said: 'Darwin's letter to Hooker after Amy's death also suggests the closeness that he feels for his son. This was very characteristic of Darwin, who always showed a great deal of concern for his children and was frequently anxious about their future happiness.' The letters show another, deeply personal side to the naturalist Charles Darwin, who wrote The Origin Of Species . Dr White added: 'Hooker was Darwin's closest friend and they corresponded over almost their entire adult lives, so there was a kind of bond there that was special. 'They shared feelings which they didn't share with others, so this correspondence offers a wonderful insight into what it was like to be them.  It shows us Darwin from the inside rather than the public Darwin. 'When there are moments of crisis they do share these moments with each other.' Francis went on to marry again twice, and his son Bernard went on to be educated at Eton and Cambridge before becoming a golf writer. Darwin and Hooker, a botanist and explorer who later ran the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, had both lost children previously, and had poured out feelings to each other that they had not been able to tell others. The historic papers form part of the world's largest collection of Darwin's papers - some 9,000 letters - and will be released on the Darwin Correspondence Project website later this week.","Charles Darwin exchanged 1,400 letters with botanist friend Joseph Hooker .

Pushy parents are damaging their children’s chances of getting into university by becoming personally involved in the admissions process, a leading headteacher has warned. Mothers and fathers are increasingly contacting universities themselves, thinking they will help secure a place on a good course for their child. But Girls’ School Association president Hilary French warned it could have the opposite effect - and told teenagers not to let their parents near the phone. Confidence: A leading headteacher says students must pluck up the courage to speak to universities themselves . ‘It comes down to the whole “helicopter parenting” thing,’ said Mrs French, who is also head of Central Newcastle High School. ‘It is better to have an over-interested parent than uninterested parent and you can understand why they want to be involved because their children are making a huge investment now in their university education. But there must be boundaries to this. ‘Now is not the time to be nervous on the telephone and it’s certainly not the day for letting your parents fight your battles for you. ‘By all means discuss your options with them but if you have to talk to universities you’re on your own.’ She was backed by Clare Reseigh, head of sixth form at St Gabriel’s School near Newbury, West Berkshire. ‘If you have to ring universities to confirm or re-negotiate your place, it goes without saying that it must be you who calls,’ she said. ‘Under no circumstances allow your parents to call on your behalf because that will send entirely the wrong message about your maturity and commitment.’ The warning comes the week before hundreds of thousands of teenagers get their A-level results. Advice: Students applying for university places should not allow parents to call up on their behalf, experts say . Those who do not automatically win a place can enter the clearing system. Some who get better grades than expected can also try trading up to a better university or course. Parents have increasingly been taking an active role in the process of applying to university as costs have soared - making the return on the investment more important. Students starting courses this year will pay up to £9,000 in tuition fees alone. Once living costs are taking into account, debts can spiral to more than £40,000 for a three-year course. Adding to the frenzy this year is the decision of an unprecedented number of elite Russell Group universities, including Sheffield and Birmingham, to offer places through clearing. Half of teenagers were accompanied by parents at university open days in 2011, according to one survey. Two years earlier the figure was 47 per cent. Mothers and fathers are also exercising their influence by filling out their application forms and fighting appeals on their children’s behalf, according to universities. Helen Ness-Gifford, headteacher of Pipers Corner in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, also advised students who don’t make the grades they want to demonstrate their independence to admissions tutors. ‘The most important thing is for you - not your parents - to talk to the university concerned, then look at clearing,’ she said.","Leading headteacher warns parents against ringing universities to try and secure them a place on a good course .

Reluctant dieters often dream of being able to eat whatever they want at dinner without gaining weight. Now one health writer claims he can make the dream a reality – but only by imposing a strict vegan diet during the day. Mark Bittman has gained thousands of followers in the US with his VB6 diet, which stands for Vegan Before 6pm. Virtue: A new diet encourages people to eat only vegan food during the daytime in order to lose weight . Eat only vegetables all day, he says, and the kitchen’s your oyster come sunset. Whether you crave steak, a cheeseburger or a rich chocolate mousse, nothing is barred as long as it is eaten in moderation. Mr Bittman, 63, claims it helped him lose 15 per cent of his body weight and saved him from developing diabetes. Now the craze is taking off in the UK after his best-selling book was published here this summer. Vegans eat no animal products, basing their meals on healthy fruit, vegetables and grains, which are high in fibre and nutrients. Reward: The plan allows dieters to chow down on meat after six o'clock every evening . Mr Bittman describes his ‘flexitarian’ – or semi-vegetarian – plan as a compromise for those who want to be healthy but can’t face giving up the animal foods they love, which are often high in saturated fat. The author, a food writer for 30 years, adopted the diet seven years ago after doctors said he was pre-diabetic. With high cholesterol and blood sugar, he was told to cut out unhealthy foods or go on medication. Pioneer: Mark Bittman says his diet will revolutionise people's health and lifestyles . He said: ‘It was the best compromise I could come up with between an all-plant diet and eating the way I was eating. ‘The strategy is common sense. If there’s one or two things that science has found in the last few decades, it’s eat more plants and less junk – this is one way of doing that.’ Mr Bittman said it helped him lose 1st in a month and 1st 7lb in the next few months. His book, with 60 vegan recipes for lunch and breakfast, topped the New York Times How-To bestseller book list in the US. Unlike other diets, which promise fast results, he emphasises it is not a ‘quick-fix’ option. He said: ‘This is a life-long plan. You don’t just do it for three months and give it up. It’s about eating in a way that’s better for you. Many people are overweight and are eating way too much meat and this is a strategy for changing that.’ Eating less saturated fat can reduce the risk of obesity, heart disease and diabetes. But Yvonne Wake, lecturer in nutrition at Roehampton University, said: ‘It is true that vegans lose weight. ‘But there’s a slight problem in eating animal products in the evening. It makes more sense to have a big breakfast with eggs and bacon and then go down to vegetables for lunch and dinner. Breakfast is very important as your body needs a kick-start at the beginning of the day.’","Mark Bittman says his diet allowed him to shed 15% of his body weight .

The badly decomposed bodies of a Brazilian family have been found in their home in Sao Paulo near to a message scrawled on a wall which read: 'God forgive me. I couldn't look after my children'. Neighbours became concerned over the weekend when they noticed a strong odour coming from the proerty in Cotia. The family had not been seen since last Friday. When police broke into the three bedroom home they discovered Claudine Pedrotti Junior, 39, his wife, Suelen Cristina da Silva, 26, and their two children, Victoria, two and Peter Henry, seven, lying on the same bed in the main bedroom. Decomposed: Suelen Cristina da Silva (left) and her children Victoria and Peter Henry (right) The message had been written in crayon on a kitchen wall. Four dinner plates, still with food, were set out on the kitchen table showing how the family sat down to eat their last meal before they died. Police suspect the phrase was written by the father before he killed himself and his family. Investigators suspect that one or both of the parents in collusion used poison. Dr. Joaquim, a coroner from the Institute of Criminology of Taboão da Serra, Sao Paulo, said there was no evidence of violence. He reported that there were small pools of blood near the bodies but no traces of gunshots or bullet wounds. Shock: Neighbours stand outside the house where the family were found dead in Sao Paulo . Investigators have been collecting evidence at the crime scene where the badly decomposed bodies of a family were found . Neighbours of the couple told police they heard the family's car engine running inside the garage in the front of the house . After carrying out an initial investigation of the scene he concluded that 'it could be a case of poisoning.' Investigators said they found no firearms in the property. Both husband and wife worked as hairdressers and ran their own salon in Santa Maria Jardim about 21km from where they lived. According . to a relative the family was facing serious financial difficulties and . Pedrotti Jnr had complained about their problems a fortnight before. The electricity was about to be cut off and they were behind with their rent in both their house and their business. A next door neighbour, close to tears, said the family were friendly and well-liked in the community adding: 'This is a real shock for everyone, particularly with the death of the children. 'We just don’t understand why this has happened.' Police suspect the father may have agreed with his wife to poison the children and taken their own lives because of their financial difficulties. Dr Andreas Schiffmann, forensic investigator, said: 'Our main task now is to discover exactly what happened here and what is the cause of the murder and the suicide. 'Everything leads us to believe that they used the poison called ""chumbinho""', he added. Otherwise known as veneno and nicknamed ‘BB’ in Brazil, the poison, which comes in the shape of small pellets, is used in pesticides mainly to kill rats. Once ingested by humans or animals the victims suffers sharp stomach pains leading to vomiting. The poison damages the immune system, cells and tissues, causing death within minutes. Investigation: Police leave the home where the family were found dead on Sunday in Sao Paulo . Neighbours of the couple told police that on Friday at around 11pm they heard the family’s car engine running inside the garage in the front of the house. The family did not appear again. Around 9am on Sunday locals complained of a strong stench coming from the family's residence. At first they thought it was rotting garbage. 'The smell coming from the house was not good and we didn’t know why that was,' explained a resident. 'At first we thought it was the smell of rubbish. But then we noticed there was no movement inside the house and it was all closed up.  So we became really concerned and decided to try to find out.' A local boy was asked to climb up to the window ledge and look inside the house by one of the neighbours. Based on initial reports, police believe Claudine killed Suelen and her children with poison then killed himself . Peering through the window into the master bedroom the boy said he could see the bodies of the family lying together on the bed. The boy, who has not been named, broke a pane of glass to check what had happened, then warned the neighbour. He said he did not dare look at the corpses because they were already in an advanced state of decomposition. When police arrived at the scene, they had to break down the front door of the house because it was locked. The door to the main bedroom was also bolted and they had to force their way in. The four bodies were found lying on the bed. The father was lying on his stomach, his left arm cuddling the daughter with the son lying beside his sister. On the father's right, lay the mother also on face down. Neighbours stand outside the house where a message was scrawled on the kitchen wall which said: 'God forgive me, I could not take care of my children' In the kitchen the police found what they believe was a suicide note written on the wall in coloured crayon. 'I could not take care of my children,' the message said. Experts took away the plates with the food and a bottle of soda for further analysis. On the cooker, the remains of rice, beans and some meat were still in the saucepans. Autopsies on the bodies were being carried out on Monday. In Brazil around 25 people a day commit suicide. Between 1998 and 2008, government figures show the total number of suicides in the country increased by 33.5 per cent, higher than the number of murders and the number of deaths from road accidents. In Brazil, suicide is now categorised as the third leading cause of death, a high proportion of them, according to researchers, is as a result of depression or from some form of mental disorder.","Claudine Pedrotti Junior, 39, Suelen Cristina da Silva, 26, and their two children, found lying dead on the same bed .

Electronic cigarettes are as effective as nicotine patches in getting smokers to quit, according to the first study to compare them. Battery-operated E-cigarettes look like real cigarettes and turn nicotine into a vapour inhaled by the user. There is little information about the possible side-effects of the nicotine but it is the tar and other toxins in cigarettes which are deadly, not the nicotine. New study: E-cigarettes are just as likely to help smokers quit as nicotine patches according to new research . The study recruited 657 smokers who wanted to quit. Nearly 300 were given e-cigarettes while roughly the same number got nicotine patches. Just over 70 were given placebo e-cigarettes without any nicotine. After six months, similar rates of smokers – 6 to 7 per cent – managed to quit after using either the nicotine-containing e-cigarettes or patches. Four per cent of smokers using the placebo quit. Among smokers who hadn’t quit, nearly 60 per cent of those using e-cigarettes had cut down the number of cigarettes smoked by at least half, versus 41 per cent of those using nicotine patches. Researchers at the National Institute for Health Innovation at the University of Auckland also found similar rates of side-effects in smokers who used the e-cigarettes and the patches. Comparison: The study by Auckland University professors tested the efficacy of both e-cigarettes and patches . The most common side effect in all groups was breathing problems. ‘This research provides an important benchmark for e-cigarettes,’ said Chris Bullen, director of the National Institute for Health Innovation at the University of Auckland, the study’s lead author. ‘We have now shown they are about as effective as a standard nicotine replacement product.’ Popular: Smokers were big fans of the e-cigarettes with many saying they would recommend them to a friend who is trying to quit . Smokers were also much bigger fans of the e-cigarettes; nearly 90 percent of users said they would recommend them to a friend compared to just over half of people who got patches. Peter Hajek, an anti-smoking expert at Queen Mary University of London, called it a ‘pioneering’ study and said health officials should seriously consider recommending e-cigarettes to smokers who want to quit or cut down. ‘E-cigarettes also have the potential to replace cigarettes as a consumer product, so their value is not just as a treatment,’ he said. ‘That could stop the tobacco-related disease and death epidemic if everyone switches to a safer way of nicotine delivery,’ he said. He added that although more studies were needed on the long-term safety of e-cigarettes, there weren’t any imminent warning signs. ‘E-cigarettes may not be perfectly safe, but even if some currently unknown risk materializes, they are likely to be orders of magnitude safer than normal cigarettes,’ he said. Britain and the EU are planning to regulate e-cigarettes as medical devices, a decision that has provoked criticism from some scientists who argue that would limit their availability to help smokers while cigarettes are not as tightly regulated.","A study by the University of Auckland is the first to compare the two methods of quitting .

Teenagers who see friends smoking and drinking alcohol in photographs posted on Facebook are more likely to smoke and drink themselves, according to the report. ‘Our study shows that adolescents can be influenced by their friends’ online pictures to smoke or drink alcohol,’ said Dr Thomas Valente, professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California and the study’s principal investigator. Teenagers who see friends smoking and drinking alcohol in photographs posted on Facebook are more likely to smoke and drink themselves, new research suggests . ‘To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply social network analysis methods to examine how teenagers’ activities on online social networking sites influence their smoking and alcohol use.’ Dr Valente and his team surveyed 1,563 15 and 16-year-old students about their online and offline friendship networks, the frequency of their social media use, their smoking, and their alcohol consumption. The researchers found that the size of a student’s online network of friends was not significantly associated with risky behaviour. Exposure to friends’ online pictures of partying or drinking, however, was significantly associated with both smoking and alcohol use. Teenagers whose close friends did not drink alcohol were more likely to be affected by increasing exposure to risky online pictures. ‘The evidence suggests that friends’ online behaviours are a viable source of peer influence,’ said Dr Grace Huang, the study’s first and corresponding author. ‘This is important to know, given that 95 per cent of 12 to 17-year-olds in the United States access the Internet every day, and 80 per cent of those youth use online social networking sites to communicate.’ Teenagers whose close friends do not drink alcohol are more likely to be affected by increasing exposure to risky online pictures. The size of a student's online network of friends is not associated with risky behaviour . Nearly 30 per cent of survey’s respondents had smoked and more than half had had at least one drink of alcohol. Roughly one-third of the students reported having at least one friend who smoked and/or consumed alcohol. The study found that Facebook-only users had higher grades, spoke more English at home and were more likely to have a higher socio-economic status . Almost half of all students reported visiting Facebook and Myspace regularly. Between October 2010 and April 2011, Facebook use - 75 per cent - increased while Myspace use - 13 per cent - decreased. On average, 34 per cent of students had at least one friend who talked about partying online and 20 per cent reported that their friends posted drinking pictures online. In line with earlier studies, the researchers observed differences between Facebook and Myspace users. Facebook-only users had higher grades, spoke more English at home and were more likely to have a higher socio-economic status. They were less likely to be Hispanic and less likely to have ever smoked or consumed alcohol. While Facebook use did not seem to affect smoking or drinking, the study found that higher levels of Myspace use was associated with higher levels of drinking. ‘Little is known about how social media use affects adolescent health behaviours,’ said Dr Huang, who is a post-doctoral fellow at the National Cancer Institute. ‘Our study suggests that it may be beneficial to teach teens about the harmful effects of posting risky behaviours online and how those displays can hurt their friends.’","Study found that adolescents are influenced by friends' online pictures .

With their sash windows, open fires and wooden floors, period properties are popular first family homes. But renovating an old house while pregnant could put mothers-to-be and their unborn children at risk, experts have warned. They say DIY on such properties can release lead from old paintwork, a poison that can raise blood pressure, putting women at risk of pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy complication that can be fatal to both mother and child. Researchers also found that open fires can pose a serious risk, as burning coal releases lead particles into the air. Passed from mother to baby in the womb, the toxin can also stunt intelligence and may make children hyperactive. It is thought that even relatively small amounts can be dangerous. The Bristol University study also flagged up alcohol, coffee and even pet dogs as potential sources of lead in pregnancy. Dr Caroline Taylor, an expert in the effect of various metals on children’s growth and development, looked at lead readings in blood samples taken from more than 4,000 pregnant women from the Bristol area. Readings were higher than those found in similar groups in other developed countries – and were particularly high in women who were educated to degree level. This was unexpected as it is normally thought that exposure to environmental toxins is higher in poorer populations. The researchers are not sure why better-educated women are at greater risk, but speculate it is because they are more likely to buy older homes and renovate them. Although lead is now banned in paint, it can still be released from woodwork that is being stripped of its original paintwork. Potential sources include cornices and skirting boards, as well as floorboards that are being stripped down to create fashionable bare-look flooring. Danger: DIY can release lead from old paintwork, researchers warned . Writing in the journal PLoS ONE, Dr Taylor said: ‘A possible explanation is that women with higher educational attainment lived on older housing stock rather than on modern estates and were perhaps involved in the renovation of older properties; this might cause exposure to lead-based paints, through sanding old woodwork, and to large amounts of dust that has accumulated over many decades.’ However, the factor she found to be most strongly linked with lead levels in a pregnant woman’s blood was having a coal fire at home. Coal contains lead which is released in smoke. Dr Taylor did not find any evidence that wood-burning stoves, which are becoming increasingly popular, cause a similar problem. However, alcohol, coffee and smoking were all linked to higher levels of lead while eating foods rich in iron and calcium was associated with lower readings. Surprisingly, the study found that women who had a pet dog also tended to have higher amounts of lead in their blood. The effect was small but could be caused by the pets bringing contaminated soil and dust inside. The study is the largest of its kind ever done in the UK. The samples were taken in the early 1990s as part of a long-running health project. The use of lead has fallen since then, but with even small amounts of the metal believed to be dangerous, Dr Taylor believes it is important that pregnant women are aware of the risk. She said that they should not be alarmed but follow the general advice for a healthy pregnancy, including stopping or reducing alcohol and coffee intake and quitting smoking. The researcher added: ‘If you have a house that was built before 1960 and you are scraping away original paint, you might want to think twice about that.’","Lead poisoning puts women at risk of pre-eclampsia - fatal to mother and child .

All adults aged 70 and those aged 79 will be offered a jab. This is great for anyone vulnerable to this painful condition which affects one in five adults. Shingles, or herpes zoster, is an infection of a nerve and the area of skin around it. Around 800,000 people will  be eligible for the vaccine. Protected: The UK-wide vaccination programme is set to protect elderly against shingles . Why is the vaccine only being offered to people aged 70 or 79? It’s a catch-up programme. Each year, all those who are 70 and all those who are  79 will be vaccinated. It is the quickest and most cost-effective way of getting the most at-risk people vaccinated. After nine years, it’ll just be offered to people when they reach 70. Why do people get shingles? Anyone who has had chickenpox can get shingles. The virus lies inactive in your nerve cells for life. Shingles is a reactivation of this chickenpox virus which appears as a painful, sore rash. Can anyone get shingles? It affects 20 per cent of the population and is most common in adults. It gets you when you’re down and your immune system is weak. The shot will be available for men and women aged 70 and aged 79 . How can I opt into the vaccination? Your GP will offer a single jab in the arm. If it’s just a rash, why is the vaccine necessary? Shingles is very painful and causes great suffering. While the rash usually lasts two to three weeks, people often have permanent pain in the area of the rash. This neuralgia is debilitating and very difficult to treat. One in 1,000 people over 70 will die from shingles. Can you have the jab if you’ve had shingles? Yes. Once you have had shingles you are at a higher risk than normal of getting it again. The vaccine will make  a repeated attack less likely. Can you get the vaccine if you are under 70? It is licensed for the over 50s and you can get the jab privately. If you have a medical condition that puts you at higher risk of shingles, chat to your doctor about whether it is worth it.","UK-wide vaccination programme against shingles .

Researchers have discovered a protein that they claim is the missing link to the development of Alzheimer’s disease. They found that blocking this protein with an existing drug can restore memory in mice with brain damage that mimics the disease. The findings could offer hope of developing drugs to slow the degenerative illness. Alzheimer's causes a decrease in the size of the brain, shown here by the enlarged ventricle cavities (white, at centre of brain) and the widened pale blue regions. Researchers now believe they have found the 'missing link' that triggers the disease . 'What is very exciting is that of all the links in this molecular chain, this is the protein that may be most easily targeted by drugs,' said the study’s senior author Stephen Strittmatter at Yale School of Medicine. The study offers hope of developing drugs to slow the degenerative illness . 'This gives us strong hope that we can find a drug that will work to lessen the burden of Alzheimer’s.' During Alzheimer's disease protein 'plaques' develop in the structure of the brain, leading to the death of brain cells. People with Alzheimer's also have a shortage of some important chemicals in their brain involved with the transmission of messages within the brain. Scientists have already provided a partial molecular map of how Alzheimer’s disease destroys brain cells. In earlier work, Professor Strittmatter’s lab showed that the amyloid-beta peptides, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s, couple with prion proteins. By an unknown process, the coupling activates a molecular messenger called Fyn. The new findings, published in the journal Neuron, reveals the missing link in the chain, a protein within the cell membrane called metabotropic glutamate receptor 5, or mGluR5. When the protein is blocked by a drug similar to one being developed for Fragile X syndrome, the deficits in memory, learning, and synapse density were restored in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s. Prof Strittmatter stressed that new drugs may have to be designed to precisely target the amyloid-prion disruption of mGluR5 in human cases of Alzheimer’s and said his lab is exploring new ways to achieve this. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, currently affecting around 496,000 people in the UK.","Blocking the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 protein may repair memory .

Women who are a healthy weight are more likely to get breast cancer when using hormone replacement therapy, according to a new study . Women who are a healthy weight are more likely to get breast cancer when using hormone replacement therapy, according to a new study. Breast cancer has long been associated with the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) during the menopause. Scientists say this risk is increased among certain groups - including white women with a healthy body mass index (BMI). Researchers at the University of Chicago analysed 1,642,824 mammograms, which included 9,300 breast cancer cases, from menopausal women. Data on HRT use was analysed by ethnicity, age, BMI and breast density for the Journal of the National Cancer Institute study. Results showed there was a 20 per cent increased risk of breast cancer associated with HRT use among white and Hispanic women, but not black women. HRT use was more strongly associated with breast cancer risk in women with low or normal BMI, but no link was found among those with a high BMI. Women with denser breasts also had an increased chance of breast cancer while using HRT. The researchers found a significant relationship between breast density and HRT independent of BMI. HRT use was not associated with breast cancer for women with high BMI and low breast density, whereas HRT use was associated with a significantly higher risk of disease for women with low or normal BMI and high breast density. The researchers say the results show HRT may be used for some women without increasing breast cancer risk. There is a 20 per cent increased risk of breast cancer associated with HRT use among white and Hispanic women, but not black women. Image shows breast cancer cells . Lead author Dr Ningqui Hou said: ‘Black women, obese women, and women with breast tissue composed largely of fat may benefit from HRT use with minimal excess breast cancer risk. ‘Further studies to confirm these findings and provide more information on other modifiable risk factors for breast cancer in relation to HRT use are needed.’ Dr Mary Beth Terry, from the Department of Epidemiology and the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Centre at Columbia University, said: ‘Ultimately, efforts that improve risk stratification, whether made through improved risk models or through measuring valid intermediate biomarkers such as breast density, will inform appropriate use of not only HRT, but also other medications, including chemopreventive drugs.’","White and Hispanic women are at greater risk than black women are .

Transverse myelitis is a neurological condition that triggers inflammation of the spinal cord. It is thought to be caused by a virus experts remain unsure of the exact cause. It is very rare and affects just 300 Britons each year. Symptoms include weakness, 'heaviness' and numbness of the limbs. In severe cases this can lead to total paralysis. It may also cause someone to be more sensitive to touch, cold, and heat. There may also be tight and painful muscle contractions (known as . tonic muscle spasms). The symptoms and signs depend upon the extent of the spinal cord affected. Around 70 per cent of sufferers will never recover but intensive physiotherapy can help reduce symptoms. 'No-one knows what brings it on. At least if you fall off a ladder, you know why you can’t walk, but with this, you just don’t know and that’s the frustration.'

Researchers at the University of California say their NeuroRacer game rejuvenated the brains of pensioners after only 12 hours . A simple video game devised by scientists dramatically rejuvenated the brains of pensioners after only 12 hours. The improvements were so great, they did better than those in their 20s at the driving-based challenge, said researchers. The multi-tasking ability, memory and attention span of the men and women aged 60 to 85 were all boosted by the ‘brain training’ with some of the benefits still obvious six months later. The scientists said that their technique could be used to keep healthy older adults ‘at the top of their game’ for longer. Brain . training is a popular way of trying to keep the mind sharp into old age . but views about its value to everyday life are mixed. However, . the researchers at the University of California believe their . NeuroRacer game is different as it was designed to improve . multi-tasking, a skill known to deteriorate with age. Players . use a joystick to navigate a car along a winding road while various . signs pop up. Users must push a button when they see one particular sign . while ignoring all the others. The game gets more difficult as a player improves but shouldn’t become so difficult that it is too frustrating to enjoy. Tests showed that a small amount of . practice led to rapid improvements. After just 12 hours of using it on a . laptop at home over a month, the pensioners fared better than players . who were decades younger. Working memory and attention span also improved, despite the game not aiming to do this, reported the journal Nature. Dr Adam Gazzaley, who has patented NeuroRacer, believes it does more to train the brain than other methods like crosswords and card games. Dr Adam Gazzaley said his game does more to train the brain than other methods like crosswords . Alexandra Trelle, of Cambridge University’s memory lab, said the results should encourage people to strive to improve their mind sharp and agile throughout life. She said that games like NeuroRacer aren’t the only option – with activities such as learning a new language or taking up a musical instrument likely to be more fun and at least as beneficial. Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘The ability to improve cognitive health in old age could be crucial in the search for new treatments and preventions for dementia.’","Researchers said NeuroRacer helps improve multi-tasking and is better than crosswords at brain-training .

For ten years, she wore false eyelashes every day to give her the glamorous look she craved. But Caroline Medcalf’s ‘addiction’ to the enhancements came at a price, damaging her natural lashes so severely that hardly any were left. In desperation, the 42-year-old sought medical  help – and has now become the first patient in the UK to go public after undergoing a pioneering eyelash transplant. Ms Medcalf, from Worsley, Greater Manchester, (pictured after her transplant) said her life has been transformed by the eyelash transplant operation at the Crown Clinic in Manchester . Miss Medcalf spent £4,000 having 70 eyelashes  transplanted into her eyelids in a three-hour operation. A . strip of hair was taken from the back of her scalp and the individual . hair follicles removed. The surgeon then threaded each hair into the . skin at the bottom of her eyelids using a special needle. Miss . Medcalf said: ‘I am so pleased I have had it done. The only new beauty . routine I will have to adopt is curling and trimming my new lashes every . couple of weeks. ‘Because they are made from head hair they grow in just the same  way and need more grooming than natural eyelashes.’ The . finance director was left with just three eyelashes on her upper right . lid and 19 on her upper left lid after years of damage caused by gluing . on extensions. She said: ‘I was spending around £100 every couple of months buying them, along with the glue and solutions for my eyes. Consequences: Caroline Medcalf, 42, said she ended up looking like a 'frog' when she lost most of her natural lashes . Dr Shahmalak transplanted 70 new eyelashes in each of Caroline's eyelids in a three hour operation. This image was taken shortly afterwards . Pictured her with her transplanted lashes, Ms Medcalf said: 'It feels like a miracle to have hair on my eyelids when for so long there was nothing. I will now have lovely long, natural eyelashes for the rest of my life - and need never wear false eyelashes again' ‘I . would never take them out and left no time for my normal eyelashes to . recover after their use. Gradually my lashes started falling out – which . made me even more dependent on the extensions.’ The damage was made . worse when she got an eye infection a year ago which caused itching, and . she rubbed off many of the weakened lashes that were left. Increasing numbers of women are damaging their eyelashes permanently due having overindulged in synthetic lashes like Ms Medcalf (pictured) With . almost completely bald upper lids, Miss Medcalf was too embarrassed to . leave her house or let her family, boyfriend or friends see her without . false eyelashes. She recalled: ‘I ended up looking like a frog. I could not bear to look at myself in the mirror.’ But . Miss Medcalf, from Worsley, Greater Manchester, said her life has now . been transformed by the operation at the Crown Clinic in Manchester.

Shahmalak, who carried out Miss Medcalf’s transplant, said: ‘Lots of . women permanently damage their eyelashes by overusing false ones. The . glue can block the hair follicle and they can end up losing their . natural lash. ‘The problem has been made worse by the boom in their use in recent years, thanks to celebrities such as Cheryl Cole. ‘I . also see women needing eyelash transplants who have suffered from . trichotillomania – a psychological conditions which sees them rip out . their eyelashes.’ Dr .

Kieran Carroll, seven, made sure his two-year-old brother, Layton, did not panic before calling for help when his mother, Rebecca Carroll, collapsed. Ms Carroll, who has Type 1 diabetes, was at home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, with her sons when her blood sugar level plummeted causing her to collapse. Kieran Carroll (left), seven, called for help and looked after his brother, Layton (right), two, when his mother, Rebecca Carroll (centre), collapsed at home. Ms Carroll has been a Type 1 diabetic for 15 years . Ms Carroll, 30, said: ‘I’d just come out of hospital after suffering from a viral infection and so my blood sugar was a bit all over the place. ‘I was on my own with the boys at home, and when I could feel my blood sugar dipping, I had a chocolate bar and a drink to try and stabilise it. ‘But the next thing I knew I was waking up and everyone was standing around me. Two of my neighbours were there and half of my family were all staring at me.’ Ms Carroll and her partner Mark Wood, 34, have taught Kieran what to do if he cannot wake his mother up. ‘We have always told him that if ever he can’t wake me, he needs to call for help,’ Ms Carroll said. ‘He knows how to use my iPhone and he can find the numbers for various family members. When his mother collapsed, Kieran (centre) walked across a busy road with his brother to find his neighbours, Sunil Nadkar (left) and Sandra Best (right) who called an ambulance . ‘I have been diabetic for 15 years and from Kieran being an early age he has seen me injecting myself on a daily basis, so I thought it was important to tell him what I am doing. ‘I also didn’t want him thinking it was something he should try.’ When Ms Carroll collapsed, Kieran took care of Layton, and led him safely across a busy road to knock on a neighbour’s door, before calling his aunt, Lindsay Smith. An ambulance was called and paramedics rushed to the scene to give Ms Carroll a potentially life-saving glucose injection to bring her back to consciousness. If Kieran had not found help, Ms Carroll could have slipped into a diabetic coma or even died. Ms Carroll says that she has taught Kieran (right) what to do in an emergency so he knew that when he could not wake her he should go and find their neighbour, Sandra Best (left) The proud mother praised quick-thinking Kieran for coming to the rescue. Ms Carroll said: ‘Our front garden goes straight out onto the road so I worry about him crossing that on his own. Ms Carroll (pictured) said: 'I'm really proud and I can't get over how grown-up he was. He's my hero' ‘But when he knocked on the neighbour’s door, he and Layton were standing there holding hands. He was really looking after him. ‘I’m really proud and I can’t get over how grown-up he was. He’s my hero. ‘If it wasn’t for him, I might not still be here today.’ The schoolboy is now set for a special treat, to thank him for his brave efforts. Ms Carroll said: ‘We told him that we will give him a treat for all that he has done. ‘He will get a meal at his favourite restaurant and we are going to take him on a day trip wherever he wants to go. ‘We will be telling Layton what he needs to do in the future as well so they both know exactly what they have to do in an emergency.’ Ms Smith, 33, said: ‘He is an absolute superstar. We always told him to get help if something happened and it just shows that he listened.’ Ben Holdaway, director for Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said: ‘A big well done to Kieran for his actions and for staying calm when he faced what must have been a very difficult situation. ‘He did the right thing to get help for his mum and she must be very proud of him.’ Type 1 diabetes develops when the insulin producing cells in the body have been destroyed and the body is unable to produce any insulin. This means that it is unable to regulate the body's blood sugar levels. When the blood sugar levels fall too low this is known as a 'hypo' - it occurs when the blood sugar level drops below four millimoles per litre. Warning signs that blood sugar levels are falling include feeling hungry, trembling, sweating and difficulty concentrating. The best way of preventing a hypo is to eat or drink something sugary. If it is not treated, it can lead to unconsciousness, coma, and eventually death. The safest way for a diabetic to avoid a hypo is to regularly check their blood sugar and to eat regularly.

Conjoined twins who shared spinal cords have successfully been separated during a gruelling eighteen-hour operation. The operation on one-year-old Nigerian sisters Hussaina and Hassana Badaru involved 40 doctors, and is only the fourth such separation to be carried out in the world. The pair, who were born with a condition called pygopagus in Kano, Nigeria, were joined at the hip and had spinal cord fusion, while also sharing a lower gastrointestinal passage and genitalia. Scroll down for video . Nigerian twins Hassana (left) and Hussaina (right) Badaru were separated during an 18 hour operation in New Delhi. They are pictured after the operation with their parents, Badaru Mannir and Malama Badariyya Badaru . Specialist surgeons at BLK Super Speciality Hospital in New Delhi, India, conducted the separation on August 12. They carried out two procedures - one to divide the twins, and one reconstructive operation. The procedures - which cost an estimated £64,000 and were paid for by a Nigerian philanthropist - were so risky that doctors were forced to conduct practice runs on dummies before attempting it for real. Dr Prashant Jain, the paediatric surgeon who led the team, said: ‘The separation of the Badaru twins was a big challenge as they had unusual sharing of alimentary canal, genitourinary system and nervous system. ‘We overcame this with meticulous planning and team work. Rehearsals were carried out using dummies. ‘Every surgical step was defined and rehearsed over and over again till it reached precision. The operation on the sisters (pictured before surgery) involved 40 doctors, and is only the fourth such separation to be carried out in the world. The procedure was conducted at BLK Super Speciality Hospital . ‘The girls were colour coded, one pink and the other blue, for eight days before the surgery so that there would be no error at all. ‘All tubes, wires, catheters, leads, syringes, injections and drugs were also colour coded in accordance with the pink or blue code to avoid any error or miscalculation.’ Head of anaesthesiology, Dr Valecha, added: ‘The most difficult task in this surgery was the anaesthetist’s job which was challenging by the fact that whatever drug was given to one twin, the other would receive it inadvertently through a large sharing vein therefore it needed to be calculated and monitored carefully.’ The pair, who were born with a condition called pygopagus, were joined at the hip and had spinal cord fusion, while also sharing a lower gastrointestinal passage and genitalia. Scan shows the twins before their operation . he procedures - which cost an estimated £64,000 and were paid for by a Nigerian philanthropist - were so risky that doctors were forced to conduct practice runs on dummies . For the girls’ parents, father Badaru, and mother Malama Badariyya Badaru, it was the culmination of a long process to save their daughters. After the babies were born in Murtala Muhammed Specialist Hospital, Kano, last year, they sought the help of local doctors to separate their twins. But the diagnosis was simple - one of the girls would have to be sacrificed to save the other in order to carry out the separation surgery. The girls (pictured before their operation) were born in Murtala Muhammed Specialist Hospital, Nigeria, last year, but doctors in Nigeria felt they would be unable to separate them without sacrificing one of the twins . Dr Prashant Jain, the paediatric surgeon who led the team, said that every step of the operation was practiced in advance. Image shows the twins and their parents after the operation . Desperate to save both their girls, they sought one last opinion, and were referred to New Delhi, where the chance of both surviving was deemed far greater. The twins were taken to BLK Super Speciality Hospital, and after multiple evaluations their extreme case was identified as them sharing spinal cords, a lower intestinal tract and a urinary tract. Their treatment was split into three stages. Image shows the twins, Hassana (left) and Hussaina (right) and their parents, father Badaru, and mother Malama Badariyya Badaru, with the doctors who carried out the surgery at a press conference . The girls are now recovering from their surgery.

The second - and most crucial - was performed on August 12 with doctors physically separating the twins before plastic surgeons carried out extensive reconstructive procedures. The third stage is due to take place in three weeks’ time and will involve closing the temporary stool passage of both girls. Pygopagus conjoined twins are joined at the posterior - or rump. They account for about 19 per cent of conjoined twins. They usually have separate hearts but share a spinal cord. They also have one anus, two rectums, four arms and four legs.","Twins had fused spines, shared a gastrointestinal passage and genitalia .

A woman who was forced into marriage at the age of 14 while under the control of paedophile Mormon polygamist Warren Jeffs's cult has recounted her harrowing ordeal. The woman, Elissa Wall, revealed how her own mother resorted to holding her daughter's hand at the altar in a bid to calm her down as she was forced to marry her 19-year-old cousin, whom she despised. In a CNN interview, which is to be aired tonight, Elissa describes how she cried so much during the ceremony that her wedding dress was soaked with her own tears. Traumatic: Elissa recalls the harrowing experience of being forced to marry a 19-year-old Warren Jeffs when she was only 14 on the Anderson Cooper CNN TV show . Family portrait: The picture shows dozens of Warren Jeffs's brides, lined up together as if they are posing for a school photograph . She told broadcaster Anderson Cooper: 'It was so devastating that even in the ceremony itself I'm crying to such a level that my wedding dress is soaked. 'They had my mother stand next to me and hold my hand just to get me to take my vows.' Elissa is a former member of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS), a sect led by polygamist paedophile Warren Jeffs. She left the church and divorced her cousin husband, with whom she had no children but endured repeated miscarriages. Jeffs was jailed last month for life after a jury found him guilty of sexually assaulting two FLDS girls - aged 12 and 15 - who he married in FLDS religious ceremonies. Appeal: Warren Jeffs filed a handwritten motion seeking a new trial (file picture) As Jeffs begins his life sentence in a . Texas, former members of the church have come forward to speak about . the appalling abuse carried out within the sect, an extreme splinter group of the Mormon faith which believes in polygamy. In tonight's interview, Elissa lifts . the lid on the appalling abuse suffered by young members of the church - . and the seemingly powerless position of their parents and other adults. 'They had my mother stand next to me and hold my hand just to get me to take my vows' She explained that women - like her mother - were so brainwashed by the church's indoctrination they were unable to protect their own children. When asked by Cooper whether anyone tried to stop the arranged marriage or help her, Elissa said: 'Before my marriage had been commanded, we had been taken away from [my father] and he didn't fight for us. 'We were given to another man's children. My mother was resold to another man, and my mother didn't have the ability to say no. 'The women, especially my mother in the position she was in, they don't have the ability to protect their children. 'I was a representation of that. She couldn't step up and say, ""no, my daughter is 14"". She had been trained and indoctrinated her entire life.' She has written a memoir called Stolen Innocence, which chronicles her ordeal at the hands of the extremist group. Jailed for life: Warren Jeffs, shaven and dishevelled in his booking photograph, was in a coma after starving himself. He will be eligible for parole when he is 100. Wallace Jeffs - the half-brother of Warren - will also appear in tonight's show. Wallace left the church and has three of his daughters living with him - but he is worried about those left behind. He told Cooper: 'I'm very concerned. Very concerned about them getting married underage, being abused. I . believe in the faith, but I don't believe in Warren Jeffs as the . prophet. He's a fraud.' Earlier this month it was revealed that sect leader Jeffs filed a handwritten motion seeking a new trial in Texas following his conviction. Jeffs, who headed the Utah-based . FLDS, has claimed his . religious freedoms were violated by the courts – a defence put forward during his trial. In his motion, the 55-year-old said: 'The . Constitutional protection for religious faith and freedom of practice . not being of full protection in previous trial ... is legal grounds . sufficient to rule in favor of defendant allowed a new trial.' Spiritual home: The temple of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Eldorado, Texas . Scrawled on one page in a lined notebook, Jeffs's self-penned motion was dated August 23 - two weeks after his conviction. Jeffs' filing also seeks a new hearing on the suppression of evidence from a . 2008 raid on the FLDS's Yearning for Zion ranch in Eldorado.

Nottingham Forest striker Darius Henderson intervened in a row between his girlfriend and alleged lover and broke a New Year’s Eve reveller’s cheekbone, a court heard. The 31-year-old was seeing in New Year 2011 with girlfriend Lucy Caplan when Hazel Kent allegedly confronted him at Darcy’s restaurant in St Albans, Hertfordshire. Miss Kent, 48, claimed she and Henderson, who now plays for the Championship team, had recently met for sex - even describing the brand of boxer shorts he wore and the inside of his home. In court: Nottingham Forest striker Darius Henderson (left) is accused of breaking the jaw of John Bell (right) John Bell, 42, who had been dining with his partner John Lavelle and some friends at a nearby table, tried to calm down Henderson but the footballer lashed out, St Albans Crown Court was told. He allegedly punched Mr Bell so hard it fractured his cheekbone and damaged his eye socket. Mr Bell’s injuries were so serious he had to have surgery and now has titanium plates in his face. Henderson - who played for Millwall at the time and has also been at Sheffield United, Watford, Reading and Swindon Town - is on trial charged with grievous bodily harm. Opening the case, prosecutor Alan Richards said: ‘This case concerns an unfortunate incident at the end of a long and generally pleasant night in St Albans. ‘Mr Henderson, who is a professional footballer, was out with his girlfriend Lucy Caplan. They ate together at Darcy’s restaurant, then went through to the bar to see the New Year in. ‘Mr Bell was out with his partner John Lavelle and two female friends. The two groups had little contact with each other... everything was perfectly convivial between them. ‘In fact none of the parties were responsible for sowing the seeds of tension that night. Another person, Hazel Kent, was in the restaurant. ‘For reasons best known to herself, she behaved somewhat unpleasantly to Mr Henderson and Miss Caplan, asserting on more than one occasion, that she had recently had sex with Mr Henderson. ‘She asserted that she could describe Mr Henderson’s home to establish the truth of her assertions - it seems she may have correctly identified that brand of boxer shorts. ‘Understandably this upset Miss Caplan and caused some tension between her and Mr Henderson. Equally understandably Mr Henderson was keen that Miss Kent should leave him and Miss Caplan alone. On the pitch: Henderson scores Forest's winner against Blackburn on the opening day . ‘There is no reason to believe that this was anything other than pure fiction, but Miss Kent persisted.’ Jurors heard Mr Bell tried to step in to calm things down. But then Henderson, of Markyate, Hertforshire, allegedly punched him twice in the head. Mr Richards said: ‘It is possible that his intervention caused Mr Henderson, who was already upset and angered by Miss Kent’s behaviour, to perceive Mr Bell as somehow associated with her. ‘What is absolutely clear, say the . prosecution, is that Mr Bell posed no threat to Mr Henderson whatsoever. Even if his intervention was unwelcome it could not even begin to . justify what he did. '(Darius) Henderson punched Mr (John) Bell in the head twice. It may be the first blow did not connect but the second certainly did and Mr Bell was knocked to the floor' Alan Richards, prosecuting . ‘He punched Mr Bell in the head twice. It may be the first blow did not connect but the second certainly did and Mr Bell was knocked to the floor.’ The attack was captured on the restaurant’s CCTV and 6ft 4in Henderson was arrested at the scene. In the footage Mr Bell was seen chatting to Henderson at the bar after Miss Caplan walked off. Some jurors gasped as they watched the video of Henderson punching Mr Bell twice after appearing to stumble off his seat. In an interview Henderson told police he thought Mr Bell was going to hit him. Mr Richards told a jury of eight men and four women: ‘Mr Henderson’s case was, as it remains, that he perceived Mr Bell to pose a threat to him so he hit first in self-defence. ‘The law does allow for pre-emptive strikes to be launched in self-defence but the prosecution say that is simply not the truth of what happened here. ‘If there can be an explanation of Mr Henderson’s behaviour, the Crown submits it lies in his anger and frustration at what happened earlier in the evening, which was not of Mr Bell’s making. Proud Lion: Henderson in action for his previous club Millwall . ‘Even if that goes someway to explaining why Mr Henderson acted as he did, it cannot and does not excuse it.’ Giving evidence, Mr Bell said he could not remember anything after 11pm. He told jurors: ‘The next thing I remember is being in Watford A&E having a brain scan.’ Prior to that, he said: ‘I remember talking to Lucy outside at about 9pm. I asked her for a cigarette. ‘She said she had hair extensions and . asked if they looked alright. She said she was with her partner, who she . said was an athlete, and showed me a nice bracelet she was given for . Christmas.’ 'Do you recollect a conversation with Mr Henderson in which you suggested Millwall Football Club were s***?' Sean Minihan, defending . 'No, I don’t follow football' John Bell . Henderson’s lawyer Sean Minihan accused Mr Bell of antagonising his client prior to the alleged assault at around 1.30am. He asked: ‘Do you recollect a conversation with Mr Henderson in which you suggested Millwall Football Club were s***?’ ‘No, I don’t follow football,’ Mr Bell answered. He continued: ‘Any recollection of asking Mr Henderson to apologise to a woman and threatening him?’ ‘No,’ Mr Bell said. Mr Minihan asked: ‘Do you know what bottling means? Any recollection of making that threat?’ ‘No,’ Mr Bell replied. Restaurant manager Anna Iwanicka said Miss Kent, 48, was being very loud in the bar area before tearing into Henderson. She said: ‘The way she was speaking I think she wanted to be heard. I don't know what she was saying exactly. Location: Darius Henderson, 31, was seeing in New Year 2011 with girlfriend Lucy Caplan when Hazel Kent allegedly confronted him at Darcy's restaurant in St Albans, Hertfordshire . ‘At some point I saw her approach Mr Darius Henderson and Lucy. She was very possessive and dominating. From what I could see she was going towards him and saying something and then going back. ‘She was drunk and being very unpleasant. I decided to keep an eye on her as she seemed to want to be the centre of attention and cause problems for people.’ 'At some point I saw (Hazel Kent) approach Mr Darius Henderson and Lucy (Caplan).

Leading companies have been summoned for talks in Whitehall with Consumer Affairs Minister Jo Swinson today . Controversial payday loan firms will not be banned from charging sky-high interest rates, despite a promised government crackdown today on sharp practices in the industry. Leading companies have been summoned for talks in Whitehall with Consumer Affairs Minister Jo Swinson today amid mounting  concern that they are driving desperate families to financial ruin. In a toughly-worded intervention yesterday, Miss Swinson said she was determined to curb ‘irresponsible  behaviour which exploits vulnerable  consumers in financial strife’. But, to the dismay of campaigners, Miss Swinson confirmed payday loan firms such as Wonga will not be ordered to cut their interest rates. She cited concerns that people could be forced into borrowing from even  shadier loan sharks.The industry’s many critics insist that the exorbitant interest rates, which can top 5,000 per cent a year, are the root cause of the misery suffered by hundreds of thousands of people taking out payday loans. Last month the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, called for a legal cap on payday lenders and the level of interest they are allowed to charge. And the consumer organisation Which? published a study showing that 1million families a month are forced to take out payday loans in order to get by. It found that almost 400,000  people take out the high interest loans to pay for essentials such as food and fuel. A further 240,000 need the cash to pay existing loans. Almost half said they could not cover their repayments, forcing them deeper into debt as their ‘short-term’ loans are ‘rolled over’, with fresh interest attached. Today’s summit comes just days after the £2billion industry was referred by the Office of Fair Trading to the Competition Commission. It will have the power to ban or limit products. But it will take up to 18 months to report. Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, called for a legal cap on payday lenders and the level of interest they are allowed to charge. The summit will be updated by the OFT, which said some firms’ business models appeared to be based around customers taking out loans which they are forced to roll over because they cannot meet the repayments. This then leaves the customer trapped with that firm because they would struggle to switch to anyone else. Up to half of lenders’ revenues were found by the OFT to come from the extra charges and interest coming from loans being rolled over. The OFT has given the 50 lenders until the end of July to respond to calls for them to clean up their act or face closure. Five have since surrendered their licence, but only 20 have responded to date. Labour MP Stella Creasy said that it is essential to discuss capping interest rates . Last night Labour MP Stella Creasy accused ministers of being too cosy with the industry, and warned it was futile to try and tackle the problem without addressing interest rates. She said: ‘Having a summit about payday lending without talking about capping interest rates is like discussing arson without mentioning matches.’ Mr Welby warned last month: ‘Once you have taken out the loan it is difficult to get out of the cycle. With the rates offered, simply paying off the interest becomes a struggle.’ Miss Swinson said the firms would be challenged today over why they had failed to clean up their act and how they planned to put it right.The minister claimed that capping the crippling interest rates charged by payday lenders might limit the market and drive people to seek even more desperate solutions to their financial problems. She said: ‘Some people say we should just cap the interest rates.But that could shut down short-term loans and force people towards illegal loan sharks or other extreme measures.’ Miss Swinson suggested she would focus on limiting the ease with which loans are ‘rolled over’ – a practice widely blamed for driving people deeper into debt. And she raised concerns about automatic payment systems that allow lenders to raid the bank accounts of clients in order to claw back money they are owed.","Companies summoned for talks with Consumer Affairs Minister Jo Swinson .

Robert Kennedy Jr's true feelings on a number of top New York Democrats have been revealed as more excerpts from his stolen diary were published. The son of the slain former Attorney General wrote that Reverends Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton 'give me the creeps' and that their obvious agendas did a disservice to their political goals. The revelations come on top of his admissions about 'lust demons' that drove him to cheat on his wife Mary, who killed herself last year just days after he filed for divorce. The second batch of excerpts come from The New York Post, and Kennedy put out a statement condemning their publication but confirming that they did in fact come from him. A 2001 diary belonging to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , pictured with late wife Mary, has been unearthed that gives a stunning insight into the number of affairs he carried out during the same year that she gave birth to their fourth child . Activism: The journal dates back to 2001, when Robert was arrested and spent a month in jail in Vieques, Puerto Rico (pictured here in August of that year) 'Creepy': RFK Jr was in jail with Rev. Al Sharpton (left) and the wife of Rev. Jesse Jackson (right), and he wrote disparagingly about the two black civil rights leaders . 'The New York Post has chosen to print . excerpts from a 13-year-old diary illegally stolen from me,' he said in a . statement to the paper. 'The diary served as a tool for self-examination and for dealing with my spiritual struggles at the time. It also contains unedited, unfiltered stream-of-consciousness musings about current events and people.’ Those newsworthy people included a number of politicians from his own party- and even his own family. At the time that the diary was written, Kennedy's sister Kerry was married to Andrew Cuomo when he was the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Focused on their image: Reverends Jesse Jackson (left) and Al Sharpton (right) were subjects of withering criticism from Kennedy as he said that they were in it for themselves . Try try again: Int he journal, Kennedy said his then-brother-in-law Andrew Cuomo would have a problem winning the 2002 election (which he lost) because he 'lacked humanity' Family: At the time the journal was written, Robert's sister Kerry (left, see in 1990) was married to Andrew Cuomo (right), who was then worked in the Department of Housing and Urban Development but was mulling a gubernatorial run . When Andrew came to his then-brother-in-law for advice about a possible gubernatorial run- hoping to follow in his father Mario's footsteps. In the journal, Robert wrote that Cuomo could win due to his energy and focus, but 'he could lose because he lacks humanity and doesn't love people'. Ends up that Robert was right at the time since Cuomo's 2002 bid for governor failed but he went on to win in 2010. That wasn't the only entry where . Kennedy weighed in on the Cuomo family's legal skills, as then-retired . Governor Mario helped try to get Kennedy out of a jail sentence after he . and several other activists were arrested during a demonstration in . Vieques, Puerto Rico. Kennedy was jailed alongside Reverend Al Sharpton and the wife of Jesse Jackson. During . lock up, he apparently had plenty of time to critique his fellow . Democrats, saying that Sharpton 'has done more damage to the black . cause' than segregationist governors in the south who prevented school . integration. '(Sharpton's) transparent venal blackmail and extortion schemes taint all black leadership,' Kennedy wrote. Kennedy spent 30 days in a Puerto Rican jail alongside Rev. Al Sharpton in July 2001 after getting arrested for trespassing at a U.S. Navy training facility. Kennedy, pictured at his wife Mary's graveside last year with their children, writes in his diary about his feelings of guilt and remorse at repeatedly cheating on her . Jackson wasn't spared sharp criticism either, as Kennedy wrote that he had 'a desperate and destructive addiction to publicity'. 'I feel dirty around him, and I feel like I’m being used. I feel like with Jesse, it’s all about Jesse,' he added. The timing of the journal means that it included the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. As a result, he included some withering reviews of the Republican response. He wrote that President George Bush was 'an idiot and a puppet' and New York City's then-mayor Rudy Giuliani was a 'little despot' who was 'desperate' to hold on to his position of power. Robert F. Kennedy Jnr with his late wife Mary Richardson Kennedy, left, in 2008 and, right, with girlfriend Cheryl Hines in 2011. In the journal RFK kept a 'ledger' with a rating system of all the women he slept with . Kennedy wrote that he had his own . power control issues, as he made startling admissions of his own . feelings of guilt and remorse at repeatedly cheating on his wife. ‘I’m . like Adam and live in Eden, and I can have everything but the fruit. But the fruit is all I want,’ he wrote on November  5, 2001. On days when he doesn’t cheat, Kennedy writes ‘victory’ to signify that he resisted sexual temptation. He . even used a section at the back of his diary, headed ‘cash accounts,’ to list the first names of women he had cavorted with and gave each a . mark out of ten.

Along with other Russian sleeper agents, she lived a quiet life in a middle-class neighbourhood. However, the Russian agents, known as illegals because they took civilian jobs instead of operating inside embassies, were being sent tasks from Moscow. Their assignments involved burrowing deep into U.S. society and cultivating contacts with academics, entrepreneurs and government policymakers on subjects from defense to finance. FBI videos of the Russian agents show Chapman and the other illegals surreptitiously passing information and money as part of their operations. The Russian spy ring was exposed by the FBI on June 27, 2010. The pin-up was quickly catapulted into the limelight as her pictures were splashed around the world.

A missing boy's mother has dropped a civil lawsuit against the child's stepmother whom she believes kidnapped him, but she vows to keep searching for her son. Oregon woman Desiree Young filed the $10 million suit against Terri Horman last year, alleging the stepmother kidnapped Kyron Horman, who vanished three years ago when he was seven-year-old. On Tuesday, she dropped the case, saying it couldn't move forward without information the police won't release because of the ongoing criminal investigation into the boy's disappearance. But, in a press conference in Portland, Young begged the court to order Horman to return her son or say where his body is. Scroll down for video . Still fighting: Desiree Young, pictured on Tuesday, announced she has dropped a civil lawsuit against her son's stepmother whom she believes kidnapped him, but she vows to keep searching for her son . Devastated: Kyron Horman was 7 when he disappeared from school in June 2010. No arrests have been made . She said she has never given up hope that he will be found alive. 'Every day you are not here safe in my arms is another day of agonizing torture,' she said. 'I will find you. It's all I want. I will not stop. I will never stop.' Young announced her decision to withdraw the lawsuit Tuesday after a hearing before a Multnomah County judge, according to KGW.com. Kyron Horman disappeared from his Portland school in June 2010. No arrests have been made. Horman hasn't commented on Young's allegation, but the desperate mother urged her again to cooperate on Tuesday. Appealing to the woman directly she said: 'Terry, I cannot tolerate this silence.' She said that Horman continues to stonewall investigators. 'I'm still going to bring pressure on Terri. I'm not going away,' Young said. Prime suspect: Terri Horman, left, the stepmother of Kyron Horman, right, was named the 'prime suspect' by a judge in a civil case last August, which has now been dropped . Gone: Kyron Horman, pictured, disappeared three years ago and Terri Horman was the last person to see him . But she said she knew going after . police records for her civil case could scupper the criminal case, and . she didn't want to hinder that investigation. 'I'm very disappointed that we can't move forward,' she said. 'I don't want anything to compromise the ongoing investigation.'In a criminal case, a key witness has begun cooperating with investigators after initially declining to testify.Young's . attorney said DeDe Spicher has testified before the grand jury. Spicher . was friends with Terri and her whereabouts were in question the day . Kyron vanished. Spicher had previously refused to answer 142 questions related to his disappearance, pleading the Fifth Amendment. Press conference: Young, mother of Kyron Horman, and her attorney Elden Rosenthal announced that the civil case can't move forward without information the police will not release because of the ongoing criminal investigation . The seven-year-old went missing from Skyline School on June 4, 2010, and his stepmom Terri Horman was the last person to see him. Kyron's biological mother Desiree Young - who divorced father Kaine before their son vanished - asked a judge to force Terri's friend to answer all of the questions put to her during a deposition taken in December 2012. DeDe Spicher was uncooperative during questioning - even refusing to identify a picture of her friend, whether she knew her husband and if she had ever met Kyron - in the $10million civil suit filed by Young. Multnomah . County sheriff's investigators looking into the disappearance of Kyron . Horman were interested in the whereabouts of Spicher on that day. Court . documents say she was at work but left abruptly at 11.30 a.m. and . returned 90 minutes later. She declined to say what she did during that . time. 'Are you aware that Kyron Horman has disappeared?' asked Young's lawyer, Elden Rosenthal. 'I'm . asserting my Fifth Amendment right,' Spicher replied, according to a . transcript filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court obtained by The . Oregonian. She even refused . to identify a picture . Last seen: Kyron, pictured at a science fair on the morning of June 4, 2010, aged 7, was last seen by his stepmother walking off to class; this is the last known picture of him . Proceedings: His biological mother, Desiree Young, is pictured in court on August 15, 2012 with her attorney, Elden Rosenthal; Young filed a $10m civil suit against the stepmother . Lawyer . Elden Rosenthal noted that  the Fifth Amendment provides that 'no . person...shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against . himself.' 'Plaintiff . believes that Ms Spicher has inappropriately sought the protection of . the privilege against self-incrimination,' he wrote. 'The privilege is . personal; it cannot be used to protect another person...Otherwise, the . privilege could be used as a shield to protect a witness' friends, and . to deny a civil litigant probative evidence. 'A witness may not invoke the Fifth Amendment in order to hide knowledge of a friend's criminal conduct.' After Kyron disappeared, authorities searched the condo Spicher was working at on June 4. In . 2010, investigators also put out a flier with Spicher's photos on it, . asking if anyone noticed her or Terri Horman between 9:45 a.m. and 1 . p.m. on June 4, 2010. The suit Ms Young filed asks the judge to order Horman to return Kyron or, if he is dead, reveal where his remains are located. In his ruling, Judge Kantor wrote: 'Witnesses and evidence may disappear. Memories may fade. The opportunity to find Kyron alive or dead, lessens.' Ms Young accused Horman of knowing what happened to Kyron. She told the East Idaho News in June: 'I believe that Terri Horman knows where Kyron is. I believe that Terri Horman is responsible for where my son is.' According to NWCN.com, Horman was the last to see Kyron alive. Ms Young’s civil suit accuses her of kidnapping him from Skyline Elementary. Following Judge Kantor's decision, the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office released a statement that stated the civil case was separate from the continuing criminal investigation against Horman. No stone unturned: Authorities have searched more than 28,000 hours for Kyron since his 2010 disappearance; here, recovery workers take to the water . Three if by sea: Three rescue workers from the Tualtin Valley Water Rescue Unit posed for a picture ahead of a rescue mission . A mother's grief: Young is seen speaking with reporters after filing the lawsuit against Kyron's stepmother on June 1 of last year . The statement read: 'While there may be rulings regarding the court's opinions as to how the case may proceed, these rulings/legal opinions are part of the civil court case. The civil case is a process that is independent of the active, on-going criminal investigation being conducted by the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office. Investigators have long focused on Horman, although until this point, had not named her as a suspect or filed criminal charges. When the lawsuit was filed on June 1, Young's attorney, Elden Rosenthal, said it would be on a 'parallel track' with the criminal investigation. He would not say what kind of reaction the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office gave when he informed them of Young's decision to sue. Horman believes the suit is working to advance the aims of local law enforcement. She points out that the judge hearing her divorce from Kyron's father, Kaine Horman, delayed that case while the criminal investigation plays out. 'Plainly and simply, Young's lawsuit is a quest for information to move the criminal investigation forward and to taint any jury pool,' according to the filing. Civil allegations require a lower standard of proof — a preponderance of evidence — than criminal charges, which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Compelling her to testify, Bunch wrote, could force Terri Horman to invoke her constitutional right against self-incrimination, pointing out the weak spots in her case. Happier times: Young smiles and holds her son on the beach . Playtime: A family photo shows a smiling Kyron enjoying the playground . 'The burden on Horman of being required to participate in this lawsuit before the district attorney and police have completed their investigation squarely jeopardizes her constitutional rights,' Bunch wrote. 'We've racked our brains trying to think . of reasons why. We cannot come up with anything. It’s like a portal . opened up in the school and Kyron just vanished into it.' -Biological mother Desiree Young . According to local news reports at . the time of his disappearance, Horman took her stepson to a science fair . at the school that Friday morning. Initial sheriff’s reports said that Horman saw Kyron walking off to his classroom, and judging that he was on his way, left. The teacher of Kyron’s class didn’t see him at the 10am start, and marked him absent. His parents were alarmed when Kyron didn’t get off the school bus that afternoon, and called the school. Skyline, in turn, called 911 to report the boy missing. According to East Idaho News, the police department has spent a collective 28,000 hours searching for him. Progression: A composite by Missing & Exploited imagines what Kyron could look like today, aged 9 . Horman's former husband Kyron Horman first filed a restraining order against her and later divorced her. They have a young toddler together. Ms Young told Good Morning America in a 2010 interview that her son's disappearance was 'a parent's worst nightmare.' She said: 'We've racked our brains trying to think of reasons why. We cannot come up with anything. It's like a portal opened up in the school and Kyron just vanished into it.

Pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline has sold popular soft drinks brands Lucozade and Ribena to Orangina and Schweppes owner Suntory Beverage & Food for £1.35billion, it was announced today. Glaxo is selling the historic brands to Japanese drinks group Suntory after putting them up for sale earlier this year. Lucozade and Ribena, which date back to 1927 and the 1930s respectively, are made in the UK at a factory in Coleford, Gloucestershire, which employs around 500 staff. Scroll down for video .

England and Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard is one of many sports stars that put his face to the diversified version of Lucozade: Lucozade Sport. This is his 2005 advert . Lucozade created a Lara Croft version of the brand to coincide with the Tomb Raider movie in 2001 . The drugs company kicked off their sale in April after concluding they would grow better under a different owner. Investors, however, reacted badly to the news with Glaxo shares lower by 2.5p to 1,648.5p.Glaxo . plans to focus on its consumer healthcare business, which includes . brands such as Sensodyne, Panadol, Aquafresh and Niquitin. Lucozade is the UK's top-selling energy and sports drink, while blackcurrant drink Ribena is the fourth-best selling fruit juice and concentrate. The two drinks brands achieved combined sales of £600million last year but three quarters of sales were in the UK, while they have virtually no presence in emerging markets where Glaxo sees its future growth potential. Glaxo chief strategy officer David Redfern said Lucozade and Ribena have made a huge contribution over the years, and their future is in ‘good hands’. He said: ‘Now is the right time to sell them as we increase the focus of our consumer healthcare business and execute the delivery of our late stage pipeline of pharmaceuticals and vaccines.’ Glaxo said the ‘vast majority’ of staff at Coleford and working in commercial, research and development will transfer to Suntory. Glaxo will continue to make and distribute the drinks in Nigeria under licence from Suntory. The drinks were owned by Beecham prior to its merger with Glaxo 13 years ago, and more than three-quarters of their sales are in the UK. Suntory, which bought Orangina in 2009 for £2.2billion, said the brands will help it grow faster in the UK and expand to become the leading global soft drink company by 2020. It debuted on the stock market earlier this year with a float that raised £2.6billion. The cash deal is expected to complete by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approval.Suntory Beverage & Food, which is part of the £12billion turnover Suntory Group, said the drinks' sales networks will help it grow its other brands in countries such as Nigerian and Malaysia. The sale also prevents what could have turned into an auction for the brands which are said to have attracted considerable interest from private equity groups including CVC Capital Partners and KKR, and were also reportedly in the sights of Irn-Bru owner AG Barr. In the three months to the end of June, Lucozade sales grew 4 per cent but Ribena was down 2 per cent. 'Glucozade' was first brewed in 1927 by William Owen, a chemist in Newcastle. It was Mr Owen's answer to tiredness for people suffering from the flu or a common cold. By 1929, then renamed Lucozade, it was stocked in most British hospitals. A great success, the fizzy orange drink caught the eye of soft drink magnate Beechams - which would become GlaxoSmithKline - in 1938. By the early 1950s, they would rely on Lucozade to bring in half their profits. Until 1982, it was sold in a glass bottle with yellow cellophane wrapping. But in 1983, renamed and reformed management GlaxoSmithKline gave the beverage a makeover. The slogan changed from 'Lucozade aids recovery' to 'Lucozade replaces lost energy' - with a plastic bottle brought in instead. With Olympic decathlete Daley Thompson as the face and a range of new flavours, it became the brand success story of the 1980s. In 1990, Lucozade Sport was launched, with stars such as Liverpool's John Barnes, Alan Shearer and rugby national Jonny Wilkinson heading up their various advertising campaigns. Their novelty editions include 'Larazade' in 2001, fashioned to coincide with the film Tomb Raider - taking its name from Angelina Jolie's character Lara Croft. Since its launch, Lucozade remains the leading brand in the energy drinks category. Invented in 1938 as a pure fruit syrup, Dr Vernon Charley was trying to find something to add to his milkshake. The name 'Ribena' comes from 'Ribes nigrum' - the botanical name for blackcurrant - meant to reflect the natural content, rich in Vitamin C. During World War Two, other Vitamin C sources like oranges, made in America, were difficult to get hold of. The government encouraged growth of blackcurrants and the manufacture of this new sweet cordial, delivered to children's homes for free - at first without the brand name. After a steady rise in popularity, then-owners Carters were bought out by GlaxoSmithKline in 1955. The first television advert sent sales soaring. Like Lucozade, the soft drinks organisation diversified the range and pumped advertising. In the 1980s, the 'Ribena Berries' - friendly blackcurrant-shaped characters - were created. Canned 'Sparkling Ribena' hit shelves in the 1980s, replaced by 'Ribena Spring' in 1993, which was changed to 'Ribena Spark' a few years later. Other versions have included raspberry, strawberry and peach flavours. Issues have arisen over the stated level of Vitamin C content and number of berries used. The suggestion that '95 per cent of British berries' are used to produce the drink came under fire in the 1990s. Their branding now states that 'most' berries are used.","New owner Suntory already owns Orangina and Schweppes .

A police report . stated that the 37-year-old was 'rambling about God' and 'eating dirt.’ Williams . was charged with a count of misdemeanor obstruction. According to the . lawsuit, in the course of his brief stay at Owasso Police Headquarters, . the mentally disturbed man was observed crawling on his hands and knees, . barking and repeatedly slamming his head into the wall. Williams . was left in a holding cell for more than 10 hours, during which time he . defecated on himself. He was then placed in a shower 'feet first, on . his back,' and the water was left running for up to two hours. Scroll down for jail video . Beginning of the end: Williams was placed in a medical cell at the Tulsa County Jail on October 25, 2011 . Bad treatment: A jail staffer was captured on video tossing trays of food into the man's cell . A short time later, the suspect was transferred to Tulsa County Jail. During the booking process, Williams allegedly complained about being unable to walk and begged police to 'cut it out of my belly,' the TV station KTUL reported. After being examined by a psychiatrist, Williams was moved into a so-called 'suicide cell.' A video camera installed inside the room captured the man lying immobile on his back with just a blanket covering his naked body. The 10-minute, 23-second footage released this week as part of the on-going litigation shows jailhouse staffers throwing trays of food into the cell. Throughout his stay in the medical cell, Williams was visited by a number of officials, who are seen on surveillance video examining him from afar while carefully trying to avoid touching him. Check-up: A jailhouse official stopped by Williams' cell just long enough to cover his exposed genitals with the blanket . Too little, too late: It was not until two days later that staffers noticed that something was wrong with the 37-year-old man . At one point, a man in a suit jacket could be seen lifting a corner of the blanket to cover Williams' genitals as he lies motionless and unresponsive. The disturbing video shows Williams not moving beyond reaching for a cup of water, dipping his fingers in it and bringing them to his mouth. The packaged meals scattered around the room remained untouched. Later in the recording, staffers walk into the cell and discover that Williams is in medical distress. Employees of Correctional Healthcare Management of Oklahoma Inc. then make several attempts to revive Williams by administering CPR, but to no avail. Futile attempt: A team of medics attempted to revive Williams, but they did not succeed . Cause of death: A medical examiner determined that Williams died from spinal injuries caused by blunt force trauma . The state Medical Examiner's Office later determined that Williams died from spinal injuries caused by blunt force trauma, Tulsa World reported. Following the release of the jail cell footage, the county's Board of Commissioners voted to seek requests for bids for health care services at the jail. Correctional Healthcare Management of Oklahoma Inc. or its affiliates have been the penitentiary's medical care provider since July 2005. Last year alone, the company was paid $5.2million for its services. A county official, however, insisted that the decision to seek proposals from other health care providers was in no way related to the lawsuit over Williams' death.","Elliott Earl Williams, 37, died October 27, 2011, while in Tulsa County Jail .

After a whirlwind week, the Jeannette couple tied the knot in a hastily arranged backyard ceremony that formalized their union and celebrated Logan's life, which doctors say will be cut short soon by cancer.

My husband saw me and to my surprise (and horror) started dropping hints that he'd like to try some of the things in the book. For me, such fantasies should remain in the mind. How do I tell him without seeming like a spoilsport? Black and white answer: Despite Fifty Shades of Grey's popularity, most of its female fans aren't desperate for bondage; women often aren't taken in by sex 'trends' Answer: I sometimes worry that the furore around Fifty Shades Of Grey and racy reads like it has made many over-excited partners forget the boundaries between fact and fantasy. When I was young, every woman was reading Shirley Conran's Lace books, but no one thought we all longed to be soft porn stars like the heroine Lili. Nor did anyone suspect the vast global readership of Colleen McCullough's The Thorn Birds was actually panting after Roman Catholic priests. So why does everyone think the popularity of Fifty Shades means its female fans are all desperate for light bondage? Most women know their own erotic tastes and aren't taken in by 'trends'. There's nothing new about S&M (just ask the Marquis de Sade) and most of us decided it wasn't our cup of tea decades ago. The funny thing is that bondage isn't Fifty Shades's heroine Anastasia Steele's peccadillo either - she just complies for her lover Christian Grey. So far, so old fashioned. My sense of things is that the truly aphrodisiacal quality of billionaire Grey is not his penchant for inflicting pain, but his money, power, helicopter and boyish good looks. Take all that away and no woman I know would acquiesce to his games. So I don't think for a second you're a 'spoilsport' for not wanting to go along with your husband's desires. While some people welcome the chance to be submissive (it can be a relief to cede control in one area of your life), most prefer power to be evenly shared in the bedroom. Apart from anything else, this type of lovemaking means you can't caress or hold your beloved, which takes away half the point for many people. It's also hard to adopt a whole new sexual persona when you've been making love to the same person for two or three decades. What works in your imagination may well become ridiculous or unwelcome in real life. I wonder how much your husband really wants to re-enact Fifty Shades (has he even read it?) or if his request is really motivated by the desire to try something new to revitalise your sex life. Why don't you sit your spouse down and tell him you prefer your pleasure unadulterated by pain, but are more than happy to try gentle experimentation. Something as simple as the use of a silk scarf as a blindfold can add a whole new sensual dimension to your erotic life. It always seems to me that any measure that prevents two long-term lovers from catching eyes and bursting out laughing is a good idea. The Great British sense of humour can prove detrimental in the bedroom. The main thing is that you find a compromise together. Sometimes it's gracious not to issue an outraged 'No!' to your partner when you can find a way of changing the terms of the question.","Fifty Shades of Grey was incredibly popular .

Angela Ahrendts, the high-flying chief executive of Burberry, said: ‘It is one of the most important parts of my job showing that you can’t do it all.’ The 53-year-old laid bare the compromises she makes to balance her job with her home life with three teenage children. She described herself as having ‘three jobs’, as a wife, mother and chief executive of the fashion label. On . most days, Mrs Ahrendts gets up – without an alarm clock – at 4.35am. She insists that she gets a headache if she sleeps for more than six . hours. It is, she said, ‘my inspirational time, my time to find peace, . to watch the sun rise’, which makes her into ‘a better executive every . morning, calmer and nicer’. She . added that she regularly declines sought-after invitations, such as the . opportunity to go to the Oscars ceremony, because family is more . important. Mrs Ahrendts, who . is married to her childhood sweetheart, Gregg, tries to limit herself . to one night out a week, and also to make sure that she is home by . Friday night when she is travelling.

Three holidaymakers were escorted out of a Nashville hotel by an armed guard after they threatened to give the business a bad review on TripAdvisor. The three friends had booked and pre-paid for two rooms at the Knights Inn on Spring Street, Nashville, America. But they were left stunned when the hotel receptionist said they could not access to the rooms because the fourth member of their party who had paid for the rooms on his credit card wasn't present. The situation escalated when the jet-lagged guests, who had landed in America just hours earlier, mentioned giving bad feedback on travel website TripAdvisor and were escorted out of the hotel under armed guard. Holidaymakers, pictured from left to right, John Howard, Lee Wilkinson, Alan Lloyd and Nick Cobban were refused entry to their pre-paid hotel rooms because one of them wasn't present . Alan Lloyd, 69, from London, said: 'He said he would not now rent us any rooms, and we had to leave. 'At that point he summoned an armed guard who stood with his hand on his gun as we picked up our suitcases and returned to the Ford Escape we had hired.' Mr Lloyd and his travel-weary party were left stranded and were forced to drive to four neighbouring hotels in the early hours of the morning before finding a place to stay for the night. John Howard, 67, from Leigh-on-Sea, said: 'It was an insane situation. 'He had empty rooms, two rooms had been paid for in advance, and yet here we were, completely tired out and road weary, and we could not get in.' The hotel receptionist had claimed he needed the fourth member of the party - who had booked the rooms on credit card - to be in attendance to allow access to the rooms. But Lee Wilkinson, 62, from East London, had already arrived at the hotel earlier that day and was awaiting his friends’ arrival in a room upstairs with no mobile network signal to contact them. Removed: The group were then escorted out of the Knights Inn on Spring Street, Nashville, USA, after threatening to leave a bad review on TripAdvisor . Unhappy customers: Lee Wilkinson, back left, and John Howard, back right, Nick Wilkinson, front left, and Alan Lloyd, front right, were stunned by the incident . Mr Wilkinson said: 'I wondered what had happened to the others, whether they had missed their flights or what. 'I didn’t dream they were in the reception area waiting for me. 'A simple phone call to my room by the desk clerk would have solved the problem, which was completely unnecessary.' The hotel boss later apologised for the error and offered the tourists a discounted stay. Hotel manager, James Patel, added: 'I have reprimanded the member of staff involved and explained that although he should follow the rules, he needs to be flexible.' Travellers who have posted derogatory reviews on travel site Trip Advisor have become accustomed to receiving a swift retort from manager Mr Patel in the comments section of the website. Outspoken: The Knights Inn manager James Patel responds to most of the bad reviews about his hotel left on the website TripAdvisor . Apology: Knights Inn manager Mr Patel apologised for the incident and said the staff member had been reprimanded . One reviewer - who left a one star . review on the website - was met with the reply: 'We apologise that we . didn’t meet your expectations. 'You . were looking for Hilton standards and ambiance. The rate at the Hilton . downtown was $350 per night plus tax, parking $40 per night, breakfast . to be paid by guest and charge for wifi, refrigerator and microwave. 'You paid us $40 for the night with all the above listed things included in your price.' Speaking . about his nightmare stay in Nashville, Mr Howard added: 'This sort of . incident reflects badly not only on Nashville, but the whole US tourist . industry. 'It will make European tourists think twice about visiting America. 'Armed . hotel guards are unheard of in Europe, and it is flabbergasting that . they could be turned on hotel guests who have pre-paid for their rooms.' 'Have not stayed at this hotel, but have just experienced the worst customer service possible. I rang hotel requesting to be put through to room of guest, with an urgent family message, to be told that due to security reasons it was not hotel policy to do so. I then asked that they relay message to guest, to be told that they have 100 rooms and do not know what room guest is staying in??!! Yes, I can accept that hotels have rules but to not know what room is assigned to what guest seems highly unlikely. Laziness and a don't care attitude by the staff member is what it appears to be.' The manager's response: . 'When you called the hotel the desk clerk transferred your call to the room of the guest you wanted to talk to. The guests were not in the room. The desk clerk asked you to leave a message on their message system on the phone in the room. You became irate and told the desk clerk that he should find the guests wherever they are and that he should give you the room number the guests were staying in.the guest is the only person who can give you the room number For security reasons we are unable to give room number of guest to anybody. We cater to hundreds of guests regularly and have always transferred calls and taken messages appropriately.' 'I completely understand that you get what you pay for, but this hotel is a joke. Our room was filthy, there was hair in the sheets and all over the bathrooms and it just did not smell clean. It looked like they just dumped furniture in a room and left. When I checked out I told the man at the front desk (who felt horrible, obviousl) and told me he couldn't really do anything about a reimbursement because I paid through hotels.com. He did however give me $15 cash for breakfast because he felt bad. And probably so I wouldn't write a bad review. So I called hotels.com and I was able to receive a 50% reimbursement that was handled instantly. So I really only spent about $12 on the room, but I would have rather spent full price on a room and location we were satisfied with.' The manager's response: . 'You had wanted a refund on the room after staying at the hotel as you were running low on funds.We have many satisfied guests that stay at our hotel because of clean rooms and great price.The reviews are all written by guests who have stayed at the hotel and are satisfied by their nice experience.You did not want to pay $300 plus tax at the embassy suites on 21st avenue where parking is $35 per day .The desk clerk asked you why you did not mention about your misgivings earlier and stayed the whole night wanting a free night.'","The group had pre-paid for two rooms at the Knights Inn in Nashville .

Two experienced outdoorsman have been declared dead after they disappeared during a week-long camping trip in the rural Canadian wilderness. Police have announced that 40-year-old Matt Zellen and his 71-year-old father Earl are now presumed dead as they have been missing for a week. Investigators seem convinced that they have died, even though there was no sign of foul play, the weather conditions were non-threatening around the time they disappeared, and their bodies have never been found. Missing: Earl Zellen, 71, was an avid outdoorsman and was on a week-long trip with his grown son . Close: Relatives say that Matt Zellen took the trip with his father because he felt it important to do so as long as he was physically able to travel and fish . Remote: The formal investigation into Matt and Earl Zellen's disappearance came when they did not show up in time for their scheduled flight back to Detroit on July 29 . According to The Detroit Free Press, the father-son duo had been camping in the Canadian forest last year, and Matt was joined by his two bothers to celebrate their father's 70th birthday. When Matt, who has twin 3-year-olds, and Earl returned to the Dubawnt Lake area of Nunavut on July 21 of this year, they decided that they did not need a guide, but that did not raise any flags as it was a standard move of many experienced adventurers. 'Pursuant to their request, the men were not accompanied by a guide or a third party at the time they went missing,' Curt Enns, the owner of the Tukto Lodge where the Zellens were staying, said in a statement. ‘As a result, there were no witnesses able to assist in search efforts that occurred over the course of the next three days.’ Family favorite: Matt and Earl were staying at the Tokto Lodge when they disappeared, and it was their second time visiting the area as they went last year with Earl's two other sons for his 70th birthday last year (pictured) The Royal Canadian Mounted Police only became concerned about the men when they did not show up for their flight back to Detroit on July 29. Mr Enns said that staff on the grounds last saw the pair earlier that same day when they were fishing close to the lodge. Staff at the Lodge, which is known for its trout fishing selection, would not respond to further questions from MailOnline. Investigators found the boat that the Zellens had been using washed onto shore eight miles down the river from where they had been staying. The men's life preservers were found inside the boat, which their family explained to The Detroit Free Press as being understandable since experienced fisherman use preservers as cushions while they are fishing for long periods of time. Congenial: Matt previously posted pictures of his father playing with his children and other relatives . Missed: Matt is the father of twin 3-year-olds Walker (left) and Addison (right) Adding to the mystery, the weather conditions did not prove any cause for concern for investigators and the Zellen family as Matt's brother and Earl's son Mike said that it was '72 degrees and sunny' when they went missing. The Mounties carried out a two day manhunt- in addition to the three-day search operated by the Lodge owners- that included ground and air searches, but have since called it off and left their case as an open missing persons file. 'The wilderness got them,' Paul Kotelewetz, the operator of the aviation company that the RCMP used to conduct the search. Relatives of the missing men tried to dispel any questions about the nature of their relationship, saying that they were very close and that Matt felt it important to continue their adventurous trips as long as his father was physically able to do so. ‘They had a wonderful relationship. Their lives were intertwined,' Mike Zellen told The Detroit Free Press. ‘For my dad, everything stemmed from a love of family. His greatest passion were his grandchilden and sons.’","Matt Zellen, 40, was traveling with his 71-year-old father Earl when they disappeared and were last seen on July 29 .

Anthony Weiner's sexting mate Sydney Leathers has revealed her ten point plan for other loose women who might wish to follow her lead and seduce a lusty politician . Leathers' guide has appeared on xojane.com, the controversial and provocative women’s lifestyle website described as ‘where women go when they are being selfish, and where their selfishness is applauded.’ Much of her unlikely advice reads like a list of lazy clichés for how one might go about seducing a powerful man - consisting of ego massage, coyness and more ego massaging – but considering what Anthony Weiner has previously revealed about himself, every word may well be true. Her number one advice for snaring a politician is to ‘indulge his crazy alter-ego, and whatever you do, don't laugh at him.’ Leathers writes that politicians require a lot of attention, needing to be ‘coddled like a baby’ and so she says you must be prepared to be there for them at any time of day or night. In her ten point plant for seducing a politician, Leathers paints a picture of Weiner as a deeply insecure and incredibly vain man who was constant looking for reassurance, much like a small child . Leathers is refusing to bow out of the public spotlight, much to the chagrin of New York mayoral hopeful Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin . ‘Basically, pretend like you're dating the middle school version of yourself. Like the prepubescent horny teenage girl with all these emotions,’ she writes, while noting that keeping a straight face is also extremely important. She reveals that Weiner thanked her every time she helped him have an orgasm and that his incessant use of the word ‘baby’ when addressing her was ‘too much.’ Another of her golden rules is: ‘Find a horny non-politician to finance all the expensive shoes and lingerie pics you're sexting your politician boyfriend.’ According to Leather a relationship with a politician is all about excitement and fun but she also recommends having someone else on the go to provide security and help finance your politician sexting. ‘With a politician, you have to remember: You're probably not going to get money. You're in it for the thrill of it,’ she writes. She reveals that at the same time as her affair with Weiner, she had a ‘bored, rich man’ sending her money in return for ‘selfies’ - sexy pictures of herself in provocative positions and langurie. Another lesson from this sexting master is: ‘Figure out his weaknesses early on. If he's insecure, you've hit gold. Then torture him by playing hard to get.’ In order to gain the upper hand in a game of control with any politician, Leathers recommends never responding to anything immediately and often waiting up to two days before replying. This technique ensured that Weiner remained interested in her, but she also confesses that she ended up planning her days around him because they talked and sexted so regularly. ‘Pathetic, but at least he never knew that,’ she writes. Leathers has revealed that Weiner would ask her to rate photos of him and be specific about how sexy he looked . Her next piece of advice is ‘Be a little coy first. Don't be so aggressive.’ She . reveals that when Weiner first flirted with her she would pretend she . didn’t know what was going on which only encouraged him more. ‘That just makes them 10 times more interested. It's a little trick,’ she writes. But then with her next golden rule, Leathers appears to contradict herself: ‘Give him more attention than he's ever known from a woman. Tell him he is sexy, and be specific about why he is.’ It’s hardly a revelation but Leathers writes that ‘politicians are the biggest attention whores you will ever meet.’ Leathers has revealed that Weiner used to regularly trash talk current New York major Michael Bloomberg . She also gives an interesting insight . into Weiner’s ego when she reveals that he would ask her to be specific . about how sexy he was and would ask her to rate photos of him. ‘He would really want to know which rant on the house floor was the sexiest. What turned me on the most.,’ she writes. According to Leathers as playing coy you also have to sometimes ‘play along with whatever he wants’ in order to drive him wild. ‘With Anthony, I said whatever he wanted to hear, and I took a ton of pictures. We talked on the phone all the time. I gave him as much attention as he wanted. It was like a drug for him,’ she writes. She even referenced an example of sexting between the pair: . Dangr33: I was reading your tweets and looking at your pics. so I thought i'd hold your wrists to settle you down. Sydney: ...you have no idea how turned on I am right now. I really want you to manhandle me. Leathers revealed that Weiner used to regularly trash talk about New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and told her that he was an 'effing loser' Leathers, busy attempting to keep her 15 minutes of infamy going as long as she possibly can, told Gawker in a separate interview that she would endorse his Weiner's penis for mayor before she would endorse the man himself. She also revealed that Weiner regularly trash talked current New York mayor Michael Bloomberg to her. Leathers said that her former sexting partner described Bloomberg as 'effing loser' who 'had to buy his third term.' He also told her that while people hated Bloomberg, they loved him. Leather said that was 'the typical narcissistic type of statement you’d hear from him.' In the same interview she also confirmed that she had used sugar daddy websites to flirt . with older men in the past, she described it as ‘no big . deal’ and just a phase when she was younger.","Anthony Weiner's sexting mate has revealed her ten point plan for women who want to seduce a lusty politician .

A stripper is accused of luring her fiance to an apartment where her then-17-year-old son and his friend tried to kill him by strangling him with an extension cord and bashing him over the head with a fry pan. Vicky Miller, 44, is on trial for the November 2011 attempted murder of Paul Key, 54, whom she met while dancing topless at Lipstick Cabaret in Dallas and agreed to marry after just 30 minutes. Prosecutors on Monday said Key drained his 401k and took out a mortgage on his home so he could lavish Miller, who faces unrelated charges of aggravated sexual assault of a 13-year-old boy, with gifts including a car each for her and her son. 'I agreed to support her financially,' Key testified, adding that he spent cash he'd saved over 30 years on the woman. 'I had someone I enjoyed talking with. I thought I could buy loyalty with money.' He said they regularly met up for breakfast at IHOP following their night shifts and he paid her $2,000 a month to support her so she would quit her job at Lipstick Cabaret. But the affair, which Key claimed on Tuesday was non-sexual, turned sour after Miller kept putting off the wedding and after three and a half years Key, an AT&T employee, began to think he was being used, Dallasnews.com reported. He said he decided to break up with her and move forward with his life. Key, who had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic at age 35, said on Tuesday he had stopped taking his medication about two months before the breakup because he was strapped for cash. But he said that had no impact on his ability to remember the alleged attempted murder, which he claimed may have been prompted by the inaccurate belief that Miller would receive his life insurance payout. Accomplice: Miller's son Francisco James Hurtado and his friend Dunkan Boyce, right, allegedly helped to kill Paul Key . Scene: The alleged attempted murder took place at Miller's apartment, pictured, in Dallas . On November 21, 2011, Miller picked . up Key at his home and brought him to her apartment so he could pick up . her belongings, court documents reveal. When he had done so he sat down . on the couch. That's when he claims someone yanked an extension cord over his head and around his neck trying to strangle him. Miller's son, Francisco Hurtado, who is now 19, allegedly then placed a pillow over his head and tried to suffocate the man before his friend, Dunkan Boyce, struck him over the head several times with a pan, police said. As the extension cord began to cut off his air supply, Key testified on Tuesday that his 'initial inclination was to sit back and observe what it's like to die.' But then he said 'I decided to fight back.' Key managed to escape the boys' clutches and ran outside screaming for help, finally convincing someone at a nearby Dollar General Store to call 911. Meanwhile, the teens decided to make it look like Key attacked Miller and rearranged the apartment. Lipstick Cabaret: Paul Key said he met Vicky Miller at Lipstick Cabaret, pictured, in Dallas . Miller also allegedly asked her son to throw her against a wall, hit her and kick her so she looked beat up. The . son's friend, Boyce, then calls 911 to report the false assault, but . can be heard on the call shouting at the others to hurry up. When police arrive, Key was initially arrested by reporting officers but after further investigation, Miller and the two teens were arrested. On Monday, defense attorney Robbie McClung told jurors not to judge Miller by her former profession. 'There's not just reasonable doubt,' McClung said. 'There are misperceptions and innuendo that don't make any sense because Vicky Miller is not guilty.' Trial dates have not yet been set for the teens, though they are listed as potential witnesses in Miller's trial. If convicted of the second-degree felony, Miller faces two to 20 years in prison.","Vicky Miller, 44, is on trial for the 2011 attempted murder of Paul Key .

"By . Martin Robinson . UPDATED: . 12:54 EST, 21 October 2011 . An ancient spear lodged in a mastodon has proved humans populated North America 1,000 years earlier than previously thought, it was claimed today. Scientists have now accurately carbon-dated the sharp tip, itself carved from mastodon bone, 30 years after it was found in the U.S. state of Washington. It was embedded in a rib from one of the creatures, a giant relative of the elephant and woolly mammoth, and after a long wait experts have said that the bone and spear point are both around 13,800 years old. Breakthrough: This picture shows the rib fragment with the embedded spear, which proves that human hunters populated North America 1,000 years earlier than previously thought . They managed to set this date by analysing collagen protein from the rib and DNA from the same bone and the spear. Previously the first indications of mastodon hunting were associated with the 'Clovis culture' which emerged some 1,000 years later. The Clovis people were believed to be the first to colonise North America after emigrating from Asia, and are said to be the ancestors of all present day Native American tribes. Study: The position of the ribs from the Mastodon's skeleton are marked on this diagram, one of which was pierced by a spear . Their thirst for hunting is blamed by some experts for the sudden disappearance of mammoths, mastodons and other large 'megafauna' mammals from the continent. But it appears there were other humans doing the same thing hundreds of years earlier. Professor Eske Willerslev, from the University of Copenhagen in . Denmark, who led the research, said: 'It is . proof that humans have been present in north America for longer . than previously believed. 'The 'Clovis First' theory, which many scientists swore to just a few . years back, has finally been buried with the conclusions of this study. The rib from various angles: A) Closeup view. (B) Reconstruction showing the bone point with the broken tip. The thin layer represents the exterior of the rib. (C) CT X-ray showing the long shaft of the point from the exterior to the interior of the rib. (D) The entire rib fragment with the embedded bone projectile point . 'Our research now shows that other hunters were present at least . 1,000 years prior to the Clovis culture. Therefore, it was not a sudden . war or a quick slaughtering of the mastodons by the Clovis culture, . which made the species disappear. 'We can now conclude that the hunt for the animals stretched out over . a much longer period of time. At this time, however, we do not know if . it was the man-made hunt for the mastodons, mammoths and other large . animals from the so-called megafauna, which caused them to become . extinct and disappear. 'Maybe the reason was something completely different, for instance the climate.' The rib containing the spear point was part of a collection of mastodon remains unearthed in the late 1970s. Image: An artist's impression of what a mastodon would have looked like, based on the skeletons found across the world . Giant: How the 10ft tall mastodon may have looked next to a comparatively tall 6ft man . Since then experts have argued over its age. The new research, reported in the journal Science, used cutting edge technology to date carbon samples from the bone, the spearpoint and a pair of tusks from the same fossil site. Scientists also carried out CT X-ray scans to visualise the hidden part of the spear tip embedded in the bone. The point was found to be at least 27 centimetres long, comparable to the length of later Clovis-age weapon heads.

Tragic: Lorraine Douglas, 51, suffered a severe head injury in a fall at home which left her on a life-support machine . A family suffered the heartbreak of having to say goodbye to a mother every day for 20 days after she lived for three weeks after her life-support machine was turned off. Lorraine Douglas, 51, had suffered a severe brain injury after falling down the stairs at home, from which she could never recover. After spending two days in intensive care, doctors informed the family they could do nothing more for Ms Douglas. The family made the decision to turn off her life-support machine and prepared to say their goodbyes. But she survived for a further three weeks, causing agony for her family who stayed at her bedside as they expected her to pass away at any moment. Her daughter Leeanne, 22, said: 'I must have said my last goodbye to my mum a hundred times during those three weeks. 'I was constantly saying goodbye, thinking every time I did would be the last chance I got to say it to her. 'Our lives stopped for three weeks. But at least we got to say all the things to Mum that we wanted to before she went.' There was even a moment when Ms Douglas opened her eyes, giving her family false hope she might recover. Her brother Brain Keddie, 48, said: 'It was horrendous. We had said our final goodbyes, we had prepared to let Lorraine go, and then nothing happened. 'She lay there for three more weeks, with us three at her side, knowing there was nothing we could do for her. 'There were some point when we thought maybe, just maybe she’ll get . better. But I think we all really knew the truth. It was unbearable.' Heartbreaking: When doctors told Ms Douglas's family she would never recover they made the difficult decision to switch off her life support . Ms Douglas, a childcare worker, had been found unconscious by her daughter at her home in Wellhouse, Glasgow, who had looked through the letterbox and seen her lying at the bottom of the stairs. She said: 'I couldn’t unlock the front door, as Mum’s keys were in the lock. So I phoned her mobile and could hear it ringing on the other side of the door. 'I looked through the letterbox and saw her lying there at the bottom of . the stairs. Her dog Archie was sitting at her side. It was awful.' She phoned the emergency services who took her mother to Glasgow Royal Infirmary, from where she was transferred to the Southern General's Intensive Care Unit. Ms Douglas's 76-year-old mother Margaret Keddie was also at her side with Mr Keddie and Miss Douglas during the three week vigil. As she carried an organ donor card, arrangements had been made to donate her kidneys, but the donation was not possible because of the prolonged nature of her death. Goodbyes: Leeanne Douglas (pictured with her mother as a baby) had to repeatedly endure her 'last moment' with her mother as she lived for three weeks after life support was turned off . Mr Keddie said: 'Plans had been made to donate Lorraine’s kidneys and a positive match had even been found. 'The doctors, like us, had expected Lorraine to pass away straight away - not three weeks later. 'But there was only a small time window, around three hours, between Lorraine dying and the organs being donated. 'So because of what happened, organ donation was no longer possible. We thought at least something good could come out Lorraine’s death. 'But she was denied her last wish - to help someone else. It was yet another devastating blow for us.'

Charged: Kristin Davis leaves the Manhattan Federal Court in New York after being arrested and charged with selling prescription pills for cash . Arrested: Former madam Kristin Davis, seen here in 2009, was arrested for distributing and possessing a controlled substance . Davis, 38, was to appear in court later Tuesday. Her attorney, Daniel Hochheiser, declined comment. The . long-shot Libertarian candidate, who has a previous conviction for . promoting prostitution, has made news by claiming to have gotten call . girls for Spitzer before a prostitution scandal forced him from office. Her . alleged connection to the Spitzer, who resigned from office in 2008 . after his trysts with prostitutes were exposed, has never been proven. Davis . got into the comptroller race before Spitzer, running on a platform to . legalize and tax marijuana as a way to close potential city budget gaps. Other candidates include . Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, also a Democrat, and . Republican John Burnett, a former Wall Street executive. According to a criminal complaint, Davis began buying Xanax, Adderall and Ecstasy from the unidentified drug dealer in 2009. She allegedly told the dealer that 'she provided these drugs to others at house parties,' the complaint says. Political venture: Davis has trailed Spitzer politically ever since he was exposed to have used prostitutes, and she was jailed for promoting prostitution. She ran in the New York gubernatorial race in 2010 (pictured), a move many thought was to keep his transgressions in the press, and now is running against him for Comptroller . In 2011, Davis asked the dealer if he would accept Adderall in exchange for Ecstasy, the complaint says, and they then traded 240 Adderall pills for 120 Ecstasy tablets. Authorities arrested the dealer in December and he agreed as part of guilty plea to record his conversations with Davis, the complaint says. In a recorded meeting on January 7, the cooperator paid Davis $675 in cash for 215 pills, it says. 'Ok, and this one is Ambien. There are 30 of those,' Davis allegedly said on tape. Running mates: It has never been proven that Davis was the madam that Spitzer contacted, but she continues to allege that she was . Authorities also alleged that in April, Davis brokered a deal for another person to sell 180 oxycodone pills to the cooperator. The complaint references a video that shows Davis bringing the person to the dealer's apartment, where the dealer used $3,600 provided by the FBI to make the purchase.

A 12-year-old boy, nicknamed Harry Potter because of his metal framed glasses, has been killed by a bolt of lightning in southern Italy. Giovanni Carlucci died instantly when a freak storm struck the beach as he holidayed with his family in Campomarino di Maruggio, in the southern region of Puglia. The lightning is thought have to have been attracted to the metal in his spectacles, which the schoolboy wore all the time, even when playing football. The tragedy cannot help but recall the popular wizarding books in which the young Harry Potter is almost killed by a bolt of black magic, leaving him with a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. The storm struck with no warning on Monday afternoon as Giovanni played kickabout with his father. It hadn’t even started raining, local media reported. When the bolt hit, he instantly suffered a cardiac arrest. A retired doctor rushed to his aid but was unable to resuscitate him, the southern newspaper Gazetto del Mezzogiorno said. The boy's 14-year-old cousin, Piergiorgio, was also struck but was successfully revived and is recovering from shallow burns and shock in hospital. Giovanni's father, who saw his son die just metres away from him, cried out desperately for help witnesses told La Repubblica newspaper. 'He grabbed him by the head the leg the arm but he wouldn't move.' 'Then he stroked his hair and begged him to speak to him, to live,' the newspaper reported. The father was himself taken ill and was admitted to hospital in a state of shock. Nickname: Giovanni was frequently called Harry Potter, played by Daniel Radcliffe in the films based on the books, because he wore glasses . The Mayor of Giovanni's hometown, Altamura, near Bari today declared a day of public mourning. Mario Stacca said the town wanted to express 'the most profound sense of loss for the absurd death of little Giovanni Carlucci.' He added: ‘It is not the time for words and moreover there are no words that can adequately express the tragedy that has struck his family’. The tragedy comes as Italy continues to be battered by unseasonal storms which have caused flooding in parts and the closure of a Metro station in Rome on Sunday.","Giovanni Carlucci, 12, died when a lighting bolt hit his glasses .

A fast-food worker killed himself by standing in front of a train the day after he told his girlfriend 'I won't be here tomorrow', an inquest heard. Teenager Marcus Rawlings also wrote letters to loved ones before he was fatally injured by the train near his home town of Bicester, Oxfordshire Coroner's Court heard. The 19-year-old died four years after his father, Andrew, died aged 43 in the same way. Marcus Rawlings, 19, seen here with his mother, Tracey, died after he was hit by a train near his home town of Bicester . The inquest into the younger Mr Rawlings' death heard how the McDonalds worker suffered a 'life changing event' - a reference to his father ending his life after the break-up of his marriage to his wife, Marcus’ mother, Tracey. His father left notes to his family and sent a string of text messages to his wife and her mother before being struck by an intercity train near Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, in January 2009. Today an inquest into his son's death heard how he had always denied feeling depressed to doctors and had no history of mental heath problems, although he had encountered a series of setbacks including failing to get into the Army because of knee injuries. Mr Rawlings also broke his right wrist during a snowboarding accident on a dry ski slope and had to cancel a holiday with friends, and also miss an Army selection day due to the injury he suffered a fortnight before his death. Mr Rawlings' girlfriend Megan Benfield told the inquest that her boyfriend said he would not see her again the day before he was struck by a train. The coroner heard that the Wycombe Wanderers football fan, who planned to undertake a mechanic apprenticeship, died after walking on tracks near Bicester. There were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death on April 8 this year, and no drugs or alcohol was found in his body. Mr Rawlings sent his girlfriend a text the day before he died saying 'I don't know how to tell you this but I won't be here tomorrow' His GP, Dr Kim Wallace, who had seen him three days before his death, said in a statement: 'There was no depression and no suicidal thoughts.' His girlfriend's statement said: 'He never confided in me about the anxieties he may have had.' Miss Benfield said she received a text message stating that Marcus needed to tell her something important, the hearing was told. 'He told me: ""I don't know how to tell you this but I won't be here tomorrow""' - Mr Rawlings' girlfriend Megan Benfield . 'He told me: ""I don’t know how to tell you this, but I won’t be here tomorrow"",' she said. 'I asked him to stop and screamed at him for an explanation. We talked it through and some services that might be able to help. After about an hour he seemed more like himself. 'He then started talking about future plans and he put some music on and we watched some TV. His mood increased considerably and he was even joking around. 'My dad picked me up the next day as I was working. I told him [Marcus] to go to the doctors.  His mood had darkened again. This was the last time I saw Marcus.' She said she exchanged 'reasonably normal' texts with her boyfriend that day, but added: 'At about 2pm, I noticed a long text which caused me concern and made me extremely worried. 'I went to his house and found out the awful news.' The coroner was told that train driver Peter Ward was operating the Marylebone to Stratford-upon-Avon train during a 6.30am to 1.30pm shift. He said in a statement: 'I saw a man who seemed to appear from nowhere... I just about had time to sound the horn...' The train driver added: 'I feel extremely sorry for the family and their loss.' Mr Rawlings was pronounced dead at 1.58pm by attending paramedics. 'I feel extremely sorry for the family and their loss' - train driver Peter Ward . Police informed the family of the tragedy and they were later handed printed out letters from Marcus addressed to his loved ones. Detective Sergeant Adrian Naylor, who investigated the death, said: 'The CCTV from the front of the train and the account from the train driver indicate that it was a deliberate act.' Mr Rawlings' mother, an accountant, said in her statement read aloud in court: 'When he [Marcus] was 15 years old there was a life-changing event for him.' She said her son had a snowboarding accident that meant he had to cancel a skiing holiday shortly before he died. Her statement went on: 'He had an operation on his wrist and was sent home to recover. He was also upset at missing an Army selection day due to his injury.' She last saw him when he was sleeping in his bed at 7am on April 8, the day he died. Suicide letters were later found on Mr Rawlings' laptop addressed to all of the family. Recording a suicide verdict Mr Salter said: 'It is not a case of someone falling onto the tracks. This was a deliberate act.' He went on: 'I have to consider what is in someone’s mind. It’s not so straightforward just with the act. There is no mental health history and he saw his GP on April 5. 'There was no cause for concern.  But we have the texts and the letters and I am satisfied that I can be certain of his intentions that he took his own life and that is the verdict I am going to record.'","Marcus Rawlings, 19, died when he was hit near home town of Bicester .

She continues to recover doctors were forced to amputate her leg, her foot and both her hands as the necrotizing fasciitis spread rapidly through her body. Paul Bales, the latest victim, was standing in Lake Sinclair near Milledgeville, preparing to install an expansion onto his dock when he cut his leg in the water on May 1, WGXA-TV reports. His son, Mike Bales, told the TV station his father didn't think much of the wound when it first happened. 'It was a very small cut. Matter of fact he just bandaged it up and then went and played golf for the next couple of days,' he said. But, within four days the cut began to swell ass the infection set in. On May 5 Mr Bales, a grandfather, went to his local hospital. Horrific: Paul Bales (right) has been fighting a flesh-eating bacteria infection for three weeks. Doctors amputated his leg on Wednesday . Family man: Mr Bales (bottom) was installing a new dock at Lake Sinclair when he accidentally cut himself . The next week he was transferred to Medical Center of Central Georgia, as doctors struggled to battle the aggressive disease. Mr Bales is now 'resting comfortably' after a portion of his left leg was removed. Doctors fear they might have to amputate more of his leg next week if the infection persists, Mike Bales told WMAZ-TV. Mr Bales terrifying ordeal, coupled with the other infection rates is beginning to cause panic in Georgia. 'Like, over the last three decades only about 200 cases nationwide. And then all of a sudden we've three or four in the last month,' Mike Bales told WGXA. Mr Bales neighbors on the lake are keeping their kids out of the water for the Memorial Day holiday, terrified that the bacteria could enter their bloodstreams, too. Outbreak: Four people have been infected with the horrific disease this month in Georgia. All infections have been as a result of cuts and wounds received in different parts of the state . Still critical: Aimee Copeland, 24, (left) remains in the hospital after her leg, foot and both hands were amputated. Lana Kuykendall, 36, (right) has just given birth to twins before she was afflicted by the disease . Don't be stubborn: Bobby Vaughn, 33, says his refusal to stay at the hospital in the first days of his infection almost cost him his life . 'People are scared they'll lose limbs. Everybody in town's scared to go out on the water,' Austin Hunter, one of Mr Bales' neighbors, told WGXA. Miss Copeland, despite her heart-breaking amputations, continues to improve. She remains in critical condition at Doctors Hospital in Augusta. On Thursday, her father Andy revealed that his daughter sat up in bed for several hours on Tuesday. 'When the doctors put Aimee up in that chair, their expectations were to give her an hour,' he wrote on her Facebook page. 'Five hours later, Aimee decided it was time to lie down. Had she been running an Olympic marathon, I think Aimee would have experienced a record-breaking, gold-medal moment.' Miss Copeland, at student at the University of West Georgia, was infected after she cut her leg when she fell from a homemade zip-line and splashed down into the Tallapoosa River near her home in Carrollton on May 1. The second victim of the flesh-eating disease, Lana Kuykendall, 36, noticed the infection on the back of her leg just hours after being released from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, where she gave birth to twins. She has had seven surgeries to remove the infected flesh and remains in critical condition at Greenville Memorial Hospital in South Carolina, near her home. The third victim, Bobby Vaughn, 33, has been upgraded to good condition after doctors removed two pounds of flesh from his groin. He is recovering at Doctors Hospital, as well, after he cut his thigh while cutting weeds in Cartersville. Despite the bizarre outbreak of the disease, Dr Mike Green, of Macon, said people shouldn't over-react and become paranoid about becoming infected. It remains very rare, he said. Insidious: This scanning electron microscopic image of WT Aeromonas hydrophila strain SSU, the bacteria responsible for the flesh-eating disease that attacked Aimee Copeland . Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat. The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications. Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.","Aimee Copeland sat up in bed for five hours in 'Olympic effort' as she continues recovery .

Pippa Middleton’s boyfriend Nico Jackson demonstrated a nifty backhand after the couple played tennis yesterday morning. The 35-year-old stockbroker put a cheeky hand on the world famous posterior as the pair enjoyed an amorous clinch on the streets of London, as passers-by looked on. Wearing her hair in a ponytail beneath a baseball cap and with a short tennis skirt, 29-year-old Pippa spent a couple of hours in the summer sunshine with her beau before they headed their separate ways. Couple: Pippa Middleton and her banker boyfriend Nico Jackson embrace after playing tennis together . Smooch: The couple kiss passionately in London's summer sun before going their separate ways . The couple have been dating for around eight months, and are reportedly set to move in together. Both sets of parents have been introduced over the last few months, and Nico has been on holiday to Mustique with the Middleton family, including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The pair were first seen together in September last year at the opening of London nightclub, Berkeley Square. ‘Nico is tall, good-looking and has the most amazing piercing blue eyes,’ said a friend. ‘He is incredibly charismatic and stands out from the crowd. He is a really good catch – everyone is after him.’ Tennis is one of their shared passions. Pippa, who attended Malborough College on a sports/all-rounder scholarship, is a keen player and last year won a place in the women’s first team at the exclusive Queen’s Club in West London. It is apt that she was pictured in tennis garb yesterday, after writing about Wimbledon in her first column for Vanity Fair magazine earlier in the week. In for the kill: The pair share an amorous moment in a London street . She even made reference to her own claim to fame by mentioning the famous Athena poster of the Seventies showing a female tennis player, calling it a ‘tennis classic with another famous bum!’ ‘All the boys at school had this on their bedroom walls,’ she wrote, admitting: ‘I’ve been sent similar cheeky ones by friends over the years.’ One of them was a 15th birthday card from her grandparents showing a cartoon rear-view of a tennis player in a very short skirt. ‘If only they’d known what was to come!’  Pippa wrote. Column: Pippa has recently started writing for Vanity Fair . She further recalled her love of the game, writing: ‘I first went to Wimbledon when I was eight years old and already a very keen tennis player.’ She even bought herself a postcard of the women’s singles trophy and signed it with the message: ‘I will win this one day’. She also told her family that if she ‘had to get married’ it would be in tennis whites, but with ‘shorts, with no pleats or frills’. Tennis is not the only sport Pippa . and Nico share a passion for, and in March they both competed in a . 26-mile ski marathon in St Moritz, Switzerland. Pippa . was cheered over the finish line by her parents, Carole and Michael, . before she was embraced by Nico, who completed the course eight minutes . ahead of her. Unlike many of Pippa’s past boyfriends, Nico doesn’t come from a particularly wealthy or privileged background. His parents, Martyn and Ulrike, run a ski and sportswear shop in Folkestone, Kent, where they live in a modest £250,000 home. Nico was educated at The Harvey Grammar School in Folkestone and Kingston University in Surrey. After graduating he made his fortune as a stockbroker and in 2010, he sold the leasehold on a luxury two-bedroom flat in a grand Georgian building in Kensington for £1.56 million. The property is just around the corner from David and Victoria Beckham’s new rented home and actor Dustin Hoffman’s townhouse. It is understood that his job at Deutsche Bank meant he was introduced to elite social circles where his good looks and charming manner allowed him to fit in effortlessly. A neighbour of the family in Folkestone said: ‘I’ve known Nico since he was a boy. ‘Nico is always very well-mannered, the whole family is. I know Nico is terrific at skiing, maybe that’s where he met Pippa, on the ski slopes.’","Nico Jackson put a cheeky hand on Pippa's behind as they kissed in London .

Lawyers for Shrien Dewani have launched a bid to get the Supreme Court to block his extradition to South Africa, where he is wanted over his wife's honeymoon death. It is the latest move to stop the 33-year-old Bristol businessman being sent to Cape Town face trial over his alleged part in the murder of his wife Anni. A judge last month ruled at Westminster Magistrates’ Court that Dewani should be extradited, rejecting his attempt to stay in the UK for further hospital treatment for mental health problems. Scroll down for video . Shrien Dewani pictured arriving for a court hearing in 2011: The Bristol businessman's lawyers have launched a bid to have his extradition to South Africa to face trial over his wife's murder blocked by the Supreme Court . Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle had already given the go-ahead to Dewani’s extradition in 2011 but was forced to reconsider the position after two senior High Court judges allowed an appeal in March last year. They were told Dewani was suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Sir John Thomas, president of the Queen’s Bench Division, and Mr Justice Ouseley said it would be 'unjust and oppressive' to remove him until he recovered. Happy day: Dewani and his wife Anni on their wedding day. He is accused of paying South African hitmen to kill his wife on their honeymoon in Johannesburg . However, they added that it was plainly in the interests of justice that he was extradited as soon as he was fit. The ruling that Dewani could finally be extradited had been welcomed by his wife's family, who are from Sweden. Today, Dewani’s lawyers lodged an application at the High Court for the two judges to now certify that their ruling raised 'a point of law of general public importance' for consideration by the Supreme Court. Dewani is suspected of ordering the killing of his new wife Anni, 28, who was shot as the couple travelled in a taxi on the outskirts of Cape Town in November 2010. Last month, Judge Riddle said Dewani was still not fit to plead or stand trial at present, but there was evidence that he would receive the care he needed in South Africa. So far three men have been convicted over Mrs Dewani’s death. Last year South African Xolile Mngeni was convicted of premeditated murder for shooting her. Prosecutors claimed that he was a hitman hired by Dewani to kill his wife, something that Dewani has consistently denied. Taxi driver Zola Tongo was jailed for 18 years after he admitted his part in the killing, and another accomplice, Mziwamadoda Qwabe, also pleaded guilty to murder and was handed a 25-year prison sentence. Dewani’s lawyers have stressed at various hearings that he will be willing to defend himself at trial once he is fit to do so.",South African prosecutors accuse Dewani of ordering his wife's killing .

Rule breach: Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher faces disciplinary charges after interviewing murderer Chris Halliwell without issuing a caution and without a solicitor being present . A murder detective who failed to read a killer his rights when persuading him to lead him to the bodies of two women could now face the sack. Wiltshire Police Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher was praised for his bravery after Christopher Halliwell led him to where he had dumped the body of missing 22-year-old Sian O'Callaghan in 2011. But the Independent Police Complaints Committee has said the officer should face a gross misconduct hearing after failing to read Halliwell his rights and interviewing him without a solicitor being present in a bid to find Miss O'Callaghan. He should also face disciplinary action for briefing the press on the case when Wiltshire Police had ordered him not to. Miss O'Callaghan, 22, had gone missing after a night out at a Swindon nightclub in March 2011. Taxi driver Halliwell, 49, had been arrested days after the disappearance and in a three hour period led police to her body. The killer then asked the detective if he 'wanted another one' and led him to the body of Rebecca Godden-Edwards who had been missing since 2002. The 20-year-old had been missing since 2002, but her estranged family had never reported her missing because they believed she had moved to London after becoming hooked on drugs. Despite revealing the location of the bodies, Halliwell was never convicted of killing Miss Godden-Edwards after a judge ruled that his confession was inadmissible because Mr Fulcher failed to follow the correct arrest procedures. He was jailed for 25 years for killing Miss O'Callaghan. Mr Fulcher admitted he broke the rules in court last year, but said he thought he was doing 'the right thing'. He was suspended for a year while an investigation was carried out but has since returned to the force. Victims: Sian O'Callaghan, left, went missing after a night out in Swindon in March 2011, while Rebecca Godden-Edwards, right, was last seen in 2002 . The investigation into Mr Fulcher's handling of the arrest found that he had breached the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) and disobeyed orders by releasing information to the media and meeting with journalists from the BBC and ITV. The resulting IPCC report said: ‘The effect of . Det Supt Fulcher’s actions was catastrophic, particularly on the . prosecution of Mr Halliwell for the murder of Rebecca [Godden-Edwards]. 'Det Supt Fulcher stated had he not . proceeded as he did, Rebecca’s remains may never have been found. Killer: Christopher Halliwell, 47, was jailed for 25 years for the murder of Miss O'Callaghan, but escaped charges over Miss Godden-Edwards death . 'However it is not possible to determine what may have happened if Mr . Halliwell had been immediately conveyed to custody after his arrest and . urgent interview by detectives.’ IPCC Deputy Chair Rachel Cerfontyne . said: ‘Detective Superintendent Fulcher’s actions were in deliberate . breach of PACE and we find that he has a case to answer for gross . misconduct. ‘Also, Detective Superintendent . Fulcher, despite no longer having responsibility for Operation Mayan . (the murder investigation), and against express orders, went ahead with . meetings about the case with journalists from both the BBC and ITV.’ The mother of Miss Godden-Edwards reacted with fury at the report yesterday accusing the watchdog of putting the killer’s rights above hers. She said: ‘He’s my hero and should not be punished. ‘He’s accused of breaching Halliwell’s rights, but what about mine? Don’t they count for anything? ‘Detective Superintendent Fulcher should be hailed as a hero, not as someone who overstepped the mark. ‘The rules should be tailored to help us as much as an accused person. ‘Without Detective Superintendent Fulcher’s initiative I would never have had closure. ‘Yes, sadly Becky is dead but I could have spent the rest of my life wondering if she was still out there alive, simply not wanting to see me, or dead.’ She has now called for a public debate on PACE rules. Hunt: Police search for Miss O'Callaghan's body following her disappearance . During the case, Wiltshire Chief Constable Patrick Geenty said his officer had been ‘brave’ and that he hoped he would have done the same thing. But Halliwell’s barrister accused the detective of riding roughshod over the law and returning to ‘70s-style policing’. The IPCC conducted a review after Miss Godden-Edwards’ father, John Godden complained about the officer’s actions. If the force agree with the IPCC findings, the detective will face a gross misconduct panel which will decide his fate. A spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: ‘We are taking this matter very seriously and we are currently in the process of carefully considering the recommendations made within the report and our subsequent response to the IPCC. ‘We will be taking into account the needs of the families whilst deliberating the recommendations. ‘Wiltshire Police are continuing to offer welfare support to Det Supt Fulcher throughout this on-going process.’","Steve Fulcher failed to read Christopher Halliwell his rights after he was arrested .

He'd say, ""I believe in the devil. I worship the . devil. I am the devil.""' Last week, Heath Campbell, who had four children, asked the judge to be allowed to see his 18-month-old son Hons. Campbell, . from New Jersey, has given three of his children Nazi-inspired names . but claims he is fit to be a father and has never abused them. Bowlby said one of his favorite activities was taking her on car rides to a local cemetery. 'To show me where he was going to bury me when he killed me,' she said. Ordeal: Heath and Deborah Campbell, pictured with son that they named Adolf Hitler, The couple have since separated . Rescued: Adolf Hitler, right, and his sister Aryan Nation were taken into custody in 2009 and have since been adopted . She also claimed he terrorised their . son, Heath. Once, furious that his two-year-old had knocked into the . curtains, Campbell picked up a running vacuum cleaner and held it inches . from Heath’s face, she said. 'He was absolutely terrified,' Bowlby . told the New York Daily News. 'For years after, he would scream and cry . when he saw a vacuum cleaner.' Before appearing in court, Campbell, who had a swastika tattoo clearly showing on his neck, told NBC10: 'I'm going to tell the judge, I love my children. I wanna be a father, let me be it. 'Let me prove to the world that I am a good father.' Pleas: White supremacist Campbell, his swastika tattoo on show,said that he wanted to show the world he could be a good father . Controversial: Campbell, who has his own neo-Nazi organization, walks into court with a supporter wearing knee-high boots and a swastika arm band . He . said that he had never abused his children and had only named them. He . has not seen his children in two years and the eldest three have been . adopted. The . 40-year-old white appeared at a hearing in Hunterdon County Family Court . in Flemington, New Jersey. His regalia included knee-high black boots . and swastika patches. He told the TV station that whether wearing his Nazi uniform might sway the judge's decision, depended on the judge. Bethanie White, a member of his organization 'Hitler's Order', was with Campbell at court - also covered in swastikas. Decisions: The Campbells, pictured leaving court in 2009, said they chose the names as they were unique . Adolf Hitler Campbell, six, and his younger sisters Joycelynn Aryan Nation, five, and Honszlynn Hinler, four, were taken into custody in January 2009. State . officials also took another son, Hons Campbell, from his parents Heath . and Deborah Campbell just hours after he was born in November 2011. A court denied the Campbells' appeal to have their children returned last year. The Nazi-inspired names came to light . after a store refused to decorate a birthday cake reading 'Happy . birthday Adolf Hitler' in December 2008. In 2010, a . New Jersey appeals court ruled there was sufficient evidence of abuse . or neglect due to prior domestic violence to seize the children. Authorities insisted putting the children into care had nothing to do with their names. Court records from previous hearings show that the oldest child, Adolf, frequently threatened to kill people. The . mother reportedly had also once given a note to her neighbour saying she . was terrified of her husband, who had threatened to kill her. The Campbells have previously defended the names, saying they chose them simply because they liked them and they were unique. Campbell said he named his son after the Nazi leader as 'no one else in the world would have that name'. Campbell has since separated from his wife and she has given up rights to her children. A follow-up hearing has been scheduled for later this month.","Ex-wife reveals Heath Campbell tried to name their first-born Lucifer .

As Prince's Trust ambassadors, Penny and singer husband Rod Stewart, along with designer Kelly Hoppen, were invited by Prince Charles to join him in opening the doors to the Prince's Trust's . new offices. Hello up there! Prince Charles is towered by 6ft 1in model Penny Lancaster as he opens his new Prince's Trust store in London today . The trust has moved from its former home near London's West End to a building close to the financial heart of the capital. Penny, 41, looked younger than her years in a tight leather pencil skirt and on-trend animal print T-shirt, which she teamed with black heels. Her husband Rod, 68, looked smart in a navy blue blazer and red chinos, which he coordinated with his shoes and tie. The . couple laughed with Charles as they posed for photographs despite the . veteran rocker and his wife arriving late for the event. Protocol . dictates that members of the Royal Family arrive last for a public . engagement - with the Queen usually turning up just minutes before an . event begins. But . Stewart and his wife, Penny Lancaster, blamed London traffic for their . 10-minute delay while travelling from their Wapping apartment, and the . singer apologised to the Prince when the pair eventually met. Charles . had already opened a Prince’s Trust shop, near the City of London, . called Tomorrow’s Store, which sells jewellery, clothing, shoes and . decorative objects designed by young entrepreneurs who have been helped . by his charity. Rod Stewart and wife Penny attended the new trust, which has moved from its former home near London's West End to a building close to the financial heart of the capital . After the apology, the two men were soon sharing a joke and when the Prince asked how the singer’s voice was, Stewart replied 'improving with age' and his wife quipped 'like a lot of other things'. Stewart, a Prince’s Trust Ambassador along with his wife, said afterwards that he always tells he children to be on time: 'We have a place over in Wapping and it took us three-quarters of an hour to get here.' He added, laughing: 'I wish I had my own police escort, I would always be on time.' Ms Lancaster praised the work of the Prince’s Trust, which has helped young entrepreneurs through its business enterprise programme. Referring to her husband, she said: 'We both became ambassadors about 10 years ago. We are able to inspire and encourage our children, who have a strong support system and financial support. But what about the children that don’t have that support system? The Prince’s Trust is a real helping hand - it’s fantastic.' The Tomorrow’s Store is within the new offices of the Prince’s Trust, which moved from its former home near London’s West End to a building close to the financial heart of the capital after the lease on its previous premises expired. Bending down? Penny appeared to be crouching low as she posed for photographs and shared a few jokes with the Prince . Charles is taking part in a number of . engagements this week to highlight the work of his charities, which . Clarence House said had given business support to almost 400,000 and . helped created more than 125,000 entrepreneurs. During his visit to the new offices, Charles received two presents for his new grandson, Prince George of Cambridge. Kimberly . Smith, who runs a children’s clothes shop in Port Talbot, South Wales, . had some of her garments on sale in the new store and presented Charles . with a baby bib decorated with the flags of the UK’s four nations.

The uncle of a seven-year-old girl has been charged with murder after her body was found in a river bed near her home. Justin DeRyke, 22, was taken into custody after the authorities discovered the body of Willow Long, who was reported missing on Sunday. A spokesman for The Effingham State's Attorney Office said all the indications suggested the death was homicide. But the girl’s grandfather, Dale DeRyke, who is also the father of the alleged killer, said his son panicked after what he claimed was an accident. Dale DeRyke told Fox2Now Justin was babysitting the little girl on Saturday night. He said the two were playing when Willow ran outside, where a pile of sticks was scattered over the floor. 'A stick went through her and through her head,' he said. 'She was laying there twitching and dying.' Mr DeRyke Snr then claims his son got scared and hid the body. Now he says his son has 'nothing but remorse,' for what he has done. Authorities would not comment on DeRyke’s statement.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:05 EST, 11 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:09 EST, 11 September 2013 . An Ohio driver who made an online . video confessing to causing a fatal wrong-way crash after a night of heavy drinking today pleaded not guilty. But attorneys for 22-year-old Matthew Cordle, from Powell, Ohio, said the plea is just preliminary and a procedural step allowing . a judge to be appointed at random to accept a guilty plea. The . attorneys said their client still plans to plead guilty as soon as . possible to accept responsibility for killing Vincent Canzani in June this year. Franklin . County Judge Julie Lynch told ABC News that Cordle's attorneys are trying to play the system by entering the not guilty plea. Scroll down for video . In court: Matthew Cordle, pictured in court on Tuesday, has entered a surprising not guilty plea in his case. Just last week he confessed to a killing in a YouTube video - but a judge said the plea is a courtroom tactic . Defense strategy: Cordle's attorney, Martin Midian (right), said his client would likely plead not guilty at his arraignment, but he still intends to plead guilty at a later date . Under Ohio law, entering a guilty plea locks in the judge which in this case is Lynch. But . she said she believes Cordle's team played the tactic after she told . them this week that she did not know how she'd sentence Cordle, who . faces between two to eight-and-a-half years in prison. It comes after Cordle's lawyers on Tuesday denied they had decided to look for a different judge, a process . known as judge shopping, which is banned by court rules. Cordle had posted a 3 1/2-minute . video confession last Thursday where he admitted to be responsible for a . fatal hit-and-run accident June 22 that left a 61-year-old man dead. Dramatic: Franklin County . Judge Julie Lynch said she thinks his lawyers are hoping for a new judge . ‘My name is Matthew Cordle, and on June 22nd, 2013, I hit . and killed Vincent Canzani,’ he said somberly. ‘This video will act as my . confession.’ Cordle is charged with aggravated vehicular homicide and a misdemeanor count of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. The preliminary plea came after Lynch . didn't allow Cordle to go ahead with a plea Tuesday, saying his . lawyers didn't follow court procedures. She has set a combined $255,000 bond. Following . Wednesday's hearing, Cordle's attorneys said it is possible the guilty . plea could still happen Wednesday, but would depend on how quickly a . judge is assigned. Judge Lynch ended the hearing shortly after it began on Tuesday. She said an expected arrangement whereby Cordle would plead guilty and be sentenced had changed - a move she described as 'nothing unusual.' 'I'm sorry you all came to this whole, big thing,' Lynch told reporters in a tone taken by many as sarcastic, NBC News reported. She added, 'If we do not remain an independent judiciary with three branches of government, then we are doomed,' before leaving the courtroom. Cordle's video was filmed September 3. It begins with Cordle's face . blurred as he describes how he has struggled with depression and was simply . trying to have a good time with friends going ‘from bar to bar’ the night of . the accident. Video confession: The 3.5 minute video starts out with his face blurred and voice altered as he explains how he was driving drunk when he killed someone . Moment of truth: Matthew Cordle identifies himself when the effects are taken away and says that he will plead guilty to any charges that he faces stemming from the June 22 accident . His pledge: Cordle, 22, said that he was fully aware of the legal implications of making the video . He then describes how he ended up driving into oncoming . traffic on Interstate 670. Cordle's face becomes clear as he reveals his name . and confesses to killing Canzani. He ends the video by pleading with viewers not to drink and . drive. 'I can't bring Mr. Canzani back, and I can't erase what I've . done, but you can still be saved. Your victims can still be saved,' Cordle . says. Then a message appears on the darkened screen: 'Make the promise to never . drink and drive.' The victim's daughter spoke out against Cordle, saying that the reason he made the confession publicly was so that he could try to get a lighter prison sentence. Angela Canzani believes Matthew Cordle, who says he hit and killed Vincent Canzani, 61, on June 22 in, was ‘totally misleading’ with his confession because he was already suspected of the crime. Victim: Vincent Canzani was 61 at the time of his death (pictured recently at right) and previously served in the Navy (seen in his uniform in an undated photo at left) ‘There was a traffic cam. There was a . third car involved,’ Canzani told NBC News. ‘So people are kind of . looking at this like he’s just coming out of nowhere…Like he’s some hero . or something.’ But on Friday, the . ex-wife of Mr Canzini told MailOnline she 'applauded' the decision of . Cordle - who now faces criminal charges brought by the county prosecutor. Cordle . says in the video he 'made a mistake' when he decided to drive his . truck home after 'drinking heavily' and hit the other car, killing Mr . Canzani, of suburban Columbus. An obituary for Mr Canzani says that he served as a missile technician for a submarine from 1980 to 1986. Since leaving the Navy, he flourished . as 'a gifted photographer' and was survived by two daughters and three . great grandchildren. The video was released in conjunction with a not-for-profit start up called Because I Said I Would, which is focused around having individuals make commitments to themselves and their goals using index cards. A fan: Cleveland kidnap victim Gina DeJesus posed for a picture with the group's shirt after the founder met with her mother . Its website says that it aims to become a 'a social movement dedicated to bettering humanity through the power of a promise'. The organization was founded by Alex Sheen who was inspired by his father, who died of lung cancer last September. At his father's funeral, they handed out promise cards in tribute to how his father always kept his promises. In a message that was posted on the group's website when the confession video was published, Mr Sheen says that Mr Cordle was the one to reach out to him via Facebook message about the hit-and-run. 'After getting to know Matt, I can say with confidence that he truly regrets his decision that night. He describes the guilt he has as “insurmountable,”' Mr Sheen wrote in the post. 'Against all legal advice, Matthew decided to make this video and release it prior to any charges being filed against him. His goal is to raise awareness about the terrible consequences that drunk driving can have on innocent people.' Cordle's confession is not the only high-profile action the group has been involved with. After the three young women were . discovered in Ariel Castro's Cleveland home, Mr Sheen was moved to . launch a ten-day walking campaign across the state in their honor. Movement: The group's founder, Alex Sheen (seen closest to the camera) was inspired to go on a 10-day state-wide walk to raise awareness for sexual abuse victims after DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight were found . Big finish: He ended the walk by being greeted by Gina DeJesus' mother at the site of the 'House of Horrors', which is just six miles away from where Sheen lives . He said that he lives six miles away from the now-razed 'House of Horrors' and was moved by the girls' perseverance. He used the walk as a way to raise awareness about sexual assault, and at the end, he was greeted by Gina DeJesus' mother. Mr Sheen gave her a number of t-shirts with the organization's name printed on them, and in return, she later sent him a picture of Gina wearing the shirt.","Matthew Cordle, 22, admitted to killing Vincent Canzani, 61, during a June drunken hit-and-run accident in Ohio in a video shared last week .

He was embraced by the Italian foreign minister and looked weary as he arrived back in Rome last night. Free: Italian journalist Domenico Quirico (left), kidnapped in Syria in early April, is greeted by Italian Foreign minister Emma Bonino (right) as he arrives at Ciampino airport in Rome . He spoke briefly by phone to his wife in June confirming he had been kidnapped but said he was in good health. 'We never lost hope and all the efforts made over the past months have been crowned with success,' Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta said in a statement confirming both men had been released and were on their way to Italy. Mr Quirico was met by Italian Foreign minister Emma Bonino on the tarmac as he landed at a military airport just outside Rome last night. Quirico, looking weary, told reporters on the tarmac of Rome's Ciampino airport that he felt as if 'he had been living on Mars' for the last five months, and that his isolation from the news was such that he didn't even know who had been elected Italian president this spring. Kidnapped: Mr Quirico pictured arriving back in Italy late last night, left, and before his ordeal, right . 'I was treated badly,' Quirico said, when a reporter asked about his time in captivity. The news was confirmed in a tweet by Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo who said he shared the emotion and relief of the men's families. There was no immediate word on who was responsible for kidnapping the two men, who were reported to have been travelling together when they were taken. Their release comes amid growing international tensions over the civil war in Syria, which has cost an estimated 100,000 lives.

Emotional: The foreign minister embraces the Italian journalist after his five month ordeal . President Bashar al-Assad is accused by many western countries of using chemical weapons, and the United States and France are considering military action in response. Italy has condemned the government in Damascus, which denies using the banned weapons, but has refused to join military action without a clear mandate from the United Nations. America last night refused to rule out seeking a United Nations resolution for action in Syria, potentially delaying any air strikes even further. Despite tough talk from the White House about the pressing need to prevent further atrocities, US Secretary of State John Kerry suggested the UN route was still open and ‘no decision has been made’. Four other Italian journalists were kidnapped in Syria in April but were released after little more than a week.

Born without her left forearm, Nicole Kelly has been overcoming disability her entire life, be it playing baseball, dancing or diving. Now representing Iowa in the Miss America pageant, Kelly hopes to win the crown and inspire others to overcome their own difficulties. She chooses to focus on what she has rather than what she lacks. 'The reason I'm here is not because I'm a public interest story,' she told The Associated Press in an interview on Monday, in between rehearsals for three nights of preliminary competition that starts Tuesday. There's no stopping her: Miss Iowa, Nicole Kelly, front row, second from left, stands with other Miss America contestants during arrival ceremonies in Atlantic City . 'I'm here not because I look different . but because I have the intelligence, I have the ability and all the . things that Miss America needs to have. 'I'm proud to represent those who look differently, but it's about what you can do and how you celebrate it,' she said. 'I'm just like you.' She said she developed an outgoing personality 'that would not give in to ""no""' as a way to deal with the stares she often got. The 23-year-old resident of Keokuk, Iowa, a Mississippi River town, Kelly said she never let her disability stop her from doing what she wanted. She played baseball, swam and dove, danced. 'I just did it,' she said. 'There never was an issue. No excuses, nor should there have been.' Crowning beauty: Nicole Kelly, who is competing for the Miss America crown after being named Miss Iowa, says she focuses on what she has rather than what she lacks . Glamorous: Although Ms Kelly says she has had unwanted attention, beauty pageants has given her the ability to bring attention to those living with disabilities . Kelly said people she met while growing up generally went through three phases: the first was when she approached them, because they were too intimidated to approach her. The second was when they grew comfortable enough to ask her questions like, 'How do you do your hair?' or 'How do you tie your shoes?' 'I'm here not because I look different . but because I have the intelligence, I have the ability and all the . things that Miss America needs to have' The third phase 'was when they completed forgot about it' and just saw her as Nikki, not a person with a disability. She entered her first pageant this January, fell in love with the competition and won, advancing through the ranks to win the Miss Iowa crown. She was soon inundated with media attention, not all of it welcome. She said one TV station surreptitiously shot close-ups of her partial arm without her realizing it and made that a central part of their report. 'I got a lot of unwanted attention, but there's also the flip side of this enormous platform' to bring attention to people with disabilities. Worthy winner: Miss Kelly says that she has never allowed her disability to stop her doing anything she dreamed of in life . Giving back: The Miss Iowa beauty is using her title to raise awareness about disabilities . Since graduating from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Kelly has landed internships in theaters in Santa Fe, N.M.; Chicago and New York. That led to a paid job as the guardian for child actors in the Broadway play 'The Assembled Parties.' Kelly is scheduled to sing during the talent portion of the competition. She hopes to work in theater management – after winning the Miss America pageant. 'It would definitely be cool to win the crown, but I want the job: I want to be in a new city every second day, I want to log 20,000 miles on airplanes and meet new people all the time.' She would not be the first Miss America with a disability. In 1995, Miss Alabama, Heather Whitestone won the crown with a hearing impairment. The 2014 Miss America will be crowned Sunday night in Atlantic City's Boardwalk Hall, as the pageant returns home after a six-year stint in Las Vegas.

Kidnapping victim Amanda Berry's father has spoken about his daughter's reaction to Ariel Castro's suicide for the first time, saying that she is 'relieved that the monster is dead'. Before his death, Berry fought to insure that he would not have legal visitation rights to see Jocelyn, the six-year-old daughter that she gave birth to while being held by Castro. Her father Johnny Berry said that she 'has been living in constant fear that Jocelyn may someday have to see Castro, and she didn’t want that ever to happen'. Her thoughts were revealed just hours after two corrections officers who were in charge of watching Castro were put on paid leave following the incident. Suicide: The two corrections officers who were guarding Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro have been placed on administrative leave following his death on their watch at the Ohio prison . The end: Castro acknowledged in court last month that he would die in prison . Survivor: Amanda Berry and two other young women were kidnapped and held by Castro for over a decade .

He . told The National Enquirer that the only thing about Castro's suicide . that upset him was 'that I wanted to kill that b****** myself'. 'I . thought that maybe he got killed — animals like him get taken out all . the time in the prison system,' Mr Berry said about when he first heard . the news. 'But I’m glad he’s dead. I hope he died real slow.' The officers haven't been found guilty of . any wrong doing but are on leave pending the review board's decision, . according to 19 Action News.

Castro was serving a life sentence plus 1,000 years for abducting, raping, and holding hostage Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus.

"By . Matt Chorley and Sam Webb . PUBLISHED: . 06:44 EST, 10 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:10 EST, 10 September 2013 . David Cameron today demanded a deadline be set for Syria to destroy its stock pile of chemical weapons, in an apparent breakthrough in the international stand-off. With US Congress poised to vote on missile strikes against the Assad regime, the Syrian government dramatically accepted a Russian proposal to turn over control of its chemical weapons to the international community. Britain, France and America planned to table a UN security council resolution as early as today, setting thresholds and timetables for the plan to come into effect - but Russia appears set to veto it. Scroll down for video . Caution: Prime Minister David Cameron warned that more detail was needed to see if Syria was 'serious' about handing over its stockpile of chemical weapons . The idea emerged yesterday in an . apparent gaffe by US Secretary of State John Kerry who announced that . Assad could avoid U.S. military action by turning over 'every single bit . of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next . week.' Speaking in London he added: 'But he isn’t about to do it, and it can't be done, obviously.' But within hours Syrian Foreign . Minister Walid al-Moualem and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov both . expressed interest in the plan as did UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said after meeting with . the Russian parliament speaker that his government quickly agreed to . the Russian initiative to 'derail the U.S. aggression.' Mr Cameron insisted it remained a 'new proposal' but he was keen to explore if it was a 'serious one'. Giving evidence to a committee of senior MPs, the Prime Minister urged caution in thinking the plan would be enacted. Mr Cameron said: 'We have to remember that Syria has the biggest supply of chemical weapons anywhere in the world. 'If it is a serious one, then it is one we should take very seriously, because it could achieve a major goal we have as a Government - to get rid of chemical weapons.' Smoke rises from buildings due to heavy artillery shelling in Barzeh, a district of Damascus, Syria, today . He spoke to President Obama about the idea during the G20 in Russia on Friday. The two men spoke on the phone today after ‘things moved faster than was anticipated’, Mr Cameron said. He said the security council resolution would be drafted to give 'some clarity about thresholds, that there’s some proper timetable, some proper policies' 'And crucially that there has to be confidence to ensure it is done. Of course we should be sceptical. Of course we should not forget that a major war crime has been committed. 'I think we do need some deadlines. We do need some timetables. It is not about someone monitoring chemical weapons in Syria. 'It’s got to be about handing them over to the intervational community and destroying them.' Laurent Fabius says France, a permanent member of the 15-nation U.N. body, will start the resolution process on today. Fabius . said the proposal will be under Chapter 7 of the U.N. charter - which . would back up the resolution with a threat of force if not applied - and . will 'condemn' a chemical weapons attack in Syria on August 21. Foreign Secretary William Hague said: 'We have to make sure that this is not just a distraction tactic' Foreign Secretary William Hague also urged caution, saying: 'How do you tell the difference between breakthroughs and delay tactics? That's exactly what we have to think about here. 'We have to make sure that this is not just a distraction tactic.' French officials said their draft resolution was designed to make sure the Russian proposal would have teeth, by allowing military action if Assad is uncooperative. 'It was extremely well played by the Russians, but we didn't want someone else to go to the U.N. with a resolution that was weak. This is on our terms and the principles are established. It puts Russia in a situation where they can't take a step back after putting a step forward,' said a French diplomatic source. A White House official says President Barack Obama has agreed to discussions at the United Nations Security Council to Russia's proposal to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles. The official says Obama discussed the proposal yesterday with French President Francois Hollande and British Prime Minister David Cameron. Obama has said the proposal marks a potential breakthrough that could halt plans for a U.S. military strike, though he said the details remain unclear. The official requested anonymity because the officials was not authorised to discuss the private conversations by name. But rebel forces say the Russian proposal 'is a cheap trick to buy time for the regime to kill more and more people,' said Sami, a member of the local opposition coordinating committee in the Damascus suburb of Erbin, also hit by last month's chemical attack. However, any deal with Syria to hand over its chemical weapons in the middle of a chaotic civil war would be difficult for inspectors to enforce and destroying them would likely take years, U.S. officials and experts caution. Syria's strongest backer, Russia, proposed on Monday that Damascus save itself from a U.S. military strike over its alleged use of chemical weapons by putting its stockpiles under international control. French foreign minister Laurent Fabius says France will float a resolution to remove and destroy Syria's chemical weapons . The proposal was welcomed by Syria and seized upon by the secretary-general of the United Nations. U.S. President Barack Obama said the offer was a potential breakthrough but had to be handled with skepticism. Syria has never signed a global treaty banning the storage of chemical weapons and is believed to have large stocks of sarin, mustard gas and VX nerve agents. The actual use of chemical weapons is banned by a 1925 treaty to which Damascus is a signatory. Accounting for Syria's chemical arms cache - believed to be spread over dozens of locations - would be difficult, as would be shielding arms inspectors from violence. 'This is a nice idea but tough to achieve,' said one U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity. 'You're in the middle of a brutal civil war where the Syrian regime is massacring its own people. Does anyone think they're going to suddenly stop the killing to allow inspectors to secure and destroy all the chemical weapons?' the official said. However, Russia says it is working on an 'effective, clear, concrete' plan for putting Syria's chemical weapons under international control and is discussing the details with Damascus, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday. Lavrov told reporters the plan would be presented to other nations soon and that the proposal, which Moscow hopes will avert possible U.S. military strikes on Syria, was not entirely Russian and grew out of contacts with the United States. It also emerged today that Syrian rebels may launch a chemical weapon at Israel to provoke an international reaction. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, left, and his Syrian counterpart Walid al-Mouallem . They say they will push for the United Nations to continue their probe into the use of chemical weapons . Multiple sources have made the claim, according to Russia Today, an English language news network based in Russia. The rebels intend the attack to be a 'major provocation', according to the network . A western journalist released after being held hostage in Syria for five months has claimed President Assad’s regime was not responsible for the use of chemical weapons in a Damascus suburb. Belgian writer Pierre Piccinin, who was freed on Monday, said that the rebel captors who held him prisoner claimed that it was insurgents rather than President Bashar al-Assad who had ordered the Ghouta massacre. Piccinin said that he and Domenico Quirico, an Italian journalist who was held and released with him, heard their jailers talking about the chemical weapon attack and saying that Assad was not to blame. His co-captive Quirico confirmed that he too had overheard the conversation through a closed door but said that he had no evidence to corroborate what he heard. Piccinin said the hostages despaired when they learnt that the U.S. was planning to launch retaliatory air strikes against the Assad regime over the Damascus attack. A Syrian man mourning over a dead body after an alleged poisonous gas attack fired by regime forces, according to activists, in Douma town, Damascus, Syria . He told Belgian RTL radio: ‘It wasn't the government of Bashar al-Assad that used sarin gas or any other gas in Ghouta.’ ‘We are sure about this because we overheard a conversation between rebels. It pains me to say it because I've been a fierce supporter of the Free Syrian Army in its rightful fight for democracy since 2012.’ ‘We were prisoners, stuck with this information and unable to report it,’ he said. Piccinin and Quirico were taken hostage in early April four days after arriving in Syria. They eventually ended up in the hands of the Islamist rebel group the Farouq Brigades. Meanwhile, a U.S. defence chief says Military action against Syria will deter North Korea from using chemical weapons. Slaughter: More than 110,000 people have died in the Syrian civil war so far . Under secretary of defence for policy James Miller said a retaliatory strike against the Syrian government would uphold the international norm that chemical weapons must not be used. Defence secretary Chuck Hagel has warned that North Korea possesses a massive stockpile of chemical weapons that threatens South Korea and the 28,000 US troops stationed there. Russia's chemical weapons proposal boosted Asian shares today, as fears eased over military strikes. Andrew Sullivan at Kim Eng Securities in Hong Kong said markets were boosted by the easing of concerns over Syria in the short term and continuing good data out of Japan and China, Asia's two biggest economies.","US Secretary of State John Kerry floated on idea of handing over weapons .

Security checks and bumpy air are all in a day's training at a Hollywood film studio to prepare your dog for a safe and calm flight. The Air Hollywood class is billed as the first in a real fuselage on a sound stage with a simulator that mimics takeoff, turbulence and landing. Hollywood extras create crowds and chaos that come with terminals, luggage carts and the blare announcing arrivals, delays and departures. Dogs on a plane: Megan Blake, Air Hollywood K9 Flight School Program Director, sitting left, front row, with dog Super Smiley, far right, and other puppies from the Canine Companions who are learning to fly . The idea was the brainchild of Talaat Captan, president and CEO of Air Hollywood, the world's largest aviation-themed film studio, who noticed a dog owner having a rough go getting a pooch through airport security. 'The owner was stressed out and the dog was freaking out,' Captan said. 'I figured, 'Why don't I train those people?' He hired his friend and former actress, Megan Blake, to write a program and teach the class with three other instructors and her dog Super Smiley. An animal trainer and lifestyle coach, Blake also has a psychology degree from Georgia State University. With more dogs racking up air miles these days, it makes sense to take obedience school to a new level, said Heidi Heubner, who directs volunteers, including airport therapy dogs, at Los Angeles World Airport. Hollywood studio: Members and volunteers from Guide Dogs for the Blind, GDB, take a K9 flight class, as they wait in line at a mock TSA screening at the Air Hollywood K9 flight school . There are no numbers on how many pets are taking to the skies, but they have become essential parts of a growing number of families and traveling with them for work and play is becoming more common, said Kim Cunningham, a spokesman for the International Pet and Animal Transportation Association in Texas. It will vary by airline, but there's always a fee for cabin pets – those under 20 pounds that have to stay in carriers under the seat during a flight. Workings dogs or trained service animals (most airlines also allow psychiatric and emotional support animals, too) fly free, but owners must give the airline documentation and advance notice. The animals sit at their owner's feet during flights. The class doesn't address cargo pets. The class is using the same studio where parts of Bridesmaids, Kill Bill and 500 other movies were made. Television scenes from NCIS, Modern Family and The Newsroom have also been filmed there. Last year, Air Hollywood conducted a test class with 60 puppies from Guide Dogs for the Blind. 'Some of the handlers were more nervous than the dogs because they don't like to fly,' said Rick Wilcox, who oversees puppy-training in Southern California. 'It was amazing how realistic it was.' Learning to fly: The classes take place in Air Hollywood, the world's largest aviation-themed film studio . Two things are deliberately absent in the simulated airport: the smell of jet fuel and a change in cabin pressure that makes your ears pop. Captan opened his studio about six months before Sept. 11. On Sept. 12, the phone started ringing because airports were locked down and movie and television studios couldn't shoot scenes they needed. The studio has grown to include everything from a private jet to a 747, as well as props and supplies. A guide dog takes longer and costs more than any other dog to train because they must be the eyes of their companion. So it wasn't surprising 'that they all went through with flying colors,' Blake said. Going through security, none of the dogs balked or barked at the security wands or pat-downs, even if the wands set off alarms because of their leashes. Famous studio: The 2011 movie Bridesmaids used the same Hollywood Air studio to film airport its scenes (actors from film pictured) The dogs sat at their handlers' feet in the cabin during the simulated flight, which came with engine sounds, the captain speaking, cabin lights being dimmed, overhead bins being shut and warm-up vibrations, Wilcox said. If there was any nervousness, it was during the simulated takeoff, landing or turbulence. When a dog gets nervous, it might clamp its jaw, lick its lips or get wide-eyed, Blake said. With the dogs in the test class, petting was enough to reassure them, she said. The staff was very knowledgeable about dog behavior and gave good advice, Wilcox said. 'If a dog gets nervous, don't coddle them.' That's the same thing we use to raise confident, well-balanced dogs,' Wilcox said. The studio is taking reservations for its first paid daylong class on Oct. 19. Classes will be held every month or two and will be open to well-behaved dogs of any age.Captan and Blake's collaboration isn't the first time they've worked together on a sound stage. He was the producer and she was an actress in the science-fiction thriller ""Digital Man"" 18 years ago.","Air Hollywood is the world's largest aviation-themed film studio .

The medal of honor presented to Joshua Chamberlain for his role in the Battle of Gettysburg has been returned to the Civil War General's hometown after being found at a church sale. The medal, awarded in 1893, three decades after the historic battle, was returned to the Brunswick museum housed in the General's former home by an anonymous person who found it in a book. Its return is timely, arriving back in Maine in time for the 150th anniversary of the famous civil war battle. Civil War find: General Chamberlain's Medal of Honor has been returned to a museum devoted to him . Pride: General Chamberlain, pictured wearing his medals in 1900, was thanked by President Grover Cleveland for his gallantry at Gettysburg . When Pejepscot Historical Society first received an anonymous package containing the medal, staff were skeptical that it was the original, according to the Times Record. After being examined by experts from the Smithsonian and the Army, it was revealed as the General's medal, which had been presented to him by President Grover Cleveland for 'distinguished gallantry'. Chamberlain fought in at least 24 battles during the Civil War, was wounded six times and had six horse shot from under him. He is best remembered for the battle of Little Round Top, on the second day of Gettysburg, when he helped Union forces hold off a rebel attack. The brass medal may have lost some of its shine, and its ribbons are slightly ragged, but its significance is not lost on the Maine town the General called his home. 'Our gratitude to the donor who . discovered this treasure, and knew its importance to us and to the state . of Maine, knows no bounds,' Jennifer Blanchard, of the historical society, told CBS News. After the General's death in 1914, it was passed down through his family, until his granddaughter - and last living relative - Rosamund Allen died in 2000. Distinguished: General Joshua Chamberlain fought in at least 24 battles and survived being shot six times . Her estate was donated to Duxbury Church, which is how it came to be unwittingly sold in the pages of a book during a sale. Ms Blanchard said: 'There is photographic evidence that Chamberlain was very proud of the medal, that he wore it quite often.' It was returned just before the town celebrated its annual Chamberlain day in the summer, but the museum decided to keep its discovery a secret until it had been confirmed as the original medal.","Anonymous donor returns relic to museum devoted to General .

The secret, say consumer experts, is the fact that Burberry share so much unique content exclusively with their followers on social networking platforms, and post new and different content to each one. What is posted on Facebook will be different from that on Twitter, and dialogues are constantly being carried out across both. Just this morning, Burberry placed . three new videos from their latest campaign, starring My Week With . Marilyn star Eddie Redmayne and Cara Delevingne, onto their YouTube channel. And at the news that the brand had . reached 10million Facebook fans, Burberry Chief Creative Officer Christopher . Bailey uploaded a personal thank you via a video message to the site. Days later, a further 163,000 had joined. At ease: The two chat between shots . All this direct contact gives fans that bit more involvement with the brand - and keeps them connected. 'Christopher is really involved,' Burberry told MailOnline. 'He has answered fans' questions personally on . Facebook, and he's very active on Twitter.' 'It gives people something new. It's a direct and personal route for them.' Their groundbreaking, inclusive . approach goes against the practiced elitism of luxury brands, and ultimately brings . fans closer rather than keeping them at a distance. While other fashion houses operate . strict closed-door policies that isolate all but the inner circle - Tom . Ford famously showed his last collection to a tiny selection of invited . contacts, with no photographers and only a handful of select Press allowed - Burberry have . embraced this public approach. Indeed, Burberry was the world's first . fashion house to 'Tweettalk', posting images from its autumn/winter fashion show on to . Twitter - . before the models had even stepped out onto the catwalk. The innovative move meant fans . were able to see the collection before the celebrity front row and the . fashion Press had even caught a glimpse. For his part, current star of the . campaign Eddie Redmayne reports that Christopher Bailey is, as one would . expect from his democratic approach to business, a 'gem of a man' 'I am a huge fan of Christopher Bailey,' he says. 'He is a brilliant designer and a brilliant man. 'The fashion world can be a tad intimidating but Christopher remains a kind, grounded gem of a man. And judging by the latest figures, there are at least 10 million people out there who agree. Intense: Cara, 18, has been the face of Burberry since January last year, when she appeared in the brand's S/S11 campaign . Check it out: The spring/summer Burberry campaign starring My Week With Marilyn's Eddie Redmayne and Brit socialite and model Cara Delevingne . The pair model the Spring Summer 2012 collection for the Burbery Prorsum collection . Social media success story: Burberry has over 10m Facebook fans - and counting . About the videos, Bailey says: 'We wanted to capture a moment in the lives of two exciting and inspiring British actors who have been part of the Burberry family for several years. 'The images reflect the mood of the collection through Eddie's and Cara's energy, playfulness and effortless elegance and I have such huge admiration for them both.'

At least 89 people have reported getting sick after eating Chobani Greek yogurt manufactured in Twin Falls, Idaho, the FDA has revealed - a week after the company announced a recall of containers. Symptoms have been described by consumers as nausea and cramps, Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman told The Times-News yesterday. No link has been confirmed between the illnesses and the yogurt. However, Ward says the FDA is working with Chobani to hasten its voluntary recall. Chobani is pulling some of its Greek yogurt from supermarket shelves after hearing of 'swelling or bloating' in cups - 89 people have complained of being sick so far . Chobani last week told grocery stores to destroy 35 varieties of yogurt reported to have been contaminated by a mold associated with dairy products. Chobani spokeswoman Amy Juaristi said last Thursday that 95 per cent of the tainted product had been destroyed. The affected yogurt cups have the code 16-012 and expiration dates between Sept. 11 and Oct. 7. Health officials have said the yogurt is not a public health threat, but the company said last week the 'mold can act as an opportunistic pathogen for those with compromised immune systems.' Juaristi told the newspaper on Monday that they had identified the source of the issue at the Twin Falls plant and had taken steps to prevent it from happening again. The company has not said what caused the outbreak or how it would prevent a reoccurrence. The company said it has investigated and found a type of mold commonly found in dairy that may be to blame. Chobani said the affected product came from its Idaho facility and represents less than 5 per cent of its total production. The company has been working with retailers to remove and replace the contaminated containers. A Facebook user posted this photo of what she said was 'fizzy' yogurt that made a hissing sound when opened . Chobani, which is based in New Berlin, N.Y., did not say how many of its cups or what varieties were affected. The effort was voluntary and it is not issuing a formal recall. A representative for Kroger, the nation's largest traditional supermarket operator, said Chobani issued a product withdrawal Friday. 'It was not a food safety issue,' Kroger spokesman Keith Dailey said in an email. Last Tuesday, Chobani was responding to people who were complaining about their yogurt cups on Twitter. One person described her cup as 'unnervingly fizzy,' another said the cups were like 'yogurt soup' and another said it tasted like 'wine.' Yet another person said the strawberry flavor they bought tasted 'really old.' Chobani, which says it uses only high-quality, natural ingredients, has grown rapidly since it was founded in 2005. Greek yogurt in general has surged in popularity as well, with fans saying they prefer its thicker consistency and relatively higher protein content when compared with the sweeter yogurt varieties that have long been sold in American supermarkets. The private company had an estimated $244 million in revenue in 2010, according to S&P Capital IQ. Chobani says customers with the affected code dates should contact its customer service team at care(at)chobani.com to get replacement products.","Consumers named symptoms as nausea and cramps .

Kali contracted the killer infection at a water park in Arkansas nine weeks ago and had been fighting for her life since July 19. 'I was real sick, momma wouldn't leave the hospital at all. Momma was scared to leave me, she told me', Kali said. And now that the youngster is ready to go home, she is looking forward to the future and said she wants to grow up to be a hair stylist. 'I plan to become a hair stylist and do hair. Yup, that's my dream.' Kali was previously allowed out of the hospital in Little Rock, Arkansas to visit a restaurant with friends and relatives last Thursday - her first time out since she contracted the virus at a water park July 19. Kali hugs Scout the Arkansas Children's Hospital mascot in Little Rock, Ark., before being released . At the dinner, Kali and her mother Traci said they were overwhelmed by the support from people as Kali recovered from the infection - making her only the third person to do so in the past 50 years. 'It makes me feel loved,' Kali told KARK. 'Thank you for all you've done for me, and for ya'll praying for me.' She added that she was looking . forward to walking by herself again at her rehab sessions. Doctors said . they are unsure whether or not she has sustained permanent brain damage. Kali . was diagnosed with the harrowing form of meningitis caused by an amoeba . called Naegleria fowleri, which expects believe swam into her body from . warm, shallow water at a water park.

There were only 128 such infections . reported in the United States between 1962 and 2012, according to the . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Her family has been updating her followers with news on a Prayers for Kali Le Ann Facebook page and posted an image of her out with her friends for dinner at the steak house.

Health officials believe Kali got sick after a trip to a now-shuttered Arkansas water park that features a sandy-bottomed lake. Naegleria . fowleri (pronounced nuh-GLEER'-ee-uh FOW'-lur-ee) often is found in . warm bodies of freshwater, such as lakes, rivers and hot springs. The amoeba typically enters the body through the nose as people are swimming or diving.

Support: A team of U.S. soldiers in Kuwait show their support by holding a sign reading: 'Kali's crew' Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is as rare as it is horrific. It is caused by an amoeba that implants itself in its victim's brains - usually when infected water shoots up their noses. The amoeba needs very specific conditions to thrive. It grows in the sediment at the bottom of pools of warm, stagnant water and is most active at about 85 degrees. The water must reach a relatively high temperature for the parasites to reach numbers that threaten humans. Health officials have recorded only 125 instances of the disease in the United States in the last 50 years. Only one person has survived in the United States. One other survivor was found in Mexico . Health officials say swimmers can reduce their risks even further by keeping their heads above water; using nose clips or holding the nose shut when the head is submerged; avoid stirring up sediment in shallow areas. It can then travel to the brain, causing a devastating infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis, or PAM. That's what Kali has been battling. Initial symptoms usually start within one to seven days and may include headache, fever, nausea and vomiting. The disease progresses rapidly, and other symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations. Moreover, the infection destroys brain tissue and can cause brain swelling and death. Doctors say Kali's success is due in large part to experimental treatment and early detection and diagnosis. Traci Hardig brought Kali to Arkansas Children's Hospital with a nasty fever on July 19 - and doctors have credited this fast thinking with her daughter's miraculous recovery. Doctors cooled Kali's body down to try to reduce the swelling, and they won clearance to treat her with a breast-cancer drug. Now, tests show no sign of the parasite in her system. 'It's . still a concern that she could certainly have some deficits long-term . and not function entirely as she would have if this had never happened,' one of her doctors, Dr. Vikki Stefans, said.

A former Pinochet lieutenant has been served with a civil lawsuit by the family of a celebrated Chilean poet who they believe murdered him following the country's 1973 coup which took place 40 years ago on Wednesday. Victor Jara's family have filed a civil lawsuit accusing former Chilean army Lt. Pedro Barrientos . Nunez of ordering soldiers to torture Jara. The suit claims that Barrientos fired the fatal shot while playing a game of 'Russian . roulette' inside a locker room in Santiago’s Estadio Chile, where some . 5,000 supporters of socialist President Salvador Allende were being . detained. The Jara family, led by Victor's widow Joan, filed the lawsuit last Wednesday in Jacksonville, Florida, in the hope that it will reinforce the case against Barrientos to have him extradited to Chile where he faces murder charges. The family's legal team said that Barrientos was served notice when he . opened the door at his home in Deltona, Florida, where he now lives as a . U.S. citizen, a right obtained through marriage. Hero of the people: Beloved Chilean folk singer Victor Jara was tortured and murdered by the Pinochet regime following the 1973 coup . Never giving up: Joan Jara (left), widow of musician Victor Jara, Chilean actor Nelson Villagra and Victor's niece Amanda Jara. Joan Jara has fought for 40 years to bring his killers to justice . In September 1973, Mrs Jara was faced with the unthinkable task of identifying her husband's body after he had been rounded up at the university where he worked as a professor. The body of Mr Jara, who worked as a university professor, had been riddled with bullets, his fingers and wrists broken, his stomach ripped out. The poet's 86-year-old widow told the Daily Telegraph: 'It has been tough to keep fighting for 40 years but Victor's case is so important not just for us, but for all the families that are still suffering because of the brutality and the terrible crimes committed in those years.' Barrientos, part of a group of officers . who also face criminal charges in Chile related to the folk singer’s . killing, has denied all involvement, saying he wasn’t there and didn’t . even know who Jara was at the time of the coup. 'I do not need to face justice because I have not killed anyone,' he told Chilevision TV in May 2012. Last December, Barrientos and another officer were charged in Chile with murdering Jara, while five other former military officers were named as accomplices. Most were detained, but Barrientos, who left Chile in 1989, has yet to face justice. History catching up: Pedro Barrientos Nunez, a former lieutentant of the Pinochet regime, has been served with a civil lawsuit over the poet's deathPedro Barrientos Nunuz . The criminal case has yet to be tried in Chile, but this civil suit claims that Barrientos led the 'criminal enterprise'. It makes seven civil claims, including torture, extrajudicial killing and crimes against humanity. The suit invokes two U.S. laws, the Torture Victim Protection Act and the Alien Tort Statute, that give U.S. courts standing to judge allegations of rights violations committed in other countries. Victor Jara, whose songs tackled social and political issues, was swept up with thousands of other Allende supporters as Gen. Augusto Pinochet consolidated power in September 1973. The lawsuit alleges that the folk singer was pulled from the crowd and was taken to a locker room inside the stadium where Barrientos ordered soldiers under his command to torture him. According to the lawsuit: 'Lieutenant Barrientos put a pistol to the back of Victor Jara’s head and proceeded to ''play'' rounds of ‘Russian roulette. 'Lieutenant Barrientos loaded one bullet in the chamber of his pistol, spun the chamber and pulled the trigger, knowing that each shot could be lethal.' Finally, Barrientos 'shot Victor Jara in the back of the head at point blank range,' and then 'ordered five military conscripts under his command to repeatedly shoot Victor Jara’s corpse' at least 40 times before dumping the body outside, the lawsuit says. On September 11, 1973, a U.S.-backed junta bombed the presidential palace in Chile's capital Santiago to overthrow the socialist government of president Salvador Allende. Allende refused to surrender and committed suicide in the palace after his armed forces turned against him. In the months that followed the coup d'état, leader of the army, General Augusto Pinochet assumed power and brought a reign of terror down upon his people. Many fled to live in exile while those who remained that were considered Allende sympathizers and left-leaning liberals were rounded up and detained. Pinochet's dictatorship killed 3,095 people and made 1,000 or so others . 'disappear' during the 17-years that it held power over Chile. The . government recently acknowledged 9,800 other victims, increasing the . list of those killed, tortured or imprisoned for political reasons to . 40,018. To this day, the bodies of those who lost their lives to one of the darkest periods in Chilean history are still being found. The suit doesn’t identify any witnesses, but attorney Almudena Bernabeu with the San Francisco-based Center for Justice and Accountability, which is assisting the Jara family, told The Associated Press that Barrientos’ responsibility was verified by two witnesses who corroborated information supplied by former conscript Jose Paredes, who himself was originally charged with Jara’s murder. The singer’s widow Joan Jara and her . daughters Amanda Jara Turner and Manuela Bunster, who were eight and 13 . years old when Jara was killed, are seeking unspecified compensatory and . punitive damages.

The three-day event, guaranteed to be a star-studded and lavish affair, remains shrouded in secrecy with the couple doing everything possible to keep details about their nuptial’s top secret. The guest list is expected to include a host of star names including Jay Z and Beyonce, as well as LeBron’s Miami Heat teammate Dwyane Wade and his girlfriend Gabrielle Union.

Hotel staff and pretty much everyone involved with the wedding have been asked to sign non-disclosure agreements, but one tell-tale sign about the venue is about to host something out of the ordinary is the large tent that's been erected outside. The extravaganza is being organized by celebrity wedding planner Preston Bailey, who also oversaw internet entrepreneur Sean Parker’s $10 million ‘Lord of the Rings’-themed wedding to Alexandra Lenas back in June.

Prehistoric crocodiles were able to run around like dogs to escape the jaws of predatory dinosaurs. This is according to a study that shows for the first time how these reptiles evolved in a dinosaur dominated world. Today, most modern crocodiles live in freshwater habitats and feed on mammals and fish. Prehistoric crocodiles were able to run around like dogs to escape the jaws of predatory dinosaurs. This is according to a study that shows, for the first time, how these reptiles evolved in a dinosaur dominated world . But their ancestors were very different creatures, with some running around on land like dogs while others adapted to life in the open ocean, imitating the behaviour of whales. The study, by Bristol University, reveals how the jaws of the ancient crocodiles evolved to enable these fierce animals to survive in vastly different environments . Tom Stubbs, who led the research, said: ‘The ancestors of today's crocodiles have a fascinating history that is relatively unknown compared to their dinosaur counterparts. Today, most modern crocodiles live in freshwater habitats and feed on mammals and fish. But their ancestors were very different creatures, with some running around on land like dogs while others adapted to life in the open ocean, imitating the behaviour of whales . Sample of jaws from the Mesozoic crocodile record . ‘They were very different creatures to the ones we are familiar with today, much more diverse and, as this research shows, their ability to adapt was quite remarkable. ‘Their evolution and anatomical variation during the Mesozoic Era was exceptional. ‘They evolved lifestyles and feeding ecologies unlike anything seen today."" The team examined variation in the shape and biomechanics function of the lower jaws in over 100 ancient crocodiles during the Mesozoic - a period which began 251 million years ago and covered over 170 million years. The study revealed that ancient crocodiles invaded the Jurassic seas and evolved jaws built primarily for water efficiency to capture agile prey, such as fish. The research also found that variation peaked again in the Cretaceous period- 142 million years ago - where ancient crocodiles evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes as they adapted to a diverse range of food. After the devastating end-Triassic extinction event, crocodile ancestors invaded the seas and evolved jaws primarily built to efficiently swim in the water to catch agile prey such as fish. They also evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes during the Cretaceous Period - about 145 million to 65 million years ago - as they adapted to a diverse range of niches and environments alongside the dinosaurs, including eating plants. Surprisingly, the lower jaws of Cretaceous crocodiles did not have a huge amount of variation. Instead, the fossil record points towards novel adaptations in other areas of their anatomy, such as armadillo-like body armour. Dr Stephanie Pierce, from the Royal Veterinary College said: ‘Our results show that the ability to exploit a variety of different food resources and habitats, by evolving many different jaw shapes, was crucial to recovering from the end-Triassic extinction and most likely contributed to the success of Mesozoic crocodiles living in the shadow of the dinosaurs.’","Bristol University looked at the lower jaws of over 100 ancient crocodiles .

A man who was shocked to learn the beautiful woman beside him as he came out of surgery was his wife today revealed he cannot remember any of the hilarious conversation caught on camera. Jason Mortensen and his wife Candice appeared on the Today show on Wednesday morning after the cell phone video - in which he calls her 'eye candy' and 'the prettiest woman I've ever seen' as his anesthesia wore off - became an internet sensation. But the Utah couple was also forced to deny the video was a fake after it emerged Mr Mortensen had a profile on an auditions website where his occupation was listed as 'actor/model'. 'I can understand the skepticism,' he said, but added that he had given permission to his surgeon to tell the media that he had indeed undergone a procedure before the video was filmed. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . New-found fame: Jason Mortensen, who was filmed groggily praising his wife's beauty after leaving surgery in a hilarious video, has appeared on the Today show with his wife, Candice . Fans: The Today show hosts laughed at the video, which the couple insisted was not a fake . 'I've had surgeries previously and I've been a weirdo every time,' Mortensen added. 'I'm glad she had the sense to pull out her camera.' His wife added: 'He had been acting like that for about 20 minutes before I pulled out my phone. I thought, ""I need to record this so he can see how he acts"". 'He genuinely didn't remember a thing about that when I told him.' In . the clip a bleary-eyed Mortensen lays on a hospital gurney eating a . cracker and moaning in pain before looking over at his wife. He asks: . 'Did the doctor send you? Man you are eye candy!

Out of it: Mortensen calls his wife Candice 'eye candy' and the 'prettiest woman I've ever seen' in the video . Apparently dumbfounded, Mortensen murmurs: 'You're my wife?! Holy s***! Dang. How long? Man, I hit the jackpot!' Mr Mortensen said he was undergoing surgery for a hernia repair to fix residual tears from a previous surgery. 'This was my fifth surgery within our six years of marriage and she's been by my side through all of it,' he said. 'In a previous surgery I suffered a severe complication and we didn't know if I'd ever function the same again. She is the love of my life.' But claims that the video was faked were circulating last night after an old profile of Jason Mortensen was found on an auditions website where his occupation is listed as 'actor/model'. Describing himself as 'very ambitious' and listing a range of sports including soccer, baseball and motorcross . among his special skills, the aspiring actor says his objectives are . movies, TV shows and commercials. Another development saw Dr. Larry Squire, a memory loss specialist at the University of California . San Diego, also cast doubt on the clip which now has millions of Youtube . hits. 'Love of my life': Jason and Candice married six years ago and he has had five surgeries during that time . Speaking to Slate .

But the Mortensens' denial that the video is no fake will no doubt please the legion of commenters . who were quick to praise him as 'husband of the year'.

As a September ritual, high school seniors will be poring over the new college rankings, released today by U.S. News & World Report . Princeton University, the ivy league school in New Jersey, took the top ranking.

The rankings were compiled after reviewing data from 1,800 institutions. This year the magazine changed it's methodology slightly by decreasing the weight of high school rank, a figure that colleges don't take as seriously anymore. They also increased the weight on graduation and retention rates for national universities and liberal arts colleges. Regional schools were ranked with an increased importance on an institution's predicted graduate rate versus the actual graduation rate. Even with the new changes though, the magazine says that the top schools remained relatively the same. Following Princeton in the top five were the usual suspects of Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Stanford, and the University of Chicago. Only one public school made it into the top 20.

Princeton was also ranked number three in the magazine's list of Best Value Colleges. Since cost is a major factor for students, the magazine drafted that list to help students determine which schools would give them 'the most bang for their buck'. Princeton currently has a 'no loan' policy for students with financial needs. Those students who need help paying for tuition get grants instead of loans. In addition to the main national university rankings, the magazine also puts out various other lists for it's 2014 Best Colleges issue. Other lists include the 'A+ Schools for B Students', 'Best Undergraduate Business Programs', and 'Up-and-Coming Schools'.","After changing the weight on certain criteria, Harvard University dropped to number two this year .

Ms Nyad, 64, said she swam without holding on to any of the boats or people accompanying her. 'I swam. We made it, our team, in squeaky-clean, ethical fashion,' she said. Her critics are suspicious about long stretches of the 53-hour swim where Ms Nyad appeared to have either picked up incredible speed or to have gone without food or drink. Scroll down for video . Water controversy: United States endurance swimmer Diana Nyad talks to the media about her record-setting swim from Cuba to Florida .

'Never give up': Diana Nyad emerges from the Atlantic Ocean after completing a 110-mile swim from Cuba to Key West, Florida . Challenge: John Barlett, right, Nyad's navigator, defended her conduct . Since Ms Nyad finished her swim on . September 2 in Key West, long-distance swimmers have been debating it on . social media and in online forums. Her . speed, at some points more than doubling, has drawn particular . scrutiny. Her team has attributed her speed to the fast-moving Gulf . Stream flowing in her favour. The . athlete and her team held a conference call with some of the sceptics . who questioned her navigator's credentials and observations of the . currents. 'Many of us . are pursuing this as a technical matter,' said kayaker and lawyer . Richard Clifford. 'Having the information out there helps us analyse it, . measure it, test it, smell it, you know, decide if it looks right and . is right, and you guys keep saying it is. So, let us look at it.' GPS: Nyad's navigator said the above 'spot trackers' used by her critics to claim she cheated are not accurate . A helping push: Nyad's claim that she was helped by a particularly swift current towards Key West has been backed up by independent ocean expert Dr Mitchell Roffer . Ms . Nyad's navigator, John Bartlett, said her fastest speed averaged about . 3.97mph over a 5.5-hour period over about 19 miles, crossing the . strongest parts of the Gulf Stream, which was flowing at a favourable . angle. 'What you're seeing . is the combination of the speed of Diana propelling herself in the water . and the speed of the current carrying us across the bottom,' he said. Bartlett said Nyad’s speed and . location can’t be measured by ‘spot trackers’ - that were quoted by the . doubters - were simply estimating Niyad’s location for public viewing . and nothing more. He told MailOnline: ‘Those spot trackers are for the public to watch Diana swim along. The positions that I have on my GPS are the real positions,' Evan . Morrison, co-founder of the online Marathon Swimmers Forum, says it . will be interesting to compare observations made by Ms Nyad's navigator . with publically available data about the currents she swam. Ms . Nyad attempted the swim from Cuba to Florida four times before finally . completing the journey on her fifth attempt, making her the first to . make it without the aid of a shark cage. Secret weapon: This is Nyad's first attempt using the prosthetic face mask custom-made to shield her from the paralyzing stings of the box jellyfish, which some fellow swimmers consider to be cheating . She . did follow a streamer dangled in the water by her team and used a . specialised mask and bodysuit to protect herself from venomous . jellyfish, which are considered a more serious threat than sharks in . those waters. Some members of the marathon swimming communities say . these methods were against the traditions of her sport. Nyad wore a full non-neoprene bodysuit, . gloves, booties and a silicone mask at night, when jellyfish are a . particular problem, and removed the suit once she got over the reef on . her approach to Key West. Close to shore: Diana Nyad pictured about two miles out from shore in the Florida Keys. Her critics feel that there is a chance she got out of the water and went on board the accompanying boat . More than just encouraging words? Some other swimmers say that an uptick in her speed mid race implies that she may have gotten a boost of oxygen from her team . An oceanographer not affiliated with Nyad's team said the swimmer couldn't have picked a more perfect current to get from Havana to Key West. Dr. Mitch Roffer of Roffer's Ocean Fishing Forecasting Service Inc. based in Melbourne, Fl. said he got an email questioning whether Nyad's swim was a hoax, so he decided to look at the charts for himself. What he saw convinced him that she could do it. ‘It was like a walking sidewalk heading to Key West and then got off it ,’ Roffer told MailOnline. ‘I looked at the GPS locations and they all seem to be correct. She got great benefit from the current.’ Janet Hinkle, a Key West boat captain and acquaintance of Nyad's, was called to be an observer for the swim when Steve Munatones, a former U.S. national open-water coach, was unable to make it. 'I can say unequivocally she swam every stroke without question,' Hinkle said. Exhausted: The grandmother appeared to he covered in salt after the length of time she spent in the water . Critics have said Hinkle was too close to Nyad to be an independent observer of her swim. Hinkle has in the past helped Nyad by providing housing for her when the swimmer stayed in the Florida Keys, but she said she remained on the periphery of Nyad's team. 'I think anyone who knows me knows me as a person of high integrity. I believe that's why Diana asked me, and I took my job very seriously,' Hinkle said. 'She was giving her all and I would give her my best.' Since none of the various open-water swimming associations dictate how someone should swim from Cuba to Florida - officially accomplished only by Nyad and Susie Maroney, who used a shark cage - Nyad just had to follow generally accepted rules about not getting out of the water or using equipment such as fins.","Diana Nyad denies that she ever held onto the support boat during the feat .

This image shows Simon Halford-Thompson chatting to a friend - just seconds before the car hit him . The car can then be clearly seen careering into the takeaway . A split-second later the Mercedes, with a drunk-driver at the wheel, crushes Simon at the counter . It's a chaotic scene, with debris everywhere and the takeaway worker cowering in shock . Simon was lucky not to lose the use of his legs after they were shattered in the accident, but he's now on the mend and making a good recovery at home . Simon, who was in China teaching English as a foreign language at the time of the incident in January 2012, was in hospital for seven months. He had a cage surrounding his legs, which were held together with metal rods and plates. Overcoming the trauma, Simon was determined to get back on his feet and playing football. Simon spent seven months in hospital after the accident, with metal rods and plates holding his legs together . ‘There was some anxiety when one doctor suggested the bottom of one of my legs might have to be amputated. ‘There was never too much worry about me being able to walk again. I took the view the accident had happened so there was not much I could do and there was no use moping around.’ Simon said: ‘I had lots of support from friends in China. My mum and sister wanted to come out to see me straight away but I thought it was better for them to wait until I got out of hospital. ‘When I got out it was fantastic to see them. I did not want to leave China. I did not want the experience to blight the great time I had there. I was only going to leave on my terms.’ The drink-driver was locked up for three months after admitting the offence, which was described as ‘stupid and negligent but not deliberate’. The front of the McDonald's where the shocking accident happened . Simon is now aiming to get a teaching job in Europe. He has enjoyed playing cricket since he returned home and is also keenly following his favourite football team, Manchester United. He said: ‘I want to thank my family and friends for their support.’ Simon is a graduate of the University of Leeds, where he studied international history and politics. He said his aim to teach English as a foreign language was a way to see the world. In China, he first taught in Sichuan near the Tibetan border before moving to Jiangsu in the east of the country. He had taught at the school for about three months before the crash.","Simon Halford-Thompson is resting at home after both legs were shattered .

Many medical breakthroughs - including those that unearthed Viagra, Quinine and Botox - have been made completely by accident, while scientists were searching for cures for another ailment entirely. And it's happened again, this time when researchers at Cambridge University were looking for a cure for liver damage and accidentally created a cream they feel certain will be a powerful anti-ageing product. MitoQ - which claims to soften the skin while lightening and actually reversing the signs of ageing - is a patented blend of unique ingredients, which scientists Mike Murphy and Rob Smith stumbled across while trying to find a cure for liver disease. Scientists have discovered an anti-ageing cream while looking for a cure for liver damage . The pair's work culminated in the . discovery of a delivery system that floods cells with antioxidants - . health-giving molecules that inhibit oxygenation of cells - straight . into the mitochondria, the source of free radicals, which are . responsible for ageing and tissue damage. Dr . Michael Murphy explains: 'Mitochondria are like batteries that provide . the energy that all of our cells need to operate and stay healthy, . including skin cells. 'Unfortunately this process also releases free radicals, which actually damage our cells. 'Antioxidants . are the body’s natural defense mechanism to combat free radicals, but . ageing happens because as we get older our bodies produce fewer . antioxidants and can’t fight free radicals as effectively. This is what . causes wrinkles and lines to appear.' The . team claims: 'This is a major scientific breakthrough that enhances our . natural antioxidant capacity restoring our cells to optimal function.' How MitoQ works on ageing skin . The MitoQ cream, left, and Dr Mike Murphy from Cambridge University, right, one of the scientists who made the discovery . Viagra was discovered while looking for angina medicine . Viagra began as a new treatment for angina, a heart condition that constricts the vessels that supply the heart with blood. But when drug company Pfizer searched for something to relax blood vessels, the trials were disappointing. Then, suddenly, trial volunteers began reporting the unusual side effect of erections. Before the launch of Viagra in 1998 there was no oral treatment for erectile dysfunction, the only options were an injection or a prosthetic implant. Ritalin was meant to cure adult depression . Methylphenidate - commonly known as Ritalin, a drug used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, ADHD - was only discovered by accident 50 years ago to treat adults with depression. Even now new uses are being found for the drug. Scientists have found that Ritalin can also work as a cognitive enhancer, and if a person without ADHD takes it, it can make them brighter, boosting concentration and cognition. Quinine, a remedy for malaria, was found in the Andes . History credits a South American Indian with being the first to find a medical application for quinine, after he accidentally ingested it while suffering a malarial fever in a jungle high in the Andes. Desperately thirsty, he drank water from a pool beside a cinchona tree, whose bark indigenous people knew as quina-quina, and was thought to be poisonous. His fever subsided and he brought news of the miracle tree back to his tribe, which began to use its bark to treat malaria. Botox was discovered while hunting for a cure for eye-twitching . Dr Alastair Carruthers and his wife Jean discovered Botox in 1987 in his Vancouver dermatology practice. Alastair split his time between surgery for skin cancer and cosmetic procedures. He also shared his office with Jean, an eye doctor who treated pediatric disorders as well as adult conditions such as blepharospasm, an uncontrollable blinking and spasming of the eye and surrounding area. The ailment was treated with a dilute solution of botulinum toxin, which temporarily paralyzes the spasming muscles. One day a patient remarked that the injections seemed to cure spasming and also diminish wrinkles between eyes known as glabellar lines. The couple took their discovery to conferences and Botox is now used all over the world.","MitoQ 'softens skin .

A 5,000-year-old human skull in 'fabulous' condition has been discovered on the banks of a river in Worcershire by a walker who thought it was a coconut. Experts said the piece of ancient skull is an 'exceptional find' as the intricate marks from blood vessels are still visible on the inner surface. The smooth dark outer side gives only a tantalising glimpse as to what the person may have looked like, although there are 'tentative' suggestions it may have belonged to a woman in middle age living in the Neolithic period - around the time Stonehenge was built. Remarkable discovery: Nick Daffern, senior archaeologist with Worcestershire Archaeology holds the 5,000-year-old skull which has baffled experts . Signs: The upper piece of skull's grey appearance indicated it was from ancient times. Carbon dating confirmed it is about 5,000 years old . The skull is not only prompting questions about the person it belonged to, but where it may have come. A dog walker first stumbled across the skull piece, which is about 15cms (6ins) in length and 10cm (4ins) in width, earlier this year but initially thought it was a ball or a coconut shell. Detectives from West Mercia Police investigated the scene and contacted experts at Worcestershire Archaeology, who sent the skull to be radiocarbon dated. 'When I first saw the skull, I thought it may have been Anglo-Saxon or Roman but I knew that it was not recent due to the colour,' said Nick Daffern, senior archaeologist. 'But we were all surprised when the radiocarbon dating put it at between 3,338 BC and 3,035 BC, or about the middle Neolithic period.' 'It is so well preserved, it is unthinkable that this had been in the river for any length of time which begs the question as to where it has come from. 'We know of Roman, Saxon and medieval burials along the river, but this is very rare - it is an exceptional find. Just the beginning: Experts say this find suggests there is an ancient burial site near the site of the skull by the Avon river in Worcestershire . 'What it suggests is that we have a Neolithic burial site very near here - we just don’t know where.' He said: 'I don’t think it was found where the remains were buried, I think we’ve got a riverside burial and then flooding has brought this down the river. The people of the Neolithic, the last part of the Stone Age, were the first farmers in Britain. It was an era of development in human technology when people lived in small tribes. Spanned from 4,000- 2,500 BC. Neolithic societies were more hierarchical than hunter-gatherer cultures in general. Mud brick houses coated with plaster started appearing around this time. The growth of agriculture made permanent houses possible. Doorways were made on the roof, with ladders positioned both on the inside and outside of the houses. The people . cultivated the land, built farmsteads, erected giant stone circles and chambered communal tombs. As recently as May 2012 it was discovered that they were responsible for inventing raving. In gatherings equivalent to the Glastonbury Festival, men of the age would spend several days eating, drinking and dancing. Herds of cattle were slaughtered to provide food and dancing would continue late into the night during the summer months. 'Finding that burial site though would be like finding a needle in a haystack.' Mr Daffern said that without the rest of the skeleton it was difficult to draw conclusions about the person found, and certainly there is no clue as to how they met their death. 'Both myself and a forensic anthropologist believe it is a woman due to the slightness of the skull and the lack of any brow ridges although our conclusions are very tentative because we’re dealing only with the top of a skull,' he added. 'There’s no trauma to the bone, and where it has broken those are natural breaks, nor is there any sign of disease so we’ve no idea as to cause of death. 'The natural fusion of the bone in the skull leads me to believe it may be an older woman, possibly in her 50s, but that is very tentative again. 'Unfortunately, it remains a bit of a mystery.' The find is a few miles from Bredon Hill, which has been a scene of human activity down the ages and still boasts the earthen ramparts of what was an Iron Age hill fort, however finds of Neolithic remains are rare. 'Whenever we come across Neolithic remains, there seems to be a solid dividing line between where they buried their dead, and where they lived and that is no accident,' he said. 'But it is frustrating as an archaeologist because although we have the physical evidence, we still don’t have the answers as to why.' The skull is only the second set of Neolithic remains to be found in the county, although two large 6,000-year-old ‘halls of the dead’ were found in nearby Herefordshire this year but without any human remains present.","Skull is believed to be of a middle aged woman living in 3,300 BC .

Most young adults would rather give welfare payments to pensioners than to the unemployed, a report says. In further evidence that young voters are drifting to the Right, a poll found they are three times more likely to support spending on universal handouts for the elderly than they are on out-of-work claimants. Among those known as Generation Y – born between 1980 and 2000 – almost half old enough to vote chose pensions as a priority for extra government spending, compared with one in six for unemployment benefits. Shift to the right: Most young voters would rather give welfare payments to pensioners rather than the unemployed . The report, by think-tank Demos and pollsters Ipsos Mori, shows a general decline of support for the welfare state among people of all ages. It comes after several reports suggested a hardening of views among today’s youth and a general move to the Right. A study in June found that support for the Tories among Generation Y has doubled from 10 per cent to 20.5 per cent in the eight years since David Cameron became Conservative Party leader. And a poll put Tory backing among the 18 to 24s at 31 per cent, four points ahead of Labour. The Demos report, which draws on the British Social Attitudes annual survey of 3,000 people, suggests that younger voters are particularly Right-wing on welfare. Less worthy? Only one in six of Generation Y voters believe that giving money to the unemployed is a priority . While only a quarter of younger voters said they were proud of the welfare state, 70 per cent of people born before 1948 agreed  it was one of Britain’s proudest achievements. Commentators believe this shows a growing acceptance among those in their 20s and 30s that they should be more self-reliant. Respondents were asked: ‘Which, if any, of these would be your highest or second highest priority for extra spending?’ More support: A study in June found that support for the Tories among Generation Y has doubled in the eight years since David Cameron became Conservative Party leader . They could choose from pensions, child benefits, unemployment benefits, disability benefits and single parent benefits. Generation Y was the only age group to show a decline in support for disability benefits, down three points to 20 per cent since 2007. The three main parties are looking at whether to end universal handouts for older people. These have been ring-fenced following a promise by Mr Cameron not to touch them during the course of this Parliament. Demos deputy director Duncan O’Leary said: ‘A large proportion of the “grey vote” isn’t grey at all. Younger people see pensioners as both vulnerable and deserving – which is why their benefits are still popular. ‘For working-age welfare to achieve the same support, people will need to be reassured not just that the unemployed are needy, but also that they have put into the system.’ Julia Unwin, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: ‘Young people share with their elders a commitment to continuing to support pensioners. 'What worries me is the growing misunderstanding about people claiming benefits, including those who are disabled. ‘We know from research that most people who claim out-of-work benefits want to find a job. Myths about welfare destroy confidence in our system of social security.’","A poll found they are three times more likely to support payments to the elderly .

The unique device called Varibike looks like a regular bicycle, with traditional foot pedals, but additionally comes with a set of cranks that the rider turns with their arms to make it easier and faster when cycling. It was designed by 43-year-old Martin Kraiss, from Ulm in Germany and costs £4,000. Scroll down for video . German cyclist Martin Kraiss, pictured, is shown riding his Varibike design. Varibike looks like a regular bicycle, with traditional foot pedals, but additionally comes with a set of cranks that the rider turns with their arms to make it easier and faster when cycling . The aluminium bike weighs 15kg, costs £4,000 and can be bought in white, black and gold, pictured . The Varibike allows the rider to use their whole body to ride the bike and the person behind the invention is confident it goes faster than regular bicycles. Kraiss said: 'Cycling had always been too one-sided for me as the power only comes from the legs. 'The upper body is static, it gets no exercise and is completely neglected. 'Our objective was to create a bicycle which is driven by the whole body that is even faster than a conventional bicycle.' A recent study by the New Mexico State University found that although the same heart rate is achieved with an arm- and leg-powered drive, the cyclist can achieve 31 per cent more power. In addition, the continuous power output is higher so the overall workout is more effective. The aluminium bike weighs 15kg, costs around £4,000 and can be bought in a one-sized frame in white, black and gold. A recent study by the New Mexico State University found that although the same heart rate is achieved when arm cranks are added to a bicycle, like those on the Varibike, pictured, an arm- and leg-powered drive gives a cyclist 31 per cent more power . Mr Kraiss added: 'Because you have 30 per cent more power it is easier to climb hills and the rider can go faster. 'It is also easier on longer rides as you can use arm and leg drive in varying intensity, allowing individual muscle groups to relax repeatedly while riding. 'It is more fun when you can vary between different cycling styles and alternate by using your arms and legs. 'You have more drive power and you are faster, particularly when climbing hills. 'You can choose to do high intense work out, cardio training or just cruise around. Wherever you go with the Varibike you exercise your whole body.' Kraiss, pictured, said: 'Cycling had always been too one-sided for me as the power only comes from the legs. The upper body is static, it gets no exercise and is completely neglected. Our objective was to create a bicycle which is driven by the whole body that is even faster than a conventional bicycle.' The 43-year-old designer claims the bike wasn't designed solely for pro-cyclists and can also be used by anyone during 'leisure time when cycling with friends and family' Mr Kraiss also revealed he uses it in his spare time and the Varibike hasn't been designed solely for pro-cyclists. 'When you're riding the bike it feels amazing. It's incredible fun powering the Varibike with the whole body. 'I use it when ever I need a transportation device, or in my leisure time when cycling with friends or family.' Kraiss has also designed an indoor version of his Varibike to 'beat the lousy weather.'

BIG supermarkets which put customers at risk from a killer food poisoning bug found on chicken are to be identified on ‘name and shame’ lists. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has announced that it is to carry out regular tests on chicken sold on the high street for the presence of campylobacter. Lists of infection levels will be published in a bid to shame the stores into taking action following years of failure to deliver safe and clean chicken. The bug is the biggest cause of food poisoning in the UK, responsible for an estimated 580,000 cases of illness, 22,000 hospital admissions and 140 deaths. Named and shamed: The Food Standards Agency will carry out regular tests on chickens sold in supermarkets, which have been accused of putting customers at risk of food poisoning . The cost of treating the sickness and lost days of work, quite apart from the human misery, is put at £900million a year. An official study published in 2009 revealed that two in three of all fresh chicken on shelves was contaminated with campylobacter. More than one in four – 27per cent – were classed as being highly contaminated. However, despite the fact the FSA has asked supermarkets and farmers to make combatting campylobacter a top priority, the situation appears to be getting worse with more cases of human infection. The board of the official watchdog today agreed a new action plan that will include carrying out regular supermarket tests and publishing name and shame lists. The watchdog is also investigating new ways to kill the bug before it reaches the high street. These include washing the chicken with lactic acid and flash freezing for a few seconds. Farmers are under pressure to stop the spread of the disease within their flocks, while consumers will be given advice on how to handle and cook chicken. An FSA paper on the food poisoning crisis warned: ‘In addition to the attendant economic costs, cases cause inconvenience, discomfort and misery to those who become infected and a small proportion of cases result in death or long-term consequences, such as reactive arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome and Guillain-Barré syndrome, the latter of which affects the peripheral nervous system.’ Risk: Campylobacter, the bug found in unclean chicken, is to blame for 580,000 cases of illness, 22,000 hospital admissions and 140 deaths in the UK . FSA chief executive, Catherine Brown, told board members urgent action is needed to protect the public. ‘Every week that goes by people are suffering,’ she said. There is an official target to reduce the proportion of chicken that is heavily contaminated from around one in four to one in ten. However, Miss Brown said the target is not tough enough and is the ‘very least’ that is needed to protect families. ‘None of us as consumers would feel comfortable that 10per cent of chicken was in the most contaminated band,’ she said. ‘The chief executive of one of the very big producers said to me the other day, ‘If this bug was turning our chicken green, we would have sorted it out by now’.’ She added that pressure needs to be brought on supermarkets and producers, saying: ‘We have got to create an environment where they are that motivated…we need to create more urgency. ‘This has been treated as a technical issue. We are now saying this is a public health issue, a strategic issue and significant risk to your businesses.’ Board member, Dr Henrietta Campbell, called for tough action saying: ‘Campylobacter needs to be heard loud and clear out there. ‘This is about urgency and about trying to link the incentives and sanctions that will drive the industry to deliver what we need.’ The food director at the British Retail Consortium,  Andrew Opie, insisted that supermarkets are already tackling the problem. ‘Retailers fully support the FSA’s objective to reduce campylobacter and are investing in their supply chains working with farmers and processors to identify effective controls,’ he said. Top priority: Despite the FSA ordering supermarkets and farmers to make combating the bug a top priority, the number of cases keep rising . ‘Measures implemented include introducing leak-proof packaging on all whole birds to control the spread of any contamination and provision of on-pack labelling which advises consumers on how to safely handle and prepare poultry. ‘Consumer messaging is repeated using other channels including websites and in-store magazines.  Campylobacter is completely killed by normal cooking so providing people prepare chicken properly and follow sensible hygiene practices they're at no risk and should not be put off buying an affordable and nutritious meat.’ He added: ‘Campylobacter is a complex organism that is difficult to control, and scientific evidence hasn’t provided an effective solution so far.  The industry is working hard to tackle this shared issue and we require continued support from the Government to achieve this,’ he said.","The Food Standards Agency to 'name and shame' supermarkets putting customers at risk .

On her first night living with her new 'mom', 13-year-old Anna Barnes was asked to sleep in her bed . She found the request weird, and even more so considering the woman was naked. Anna had been sent to live with Nicole Eason and her husband Calvin at their mobile home in Westville, Illinois after her second set of adoptive parents found they could not longer care for her. Scroll down for video . Passed around: Russian orphan Anna Barnes moved to the U.S. when she was 7, but her first set of adoptive parents gave her up to a new couple when she was 11 - Gary and Lisa Barnes . Anna's story came to light in a recent investigation by Reuters and NBC News into the process of 'private re-homing'. It turns out that it is quite easy to pass custody of an unwanted child onto other people - and it's been happening a lot with foreign adoptees. Their investigation found groups on websites like Yahoo and Facebook where adoptive parents advertised their children to be placed in new homes. Since no money is exchanged, most of these people are performing legal transactions not deemed human trafficking. 'This is a bad analogy, but it's sort of like selling a used car,' Gary Barnes told NBC News. 'If you tell someone it breaks down everyday, nobody's going to buy it. Gave her up: Gary and Lisa Barnes took in Anna when she was 11-years-old, but two years alter they were desperate to get rid of the troubled teen who started to get violent towards her adoptive mother . Gary and his wife Lisa took in Anna, an orphan from Russia, after her initial American parents gave her up. 11-years-old by the time that the Barnes took her in, Anna had deep-seeded issues they found impossible to resolve. Anna was diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder and oppositional defiant disorder. She mouthed off at school and even got violent towards Lisa. Eventually, the couple decided they were not the parents for the job and started looking for a willing couple to take Anna in. They met Nicole Eason on a Yahoo group dedicated to re-homing. Taker: The Barnes met Nicole Eason on Yahoo group for child re-homing. She offered to take Anna in and even had a home study test to prove her parenting skills . Through conversations online, Nicole said she would love Anna 'no matter what mistakes she makes in life' and even promised to get the girl a puppy and buy her favorite candy bars. The Barnes were comfortable transferring custody to the Easons when Nicole showed them a home study by a social worked that proved she had the proper parenting skills. Nicole and her husband flew down to Texas in September 2008 and the whole transaction was finalized over dinner at a local chain restaurant. But after having met the Easons, Anna didn't want to go. She says they made her nervous. 'I couldn't stop (crying)...I just kept telling them, ""Please don't send me to them. Please I'm begging you. I will get down on my knees,""' she said. But the Barnes drove off and left Anna to go live with the Easons in Illinois. Her new home was in a mobile park in a small trailer filthy with dog urine  and feces. New home: Anna arrived at her new home and found it riddled with feces and urine. Above, a picture of the Eason's last known residence in Tucson, Arizona . Destroyed: A picture taken on August 23 shows what the couple left behind when they vacated their Tucson trailer . Left behind: The Eason's property manager says he found five dogs left behind in the trailer after the Eason's left . On her first night there, Anna remembers her new mom asking her to pick out a movie to watch from the couple's collection where she found pornography. That night she was told to come and sleep with Nicole in bed and found that her adoptive mom was naked. She says she felt her kissing her throughout the night . On a following night she was again asked to join the couple in bed, this time to sleep between them, but Anna eventually refused. 'I was sandwiched in there, and I stayed there for about a total of 2 minutes, 47 seconds, and decided that it was getting weird,' she said. According to the investigation, Nicole Eason took in re-homed children six times. Above, Nicole and Calvin pose with Quita Puchalla, a Liberian teenager they took in before she was taken away from them and sent back to her original adoptive parents . After that she went and slept on the couch. Thankfully, Anna's time with the Easons was short lived. A few days later, when she was at her new school she saw a familiar face in the hallway - that of Gary Barnes, the dad who had given her up. One of Nicole's former friends called the Barnes and told them she believed the Eason's home study was a fake - and it was. She also told them that at least one of the children they got through re-homing was taken away from them and that she feared for Anna's safety. Pedophile: Nicole Eason had taken in children with Randy Winslow who is currently serving a 20-year-sentence for sending and receiving child pronography . He flew all the way up to Illinois to bring her back to Texas. Back home, The Barnes filed a complaint against the Easons through the Texas Attorney General's office but so far authorities in Illinois and Texas have taken no steps to prevent the Easons from continuing to adopt. According to the investigation, the Easons have taken in children through re-homing six times.

The mother of a 16-month-old girl has demanded a dog be destroyed after it bit her daughter so hard it left a tooth embedded in her cheek. Lexi McCaffery was left with four puncture wounds, a split lip and a burst vein when she tried to cuddle the seven-year-old Japanese Akita.

Cleared: Michael Le Vell enjoyed a pint to mark being cleared of 12 child sex charges . Michael Le Vell's unstable life off-screen could have been a storyline written for any soap. His trial laid bare a 'troubled man' who chain-smoked, drank up to 12 pints a night, had a string of one-night stands and even an affair with a younger woman while his wife had cancer treatment. But the 48-year-old Coronation Street actor, who made his name playing mechanic Kevin Webster for 30 years, told the jury at Manchester Crown Court that his ‘little dark secrets’ did not mean he was a paedophile. As Le Vell walked free from court after being found not guilty of raping and sexually assaulting a girl from the age of six, ITV bosses said they were preparing to discuss his return to the soap. Commenting after the verdicts, a spokesman for Coronation Street said: 'We are looking forward to meeting with Michael to discuss his return to the programme.' During the trial, Le Vell's barrister admitted his client was a 'drunk and a bad husband' whose . behaviour was sometimes 'terrible', but he is not a child rapist. Like his character, whose love for the Rover's Return was well-known, Le Vell admitted he 'went out every night because I’m working class' and told of two failed attempts to grapple with his heavy drinking at Alcoholics Anonymous. The actor often drank seven or eight pints a night but on occasions he would down 12 pints. But despite his alcoholism, he still managed to work for 30 years as one of Britain's best known soap stars. He told the court he would go to the pub most nights of the week, especially if he had been filming Coronation Street. He said: ‘I’m a bloke, after work I’m going to go and wind down for an hour or two. I know it sounds chauvinistic - that’s the way I was brought up unfortunately.’ Born in Newton Heath, Manchester, he was one of six siblings in a working class family. Three of his sisters - one has died - and his brother sat in the public gallery during the trial to give their support. Scroll down for video . Return: ITV bosses have said they are preparing to discuss his return to the soap . Evidence: Le Vell's trial revealed 'dark secrets' of hard-drinking and a string of affairs behind his wife's back, even when she was having chemotherapy . His mother died from a brain tumour when he was 15 and his father from lung cancer when he was 22. Le . Vell said he became involved in acting aged 12 after playing a part in a . school production of Kes - earlier made famous by Ken Loach's film . portrayal. It led to a . stint at Oldham Theatre Workshop, which has also produced star actresses . Anna Friel and Suranne Jones, and performances at the town's Coliseum . Theatre. In the early days of his career he also worked in a men's boutique and as a plasterer's labourer. His . big break came when he won the part of Kevin Webster after auditioning . following another role on the soap, as Neil Grimshaw, a newspaper . delivery boy who worked at The Kabin. He . first appeared as Webster in the soap on October 19 1983, moving in . with Hilda Ogden as her lodger and getting a job as an apprentice . mechanic with Brian Tilsley. Le . Vell has featured in some of Coronation Street's most explosive . storylines, most recently Webster's affair with Molly Dobbs, which . apparently made him consider quitting the soap. Famous: After three years in the soap, Kevin Webster married wife Sally in 1986 (left) and their at times stormy marriage and family life has captured the country's imagination . for decades . Controversial: Webster's affair with Molly Dobbs in 2009 finally cost him his on-screen marriage, and at the time it was reported that he was considering quitting the soap despite having the 'best job in the world' Drama: Kevin Webster confronts Sally and Tyrone Dobbs in the street as Rosie Webster looks on, after Sally punished Kevin for having an affair by having one of her own in 2011 . During the 1980s he became something of a gay icon and would receive a high volume of fan mail from gay men. This was reportedly due to the fact he wore tight jeans and a moustache and appeared on screen with his left ear pierced. He later claimed that the attention from gay men ended as soon after he shaved off his facial hair. He . has been much-loved by fans who have followed the trials and . tribulations of Kevin, particularly through to his stormy marriage to . Sally, played by Sally Dynevor, and fathering two teenage girls as well . as a child from an affair. The . Websters finally called time on their marriage after Molly Dobbs, played by . Vicky Binns, confessed to Sally that Kevin was her baby’s father as she . lay dying in hospital following the street’s famous tram crash. In . real life he married Coronation Street co-star Janette Beverley in . October 1986. They couple have two children together but split in 2010. This year Le Vell reportedly dated Emma Dodd, 28, after his split from his wife. He then went on to date Chilean mother-of-four Blanca Fouche. Stalwart: Michael Le Vell, real name Michael Turner, has been in the ITV soap since 1983 and is one of the country's biggest soap stars, and like his character, it has emerged how much he enjoys a drink . Although . the actor has not filmed any scenes for the ITV soap since he was . charged earlier this year, he has not been officially suspended as bosses were reportedly . waiting on the outcome of the trial. Le Vell pledged to carry on playing Kevin Webster because he still viewed it as 'the best job on television'. It was reported that he would be offered a new £250,000 contract to stay with the ITV soap if he was cleared. His life on Coronation Street, at . times, had remarkable similarities, where he had a series of affairs . behind the back of hard-pressed wife Sally and also went on a series of . drinking binges. Eleanor . Laws QC, prosecuting, suggested that in real life Le Vell drank so . often and regularly because he was ashamed of the sexual abuse he had . allegedly committed. She asked the actor: ‘Are you a troubled man? Because something was troubling you... to go out every night?’ Le Vell, pictured with his wife Janette Beverley, who he split with last year .

Laws said: ‘I suggest that at times when you were sober you were . finding it difficult to live with yourself. This abuse started, you just . could not stop yourself.' Le . Vell told the jury that during his 25-year marriage to his wife he had . had a series of one-night stands when he worked away from home. He said he had been having an affair with Olivia Wallis, 32, at the same time as his wife was receiving chemotherapy for cancer. He said his 25-year marriage had been ‘crumbling’ and he had sought comfort in the arms of a close friend and ‘confidante.’ The jury was also told of a conversation which he had with someone last year about ‘secrets’ and he also agreed telling the same person that what he had done was ‘something unforgiveable’. In . trying to prove his innocence the star was forced to reveal all about . his personal problems and said the allegations against him left him . 'fighting for his life'. He . said the girl, who claimed she was raped at the age of six, nine and . ten, was 'seriously deluded, I’m sorry. What can I say, she’s telling a . pack of lies.

Researchers found that two thirds of those surveyed believe that the structure of private and state schools is the cause of social divisions. Almost the same number of those questioned also felt that a private education gives children from wealthier backgrounds an 'unfair advantage', according to the study of more than 2,000 people by the Challenge Network.

Anthony Seldon, master of Wellington College, a private school for 13 to 18-year-olds, said: 'The current school system in the UK does effectively nothing to diminish segregation in our society. 'The limited mixing and interaction between those that attend private and state schools helps fuel a social apartheid that has gone unaddressed for too long. 'We have a responsibility to future generations to bridge our two-tier education system and work towards ending our class division to mutual benefit.

And more than 70 per cent said they thought private school pupils would benefit from mixing with people from other schools. Less than half felt that private education made a positive contribution to the UK economy, with more than a third claiming that private schools stand in the way of social mobility. Craig Morley, chief executive and co-founder of the Challenge Network, said: 'The relationships people form in their school years have a defining impact on their lives. 'The lack of interaction between pupils from private and state schools is leading to worryingly high levels of segregation. 'It is crucial that young people are given opportunities to spend time and share experiences with people that are different to themselves.

He is reminiscing the day doctors tested him to see whether his bone marrow was compatible with that of his twin brothers, Jordan and Josh Buchanan, 16. The identical twins have sickle-cell anemia, a hereditary disease that affects the red blood cells, and have been suffering through a life of pain every day since they were born. Twin brothers Jordan and Josh Buchanan, left, were both born with sickle-cell anemia, a hereditary disease that affects red blood cells. Brother Jonathan, right, was not . In June 2012, doctors tested the twins’ three other siblings, including Jonathan, to determine if they were a match and found that the two eldest brothers were not able to donate, according to the Arizona Republic. But the day came when the boys’ mother, Kristine Buchanan, 44, got the phone call that would change their lives: Jonathan was a perfect match. ‘I was sitting down with a cup of coffee when I got the call, and I just started crying. I didn’t know what to feel,’ Ms Buchanan said. ‘I was like, is this for real?’ ‘I had a feeling when my two other brothers were tested and couldn’t do it (that) it would be me,’ said Jonathan. An apple a day: While the twins have three brothers, 2012 testing showed that only brother Jonathan was a donor match.The teenagers would be saved by their younger brother . Only one son at a time could receive the transplant, so the boys played paper, rock and scissors to see who would go first. Josh won, but Dr Dorothea Douglas, who treats the twins at Phoenix Children's Hospital, decided he should go first anyway, because he was in more pain. A day before the transplant, Jonathan had to spend the day in an operating room to have the marrow taken from his pelvis. More...

But . it got easier once they told me about it. I feel really proud to help . them get better.’ Josh had his transplant in October 2012, and doctors say he is now cured of the disease. ‘I watched his face change from someone who is angry and always feels pain to someone who is happy,’ Jordan told the Arizona Republic. Sickle cell anemia causes the boys to live in chronic pain. They played rock paper scissors to decide who would go first, and Josh won. He was also in more pain. Josh received a transplant with his brother's marrow in 2012 and is now cured . The brothers, seen here with their mother Kristine Buchanan, are now in the last phase of treatment. Jonathan bravely had more bone marrow extracted last month and last week brother Jordan received his transplant at Phoenix Children's Hospital . Sickle-cell anemia is a hereditary disease that changes the shape of red blood cells, making them curved, so they cannot deliver oxygen and nutrients as well as normal cells. In the United States, 70,000 to 100,000 people have sickle-cell anemia, most of them African-Americans, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services. Sickle-cell anemia has caused the boys a lot of pain because the misshaped cells become stuck and can’t move through the body. The average lifespan for someone with the disease is 35-40 years, Dr Douglas said. The disease also makes the boys sensitive to changes in temperature and elevation and prone to strokes, joint trouble, organ problems and other illnesses. ‘The quality of life can be poor,’ Douglas said. ‘You’re in pain every day for the rest of your life.’ Life-long suffering: The twins, Jordan and Josh Buchanan, 16, have been in and out of hospital since they were born . Jordan said his pain is mostly in his neck and head, and it feels like there is something sharp in his head or a bone is out of place. Last week, Jonathan donated bone marrow again, this time for Jordan’s transplant. He said he would donate his marrow a million times, if it would make his brother better. Jordan began his stay at Phoenix Children’s Hospital on August 25 and will stay for six to 10 weeks. He slept through most of the nine-hour transplant on September 5. His hospital room has a TV, an Xbox 360, a MacBook, toys and a stationary bike to keep him busy during the stay. ‘This whole process is utterly a blessing,’ Ms Buchanan said. ‘I’m so grateful for the doctors and nurses at Phoenix Children’s Hospital. They make us feel so welcome.’ Jordan will spend several weeks in the hospital as the new bone marrow multiplies and his immune system recovers from the chemotherapy. It can take up to 10 days for his body to accept the marrow. Dr Douglas said Jordan will be uncomfortable as his body recovers, but it will be worth it, because ‘not having pain every day is a real life-changer’. Jordan is excited and said he is ‘ready for my cells to multiply so I can go home and get back to my friends and family’. Ms Buchanan will stay with Jordan during the entire treatment; she’s sleeping on a reclining chair in the corner of Jordan’s room, and his brothers will visit often, according to the Arizona Republic. Jordan will also have to be weaned off the painkillers, just as his brother was. Dr Douglas said after taking narcotics like Vicodin or Oxycontin their whole lives, they cannot stop taking the medicine cold turkey.

The troubled High Speed Rail project has hit the buffers again after it emerged the man in charge of championing it has been forced to take three weeks off work with a bad leg. As David Cameron ordered a 'fightback' to rescue the £42billion scheme from a growing opposition, its chairman Douglas Oakervee has torn a calf muscle and will be absent from work as the first legislation is introduced to Parliament. The revelation added to the mounting sense of chaos around the project as it enters a critical stage. Scroll down for video . Fast route: The scheme plans to use 225mph trains to link London with Birmingham and other major northern cities . Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin . will today launch a fresh defence of the HS2 project, . highlighting a report claiming that it will boost the UK economy by . £15billion. In his bid to . keep the flagship policy alive, he will say it . is as vital as a ‘heart bypass’ for the clogged arteries of Britain’s . overcrowded railways. In a . combative speech, the he will highlight new . analysis by top City accountants showing that the true benefits of the . Y-shaped HS2 line linking the capital to the Midlands and the North . could boost the UK economy by £15billion a year – with regions gaining . ‘at least double’ the benefit of London. The . accountants say it provides ‘hard evidence’ that HS2 will pay for . itself within a few years putting the Government’s case ‘beyond . reasonable doubt.’ Staunch supporter: Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin will defend the Government's controversial HS2 rail scheme in a speech today . Ministers say the previous Whitehall cost-benefit analysis failed to take account of the full benefits to the regions which the new KPMG study has addressed. But the Taxpayers’ Alliance said the minster was simply getting sharp accountants to dress up the figures in a ‘propaganda exercise’ based on ‘dodgy assumptions in the Government’s own business case’  to protect an expensive and unnecessary  ‘white elephant’. Mr Oakervee as previously warned that it would be 'catastrophic' for the country if the project did not go ahead. But according to The Independent, there was already concern that he was not doing enough to publicly support it. The news that his leg injury will mean he is away from work for three months will only add to the sense of a lack of leadership. 'Captain Invisible gets even more time hiding in his garden,' one industry source told the newspaper, referring to a nickname given to Mr Oakervee by his critics. Today’s speech by Mr McLoughlin marks the official start of a Government ‘fightback’ against detractors including residents blighted by the line, MPs, taxpayer and protest groups, who say it’s a waste of money. Controversy has dogged the 351 mile scheme which is planned to run through leafy Tory heartlands in Warwickshire and Buckinghamshire using 225mph trains to link London to Birmingham and beyond to Manchester and Leeds. On . Monday a damning report by the powerful Commons’ Public Accounts . Committee said ministers had failed to make a ‘value for money’ case for . the scheme whose costs were ‘spiralling’. The . spending watchdog said the Government’s case was based on ‘fragile . numbers, out-of-date data and assumptions which do not reflect real . life’. And it feared it would simply ‘suck’ more money into London . rather than benefit the regions. But in his keynote speech today, Mr McLoughlin will argue that only a new high speed rail line will reduce worsening overcrowding on the railways and that the alternative of an upgrade to the already stretched West Coast Main Line would be like ‘trying to run the M1 up the Old Kent Road’. He will hail HS2 as ‘our chance to level the playing field between North and South’. Highlighting new research published by City accountants KPMG on the economic benefits of the scheme, he will say: ‘High Speed Two will make Liverpool stronger. Manchester stronger. Leeds stronger. 'Britain stronger - a £15 billion annual boost to the economy - with the north and midlands gaining at least double the benefit of the South.’ KPMG accountants calculate that the boost to Birmingham's economy will be equivalent to between 2.1 per cent to 4.2 per cent of the city region's economic output (Gross domestic product or GDP). Anger: The scheme has attracted much opposition particularly in the rural areas that the line will run through . There will be between 0.8 per cent and 1.7 per cent benefit to Manchester, 1.6 per cent for Leeds and 0.5 per cent for Greater London. The Exchequer could also benefit from £5billion a year in extra tax receipts as a result of the boost to the economy, says the KPMG report. It adds that the vexed debate about the ‘lap-top’ effect on the value of time saved on rail journeys is ‘a red herring’. Passionate: David Cameron has expressed his full support for the scheme in the face of an 'unholy alliance' of opposition . Mr McLoughlin has already admitted that the Government ‘got it wrong’ when making speed and faster journey times the biggest selling-point for HS2, and should have concentrated on benefits. To critics who complain of a spiralling budget he will hit-back:’Let me spell it out. The budget for HS2 is £42.6 billion. Not £70 billion. Not £80 billion. Not the scare stories from opponents. But £42.6 billion. 'And that is an upper limit with a £14.4billion contingency in reserve which we are determined to bear down on.’ He believes the report provides the ‘hard evidence’ needed to convince sceptics. Richard Threlfall, KPMG's head for infrastructure, building and construction said his firm's analysis ‘shows beyond reasonable doubt that HS2 brings net benefits to the country of many times the scheme's cost’. He added: 'The UK will be £15 billion a year better off with HS2, recovering the cost of the scheme within just a few years.' But Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said it was ‘an expensive propaganda exercise’ adding: ‘The Government has squandered taxpayers’ money on a cynical attempt to win over the many, many people who think this white elephant is the wrong way to spend tens of billions of pounds of their money.’ Prime Minister David Cameron has expressed ‘passionate’ support for HS2 in the face of an ‘unholy alliance’ of sceptics. Vocal: Alistair Darling, left, has spoken out against HS2 despite first approving it as Chancellor, while Labour shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle has said the Government must redouble its efforts to make HS2 a reality . High profile critics have included Labour's Alistair Darling who first approved it as chancellor, and the Institute of Directors which dismissed it as ‘a grand folly’. But Labour has given conditional support to HS2 providing costs are capped. Shadow transport Secretary Maria Eagle said: ‘The Government must now redouble their efforts to make the new north-south rail line a reality and ensure it remains on budget and on track.’","HS2 chairman Douglas Oakervee will be absent from work as just as David Cameron orders ministers to launch a 'fightback'

Burglars should be given longer prison sentences because 'numerous' criminals just re-offend while on parole, one of Britain's top judges said today. Michael Stokes QC said offenders were being granted parole well before they served half of their sentences and used that time to commit further crimes. The outspoken senior judge, who sits at Nottingham Crown Court, said multiple offenders should be treated in the same way as sex offenders and violent criminals. His Honour Judge Stokes QC believes multiple offenders like Philip Kelly, left, should be treated in the same way as sex offenders and violent criminals . He is now demanding the courts are given the option of handing out extended sentences - which currently only apply to serious crimes - to repeat burglars. Judge Stokes called for guidelines to be altered to give him powers to jail criminals for longer if they had more than five or six burglaries on their record. He said: 'Dwelling house burglaries are always serious, especially when the offence is committed at night when the householder is asleep in bed. 'In such cases there is always the risk of confrontation taking place. 'In my experience, offenders who commit such offences not infrequently continue to offend after being released from prison. Notthingham Crown Court, where outspoken senior Judge Michael Stoke sits . 'I have seen numerous cases of defendants with five, six or seven previous convictions for dwelling house burglary. 'It is a matter of concern that there have been occasions when such individuals have been granted temporary parole from prison, well before they have served even one half of their sentences, and use that period of release to commit further burglaries.' The Labour Government introduced a 'three strikes and you're out' policy on domestic burglary with mandatory three-year custodial sentences on the third conviction. But sentences are often reduced if the defendant pleads guilty and often they are released after serving just half their sentence. Judge Stokes, the Midlands' most senior member of the judiciary, is calling for multiple offenders to be forced to apply for parole before being released. His comments come after Philip Kelly, 33, who had 46 previous convictions burgled a house after leaving prison. Kelly, of no fixed address, was released on parole just 13 months into a four-year sentence but committed several serious burglaries and failed to return to prison. He was finally jailed for five years on June 25 this year to run consecutively to the four-year sentence originally imposed in 2012. Nottinghamshire Police Inspector Nick Waldron said he believes burglars should serve more of their first sentence to act as a deterrent. He said: 'It's difficult to say whether releasing a repeat burglar will result in a spike in burglaries. 'We have an integrated offender management team that manage repeat offenders so the possibility of re-offending is something we are aware of but we do manage it and it has proved successful. 'However, I would like to see harsher sentencing. 'If people are committing that many times then that's five or six different victims and burglars should be given the appropriate sentence to reflect that level of impact.' *In 2009 judge Stokes slammed the CPS for taking too long to bring juvenile offenders before the courts.","Judge Michael Stokes QC says multiple offenders should be dealt with in the same way a violent criminals .

In a bizarre twist on the iconic children's TV show, Postman Pat's delivery car has been transformed into a high-speed powerhouse. With a top speed of 101.36mph, it is faster than a Porsche. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The childhood favourite coin-operated ride was bought for £250 from eBay by Leeds-based motor enthusiasts . The little red van has a quicker quarter mile time than supercars such as the Porsche 911 GT3 RS . The 100mph race car started life as a coin-operated arcade ride. But after three motor enthusiasts found the toy on eBay for £250 in 2012, they couldn't resist turning it into one of their fleet. They fitted it with wheels and a 500cc motorbike engine, and took it to the track. The little red van, complete with a toy cat stuck to the back, now has a faster quarter-mile speed than supercars such as the Porsche 911 GT3 RS and Aston Martin V-12 Vanquish. After reaching 101.36mph at York Raceway in May, it has this month been deemed the world's fastest coin-operated ride according to the Guinness Book of Records. Before: The plastic arcade ride was bought on eBay for £250. The trio inserted a 500cc motorbike engine . Tim Armitage, David Taylor and Ben Rushforth built a structure that would fit inside the shell and hold an engine . It is a far cry from Pat Clifton's rickety red truck he drives around a village based on Cumbria's Longsleddale . In the show, which first screened in 1981, Pat Clifton and his black-and-white cat, Jess, are known for trundling around the fictional village of Greendale with the day's mail. Each episode, bumbling Pat gets distracted by a customer's problem and strives, ham-handedly to fix it. In a later series screened in 2004, the BBC's beloved postman was promoted to head of the flashy Special Delivery Service, with a speedy red motorbike. But driven by the cautious and dopey Mr Clifton, it was still relatively slow. It is a far cry from the flashy scenes delighting nostalgic fans on race tracks around the country. In character: Ben Rushforth wore a blue racing suit in the style of Pat Clifton, Greendale's dopey delivery man . The race: Ben Rushforth won the novelty ride a Guinness World Record after reaching 101.36mph in May . Black and white cat: A toy of Jess, Pat's trusty pet, was attached to the back on wheels to complete the van . Winning proof: The all-important documents that won the trio their Guinness World Record this month . Pat Van team Tom Armitage, David Taylor and Ben Rushforth have been trialling creation for months - to hordes of disbelieving onlookers. And with news spreading fast, there are now calls for the Leeds-based group to take it to the States. Mr Armitage, 25, said: 'The Pat Van is probably the most talked about race car in the country at the moment and has even made a huge impact in the USA. 'After an aggressive launch the little Postman Pat Van powered its way to victory. 'We have been up against supercars such as a Porsche 968 and we left it standing, showing the spectators how fast this little van really is.' But, he insists, it requires expert driving to perform at its best: 'There is nobody that could just get in the van and drive it quite like Ben does. Without a driver like Ben the van would not be what it is right now.' Original: The box-like van became iconic when it first hit screens in 1981. Despite recent CGI adaptations which gave Pat a motorbike, they are still not a patch on the new race car . The three members of Pat Van Racing have been interested in drag racing since an early age. They were all just weeks old when they attended their first drag race at York Raceway. Mr Armitage said: 'The idea behind the Pat Van started a couple years ago, but we never actually made a start building the van until mid-2012. We sourced a Postman Pat child’s coin operated ride from eBay for £250 and started to build it. 'All the fabrication and engineering has been carried out by David Taylor and I. Pat 1 is powered by a 500cc single cylinder motorbike engine. 'The build was kept very quiet and very few people knew about the project, but now the Pat Van has become famous-people love it.' The iconic stop-motion children's show was first screened in 1981. It was written by John Cunliffe and directed by Ivor Wood of Paddington Bear and The Magic Roundabout fame. The second series in 1996, after a number of TV specials, introduced Pat's wife, Sara, and six-year-old son, Julian. Set . in the fictional village of Greendale, based on the valley of . Longsleddale in Cumbria, Pat Clifton and his black and white cat, Jess, are problem-solvers. Every episode starts with Pat delivering letters before becoming distracted by a problem.

Ed Miliband today condemned Education Secretary Michael Gove as an 'absolute disgrace' after suggesting families become who use food banks have only their own ‘decisions' to blame. In angry exchanges in the Commons, the Labour leader challenged David Cameron to distance himself from the remarks. And he challenged the Tory frontbench to trying living on £150-a-week. Clash: David Cameron was challenged in the Commons by Labour leader Ed Miliband over the remarks by Education Secretary Michael Gove . Earlier this week Mr Gove argued that people who find themselves . unable to buy essentials, including food and school uniforms have . themselves to blame for being unable ‘to manage their finances’. Mr Miliband said the remarks showed the Government to be out-of-touch with the lives of ordinary people. In an increasingly bitter exchange, Mr Miliband said: 'Here is the reality - you want to give maximum support to millionaires so you give them a tax cut. But it's a different story for those who go to food banks. 'And we know what this Government thinks of people who go to food banks because the Children's Secretary (Mr Gove) said that people who go to food banks only have themselves to blame.' As he faced a heckling from the government benches, Mr Miliband hit back: 'One of the Tory MPs is groaning, it just shows how out of touch this Conservative Party is.' He demanded to know if Mr Cameron agreed with Mr Gove but did not get an answer. Criticism: Education Secretary Michael Gove said some families make the wrong decisions and get into financial trouble . Mr Miliband went on: 'The Prime . Minister neither defended the Children's Secretary's comments, nor . distanced himself from them. Let me just tell you, the Children's . Secretary is an absolute disgrace.' Pointing at the Government . frontbench, he added: 'Let's see any of them try to live on £150 a week . and then we will see what happens. 'We have one million young people out . of work, unemployment up in half the country, millions of people worse . off while millionaires get a tax cut. For the few not the many, you are a . two-nation Prime Minister.' But Mr Cameron said he did not have to . take any lectures from Labour on food banks, telling MPs their use . increased 10 times under the last government. More than half a million people across Britain have turned to food banks to stave off hunger, according to charities. Ministers have previously argued that a surge in demand has in part been fuelled by jobcentre staff being allowed to refer the unemployed to food banks for help. Cuts to benefits, frozen or falling wages and rising living costs have been blamed in part for some people struggling to make ends meet. On Monday Mr Gove was challenged over reports that one in four parents are having to borrow to pay for school uniforms and some food banks were distributing uniforms to struggling parents. He said he had recently visited a food bank in his Surrey Health constituency. But he suggested that many cash-strapped families have brought their problems on themselves. He added: ‘I appreciate that there are families who face considerable pressures. ‘Those pressures are often the result of decisions that they have taken which mean they are not best able to manage their finances. ‘We need to ensure that support is not just financial, and that the right decisions are made.’ Mr Gove was responding to a question from Labour frontbencher Luciana Berger who demanded to know ‘what more can he and his Government do to ensure that no students turn up to school embarrassed because they do not have the right clothes’. Demand: Charities say there has been a sharp increase in people turning to food banks, including this one in Southwark run by Felicia Boshorin . Last night Miss Berger said she was ’appalled’ by Mr Gove’s comments. The Labour Liverpool MP added: ’People I have met are ashamed to have to turn to food banks. ’I vehemently disagree it is because they have mismanaged their finances. ’This Government has got no answer to the millions of parents that are really struggling to get by.’ Citizens Advice Chief Executive Gillian Guy said: ’It is appalling to suggest the rise of food banks is due to poor financial management. Labour frontbencher Luciana Berger . ’It’s a smack in the face to families who are working hard but can’t make ends meet, leaving them with no other option but to turn to food banks to feed their families. ’These comments are completely misjudged.’ Chris Johnes, director of Oxfam's UK Poverty Programme, said: 'Thousands are now turning to food banks, but they do not so out of choice, they do so when they have nowhere else to turn. 'The staggering rise in the numbers of people using food banks is down to failings in the benefit system, too many low paid jobs and rising prices that are dragging huge numbers into poverty.' In May a report by Church Action On Poverty and Oxfam suggested up to half of those seeking help were doing so as a direct result of having benefit payments delayed, reduced or withdrawn. Other factors behind the increase on those using emergency help - the 'hidden hungry' - include rising food prices, unemployment and energy costs. But Energy Secretary Ed Davey told MPs that it was 'completely wrong to suggest that there is some sort of statistical link between the benefit reforms we're making and the provision of food banks'.","Labour leader Ed Miliband seizes on remarks by Tory Education Secretary .

Tragedy: Rhiannon Priestley was hit by 10 vehicles while trying to get help after a crash . A young woman survived a horror car crash only to be tragically killed when she was hit by up to 10 vehicles while trying to get help. Rhiannon Priestley lost control of her car on the M4 near Bristol and veered across two lanes of traffic, before crashing down the verge and into a tree with 'considerable force', an inquest heard. The 20-year-old's black Volkswagon Polo then flipped on to its roof, leaving her with head injuries, on the westbound carriageway near junction 19 on October 13 last year. Records show she may have been on her . mobile phone at the time of the accident and a toxicology report found . evidence of cocaine in her system. About half an hour after coming off the road, the fashion retail assistant pulled herself from the wreckage and walked up the verge, Avon Coroner's Court heard. But it is believed she became disorientated while trying to get help from other drivers on the motorway and ran on to the road. She was struck by two oncoming cars and knocked to the ground. Up to eight other vehicles then ran over Miss Priestley as she lay on the slip road. It is not known which collision caused her death. Miss Priestley had spent the evening with friends in Bath, Somerset. She left at about 8.30pm, with friends believing she was returning to the home she shared with her parents in Batheaston. But CCTV images captured Miss Priestley . driving along the M4 towards Bristol at around midnight. It is not known how fast she was driving. Phone . records show Miss Priestley had a conversation with her boyfriend at 12.08am. The court heard she had argued with him earlier that evening. Police attempts to take a statement from her boyfriend had not been successful, the inquest was told. Pc . David Watson, a collision investigator at Avon and Somerset Police, . said: 'The conversation terminated less than five minutes later. 'Despite repeated calls and text messages, Miss Priestley did not respond. 'CCTV footage shows . Rhiannon at 12.12am travelling in lane three, who then swerved for an . unknown reason and left the carriageway and went on to the grass verge. 'The location of the car and the extent of its damage suggests that it had struck a tree with considerable force.' Blood . was found on the airbag suggesting she suffered head or facial injuries, but managed to escape the wreckage at about 12.44am. Pc Watson added: 'There . was evidence of some injury to her head or face. She exited her car, . probably via the driver door and climbed up the grass verge. 'It . is likely she was going to ask for assistance from other motorists, she . may have been disorientated as she approached the edge of the . motorway.' Miss Priestley  was first 'brushed' by . driver Andrew Maybee in his Vauxhall car, before being hit by Miguel Andrews . in his Daihatsu van at around 12.48am. Fatal: Miss Priestley was travelling along the M4 near junction 19 when she veered off the road . Mr Andrews told the court: 'All of a sudden I saw somebody ran towards the car. It was so fast I didn’t have time to react. 'It just looked as if they were running in panic. It was so quick I couldn’t process what was happening before the impact.' Mr Andrews added he pulled over and saw the front of his vehicle was damaged. Miss Priestley was pushed onto the slip road of the motorway by the force of the collision. Up to eight other vehicles then drove over Miss Priestley, as she lay on the slip road, unable to see her in the darkness. Avon Coroner Maria Voisin said a postmortem examination showed Miss Priestley died from multiple injuries. Toxicology tests found she had 'recent exposure' to cocaine, though it was not possible to establish how much she had taken. There were no traces of alcohol in her system. The coroner recorded a verdict of death by road traffic collision. Speaking outside the court, Miss Priestley’s father Will said the family were devastated by her death. 'The loss of Rhiannon is unbearable We will never understand why Rhi and many other alike are taken,' he said. 'Fortunately for us Rhiannon has three older sisters and our family remains strong. 'But all of us, together with her many friends who sincerely loved her, are still feeling immense pain. 'There were a number of factors which conspired on the night to cause the accident and for whatever reason Rhiannon was not fortunate to get a second chance.'","Rhiannon Priestley, 20, lost control of her car on the M4 last October .

University, said: ‘The academic and extra-curricular experience at university varies widely. ‘With increased tuition fees, it’s never been more important for prospective students to weigh up all the options and make sure they make the right choice for them.’ Figures released by the Higher Education Statistics Agency in March showed that one in ten students - 7.4 per cent - drop out of university. This represents 27,230 students, according to the latest available figures from 2010/11. An Ofsted report published yesterday found that pupils are given ‘narrow’ information about careers at school and rarely told about courses besides ‘gold standard’ A-levels. Inspectors said that students need more information as ‘not everyone wants to do A-levels and go to university’. Vocational training and apprenticeships were ‘rarely promoted effectively’.

These habits grew up when going to university was essentially free. ‘But with the introduction of more realistic tuition fees, students will look much more carefully at where they are going and why they are going to make sure that they are making a good investment.’ He added: ‘Students who too hurriedly sign up for something are more likely to drop out and that will waste their time and money.’","Ofsted report yesterday warned that too many schools are failing to give pupils decent careers advice .

Swipe: Business Secretary Vince Cable is striking a more downbeat tone than the Chancellor . Vince Cable is to rebuke George Osborne for ‘complacency’ over Britain's economic recovery. Amid renewed tensions between the two men, the Business Secretary warned the Chancellor that ministers ‘can't rest on our laurels’. Mr Cable struck a distinctly gloomy tone in contrast to Mr Osborne’s assertion this week that the economy was finally ‘turning a corner’. Lib Dem Mr Cable will use a speech tonight to say that ‘a few quarters of good economic data’ did not mean the country was out of the woods. Instead he argues that while there are the ‘beginnings of a recovery story’, it would not become ‘meaningful’ until there was strong and sustained business investment, which remained well down on pre-crash levels. There also appears to be a Cabinet split over efforts to revive the hosuing market. Mr Osborne has also called for more 95 per cent loan-to-value mortgages which he insisted were not ‘weapons of financial mass destruction’ But Mr Cable warned of the risks of the housing market ‘getting out of control’. In his address to a joint Government/CBI industrial strategy conference at Warwick University, the Business Secretary will say that while there were ‘encouraging’ signs for the economy, there was still further to go. ‘We can't rest on our laurels. The kind of growth we want won't simply emerge of its own volition. In fact, I see a number of dangers. One is complacency, generated by a few quarters of good economic data,’ he will say. ‘It isn't difficult to see evidence of confidence returning, and there are positive trends in production. Taken together with success stories like the car industry and export growth in emerging markets, we have the beginnings of a recovery story. ‘But there are risks, not least the housing market getting out of control. Recovery will not be meaningful until we see strong and sustained business investment - and this is still 13% down on its 2008 peak and, as a share of GDP, is currently the lowest in the G7.’ Upbeat: George Osborne used a speech this week to declare that the British economy is 'turning a corner' Mr Cable will stress that the . improving economic news did not mean that the need for long-term . re-structuring and re-balancing could be forgotten. ‘If we are to turn the British economy . around on a sustainable basis there will have to be relatively rapid . growth of exports and import substitutes,’ he will say. It is a markedly different tone to Mr . Osborne, who yesterday ridiculed Labour opponent Ed Balls for refusing . to admit defeat on the big economic arguments. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has accused Mr Osborne of choking off the economic recovery . Mr Balls was likened to Monty Python’s Black Knight who brushes off losing both arms as ‘just a flesh wound’. Mr Osborne said: ‘He is increasingly like Monty Python’s Black Knight defending that bridge. ‘When unemployment falls he says it’s . but a scratch, when business confidence rises he says I’ve had worse, . the recovery is just a flesh wound. ‘The limbs are falling off his . economic argument and it would be a comedy if it were not for the fact . Labour’s economic policies were a tragedy.’ The government has been bolstered by a . run of positive data which suggests the economy is on course for a . sustained recovery in the run-up to the next election. The respected . OECD think tank last week upgraded its growth forecast. It now expects the UK economy to expand by 1.5 per cent in 2013, up from its prediction of 0.8 per cent issued in May. But Labour’s shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said Mr Cable had delivered an ‘embarrassing slap-down’ to Mr Osborne. However, he insisted that the Lib Dems could not distance themselves from the Chancellor 's economic strategy. ‘It also reminds everyone that you . can't trust a word the Lib Dems say. Vince Cable has supported the . Chancellor's policies which choked off the recovery in 2010,’ he said. ‘Three wasted years of flatlining that . has left families worse off and done long term damage to our economy is . his record and he should take responsibility for it.’","Downbeat Business Secretary warns against 'resting on our laurels'

Fewer than one in five jobs are now taxpayer-funded in a boost for David Cameron’s claim to a private sector-led recovery. New figures reveal has public sector employment has fallen 104,000 in a year to 5.67 million, equivalent to 19 per cent of all jobs – the lowest level since records began 14 years ago. By contrast there are 380,000 more private sector workers than a year ago, taking the total number to a record high of 24.17 million. New figures from the Office for National Statistics show how in the last decade public sector jobs have fallen from 5.9million to 5.7million . Mr Cameron seized on the figures in Prime Minister’s Questions as proof the government’s economic plan is working, pointing out that there are now 1.4million private sector jobs than when the coalition was formed. It means that 81 per cent of all workers are now employed by private firms. The Office for National Statistics said today that in June 2013 there were 5.67 million people employed in the public sector, down 34,000 in March this year. At the same time the number of private sector employees hit 24.17 million, up 114,000 from in March. The proportion of people employed by the state, including in schools, hospitals and local government, peaked at 22.1 per cent at the end of 2009, as the last Labour government sought to shield the public sector from the impacts of the financial crash. Speaking in the Commons today, Mr Cameron said: ‘Unemployment is now lower than it was at the general election, and the number of new net private sector jobs, which we have said was 1.3 million, is now 1.4 million, which is very welcome.’ And he turned his fire on the Labour party’s repeated opposition to the government’s economic plan. Mr Cameron said: ‘The Opposition told us that there would be no growth without plan B. Well, we have growth. They told us that unemployment would go up, not down. ‘They told us that growth of private sector jobs would never make up for the loss of public sector jobs.' The unemployment rate now stands at 7.7 per cent, down from a peak of 8.4 per cent two years ago . Prime Minister David Cameron hailed the employment figures, with Chancellor George Osborne (centre) looking on . The PM went on: ‘They have been wrong on every single one of those issues. ‘Of course we need to do more to help with living standards, but the only way to help with living standards sustainably is to deliver growth in the economy, and we are; to keep interest rates and mortgage rates low, and we are; and to cut people’s taxes by raising the personal allowance. ‘All the things this Government have done; things his Government would never do.’ The number of women in work for May to July 2013 was 13.89 million, 318,000 higher than five years previously. ‘This increase in female employment over the last five years was almost entirely due to part-time employment,’ the ONS said. The number of people claiming . Jobseeker's Allowance fell in August by 32,600 from July to 1.4 million, . today’s figures also showed. While overall employment levels have risen in the last five years, it is almost entirely due to people taking part-time jobs . While the CPI rate of inflation is running at more than 2.5 per cent, wages rose by just 1.1 per cent last month . July's claimant count was also revised lower, and the combined 68,900 fall in claimants in July and August was the biggest two-month drop since June 1997. But the continued squeeze on household incomes was highlighted by a 1.1 per cent increase in average weekly earnings between May and July versus a year earlier. Labour leader Ed Miliband told MPs that the only month wages had risen under the Coalition was the month when bankers delayed their bonuses to take advantage of the cut in the 50p top rate of tax. He added: ‘We are in the middle of the slowest recovery in 100 years.’","Public sector jobs falls by 104,000 in a year to 5.67million, ONS says .

Promise: Jeremy Hunt has pledged £500million will help boost cover at understaffed A&E units . The number of senior doctors working in A&E at night is to be boosted after the Daily Mail revealed there are only five across all of England. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said a portion of the £500million being given to hospitals over the next two years to ease A&E pressures would go towards paying consultants to work out-of-hours. At nearly all A&E units in England consultants go home between 8pm and midnight, leaving patients in the hands of junior doctors supervised by one or two more experienced medics. The Mail revealed yesterday that only five NHS trusts in England employ a consultant to work after midnight in their casualty department. Although there is a designated on-call consultant who can be contacted in an emergency after they have gone home, Mr Hunt accepted this system needed to be ‘beefed up’. He told Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘About a quarter of the £500million the Prime Minister announced is going towards increasing consultant cover.’ Labour suggested the problem could be eased by allowing hospitals to advertise abroad to fill consultant posts. Currently they are banned from recruiting from overseas until they have tried to fill vacancies from within this country. Mr Hunt unveiled plans to help hospitals cope with the increase in those turning up at A&E and an expected surge in sick patients this winter. Fifty-three NHS trusts whose A&E units are understaffed or lack beds will be given a total of £250million, while around £62million will go towards extra staffing including paying consultants to work evenings and weekends. Care of elderly and other vulnerable patients at home will be improved to prevent them needing to go to A&E, and ambulances could be turned into mobile casualty units with patients diagnosed, treated and even dropped off back at home.

Muslim students have been banned from wearing religious veils into a college because of fears regarding security. Teenagers at Birmingham Metropolitan College have been told to remove any items of clothing covering their faces so they are 'easily identifiable at all times'. But while some students welcomed the move, arguing it keeps them safer, others called it 'disgusting'. Two Muslim students at the Birmingham Metropolitan College campus in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands. The college have banned Muslim girls from wearing a veil. Eyes, nose and mouth all have to be visible . Controversial policy: Staff at Birmingham Metropolitan College, pictured, have said the guidelines are in place for 'security reasons' The ban of the niqab, a veil . which leaves a thin slot for the eyes, has caused some female students enroll at different college. News . of the policy, which also requires students to remove hats and hoodies, . was broken to those who were starting at the college last week. Student Imaani Ali, 17, said her 'freedom had been breached' by the rule. Outrage: Imaani Ali, 17, believes the ban on veils is a breach of her freedom - this veil is not allowed because it covers all, but Imaani's eyes . 'Me . and another friend who wears the veil were only told we wouldn’t be . allowed inside the college after we had enrolled,' she said. 'They . haven’t provided us with another alternative. We said we would happily . show the men at security our faces so they could check them against our . IDs, but they won’t let us. 'It’s a breach of my freedom and I feel discriminated against. 'This is my religion, it is what I believe in. 'I don’t really want to go to a place that doesn’t accept me but I have no choice now.' Another 17-year-old girl, who did not want to be named, was so upset at the policy that has she decided to look for another college place in the city. She said: 'It’s disgusting. 'It is a personal choice and I find it absolutely shocking that this has been brought in at a college in Birmingham city centre when the city is so multicultural and so many of the students are Muslim. 'It upsets me that we are being discriminated against. 'I don’t think my niqab prevents me from studying or communicating with anyone. 'I’ve never had any problems in the city before.' Suleman Hussain, 17, is taking A-level science at the college and strongly disagreed with the guidelines. Safety: Philip Hollobone, MP for Kettering, left, refuses to see constituents who do not lift their veil while Anna Dorj, 18, a business student, right, said the veil ban was 'good for security' He said: 'They’re not going to bring a bomb to college. They have come here to learn.' The strict policy was announced days after the issue of wearing religious dress was brought up in parliament. Kettering . MP Philip Hollobone, who refuses to see constituents who will not lift . their veils,  raised the issue in a Private Member’s Bill, saying it . 'goes against the basic part of the British way of life'. Principal and chief executive of the college. Dame Christine Braddock, defended the policy, saying it had been in place for some time and had been developed to keep students safe. She . said: 'We have a very robust Equality, Diversity & Inclusion Policy . at Birmingham Metropolitan College but we are committed to ensuring . that students are provided with a safe and welcoming learning . environment whilst studying with us. 'To ensure that safeguarding is a priority, we have developed our policy alongside student views to ensure we keep them safe. 'This . needs individuals to be easily identifiable at all times when they are . on college premises and this includes the removal of hoodies, hats, caps . and veils so that faces are visible. 'All prospective and progressing students, as well as staff, have been advised of the policy, which will mean everyone allowed on the premises can understand and know each other in a safe environment.' President of the Muslim Association of Britain, Omer El-Hamdoon, said the women at the college should accept the policy and abide by the rules . 'Some feel it is part of their religion but they need to be practical,' he said. 'If you go to a bank riding a motorbike, you are required to take your helmet off and identify yourself. 'And when it comes to sitting exams there is also an issue surrounding identification, because the college needs to know who is sitting the paper. 'Some feel it goes against their freedom of expression, but they should abide by the rules that are part of society.' A Muslim woman near the entrance of Birmingham Metropolitan College, where face-covering veils have been banned - a veil covering all but eyes is deemed unacceptable . Other students at the college, which has several campuses across the West Midlands, said the ban makes them feel safer. Chante Young, 17, who is studying business, said: 'You don’t know who is underneath it. 'You can’t see any of their face - only their eyes.' lieve it is good for security. You can’t see their . face and it is hard to communicate with them.' Ozayr . Mir, 17, also studies business. He said: 'The rule is alright if it is . for security reasons. They aren’t being asked to show off their body . parts.' Two weeks ago, a judge told a Muslim woman she had to remove her burkha in court before she could enter a plea. The 21-year-old woman refused to reveal her face because there were men in the room and it was against her religious beliefs. Judge Peter Murphy said the principle of open justice overrode her beliefs, and warned there was a risk a different person could go into the dock pretending to be her. Case by case: Schools can outlaw veils but only after a consultation . Headteachers have the power to order students to remove veils after a series of high profile legal cases. In a key 2007 case, a High Court judge rejected a bid by a pupil to be allowed to wear the niqab in class. Although the 12-year-old’s three older sisters had worn the headwear at the same school in Buckinghamshire, teachers said it impeded their ability to communicate with her. They said they needed to be able to tell if a pupil was paying attention, engaged with her work or distressed. After the case, the Government issued guidance that enabled headteachers to ban full-face veils on grounds of security, safety or learning. It said teachers were justified in enforcing uniform rules which mean they can see and make eye contact with pupils. Schools need to be able to identify pupils to maintain order in classrooms and to spot any intruders, it added. But rather than a French-style blanket ban on face coverings in all public spaces, the Department of Education said institutions could outlaw the coverings as long as they carried out a proper consultation. Updated Government guidance released last year clearly continues to back heads who choose to ban face-coverings. It says it is ‘still lawful’ to restrict the freedom of pupils to express their religion on the grounds of ‘health, safety and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others’. And religious freedoms do not mean pupils can practise their beliefs ‘at any time, in any place, or in any particular manner,’ the  guidance adds.","Birmingham Metropolitan College forces teenagers to remove items .

Juvinai Ferreira, 22, pleaded guilty to wounding Mark Bridger in Wakefield Prison when he appeared at Leeds Crown Court via video-link. Ferreira attacked the 47-year-old just months after Bridger was jailed for life for abducting and murdering April, in Machynlleth, Wales last year. Juvinai Ferreira (right) has admitted attacking Mark Bridger (left) just months after he was jailed for abducting and murdering April Jones in Wales last year . No details of the attack were given in court today and Ferreira will be sentenced on October 2. According to reports at the time of the attack, which happened on July 7, Bridger needed hospital treatment to a face wound after he was slashed with a makeshift knife. He was returned to Wakefield after his injury was stitched. On screen in court today, Ferreira, who is a convicted murderer and originally from Gambia, looked bored and propped his head up with his hand for most of the proceedings as he sat at a desk in prison clothes. At one point in the 20-minute hearing he asked one of his guards: 'I thought this was going to be quick?' After Judge Christopher Batty told him the case was going to be adjourned, Ferreira said to him: 'Can you just not sentence me? I can't keep coming back. Just give me anything and move on.' Bridger (left, leaving Mold Crown Court) was given a whole-life tariff by a judge in May for the abduction and murder of April Jones (right) Judge Batty told him he needed a . pre-sentence report to assess his level of dangerousness and decide . whether a second life term was appropriate. Ferreira was found guilty at Norwich Crown Court in 2009 of murdering Elaine Walpole in Dereham, Norfolk, in April 2008. At the time police said Ferreira moved to Dereham in 2007 with a relative after escaping civil war in Africa. He befriended 47-year-old Miss Walpole, an alcoholic who lived alone, after they met at a shop and she bought him cigarettes. Ferreira attacked the 47-year-old in Wakefield Prison (pictured) just months after Bridger was sentenced to life in jail . Prosecutors at the time suggested that Ferreira was 'sex-crazed'. Post-mortem tests showed that Miss Walpole, a former hotel worker who had three children, had been stabbed three times and bitten. Detectives and forensic experts spent nearly a year carrying out checks to show Ferreira was an adult as he said he was 16. Once it was proved he was an adult, Ferreira was given a life sentence and told he must serve at least 22 years before being considered for parole. Father-of-six Bridger snatched April near her home in Machynlleth. He was given a whole-life tariff by a judge in May at Mold Crown Court.

Ed Miliband was met with stony silence by union leaders yesterday, even after dropping plans to dilute their infamous block vote within the Labour Party. Most of his attempt to repair his battered relationship with union barons was met with silence or unenthusiastic applause. And the biggest cheer of the day came from the head of the Public and Commercial Services union, who demanded to know whether he backed the coalition's austerity programme. Scroll down to watch... Pressure: Labour leader Ed Miliband told the Trades Union Congress in Bournemouth that unions had an important part to play in his party . Grilling: Mr Miliband took questions, with TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady looking on . The Labour leader, who owes his job to union voting power, used his speech to argue they are not ‘the enemy within’ and lauded their 6.5million members as ‘the people who make Britain what it is’. But he acknowledged that his party reforms could mean as few as one in ten union members who currently contribute to Labour coffers will do so in future. The changes will ensure members have to specifically opt in for their fees to go to the party. Union leaders lambasted the plans at the weekend, saying Mr Miliband was a ‘schoolboy’ who lives in ‘cloud cuckoo land’. Addressing . the TUC conference in Bournemouth today, Mr Miliband launched a . trenchant defence of trade unionism, rejecting Margaret Thatcher’s . famous description of parts of the movement as enemies. Silence: Large parts of Mr Miliband;s speech were greeted with silence or unenthusiastic applause . But taking questions he faced hostility from public sector workers unhappy at spending cuts designed to cut the nation's debts. Janice Godrich, president of the Public and Commercial Services union which has staged several strikes opposing austerity, used a question and answer session to tackle the Labour leader. She told Mr Miliband: 'Ed Balls says this is the wrong sort of recovery, yet you're committed to the Tories' spending plans. You say the next election will be about living standards; but you're committed to the public sector pay cap. 'Your policies seem contradictory and they're confusing people. Can we get a clear answer: are you for or against austerity?' After appearing taken aback, the Labour leader said: 'We are not in favour of austerity.' But he then risked angering the unions by admitting that Labour would stick to Tory spending limits in order to appear 'credible'. Speaking afterwards Ms Godrich said: 'Austerity isn't working, our members know that and people up and down the country know it. 'It is incredibly disappointing that, in front of an audience of delegates representing more than six million workers, Ed Miliband failed to offer the alternative people so desperately want and need.' In his speech Mr Miliband accused David Cameron of devaluing millions of ordinary workers through his attacks on the unions. ‘We . have a Prime Minister who writes you and your members off,’ he said. ‘Who doesn’t just write you off, but oozes contempt for you from every . pore. What does he say about you? He says your members are a threat to . our economy. Back to the enemy within. ‘Six and a half million people in . Britain. Who teach our children, who look after the sick, who care for . the elderly, who build our homes, who keep our shops open morning, noon . and night. They’re not the enemy within. They’re the people who make . Britain what it is. Finishing touches: Mr Miliband drafted his speech on the train to Bournemouth . ‘How dare he? How dare he insult people, members of trade unions, as he does? How dare he write off whole sections of our society? ‘One Nation Conservatives, would be . turning in their graves if they could hear the nasty, divisive, . small-minded rhetoric of the leader of their once great party. 'We know from recent experience what happens to political leaders who write off whole sections of a country. ‘That’s . what Mitt Romney did when he talked about the 47 per cent of people who . would never vote for him. And look what happened to him.’ Under . the current system, union members automatically pay an annual fee of £3 . to the Labour party unless they specifically opt out – swelling party . funds by millions of pounds a year. Mr Miliband has unveiled plans to force trade unionists to actively opt in to the funding of Labour, with the reward that they will become full party members. He told delegates he believes his changes could see his party’s membership increase by 300,000 – a figure critics say will make him a hostage to fortune if it does not come about. But the target number is far fewer than the three million union members who  currently contribute to Labour coffers because they have not opted out. Labour is likely to head off the threat of a huge loss of funds by charging those who opt in more than the current £3 a year. Critics say the reforms could  actually strengthen the unions, because it could see them hanging on to more money designed for political campaigning. Mr Miliband said: ‘It will be a . massive challenge for the Labour Party to reach out to your members in a . way that we have not done for many years and persuade them to be part . of what we do. ‘And, like anything that is hard, it is a risk. But the bigger risk is just saying let’s do it as we have always done it.’ Chuka . Umunna, who is Labour’s business spokesman, said it was important to . ‘take the big money out of politics’ even if it hit the party’s . finances. But backbencher Ian Lavery said Labour faced ruin and meltdown as a result of the ‘ill thought through’ reforms. Yesterday . Len McCluskey, general secretary of the powerful Unite union, called on . Mr Miliband to be even stronger in his defence of union links. ‘Trade unions . have always been a force for good in our society,’ he told a fringe . event at the conference. Instead of attacking, people should look to try . and unite the nation.’ n Mugs celebrating the death in April of Lady Thatcher are on sale at the TUC conference. Bearing . the legend ‘I Still Hate Thatcher’, they are available alongside . T-shirts and mugs with the slogan ‘Tories are Lower than Vermin’. Conservative politicians said the merchandise highlighted the nasty side of the Left. Conor Burns, MP for Bournemouth West, said: ‘She said they couldn’t forgive her because she won and they lost. She was right.’ Unions and Left-wing campaign groups are planning a national day of strikes and civil disobedience on Bonfire Night as part of their campaign against the Government’s austerity programme. Yesterday TUC delegates approved the call for unions to co-ordinate a programme of strikes. The union-backed People’s Assembly had already organised a protest, which was planned to take place on November 5. However this is now set to be directly supported by the unions themselves. Key workers – from nurses to firemen, teachers to postmen – could cause chaos if they decide to join the walkout. The plan raises the possibility of firemen and nurses striking on Guy Fawkes night, a move which could force people to cancel parties due to health and safety fears. Unions are legally allowed to ‘co-ordinate’ their strike action, or organise walkouts on the same day, as long as they have each successfully balloted their workforce on separate trade disputes. This is not the same as organising ‘sympathy strikes’ where workers walk out in support of other striking workers without having held a legal ballot. These were outlawed during the 1980s. Yesterday Unite’s executive director of policy Steve Turner said he believes the ‘yes’ vote has committed the union to a policy of ‘fighting back, industrially where possible’. He added: ‘But more than that, it commits us to organise a mass mobilisation.’","Ed Miliband delivers speech praising unions at TUC conference .

Susan Meakin, 42, and her colleagues scooped £4,550.60 when they matched four numbers and two lucky stars last December. But Meakin, who was in charge of the syndicate, failed to tell the other 71 members of the syndicate about the win and used the cash to pay off some of her £30,000 gambling debts. Meakin, 42, had the cheque for the winnings made out in her name and cashed the £4,550.60 into her own account without telling her friends . She walked free from court yesterday after admitting the theft as well as stealing £300 from a customer which was accidentally left at a self-service till where she worked. The mother of one was handed a 12 week prison sentence suspended for 12 months when she appeared at Nottingham Magistrates Court. She was also ordered to repay the whole amount to the syndicate. The court heard Meakin was deputy manager of Sainsbury's in Beeston, Nottinghamshire, when she volunteered to be in charge of the EuroMillions lottery syndicate. Meakin kept the win secret from her colleagues at Sainsbury's Beeston store near Nottingham (pictured) After they scooped a share of the cash on December 21 last year she had the cheque made out to herself. Prosecutor Syma Akhtar told the court . Meakin, of Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, took £500 cash from the winnings . before depositing the rest three days after the win. She said: 'She was only caught when she let slip the news of the win to another member of staff.' She was sacked from her role in February this year after the thefts. Meakin, who was in charge of the syndicate, failed to tell the other 71 members of the syndicate about the win and used the cash to pay off some of her £30,000 gambling debts . JPs said she was in a 'position of trust' which she had breached. Magistrate Julie Handford told her: 'The position you held was one where you were trusted by your employers, by the public and by staff at the store, most of whom were junior to you.' Maria Bines, defending, said Meakin had been struggling with a gambling addiction and had racked up debts of £30,000 through online gambling sites as well as high street arcades. She said: 'It (the lottery syndicate) was mentioned around the lunch table and there were 72 people who were interested in taking part. 'She started gambling following the death of her father as a way of escaping. 'She started to take out loans and credit cards to pay her debts, and then took out payday loans just to pay off the debts that were accruing. 'She was of good character and worked hard all her life.' Meakin, who is unemployed, refused to comment outside court.","Susan Meakin and 71 of her Sainsbury's colleagues scooped £4,550 when they matched four numbers and two lucky stars last December .

Kishore Nimmala, 32, says he has put off dating for life after arguing with his date over who should pay for the next round of drinks. Yesterday a jury at Southwark Crown Court took just 53 minutes to clear him of theft, accepting his claim that he took his date's phone in anger but never intended to keep the device.

He says he has not been on a date since February after being left emotionally scarred by his experience. He told the Evening Standard: 'I’m just very happy to be cleared. 'But it’s not just the money I have been struggling mentally for the last seven months. 'I could have lost everything had I been convicted. I feel like I never want to go on a date again.

A £2million country pile complete with extensive stables, scenic views over the south Cotswolds and a set of rather unlikely neighbours. The luxury home next door to Prince Charles' Highgrove estate has gone on the market creating a storm of interest. The properties share a boundary fence and just three fields separate the grounds of Ashworth House from its royal neighbours. Described as 'a superb Cotswold stone property of generous proportions' Ashworth House has been 'sympathetically modernised' to blend rustic charm with comfort and convenience . Located in the rural village of Westonbirt near the historic market town of Tetbury in Gloucestershire, Ashworth House is approached by a beautiful sweeping driveway. With four bedrooms and three bathrooms it is not the biggest of homes but the chance to stop in for a royal cup of tea next door more than makes up for it. Described as 'a superb Cotswold stone property of generous proportions' estate agents Chesterton Humberts emphasise who Ashworth House 'has been sympathetically modernised in recent years to create a wonderful family home.' The entrance hallway is 'spacious', the kitchen/breakfast room is 'magnificent' and the living space is topped off by a 'sunny orangery' leading to the gardens beyond. Three more reception rooms look out over the stunning gardens and there is even a large utility room to leave your muddy coats and boots after a tromp around the 12 acre grounds. Royal neighbours: Less than half a mile separates the two homes in the heart of the beautiful British countryside . Four reception rooms on the ground floor include a living room with beautiful fireplace and a sunny orangery . And all that is in addition to the chance of finding is Royal Highness peering over your garden fence. But bargain hunters should look away now as the 'spacious' home will offer little change from a cool £2million. Upstairs there are four large bedrooms, with both the master and guest bedroom enjoying their own en-suites - occupants of the other two rooms must endure the hardship of sharing a 'family' bathroom between them. And if that isn't enough Ashworth also has a 'delightful' two-bedroom cottage nestled in nearly 12 acres of grounds where guests can be generously accommodated without disturbing the main household. Spacious: The open plan kitchen and breakfast room with large central island is described as 'magnificent' by agents . Relaxed: With four reception rooms and a separate guest cottage Ashworth house offers plenty of space to unwind and entertain . Modern and traditional: While the exterior of the home remains in-keeping with the typical stone architecture of the area, the interiors have been gently renovated to feel light and modern . Here visiting relatives or monarchs can enjoy the open plan kitchen and living area with a characteristic spiral staircase leading to the bedrooms above. Estate agent Nick Crowall described the opportunity the property offers to share a fence with the Prince of Wales. He said: 'The property shares the boundary fence with Highgrove, it's a matter of three fields away. 'Although Ashworth is less than half a mile from the main house on the royal estate unfortunately you can only see the trees, it is as you would imagine exceptionally well protected. Upstairs: Four large airy bedrooms are complete with period features and beautiful views over the grounds . Well equipped: Both the master bedroom and the guest bedroom have their own ensuite facilities while the other two bedrooms share a generously proportioned family bathroom . 'It has been on the market for a couple of months now and has had quite a lot of interest, it has wonderful equestrian facilities and is right in the heart of the Beaufort Hunt. 'You're looking at the boundary with the royal residence, you could literally hop the fence and be there and of course there is the phenomenal pull of the Highrove shop as well.' Ashworth also comes with top class riding facilities, including an American barn stable complex built by Monarch equestrian which can accommodate a dozen horses. There is also a tack room, separate WC, wash box with rubberised floor, tack room and drying room and feed room. In the heart of the hunt: With stunning views of rural Gloucestershire, the trees protecting the main home at Highgrove can also be seen across the fields . Cosy: Nestled into 12 acres of grounds the property also has a separate two bedroom cottage with spiral staricase . Outdoors there is also a 40m x 20m riding school next to the stable block and remaining land is divided into four post and rail fenced paddocks. The 'well established gardens' which surround the house are laid out as lawns punctuates with with mature trees and shrub borders. Highgrove, the country home of the Prince of Wales, was bought by the Duchy of Cornwall in 1980 as was used by the Prince Charles and Princess Diana as a weekend home from autumn of 1981. Royal family home: Right, Prince Charles and Princess Diana pose with Princes William and Harry at Highgrove in the eighties, and left, the Highgrove photographed from the air . Green fingered: Prince Charles appears on BBC show Countryfile earlier this year working on his Southern English hedge at Highgrove . The house was previously the home of . Maurice Macmillan, Conservative MP for Farnham and son of the former . Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, for 14 years. It has four reception rooms, nine main bedrooms, a nursery wing and staff quarters and at the time was also where the young Prince William and Harry's ponies were kept. It was built 1796 to 1798 and is believed to have been designed by architect Anthony Keck. The Highgrove estate consists of the woodland around the main house, a number of farm buildings and around 900 acres of farm land known as the Home Farm. A keen gardener, the Prince of has devoted much time to planning and designing the gardens Highgrove. Over the last 30 year he has created a wild garden, a formal garden and a walled kitchen garden and planted a large number of trees in the grounds. The estate also backs onto the grounds of Westonbirt Arboretum. The village of Westonbirt itself is a popular and sought after area in the south Cotswolds. The American style barn can accommodate a dozen horses and also has a tack room, drying room, feed room and separate WC . State of the art: Ashworth boasts top class equestrian facilities including paddocks and purpose built riding school . The area is also superbly situated for those with sporting interests with polo at Beaufort Polo Club and Badminton and Gatcombe horse trials just a short distance away. The property is conveniently located with acccess to the M4 at Junctions 17 and 18 providing easy access to London and the M5. There are also regular train services to London Paddington from Kemble and Chippenham, both around 10 miles away. The area is particularly well served by both state and independent schools for girls and boys including numerous local private schools such as Beaudesert Park, Westonbirt, Rosehill Westonbirt, St Mary’s Calne as well as the colleges in Cheltenham and Bath.","Property comes complete with four bedrooms, three bathrooms and accommodation for a dozen horses .

In the age of textspeak, Facebook and Twitter, the combinations of words, numbers and symbols has become even more difficult to understand . For the nation’s ‘Rents’ the language of their beloved children may well leave them feeling a little ‘blond’. However, a new dictionary promises to help unravel the mystery surrounding the everyday conversations of the playground and internet. Dr Claire Hardaker, Professor of Linguistics at Lancaster University, has provided a lexicon of words used by children aged six to 14, together with definitions. For example, the professor explains that ‘rents’ is shorthand for parents while ‘blond’ is used to describe a lack of intelligence. The new generation of words in common usage on social networks and in the playground also includes ‘Noob’,  ‘Tekkers’, ‘Jelly’, ‘Dub, and ‘Ratchet’. The professor, working in partnership with Disney, has also translated some great literary works, from Romeo and Juliet to Oliver Twist and even Winnie the Pooh to help crack the code. In truth, every generation of children has developed its own slang which is deliberately designed to keep their parents and teachers from knowing what is going on. However, in the age of textspeak, Facebook and Twitter, the combinations of words, numbers and symbols has become even more opaque. Dr Hardaker said: ‘Children have always been wonderful innovators that delight in creating new words. ‘In the 60s and 70s, ‘hip’, ‘whizzo’ and ‘fab’, in the 80s and 90s, ‘gnarly’, ‘phat’ and ‘the bomb’ - and with young people increasingly communicating online, soaking up dozens of new words, slang language is evolving at lightning speed, particularly words of praise or insult. ‘Research suggests the ability to learn new language after our teens is drastically reduced, so it can be harder for parents to be attuned to the linguistic evolution that their children are actively driving forward. ‘This can result in a real mismatch between what they think their children are saying and what their language actually means.’ A collection of 50 words most commonly used online by children aged six to 14 has been collected by Disney’s Club Penguin, which is the largest gaming and social interaction site for youngsters in the world. A new dictionary promises to help unravel the mystery surrounding the everyday conversations of the playground and internet . Disney research found that almost seven in 10 mums and dads were unable to identify whether commonly used words are positive or negative in meaning. For example, in the upside down world created by children, the words ‘Naughty’ and ‘Savage’ means something is good, while ‘Butters’ means ugly and ‘Owned’ means embarrassed. The company’s new ‘digital native dictionary’ is designed to help the two thirds of UK parents who admit that they don’t have a good grasp of the language their child uses with their peers online. It is being published today(wed) to mark the launch of a pan-European campaign called ‘It Starts With You’ to teach kids and parents about online safety. Disney’s Lucy Woodward, Interactive Live Services Director at Club Penguin, said: ‘Our moderators have their fingers on the pulse of popular culture and one of their essential roles in keeping online interaction between children safe is to spot new or changed words that kids are using as a part of their online conversations. ‘As a parent, I know keeping up with my kids’ ever-evolving vocabulary can be a challenge and I hope our new dictionary will help parents speak ‘digital native’.’ The move to help educate parents about what children are doing online is being supported by a TV and internet safety campaign fronted by Una Healy from The Saturdays.","A new dictionary promises to help unravel the mystery surrounding playground and internet speak .

America is ranked the 17th happiest country in the world trailing the Scandinavian countries which came out on top . The UK remained fairly constant at around 6.88 both years -  ranking 22nd in the happiness league table this year. Danish people are the happiest in the world and are closely followed by their Scandinavian neighbours in the latest research from the United Nations which evaluated 156 countries. Switzerland and the Netherlands also feature high in the UN's ranking system, which has assessed freedom, corruption, generosity, social support, life expectancy, GDP per capita and other social elements in each country. Last year the UN highlighted America as an example of a country that illustrates the 'great contradictions' that exist in humanity today. It said: 'The U.S. has achieved striking economic and technical progress over the past half century, but with gains in self reported happiness of the citizenry,' the report states. It went on to say the U.S. was an example of how wealth alone did not equate to happiness, pointing out the country's GNP per capita had risen by a factor of three since 1960, while measures of average happiness have remained essentially unchanged over the half-century. Individual levels of happiness were assessed as were measurements of a country's levels of corruption, social freedoms, social support and life expectancy . There are no such statements in this year's report, perhaps in part because a greater number of variables were considered. However, overall, the report notes that at the individual level, happiness is directly linked to good mental and physical health, someone to count on, job security and stable families. And greater over-arching influences are also key factors in people's happiness rating, the report argues, including political freedom, strong social networks and an absence of corruption. Drawing on these conclusions, Professor Jeffery Sachs, said: 'There is now a rising worldwide demand that policy be more closely aligned with what really matters to people as they themselves characterize their well-being,' said Professor Jeffery Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, New York, which produced the report. 'More and more world leaders are talking about the importance of well-being as a guide for their nations and the world,' he is quoted in USA Today. He added that the report offers evidence that the systematic measurement and analysis of happiness can teach us a lot about ways to improve the world, in term's of people's well-being and countries' sustainable development. 20.

Denmark (7.693) Denmark, Norway and Switzerland each scored 7.6 out of a possible 10 in the happiness ranking measurement. The next top three were Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden. The least happy countries are all poor countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (Togo, Benin, Central African Republic, Sierra Leone) with average life evaluation scores of 3.4. It is the second annual happiness report the UN has carried out - the first was unveiled in 2012 to much media attention at the multilateral agency's high-level meeting on happiness and well-being. Today's report shows positive feelings have improved in many countries, particularly in Latin America, and parts of Africa. But the measurement also fell in countries where there was political and economic upheaval, including Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain and Egypt. Greece stands out from the other countries in having the largest changes in life evaluations and affect measures, 'beyond what can be explained by average responses to the economic crisis.' the report states. The country's out-of-10 happiness measurement fell from 6.326 to 5.435. The report says: 'Research has shown that economic and other crises are more easily weathered and indeed provide the scope for cooperative actions that improve subjective well-being, if trust levels and other aspects of the social and institutional fabric are sufficiently high and well-maintained when the crisis hits.'","U.S. ranked 17th out of 156 countries but falls overall in recent years .

Diana Nyad, the American woman who became the first person to swim the 103 miles from Cuba to Florida on Monday, has described how she pushed through excruciating pain to achieve her life-long dream. The 64-year-old said sheer determination and the experience of her age helped her overcome jellyfish, sea sickness and extreme fatigue to finish the grueling swim in 52 hours, 54 minutes and 18.6 seconds. It was her fifth attempt at the swim, which she completed without a shark cage. 'When I finally got to the destination, I was euphoric,' said Nyad, whose mouth was swollen from a mask she wore to protect her face from deadly jellyfish, as she appeared on GMA on Tuesday. But the record-breaking feat came after hours of struggle. 'With all the experience I have, I didn't realize how much suffering there was going to be,' she said. Scroll down for video . Record holder: Diana Nyad appeared on GMA (left) and Today (right) on Tuesday after swimming from Cuba to Florida. Her mouth was left swollen from a mask she wore to protect herself from jellyfish . 'The wind was huge, the jellyfish mask made me take in a lot of water, I was sick as a dog. I was vomiting constantly almost throughout the 53 hours. You don't have strength anymore. So I wasn't just out there daydreaming, I was dealing with a crisis,' she told Kate Bolduan on CNN's New Day. Usually during an hours-long swim 'you're singing Neil Young songs to yourself, counting French and German and Spanish to yourself,' she told New Day. 'But when you're suffering - with the mask, with the salt water - now you're not thinking of anything, you're just coping and surviving.' She also battled through the loneliness of the 53-hour swim. 'It's a very isolating experience even though I have 35 people around me,' she said. But despite the pain, she followed her mantra - 'Never give up' - to reach the shore.

Not . only was she better prepared with advice from the world's top jellyfish . expert, but the Gulf Stream was also moving north towards her . destination. 'This time I got lucky,' she told CNN. 'The gulf stream was my friend and usually it's not.' She also said that her age - 64 - was largely responsible for her achieving the feat she first attempted in her 20s. 'I really do believe that endurance grows and we can never discount the mental,' she told GMA. 'The power of concentration and the perspective of what it all means and what you're capable of are infinitely higher at this age than when you're a young 20-something.'

Aaron Hernandez did not see his former Patriots teammates stage a thrilling comeback against the Buffalo Bills on the NFL opening weekend - because he is not allowed to watch any football while he is behind bars. The 23-year-old former tight end is being held at Bristol County Jail and as part of that facilities policy for inmates no games are aired, wiping out football entirely from his life while he languishes in custody. 'While Mr. Hernandez and many other inmates would like to watch football, it is just not part of our policy here… so that will not be happening,' Sheriff Hodgson told TMZ. Last week, the former NFL star pleaded not guilty to murdering a semi-professional footballer who was found shot dead near his Massachusetts home in June. Scroll down for video .

The . former New England Patriots tight end was indicted last month, when he . was hit with a laundry list of criminal charges, including first-degree . murder, carrying a firearm and possession of a firearm. He . pleaded not guilty to the six charges as his fiancee Shayanna Jenkins . and supporters wearing 'Free AH 81' looked on. He will continue to be . held without bail until his next hearing in October. The emotional response from Lloyd's family came as his girlfriend, Shaneah Jenkins, told NECN that she's tired of the focus on Hernandez. Jenkins' sister is engaged to Hernandez. 'Every time there’s a story out it's always about the alleged murder and it's not about the tragedy that happened to Odin,' she said. 'The loss that all of us have taken and the fact that he is a human and his life was taken.' Prosecutors claim that Hernandez . orchestrated Lloyd's killing because he was upset at him for talking to . people Hernandez had problems with at a nightclub days earlier. It has also been suggested that he killed Lloyd because he knew about Hernandez's involvement in a 2012 double homicide. Hernandez has never been charged in that case.

Victim: Footballer Odin Lloyd, 27, was found shot dead near to Hernandez's home on June 17 . Defense attorney Charles Rankin said Hernandez's lawyers are confident that Hernandez will be exonerated during a trial. 'Not one shred of evidence has been presented yet,' he said. Shortly . before Lloyd's death, authorities say, Lloyd sent his sister text . messages. He asked if she had seen who he was with when he got into the . car in Boston. Then he indicated who it was in a way that Lloyd's family said he knew his sister would understand. 'NFL,' he wrote. 'Just so you know.' Moments later, authorities say, Lloyd was dead after gunshots rang out in an unpaved construction area by a warehouse after he apparently got out of the car for what he thought was a bathroom break. Authorities have not said who fired the shots, but according to court documents, Ortiz told police in Florida that Wallace said it was Hernandez. Wallace has pleaded not guilty to a charge of accessory to murder after the fact. Ortiz has pleaded not guilty to a firearm charge. Both are being held in jail without bail. Authorities have said they haven't found the murder weapon, which they believe was a .45-caliber Glock pistol, but warrants released earlier this month suggested Hernandez may have asked his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, to dispose of it.

Two members of a family of fraudsters who conned elderly investors in a £4.5 million fine wine scam have been jailed for a total of ten-and-a-half years. Daniel Snelling, 38, tricked scores of investors into putting thousands of pounds into Australian wine - dubbed the ‘best money could buy’. Along with his sister, Dina Snelling, 35, and their cousin Rebecca McDonald, 43, he vowed to sell the fine-wine at massive profits after three years in ‘premium storage’. Daniel Snelling along with his sister Dina vowed to sell the fine-wine at massive profits after three years in ‘premium storage’. The firm raked in £2.5million by offering thousands of bottles but then closed the business . The firm, Nouveau World Wines, raked in £2.5 million by offering thousands of bottles - but pulled the plug on the business before investors could retrieve their cash. Snelling then reinvested the money in a second con, Finbow Wines, selling cheap Italian wine at events such as the 2010 World Cup. They raked in an average of £5,000 from investors - many of them elderly - and even persuaded some to buy 10,000 bottles a time. In fact only a fraction of the wine was ever produced. Rebecca McDonald was jailed for three years at Southwark Crown Court today . Snelling was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years, and McDonald was jailed for three years at Southwark Crown Court today. Wearing grey, McDonald broke down in tears as she was led out of the dock by uniformed guards, and there were cries from the public gallery as her family sobbed ‘she is innocent’ and shouted 'it’s a disgrace'. Dina Snelling was not in court today as she was admitted to hospital last week after her depression deteriorated. She will be sentenced on October 11. Sentencing Snelling, Judge Michael Grieve QC said: 'In my assessment you are not so much a cold and calculated criminal, but one whose conscience is eased by self delusion and denial.' He added: 'The combined monetary loss amounted to just over £4.5m. 'Your victims were individuals in many instances elderly and retired people looking for a return on their modest savings. 'They were not for the most part seasoned investors and the conspiracy relied on their vulnerability. 'One hard sell came close to emotional blackmail and a recording played to the court was heart-rending. 'In my view a significant proportion of the investors can be described as vulnerable. 'There were a large number of victims that run into the hundreds. 'You Daniel Snelling instigated, designed and were the driving force behind both conspiracies. 'You brought in members of your family to help with the running of both frauds. Your sister Dina and cousin Rebecca, their current predicaments are in a large part due to you.' Snelling was also banned from being a company director for ten years and subject to a Serious Crime Prevention Order which restricts his business activities. Deceit: Photograph shows a Nouveau wine brochure which was used to persuade victims to hand over cash . Turning to McDonald, Judge Grieve added: 'The seriousness of the offence for which I have to sentence you makes an immediate custodial sentence utterly inescapable.' Daniel Snelling enjoyed an ‘extravagant’ lifestyle with the cash he raked in - spending his ill-gotten gains on flashy cars and trips to Australia, while Dina spent the money on cosmetic surgery, the court was told. Jane Osbourne, prosecuting, said: 'The victims can properly be described as vulnerable. They were individuals who were investing in some cases the entirety of their life savings.' Daniel Snelling launched the fraud in January 2007 as the sole shareholder and company director of Nouveau World Wines. With Dina as office director and McDonald, a former employee of accountancy giant KPMG, working as business development manager, they cold-called victims promising top-end wines as a better investment than stocks and shares. Daniel Snelling launched the fraud in January 2007 as the sole shareholder and company director of Nouveau World Wines . The trio pretended to have “prestige” offices in Berkeley Square, Mayfair, which was actually just a postal address for their real base in Greenwich, south-east London. Between January 2007 and August 2009, Snelling’s firm promised to make 39,000 bottles of fine wine - but in fact produced just a quarter of that sum. Facing the heat of investors who had put in £2.5million, Dempsey pulled the plug on Nouveau World Wines and ploughed much of the profit into a new venture, Finbow Wines. But again, investors never saw a return on the money put into the scam, and just two containers were actually purchased and shipped to China. Just as Snelling and his fraudster family were about to duck out again and move on to a third wine scam venture, selling Old World wines, cops swooped on March 4, 2010. In mitigation, the court heard how the victims 'should not be treated as vulnerable', as they were willing to 'take calculated risks'. Dorian Lovell-Plank, defending Daniel Snelling, said: 'This was not a case of switching on a light and becoming fraudulent overnight. Nouveau was a company that started well and ended badly.' The sentencing resumed from yesterday after the hearing was 'regrettably' cut short by Judge Grieve because Serco prison officers were showing gang members around the cells to put them off breaking the law. The family of the defendants, which packed out the seats around the dock, blasted 'you’re joking' when the Judge adjourned at 4pm - even though the case was almost over. Lies: Photograph shows the investor kit sent to the victims of the fraud . Jailed: Daniel Snelling was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years imprisonment . Behind bars: McDonald broke down in tears as she was led out of the dock by uniformed guards . Daniel Snelling, of Sutton, south London, was convicted of two counts of conspiracy to defraud and two further counts of converting criminal property.

A grammar school has become only the second in Britain to be put into special measures by education inspectors despite achieving good GCSE results. Chatham Grammar School for Boys in Kent was declared inadequate after a visit by Ofsted in June. Inspectors criticised ‘weak and inadequate’ teaching and said pupils were not making the progress they were capable of despite above average results. 'Inadequate': Chatham Grammar School for boys has been placed in special measures following an Ofsted inspection . Students were well behaved as they moved around the school but this was ‘not always carried through to lessons’ where their attitudes to learning were directly linked to the quality of teaching. Behaviour in lessons had ‘declined’, with students losing ‘interest and motivation’ when teaching was not good enough. Students in all year groups, including the sixth form, reported low-level disruption in lessons that was hindering learning. Another area of concern was ‘inconsistent and irregular’ marking, with teachers assessing work ‘infrequently’. Some ‘focused on correcting presentation rather than specific advice on how to improve students’ knowledge and understanding of the subject’. The report said: ‘The quality of . learning and the quality of feedback students receive depends too much . on the individual qualities of the teacher. ‘Some . students perceive that they are ""lucky"" if the teaching they receive is . good or outstanding and they would like their work to be marked by some . teachers more frequently.’ Recovery: Stretford Grammar School in Greater Manchester became the first grammar to be placed in special measures in 2009 but it emerged a year later . The school’s executive principal Denise Shepherd said yesterday: ‘We have to accept the findings of the Ofsted report. Our job is not to criticise and unpick.’ Head teacher David Marshall retired suddenly at the end of August after fighting the findings, according to Kent Online. Commenting on whether he was forced out, Mrs Shepherd said: 'I think Mr Marshall has clearly made a decision himself and I really wasn't privy to those discussions at the time or since.' Chatham Grammar pupils achieved a 95 per cent A* to C pass rate in their GCSEs last summer - down from 100 per cent the year before.

Debut: It is the first time the glasses have been seen, even though Mr Cameron bought them in June . Mr Cameron wore the glasses to read his government briefings during a hearing of the liaison committee in Parliament. He quickly took them on and off, leading some to speculate whether he was trying to avoid being caught on camera wearing them. The Prime Minister later wrote on Twitter: 'Thanks to everyone who asked about my new glasses. I've actually had them since June - but today was the first public appearance.' Mr Cameron's glasses are the latest sign the 46-year-old may be feeling his age, after abandoning jogging because of bad knees and growing his hair longer to cover up thinning patches. Last month he complained of suffering a 'phenomenally bad back'. It is understood he has had the glasses since June, and was helped by wife Samantha to choose them.

The rimless style is very similar to those chosen by former Prime Minister Mr Blair, who joked in 2001 that he was ‘coming out’ wore his pair for the first time in public. The Labour leader said at the time: ‘Some things in life you have just got to accept. It gives a whole new meaning to the phrase vision for Britain.’ Mr Cameron was facing questions about Syria and civil service reform.

A mother found dead in a river a month after going missing from her home on Easter Sunday died from the shock of the icy water, an inquest ruled today. Leda Bolden, 39, left her home in Bedford after an argument without telling her husband, Mark Daley, 44, or 16-year-old daughter, Kasia, where she was going. The assistant headteacher's family lead a desperate month-long search effort to find her. But her body was not found until fire officers on routine training discovered it in a river. Ms Bolden had met friends for lunch and drunk about half a bottle of wine on the day she left home, Ampthill Coroner's Court heard. But despite the coroner recording that the mother may have been drunk he found no other evidence as to why she took her own life. Recording a narrative verdict, assistant coroner for Bedfordshire Bob Amos said: 'The cause of death is immersion and the circumstances in which she came to be in the river are unknown.' He said that there was no evidence that she intended to take her own life or that anyone else was involved in her death. 'However I can conclude that she was likely to have been in an agitated state of mind that evening and that she was under the influence of alcohol when she was last seen,' he said. 'My condolences to you it seems as if education has lost a good person and you have lost a good wife and mother. I am very sorry.'

A fugitive Polish gangster who fled to Britain laughed as he was jailed for 30 years for killing a man with a blow torch. Feared enforcer Mariusz Florowski, 38, was wanted for a string of gang offences in Poland when he managed to slip into Britain last year and launch a sadistic attack on a new father. The mobster, who is a member of the Warsaw mafia, tortured Benedykt Nowak, 34, roasting his face with a blow torch before dousing him in petrol after the garage owner refused to hand over his business. The victim’s brother Pzemyslan, 26, was forced to watch in terror as Florowski set Mr Nowak alight, sending flames roaring up to the ceiling of an industrial estate in Southall, west London. Horrific images were captured on CCTV of the victim staggering from the garage as the flames burnt every scrap of clothing from his body. The fireball also caused tanks and cylinders to explode as the blaze threatened to engulf neighbouring homes and businesses. Residents were evacuated after the fire also spread to a church, although no one else was hurt. Mr Nowak, who had only become a father a month earlier, was rushed to hospital but he died of his injuries two days later. The . Old Bailey heard how the criminal was wanted in Poland for a . catalogue of gang related offences yet he was able to sneak into Britain . undetected in the middle of 2012 because the authorities had failed to . issue a European Arrest Warrant. Although . he had an appalling record of violence with convictions for armed . robbery, firearms, extortion, burglary, possession of a firearm and . organised criminal gang activity in his native country, . Polish police had failed to obtain an EU Arrest Warrant which meant that British police were unaware of his history. Brutal: Mariusz Florowski (left) and Jakub Ostrowski (right) were each jailed for life with a minimum of 30 years . Instead the feared gangster was left free to boast about the kidnappings he had carried out for the Warsaw mafia. After . waltzing into Britain he teamed up with mini cab firm boss Jakub . Ostrowski, 37, who also had a string of convictions in Poland for . attacking police officers. Ostrowski . was running a cab firm called Polish Airbus, ferrying Polish immigrants . to and from airports after he came to Britain in 2004. The . pair wanted to use Mr Nowak’s garage to service Ostrowski’s vehicles . and pestered the Nowak brothers for months before they decided to force . them to hand over garage space. On . February 22 this year they turned up at their premises at Dilloway . Industrial Estate in Southall and drank four bottles of vodka with the . two brothers, who were also Polish. Then they launched a brutal onslaught, kicking Pzemyslan all over his body. He ran and hid under a car, but was dragged back in to witness what was about to happen. When . Benedykt begged them not to kill his brother, Florowski turned a blow . torch on his face, causing horrific injuries to his head and neck. Both brothers were then doused in petrol while Florowski walked between them, flicking the blow torch ignition. He snarled at Pzemyslan, ‘I’m going to finish you as well’, before setting his brother alight and fleeing in a Mercedes. Florowski grinned as he and Ostrowski were jailed for life and ordered . to serve at least 30 years each for murder and attempted murder. Judge Rebecca Poulet told the smirking gangster: ‘This attack involved sadistic conduct and almost unimaginable cruelty. ‘In my view your failure to get your way with the Nowak brothers is part of the reason for your wicked and cruel behaviour. ‘Your . attack on Ben in my view extended to tortured.’ His devastated brother . Pzemyslan told the court: ‘I feel guilty that my brother died and I . survived. ‘I feel a great . emptiness in my life. My best friend and my brother is gone.’ The Polish . authorities are now seeking to put Florowski on trial in Poland for . gang offences after he has served his sentence. Detective . Sergeant Stuart Reeves, of the Metropolitan Police, said: ‘Mariusz . Florowski and Jakub Ostrowski subjected the two brothers to a prolonged . violent attack before drenching them both in petrol. ‘The . subsequent fire also caused a vast amount of damage putting the lives . of residents and emergency service personnel at risk.’","Mariusz Florowski was wanted for a string of offences in Poland but managed to slip into Britain last year .

Public Advocate Bill de Blasio completed his surge from seemingly nowhere in New York City's mayoral primary Tuesday by taking a commanding lead on his Democratic opponents Tuesday, hovering near the threshold needed to avoid a runoff. Former Metropolitan Transit Authority Chairman Joe Lhota easily won the GOP nomination, capping a chaotic primary to succeed 12 years of Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The night also marked the unceremonious end to the bid by a City Council leader trying to become the first female and openly gay mayor, and to the political comebacks of scandal-scarred candidates Anthony Weiner and Eliot Spitzer. 'We are better as a city when we make sure that everyone has a shot,' de Blasio told his Brooklyn victory party, emphasizing his campaign theme of combating income inequality. 'We begin tonight.' With 94 percent of precincts reporting, de Blasio has about 40.02 percent of the total vote. He needs to stay above 40 percent in order to avoid triggering an automatic Oct. 1 runoff. If he cannot, he will face former city Comptroller Bill Thompson, who has 26 percent.

Elections officials are expected to . count an additional 30,000 or more votes in coming days as absentee . ballots arrive by mail and paperwork comes in from voters who had . problems at the polls. A final result may not be known for 10 days. With . de Blasio so close to 40 percent, Democratic leaders may pressure . Thompson to drop out in the name of party unity. But Thompson made it . clear Tuesday that he wanted to contest the runoff. 'Three . more weeks! Three more weeks!' chanted Thompson, the party's 2009 . nominee, referring to the campaign sprint before the potential runoff. 'This is far from over.' De Blasio's rise in the race to succeed Mayor Michael Bloomberg was as sudden as it was unexpected. Not . even two months ago, he was an afterthought in the campaign but surged . in part thanks to an ad blitz that centered on his interracial family, . his headline-grabbing arrest while protesting the possible closure of a . Brooklyn hospital and the defection of Weiner's former supporters in the . wake of another sexting scandal. Democratic mayoral hopeful Anthony Weiner leaves after making his concession speech at Connolly's Pub in Midtown Tuesday, September 10 .

Weiner makes his concession speech, saying 'We had the best ideas.

He also led Quinn, who is openly gay, among gay . voters. The voter interviews were conducted by Edison Media Research for The Associated Press and other news organizations.

Nearly . three-quarters of Democratic primary voters say the next mayor ought to . move away from Bloomberg's policies, according to the exit polls. And . De Blasio, 52, has fashioned himself as the cleanest break from the . Bloomberg years, proposing a tax on the wealthy to fund universal . pre-kindergarten and changes to city police practices he says . discriminate against minorities. 'I'm . a lefty and I've had enough of the righties,' said Jessica Safran, a . business consultant from the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn who voted . for de Blasio. 'Even if de Blasio moves to the center if he gets . elected, he'll be closer to the positions I want than the others.' All . the candidates were hosting election night rallies in venues across the . city. Each gathering went silent for 15 minutes when President Barack . Obama addressed the nation on the situation in Syria. Quinn . was the front-runner for much of the year, boasting the biggest . campaign war chest and strong establishment backing. But she was dogged . by her support to change term limits to let Bloomberg run again in 2009, . a decision unpopular with liberals who make up the bulk of Democratic . primary voters. Turnout . appeared light, but the city's complaint line received several thousand . voting-related calls. Many reported jams and breakdowns in the . antiquated lever machines, which were hauled out of retirement to . replace much-maligned electronic devices. New York City mayoral hopeful Bill Thompson speaks after voting in the Democratic primary election . The . mayoral campaign was waged in hundreds of candidate forums and across . millions of dollars of TV ads and was largely fought on the legacy of . the Bloomberg era. Substantial policy differences were scarce among the . Democrats, who agreed that the school system needed an overhaul, that . the city's poor had been forgotten, and that stop-and-frisk police . tactics used to stop suspicious people needed changing amid claims that . police unfairly targeted blacks and Latinos.

Three leading gyms have been forced to give their 1.4million members fairer and cheaper  cancellation rights. LA Fitness, Dave Whelan Sports and the Harlands Group will change the smallprint in contracts to make it easier to quit without being hit with punishing penalty charges. The move follows pressure from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and concern that some members were being charged fees of more than £500 to pull out. Locked in? If you are no longer able to go to the gym it may be easier now to cancel your contract . Bannatyne Fitness, which is owned by . the Dragons’ Den star Duncan Bannatyne, David Lloyd Leisure and Fitness . First, were required to end the same rip-off earlier this year. Fears . were raised after many contracts carried clauses that locked members . into long-term deals of up to 24 months and made it difficult to quit. Those . who suffer an injury, fall ill, lose their job or has to move for work . reasons can be hit with a cancellation bill equivalent to a full year of . payments. The new contracts, agreed with the OFT, give members extended rights to cancel their contracts early with a small penalty. Sales staff will also have to spell out more clearly the length of the initial contract period and the cancellation rights. The OFT is now writing to 20 other fitness operators warning them to ensure membership contracts are fair and clear. Cavendish . Elithorn, OFT Executive Director, said: 'As a result of our . investigation, millions of eligible gym members now have better contract . terms, including improved cancellation rights that prevent them being . unfairly locked in if their circumstances change. ‘This . should be a warning to the rest of the industry that we will not . hesitate to take action where we find evidence of consumers being . treated unfairly.’ Getting in shape: The changes follow an OFT investigation into the gym industry . He added that anyone who is considering joining a gym or health club should read the terms of the contract carefully before signing. ‘Alarm bells should ring if gyms are not being clear and upfront about their terms and conditions, including the length of the contract and cancellation rights,’ he said. ‘If consumers are told something that is not in the terms and conditions, they should ask for written confirmation.' The OFT said it would continue to monitor compliance alongside Trading Standards. It launched its investigation after a High Court ruling against a gym management company found lengthy membership periods could be unfair when they locked people in without adequate cancellation rights if their circumstances changed. Gillian Guy, chief executive at national charity Citizens Advice said: 'There is just no excuse for dodgy gyms locking customers into unreasonable contracts. We helped with over 3,000 problems with gyms and health clubs over the last year. We regularly hear from customers who have been ripped off by deals that have a nasty surprise in the fine print. 'Gyms need to be up front with their customers about what is involved in their membership contracts. Those gyms that still haven’t done so should follow the example of those giving better cancellation rights or risk a consumer backlash.' 1. How long is the contract? Carefully . consider the length of the contract and whether you are sure you want . to sign up for a year or whether a rolling monthly contract or . pay-as-you go would be more suitable. Membership costing £50 a month . will add up to £600 a year. 2. Can you cancel the contract early if your circumstances change or if you change your mind? Find . out if you can cancel the contract if your circumstances change. Some . gym providers allow you to cancel the contract or put it on hold under . certain circumstances such as if you are injured and unable to use the . facilities or if you lose your job. If the salesperson makes verbal . promises such as 'you can cancel your membership at any time', ask them . where this is set out in their terms and conditions or, if it is not, to . confirm the point in writing before you sign up. 3. Ask if the gym has a cooling-off period. Normally you can't cancel if you change your mind or stop using the gym . and will have to pay every month until you can cancel at the end of the . minimum term.4. Will the contract be automatically extended after the initial membership period? Most contracts for gym membership automatically continue once the initial membership period has expired. Make a note of the date by which you should inform them. You . should ask for some form of proof that the gym has received your . cancellation notice. For example, if you hand it in at the gym reception . desk, get a receipt.5. Do you have the time to go to the gym and can you afford the monthly payments? Make . sure you understand the commitment you are signing up for and that you . are sure the contract you have signed up for suits your needs.","Gym chains promise to be more upfront about the contract terms .

Mary Portas was last night accused of misleading Parliament about a £500,000 television fee she received following her government-backed review of Britain¿s high streets . Earlier this year Miss Portas made a series called Mary: Queen of the High Street for Channel 4, where she visited three of the towns trying to implement her plans. In written evidence to the influential Communities and Local Government Committee, published yesterday, Miss Portas insisted she had ‘misinterpreted’ the question. Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who sits on the committee, said: ‘It’s very disappointing that Mary Portas wasn’t straight with Parliament when asked about this. 'She’s always claimed she only did her high street review out of the goodness of her heart. Yet we now know she was paid handsomely by Channel 4 to make a television programme based on it.’ Miss Portas was asked several times during last week¿s hearing whether she had received £500,000 from Channel 4 . Miss Portas was asked several times during last week’s hearing whether she had received £500,000 from Channel 4.

She replied: ‘If I was getting £500,000 for Channel 4, let me tell you, I would be a happy woman. I am not. ‘Those numbers that they were bashing about – I am surprised you listen to the Daily Mail, Mr Danczuk, but never mind. I do not get that money, let me tell you.’ But after the hearing Miss Portas wrote to committee chairman Clive Betts, listing ‘things I believe require further clarification or correction’. She wrote: ‘The committee asked me if I was paid £500,000 by Channel 4. I misinterpreted this to mean for the Mary: Queen of the High Street series. 'My contract with Channel 4 covers two years with a requirement to make 20 episodes in total and amounts to £500,000.’ Mary: Queen of the High Street ran for only three episodes. Mr Danczuk, who had asked Miss Portas directly about the money, added: ‘There are not many people I know who could forget about a half-a-million-pound payment.’ 'Disappointing': Mary: Queen of the High Street ran for only three episodes . Following the Portas Review, published almost two years ago, 12 towns were selected to receive £1.2million of taxpayers’ cash for renewal schemes.

This is the moment an innocent puffin trying to feed its young was robbed by a greedy gull. Having scoured the Northumbrian coast for food, the helpless victim had not noticed a predator watching from a nearby rock. It was not until he hit the jackpot and set off for home clutching a batch of five sand eels that the gull made its move. Success: With a batch of sand eels in its iconic beak the doting parent gets ready to head home . Coast seems clear: He sets off, clutching the meal. Not far from his roost, it shouldn't be a long flight . Noticing a second too late, the puffin tried to change course. But the bigger bird was ready. In an alarming display of survival-of-the-fittest, the pair tumbled to the ground of the Farne Islands in a bid to win the meal. The incredible scene, captured by amateur photographer Steve Evans, escalated on dry land. The determined puffin made a run for it on foot. And despite being apprehended by the savvy gull, all was not lost for the breadwinner who proudly walked away with one of the two remaining fish. Puffin enthusiast Mr Evans, 50, said: 'I saw the gull spot the puffin whilst on a rocky outcrop, as it took to the air, the puffin saw it and tried to change direction. Shock: Out of nowhere a giant predator swoops. The black-headed gull tries to turn to grab the eels . Attacked: The puffin had caught some sand eels off the coast of the Farne Islands in Northumbria . 'The gull attempted to hood its wings around the puffin and pecked at its fish-laden bill. 'The gull managed to dislodge a small sand eel, as this dropped from the air another bird spotted it and got to it before the gull. 'The gull managed to get a fish from the puffin, once this happened the gull seemed to leave the puffin alone. 'It got back to its burrow with some fish intact.' Puffins are phenomenal swimmers and hunters as they adopt a flying technique under water. In the air, they beat their . wings rapidly, over 400 times-per-minute. Plan B: The tussle moves to dry land where the determined puffin tries to leg it with his food still intact . Relieved but exhausted: Usually known for its speed, this puffin only took home some of his earnings . The black-headed gull is an arch-nemesis of the Atlantic Puffin breed, which resides in the British Isles. To avoid danger, the black and white auks tend to fly together in confusing formations. Their fast pace and stark colours alarm predators. Fascinated by these black and white creatures, known for their super-fast swimming technique, Mr Evans from Wakefield, Yorkshire, planned this photography expedition months ago. Lucky: During the tussle a nearby tern made off with one of the prized snacks as the gull and puffin fought away . He said: 'For many years I have had an interest in the outdoors and the countryside, working several dogs on large Yorkshire estates. 'I have always had a liking for Puffins, this comical bird, but wanted to . photograph them during the breeding season when they spend time on land.' Lundy Island, the largest island in the Bristol Channel, near Devon, is named after the Norse word for 'puffin' Puffins are the symbol of Newfound and Labrador province in Canada, and the namesake of Lundy Island (from 'lund', the Norse word for puffin). The iconic birds are still hunted and eaten in the Faroe Islands and Iceland. There are three types of puffin, which are members of the auk family. The Tufted Puffin, an almost black creature, is native to the North Pacific. The Horned Puffin, with a fleshy horn above its beak, resides in cold climates like Siberia and Alaska. The Atlantic Puffin, or 'common puffin', is native to the North Atlantic and the British Isles. Puffins are known for their ability to swim. They soar through the water, flapping their wings as if flying through the air. In a technique unrivalled by other land-based creatures, the black and white creatures have become adept at hunting.","Puffin did not know predator was watching when he caught five sand eels off Farne Island coast near Northumbria .

McLaren's chairman, Ron Dennis, explained the move into road cars. He said: “McLaren’s first and founding principle was to compete successfully in motor sport and particularly Formula 1. 'That goal has taken us to great heights, from an engineering and innovation perspective, and by rewarding our people for their endeavours over many long seasons of top level motor racing.

A new smartphone app - nicknamed the iPlod - will allow the public to report crimes directly to the police. Every year hundreds of thousands of crimes - including burglary, theft and violent attacks - go unreported because victims can’t be bothered with the ‘hassle’ of calling the police. And last year around half a million calls to the non-emergency 101 number went unanswered because operators were too busy. Ministers want the police to be more efficient through the use of mobile technology. Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured with a neighbourhood policing team in South West London in 2010, was speaking at yesterday's Superintendents' Conference . The free app, which is named ‘Self Evident’, allows users to report the crime without making the call. The information - including the location of the crime, when it happened and the victim’s personal details, are then passed on to their local beat bobby or the police headquarters. The app was the idea of charity Witness Confident, which was set up to help improve relations between the public and the police. Guy Dehn, the charity’s director, said he hoped the app would improve levels of unreported crime and ensure the police get all the details they need. He said: ‘The Self Evident app is a state-of-the-art expression of Sir Robert Peel’s principle that ‘the police are the public, the public are the police’. ‘Self Evident makes it easy for the public to report crime, make statements and file evidence with the police simply and securely. An Apple iPhone - but the free app, which is named 'Self Evident', allows users to report the crime without making the call . ‘Mobile technology is an incredibly powerful tool and this app will put that power in the public’s hands so they can help cut crime in their area.’ The app is available to download on iPhones and Android smartphones. In London and Northumbria, crime reports filled in on the app will be sent to the police headquarters. Elsewhere, the data is sent directly to the neighbourhood police team via the police.uk website. The charity estimates that some 406,000 victims of crime do not report what happened to them because of the inconvenience. Ministers have said they want the police to be more efficient through the use of mobile technology. Yesterday Theresa May said officers would be able to use iPhones to get instant access to the Police National Computer - allowing them to remain on the beat while carrying out checks. In her speech to the Superintendents’ Conference yesterday she also pledged £50million for a new Police Innovation Fund designed to help pay for new inventions. She said IT was currently the ‘bane of every officer’s life’. ‘IT is central to efficient policing, and we are going to end the situation where a police officer either carries an out-of-date device that cannot link him to essential databases, or none at all. ‘It is soon going to be possible to connect a range of the most popular mobile devices to national policing systems - and without compromising security. ‘This will mean that officers will be able to use an iPhone (for instance) to get on to the PNC to check criminal and other records - which will increase their efficiency very considerably.’","Hundreds of thousands of crimes go unreported each year because .

Tsar: Louise Casey said it would be better for some families if parents got a job instead of having another baby . Mothers of large ‘troubled’ families should be marched to their GPs for advice on contraception, a senior Government adviser said yesterday.. Louise Casey said in many troubled families would be better if parents got a job and ‘having a baby might not be the best solution’. It came as figures showed the troubled families programme  which she runs had turned around the lives of 14,000 of England's most difficult households. Prime Minister David Cameron pledged £448 million to turn around the lives of the UK's 120,000 most troubled families following the 2011 riots which swept London and other English cities. The Department for Communities and Local Government said the latest figures showed local authorities were working with 50,000 families to reduce youth crime and truancy or help get adults back on the path to work - up from 35,000 in March. But Miss Casey, who worked for Tony Blair’s government before being hired by the coalition, said more had to be done to stop families having more and more children. Speaking at the launch of the latest figures, she said: ‘My own personal experience is that families with lots of children across lots of different age groups are stretched. ‘Managing a 21-year-old that's still living with you that's committing crime down to having another one that's two, anybody would see that that's a challenge. ‘Having a baby might not be the best solution, and actually doing something just for themselves like getting a job, getting on a course, getting their health sorted out could be the right thing to do. ‘The best family intervention gets into the family and helps them see what's the best way for them to go forward. Sometimes adding another child isn't right.’ Questioned if that should mean officials taking women to GPs’ surgeris for contraception advice, she added: ‘Yes that's right. I've come across cases where that's what some family intervention project workers have done, definitely.’ Councils are paid up to £4,000 for ‘turning around’ troubled families. Plan: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said he wanted to get people off the 'sofa of despair' Several measures must be met to receive the cash, including if children attend classes, adults are taken off benefits and the cost to public services is reduced. The latest figures were revealed by all 152 upper tier local authorities in England. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: ‘We’ll let local authorities look at the most difficult families – it’s very straightforward really. ‘It’s about getting children back into school, it’s about getting people off the sofa of despair and into work and it’s cutting down the amount of anti-social behaviour that families are committing, because often on some of the larger estates these families can be quite a nuisance.’","Louise Casey says having a baby 'might not be the best solution'

In trouble: Darius Ashard got abusive when he was ejected from Caesar's Bar in Great Yarmouth after staff allegedly saw him smoking cannabis . A dwarf who played Snoozy the dwarf in a pantomime starring Priscilla Presley hurled abuse at police after he was thrown out of a nightclub for taking drugs, a court heard. Darius Ashard, 22, was slung over a bouncer's shoulder and ejected from Caesar's Bar in Great Yarmouth after staff allegedly saw him smoking a joint. The 4ft 6in actor repeatedly called officers 'c****' after they were called to deal with the incident in Norfolk last month. Prosecutor Fergus Harold said Ashard also told a sergeant that he was a man 'who can't keep his missus happy'. Mr Harold added: 'He on many times calls them the C-word. I could go along on similar lines but it gets quite repetitive.' Ashard of Great Yarmouth admitted disorderly behaviour and was fined £40 with £45 costs, which will be deducted from his Jobseeker's Allowance benefits. He claimed he had only acted up because he thought he had been treated unfairly as he had not been smoking cannabis in the club. Ashard, representing himself in court, apologised for swearing, saying: 'That does sound pretty bad and the language used was inappropriate.' He added: 'I was ejected but it was under the suspicion of smoking cannabis and I wasn't. 'Security manhandled me, picked me up over his shoulder and threw me down. I didn't feel that I got fairly treated. 'I said I would like to make a complaint about the door staff but the sergeant said there was nothing I could do about that.' Ashard played dwarf Snoozy in a panto production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs alongside Priscilla Presley, 67, as the wicked queen in a two month run last Christmas at the New Wimbledon theatre, south London. Fellow dwarf Warwick Davies also starred in the show. Panto: Ashard spent Christmas in Croydon alongside Priscilla Presley but he is currently out of work .

Ashard  was given a 12 month community order and 40 hours unpaid work at Snaresbrook Crown Court in January after he admitted aggravated vehicle taking and handling stolen goods. The court heard how he had been a terrified passenger in a Vauxhall Astra which was taken in a burglary and screamed, 'I'm going to die' during a high speed police chase in August last year. He was arrested soon after the car was stopped and was caught with a stolen laptop and an iPad from a house in Woodford Green, Essex.

Robert Mugabe's party claimed a resounding victory in Zimbabwe's general election today moments before his main rival accused him of 'monumental fraud'. The election had been hailed as a potential turning point in the nation's troubled history as Mugabe's long-time nemesis Morgan Tsvangirai again vowed to dethrone the 89-year-old tyrant after 33 years in power. Wednesday's voting had been peaceful across the southern African nation, but the early claims from the competing parties heralded an acrimonious dispute over the outcome and raised fears of a repeat of violence that marred a 2008 election. Releasing unofficial results early in Zimbabwe is illegal, and police had said on Wednesday they would arrest anybody who made premature claims about the result.

'This has been a huge farce,' Tsvangirai said. 'In our view, that election is null and void.' He did not take questions, leaving it unclear whether he or his party will mount any kind of legal challenge.

At the dinner, Kali and her mother Traci said they were overwhelmed by the support from people as Kali recovered from the infection - making her only the third person to do so in the past 50 years.

She added that she is now looking forward to walking by herself again at her rehab sessions. Doctors said they are unsure whether or not she has sustained permanent brain damage. Kali was diagnosed with the harrowing form of meningitis caused by an amoeba called Naegleria fowleri, which expects believe swam into her body from warm, shallow water at a water park. Those who contract the parasitic infection rarely survive, so it's remarkable that Kali is alive, let alone able to say anything.

Fighter: Those who contract the parasitic . infection rarely survive, so it's remarkable that Kali is alive, let . alone able to say anything. Doctors have credited her mother's quick-thinking with the girl's survival . Her family has been updating her followers with news on a Prayers for Kali Le Ann Facebook page and posted an image of her out with her friends for dinner at the steak house. They have also shared photos of people from across the world who have thrown fundraisers for Kali. One group image shows scores of U.S. soldiers in Kuwait holding signs of support. Two weeks ago, her emotional mother wrote: 'Kali said 'Hi Mama' I was so happy that tears just started falling down my cheeks! 'Kali is doing so amazing and we are so proud if her! She just does something everyday that blows us away. I have such an amazing little girl and she has big things to do!!!!!' she added.

Support: A team of U.S. soldiers in Kuwait show their support by holding a sign reading: 'Kali's crew' Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is as rare as it is horrific. It is caused by an amoeba that implants itself in its victim's brains - usually when infected water shoots up their noses. The amoeba needs very specific conditions to thrive. It grows in the sediment at the bottom of pools of warm, stagnant water and is most active at about 85 degrees. The water must reach a relatively high temperature for the parasites to reach numbers that threaten humans. Health officials have recorded only 125 instances of the disease in the United States in the last 50 years. Only one person has survived in the United States. One other survivor was found in Mexico . Health officials say swimmers can reduce their risks even further by keeping their heads above water; using nose clips or holding the nose shut when the head is submerged; avoid stirring up sediment in shallow areas. Health officials believe Kali got sick after a trip to a now-shuttered Arkansas water park that features a sandy-bottomed lake. Naegleria fowleri (pronounced nuh-GLEER'-ee-uh FOW'-lur-ee) often is found in warm bodies of freshwater, such as lakes, rivers and hot springs. The amoeba typically enters the body through the nose as people are swimming or diving. It can then travel to the brain, causing a devastating infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis, or PAM. That's what Kali has been battling. Initial symptoms usually start within one to seven days and may include headache, fever, nausea and vomiting. The disease progresses rapidly, and other symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations. Moreover, the infection destroys brain tissue and can cause brain swelling and death. Doctors say Kali's success is due in large part to experimental treatment and early detection and diagnosis. Traci Hardig brought Kali to Arkansas Children's Hospital with a nasty fever on July 19 - and doctors have credited this fast thinking with her daughter's miraculous recovery. Battle: On August 14, the 12-year-old wrote: Kali Harding loves Daddy . Rare: The U.S. has recorded just 130 cases of Naegleria fowleri infections in the last 50 years . Doctors cooled Kali's body down to try to reduce the swelling, and they won clearance to treat her with a breast-cancer drug. Now, tests show no sign of the parasite in her system. 'It's . still a concern that she could certainly have some deficits long-term . and not function entirely as she would have if this had never happened,' one of her doctors, Dr. Vikki Stefans, said. Kali also is able to take a few steps with help at the hospital. 'She'll walk across the room to her wheelchair,' Traci Hardig said.

This is the Norfolk bolthole reportedly earmarked for parents-to-be the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, just a stone’s throw from the Queen’s own private residence at Sandringham. As revealed in the Mail last month, royal aides have been given planning permission to begin extensive improvements at Anmer Hall. Plans: Anmer Hall will have a raft of changes to accommodate the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their growing family, including a new 16ft x 16ft garden room and the planting of trees and shrubs . The Royal couple will have more privacy once changes have been made to their charming country house . These include a new garden room and a pergola made from stone columns with oak beams for plants to trail through, providing both shade and privacy on the patio area. More importantly, however, King’s Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council have also given the Queen, who is the Georgian mansion’s landlord, approval to re-route its existing driveway and plant dozens of new trees and shrubs to shield it from prying eyes. The ten-bedroom property is one of 150 situated on the monarch’s 20,000-acre Sandringham Estate in Norfolk and is only two miles east of Sandringham House, one of her favourite private residences. The hall, which largely dates back to 1802, was used as an illicit bolt-hole by Prince Charles and the then Camilla Parker-Bowles during their long-running affair when it was rented by the prince’s friend Hugh van Cutsem. Prince William, who is close to the van Cutsems’ children, is also said to have enjoyed many happy visits to the hall as a child. It also has something of a royal pedigree having been leased to the Duke and Duchess of Kent as their country house from 1972 until 1990. Its current tenant is businessman James Everett, who runs a kitchen worktop business from the grounds and has leased the property until 2017. It is likely he will be asked to move out early in order to carry out the necessary building works in time for the couple to move in, meaning the Queen may have to compensate him. The detailed planning application for Anmer Hall, described as a ‘major development’ in council papers, cannot be seen on the council website for security reasons and anyone wishing to view them has to be vetted by police. Prince William and Kate Middleton will live just two miles from where the Royal Family celebrate Christmas . The Queen has gifted the couple a stunning mansion . Council officers approved the plans under delegated powers, which means they did not have to go through the usual council planning process. According to the application an existing wood store will be converted into extra accommodation - mostly likely for police officers guarding the property - while a garage block will be transformed into an equipment room. Other plans involve moving the main gates to the property further down a lane so members of the public will not be able to get so close to the house. The new, longer private driveway will sweep across an existing field, currently used as grazing land, before reaching the front of the house, which has its own swimming pool and tennis court. A new gate will be built across what is currently a public road and a lawn taken out to create extra parking space. The current public entrance to nearby St Mary’s Church will become accessible only to the Duke and Duchess, with the approach road re-routed to create a new entrance for worshippers. To compensate them the Queen will pay for a new car park to be built. Although both Buckingham and St James’s Palaces have refused to comment on the plans, it has emerged this week that the new pergola and garden room will be designed by architect Charles Morris, who was behind a controversial extension for Prince Charles at his own country home. Mr Morris, whose ancestors were responsible for building the Royal Albert Hall, built the Orchard Room at Highgrove in Gloucestershire, which is used by Charles for entertaining but has been described as a ‘Wimpey house’. The Sandringham Estate has been owned by the Queen since her accession in 1952 and by the Royal Family since 1862. Although much of the land is open to the public, the paparazzi are no longer allowed to photograph the Royal family relaxing there, making it even more attractive to the Duke and Duchess.","Will have a pergola and shrubbery to shield their home .

Generous: Former postman William Cameron left £65,000 to the care home which looked after him - and the money has now grown to £637,000 . Pensioners living in a remote care home in the Scottish Highlands are set to receive a £637,000 windfall thanks to a former resident who died more than 30 years ago. Veteran postman William Cameron, who passed away in 1983, left his entire £65,000 savings to Auchernack Home in Forres where he had lived during his final years. But when the home closed 12 years ago, the money effectively lay dormant. The restrictive wording of Mr Cameron's will meant it could not be transferred to the new home which replaced Auchernack, named Cameron Court in his honour. After years of legal wrangling, local council bosses have finally been able to put the money into a trust fund and allow it to be disbursed. During the time it has been left untouched, the money has grown by a staggering 880% because of interest rates and is now worth around £637,000. Little is known about how Mr Cameron - . known as ‘Willie’ to pals - managed to save up £65,000 before his death . as he only ever earned as much as £20 a week during his 50 year stint as . a postman between 1908 and 1958. One of his workmates George Lilley recalled that William never had any children, never smoked . and never drank, which is why he had more money than most. According to George, William’s idea of a night out was to pop down to the British Legion for a game of snooker. But George believes most of William’s . money was probably inherited as he had a big family, with one brother working in . India and another dabbling in stocks and shares. William, who started his service as an . auxiliary postman at Brodie, Moray, on November 28, 1908, was said to . have cycled 205,000 miles and walked about 50,000 miles in the course of . his duty as a postman. Windfall: Residents of Cameron Court care home in Forres, Scotland, are set to benefit from a £637,000 investment . In limbo: The money Mr Cameron left to Aubechernack Home, pictured as it is today, was untouched for years due to legal difficulties . In 1913, he became a full-time . employee at Brodie, but his term was disrupted when he joined the . Cameron Highlanders in 1915 and served in France during the First World . War. He was twice wounded, in 1917 and 1918, and in 1919 was discharged. When he returned home he worked as a . postman in Forres where he remained until he retired in 1958 where he . was given a clock for his 50 years of service and had ‘For He’s a Jolly . Good Fellow’ sung to him at a ceremony. William spent his final few years at Auchernack and died at Leanchoil Hospital, Forres, in 1982, aged 86. The terms of his will read simply: 'I leave and bequeath the whole residue of my said means and estate to Auchernack Home, Forres.' The money even went missing for seven years after Grampian Regional Council, which was holding on to the cash, was broken up in March 1996 to become Moray District Council. Old friend: Former workmate George Lilley suggested William Cameron may have saved up his fortune by living an austere lifestyle . Kind-hearted: William Cameron, pictured on his last round as a postman in 1958, cycled thousands of miles during his career . By the time it was found again in 2003, Auchernack had closed down and the money - which had already risen in value to a staggering £345,000 by then - was untouchable. Moray Council chiefs today confirmed their solicitors had managed to set up a trust fund to put the money in which will be used to help look after the elderly in Forres. A spokesman said: 'Following lengthy negotiations, the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator has approved the council’s application to vary the terms of the bequest to enable funds to be disbursed. 'The application for charitable status for what had become known as the Auchernack Trust was made late last year and confirmation has now been received that it has been approved. 'The revised terms of the bequest now allows it to be used for the benefit of the elderly community in the Forres area and for the ""relief of those in need by reason of advanced age"".' Jenny Pulford, a support worker at Cameron Court said: 'Willie wanted Auchernack to receive the money after he was gone as he was so grateful for the support they gave him there. 'That money made such a difference to Auchernack, until it shut. 'Although eight or nine of the residents actually moved from there to Cameron Court when it shut, Willie’s money wasn’t able to be transferred - all we got in the end was Auchernack’s old bus. 'So I think it’s absolutely brilliant that the money will see the light of day again. Willie left this money for the elderly of Forres and finally it’s them that will receive it again. 'I think he would proud to see this news today, it’s what he always wanted.'","William Cameron left £65,000 savings to Auchernack care home in Scotland .

The family of an eight-year-old boy with narcolepsy are blaming the swine flu vaccine for his sleep disorder. Ben Foy suddenly falls asleep up to 20 times a day and often collapses without warning. His mother Lindsey, 33, and grandfather Brian Hamilton, 60, say he has also become bad tempered and blame his condition on the swine flu jab Pandemrix. Ben Foy's mother, Lindsey, 33, believes that he developed narcolepsy after having the swine flu vaccine. He now falls asleep up to 20 times a day and collapses if he gets excited . The vaccine was given to almost a million children under the age of five in 2009 and 2010 before being withdrawn because of its links with narcolepsy. Ms Foy, a mother-of-three, said: ‘Before Ben had the jab he was a very healthy little boy. It was only after that he started showing symptoms of narcolepsy. ‘It started gradually and at first he just seemed more tired than usual. ‘He'd just started a new school year so we thought that might be causing it and didn't think much of it. ‘Soon after, he started falling asleep and his teacher told us he kept napping at his desk and they would struggle to wake him up. ‘He found it exhausting to walk home from school and he started collapsing so we knew it was something serious.’ Mr Hamilton, a chauffeur, said: ‘Since Ben had the jab it has been an absolute nightmare for us.’ Ben does not only have narcolepsy, he has also developed cataplexy - a sudden loss of strength triggered by a strong emotion such as excitement. Ms Foy says that Ben has also become bad tempered and she blames his condition on the swine flu jab Pandemrix. She says that before he had the injection he was a 'very healthy little boy' He had the injection in January 2010 and started showing the first symptoms the following September. Doctors sent him for tests - including CT scans, sleep studies, MRI scans, blood tests, a lumbar puncture and an ECG - before he was diagnosed with narcolepsy two years later. Ms Foy, from York, said: ‘For two years doctors didn't seem to know what was wrong with Ben, which was very distressing for us. ‘He would fall asleep up to twenty times a day and he started having mood swings. ‘When he was younger we used to call him . the little Peter Kay, he was very funny and happy. Now he has really . changed and he can be bad tempered. Ms Foy says she knew Ben had narcolepsy before he was even diagnosed because she had read about the link between the injection and the condition . ‘It was only when I read about narcolepsy and its possible link to the swine flu jab that the penny dropped. ‘As soon as we saw it we just knew that was it. It was like someone was describing Ben. ‘The doctors had to carry out their tests before they could make an official diagnosis but it didn't come as a shock at all when they told us he had narcolepsy. We already knew it."" Ben's family chose to treat his condition without the use of prescription drugs until May this year. Mr Hamilton explained: ‘The drugs initially offered to Ben are linked to anti-depressants and have very serious side effects. ‘They are drugs you don't want a child taking if it can be avoided and so we went down the track of trying to alter and manage his lifestyle to combat the symptoms. ‘We took him to a child psychiatrist and altered his diet. We also noticed that it was when Ben would get excited that he would collapse so we tried to manage that. ‘The only thing he had to stop doing completely was playing football because he kept collapsing on the pitch. ‘We were worried for his safety so he had to stop playing for around two years. ‘Now he's older, he's able to recognise himself when he's going to collapse and he takes a few minutes out of the game so he has just started playing again. ‘We have to keep a close eye on him when he's doing things like having a bath or crossing the road but we've managed his condition as a family really well and Ben takes it in his stride. Narcolepsy, which occurs in one in every 2,000 people, is a sleep disorder that causes a person to suddenly fall asleep at inappropriate times. It is a long-term neurological condition that disrupts normal sleeping patterns. Symptoms include, sleep attacks, daytime sleepiness and cataplexy - temporary muscle weakness in response to emotion. It is often caused by an autoimmune response - this is when antibodies are released by the body but instead of destroying disease, they attack healthy cells. In the case of narcolepsy, antibodies attack the areas of the brain that produce a sleep-regulating chemical. There is currently no cure but the condition can sometimes be managed, for example, by taking regular naps, eating healthily and exercising. In some cases, medications such as antidepressants or stimulants can also help. It is thought that for every 55,000 children who were given the jab, Pandemrix, one has developed narcolepsy. Researchers, who published their findings in the British Medical Journal, studied 75 children with narcolepsy and found that 11 of these had received the vaccine before their symptoms began. The vaccine is associated with a 14-fold increase in a child's risk of developing the condition. Since 2011, the Department of Health has prevented the use of Pandemrix in people under the age of 20. ‘We can usually see when he's about to . collapse because his expression changes, his eyes glaze over and he . starts to slur his words. ‘There are good days and bad days and sometimes he does get upset but on the whole he's fantastic at coping with it. ‘What he's doing during the day really impacts upon how bad his condition is.’ Ben's family eventually decided to . try prescription drugs on a trial basis as they were concerned he would . be bullied as he got older. They . were first told he could have the drugs modifinal and sodium oxybate . but modifinal has been stopped on medical grounds and the NHS has now . said it can no longer fund the sodium oxybate. Initially Ben's family decided to treat his narcolepsy with diet changes as they were worried about the side effects of medication. They then became concerned that he might be bullied so he is now on medication . The youngster's case has gone before a medical panel who are to rule on whether he can be given the medicine on an individual basis. Mr Hamilton added: ‘If he can't get the . medication he's not going to have the same chance as the lad next door. He needs this medicine to keep up with the kids at school. The chance of developing narcolepsy after receiving a dose of the vaccine is somewhere between one in 52,000 and one in 52,750 . ‘The condition is a particularly distressing for both patient and family to endure. ‘I hope Ben's case will help raise awareness of the link between narcolepsy and the swine flu jab and eventually force the NHS to take responsibility and compensate families like ours.’ An NHS spokesperson said: ‘It is important to point out that the risk of narcolepsy is thought to be extremely low. ‘The researchers estimate that the chance of developing narcolepsy after receiving a dose of the vaccine is somewhere between one in 52,000 and one in 52,750. ‘Due to the results of previous studies, Pandemrix is no longer given to those under 20.’ So far, across the country, 11 children have been identified as possibly having developed narcolepsy after having the injection. While for the vast majority of children the swine flu jab proved harmless and effective, the UK Health Protection Agency has found that giving the jab to young children increases their chance of developing narcolepsy by 14 times. It may be that the children affected would have developed narcolepsy later in life without the injection. No one knows for sure. What is known is that by 2011 there was already sufficient concern over the potential link for the Department of Health to issue new guidelines banning the vaccination for anyone under the age of 20.","Ben Foy falls asleep up to 20 times a day and collapses if he gets excited .

A couple whose son was born without a diaphragm are reeling after doctors revealed their unborn second child will have the same severe condition - a one in 50,000 chance. Neil and Amy Rubenstein's son Aiden, now three, was born with a severe case of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH). The condition usually causes a hole to develop in the baby’s diaphragm - but Aiden was born with no diaphragm at all and had to have a new one made out of sports clothes fabric. Neil and Amy Rubenstein have been told that their unborn child has the same diaphragm abnormality that their son Aiden, three, suffers from. The condition is not thought to be genetic . The family, from Chicago in Illinois, U.S., were shocked when doctors diagnosed their unborn second child with the same condition - just 20 weeks into the pregnancy. ‘It was like a bomb that hit us. Neither of us could speak,’ said Mrs Rubenstein. ‘I had to be peeled off the examination table by Neil. We were hysterical.’ Aiden has been undergoing treatment at the Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago under the care of paediatric surgeon Dr Marieta Reynolds. She said: ‘In my 30 years of working with CDH patients, I have never seen a family with two children with this same condition.’ At present, no-one knows what causes CDH, which kills more than half of its sufferers. Aidan was born without a diaphragm because he has a severe case of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia. The condition normally causes children to be born with a hole in their diaphragm . The couple learned during Mrs Rubenstein's 20 week scan that their second child has the same condition. They say they were so shocked that they could not speak . Patients must undergo surgery that closes the hole by either stitching together the muscle or using Gore-Tex fabric, which is used in waterproof clothing. But as a result, they suffer with pulmonary hypertension – high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs - and underdeveloped lungs, meaning they find it difficult to breathe independently. There is no suggestion CDH is genetic, which makes the Rubenstein's diagnosis all the more shocking. Aiden's surgeon, Marieta Reynolds, said: 'In my 30 years of working with CDH patients, I have never seen a family with two children with this same condition' Aiden had a diaphragm created out of Gore-Tex - a material that is usually used for making sports clothing . Mrs Rubenstein spoke about when the baby was diagnosed. She said: 'It was like a bomb that hit us. Neither of us could speak. I had to be peeled off the examination table by Neil. We were hysterical' They had already undergone five years of fertility treatments in an attempt to avoid passing on a gene that Mrs Rubenstein carries for neurofibromatosis – a genetic condition that causes tumours to grow along the nerves. The fertility treatments did not work and they conceived Aidan naturally - but the neurofibromatosis gene was not passed on. Today, Aiden has all the appearance of a healthy child, but the family live in constant fear that his diaphragm could rupture or that he could twist his intestine. Mr Rubenstein said: ‘When you see how well Aidan is doing now you can't imagine how touch-and-go it was at one time, how sick he was. Mr and Mrs Rubenstein say they live in fear of Aiden's diaphragm rupturing. They say that he is now just like any other child other than for his scar . Before Aiden (pictured in hospital as a baby) was conceived naturally, his parents had five years of failed fertility treatments in an attempt to produce a child without a genetic condition that Mrs Rubenstein carries. Luckily, he does not have it . Mr and Mrs Rubenstein say they will approach their new baby's illness with the same optimism that helped them cope with Aiden's. Image shows an ultrasound scan of the baby . ‘If you see him, apart from his scar, you wouldn't think that there was ever anything wrong with him.’ The couple are determined to raise awareness of the condition, which affects as many children as cystic fibrosis. So much so, that they have donated two of their frozen embryos to CDH research in the hope of finding the cause of the condition. And while they find themselves facing the same heart-breaking fight again, they have vowed to face it with the same optimism and vigour that has given Aiden a second chance at life. CDH is a hole in the diaphragm that allows organs from the abdomen to move into the chest. This prevents the normal development of the lungs meaning the baby will struggle to breathe when it is born. In severe cases, no diaphragm is present at all. CDH affects about one in every 2,500 babies. It is often diagnosed during a routine pregnancy ultrasound - otherwise it will be picked up when the baby is born and struggles to breathe. The outlook for babies with CDH is increasingly positive with new surgical techniques being developed. It is not known what causes CDH. It can lead to complications including chronic lung disease, failure to thrive and developmental delays. Babies with the condition require surgery to repair the hole and return the organs to the abdominal cavity.","Aiden Rubenstein has Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia .

An autistic boy's life has been transformed by his best friend - a pet lizard called Spike. Callum Lake has Asperger syndrome, a form of autism which affects the way he communicates with, and relates to, others. The condition means the 10-year-old struggles to read people's emotions and to understand social situations, making it difficult for him to make friends at school. Callum Lake has become more confident and independent since he got Spike. The creature has also helped him to deal better with anxiety and to make friends . But in recent months, Callum's mother, Karen Beech, has noticed dramatic changes in her son's character, which she attributes to his new pet gecko. Callum, from Hurdsfield, in Cheshire, is responsible for looking after Spike, which has given him more independence and greater confidence in his own abilities. Spike has also given Callum something to focus on when he gets anxious, which has helped him keep calm, and helped him strike up conversations with his classmates at school. Callum said: ‘Looking after Spike is really fun. I've started getting up really early in the mornings so I can sit and eat my breakfast with him before school. Callum said: 'Looking after Spike is really fun. I've started getting up really early in the mornings so I can sit and eat my breakfast with him before school' ‘I feed Spike worms but my mum has to feed him crickets because I don't like them jumping around.’ Miss Beech, 38, said: ‘Callum had always had a special interest in dinosaurs. ‘One day he asked for one and a lizard seemed like the next best thing so we bought Spike. ‘As soon as Callum held him, he fell in love with him. He's his best friend. ‘Supporting people with autism, like Callum, who can and do want to form friendships goes a long a way towards ending the isolation that many people with the condition feel. ‘Spike may be small, but he has had a huge impact on Callum's life and it's heart-warming to see him so much more confident and independent with family and at home.’ Callum lives with his mother, her partner Mark, 41, and sister Niamh, six. He was diagnosed two years ago after four years of investigations by health specialists. Miss Beech, a teaching assistant, said: ‘When he was young we thought Callum was a “pipe and slippers” person, someone who just liked things a certain way. ‘He didn't cope with change very well. When he went to school teachers noticed his problems with communication, avoiding eye contact, and we started looking at what could be the issue. ‘Although it was hard to hear Callum had Asperger syndrome, it was a relief that we had an answer and could start supporting him.’ Miss Beech is also an ambassador for the National Autistic Society, the UK's leading charity for people affected by autism. Callum's mother, Karen, said: 'Callum had always had a special interest in dinosaurs. One day he asked for one and a lizard seemed like the next best thing so we bought Spike. As soon as Callum held him, he fell in love with him. He's his best friend' Researchers at the Hospital Research Centre of Brest in France believe that the social skills of children with autism improve if they have a pet. The scientists found that children with the disorder are better able to comfort other people and to share their possessions if they have a pet. It is thought that this could be because introducing a pet into a family increases family bonds and interaction.","Callum Lake, 10, was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome two years ago .

A woman has told how a pioneering treatment allowed her to have a life-saving kidney transplant. Tracey West, 51, who had chronic renal failure, has received a new kidney from her father, Michael, 71, despite the fact he has a different blood type. Until a few years ago, this would not have been possible as her body would have rejected the organ. Scroll down for video . Tracey West, 51, was given a new kidney by her father, Michael, 71, after a new procedure made the operation possible. It would not previously have been possible because they have different blood types . In 2006, Ms West’s life was turned upside down when she was diagnosed with kidney failure. She had been suffering from severe headaches for a year but assumed that they were migraines. Eventually, however, her partner encouraged her to go to her GP and she was diagnosed with renal failure which would have proved fatal without treatment. Ms West, from Portsmouth, told ITV’s This Morning: 'My life was normal, you know, I was working, I was going out, having barbecues and all the normal things in life. ‘So, I knew no different. I was taking my health for granted at the time and I was taking my life for granted.’ She added: 'I went in to see the GP with what I thought was a migraine and came out with chronic renal failure.' Ms West was diagnosed with kidney failure after developing chronic headaches. For a year she had to spend six to eight hours every night on dialysis. She believed she would have to wait for a deceased donor as none of her family were matches . As a result, Ms West was put on the organ transplant waiting list and had to spend six to eight hours every night on dialysis because her kidneys were unable to clean her blood. She said: 'It keeps you alive but it doesn’t give you life. It doesn’t give you the energy to have a normal life.' All of Ms West’s family were tested to see if they could give her a kidney, but none were suitable matches. After she had been on dialysis for a year, Ms West’s father, Michael, read an article in the newspaper which reported that medics had managed to carry out a successful kidney transplant using a donor with a different blood type. He immediately called the hospital to establish whether this would mean that he could give his daughter one of his kidneys. Ms West (pictured before her illness) said: 'My life was normal, I was working, I was going out, having barbecues and all the normal things in life. I was taking my health for granted at the time and I was taking my life for granted' Mr West told This Morning: 'It was just so debilitating for her but through it all you are aware that this is not Tracey as she is, this is Tracey as an ill person and you tell yourself that.' He added: ‘For me, I just wanted to see her well again. That was what I wanted and that’s what we got.' Surgeons at Portsmouth’s Queen Alexandra Hospital carried out the transplant in April this year. Ms West said: ‘I haven’t looked back since the op, I really haven’t. It’s been incredible for me. It gave me my life back. ‘The day after the operation, I woke up and I was on the phone at six in the morning ringing my mum to say hi. I felt incredible. You get your life back straight away. 'I probably feel better now - I can’t remember ever feeling as good because I was feeling ill for so long.' The transplant operation was carried out at Queen Alexandra Hospital after Mr West read an article which reported that a successful transplant between people with different blood types had been carried out . Her father added: ‘I feel as though nothing has happened, it was just so routine. It was something that anybody could do.' Until recently, transplants between people with different blood groups were impossible. With kidney transplants, not only did the blood group have to match, but the tissue type, too. If the blood types did not match, the organ would be rejected. Rejection is caused by antibodies — proteins found in blood or other bodily fluids that act as the body’s natural defence. They identify and neutralise foreign objects, such as bacteria and viruses, but also body tissue and blood groups that are different. Ms West (pictured with her father Michael, surgeon Paul Gibbs, and Peter Andre on This Morning) said: 'I haven't looked back since the op, I really haven't. It's been incredible for me. It gave me my life back' The new procedure involves 'washing' the blood to remove the antibodies that cause the organ to be rejected so it no longer matters what blood type the donor is. It’s thought 30 per cent of patients waiting for a kidney are being held back because though they have a live donor with the right tissue type, their blood types don’t match. This technique means these patients can come off the waiting list. The key to success is ensuring all the antibodies — from the patient and the donor organ — are removed before the transplant and do not return. First, patients take drugs to stop their body producing antibodies and undergo a blood cleaning process, where the antibodies that cause rejection are filtered out. The drug the patient is given, rituximab, suppresses antibody production. This is administered ahead of the transplant along with other anti-rejection drugs. Then the patient is attached to a machine to filter their blood of plasma — this is the liquid in blood that contains antibodies. Before the patient’s blood is passed back into their body, donated plasma is added — known as plasma exchange. The procedure takes three to four hours and is carried out on alternate days for a week before the transplant, and for two days afterwards. After the transplant, patients need to take immuno-suppressive drugs for life. Mr Paul Gibbs, a renal surgeon at Queen Alexandra Hospital, told This Morning: ‘Before this procedure, if you came forward as a live donor but your recipient and you didn’t match from a blood group point of view then it wasn’t possible to do the transplant, but now it is. 'We've perfected this now within kidneys and now with the work being done with live liver transplants and live lung transplants hopefully it will allow the technology to be expanded to those areas as well.' He added: ‘It is only within the last few years that it’s been genuinely successful.’ Until recently, transplants between people with different blood groups were impossible as the recipient's body would reject the organ. Rejection is caused by antibodies — proteins found in blood and other bodily fluids that act as the body’s natural defence. They identify and neutralise foreign objects, such as bacteria and viruses, but also body tissue and blood groups that are different.

Thom Browne, a designer who attracted worldwide acclaim last January when Michelle Obama wore his custom design to her husband’s second inauguration, staged his semiannual womenswear fashion show early Monday evening. Mr Browne, a long-time favorite within the fashion industry as well as the Asian commercial market, stunned audiences with his dream-like take on what was ‘loosely based off of Elizabethan clowns’ he told MailOnline before his show began. The procession, fabricated nearly entirely in white fabric (sometimes supplemented with hints of navy), was a study in both dramatic referencing and textural interest. Pale and interesting: Thom Browne's collection was mostly fabricated in white, with some navy flourishes . Challenge: The collection was a study in both dramatic referencing and textural interest . ‘It was a challenge to do it [in all white]’ Mr Browne told us backstage. ‘Especially to have forty looks that had very different textures within them.’ He staged the show in an equally . white-washed room, built to resemble a mental institution, with padded . and tiled walls. A small handful of models dressed in Mr Browne’s take . on nurses’ uniforms emerged first, each administering small plastic cups . of white M&M’s (presumably in place of Lithium) to amused audience . members. Seal of approval: Thom Browne designed Michelle Obama's ensemble for President Obama's second inauguration . Then came the hospital’s patients, dressed in an array of boned nipped-waist looks, armed with high-neck collars, confused (or sometimes narcissistic) stares, and the kind of intricate detailing that would rival collections from any of Europe’s great fashion houses. Many of the silhouettes on display were similar to the ones utilized by Mr Browne in his last few womenswear collections—which makes sense, as he’s a classicist at heart. ‘I never pay attention to any kinds of trends or anything,’ he told us. ‘I just think that preppy Americana feels good and that it’s kind of timeless and it’s what I like.’ Much like his flair for showmanship, . Mr Browne has never been one to shy away from a strong preppy hand. Showering his army of lacy clowns in small anchors, pearls, and penny . loafer heels was the least of his challenges this season. ‘I just do it’ he said of his process for layering references. In . sending his models to a metal facility, Mr Browne explored the more . pervasive qualities of his own work. His clothes have a consistently . disturbing quality to them, often aided by extreme hair and make-up . techniques. But by dressing up his models in smeared red lipstick, . chokingly-tight latex collars, and woven wicker petticoats, Mr Browne . aired his fashion disturbances with an even stronger edge. ‘I . do my shows and the more conceptual part of what I do to make the . commercial side more interesting,’ he told us. ‘And even as conceptual . as they are, they are seriously made as really classic pieces of . clothes.’ Attention to detail: Mr Browne examines his designs backstage before Monday's womenswear show . That much may be true—sheath dresses, . tailored blazers, and closely-shorn pencil skirts all lay at the root of . Mr Browne’s sartorial intellect for spring. Their fabrications however, added to the . collection’s otherworldly sense. Fortuny-like pleated chiffons, cobwebby . laces, and 3-D tweeds took Mr Browne’s designs to another dimension. As . did a honeycomb-like material that likely pleased many of the . audience’s many Japanese members, many of which came dressed in . head-to-toe Thom Browne looks (the fabric strongly resembled the foam . material traditionally used to wrap and protect Japanese peaches). Timeless: Boxy handbags and penny loafer heels had their roots in preppy Americana . Setting the stage: Mr Browne's designs have a consistently disturbing quality to them, often aided by extreme hair and make-up techniques . Ghostly presence: Thom Browne offered a haunting all-white collection for spring 2014 . But most importantly (at least for Mr Browne’s sake) is how his show’s enormous audience proved that his womenswear label is gaining serious ground in both the commercial and critical realms. In the last few seasons, it’s seemed to at least double in size. ‘Michelle Obama definitely helped,’ Mr Browne told us of his womenswear’s escalating success. ‘It feels good, I am very serious about making good clothes for women, so I like to see that they appreciate it.’","Thom Browne's womenswear line got a high-profile endorsement earlier this year, when the First Lady wore a custom creation to the President's second inauguration .

Between sleepless nights, nappy changing and post-natal blues, getting back to work is often the last thing on the minds of new mothers. Fully immersing oneself in the world of new parenthood can be all-consuming. So it's perhaps understandable that when mothers do eventually return to the office, it takes them at least four months to get back up to speed. According to a new study, six in 10 mothers find readjusting to the workplace challenging, with an average of 3.8 months required to get back into the swing of things. Challenging: It takes the majority of new mothers at least four months to get back up to speed at work . The study also revealed that many mothers share similar concerns about returning to work - chief among them the fear that they might bore childless colleagues with baby talk. Other mothers panicked about accidentally arriving at work with fingerprints and food stains on their clothes, while 17 per cent said they were worried about missing their child. On a more positive note, just 10 per cent thought they might run into trouble with their boss by making regular calls to their childminder. Of the new mothers who do choose to return to work, 40 per cent said they do so because of financial pressure. But three quarters admitted that they wouldn't be happy to go out to work if it meant their partner stayed at home instead. 'Returning to work can be a daunting shift and can lead to feelings of . insecurity and lack of confidence,' said psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos. Advice: Dr Linda Papadopoulos says mothers shouldn't feel guilty. RIGHT, Kirsty Allsopp says a glamorous makeover with new haircut, clothes and a handbag helped boost her confidence before returning to work . 'As well as worrying about getting . back into the job you also have to juggle childcare needs. Get into a . routine so that the mornings run smoothly.' She continued: 'Lay clothes out the night . before, fill the kettle up and put things by the front door that you . need to remember. 'When at work don’t be afraid to ask questions, nobody . is going to expect you to know everything on your first day back.' The survey, which was carried out by Proctor & Gamble, found that new mothers employed a variety of ways to boost their confidence, including splashing out on new clothes and a new hair cut. Others said having an early night, wearing their favourite outfit and updating their hair colour also helped. Among those to treat themselves ahead of a return to the office was homes guru and P&G Everyday Effect ambassador, Kirstie Allsopp. 'I had a new hairstyle, new clothes and bought a new handbag both times,' she revealed. 1. Let go of any feelings of guilt . about going back to work.

As with any big change, nerves are inevitable, but remember all the . things that you enjoyed about your working life before parenthood and . focus on the positive transferable skills that you’ve learned from having . your child. 3. Balancing . work and home life is a challenge that we all face. Discuss your options . with your partner and family and friends, and have back up plans in . case something crops up at work or at home. 4.

Angry: Film blogger Alex Billington called 911 when an audience member would not stop using his phone during a movie . A film critic became so enraged at a fellow moviegoer using his cellphone during a screening yesterday that he called 911. Alex Billington, a leading blogger who founded FirstShowing.net, claims he was worried that a man who was using his phone non-stop for 10 minutes was trying to record the film. But some have accused him of wasting the police's time by using the emergency number to report such a trivial matter. The incident occurred on Monday during a screening of new thriller The Sacrament during the Toronto International Film Festival. The screening was attended by film critics and industry workers, meaning that electronic devices were permitted to enable journalists to take notes. A member of the audience sitting in the front row of the cinema was apparently using his phone to send texts and emails throughout the opening of the movie, angering Mr Billington. After theatre staff told him they were powerless to intervene, the blogger dialled 911 to warn that the man could be pirating the film, which is due to be released in the U.S. later this year. However, the emergency dispatcher simply laughed at him, while cinema employees suggested he should return for a public screening where phones are not allowed. Mr Billington subsequently took to Twitter to launch a furious tirade against the use of cellphones during movies. 'I was afraid this would reach a head and this is it,' he wrote. 'They claim nothing can be done to ""change the policy"" in 2013 because it's allowed.' Defence: The blogger quoted Steve Jobs as he defended his over-the-top reaction to the etiquette breach . While . some other prominent film bloggers stood up for him, he also faced a . backlash from people who suggested that he should not have involved the . police in the matter. Scott Weinberg tweeted: '911 is for emergencies, you embarrassingly unprofessional attention-starved stooge.' Peter Sciretta added: 'Dude, I agree they shouldn't be on their phones but 911 is for serious emergencies only.' Mr Billington fiercely defended himself, . writing: 'If it's wrong to report potential piracy to authorities, then . how will piracy ever be stopped. If it's not taken seriously, it will . remain.' Film: Mr Billington was attending a screening of The Sacrament, whose creators are pictured here at the Venice film festival . He later struck a more extravagant tone, quoting Steve Jobs to say: 'You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things.' The critic told Buzzfeed that he had not overreacted, and insisted he was highlighting a serious issue. 'I thought I might be witnessing an act of piracy, a major crime being committed, and wished to report it to the proper authorities,' he said.

If you think adverts on Facebook are annoying, get ready to see them pop up in your Instagram feed too because the company has announced plans to sell advertising by 2014. Instagram's director of business operations Emily White told the Wall Street Journal the company is looking at ways to make money and intends to introduce adverts 'within the next year.'

Facebook took a swipe at rival Twitter in June by launching Video on Instagram. Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 and Twitter owns the video-sharing app Vine. Video on Instagram added a Vine-style video icon to the existing Instagram app and users can record 15-second video clips and edit them together for longer videos. There are also 13 new filters to give the videos the same retro feel as Instagram's pictures. Twitter’s hugely popular Vine app lets users record and share six-second clips. White said: 'We want to make money in the long term, but we don't have any short-term pressure.' It is thought the adverts could appear in Instagram's Explore tab, which shows people what other user's are clicking on and liking. Alternatively, they could appear when users search for a specific hashtag or picture as sponsored or promoted links. Further down the line advertisers may also be able to make advert images clickable so users can go directly to the site and buy the product being advertised. Instagram was bought by Facebook in April 2012 and is said to have been looking at ways of monetising the app ever since.

As Anthony Weiner's . floundering mayoral campaign rambled on Friday, posters began popping up . around New York City mocking the disgraced candidate's public relations . woes. The comedy website Funny or Die posted images of a hilarious mock ad seeking interns for Weiner's campaign. According . to the posters that are widely believed to have been concocted and . plastered around Manhattan by Funny or Die humorists themselves, the . embattled mayoral hopeful is seeking staffers who are not 's***bags,' 'snitches' or 'cops.' Silent: Anthony Weiner yesterday refused to comment on his controversial spokeswoman Barbara Morgan . Hasty retreat: The mayoral candidate climbed into a waiting SUV without answering reporters' questions . Under 'qualifications', the authors of . the fake wanted ad listed, among other skills, 'organized and . details-oriented, discreet and no gag reflex,' the site Red Alert Politics reported. 'For . more information, report to the loading area behind the docks at . sundown and make sure you are not followed,' the printed sign . instructed. The bogus . flyers are a play on comments made by Weiner’s Communications Director . Barbara Morgan, who reportedly called former intern Olivia Nuzzi a . 'f***ing s***bag' and 'fame-hungry b****' for publishing an expose . about her experience working for Anthony Weiner. What's going on here then? Anthony Weiner can't resist playing with his cell phone while he supposed to be canvassing for votes . The candidate's mayoral campaign ran into trouble last week when it was revealed that he had been sexting women for a year after the Twitter scandal which forced him to resign from Congress. It took a turn for the worse on Tuesday when Ms Morgan responded to criticisms of the campaign made by former intern Olivia Nuzzi, calling her a 't***' and a 'c***'. Mr Weiner attended an event organized by the Friends of Rockaway Beach with three other mayoral candidates on Wednesday night as he attempted to get past the controversy. He answered three audience questions before saying, 'God bless you' and walking out of a side door. Outspoken: Communications director Barbara Morgan this week denounced former intern Olivia Nuzzi . Rant: Ms Morgan, pictured with Mr Weiner last week, described Ms Nuzzi as a 'fame-hungry b****' Troubled: Mr Weiner at a campaign event in Queens last night, where he attempted to boost his chances of being elected mayor of New York City . The candidate was chased by 15 reporters - ignoring the event's other speakers - and ran into a waiting SUV. Members of the press shouted out, 'Where's Barbara?', but did not get a response. Also on Wednesday, the would-be mayor ran into more trouble when he was spotted checking his cell phone during a campaign event, serving as an additional reminder of his sexting scandal. The 48-year-old was a popular congressman for Queens for more than 12 years, and had been tipped for higher office before he accidentally tweeted a photograph of his crotch which he had intended to send to a woman who was not his wife. Initial polls in the Democratic primary election for mayor of New York showed Mr Weiner in a strong position against frontrunner Christine Quinn, but his support has collapsed since the revelation that he carried on sexting under the pseudonym 'Carlos Danger'. Apology: Ms Morgan posted this picture on Twitter after she hit the headlines this week . Criticism: Ms Nuzzi, pictured, claimed that Mr Weiner's campaign was badly run and ineffective . Ms Morgan, the campaign's communications director, has not been seen in public since her expletive-laden tirade against Ms Nuzzi was published by Talking Points Memo on Tuesday. Yesterday she took to Twitter to apologize, posting a photograph of a swear jar filled with bills and credit cards. 'Not my best day yesterday,' she wrote. 'Should've known better, been better. Gotta pay up.' In a statement, she said: 'In a moment of frustration, I used inappropriate language in what I thought was an off-the-record conversation. It was wrong and I am very sorry, which is what I said tonight when I called and emailed Olivia to apologize.' Ms Morgan was angry with Ms Nuzzi for posting an article in the New York Daily News suggesting that many of Mr Weiner's staff had only joined his campaign to get close to his wife, Hillary Clinton's adie Huma Abedin. She also claimed that one employee had left because he had only been paid a third of what he was promised, and that the candidate incorrectly referred to her and other interns as 'Monica'.","Fake ads likely posted in Manhattan by staffers of comedy website Funny or Die .

Princess Khaliya, a New York-born blonde, married Prince Hussain, 39, in the fairtytale setting of the Chateau of Chantilly in September 2006. She adopted the name Khaliya upon converting to Islam for her marriage. The couple met when they were both were studying at New York’s Columbia University, from where they graduated with masters degrees. Scroll down for video .

Home, posh, home: Princess Khaliya has bought a Manhattan apartment for $2.2 million in her maiden name . Held at the 14th-century French chateau which was used as a backdrop for the James Bond film A View To A Kill, the lavish ceremony made a five-page spread in Hello! Magazine with the photographs supplied by the groom’s father, racehorse owner the Aga Khan, who is now said to be worth in excess of $9billion. A private ceremony was followed by a ball for family and friends at the Aga Khan’s lavish estate, Aiglemont, in Gouviex, France. This was followed by a civil marriage ceremony. In 2011, the Daily Mail’s Richard Kay reported there was trouble in the marriage and that the couple were parting ways – but neither Prince Hussain nor Princess Khailya ever publicly confirmed the report and it is as yet unknown where the couple actually filed for divorce. However, at a conference earlier this year in Las Vegas to announce the launch of her new foundation, Princess Khaliya was asked about her royal links. Pausing for a moment, she said: ‘I married somebody who is a Prince by honorary decree through the British system because of the aid that they gave to the Indian state during the Battle of Independence…it’s kind of complicated, it’s more of a title that’s connected to a people than to a land. ‘Technically it’s my husband’s domain - my ex-husband’s domain.’  And when asked if she was royal, she replied: ‘I am and I’m not!’ Smiles: Prince Hussain Aga Khan and Kristin White were married in a traditional Muslim ceremony followed by a civil service in France in September 2006 .

Newlyweds: Prince Rahim Aga Khan followed in the footsteps of his brother by marrying an American, model Kendra Spears. The couple tied the knot in Geneva, Switzerland, on August 31 . It is understood that Princess Khaliya lived for a time after the split at 666 Greenwich Street, an apartment building also once home to Monica Lewinsky. However, just weeks ago, she sealed the deal on a sprawling two-bedroom apartment in a modern Condo building on the Lower East Side, featuring gorgeous views overlooking the city, paying $2,240,150 in total. And she has most definitely been seen living the single life after being pictured at trendy Palm Springs musical festival Coachella in April, joining friends British socialite Lady Victoria Hervey and fashion editor Indira Cesarine. The Princess’s father Professor Norman White is an IT specialist, and his wife, Dr Margaret White, is a psychologist - and they live a rather more modest life than the Aga Khan in Montclair, New Jersey. Speaking at Catalyst Week in Las Vegas, Princess Khaliya said: ‘My story is one of listening to your heart and following your intuition and taking paths that are not always the most obvious or the easiest ones - or the most intelligent ones. And I think there’s a lesson to be learned in that.' She discussed her time in the Peace Corps and meeting her ex-husband, which led her to setting up her own foundation, adding: ‘Every time I followed my heart, my intuition and my consciousness led me down another path.’ Her foundation, she said, aims to ‘harness technology in Silicon Valley and use it in the developing world.’ Last photo: Princess Khaliya and Prince Hussain Aga Khan pose for one of the last-known pictures of the couple together at the Alzheimer's Association Rita Hayworth Gala at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, NYC, in October 2008 .

The striking blonde only completed the deal on her new home just weeks before her ex-brother-in law Prince Rahim, 41, married 25-year-old Kendra Spears. The eldest son of Aga Khan IV and one of the 10 richest royals in the world, who is now said to be worth an estimated $800 million, married Seattle-born model Kendra - now rechristened Princess Salwa Aga Khan - on August 31 in a Muslim ceremony at a palace in Geneva, Switzerland. But the couple then celebrated again in lavish style again on Saturday night at Manhattan’s Museum of Natural History. Guests including Naomi Campbell, who introduced the couple at a party, Leonardo DiCaprio, Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis, actors Edward Norton and Rashida Jones toasted the prince and his beautiful bride, Page Six reported. The newlyweds and their guests partied until the early hours under the Central Park West museum’s famous 94-foot-long fiberglass replica of a blue whale. Billionaires Ron Burkle, Vivi Nevo and Prince Vincent of Liechtenstein were said to be in attendance, as well as a host of top models, including Karlie Kloss, who is close friends with the bride.

The 250 guests were treated to performances by British rockers Band of Skulls and American indie band the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, who were seen performing at the bash in a picture posted on Twitter today. Prince Rahim is the heir to the title and fortune of Aga Khan IV, who is the Imam of Shia Ismaili Muslims and is considered a descendant of Prophet Muhammad. Kendra – or Princess Salwa - is a regular on the catwalks of Paris and Milan. She was touted as the “next Cindy Crawford” after launching her career in 2008 and became a face of Escada, Prada, Diane von Furstenberg and other top brands. Prince Hussain’s divorce from Princess Khaliya is just one of a string of marital breakdowns that have blighted the family of the leader of the world’s 12 million Ismaili Muslims.

The Aga Khan has been married twice — his first wife and Rahim and Hussain’s mother is the former English model Sally Croker-Poole. He has been separated from his second wife, Gabriele Thyssen, otherwise known as Begum Inaara, since 2004, but they are still not divorced after a French court quashed a £54million divorce settlement ruling from 2011. The couple, who have a 13-year-old son, Aly, are now expected to face a retrial in around a year's time in what has already been an eight-year legal battle fought in Switzerland, Britain and now France. Meanwhile, the Aga’s daughter, Princess Zahra, 41, wed Dorset farmer’s son and former male model Mark Boyden, but that union ended in 2005 after seven years and two children.

"By . Ben Spencer and Sam Webb . PUBLISHED: . 04:32 EST, 9 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:10 EST, 9 September 2013 . Shocking: The point-blank use of Tasers to stun suspects is being discouraged by senior police as fears over the effects of the weapon grow . Senior police officers are under growing pressure to stop their officers using 50,000-volt Tasers at point-blank range. A review is to be published by the Independent Police Complaints Commission into the use of Tasers in the so-called drive-stun mode. This refers to the use of the stun gun as a close range weapon, where the cartridge is removed and is thrust into an individual’s body in a move designed to inflict pain. Police are being told to dramatically reduce the frequency of such deployments. The directive comes as new figures show the use of Tasers by police in England and Wales has more than doubled to 7,250 deployments a year, raising fresh concern about the risks to the public of more widespread use of the devices. Office for National Statistics numbers, due to be released on Tuesday, will show deployment of the weapons has risen from around 3,500 in 2009 to 14,500 in the two years 2010 and 2011 – 7,250 a year. Deborah Glass, deputy chair of the IPCC, told the Guardian: ‘We have specific concerns about some of the ways and circumstances in which [Taser] is used. ‘We have expressed concerns to Acpo about the use of Taser in the drive-stun method.’ Jules Carey, a lawyer who represents several clients taking action against the police over Taser use, said: ‘There is a real concern around training and judgment. ‘The worry is that Tasers may become the default method of restraint rather than being used as nearly lethal force to prevent serious crime.’ The rise in Taser use comes after the Home Office began rolling out 5,500 new weapons to forces across the country in 2008 after changes allowed the weapons to be used by non-specialist police officers after three days’ training rather than only by specially trained firearms officers.Currently, 11 per cent of police officers – 14,700 – are armed with Tasers. Scroll down for video . The number of officers trained to use Tasers has jumped dramatically in the last few years . The Association of Chief Police Officers said the use of drive-stun is discouraged because it is ineffective, usually used after the officer has missed with the weapon, and often simply enrages the suspect. Simon Chesterman, Acpo's spokesman on . armed police, said there were ‘valid concerns’ about the use of Tasers . in the drive-stun move - but questioned the figures. He . said the rise in deployments corresponded to the increase in weapons . being rolled out across the country, and did not represent Tasers being . used more often. Taser use in the figures covers drawing the weapon but not firing, aiming the weapon and engaging the red light on the suspect, using in the drive stun mode and firing the Taser – which happens in only around 25 per cent of cases, according to Acpo. Mr Chesterman said: ‘These figures show the use of Taser has increased in line with the rollout of more weapons. ‘There will be concerns raised by individuals that don’t necessarily understand the underlying causes of the increase and there will be people raising concerns over this who don’t agree with the police having Tasers. ‘I would argue that there are more valid concerns around drive-stun and around Taser use on vulnerable people than on these figures.’ Jules Carey is a lawyer representing a number of clients taking action against the police over Taser use. He . said: 'They are being used as a convenience to assist with restraint, . rather than disarming someone who may have a lethal weapon themselves.' Police are also under pressure over Taser deployments against vulnerable individuals. In . April, 32-year-old Andrew Pimlott – who had doused himself in petrol . and was threatening to kill himself – died in a fireball after police . fired a Taser at him outside his home in Plymouth, Devon. In 2011 a 12-year-old girl was shot by police with a 50,000-volt Taser. The . girl, who was brandishing two knives and threatening to harm herself, . was one of more than 20 children shot by officers using the electric . stun guns, figures show. In . July Jordan Begley, 23, of Gorton, Manchester is suspected to have had a . fatal heart attack after being hit by the 50,000 volt charge by a police officer. A police enquiry is under way into the death, after it emerged that Mr Begley may have been mistaken for a wanted man with the same name . Officers were called to the ice cream factory worker’s home by his mother Dot to deal with a row between him and a neighbour. She . claimed her son was unarmed and ‘calm and compliant’ before he was . shot, which left him ‘battered and bruised’ and with ‘his eyes . flickering’. There have been seven taser-related deaths in the UK since 2004, all believed to be from the conventional use of the weapon . Six weeks before the incident he had collapsed from an irregular heartbeat and was undergoing tests to diagnose a suspected heart condition when he died. On nine occasions, youths were subjected to the drive-stun technique. Police . said the Taser was used to  detain the girl and ‘prevent serious harm . to both her, the public and the officers’ after she began behaving . ‘aggressively’ in St Helens, Merseyside, in July 2011. The . schoolgirl was one of  more than 20 children stunned with the weapons . in the past three years,  according to figures obtained under the . Freedom of Information Act. They included six children aged 14, four aged 15 and 13 aged 16. Police officers have also shot 75 dogs, two cows and a sheep with Tasers stun-guns since 2010. Last week, the Crown Prosecution . Service said it was not laying charges against an officer who deployed a . Taser against blind man Colin Farmer, 63. The police officer mistook his white stick for a samurai sword. The blunder happened on October 12 last year after reports were received of a man walking through the town centre in Chorley, Lancashire, with a martial arts weapon. Mr Farmer, who has suffered two strokes and walks at a 'snail’s pace', was on his way to a pub to meet friends for a drink and did not realise anything was wrong until the officer Tasered him. The grandfather, who is now pursuing legal action against Lancashire Constabulary, was taken to hospital before being released. Police later arrested a 27-year old man believed to be the real offender but he was released without charge after no weapon was found. Mr Farmer, who has five sons and two grandchildren, said: ‘This officer displayed that his judgement was clouded because he clearly can’t tell the difference between a disabled old man and a criminal. ‘I am devastated that the CPS have made this decision because I am now worried about the safety of others as this trigger-happy officer continues to patrols our streets. He added: ‘I was slowly making my way down the street when I heard this man shouting. I had no idea it was directed at me and I thought I was being mugged. ‘But suddenly I felt a huge force on my back and this electric shock went right through my body and I collapsed in a heap on the floor. I was shouting all the time, “I’m blind! I’m blind!” 'After Mr Farmer fell to the floor face down, the police officer knelt on his back before handcuffing him. Mr Farmer said: ‘By this stage he could clearly see that I was disabled and my walking stick was in full view but he couldn’t wait to force his knee into my back and hurt me.' The officer now faces a gross misconduct hearing.","Taser use has jumped - more than 10 per cent of officers now carry one .

"By . James Rush and Hannah Roberts In Rome . PUBLISHED: . 05:20 EST, 31 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:59 EST, 31 March 2013 . The Archbishop of Canterbury warned yesterday against ‘pinning hopes on individuals’ at the top to solve our problems. The Most Rev Justin Welby said that ignoring complexity and human weaknesses left us  ‘unreasonably disappointed’ with everyone ‘from politicians to NHS, education to environment’. Ten days after being enthroned as head of the Church of England, he warned against what he called the ‘hero leader culture’. Sermon: The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, used his first Easter Sunday sermon to warn against 'pinning hopes on individuals' Cathedral: The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby addresses the congregation at Canterbury Cathedral during the Easter Day service .

Sermon: The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most . Reverend Justin Welby (left), delivers his sermon during the Easter Day . service (right) He told worshippers at Canterbury Cathedral: ‘A political party gets a new leader and three months later there is comment about disappointment. ‘An economy suffers the worst blow in generations with a debt crisis and economic downturn, and the fact that not everything is perfect within five years is seen as total failure.’ Turning to reports on Friday that only 40 per cent of churchgoers are convinced the new archbishop can resolve the problems of the Church of England, he said: ‘I do hope that means the other 60 per cent thought the idea so barking mad that they did not answer the question.’ Mr Welby said: ‘Put not your trust in new leaders, better systems, new organisations or regulatory reorganisation. ‘They may well be good and necessary, but will to some degree fail. Complexities: The Most Rev Justin Welby said ignoring complexity and humanity left us 'unreasonably disappointed' with everyone 'from politicians to NHS, education to environment' 'Cruelty': Mr Welby told worshippers at . Canterbury Cathedral that setting people or institutions up to heights . where they can only fail was 'mere cruelty'. After the service: The Archbishop of Canterbury (centre) speaks with the Very Reverend Robert Willis (right), Dean of Canterbury, outside Canterbury Cathedral following the Easter Sunday service . ‘Human sin means pinning  hopes on individuals is always a mistake, and assuming that any organisation is able to have such good systems that human failure will be eliminated is naive.’ He added: ‘Human fallibility recognised, God’s sovereignty trusted – these are also the only stable foundation for human beings in society. ‘Setting people or institutions up to heights where they cannot but fail is mere cruelty.’ The 57-year-old former oil executive added: ‘Holy Week and Easter show us the reality of God and of human beings. ‘It is a reality that equips us for action in the world, action that is based on hope and realism, not on cynicism or fear.’ Warning: The Archbishop used his first Easter Sunday sermon to warn against 'pinning hopes in individuals' in politics and public life . At the Vatican newly-elected Pope Francis was also giving his first Easter Sunday address since becoming the leader of the Catholic church. His unwillingness to embrace Vatican pomp has already earned him a reputation as an ‘austerity’ Pope and the new pontiff used his address to preach what he practises – with an attack on greed and selfishness. Pope Francis’s greeting from the balcony of St Peter’s Basilica reflected his push for social justice. He lamented the ‘world still divided by greed looking for easy gain, wounded by the selfishness that threatens human life and the family’.

'Guardians of creation': The former Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina condemned the 'iniquitous exploitation of natural resources' and urged everyone to be 'guardians' of creation . Message: Francis said the message of Easter is that faith can help people transform their lives by letting 'those desert places in our hearts bloom' During his address, Francis said he . wished a ‘happy Easter’ greeting could reach every ‘home and family, . especially where the suffering is greatest in hospitals and prisons’. The Pope also decried terrorism and what he called the 21st century’s most extensive form of slavery – human trafficking. Since the start of his Papacy a fortnight ago Francis has eschewed Vatican grandeur. He has refused to move into the . luxurious Papal apartments, which he claimed were ‘big enough for 300 . people’, and continues to wear a plastic wristwatch, plain iron crucifix . and scruffy black shoes. As Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis lived in a simple one-bedroom flat and travelled by public transport.

Cristina Kirchner has asked him to intervene. But, like previous Popes, he urged . Israelis and Palestinians to resume peace talks and expressed regret for . a series of conflicts including Syria, the Congo and North Korea. The address followed a mass  celebrated on the steps of the great basilica, where around 250,000 pilgrims were gathered. Afterwards, flanked by heavy . security, Francis asked to tour the square by popemobile, so he could . embrace children and the sick. In a typically down-to-earth gesture, he even gave a thumbs-up to someone in the crowd. He also greeted around 30 cardinals who attended.

Bentley today announced more than 1,000 new jobs as part of a major £800million investment boost for the UK that will see a new £150,000 luxury 4X4 built in Britain rather than rival Bratislava. Prime Minister David Cameron was on hand at the Bentley factory in Crewe for the announcement which he hailed as ‘fantastic news’, a vote of confidence in Britain and another welcome sign of a healing UK economy. The new jobs and cash boost means Bentley will now build up to 4,000 a year of its first ever sports utility vehicle (SUV) at its factory in Crewe. It becomes the fourth model to roll off the line. It also marks a major boost for the existing 4,000-strong British work-force. Height of luxury: The new Bentley comes with its own built-in picnic set - complete with champagne glasses . The car's the star: The stunning four-wheel drive Bentley has a classic look . Big business: The Bentley's first ever sports utility vehicle (SUV) will be built in Britain - bringing an £800million investment boost to the UK and more than 1,000 new jobs . Bentley, which is owned by Germany’s Volkswagen group, had been considering manufacturing the £150,000 4X4 in the Slovakian capital of Bratislava in Eastern Europe. The new 6.0-litre 185mph Bentley sports utility vehicle which accelerates from rest to 60mph in under four seconds is set to go on sale from 2016. It will be a central plank in plans to double the luxury car-makes sales to 15,000 by 2018 - accounting for between a quarter and a third of all global sales. Sales were already up 22 per cent last year to 8,510. Bentley said: ‘Over the next three years Bentley will invest more than £800 million in its headquarters at Crewe and the development of new models. It will create over 1000 jobs in the UK.’ Prime Minister David Cameron who was at the Bentley factory for the announcement said: ‘This £800 million investment and a thousand new jobs from Bentley is fantastic news for both Crewe and for the UK as a whole. It is another important milestone in strengthening our economy. Powerful: The 6.0-litre Bentley SUV, which will go on sale from 2016, can reached speeds of up to 185mph . ‘One sector that we know is sprinting ahead in the global race is our booming automotive industry. One vehicle rolls off a production line somewhere in the UK every 20 seconds and we have just launched the Government’s Automotive Industrial Strategy to help continue this success for years to come.’ Mr Cameron added: ‘I am delighted that Bentley will be building their new vehicle here, not only creating a thousand jobs, but safeguarding many more, as well as increasing training opportunities for highly skilled apprentices.’ Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ‘This is a welcome commitment to the UK from a major international car maker. Our automotive industrial strategy proves this government’s commitment to working with world-class companies like Bentley to create jobs and promote exports. ‘Bentley was the first firm I visited as a government minister and serves as a real example of high value manufacturing. They export more than four out of every five cars they make in the UK to the rest of the world.’ A Bentley spokesman said: ’The sports utility vehicle  be a thoroughbred Bentley true to the brand hallmarks of luxury, performance, quality and craftsmanship. The styling will set it apart from any other SUV on the road and will be true to the Bentley design DNA. Prime Minister joins the Bentley Boys: (Left to right) Bentley chairman and chief executive Dr Wolfgang Schreiber, Prime Minister David Cameron, apprentice engineer James Bate, and chairman of the board of the Volkswagen Group Dr. Martin Winterkorn. ‘It will be the most luxurious and . most powerful SUV in the market. The response from customers to a . Bentley SUV has been extremely positive in the last 16 months.’ The . long-awaited decision in Britain’s favour  means the plate that has . adorned generations for Bentleys: ‘Made in Crewe, England’ will continue . to resonate. Cheaper . labour rates  in Slovakia and uncertainty over whether Britain will . remain in he European Union if there is a referendum were counting . against the British case. But craftsmanship, a motivated’ British . workforce, and the logistical cost of transporting parts between Britain . and Slovakia were in its favour. There is plenty of room to build the new Bentley at Crewe and capacity was not an issue. However, it is understood that Crewe is also in line for subsidies worth up to £7million in tied to training and more jobs being created. Production line: British Prime Minister David Cameron is shown around the Bentley factory in Crewe, Cheshire, by Chairman of the Board of Volkswagen Group Dr Martin Winterkorn, pictured second left . Had the decision gone the other way it . would have been  the first volume -produced Bentley  to be built outside . of the UK in its near 100 year history since  it was founded in 1919. It would have been built alongside other cars belonging to the . Volkswagen  Group such as the Porsche Cayenne, Audi Q7 and Volkswagen . Touareg. Bentley did build some Flying Spur models in the Eastern German city of Dresden  during 2005 and 2006 because of a shortage of capacity at Crewe. But series production of a major model would have been a bitter blow to traditionalists. Final styling of the new car has already been signed off and, following a significant facelift, will be very different from that shown on a much criticised ‘concept’ version which appeared at last year’s Geneva Motor Show.  Bosses admitted afterwards there  had been ‘room for improvement’ . The new model is expected to share the ‘face’ of the more familiar Bentley Continental. Potential buyers have already placed more than 2,000 pre-orders even before the final showroom styling of the car has been revealed. Bentley has decided to keep the production of its new SUV at its production factory in Crewe, Cheshire . The new Bentley 4X4 will begin in price and prestige where the new rival Range Rover leaves off. About half of all sales will come from the United States and China followed by the Middle East, Russia and Europe. Some 87.3 per cent of Bentley’s cars are already exported. Booming Bentley has been a huge success story for Volkswagen. Operating profit is up from £6.85million to £86million, with turnover up 29.9 per cent to £1.2billion. It expects ‘double digit’ growth in 2013. Founded by Walter Owen ‘W.O’ Bentley 94 years ago, Bentley was  bought in 1998  by Germany’s  Volkswagen Group from Vickers PLC as part of a complicated three-way £430million deal in which their German rivals BMW took control of Rolls-Royce. The car industry in Britain has been enjoying a renaissance with massive investment and buoyant sales and profits by the likes of Jaguar Land Rover. Popular: There have already been 2,000 pre-orders even before the final showroom styling of the car had been revealed . It represents about 3 per cent of annual GDP, with a typical turnover of £55bn, and employs 700,000 people.  Statistics from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, show a car, van, bus or truck rolls off a production line in the UK every 20 seconds. And four out of five of these vehicles are then exported. Earlier this month Jaguar Land Rover which employs 25,000 posted stellar results for the first half of 2013, with sales up 14 per cent on the same period last year. It shipped 210,190 vehicles to some 178 markets around the world. And the industry as a whole was this month given a £1billion shot in the arm to help develop the ‘vehicle of the future’. The Government and the automotive industry will invest £500million each over the next decade in a national engine development centre which is expected to create at least 30,000 jobs. Business Secretary Vince Cable said the Advanced Propulsion Centre will open next year to research, develop and commercialise the technologies for the vehicles of the future.","Bentley had been considering moving production of the £150,000 luxury 4X4s to the Slovakian capital of Bratislava in Eastern Europe .

Police are to be investigated over claims that a man who died after being shot with a Taser was mistaken for a wanted criminal with the same name. Jordan Begley, 23, who had a suspected heart defect, was hit with a charge from the 50,000-volt stun gun after officers were called to deal with a row at his home last month. Yesterday it emerged that the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is looking into claims of a tragic mix-up. Jordan Begley, pictured at his workplace, was tasered by greater Manchester Police officers and later died in hospital . Namesake: Jordan Begley, who was wanted by the police at the time . The watchdog said mistaken identity . was one line of inquiry, but said Mr Begley’s family had not made the . claim to investigators. ‘We . will look at all relevant information, including call handling and . radio transmissions between officers responding to Mr Begley’s address . to see if any mistake occurred, and if it did, if that mistake had any . inappropriate influence on any officer’s decisions to use force,’ said . an IPCC spokesman. Police also insist there is no evidence to support the claim and say they were initially told that Mr Begley had a knife. Officers . were called to the ice cream factory worker’s home in Gorton, . Manchester, by his mother Dot on July 10 to deal with a row between him . and a neighbour. Loss: A picture of a five-year-old Mr Begley with his younger brother Jake, now 17 .

Minutes . after officers from Greater Manchester Police arrived, Mr Begley was . shot using a Taser and died less than two hours later. Grief and anger: Dot Begley wants answers about the day her son died . Mrs . Begley, a 46-year-old café worker, said yesterday that officers had . repeatedly asked if she was from Sale – the nearby home town of a . 25-year-old wanted burglar who had the same name as her son and who had . breached the terms of his prison licence. ‘It didn’t make sense at the time but then when I found out about the other Jordan Begley it clicked,’ she said. She . claimed her son was unarmed and ‘calm and compliant’ before he was . shot, which left him ‘battered and bruised’ and with ‘his eyes . flickering’. ‘The . response was so heavy-handed – Jordan was nine stone and they’d been . called out to deal with a domestic argument,’ she added. ‘He . was calm and compliant, he wasn’t armed and they could have cuffed him . if they wanted to. I can’t believe they’ve followed protocol and there’s . no way that Taser should ever have been used.’ Mr Begley is the tenth person to die after being shot with a Taser since they were introduced in 2004. Six . weeks before the incident he had collapsed from an irregular heartbeat . and was undergoing tests to diagnose a suspected heart condition when he . died. A Home Office . post-mortem examination has so far failed to establish Mr Begley’s cause . of death, but independent tests carried out on behalf of the family . found he had marks that suggest he had been handcuffed. The family have . also launched a civil claim against police over his death. Assistant . Chief Constable Dawn Copley confirmed the mistaken identity claims but . said she was ‘not aware’ of any evidence to support it. ‘We will of course continue to work with the IPCC to assist their investigation,’ she added. The other Jordan Begley was eventually rearrested by police a week after the Taser incident and returned to prison. Beard Street in Manchester, where the incident took place . Mrs Begley was stunned when armed officers arrived at her house and stormed inside the small terraced property.She says she was forced to wait outside her home as around 10 officers spoke to her son inside. For the first time she has spoken publicly about the night she says left her life ‘in ruins’. She said: 'Not long after he got back from work there was an argument with a neighbour but it was something or nothing. Jordan had been threatened and he wanted to go back outside and sort it out but I locked the door and phoned the police. 'Two officers arrived at first and everything was very calm, they were on the doorstep chatting but then loads of vans turned up with armed officers and they forced him inside. He was calm and compliant and doing everything they told him and for that reason I thought everything was going to be okay. 'I was outside looking in through the front door and I could see they had a Taser pointed at him, he had his arms by his side and was still following instructions. 'One of the officers kept saying ""step back, step back"" but he was against the dining room table and couldn’t step back any further. At that point one of the officers closed the front door on me.' The first time Mrs Begley realised Jordan had been Tasered was when an ambulance arrived at the house and he was carried out on a stretcher. She described her son as ‘battered and bruised’ and with ‘his eyes flickering’.","Jordan Begley, 23, died after he was Tasered by police in Manchester .

In a dramatic change in drug policy, the Obama administration said on Thursday that it won't sue to stop the states of Colorado and Washington from allowing recreational marijuana use as it issued a sweeping national policy statement that outlines its top priorities for pot enforcement. The action, welcomed by supporters of legalization, could set the stage for more states to legalize marijuana. Alaska is scheduled to vote on legalizing recreational use of marijuana next year, and a few other states plan similar votes in 2016. Under the policy, the top investigative priorities range from preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors to preventing sales revenue from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels and preventing the diversion of marijuana outside of states where it is legal under state law. No Longer Under Threat: Cody Park exhales a cloud of marijuana smoke after taking a hit on a bong at the first day of Hempfest, Friday, Aug. 16, 2013, in Seattle . Other top-priority enforcement areas include stopping state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover for trafficking other illegal drugs and preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana. The top areas also include preventing drugged driving, preventing growing marijuana on public land and preventing marijuana possession on federal property. The announcement follows last year's first-in-the-nation legalization of recreational marijuana use by the states of Colorado and Washington. In the aftermath of the moves by the two state, Attorney General Eric Holder launched a review of marijuana enforcement policy that included an examination of Colorado and Washington. The issue was whether the states should be blocked from operating marijuana markets on the grounds that actively regulating an illegal substance conflicts with federal drug law that bans it. Nearly a year after Washington state and Colorado voted to legalize . recreational marijuana, the Obama administration announced on Thursday . that it won't sue the states to comply with federal laws . Hempfest: Last December, President Barack Obama said it does not make sense for the federal government to go after recreational drug users in Washington and Colorado . The Obama administration also issued new guidelines for all U.S. attorneys on the dynamic issue of marijuana law . Last December, President Barack Obama said it does not make sense for the federal government to go after recreational drug users in a state that has legalized recreational use of small amounts of marijuana. Last week, the White House said that prosecution of drug traffickers remains an important priority. A Pew Research Center poll in March found that 60 percent of Americans think the federal government shouldn't enforce federal anti-marijuana laws in states where its use has been approved. Younger people, who tend to vote more Democratic, are especially prone to that view. But opponents are worried these moves will lead to more use by young people.

Kevin Sabet, the director of Project Smart Approaches to Marijuana, an anti-legalization group, predicted the new Justice Department policy will accelerate a national discussion about legalization because people will see its harms — including more drugged driving and higher high school dropout rates.","Last December, President Barack Obama said it does not make sense for the federal government to go after recreational drug users in Colorado and Washington State ."

A Cambridge graduate has decided to follow her dream of becoming a mermaid after recovering from an extremely rare brain tumour. Mairead Kelly, 25, has been training as an accountant for the last three years but when she’s not in the office, she is working as a professional mermaid. Ms Kelly, from Cambridge, said: ‘I chose to do it as I love swimming and I have been wanting to get into performing for quite a while. This seemed like the perfect opportunity - it’s something different and quite unusual. Mairead Kelly, 25, was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2010. She has had two operations and is now fully recovered. After her treatment, she decided to pursue her dream of becoming a real-life mermaid . ‘I was pretty tentative the first time I got in the water because after two surgeries my nose and sinuses will never be the same, and I wasn’t sure how they’d react to the pressure of being underwater but it’s given me no problems.’ Ms Kelly was diagnosed with a rare benign tumour of the pituitary gland, known as thyrotropinoma, as she finished her final year of university in 2010. She had surgery in 2011 to remove the tumour but it started to grow back so she had to have a second operation in January this year, she has now made a full recovery. She explained: ‘I had lots of health issues when I was at university. I was really tired, my hair was falling out and I bruised really easily. ‘I did swimming because it was one of the only forms of exercise I could do. It has been really helpful in my recovery. ‘I’m stronger than I have been in years. I love swimming. Swimming underwater is very zen, the rest of the world is blocked out and everything is just calm and peaceful. Ms Kelly was diagnosed after she became very tired and noticed that her hair was falling out. She also found that her skin was bruising very easily. She was found to have a pituitary gland tumour . Ms Kelly (pictured recovering from surgery in hospital) says she was worried that her nose and sinuses would struggle with the increased pressure under water because of the surgery . Ms Kelly said: 'I definitely don't think my degree has been put to waste. People may perceive accountancy as a more worthwhile career to pursue after graduation, but I feel that both of my careers are valuable' ‘The motivation of wanting to perfect swimming in a tail and monofin in order to start performing underwater was also really important in helping me regain my strength.’ Ms Kelly has teamed-up with Frankie Dubery, a fellow Cambridge graduate, and friend Demelza Hillier, 25, and together they take to the water as a pod of mermaids. They train for up to ten hours a week in freezing lakes before dazzling crowds with their skills as they swim and sing at events across the country, including parties and black tie balls. Ms Kelly said: 'I'm stronger than I have been in years. I love swimming. Swimming underwater is very zen, the rest of the world is blocked out and everything is just calm and peaceful' When Ms Kelly is not performing as a mermaid, she works as an accountant. She says that both jobs are fulfilling in their own way . Ms Kelly (pictured as a mermaid on Brighton beach) believes that swimming has helped her to regain her strength after her illness . The trio have even been asked to perform for crowds as far afield as Australia and Ibiza. Known as Merlesque, they have been making a splash since the start of the year in their £3,000 silicon costumes complete with fins and scales. Ms Dubery, 24, said: ‘Sometimes people don’t believe me when I say I am a mermaid. Different people have different reactions. ‘It is quite interesting how different people’s reactions are - mostly people are really fascinated.’ Ms Kelly (right) set up a group called Merlesque with her friends Demelza Hillier (left) and Frankie Dubery (centre).

She said: ‘I definitely don’t think my degree has been put to waste. ‘People may perceive accountancy as a more worthwhile career to pursue after graduation, but I feel that both of my careers are valuable in different ways. ‘The majority of people don’t directly use their degrees in their future professional life - they use the transferable skills you develop through completing a degree.’ A thyrotropinoma is a pituitary tumour that secretes a hormone called thyroid-stimulating hormone. An excess of this hormone caused hyperthyroidism which can be serious. Thyrotropinomas are very rare - they represent just one or two per cent of all benign pituitary tumours. Symptoms include irritability, nervousness, sweating, tremors, difficulty sleeping, weight loss, brittle hair and thinning of the skin. Treatment options include surgery to remove the tumour, radiation therapy and medication.","Mairead Kelly, 25, was diagnosed with a pituitary gland tumour in 2010 .

Scientists around the world are working to resurrect extinct animals from the long-lost woolly mammoth to an Australian frog that gives birth to its young via its mouth. Researchers in Australia have made the first steps towards bringing the frog, which was certified extinct in 1983, back to life, but the Lazarus Project - a 'de-extinction initiative' - is hopeful that many other species can be re-introduced to be studied by scientists. The process of de-extinction is more complex than cloning living animals, but a group of scientists believe humans have the ability and obligation to repair the damage they have done to the planet, which has led to countless types of animals dying out. An effort is underway in Australia to resurrect the southern gastric-brooding frog (pictured), which swallowed fertilised eggs and gave birth orally, before the last known female died in captivity in 1983. Scientists had been fascinated by the creatures but before they could study them in detail, the frogs died out . Stem cell scientist Sir Ian Wilmut who is best known for cloning the world's first mammal, Dolly the sheep, thinks modern techniques could be used to create a replica of the prehistoric animal. Sir Ian said told The Guardian: 'I've always been very sceptical about the whole idea, but it dawned on me that if you could clear the first hurdle of getting viable cells from mammoths, you might be able to do something useful and interesting.' 'I think it should be done as long as we can provide great care for the animal. If there are reasonable prospects of them being healthy, we should do it. We can learn a lot about them.' Samples from 'Yuka' the mammoth who lived 39,000-years-ago have been sent to laboratories in South Korea and Russian researchers hope to clone her. The source of viable mammoth cells could come from  a number of frozen bodies discovered in the Siberian permafrost in recent years. However, Sir Ian is not terribly optimistic about the scientist's chances at present as there are many technical challenges to overcome. An effort is underway in Australia to resurrect the southern gastric-brooding frog, which swallowed fertilised eggs and gave birth orally, before the last known female died in captivity in 1983. Scientists had been fascinated by the creatures, which seemed to disappear from the forests of Queensland every year and were thought to be hibernating, but before they could study them in detail, the frogs died out, M.R. O'Connor said in an article for Salon.com. Luckily,samples of the frogs had been frozen and scientists are now using a cloning technique called somatic cell nuclear transfer to try and resurrect them. Researchers at the University of New South Wales removed the nuclei from eggs of a closely related living frog species and replaced it with the extinct species' cells and in spring the eggs reached the early embryonic stage. Mike Archer, a professor of paleobiology and a member of the Lazarus Project, told the publication: 'We are watching Lazarus arise from the . dead, step by exciting step. We’ve reactivated dead cells into living . ones and revived the extinct frog’s genome in the process.' It is not just Australian scientists who are pinning their hopes on de-extinction techniques. Four years ago researchers in Spain managed to produce a baby Pyrenean Ibex (like the one pictured) - extinct since 2000 - born of a domestic goat, but unfortunately the animal died soon after birth .

Four years ago researchers in Spain managed to produce a baby Pyrenean Ibex born of a domestic goat but unfortunately the animal died soon after birth. The species has been extinct since 2000. Scientists at the University of California are sequencing the genome of the passenger pigeon, which died out in 1914, with other groups setting their sites on doing similar work on the extinct Californian monk seal, Carolina parakeet and Tasmanian tiger. But perhaps the Sooam Biotech Research Foundation in Korea has embarked on the ambitious and high profile de-extinction project as it is working to reintroduce the woolly mammoth. However, opinion is divided as to whether such science is responsible. Scientists in favour of the practice believe it could un-do human wrongs against the planet.

Environmentalist Stuart Brand believes humans have the ability and the moral obligation, to repair any damage they have caused to the planet . Environmentalist Stuart Brand, who is co-founder of the Revive and Restore Foundation (another de-extinction project) told Salon: 'Humans have made a huge hole in nature, we have the ability, maybe the moral obligation, to repair that damage.' However, other scientists think advances in the field could actually damage current conservation efforts and could potentially make more animals extinct. A number of researchers attending a summit at Stanford University to debate the ethics of de-extinction were reportedly concerned the ability to litterally put extinct species on ice, could become standard pracitice instead of trying to protect current animals at risk of extinction living in the wild. Jamie Rappaport Clark, president and CEO of Defenders of Wildlife, reportedly said that she believes politicians would take advantage of de-extinction technology to undermine species conservation. Professor Ronald Sandler from Northwestern University said de-extinction is not guaranteed to preserve a species or solve the problem of its habitat being damaged by humans. He warned that the southern gastric-brooding frog could be resurrected and reintroduced only to find that the forest streams it needs to stay alive, have run dry.

Scientists believe they have finally solved the mystery of how the skeletons of more than 200 people came to be in a frozen lake in northern India. The skeletons, which were first discovered by a British forest guard in 1942, were initially thought to be the bodies of Japanese soldiers travelling through India as part of a World War II land invasion. But although the cold climate around the Lake of Roopkund, at 16,000ft above sea level, had preserved some of the hair, flesh and leather clothes of the victims, the bodies were dated to around 850AD. Scroll down for video . The mystery of how dozens of skeletons ended up on the shores of the Lake of Roopkund has puzzled locals and scientists for centuries . Scientists discovered they appeared to be from two main groups - one was closely related which seemed to be a family group and another of shorter local people. They concluded that the family were likely to be pilgrims heading through the valley with the help of the locals as guides. Theories ranging from a landslide to a mass suicide were put forward to explain the deaths, but it is only now that researchers believe they know what caused the cracks in their skulls. During World War II the British government feared they were the remains of Japanese soldiers, but tested showed they were much older . Now scientists believe a sudden freak hailstorm is to blame for the cracked skulls of the dead . The skeletons remain littered around the lake's edge . The Lake of Roopkund is in northern India near Nepal . A 2004 expedition to the site concluded the group was killed by cricket ball-sized hailstones during a sudden storm.

French scientists have solved the . mystery of how one of the world’s smallest frogs can croak and hear . other amphibians without possessing an eardrum. Gardiner’s . frogs from the Seychelles islands, which are just one centimetre long, . were thought to be deaf, but the research revealed they actually hear . sounds through their mouths. Using X-rays, the scientists discovered the frogs’ mouths act as a resonator . or amplifier for the frequencies ‘spoken’ by the species. Gardiner's frogs (pictured) from the Seychelles islands, which are just one centimetre long, were thought to be deaf, but the research revealed they actually hear sounds through their mouths . The mouth acts as a resonator, or amplifier for the frequencies emitted by Gardiner's frogs . The transmission of the . sound from the oral cavity to the inner ear has been optimised by two . evolutionary adaptations: a reduced thickness of the tissue between the . mouth and the inner ear and a smaller number of tissue layers between . the mouth and the inner ear. Dr Boistel . said: 'The combination of a mouth cavity and bone conduction allows . Gardiner’s frogs to perceive sound effectively without use of a tympanic . middle ear' The species of frog is one of the smallest in the world and does not possess a middle ear with an eardrum. Scientists have been puzzled as to how the frogs are able to use sound to communicate but have found the amphibians use their mouth cavity and tissue to transmit sound to their inner ears. The team, led by Renaud Boistel from CNRS and the University of Poitiers as well as scientists from a number of other French institutions and the Nature Protection trust of Seychelles, published the findings in PNAS. The way sound is heard is common to many lineages of animals and appeared during the Triassic age, some 200-250 million years ago. Although the auditory systems of the . four-legged animals have evolved, they have in . common the middle ear with eardrum and ossicles, which emerged . independently in the major lineages. The skin of the animal reflects 99.9 per cent of an incoming sound wave hiting the body close to the inner ear. Without a middle ear, sound waves cannot be transported to the inner ear but the mouth acts as a resonating cavity for the frequencies of the frogs' song, amplifying the sound in the mouth. The body tissue between the buccal cavity and the inner ear is adapted to transport these sound waves to the inner ear . However, frogs  do not possess an outer ear like humans but a middle ear with an eardrum located directly on the surface of the head. Incoming sound waves make the eardrum vibrate, and the eardrum delivers these vibrations using the ossicles to the inner ear where hair cells translate them into electric signals sent to the brain. However, Gardiner's frogs do not have a . middle ear and many people doubted that it was possible for the species . to detect sound in the brain as a consequence, as almost all of a sound . wave reaching an animal is reflected at the surface of its skin. Dr Boistel said: 'These small animals, Gardiner’s frogs, . have been living isolated in the rainforest of the Seychelles for 47 to . 65 million years, since these islands split away from the main . continent. A 3D reconstruction of a frog's head with a slice through the eye showing the ouside of the inner ear. X-ray imaging on different species showed that the transmission of the sound from the oral cavity to the inner ear has been optimised by two evolutionary adaptation . 'If they can hear, their auditory system must be a survivor of . life forms on the ancient supercontinent Gondwana.' In order to test if the frogs really do use sound to communicate, the scientists set up loudspeakers in their natural habitat and broadcast pre-recorded frog songs. This caused males present in the rainforest to answer, proving that they were able to hear the sound from the loudspeakers. Here you can see the reduced thickness of the tissue between the mouth and the inner ear and a smaller number of tissue layers between the mouth and the inner ear. Dr Boistel said:'The combination of a mouth cavity and bone conduction allows Gardiner's frogs to perceive sound effectively without a middle ear . Scientists had proposed the frogs might use an extra-tympanic pathway through the lungs or bone conduction. Peter Cloetens, a scientist at the ESRF who took part in the study, said whether body tissue will transport sound or not depends on its biomechanical properties. He used X-ray imaging techniques to establish neither the the pulmonary system nor the muscles of these frogs contribute significantly to the transmission of sound to the inner ears. Numerical simulations helped to investigate whether the sound was received through the frog’s heads.

'Freediving 'The Pit' was a surreal and magical experience, the cathedral light dramatically pierced the cool dark waters and provided an ethereal backlight to the beckoning caves and caverns below,' they said. The depth of these pits are often unknown due to the swirling white halocline that hovers at 30 metres, a chemical reaction between layers of fresh and salt water, through which the sunlight barely pierces and the dark depths lie beneath. The deepest cenote that they freedived was 75 metres in vertical depth called La Laguna, beneath the halocline they were freediving in pitch black with only glow sticks on their dive rope to guide them. 'We only discovered the bottom of La Laguna at 75 metres when our feet touched the silty bottom. Freediving La Laguna was a very eerie and dark experience!' Inquisitive: While most divers remain a few feet from the surface, Eusebio and Christian can sink to the seabed and experience the joys of inquisitive wildlife . The Cozumel wreck, off Mexico's coast: Being able to freedive to such depths gives a whole new element of fun and freedom when exploring shipwrecks together . When they explored the Cozumel Wreck, also known as Felipe Xicoténcatl C-53, located off the island of Cozumel off the Mexican coast, they had fun with their pictures. The wreck lies on the sandy bottom of depths between 25 to 30 metres. The Felipe Xicoténcatl was a U.S. made Admirable-Class minesweeper built in 1944 for the Navy during World War II. In 1962 the Wreck was sold to the Mexican Navy and was retitled ARM General Felipe Xicoténcatl (C53) where it guarded the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea aiding search and rescue operations and watching for illegal arms and drug trafficking. It was sunk deliberately in 1999 for the purpose of recreational diving and as an artificial reef for marine life and corals. The incredible  dolphin shots, as well as the inquisitive seal and tutrle were all taken while on a sailing and freediving trip to Hawaii. Mutual love: The couple travel the world together for six months of the year exploring new hidden worlds under the waves . They were along the Kona coast of the island and woke early each morning to freedive with a pod of wild Hawaiian Spinner Dolphins who would return to the bay for play and rest after a night fishing in the deep oceans. The pod was over 60 strong and very curious. 'The dolphins would approach and play with us for many hours during the morning of their own free will and could leave at anytime if they wish. 'Freediving with wild dolphins is exhilerating and enchanting, their intense curiosity and intelligence is captivating and their movement in the water skilful and elegant.'","Married couple Eusebio and Christina Saenz de Santamaria, share their love of freediving and regularly dive to depths of 80metres or more .

A violent thug who beat his puppy with a piece of wood has been jailed after horrified neighbours filmed the attack on their phones. Jason Appleby, 38, was filmed hitting and jabbing six-month-old dog Bonnie with a piece of wood, and kicking a children’s playhouse as the terrified dog hid inside.

Inspector . Hannah Bryer said: 'The video footage of this incident speaks for . itself. 'Appleby’s conduct towards his dog can only be described as . disgraceful and vile act of deliberate cruelty.

Terry said: 'I have never known a dog so nervous in all my life as she was when I first got her. It was heartbreaking to see.

"By . Martha De Lacey . PUBLISHED: . 08:19 EST, 6 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:47 EST, 6 August 2013 . When South African playwright Yael Farber read about the fatal gang-rape of a young female student on a Delhi bus in 2012, she was left profoundly disturbed - both as a person and a mother, but also as an artist. She felt a responsibility towards the victim, 23, who was left dead and unable to tell her story, and decided to do something about it. It began with a simple Facebook update. 'It's hard to define what exactly about . this case grabbed everyone - there are just some cases that break through . the endemic numbness we feel round these endemic stories,' Farber told MailOnline. 'It seemed this was a tipping point. 'I posted on Facebook how I felt about it and . an actress from Mumbai, Poorna Jagannathan, contacted me and said you need to come here . and break the silence of what has happened here.' Performance: Two of the play's actresses - left, Poorna Jagnnathan, right, Priyanka Bose - performing in Nirbhaya . Farber, who is from Johannesburg, travelled with her six-year-old daughter to Delhi and worked with Jagannathan on formulating a narrative for the savage attack that shocked the world. The resulting play - Nirbhaya, Hindi for 'fearless', a name given to the victim at the time by the media - uses the 2012 attack as 'the spine' of the narrative, but weaves around it the stories of five further Indian victims of sexual violence. 'We use the story of . actual events - her rape and death - as the inciting incident,' Faber explained. 'It's the . narrative spine that we use to frame all the other testimonies, and the idea is to give a living example on stage of breaking the silence. 'We relive her life and death but woven around that narrative are the five testimonies of the other women, a bit like an ancient Greek chorus.' Faber: 'We use the story of actual events - her rape and death - as the inciting incident. It's the narrative spine that we use to frame all the other testimonies' What is, perhaps, most fascinating about Nirbhaya - and certainly what makes it so powerful - is that the performers themselves are the victims: each actor is narrating a version of her own story. 'Three of the women are actually actors, the other two are not. Their assaults cover a range of sexual violence, from child abuse and rape, to marital rape, to a woman - and this is obvious from her burn scars - who was a dowry bride whose husband . and brother-in-law set her on fire. And when she was recovering they left . with her son and she never saw him again.' Farber spent six months in Delhi with the women, getting to know them and finding the words with which to express what happened to them. They are her words, but they are their stories. Each 12-minute narrative is so powerful and so personal that audiences have been left completely speechless. A global crisis: Although the play is based upon sex attacks in India, Farber is keen to stress that the issue is not a localised one . Speaking about why she felt the need to tell the stories of the murdered Delhi student, and to allow these women to tell theirs, Farber said: 'There is a mythology in all cultures - not just those of India and South Africa - that in crimes of rape the shame and loss of honour lies with the victim. On 16 December 2012 in Munirka, a southern New Delhi neighbourhood, a 23-year-old female physiotherapy intern was savagely beaten and gang raped by six men on a bus, including the driver. The woman had been at the cinema with a male companion, and both of them were knocked unconscious, thrown from the bus and left for dead. The woman died 13 days later while being treated in hospital in Singapore. The attack sparked mass public protests against the goverment's lack of protection for women in India, and specifically New Delhi. The six accused - the youngest of whom was 17 at the time of the attack - were arrested and charged with rape, murder, robbery, kidnapping and assault. sexual assault and murder. The driver, Ram Singh, was found hanged on 11 March 2013 in the Tihar Jail. His family suspect 'foul play'. 'And by victim I mean both women and men, because rape happens to men, too. It is not a feminist issue, it is a human rights issue. 'Rape is the one crime in which the victim is asked if they brought it on themselves. But the attack on the bus seemed to trigger a zeitgeist in Delhi that said we are no longer able to tolerate this lie that is being held in place by a patriarchal misogyny. 'By these women speaking out - as triggered by this horrific death - it's a gesture towards reclaiming one's narrative and the right to speak, and the idea if placing culpability where it belongs: with the attacker, not with the victim. 'The piece says, ""Talk out, claim what happened to you as an event of your life so you can begin to move away from the myth that the perpetrator is not accountable and that you are"".' Although the play is based upon sex attacks in India, Farber is keen to stress that the issue is not a localised one. 'We have sex attack statistics in . Johannesburg that equal those in Delhi - both have been named ""the rape . capital of the world"" - but this is not an Indian or a South African . crisis. It is a global one. 'The rape statistics are . astonishingly high - and growing - in the UK and in America. There is . something deeply out of kilter that needs to be addressed.' The importance of the audience: 'Being witnessed is the most important aspect of telling a story: if you tell your story to a silent hall, you're still living in silence' The problem, Farber feels, is that we're all moving too fast. 'The question of why things are getting worse is complex, but it's a very anxious world, a world of tremendous shift and change all the time, and when there is a destabilising shift in society the most vulnerable members are always hit: usually children and women. 'Commerce plays an enormous role: a woman's body has become so objectified - in that her legs are used to sell cars, her lips to sell food or beer - that there's a myth about what a woman actually is. And it's anything but an actual person. 'We grow men who are exposed to a constant range of images.' And as the mother of a six-year-old girl, Farber is worried about the sort of place her daughter will be expected to take in the world. 'I see this onslaught of what she is exposed to,' she explains. 'Messages of how she will be seen. I feel such an urgency around this particular issue, and I think it is exacerbated by the fact I have a daughter, but ultimately I am a theatre-maker, and if I had a son I'd feel it too. 'I'd be desperate to raise a young man who didn't see women this way, who didn't support this idea that a woman will always be anything except herself.' Mother's concern: Playwright Yael Farber, who is worried about the sort of place her six-year-old daughter will be expected to take in the world if people don't speak out about sex crime . The production also seems to act as a kind of therapy for the actors involved, allowing them to take ownership of their stories. 'We're still brand new, only eight or nine performances old,' said Farber. 'But the velocity with which it's happening is enormous. As we sit and talk as a company you see the power of what happens when the actors begin to take possession of their narratives. 'But it's not only the performers who are important to the claiming of the stories - the audience plays a crucial role. 'Being witnessed is the most important aspect of telling a story: if you tell your story to a silent hall, you're still living in silence.' Nirbhaya is being performed at the Assembly Hall in Edinburgh until 26 August.","Yael Farber, a playwright from Johannesburg, is staging play in Edinburgh .

The search for a 14-year-old Colorado girl is becoming increasingly desperate as her disappearance enters its second week. Alexandra 'Ali' Ponte was last seen on September 4 when she left her home after a fight with her mother, Christina Duis. The teen had posted an unflattering self-penned rap song about her mother and her step-father on Facebook, and Duis banned her from the social networking site. Missing teen: Fears for the safety of 14-year-old Ali Ponte, who has now been missing for eight days, are growing . 'It wasn't a very nice rap. It was about her stepfather and me,' Duis told ABC News. 'The gist of it was she feels unloved, and she's angry and hurt.' Following the argument, Ponte left the house and was given a lift to Memorial Park in Woodland Park, Colorado, by a friend's mother. According to ABC News, Ponte told the mom that she was meeting up with another friend at the park, and would be sleeping the night at the friend's home. Agony: Ponte's mother Christina Duis, seen here with her daughter's beloved puppy Sophie, is desperate to know where Ali is . Missed: Investigators believe Ponte intended to run away from home, but now fear she has been kidnapped as her absence stretches to eight days . But when Ponte's mother called to check up on her daughter, she discovered that she had never had any plans to sleep over at her friend's home that night. Two men told police they saw Ponte walking along Baldwin Street behind the local high school at about 9:10pm that night. After that, the teen disappeared, and there are grave concerns for her safety. Investigators fear the teen may have been kidnapped after running away from home. 'There are no words. My heart is just breaking,' Duis told ABC News through tears. 'We just want her to know that she's not in trouble. We just want her to . come home,' she said. A Facebook page, Help Find Ali Ponte aka Alexandra Renee Ponte, has been set up to help find the girl. 'It's devastating to think you could lose a . child. So I have to hold on to hope that she's still alive and she's . still going to come home,' said Ponte's mother. Social media ban: Ponte left her home angry after an argument with her mother that resulted in a Facebook ban . Hope: Ali Ponte's family is hopeful that she has run away and is holed up somewhere safe and will soon come home . Local park: The teen was dropped off at Memorial Park by her friend's mother - and hasn't been home since . Ponte is described as being white, 115lbs and five feet five inches tall. She was wearing jeans and a bright blue hooded sweatshirt and had her brown hair in a ponytail. She was carrying a gray-and-black Nike backpack. The FBI has been helping local police with their investigations by tracking Ponte's cell phone signals, but had difficulty getting a reading, and now according to ABC News, the phone has gone dead. Volunteers are planning to meet this Saturday at Woodland Park High School to continue the search. 'I just wish I would have hugged her more. I just wish I would have told her how much I love her more. I don't think she really knows,' Duis told ABC News. Detective Sean Goings told KRDO that police are investigating a tip from a friend of Ponte's who said she was seen in Ellicott.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:26 EST, 30 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:26 EST, 30 March 2012 . A terrifying catalogue of people have been left injured, maimed and poisoned by negligent medics, new NHS figures reveal. The dossier of slip-ups includes patients killed by being given drugs intended for others, people left conscious as surgeons start to operate on them and dozens of victims who wake from surgery to find swabs and needles have been accidentally left inside them. The list of NHS horrors also includes faulty equipment giving patients incorrect ‘all-clear’ results and name mix-ups leading to surgeons operating on the wrong people. Confusion: Name mix-ups have led to surgeons operating on the wrong people . A collection of statistics, released in a Freedom of Information survey, shows for the first time how critical mistakes are being made on a daily basis inside the NHS. Officials logged 760 so-called 'serious untoward incidents' last year in the NHS made up of 263 surgical blunders, 50 equipment failures and 447 drug incidents. Other medical gaffs included NHS South East Coast logging three incidents where people had the incorrect lens fitted to their eyes during cataract surgery and a number of patients had items like a feeding tube and swabs accidentally left inside them. They even had to deal with one case where the anti-bacterial hand wash used on the wards kept vanishing - only to find a patient was responsible for drinking it. NHS South West admitted it had incidents where surgeons removed the wrong teeth from a patient and in two separate cases an operation was needlessly carried out after a misdiagnosis. In NHS West Midlands medics got two patients mixed up resulted in one having a biopsy when it should have been taken from another patient with the same name. A hospital within the same organisation had a failure of its emergency bleep system because of the theft of metal cabling. A patient being treated for a . gynaecological procedure at NHS South Central ended up having to undergo . an operation to remove a piece of forceps from her, after they broke . off during the examination. The NHS paid out more than £2million to patients who woke from surgery to find an item has been accidentally left inside them . ab13878.jpg . In separate data hospitals recorded 4,121 people who needed additional care because they suffered an accidental cut, puncture, perforation or internal bleeding while being treated for something else, an increase of 42per cent in the last five years. Another 199 hospital patients had items unintentionally left inside them following surgery or other medical treatments. These people needed almost another 800 nights in hospital to sort out the problem. There were also 45 patients who suffered adverse effects because the equipment used on them had not been sterilised properly, while another 85 people were given emergency care as a result of not being given the correct medicines during surgery. Hospitals also revealed around 3,500 people suffered complications because a medical device or piece of equipment failed to work properly. The NHS admitted that it paid out more than £2million to patients last year who woke from surgery to find an item has been accidentally left inside them. Each victim was paid an average of around £12,500 for the anguish and pain caused by the NHS error. Another £310,000 was paid out by the NHS to people who found out that surgeons operated on the wrong part of their body. The most common mistakes were made in relation to extracting the wrong teeth but medics have also blundered by operating on the incorrect ear, eye, kidney and knee. A total of 52 patients sued the NHS for a total of £2.8million because they had been allowed to go home from hospital too soon, before they developed severe complications. Joyce Robins, Co-director of Patient Concern, said: 'The level of mistakes in the NHS is both shocking and frightening. There are inherent risks in modern medicine and some accidents are inevitable. 'But we should not have to fear going home with extra unwanted bits left inside us, the wrong part of our body mutilated or complications caused by dirty equipment. 'Patient Concern sees no end to avoidable disasters as long as safety protocols, procedures and guidance remain advisory rather than mandatory. 'A comprehensive and successful system of checks before every operation was brought over from the USA. But it is a lucky dip whether your hospital and operating team have adopted this check list, because in the NHS each trust is free to do as it likes. Imagine the consequences of the aviation industry treating compliance with safety rules as optional!' A spokesman for the Department of Health said: 'The vast majority of NHS patients experience good quality, safe and effective care and the UK is seen as one of the world leaders in the international drive to improve the safety of healthcare. 'Only a very small number of errors put patients at serious risk but we have made it clear that unsafe care is not to be tolerated.'","Officials logged 760 'serious untoward incidents' last year in the NHS .

Ethiopian farmer Dhaqabo Ebba claims to be a staggering 160 years old, which would make him the world's oldest living man. However, there is no birth certificate to prove his age . In a statement to Oromiya TV, he provided so much detail on the history of his local area that reporter Mohammed Ademo became convinced that Mr Ebba must be at least 160 years old. This would make him 46 years older than the oldest ever recorded man. 'When Italy invaded Ethiopia I had two wives,and my son was old enough to herd cattle', said Mr Ebba. Record breaker: If Mr Ebba's claims are true, they would see him overtake French woman Jeanne Calment as the oldest person to have ever lived. She died aged 122 years and 164 days in 1997 . He then recounted his eight-day horseback rides to Addis Ababa as a child - a journey that takes only a few hours today. As Mr Ebba grew up in an oral society, there is no paper trail and no living witnesses to verify his age. However, if his claim can be medically confirmed, he would oust 115-year-old Misao Okawa, who is currently recognized by the Guinness World Records as the world's oldest living person. He would also overtake French woman Jeanne Calment as the oldest person to have ever lived. Ms Calment died in 1997 at the age of 122. The last man confirmed to have lived in the 19th century was Jiroemon Kimura, who was born in Japan on April 19, 1897. He died in June this year at the age of 116 - making him the longest-living man in history. Mr Kimura, who lived in Kyotango, Japan, left behind seven children, 14 grandchildren, 25 great-grandchildren and 15 great-great-grandchildren. According to 2011 government data, Japan has more than 50,000 centenarians, reinforcing its reputation for longevity.","Retired farmer Dhaqabo Ebba, from Ethiopia, claims to be 160 years old .

British soldiers face new criminal prosecutions over the death of a hotel receptionist in Iraq. Investigators examining claims that UK troops abused and murdered innocent civilians have identified fresh lines of inquiry linked to the case of Baha Mousa which could lead to new charges. Only one serviceman has ever been convicted over Mr Mousa’s death. British soldiers face new criminal prosecutions over the death of a Baha Mousa (pictured with one of his sons) Corporal Donald Payne became the first member of the Armed Forces to be convicted of a war crime after he pleaded guilty to inhumanely treating civilians. He was jailed for one year and dismissed from the Army. But the issue is set to rumble on for at least another three years, even though ten years have elapsed since Mr Mousa was killed and more than £50million of taxpayers’ money has been earmarked for trials and a public inquiry. Despite the seriousness of an episode which heaped shame on the Army, critics will question whether reopening the case is a justified use of the cash-strapped Ministry of Defence’s time and resources. After trawling through thousands of documents and other pieces of evidence connected to the case, the Iraq Historic Allegations Team said yesterday that it wanted to speak to ‘several’ soldiers. The development paves the way for current and former British service personnel to be hauled before the courts for another trial. Some could face a retrial after being cleared at an earlier court martial. The mother and son of Baha Mousa. The hotel receptionist collapsed and died after sustaining 93 injuries . The IHAT investigation is part of an . inquiry set to cost £35million and last until the end of 2016. It is . examining claims of abuses in Iraq by UK forces personnel from 2003 to . July 2009. Mr Mousa, 26, an innocent hotel receptionist, died after being seized by UK forces during a raid on suspected insurgents in Basra, southern Iraq, in September 2003. Dr Derek Keilloh was struck off previously for failing to report details of the war crime while working as a young Army medic in Iraq . They wrongly believed the father of two was a terrorist involved in the murder of four of their colleagues. He was taken to Darul Dhyafa military base for questioning where he was so badly beaten he collapsed after sustaining 93 injuries, including fractured ribs and a broken nose. In September 2011, a public inquiry found Mr Mousa and nine other detainees suffered ‘an appalling episode of serious gratuitous violence’ by members of 1st Battalion the Queen’s Lancashire Regiment (1QLR). The inquiry, led by Sir William Gage, named 19 soldiers said to have assaulted detainees. Survivors claimed they endured humiliating mistreatment and brutality, including interrogation techniques banned by the Government. At a court martial in 2006-07, seven soldiers from 1QLR, including its former commanding officer, Colonel Jorge Mendonca, faced charges relating to the killing of Mr Mousa and to the other detainees. But the £20million trial ended with all being cleared apart from Corporal Payne. GP Derek Keilloh was struck off for failing to report details of the war crime while working as a young Army medic in Iraq. The MoD has paid £2.83million in compensation to the families of Mr Mousa and nine other Iraqi men abused by British soldiers.","Only one serviceman has ever been convicted over Baha Mousa's death .

Hate preacher Abu Hamza's most trusted lieutenant cannot be kicked out of Britain because being sent to America to face terror charges would breach his human rights, it emerged today. European judges have ruled that terror suspect and Broadmoor patient Haroon Aswat cannot be deported because it would be bad for his mental health. Aswat, who claims to be a schizophrenic, . is wanted by the U.S. authorities for plotting to set up a jihadi . training camp in Bly, Oregon. The European Court of Human Rights has upheld its decision not to allow the extremist to leave the UK for America after a Home Office appeal failed. Ruling: Haroon Aswat (right), pictured with radical cleric Abu Hamza al Masri, has been told today he will not be extradited from Britain to the United States . This was despite the Government getting assurances from U.S. officials that his mental health would be taken into account when considering if he can stand trial or where he would be held. Unless his schizophrenia improves then he will stay in a British secure jail. Aswat had claimed that the jail term he . might face in America  – up to 50 years without parole – breached . Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which bans . ‘inhuman or degrading treatment’. Aswat had faced being sent to the Colorado Supermax prison, which is surrounded by desert, and known as the 'Alcatraz of the Rockies'. It is home to 400 of America's most dangerous convicts, where they live in a cramped cell measuring 12ft by 7ft. European judges heard that Aswat has an 'enduring mental disorder', with 'auditory hallucinations, thought disorder, delusions of reference, grandeur and guarded and suspicious behaviour'. The Home Office wanted the case to go Europe's top court, the Grand Chamber, but this was refused. Claim: Aswat said up to 50 years without parole in the Supermax jail in Florence, Colorado - the Alcatraz of the Rockies - would breach his human rights . MP James Clappison, told the Daily Telegraph: 'The Government should at least have been given permission to take this to the Grand Chamber. 'It deserves much more consideration than the European Court of Human Rights has given it.' Anger: Home Affairs Select Committee member James Clappison has criticised the decision . A Home Office spokesman added: 'We are disappointed by the panel's decision not to refer the case to the Grand Chamber. 'The Home Secretary does not believe extradition would breach Haroon Aswat's human rights and she will now consider what options are available in this case'. Hamza and four other terror suspects . were extradited last year after the European Court of Human Rights . (ECHR) rejected their appeal against the move - but Aswat's case was . adjourned to allow judges more time to consider his mental health. Aswat, . who was born in 1974 and is being treated for schizophrenia, claims . that if he is extradited and convicted in the US he would be at risk of . ill-treatment inside the so-called supermax prison ADX Florence, in . Colorado. Last year, the ECHR ruled that five men including Hamza would not face ill treatment if they were extradited to the US. Hamza, Babar Ahmad, Seyla Talha Ahsan, Adel Abdul Bary and Khaled Al-Fawwaz were all removed from the country. Hamza, . who was serving a seven-year sentence in Britain for soliciting to . murder and inciting racial hatred when he was extradited, has denied 11 . counts of criminal conduct related to the taking of 16 hostages in Yemen . in 1998 and advocating violent jihad in Afghanistan in 2001. He . is also accused of conspiring to establish the Oregon-based jihad . training camp between June 2000 and December 2001. Aswat was indicted as .

Mr Dixson was also suspected in a tenth rape in the Fair Park neighborhood, but officials appear to have moved in a different direction with that investigation. Got him!: US Marshall's tracked serial rape suspect to Baton Rouge, LA, and arrested him early Wednesday morning . On the run since this past weekend, Mr Dixson was spotted outside a downtown Baton Rouge hotel and immediately arrested, according to reports. It will take a couple of days for him to be extradited back to Texas to face rape accusations. The former neighbourhood watch captain was wearing the same gold-rimmed glasses that victims described their attacker as wearing, NBC DFW noted. Officials found him after an anonymous tip.

Police told local media that they believe Dixson ended up in Baton Rouge because he couldn’t afford to go any further. ‘The only indication we have is that this was as far his money would allow him to go – because he had very little money on him when we did apprehend him’ a US Marshall’s Office spokesperson said during a press conference in the city. Also previously reported were Mr Dixson’s prior arrests, of which his neighbors were unaware.

He was also arrested last month for deadly conduct after he pointed a gun at someone. X marks the spot: Mr Dixson lived with his children in this house, in the Fair Park area of South Dallas . Calling Mr Dixson’s arrest a ‘relief to the community,’ Alendra Lyons, president of the Mill City Community Association – the neighborhood watch group Mr Dixson patrolled the Fair Park area for at night, told the station that she plans to look into criminal background checks for new recruits. ‘At least we would be aware of what they have dealt with in the past,’ added Ms Lyons.
