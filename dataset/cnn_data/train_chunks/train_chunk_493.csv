Forming a majestic gatehouse from Trafalgar Square to Buckingham Palace, it will certainly be able to offer rooms with a view. After years housing civil servants’ dilapidated offices, Admiralty Arch, one of London’s best-known landmarks, is to become a luxury hotel, it was announced yesterday. And with Rafael Serrano, the Spanish developer behind the glitzy Bulgari Hotel in Knightsbridge, heading the project, it should be eye-catching at the very least. Majestic: Admiralty Arch, one of London's best-known landmarks, is to become a luxury hotel . Some critics have panned the Bulgari – . the most expensive place to stay in Britain, with even the cheapest . rooms from £850 a night – for its ‘brash’ and ‘tasteless’ decor, dubbing . it the ‘Vulgari’. Now Mr Serrano’s London-based firm . Prime Investors Capital has bought Grade I-listed Admiralty Arch for . £60million, there is talk of ‘subtle illuminations’ on the outside, and a . sumptuous ballroom and spa inside. But at a press conference to unveil . the sale yesterday, Mr Serrano was quick to stress that the 100-year-old . building’s period features will be painstakingly preserved as part of . the deal. When the arch’s sale was announced . last year, it was contingent on the building being made accessible to . the public for the first time, with a museum mooted as an option. National celebrations: The building has been part of many celebrations, including the Queen's Diamond Jubilee procession this year, over the last century . Five-star luxury: Prime Investors Capital intends to convert the building into a five-star 100-bedroom hotel with royal and presidential suites, a ballroom, spa and fine dining restaurant . Turning it into a five-star hotel will inevitably invite criticism that the arch will be accessible only to the super-rich. Mr Serrano said the hotel should . attract 50,000 guests a year in its 100 guestrooms, with a further . 50,000 visiting its bars and restaurants, which will be open to the . public. The development will also create hundreds of jobs. With nearby six-bedroom houses on the market for £30million, £60million might seem a snip. But the deal is to restore the arch during a 99-year lease, a project which will probably cost hundreds of millions. Spread over eight storeys, the . 147,300 sq ft building is not being used at present, is falling into . disrepair and has £900,000-a-year running costs, which Cabinet Office . Minister Francis Maude said amounted to a ‘tragic waste of an historic . building’. Affair: John Prescott and Tracey Temple at his private flat at Admiralty Arch, February, 2006 . Royal history: Beefeaters march through the arch on Coronation Day in May 1937 . Inside the arch: Used as the Cabinet Office headquarters, the public has rarely seen inside the building. Cabinet minister Francis Maude said the plans 'will bring this London landmark back to life' 'Great shame': In the 100 years since it opened, the building has had virtually no public access, including the south block staircase, but Mr Maude says that the Government wants to 'preserve it for future generations' No decision has yet been made on what the hotel will be called or who will run it. The team will liaise with the . Government on the security implications, due to its sensitive position . overlooking Whitehall and the Mall. Buckingham Palace has been consulted, while the Government retains the freehold and still has the final say in its development. The sale does not include Admiralty . House, next door, which dates from 1788 and has provided . grace-and-favour apartments for politicians including former deputy . prime minister John Prescott. Property investor Rafael Serrano is also behind the Bulgari Hotel in Knightsbridge. Room prices start at £850 and that's before service charges, tips and refreshments . Ostentatious: The Bulgari is the UK's most expensive hotel. Despite this, it is almost always completely booked .

A World War II veteran who inspired many with his determination to vote even though he had end-stage liver cancer has died. Frank Tanabe's daughter Barbara Tanabe says he died Wednesday morning at her Honolulu home. He was 93. Hundreds of thousands of people saw a photo of Frank Tanabe filling out his absentee ballot with the help of his daughter last week, after his nephew posted the picture on the social media site Reddit. Patriotism: Veteran Frank Tanabe, pictured filling out his absentee ballot from his bed in Honolulu with the help of his daughter Barbara (left) and wife Setsuko (right), as died at age 93 . Frank Tanabe served in a mostly Japanese-American unit of the Military Intelligence Service during WWII. He volunteered to join the Army from the Tule Lake internment camp in California. Honolulu elections officials say his vote will be counted unless they receive his death certificate before the November 6 election and are able to single out his ballot from those submitted. The photo of Tanabe - lying in a hospital bed at home as his daughter Barbara Tanabe helps him fill out his absentee ballot - captured the hearts of tens of thousands of Internet users. Half a million people saw the picture on Reddit after it was posted on Thursday, making it one of the most popular items on the social media network for a day after. 'True Patriotism,' was the top rated comment on the post. 'This is America. Amen,' was next, followed by 'Thank you, Citizen.' Doctors diagnosed Tanabe with an inoperable cancer tumor in his liver two months ago. He's been in hospice care for the past three weeks at his daughter's home. Protect and serve: Frank Tanabe, a Japanese-American, was placed in an internment camp before serving in military intelligence during the Second World War . He was determined to vote regardless, eagerly asking when the ballot would be arriving in the mail, his daughter said. She kept telling him, 'don't worry, it's coming.' He filled it out immediately when it landed in the mailbox on Wednesday. Barbara Tanabe read aloud the names of the candidates to her dad. He either nodded 'yes' to the names or shook his head 'no.' She filled in the boxes on his behalf, following his instructions even when he didn't pick the people she wanted. 'There were some that were OK, but there were others where I said, ''Dad, are you sure?'"" she said. But he knew what he was doing. He's kept up on the issues, reading newspapers regularly until only recently, she said. Tanabe volunteered to join the Army from behind barbed wire at the Tule Lake internment camp in California. Pride: Frank Tanabe holds a replica of the Congressional Gold Medal in Washington, D.C., awarded collectively to Japanese-American veterans of World War II, including those who served in his unit, the Military Intelligence Service . He was pulled out of college at the University of Washington and taken to the camp when President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered 110,000 Japanese-Americans detained and isolated after the start of the war with Japan. The Army assigned Tanabe to the Military Intelligence Service, a classified unit whose members were collectively awarded the Congressional Gold Medal last year along with soldiers who served in the 100th Infantry Battalion and 442nd Regimental Combat Team - highly decorated segregated units of mostly Japanese-Americans. 'I'd like to accept on behalf of all hyphenated Americans, including American-Americans,' Tanabe told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser at the time. 'We all served together in defense of our country.' Noah Tanabe, the nephew who posted the photo online, said he thinks about his uncle every time he votes. Tradition: Frank Tanabe as a baby with his mother Katsuko Okamoto Tanabe . 'It's hard to imagine - after his . family business is torched, his family imprisoned, and denied the . opportunity to finish his college education - he volunteered to serve. I . don't know if I would have done the same thing, but we are all very . proud of him,' he said. The family has been surprised and gratified by the online comments on the photo, Barbara Tanabe said. 'I . think he feels like joining the Army, going to the camp, fighting in . the war, and fighting discrimination - these were all things he did so . that we have this precious right to vote,' she said. 'For so many people to express their heartfelt tribute to my father was really, really heartwarming for us.' Several Reddit commentators asked whether Tanabe's vote would be counted if he passed away before Election Day on November 6. Glenn Takahashi, Honolulu election . administrator, said absentee ballots cast by voters who later die become . invalid if the state Department of Health notifies elections officials . of the death before Election Day. To . void a ballot when that happens, officials have to be able to sort . through tens of thousands of ballots to find the one in question. This . is not always practical, and so the ballot is counted if it isn't. A similar situation arose in Honolulu . four years ago when President Obama's grandmother died two nights . before the election but after she mailed her absentee ballot. Hawaii counted her vote anyway because the Health Department didn't receive her certificate of death before the election. Barbara . Tanabe said her father, a quiet, unassuming man, would wonder what the . fuss over the photo was about. But he'd be thrilled it encouraged others . to vote, she said. 'That would be the ultimate honor for him,' she said.

Parents will have to give highly intrusive details of their love lives to the taxman when cuts to child benefit are introduced in January, it was revealed today. Snooper squads working for HM Revenue & Customs will use credit reference agencies to probe exactly when couples get together and split up, tax experts warned yesterday. Tax experts warned that the Treasury’s plans to slash the handouts for higher earners will see adults living together being forced to reveal when they become partners. Mother and father: At present, all parents with young children are given the benefit worth £20.30 a week for the first child and £13.40 for each subsequent child . Partners will also have to reveal often private details of their incomes to each other. At present, all parents with young children are given the benefit worth £20.30 a week for the first child and £13.40 for each subsequent child. For a couple with two children, the handout is worth £1,752 a year. But Chancellor George Osborne is planning to cut the benefit if one parent, or both of them, is earning over £50,000 and stop it altogether where one receives £60,000. The reforms will force half a million couples to fill in a self-assessment tax form for the first time. This is because instead of those earning more than £50,000 being paid less child benefit, the Government plans to keep paying full child benefit and then to claw it back through the tax system. When parents split and, for example, the woman starts to live with a new partner who earns more than £50,000, child benefit will be clawed back from him via the tax system. Idea: Chancellor George Osborne is planning to cut the benefit if one parent, or both of them, is earning over £50,000 and stop it altogether where one receives £60,000 . The taxman will have the right to ask men and women about their living arrangements to establish if they are in a relationship and if either is a high earner. 'Couples may need to disclose their income to each other, simply to see if they are affected, which goes against the long established principle of independent taxation' Tax accountants Baker Tilly . Tax accountants Baker Tilly warned that tax advisers ‘will need to know how many weeks claimants were living as partners’ in a given year. ‘Couples may also need to disclose their income to each other, simply to see if they are affected, which goes against the long established principle of independent taxation,’ it said. Karen Clark, the firm’s head of personal tax, said: ‘Claimants will now have to establish exactly when they became, or ceased to become, a “couple” and I think many will be surprised at having to share that level of intimate detail with HMRC.’ Robin Williamson, of the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, told MPs on the Treasury select committee that the child benefit changes could be as big a shambles as Gordon Brown’s tax credits. Paperwork: The taxman will have the right to ask men and women about their living arrangements to establish if they are in a relationship and if either is a high earner . Out of date information on credit reports could lead to people who have split up being unjustly stripped of the payments. He said there was a danger that, as happened with tax credits, HMRC will falsely accuse single claimants of being part of a couple, and will therefore claw back too much tax. 'If you want to form a relationship with somebody you might have to ask them what their income is if it’s going to impact on the child benefit' Robin Williamson, Low Incomes Tax Reform Group . ‘They tend to use the credit reference agencies in order to decide whether or not someone has an undisclosed partner,’ he said. Mr Williamson added: ‘If you want to form a relationship with somebody you might have to ask them what their income is if it’s going to impact on the child benefit.’ An HMRC spokesman said: ‘Couples who do not wish to disclose their income to each other will be able to find out from HMRC what they need to know without obtaining details of the other partner’s income.’ A Treasury spokesman said: This is the simplest way of withdrawing child benefit from the wealthiest 15 per cent and avoids highly intrusive means-testing of all eight million households in the UK.’","Partners could have to reveal often private details of incomes to each other .

David Cameron claims he is not happy about multinational firms like Apple not paying enough tax in Britain – but that has not stopped the Prime Minister from accepting a free iPad from the technology giant. New details of gifts received by ministers show the PM has kept the freebie for ‘official use’. Mr Cameron is a known fan of iPad games like Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja, which have sparked claims that he spends too much time ‘chillaxing’. Under Whitehall rules, ministers must declare all gifts worth more than £140. Unless they choose to pay for items out of their own pocket, they are usually stored away by officials. In 2010, Mr Cameron opted to purchase a £429 iPad given by headphones tycoon Mike Faith, but another tablet from New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was kept by the Cabinet Office. The latest details released for the first quarter of this year show that Mr Cameron received a leather jacket from President Barack Obama during a trip to the US in May, but chose not to purchase it. He also passed up the opportunity to own unspecified 'sportswear' given by Tory former chancellor Lord Lamont. But he is known to regularly use an iPad, in part to catch up with TV series such as The Killing while on the move. After completing Angry Birds, he graduated to Fruit Ninja, in which players slicing straberries, watermelons and pinapples with a samurai sword. Mr Cameron once said: 'It's quite good, to get your frustration out. If you can't have a reshuffle, play Fruit Ninja.' However, a special app has reportedly been created to help him keep on top of Government and economic data.

In the Commons, Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘Apple, Google, Facebook, eBay and Starbucks have between them avoided nearly £900 million of tax. ‘Will the Prime Minister now take this opportunity to condemn their behaviour as morally wrong?’ she asked. Mr Cameron said Ms Hodge had made ‘an important point’. He added: ‘This is an international problem that all countries are struggling with: how to make sure that companies pay tax in an appropriate way. ‘I am not happy with the current situation; Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs needs to look at it very carefully. 'We need to make sure that we are encouraging these businesses to invest in our country - as they are doing - but they should be paying fair taxes as well.’","Prime Minister retained the expensive gadget for 'official use' in April .

Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson has lost out to his arch-rivals in a battle over air routes to Russia. But watchdogs say passengers will benefit through cheaper and more 'dynamic' fares and that British Airways and easyJet's plans were 'likely to deliver the greatest benefit to consumers'. The tycoon learned tonight that his airline Virgin Atlantic had been rejected by aviation regulators in a fight to operate UK to Moscow flights. Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson lost out to British Airways in a battle over air routes to Russia . With more flights now available between the UK and Russia, British Airways, easyJet and Virgin had been vying for the right to fly on the London-Moscow route. The Civil Aviation Authority ruled that BA, which already operates to Moscow, and easyJet should be allowed to take up the Moscow flights - meaning that Virgin had missed out. The decision follows the Department for Transport ruling in August that FirstGroup rather than Virgin Rail should take up a new 13-year franchise on the West Coast Main Line. Sir Richard launched a legal challengers against the ruling and the DfT has now scrapped the West Coast bidding process, suspended three civil servants and asked Virgin to carry on for the time being. The CAA's two-from-three decision came after what is known as a scarce capacity hearing at which a panel of CAA board members considered the arguments put forward by each of the applicant airlines. The panel decided to allow BA to continue to operate the services it currently operates from London Heathrow to Moscow's Domodedovo Airport and to grant easyJet permission to operate between London Gatwick and Moscow Domodedovo. With more flights now available between the UK and Russia, British Airways, easyJet and Virgin had been vying for the right to fly on the London-Moscow route . The Civil Aviation Authority ruled that BA, which already operates to Moscow, and easyJet should be allowed to take up the Moscow flights . Iain Osborne, the CAA's director of regulatory policy, and chairman of the panel, said: 'On balance, allocating scarce capacity to BA and easyJet is likely to deliver the greatest benefit to consumers. 'EasyJet's proposal will introduce an innovative product into the market and has the potential to deliver the greatest dynamic fare benefits for consumers.' He added: 'We concluded that easyJet's proposal would introduce a distinctly different product into the market and would stimulate innovation on the route as a whole, as well as satisfying and stimulating consumer demand that is currently under-served, in particular, people who prefer or are content to use Gatwick.' The CAA said easyJet was expected to begin operating services to Moscow from early 2013. The CAA understands that BA will continue with its current schedule. EasyJet said it would operate an Airbus A320 on two services a day between Gatwick and Moscow. Each aircraft will have 180 seats and the airline expects to fly more than 230,000 passengers in its first year of operations. EasyJet chief executive Carolyn McCall said: 'We are delighted to have been awarded the rights to fly between Gatwick and Moscow. 'We believe this is the right decision for consumers both in the UK and Russia.' A Virgin Atlantic spokeswoman said: 'We are very disappointed with the result of the CAA hearing which we believe flies in the face of what the consumer wants and our economy demands. 'Data shows that passengers travelling between Moscow and London want to use Heathrow airport and not Gatwick, long haul connectivity is far greater via Heathrow and this decision will also reduce capacity between the two capitals.' 'We are perplexed by what we consider a very short-sighted decision. We will review the CAA's report in full before considering all of our options.'","British Airways, easyJet and Virgin were vying for the right to fly the route .

AA patrolmen are now being trained as plumbers under new plans which could see them unblocking toilets when they are not jump starting cars. It is part of a trial which was launched in Northern Ireland over summer. The scheme aims to boost the AA’s home repair service, and could be rolled out across the UK following a trial over the summer in Northern Ireland. But the move has been branded a cost-cutting exercise by unions. Plumbing patrol: AA patrolmen are being trained as plumbers to boost their home repair service . The plan comes after reports that AA, one of Britain’s best known brands, could soon be up for sale for about £5 billion. Acromas, owner of the 107-year-old . motoring organisation, has appointed accountants Ernst & Young to . look at options for the sale which is not expected to start until early . next year. Patrols as plumbers has the potential to be introduced in other parts of the UK, Operations Manager Keith Munns said. According to The Sun, an internal memo from Mr Munns said: ‘We have trained up a number of roadside patrols to carry out basic plumbing activity. For sale: The plans comes after reports that AA, one of Britain's most iconic brands, could soon be up for sale for about £5¿billion . ‘By the time we get to winter we will . know whether that has worked and it may well be that we have rolled . that out a little bit further.’ The plumbers training is designed to . strengthen AA’s Home Emergency Repair service which launched two years . ago promising ‘trusted and skilled tradesmen’ that can fix leaks, burst . pipes and toilets in the home. But Paul Grafton of GMB union said: ‘This is all about money.’ Earlier this month, the company . announced that they expected more than 400 jobs to be lost at the AA . call centre in Cardiff, blaming the rise in online transactions. Some 3,000 staff left the company in 2004 during the restructure of AA when it was sold by Centrica, the company that runs British Gas, to CVC and Permira. Acromas was then formed in 2007 when the AA . merged with Saga, an over-50s insurance, financial services, holidays and healthcare specialist. Since then, the AA has grown . from around 7,000 to 8,500 employees. The Automobile Association (AA) formed in 1905 when a group of motoring enthusiasts met at the Trocadero restaurant in London’s West End. The group initially intended to champion the motorist’s cause and help drivers avoid police speed traps. The AA’s 100 members in 1905 grew to 83,000 by 1914. The first AA patrols used basic pedal cycles and had no uniforms. They patrolled Brighton and Portsmouth roads where their official duties were ‘indicating dangers on the road and helping motorists who had broken down’. In 1907 the first AA insurance policy was launched and by 1912 AA was inspecting and classifying hotels. The AA then opened the first roadside filling station in 1920 at Aldermaston in Berkshire and by 1932 they opened ten more. With the introduction of the two-way radio after WWII, the night-time breakdown service was launched in 1949. In 1950 the AA hit the one million members milestone. An advertising campaign in the 1990s branded the AA the fourth emergency service. The AA joined the Centrica group, the company that runs British Gas, in a £1.1billion acquisition in 1999 before its acquisition by private equity firms CVC and Permira for £1.75billion.","The company has already trialled the scheme in Northern Ireland .

Holy place: The self-immolation took place at Labrang monastery, which is one of the largest in Tibetan Buddhism . Self-immolation as a way of protesting against Beijing's heavy-handed rule in the region  has increased in the past 18 months, Free Tibet said. A reported 56 Tibetans have set themselves alight in ethnic Tibetan areas of China since March 2011. The Chinese government has confirmed some of the self-immolations. The Dalai Lama and representatives of the self-declared Tibetan government-in-exile in India say they oppose all violence. 'Tibetan protests are escalating,' Free Tibet director Stephanie Brigden said in a statement. 'Dhondup is the eighth Tibetan in the last month alone who has risked his life to protest Chinese rule; seven of the eight have died.' She said China's government could recognize that Tibetan demands for freedom cannot be extinguished by force and that it ""must enter into meaningful dialogue with Tibetan representatives, supported by the international community.' China says Tibet has always been part of its territory, but many Tibetans say the Himalayan region was virtually independent for centuries until Chinese troops invaded in the 1950s. Beijing blames the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, for fanning anti-government sentiment and routinely purges monasteries and nunneries, where support for the Dalai Lama and Tibetan independence runs high. Angry and desperate Tibetans have taken to self-immolation in protest, a centuries-long tradition which has become a type of radical political protest. More than 500 have been reported in Western media since the 1960s. In March this year a Tibetan man self-immolated in New Delhi, India, to protest a visit by the Chinese president. In May, one man died and another was seriously injured after they set themselves alight in China's Qinghai province, shouting pro-independence song and holding Tibetan flags. The controversial method of protest is much debated among Tibetans themselves. Some Buddhists say suicide is violence, and therefore unacceptable, while others see self-sacrifice for a greater cause as legitimate.","Seventh Tibetan dies from self-immolation this month .

It may sound like a lot of old carp, but the England fishing team are crying foul after suspected cheating led to Romania triumphing at a global fishing competition . England's team of freshwater fishermen have launched a formal protest after they lost the 14th World Carp Angling Championships. They have accused the hosts Romania of using 'special bait' to hook first place in the tournament. Something fishy going on? Romania celebrate their hooking first prize - to the protests of the English team . Catch of the day: Questions have been raised about the competition. Pictured are Krisztian Peter (left) and Norbert Barati of Hungary competing in the championship . Unbeknown to the England team, Romania spent nearly five months using a particular recipe to feed the fish in Lake Corbu where the competition took place, The Independent reported. Using boilies - a blend of flour, egg and flavouring - the dejected English team could only watch as the carp fell hook, line and sinker for the hosts bait, which they had eaten for weeks. Ian Huntington, team manager of the Korda England Carp Team, told The Independent that the secretive method was against the spirit of fair play, but conceded that it was not actually cheating as it did not break any rules. He said the team were deeply disappointed by the outcome of the competition. 'Hard lessons have been learnt and it . has been a very difficult experience to pick the team and ourselves up . after this event,' he told the newspaper. 'Within two hours of the match starting we were asking ourselves questions about the bait.' England were deeply disappointed when they learned that special bait was being used to lure all the carp and win the prizes . The carp were fed bait from boats tethered to the shore in Lake Corbu, months before the big championship . He said Romania would have a distinct advantage using bait that the fish had been previously fed with. Sadly for the competitive team, other countries had heard about the plot and cunningly bought a supply of local bait. They had learned of the plan when they practised on the lakes and had seen the bait tethered to boats, which had begun in May. Romania dominated the event and took the Team Gold and the Individual. Bulgaria were runners-up and Serbia clinched third place after both countries used the particular type of bait. The Angling Trust's international events manager Dick Clegg told The Independent that he would raise the issue at a meeting in November.

A newlywed bride is now a widow in mourning after her husband died of cancer just 12 days after their wedding. Paul Smith, a much-loved high school band director in Pinecrest, Florida who had dedicated his life to teaching music and investing in his local community, passed away on October 18 after a six-month battle with cancer. Despite his devastating diagnosis in April and the fast spreading disease, Smith, 48, and his fiancee Lisa Judy decided to tie the knot on October 6 to spend his remaining days as man and wife. Scroll down for video. Bittersweet: The beloved band teacher Paul Smith (center) married Lisa Judy (right) at a ceremony on October 6, with her son Wade (left) also attending. Smith, 48, passed away just 12 days after the wedding . Newlyweds: Though the groom was frail, his sickness couldn't stop him from celebrating with his new bride Lisa Judy at their wedding on October 6 . Smith received the devastating cancer diagnosis in April, after a night out with his fiancee and her son at a concert, when he became short of breath. Two days later doctors told him they discovered cancer in his kidneys and said they believed the cancer had metastasized. After 15 years on the . faculty of the Miami Palmetto Senior High School, he resigned to . undergo treatment but despite the chemo and multiple surgeries, his friend and fellow musician, Thom Proctor, told the MailOnline that Smith kept a positive outlook. 'He kept a good attitude, he kept fighting. He was that way his whole life,' Proctor, who directed Smith in their church brass ensemble, said. Lover of music: Paul Smith spent 15 years leading the band at the Miami Palmetto Senior High School . Proctor attended Smith's nuptials, which were planned in less than three weeks, this October . Describing the affair as 'so joyous,' he said the groom 'had the biggest grin on his face in the wheelchair.' 'We were all hoping that he would get through. At the wedding, he was doing pretty well,' but Smith took a turn for the worse and entered hospice and passed away on October 18. His bride, who is also a teacher, had been widowed before when she lost her first husband to cancer in the late nineties. When she learned of Smith's diagnosis, she took a leave of absence from her job to care for him. 'There is now such a hole,' Judy told Proctor last Sunday at church about her life without Smith. A man and his instrument: Paul Smith (before his diagnosis) began playing the trombone as a child . Smith . and Judy had met in 2004 when she chatted up the musician at the . Kendall United Methodist Church, where he attended and played trombone . for the church's brass ensemble. She asked Smith if he would be willing to teach her son, Wade Morgan Judy, how to play the trombone and a romance was soon born. The couple became engaged in 2007. They decided to marry despite Smith's cancer diagnosis at the Methodist church . where they met, in a ceremony filled with music. Members of the University of Miami Frost School of Music’s trombone choir performed for the marriage ceremony - as did the bride's son, showing off the fruit of Smith's tutelage over the years. To play the trombone and live with Smith was 'like having a lesson 24/7,’ Wade told the Miami Herald. 'He’d . hear something I was doing from the other end of the house and come in . and work with me for a few minutes. It was kind of neat to have that,' he said. Smith, a native of Lincoln, Nebraska, cultivated his love for music at a young age. 'Paul started piano in third grade,' his mother, Ann Marie Smith, said, adding that he started on the trombone in the fifth grade. 'There was never any doubt he was going to be in band.' He played in the band all during high school and went on to earn a music degree from DePaul University and a master's in music from the University of Victoria. He spent much of his career on the . road, touring with big band legends and performing on cruise ships. Settling in Florida in 1997, he joined the faculty program at the . high school - teaching marching band, symphonic band, concert band and . jazz band at the high school. 'Students were devastated by the news,' Robert Longfield, chairman of the performing Arts Department at Miami Palmetto Senior High School, told the MailOnline about Smith's death. 'He was a respected and loved member of the staff,' he continued, describing how there has been an outpouring of emotion in response to his death. 'Flowers have been placed by the band room door, notes of remembrance have been left on the wall, alumni have returned to pay their respect, it has brought everyone together,' he said, adding, 'He impacted the lives of so many students.' As an active member of the community, he played in the church orchestra and brass ensemble, an R&B cover band called Mystery Tones and he also served as a Boy Scout assistant troop leader. Smith is survived by his wife, son and mother, a brother David and a sister Caitlyn. His funeral will be held on Saturday at Kendall United Methodist Church, a sad departure from the previous celebration. The University of Miami Frost School of Music’s trombone choir, which had played for Smith's wedding this month, is expected to perform at his funeral.

The Taliban is targetting another Pakistani schoolgirl activist just two weeks after shooting Malala Yousafzai in the head in a botched assassination. Hina Khan, believed to be 16, this week found a red 'X' painted on the main gate of her family's Islamabad residence. After removing the graffiti, the red 'X' reappeared the next day and then her mother Farhat, a social worker, received a phone call from Pershawar warning that Hina is the Taliban's next target. Warning: The Taliban is targetting another Pakistani schoolgirl activist just two weeks after shooting Malala Yousafzai in the head. Hina Khan, 16, found a red 'X' painted on the gate of her family's Islamabad home . Outspoken: Hina with her parents at a press conference in 2009, criticising the Taliban after previous threats . Like Malala, who was shot on a school bus on October 9, Hina is known for her female rights activism and pro-education stance. She is also originally from the same Swat Valley area of Pakistan that was under complete Taliban control from 2007 to 2009. Hina and her family were forced to move to Islamabad in 2006 after publicly criticising atrocities committed by militants. She told Dawn.com: 'I had left Swat with my family because the militants had threatened girls' education there but now I feel I would not be able to go to school in Islamabad as well after these renewed threats. 'I am more worried now because after the attack on Malala, this red cross appearing on our door and subsequent threats to my family has made us more insecure.' Her father, Raitullah Khan, said: 'A . few days ago when I came out of my house I saw a red cross on my gate, . which I removed assuming it might have been drawn by some kids. 'But the very next day it appeared again which really terrified me. 'We . [then] received a call that Hina will be next after Malala. We have . already been fighting death threats for many years when my wife started . speaking for women rights and girls' education.' Hina first attracted the wrath of the . Taliban in 2008, when she held a press conference when militants . started bombing schools in a campaign of intolerance against girls . receiving an education. Her mother was already a target of the fundamentalist Islamic group after organising a handicraft show for Swati women in 2006. Care: Pakistani shooting victim Malala Yousufzai, who is recovering in Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham . Support: Campaigners gather for a vigil for Malala Yousafzai in Birmingham's Victoria Square last week . The latest threats have so affected . Mrs Khan that she now refuses to allow her children to go to school, . instead keeping them at home. Mr . Khan said: 'We are almost being held as hostages inside our house. I . want security for my three daughters, two sons and my wife so they can . live freely.' It today emerged that Al-Qaeda is furious that Malala, 15, is being hailed a heroine around the world. Would-be . killers were sent to shoot Malala because she has campaigned for . womens' rights and educating girls in the Swat Valley area of Pakistan . But . their attempt to re-assert power backfired - first by failing to kill . brave Malala, and then by sparking protests across Pakistan in support . of the schoolgirl. Sunni clerics in the country even issued a fatwa against the Taliban, decrying an attack on a girl as un-Islamic. Support is offered for Malala Yousafzai during a Harvard Square candlelit vigil in Cambridge, Massachusetts . Solidarity: Pakistani students hold pictures of 14-year-old schoolgirl Malala Yousufzai on Saturday . But Al-Qaeda member Ustad Ahmad Farooq compared the attack on Western military operations, saying in a letter: 'Nobody spoke up for thousands of such Malalas who became victims of military operations, and nobody protested for them on the roads,’ reported Fox News. He added: ‘But these circles made so much noise when we targeted this girl who made fun of jihad, the veil and other Islamic values on behest of the British Broadcasting Corporation. ‘This attack created shockwaves in the ruling circles around the world. They issued a number of statements condemning the attack on Malala. I may ask why? Why is Malala's blood more important than those killed by the army?’ Dr Dave Rosser, medical director at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, said Malala will need a significant period of rest and recuperation before she has reconstructive surgery. Malala, who cannot speak at the moment, was in a medically induced coma on arrival in Britain last Monday, but has since regained consciousness and has stood for the first time since the shooting. She was struck just above the back of her left eye, with the bullet travelling down the side of her jaw and damaging the skull. It went through her neck and lodged in the tissue above her shoulder blade. University Hospitals Birmingham today said Malala 'remains in a stable condition'.","Hina Khan found a red 'X' painted on the gate of her family's Islamabad home .

Trump was a guest on the Late Show With David Letterman, to further explain the offer - which turned out to be a $5million charity donation in exchange for Obama's old college and passport records. When asked by Letterman why he was orchestrating the demand, Trump replied: 'Transparency.' He added: 'There's too much we don't know about our president.' Scroll down for video . Playing to the audience: Donald Trump was offered the opportunity to explain his demand that President Obama show his college and passport records with David Letterman . When Letterman asked what kind of damning evidence would be revealed by college records, Trump said: 'A line saying place of birth' - an apparent indication that Trump still may not believe the president was born in the U.S., despite Obama’s release of his birth certificate last year. 'I hope everything [in Obama's records] is perfect - and it might be.' 'If it was negative - there wouldn't be an election.' On the subject of Obama’s birth certificate, Trump said that it took Obama six years to provide it, when ‘I could give it to you in less than an hour.' Sticking to his guns: Trump, seen outside the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City, is standing by his offer of $5million to the charity of President Obama's choice if he releases the records . Marketing: Trump also discussed his line of shirts and ties, all of which are made in Bangladesh and China, respectively . As the audience applauded, Trump raised his hands, relishing in the moment on the late night stage. But Letterman ordered the crowd to stop clapping, saying 'the breeze will disturb [Trump's] hair.' Moving along, Trump said that what he . likes most about Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is his . stance on China before showing off his shirt and tie line currently . being sold at Macy’s stores. But as Letterman quickly revealed, the ties were made in China. Hours earlier, Trump has received an counter-offer to his 'bordering-on-gigantic' news about the President. Trump had hyped his 'big reveal' for several days on major news outlets while incessantly tweeting about his 'game changer' information in the final weeks before the election. Political satirist Stephen Colbert has now ramped up the stakes for the Apprentice star by offering Trump a donation to a charity of his choice - with rather more x-rated consequences. Payback: Stephen Colbert (left) offered Donald Trump (right) $1million charity donation for an expletive act as a counter-offer to the $5million Trump told Obama he would donate to charity in exchange for his college records . On his Comedy Central show The Colbert Report, the sarcastic host told the audience: 'Mr Trump, I will write you a cheque to the charity of your choice for $1million.... if you will let me dip my balls in your mouth.' Colbert added: 'Nothing would make me happier than to write this cheque... and nothing would make America happier than something going into your mouth instead of coming out of it.' Trump had yet to respond to Colbert's offer which the comic set for '5pm on October 31' - the same deadline that Trump gave the President. Trump made his YouTube offer on Wednesday at noon,  promising . to donate $5million to a charity of the President's choice if he revealed the information. The tycoon denied his elaborate staging was a publicity stunt, insisting this was 'not a media . event', but instead is 'about the United States of America'. Colbert, who is left-leaning, was far from the only public figure to mock the billionaire businessman. Repeat guest: This was Mr Obama's fifth time on The Tonight Show; the president is in the middle of a campaign blitz . Broadcaster Barbara Walters scolded her 'friend' on The View today saying: 'Donald, you're not hurting Obama, you're hurting Donald, and that hurts me because you're a decent man.' Trump was characteristically unrepentant today, returning to Twitter to directly respond: '@BarbaraJWalters @theviewtv--Why did you choose me as one of the 10 Most Fascinating People of the Year last season (and more than once?)' The Internet exploded yesterday with mock responses to the Apprentice star's announcement. Comedian Andy Borowitz tweeted: 'Attention . parents: if you give your children even the tiniest bit of attention . now, maybe they won't grow up to be Donald Trump.' Observers on the right also slated Trump, who has publicly endorsed Republican Mitt Romney. Jim Geraghty of the conservative National Review, wrote: 'If at any point you seriously considered Donald Trump for president, please study the error of your ways in quiet, private contemplation.' However there was support for Trump's actions with those echoing his call for most transparency from the President including conservative talk show host Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter. Defence: Trump took to Twitter to claim that his announcement was public-spirited, not self-serving . There are a number of conspiracy . theories surrounding Obama's college records, the most popular being that he had poor grades and that he had attended college as a foreign exchange student. The latter ties into Trump's other argument, the so-called 'birther' conspiracy, that the President was born in Kenya and not Hawaii thus making him ineligible for the White House. Although a White House response was not expected, Obama addressed the matter directly when he appeared on the Jay Leno Show last night. Obama told the TV host that the rivalry between himself and Trump began in their childhood. ‘This all dates back to when we were growing up in Kenya,' he joked. 'We had constant run-ins on the soccer field, he wasn’t very good.’ It had been suggested that Trump's revelation was that he had unearthed divorce papers between the President and his wife Michelle. The claims about divorce papers have previously been made in a book released earlier this year by author Ed Klein. The White House rubbished the allegations then and claimed Klein had a history of making things up.

Busted: Michael R Mastro had been hiding out in the French Alps with his wife Linda for 16 months . A bankrupt Seattle real estate magnate and his wife have been arrested in France more than a year after allegedly skipping out on $250million in debts. Michael and Linda Mastro, age 87 and 63, were arrested on Wednesday at the idyllic Lake Annecy in the French Alps - where they had been hiding out after their $2billion real estate empire fell apart. The couple fled after refusing to hand over a pair of massive diamond rings Mrs Mastro owned. The rings were 27.8 carats and 15.9 carats and worth more than $1.4million combined. They were found in the small village of Doussard in eastern France near the Swiss border, where they had been renting a house under their own name for 16 months, the Seattle Times reports. U.S. authorities are currently working to extradite them back to Seattle. They face six counts of federal bankruptcy fraud as part of the biggest bankruptcy case in Washington state history. In 2009, Mr Mastro claimed $587million in debts and $250million in assets. That debt is estimated at $250million today. In the heyday of their real estate business, the Mastros lived on top of the world. The couple owned a Bentley convertible, a Rolls Royce, a Land Rover and a Mercedes-Benz. They vacationed in Italy, Switzerland, France, New York, and Palm Springs, Florida. They bought expensive works of art, including dozens of sculptures by renowned artist Dale Chihuly. When their real estate empire collapsed, federal authorities say, the couple tired to hide the assets from creditors, according to the Times. Wealthy: Mr Mastro's Bently convertible was among the luxury items auctions off in a feeble attempt to clear his $250million debts . Hanging on: This is one of the massive diamond rings that the Mastros refused to give up . They allegedly set up shell companies in Belize and the state of Delaware and transferred ownership of their home in California, as well as their cars and Mrs Mastro's expensive jewelry. Even after they filed bankruptcy, they continued to drive luxury cars and take lavish vacations to resorts all over the world, the Times reports. In June 2011, after a judge ordered them to turn over the lavish rings, they moved out of their expansive home in Palm Desert California and fled. Federal authorities say they missed the couple in Toronto, Canada, by just days. And then, for 16 months, they disappeared. In their absence, many of their belongings were sold at auction, in an effort to cover their debts. Among the estate was a Chihuly chandelier, a Steinway baby grand piano, 56 designer handbags. 65 pairs of high heels and a Bentley convertible. The total from that sale was $341,000. In January, a judge ordered $2.8million from the Mastro's assets to be distributed to creditors -- just one penny on the millions owed by the couple.

Scroll down for video . Jorge Negromonte,50, and his wife Isabel Pires,51, allegedly cooked their victims and turned them into pastries in a real-life version of the Sweeney Todd . Yesterday they appeared at court for the first time in their home town of Pernambuco, north-east Brazil, accused of murdering Jessica da Silva, Alexandra Falcao and Gisele da Silva, but did not enter pleas. However, police have previously said the alleged cannibals have confessed to killing another six unidentified people. The sickening allegations echo those of fictional barber Sweeney Todd in Victorian London. The murderous shop owner cut the throats of his victims before his accomplice Mrs Lovett baked their flesh into meat pies and sold them to unsuspecting customers of her shop. They allegedly killed 17-year-old Jessica da Silva in 2008, who was living with them along with her one-year-old daughter. Negromonte, left, is accused of murdering Alexandra Falcao, 20, right, whose body was buried in his garden . Jorge Negromonte pictured being led into court yesterday in Brazil where he appeared for the first time . Her innocent baby daughter was forced to eat pies made from her mother's flesh as part of a ‘purification ritual’, it has been claimed. Police caught the trio after one of the women tried to use the credit card belonging to a girl who had been reported missing near their house. They dug up the garden and found two bodies, believed to be local girls Alexandra Falcao, 20, and Gisele da Silva, 30. Both victims had reportedly been seen near the house just before they disappeared. But Negromonte's brother Irenaeus told the court that he was not capable of the crime because his brother is vegetarian. 'His vegetarianism means it would be a contradiction for him to eat human flesh,'he said. In . tears, Negromonte's other brother, Emanuel, said: 'As a child, Jorge . was a normal teenager and had friends. But by age 17, he designed comics . that had scenes of violence against women.' The alleged murders mimic those of fictional killer Sweeney Todd, famously played by Johnny Depp in the 2007 film remake . Murderer Sweeney Todd, pictured in the BBC 1 television series, turned his victims into pies . The alleged killers previously told police they were members of a sect called Cartel, which aimed to purify the world and reduce the population. After searching their house, police found a 50-page handwritten handbook with detailed writings and drawings on cannibalism. Five witnesses appeared in front of a judge at the court in Olinda, Pernambuco, to give evidence of the relationship between the three defendants. ‘These testimonies are to prove that Jorge Beltrao and Isabel Cristina were married, he had an affair with Bruna da Silva, who subsequently passed herself off as Jessica da Silva after killing her and keeping her daughter,’ prosecutor Eliane Gaia said, according to Brazilian reports. Lawyers for Negromonte reportedly filed a claim of insanity.","Jorge Negromonte, 50, his wife Isabel Pires, 51, and his mistress Bruna da Silva, 25, in court over three murders .

Tests for trainee teachers will be radically toughened up to boost the calibre of staff entering schools. A review ordered by Education Secretary Michael Gove found that existing English and maths tests taken by applicants are too easy, with many questions pitched merely at the level of grade D at GCSE. Changes to make the tests tougher will include a ban on using calculators in the maths test and a new writing exercise in English to assess vocabulary. Learning: Under new proposals, from next September, anyone who wants to train as a teacher will have to complete revamped tests in English and maths . All applicants for teacher training will be required to sit the tests, which will be raised to standards equivalent to grade B at GCSE within three years. Trainees will also have to sit a new reasoning test designed to assess their powers of logic and deduction. Verbal, numerical and abstract reasoning will be examined. Good marks in the tests may be linked to higher bursaries under proposals being considered by ministers. Top graduates currently qualify for training incentives of up to £20,000. Reports from Ofsted inspectors suggest some staff have a poor grasp of their subjects, leading to gaps in children’s knowledge. Yet 98 per cent of teacher trainees pass the current selection tests. About one in five need to resit at least once in order to pass. The review panel led by Sally Coates, principal of Burlington Danes Academy in West London, found some questions ‘are not sufficiently demanding, appearing to be in some cases below the level of GCSE grade C’. In maths, the emphasis was on ‘simple’ calculations. In English, assessment of key skills was excluded. Passing the numeracy test has been a requirement of Qualified Teacher Status since 2000, and literacy the following year. Until last month, trainees only sat the tests towards the end of their courses. The new changes will be phased in from next September, with the reasoning test introduced from 2014. Candidates will be limited to two resits. If they fail three times, they will be barred from applying for teacher training for two years. Expectations: David Laws said many children were led to believe top exam grades were beyond them . Liberal Democrat David Laws . said yesterday that too many children were led to believe that top exam . grades, places at elite universities and professional careers were . beyond them. Mr Laws added that even in relatively . affluent areas many young people saw a job with one of the big local . employers as the limit of their ambition. ‘Teachers, . colleges, careers advisers have a role and a responsibility to aim for . the stars and to encourage people to believe they can reach the top in . education and employment,’ Mr Laws said. ‘That’s not happening as much as it should.’ The comments by Mr Laws were his first remarks on education since his return to Government in last month’s reshuffle. He . quit as the Coalition’s Chief Secretary to the Treasury in May 2010 . after it was revealed he had been guilty of an expenses fiddle totalling . more than £50,000.

They have seen sales surge as busy workers look for a fast and healthy breakfast to grab on their way to the office. But starting the day with new-style breakfast biscuits could be no better for you than their eating an everyday cookie, research suggests. In fact, a typical serving of  Hobnobs contains less fat and fewer calories than their apparently healthy rivals. Perfect start? Breakfast biscuits and cereal bar sales have surged as people look for quick and healthy options . The breakfast snacks are marketed as wholesome yet convenient by food manufacturers including Belvita, McVitie’s and Kellogg’s. Belvita has seen an 85 per cent rise in sales this year. A typical serving of four of their muesli biscuits contains eight grammes of fat and 228 calories, but just two grammes of fibre, trade magazine The Grocer found. By contrast, eating two Hobnobs means you consume six grammes of fat and just 134 calories, as well as 1.6 grammes of fibre. Two Rich Tea biscuits contain a much lower two grammes of fat and just 76 calories. Healthy option? Belvita has seen an 85 per cent rise in sales this year . Other breakfast biscuits also fared poorly. McVitie’s Go Ahead Cherry Fruit Bake may have only three grammes of fat but contains 131 calories, roughly equivalent to two Hobnobs. Meanwhile, a Kellogg’s All-Bran Original Breakfast Biscuit has eight grammes of fat and 176 calories. It did better on fibre, containing six grammes. The Grocer magazine said: ‘Despite being positioned as a wholesome start to the day, breakfast biscuits contain more saturated  fat than biscuit favourites like digestives, Rich Tea and Hobnobs.’ Nutritionist Kate Cook added: ‘I can’t see any that would make me say, “That’s a good breakfast” ’. The criticism of breakfast bars comes as other research showed that ‘healthy’ yogurts can have a far higher sugar content than ice cream. A study produced for The Mail on Sunday by food manufacturer the Natural Ketosis Company found that low-fat mandarin yogurt made by Rowan Glen, which is sold in 125g pots – a typical serving size – has 17.6g of sugar per 100g. This compares with just 12.8g per 100g in Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream.  Traditional cereals have also been proven to be less healthy than is often claimed. Consumer group Which? has said many children’s cereals are so packed with sugar that they should  be put alongside chocolate biscuits on shop shelves. Breakfast-bar makers said the extra vitamins and  minerals in their products made them a better option than Hobnobs. Sanjeev Hanna, of Kellogg’s, said: ‘Unlike everyday biscuits, our breakfast biscuits contain six B vitamins, iron and calcium.’ Surprising research: Breakfast biscuits often contain more saturated fat than biscuit favourites, such as HobNobs and Rich Teas . Rahul Gursahani, of Belvita, said: ‘Our range contains up to 70 per cent cereals and 40 per cent wholegrain. ‘These complex carbohydrates break down more slowly to provide a regular and continuous release when eaten as part of a balanced breakfast.’ And Eamon Donnelly, of Dale Farm Ltd, which makes Rowan Glen products, said: ‘This is not a valid comparison because the sugar in this item is naturally occurring in both yogurt and fruit and the added sugar is natural. That is not the case for ice cream.’","Breakfast snacks are marketed as wholesome yet convenient by food manufacturers including Belvita, McVitie’s and Kellogg’s .

Reid said: . ‘It was good to see him and we had a bit of light-hearted banter and a . good laugh.

A New York programmer who sued Facebook claiming 50 . per cent of its ownership has been arrested in what's now being . called a multibillion-dollar scheme. Paul Ceglia, 39, was arrested on Friday at his Wellsville, New York home after federal prosecutors say he fabricated and destroyed evidence to falsely support his case against Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said Ceglia was seeking a 'quick payday based on a blatant forgery.' Busted: Paul Ceglia, who sued Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for half of his company, has been arrested on charges he forged records claiming his promised ownership . He was scheduled to appear in federal court in Buffalo on Friday afternoon. Prosecutors say Zuckerberg agreed in 2003 to perform programming work for Ceglia and his fax business when he was a Harvard University student. In Ceglia's lawsuit filed against Zuckerberg in early 2011, he claimed Zuckerberg promised him at least half of his future website in what would become Facebook as seen today. Ceglia presented a two-page contract and emails allegedly between both men which authorities say have been found falsified with the help of forensic examination in Ceglia’s hard drives and Harvard University’s email servers. Shady deal: Ceglia claimed that Zuckerberg had signed over half of his future company to him in 2003 while at Harvard University but the purported emails have been found fake by authorities . They say Ceglia falsified the first page of the contract and then attached a second that held both men's signatures, appearing to agree to the deal. With their signatures dated April 20 of 2003, however, authorities pointed out it predating Zuckerberg's claims of having come up with the idea for the social media site in the first place. 'The contract is a cut-and-paste job, the emails are complete fabrications and this entire lawsuit is a fraud,' attorneys for Mr Zuckerberg and his Palo Alto, California-based company wrote at the time of Ceglia's lawsuit. 'Zuckerberg has now declared under oath that he did not sign the contract attached to Ceglia's complaint and that he did not write or receive any of the purported emails,' they said. It was not immediately clear who will represent Ceglia in court. November 22, 2003 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia . 'I have recently met with a couple of upperclassmen here at Harvard that are planning to launch a site very similar to ours. If we don’t make a move soon, I think we will lose the advantage we would have if we release before them.'I’ve stalled them for the time being and with a break if you could send another $1000 for the facebook (sic) project it would allow me to pay my roommate or Jeff to help integrate the search code and get the site live before them. Please give me a call so that we can talk more about this.'January 1, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia . I think it is unnecessary at this point, with all of the extra work I have done for you, to be held to the original completion date. I should not be penalized for delays that were out of my control, namely that there have been so many unspecified requests from the Streetfax project that you wanted to be placed as a priority, thereby delaying my start on our second project.'Thus, I am requesting a written waiver on your part exempting me from the obligation to give you additional ownership in the project that is outlined in our original contract.'January 5 - Mr Ceglia to Mr Zuckerberg . 'It is well past January 1 and to my knowledge you don't have a single thing done for the site... You know perfectly well that you can't just take a person's investment and then spend it on women and beer or whatever you do up there in Harvard.'I've been stalled long enough on this thing and if I don't see something soon I'll no choice but to contact the school and perhaps your parents in Dobbs Ferry and let them know what's going on.'February 2, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia . 'Paul, I have a rather serious issue to discuss with you, according to our contract I owe you over 30% more of the business in late penalties which would give you over 80% of the company.'First I want to say that I think that is completely unfair because I did so much extra work for you on your site that caused those delays in the first place and second I don’t even think it is legal to charge such a huge penalty.'Mostly though I just won’t even bother putting the site live if you are going to insist on such a large percentage. I’d like to suggest that you drop the penalty completely and that we officially return to 50/50 ownership.'February 6, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia . 'Sorry it’s taken me a few days to respond, (sic) Now that the sites (sic) live I feel I must take creative control and I just can not risk injuring my sites (sic) reputation by cheapening it with your idea of selling college junk, nor do I wish to spend my time shipping out coffee mugs to rich alumni. The site is cool as it is and I don’t care about making any money on it right now, I just want to see if people will use it.'February 7, 2004 - Mr Ceglia to Mr Zuckerberg . 'Mark, all I can think is your parents have handed you everything your entire life and after all this time and energy and MONEY that you think in your head that an ok way to act is to just say - oh I’ve changed my mind I don’t think it’s cool to make money and that that should be that.'April 6, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia'Paul, I have become too busy to deal with the site and no one wants to pay for it, so I am thinking of just taking the server down. My parents have a fund that I can tap into for my college expenses and I would just like to give you your two thousand dollars back and call it even on the rest of the money you owe me for the extra work. At this point I won’t even really be able to work on the facebook until Summer.'April 6, 2004 - Mr Ceglia to Mr Zuckerberg . 'Grow up, take a f***ing ethics class, choke yourself with that silver spoon of yours.'July 22, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia (A week before the company was incorporated) 'Paul, I am guessing that you don’t want to talk to me but I wanted to say happy birthday and that I hope to resolve our differences. I see that what I did was wrong and I am really sorry that I behaved as I did. Please give me your address and I will mail you back the $2000 for your trouble, more if it will repair our business relationship.'Another summer is here and I still don’t have any time to build our site, I understand that I promised I would, but other things have come up and I am out in California working during break.

Public health crises of the past decade — . such as the 2003 SARS outbreak, which spread to 37 countries and caused . about 1,000 deaths, and the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic that killed about . 300,000 people worldwide — have provided girim reminders hat new viruses or . bacteria could spread quickly across the globe, aided by air travel. The MIT study used mathematical modelling to predict which airports would play the largest role in spreading disease. Small airports such as Honolulu can play a disproportionately large part - others Los Angeles, Honolulu, San Francisco, Newark, Chicago (O'Hare) and Washington (Dulles). ‘Our work is the first to look at the . spatial spreading of contagion processes at early times, and to propose . a predictor for which 'nodes' — in this case, airports — will lead to . more aggressive spatial spreading,’ says Ruben Juanes, the ARCO . Associate Professor in Energy Studies in CEE. ‘The findings could form the basis . for an initial evaluation of vaccine allocation strategies in the event . of an outbreak, and could inform national security agencies of the most . vulnerable pathways for biological attacks in a densely connected . world.’ Spreading the sickness: Police officers wear masks at Cairo airport, as a precautionary measure against influenza A (H1N1), commonly referred to as swine flu in 2009 . 1.New Yorks JFK . 2 Los Angeles, LAX . 3. Honolulu . 4. San Francisco . 5. Newark, Chicago (O'Hare) But a new study by researchers in MIT's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) shifts the focus to the first few days of an epidemic, determining how likely the 40 largest U.S. airports are to influence the spread of a contagious disease originating in their home cities. This new approach could help determine appropriate measures for containing infection in specific geographic areas and aid public health officials in making decisions about the distribution of vaccinations or treatments in the earliest days of contagion.Unlike existing models, the new MIT model incorporates variations in travel patterns among individuals, the geographic locations of airports, the disparity in interactions among airports, and waiting times at individual airports to create a tool that could be used to predict where and how fast a disease might spread. Existing models typically assume a random, homogenous diffusion of travelers from one airport to the next.However, people don't travel randomly; they tend to create patterns that can be replicated. Using González's work on human mobility patterns, Juanes and his research group — including graduate student Christos Nicolaides and research associate Luis Cueto-Felgueroso — applied Monte Carlo simulations to determine the likelihood of any single traveler flying from one airport to another. Spreaders of disease: The new study looked at which of 40 U.S. home airports would have the worst impact on spreading disease . ‘The results from our model are very different from those of a conventional model that relies on the random diffusion of travelers … [and] similar to the advective flow of fluids,’ says Nicolaides, first author of a paper by the four MIT researchers that was published in the journal PLoS ONE. ‘The advective transport process relies on distinctive properties of the substance that's moving, as opposed to diffusion, which assumes a random flow. If you include diffusion only in the model, the biggest airport hubs in terms of traffic would be the most influential spreaders of disease. But that's not accurate.’For example, a simplified model using random diffusion might say that half the travelers at the Honolulu airport will go to San Francisco and half to Anchorage, Alaska, taking the disease and spreading it to travelers at those airports, who would randomly travel and continue the contagion.In fact, while the Honolulu airport gets only 30 percent as much air traffic as New York's Kennedy International Airport, the new model predicts that it is nearly as influential in terms of contagion, because of where it fits in the air transportation network: . Its location in the Pacific Ocean and its many connections to distant, large and well-connected hubs gives it a ranking of third in terms of contagion-spreading influence.","New York's JFK ranks first out of 40 U.S. airports .

A footballer urinated in front of visiting fans before his debut appearance for Bristol Rovers' first team, it has been alleged. Jordan Goddard, brought on as a substitute in the 93rd minute of the game, was reported to police by a Corby Town supporter for relieving himself as he warmed up at the side of the pitch. The incident was said to have taken place on a corner flag at the Corby end of Bristol's Memorial Stadium. It allegedly happened just ahead of half-time in front of 500 fans during an FA Cup tie that Bristol won 3-1. James Crawford, 48, was watching the match with his 12-year-old son. He told the Sun: 'I've never seen anything like it. He was doing stretches, then put his hands in his shorts and pulled himself out.' Fans jeered Goddard for his actions but rather than being embarrassed, the 18-year-old midfielder looked back and laughed. An Avon and Somerset Police spokesman said: 'We are aware of it and we are looking into it in liaison with the football club.' A spokesman from Bristol Rovers added: 'This is subject to a club investigation and will be dealt with internally.' Goddard's alleged urination took place just before half-time at Bristol Rovers' Memorial Stadium . Former Argentinian goalkeeper Sergio Goycochea was well-known for his pre-penalty shoot-out ritual. In a bid to try and calm himself he would urinate on the pitch. He . explained: 'Until a match finishes you cannot leave the field of play. And if you have any natural human urges, you have to go on the field. 'So . that is what happened in the 1990 World Cup quarter final against . Yugoslavia. I went and we won. 'There . was another shoot out in the semi final against Italy so I went again . and we won again. It was my lucky charm and I went before every shoot . out. I was very subtle, nobody complained.' In April this year, Cheltenham Association Football League promised a clampdown on footballers urinating at the side of the pitch. However, manager Martin Gulliver said there was a simple explanation and that the players were 'responsible blokes' who, rather than peeing in the bushes were searching for a lost ball. Managers from the league, however, issued a reminder to clubs that footballers shouldn't urinate in public. In October, referees officiating matches in the league were urged to red card players caught in the act.",Bristol Rovers player Jordan Goddard was seen by Corby Town fans relieving himself as he warmed up .

'Sapper' Clive Smith, who lost his legs in an explosion in Afghanistan, has become the face of The Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal . Sprawled on the dusty Afghan battlefield, he was minutes from bleeding to death after he was blown up by an IED. Hero soldier Clive Smith had suffered the appalling injuries while undertaking one of the most dangerous tasks in the Army - searching for buried bombs at the front of a patrol. But he missed one planted device which was cunningly made with a low metal content to reduce the chance of detection - costing him both legs. His life was saved only by the quick action of his comrades who helped stem the catastrophic blood loss before evacuating him from the battlefield. Now Sapper Smith, 27, is facing two huge challenges: learning to walk again and helping raise millions of pounds for the Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal. Two years after he was nearly killed, Sapper Smith, who served with 33 Engineer Regiment, is the face of the charity's £42million fundraising drive for 2012. He hopes his story will inspire members of the public to dig deep and beat the record £40million the RBL raised last year. Sapper Smith, of Cannock, Staffordshire, was fulfilling his dream when he joined the Army shortly after leaving school. Part of the Counter-IED Task Force, he was the lead man of a search patrol looking for IEDs designed to murder and maim troops and civilians. Operating in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand, he walked in front of the patrol, sweeping the ground with his Vallon detecting machine in a bid to locate roadside bombs. It is such a treacherous role because if a lead man misses a device, he is likely to be the one to trigger it. On October 13, 2010, during his second tour of duty, the unthinkable happened. Using a soldier's notoriously black humour, Sapper Smith said: 'I found one using an unconventional method - I stood on it. 'After the initial contact I was thrown through the air and there was a lot of dust and noise, and it took a while to settle. 'After about 30 seconds I was shouting to the rest of the lads, ""Who's hurt?"" and they turned round and said, ""You are"". I didn't realise straight away.' Unbowed: Clive undergoing gruelling physiotherapy at Headley Court in Surrey. Fitness is key to rehabilitation . Remembrance: He is currently using shorter prosthetic legs to train for a full-sized pair woth £30,000 . Sapper Smith had lost both legs above the knee. Disregarding their own safety, his colleagues dashed to give him medical treatment - applying tourniquets to his damaged legs to stop the bleeding. 'They saved my life,' he said. 'If they hadn't done what they did, I wouldn't be here.' The soldier was evacuated from the battlefield, treated at the state-of-the-art British field hospital at Camp Bastion, and flown back to the military wing of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. Five weeks later, Sapper Smith was beginning the gruelling recovery process that will see him walk again. He has spent the last two years in and out of Headley Court, the rehabilitation centre in Surrey, where he is treated by leading prosthetic experts and physios to make sure he regains the strength to walk unaided. Currently, he is using 'stubbies' - short prosthetic limbs that teach soldiers to walk on false legs. But he is progressing on to his £30,000 C-legs, which are made by the German company Ottobock for above-the-knee amputees. 'It's all about strength and fitness,' he said. 'The stronger you are, the fitter you are.' Before the explosion: Sapper Smith was on his second tour of duty when he was horrifically injured in the blast . Sapper Smith became involved with the Royal British Legion after attending its £30million Battle Back Centre, which provides sports and adventure activities to help wounded and sick service personnel recover. Based at Lilleshall in Staffordshire, it offers injured troops a range of activities including rock-climbing, swimming, kayak canoeing and wheelchair basketball to boost their confidence and fitness. 'It was daunting at first,' said Sapper Smith, 'but people in the military love a challenge and to be pushed out of their comfort zone and that's exactly what it did. 'It shows you that just because you're injured, there are still things you can go and do which is a massive bonus. It has given me a positive outlook which has really helped in all parts of my life.' The soldier said it was a 'great honour' to front the Poppy Appeal campaign. 'If it wasn't for the British public being so generous and funding places like the Battle Back Centre, injured soldiers and their families would find it more difficult to get their lives back on track.' Forward: The Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal hopes to beat the £40million it raised last year . The Legion has secured the support of pop stars Alesha Dixon and Pixie Lott to launch the 92nd Poppy Appeal. They will unveil a major campaign for the Armed Forces, their families and veterans: 'Standing shoulder to shoulder with Armed Forces families.' The Legion offers flexible and wide-ranging support to all generations of the Armed Forces and their families, including emergency grants, debt advice, employment and training support, assistance through tribunals and inquests, as well as care homes and family breaks.","Sapper Clive Smith lost both legs to a bomb in Afghanistan .

'Well, what -- no, I think it's -- I think it's good, because it's so clear that we're programmed and we're born to love and help each other, not to kill each other, to destroy each other,' he says.

Lord Coe is set to scoop a multi-million pound windfall from selling his private business to an advertising company that played a major role in the Olympics. The former Olympic gold medallist and head of the organising committee for the 2012 Games could stand to gain almost £12million over the next four years from the sale of his management consultancy firm, the Complete Leisure Group Limited. The buyer, Chime Communications, is an advertising and public relations group founded by Margaret Thatcher’s former spin master and 1980s PR mogul Lord Bell. The agency raked in more than £30million from a number of contracts during the Olympic Games. Given that former MP Lord Coe owns more than 90 per cent of the shares in the group, he will walk away with millions. Foreign Secretary William Hague is also set to benefit financially, as he is a minority shareholder in the venture. The . pair have a long history together, and Lord Coe, 56, was Mr Hague’s . chief bag carrier when he was leader of the Conservative Party between . 1997 and 2001. Chime will . pay just under  £2million this year for the company,  then additional . sums of more  than £2million over the next four  or five years. In a recent update to investors, Chime boasted about the responsibilities that it had taken on in the run-up to London 2012. These . included ‘managing the attendance of 40,000 guests through hospitality . programmes including event hospitality for 12 sponsors and 13,000 VIPs’ and the ‘design of the Olympic  pictograms and creation of the UK . School Games and Paralympic World Cup’. The group also told how it ‘created . and built sponsor facilities for EDF, BP and Olympic Club for the . International Organising Committee’. It added that it was involved in ‘securing commercial partners, drawing up key legacy plans and providing the Bid’s Vice President, Alan Pascoe’. Other roles included offering consultancy work to major sponsors including drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline, telecoms group BT, oil firm BP and security provider G4S. The Complete Leisure Group, or CLG, was founded in 2005 but the last time it submitted a full set of accounts was in 2008, when it reported losing almost £50,000 before tax. This was despite  turning over more than £470,000  of revenues. Lord Coe poses outside the Olympic Stadium in the Olympic Park in Stratford, London . Lord Sebastian Coe, chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games, shows the Queen around the Aquatics Centre on day one of London 2012 .

In that year it had  only seven members of staff,  but incurred wage costs of £651,592 - the equivalent of an average  salary for each employee of more than £93,000. A spokesman for Lord Coe insisted that Chime had been awarded no contracts directly by London 2012 organisers Locog, and had worked only for sponsor companies of the Games.

"By . Steve Doughty . Created 11:53 AM on 8th November 2011 . In a landmark ruling, the Roman Catholic Church faces having to pay millions to sex abuse victims after the court ruled it could be liable for priests' crimes. The woman claims she was assaulted by Father Wilfred Baldwin during two years at The Firs, in . Waterlooville, Hampshire, which has now closed, after being sent there . with her three siblings. She . said the priest would sexually assault her as ‘punishment’ for misbehaviour, . adding: ‘The nuns knew. He was allowed to take any child and rape them. It was always my fault. He would even make me give money afterwards, . tuppence in the poor box. He said God had told him to do it.’ Ruling: The decision by the High Court could have far-reaching implications for the church. It is subject to appeal . The woman known as JGE  was at the Firs children's home for two years from age six to eight between May 1970 and May 1972. The following are among the claims she has made: . JGE, . as she was referred to in court, never spoke of what happened until she . was contacted by police investigating abuse allegations at the home. ‘I didn’t tell anyone,’ she said, ‘even one of my siblings who I found out later had also been sexually assaulted.’ In . the landmark ruling, Mr Justice MacDuff said the Church can be held . responsible for the sins of its clergy because of the ‘immense power’ it . gave them. His judgment could lead to thousands of claims by people in England and Wales who say they were sexually abused by priests, perhaps decades earlier. It also means the Church may be held to account for other criminal acts by priests. In the test case yesterday, Mr Justice MacDuff found that the behaviour of Father Baldwin, who died in 2006. was the Church’s responsibility. The decision means the victim can sue the Bishop of Portsmouth, Crispian Hollis. The Church told the court it should not be answerable for wrongdoing by Father Baldwin because it did not employ him. Lawyers for the Portsmouth Roman Catholic Diocesan Trust, led by Lord Faulks QC, said priests were not paid by the diocese, nor could they be disciplined or sacked by the bishop. They lived on money from the collection plate and a priest could not even be made to change his job without  agreeing. But Mr Justice MacDuff said: ‘Father Baldwin was appointed by and on behalf of the defendants. ‘He was provided with the premises, the pulpit and the clerical robes. 'He was directed into the community with that full authority and was given free rein to act as a representative of the Church. 'He had been trained and ordained for that purpose. He had immense power handed to him by the defendants. 'It was their empowerment of the priest which materially increased the risk of sexual assault, the granting of the power to exploit and misuse the trust which the defendants had granted to him.’ The diocese refused to comment but is expected to appeal. Anne Lawrence, of the victim support group Minister and Clergy Sexual Abuse Survivors, said she was relieved by the ruling, adding: ‘We hope it opens the way for the settlement of many hundreds of cases pending in courts.’ The Church has been trying for a decade to end scandals over sexual abuse by priests, and is set to publish a report today on abuse at a school in Ealing, West London.","Case could have wide-reaching implications for alleged church child abuse victims .

Tabby Shaw, 40, tipped the scales at 20 stone but when her partner John was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes she decided to tackle her life-long weight problem. In a bid to avoid developing the same condition as her husband, which is often linked to obesity, Tabby met with a dieting consultant and started following a strict meal plan. Tabby Shaw, 40, tipped the scales at 20st but after six months of dieting the mother-of two weighs 9st . Now six months on, without the help of a gastric band or weight loss surgery, Tabby has discovered a new lease of life. Weighing just nine stone and now a slim size 12, the office worker from Redditch, Worcestershire,  is barely recognisable. Delighted with her svelte figure she said: 'I was always a big girl. I was larger than my school friends and then an even larger adult. 'But now I’ll walk past a mirror and . I’ll have to stop and check it’s really me. Tabby used to gorge in secret, snacking on cakes and biscuits, and indulged in giant portions three times a day . By the age of ten Tabby was ten stone and after having two children she was 20st 9lb (left) but today she is a lot happier and is determined to stick to a healthier lifestyle . 'When you’ve always been as . big as I have being slim takes some getting used to. 'I’ve also found that men find me . much more attractive which is a revelation. I’ve never felt so good or had so much energy.' Tabby had always battled with her body image. Aged ten she weighed ten stone and after having two children she was 20st 9lb. She gorged in secret, snacking on cakes and biscuits, while indulging in giant portions three times a day. Cruel jeers from strangers only added to her feelings of self-loathing. But after John's diagnosis, and not wanting her two daughters Mary, 17, . and Ester ,15, to be burdened with two seriously ill parents she decided . to turn her life around. She said: 'My husband John was diagnosed with diabetes when he was 40 and by the time I reached 39 I knew there was a real possibility that I could develop it too. 'I didn’t want my kids to have two parents with a life limiting disease so last year I decided that I was going to do something about it. 'I had a meeting with a dieting consultant on New Year’s Eve and made it my New Year’s resolution to lose the weight.' After reaching her ideal weight in December, Tabby remains determined to maintain a healthier lifestyle. 'I used make massive roasts for the family every Sunday. I’d make enough for ten at least, even though there was only four of us. 'When I was dieting I’d still make the roasts but I was only allowed a plate of vegetables and if were having chicken I was allowed a tiny bit of meat.' Tabby lost weight on the Cambridge Diet Plan, on which she ate two liquid meals a day and one small evening meal. It is considered by some medical experts as an extreme weight loss solution, as it can cause the body to burn muscle mass as well as fat. Tabby added: 'I never thought I’d be able to lose this much weight naturally, but I managed it. My message is that you don’t need to resort to drastic measures to lose weight, if I can do it anyone can.' Diabetes is a long-term condition caused by too much glucose in the blood and affects an estimated 2.8 million people in the UK.","Tabby Shaw gets fit after husband is diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes .

'Our . analysis shows that community-level disparities in 2007 cover a range . of global health experiences - from counties with life expectancies . better than the best-performing nations to those lagging behind these . nations by 50 or more years. 'The extent of geographic inequality is substantially larger in the US than in the UK, Canada, or Japan. 'Equally . concerning is that between 2000 and 2007, more than 85 per cent of . American counties have fallen further behind the international life . expectancy frontier, of which 55 per cent were statistically significant . at the 90 per cent confidence level. 'While the US and most of its communities fell further behind, the US maintained its position as the country that spent the most per capita on health care throughout this period.' The map to the left shows those with higher life expectancy while the map to the right shows how far behind the international average counties have fallen . Where people live in the U.S. has a significant impact on how long people can expect to live with some places being 16 years ahead of the average compared with others being 47 years behind. The figures come from a study by the University of Washington in Seattle and Imperial College, London. They questioned the effects of smoking, hypertension, diabetes, physical inactivity, obesity, cholesterol, diet and alcohol. The report said: 'At the national level, these risk factors together lead to close to one million premature deaths. 'If the leading four risk factors were addressed (smoking, high blood pressure, elevated blood glucose, and adiposity[obesity]), life expectancy in 2005 would increase 4.9 and 4.1 years, respectively, for males and females.' Obesity and smoking are among the reasons why Americans have a lower life expectancy than other Western nations . The study on average ages across the world comes on the back of a study by the OECD which looked at past and projected obesity rates. The findings are similar and show America's rising overweight population as being bigger than other countries, followed by England, Canada, and Australia respectively. One suggestion for addressing the problem is to distribute wealth more evenly. Human geography Professor Danny Dorling, from the University of Sheffield, said: 'Top income groups are badly affected because their doctors are not necessarily mainly interested in their health but work for organisations that have to make an income. 'I am not suggesting it is deliberate but you make more money out of a patient who spends more on many drugs and investigatory operations than one who lives longer with less intervention,' he told the BBC. Link? The U.S has more obese and overweight people than any other country . As the age gap widens between America and the rest of the world, the U.S. continues to get fatter . 'In a more equal system the rich who are well get less intervention - and they live longer in the UK than the U.S.' Researchers carried out a similar study in 2007 and both men and women came out 37th in the world with a range between different counties of more than 15 years. They found then and now that people in the Deep South, particularly around northern Texas, had the lowest life expectancy in stark contrast to countries along the Eastern Seaboard. There are also clusters of people living longer in Colorado, Minnesota, Utah, California, Washington, and Florida. Just 0.2 per cent of the population of Britain and two per cent of Canadians have life expectancies are more than 30 years behind the international average compared to 17 per cent of US counties for men.","Men in the U.S. can expect to live to 75 while Japanese men are pushing 80 .

Fighting for life: Ryan Hooley fractured his skull in five places when he fell between floors at the discount clothes chain's Nottingham store at around 2pm yesterday . A six-year-old boy is fighting for his life in hospital after plunging 35 feet from an escalator while shopping at Primark. Ryan Hooley . fractured his skull in five places yesterday when he fell between floors at the discount clothes chain's Nottingham store during the busy lunchtime rush. The youngster, from the city's Beeston area, was rushed by paramedics to Queens's Medical Centre after the accident where doctors have placed him in an induced coma. Nottinghamshire Police said the the city's council has launched an investigation into the accident alongside The Health and Safety Executive. A spokesman for the Queens's Medical Centre, in Nottingham, described Ryan's state as critical but stable. Ryan's parents Kate and Andrew, who were at his bedside today, told how a routine shopping trip turned to a 'nightmare'. Ryan Hooley's parents, Kate and Andrew Hooley, are keeping a vigil at their son's bedside at Nottingham's Queens Medical Centre. Kate said: 'It was a nice day out with the kids, I took them shopping, and was going to get something for dinner when I took a detour through Primark. 'He was there one second, and gone the next. It's your worst nightmare come true.' Andrew said: 'I think there could definitely be better safety especially for the rails up on the first floor. 'They could be a lot higher than they are at the minute, a lot, lot higher, and a lot safer.' The boy's uncle said: '[Kate and Andrew] were originally told by doctors to expect the worst. Ryan's condition is extremely serious and doctors have induced a coma. 'He's suffered five fractures to his skull. We are expecting to hear more in the next few hours' The uncle, who did not want to be named but has spent nine years in the army, added: 'It's perhaps surprising Ryan hasn't suffered more broken bones, I have worked at height before and known people die falling less distance. 'It's thought perhaps Ryan landed on clothes racks in the store which may have soften his fall instead of him going straight onto a hard floor.' Heart-stopping: Police at Primark's Nottingham store where shoppers watched in horror as Ryan fell over the escalator onto a clothes rail 35-feet below . His uncle said police had been in . touch with Andrew and doctors had told him Ryan could be taken out of . the coma within 24 to 48 hours. He said: 'I have been to that Primark . store and rode the escalators as an adult, but obviously not as a . child. I know there will be CCTV in the store and we are just trying to . work out what happened to Ryan. A woman, who did not want to be . named, said: 'I saw him fall from one floor to another and he landed on . some clothes rails. It was awful.' Another shopper said: 'I could clearly see one woman sat on the floor, screaming and crying.' An ambulance service spokesman said the boy was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre with head injuries. A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark's Nottingham store closed early following an incident in the store. 'The safety of our customers in our . stores is of paramount concern to us. We are now working with the . relevant authorities to investigate this incident.' A . Nottingham City Council spokesman said: 'We have been notified of an . accident at Primark and, as health and safety in retail premises is . overseen by councils, our health and safety officers are investigating . the circumstances. We are unable to say anything further at this stage.' Serious condition: A spokesman for the Queens's Medical Centre, in Nottingham, where Ryan is being cared for, described Ryan's state as critical but stable . This was not the first time a child has been injured falling from an escalator in Primark. In 2008, three-year-old Elsie Parry fell 100 feet after she reached the second floor of the Primark shop in Liverpool. The little girl is thought to have slipped though a gap in a 'glass wall' at the top of the department store escalator, plummeting to the basement floor as horrified shoppers looked on. She suffered a number of injuries including a broken arm and leg, a ruptured spleen and liver, fractured ribs, a cracked skull and a brain haemorrhage. Since the accident she has made a full recovery and returned, but not before she learned to walk again.","Ryan Hooley .

A police officer investigating a hit-and-run was shot dead by a gunman who then murdered an innocent motorist in an attempted car-jacking. A police manhunt led them to suspect Darrell Fuller, 33, who had bullet wounds to his neck and shoulder when officers found him. They are believed to have been self-inflicted. He was arrested over Tuesday morning's double murder and taken to Jamaica Hospital under police guard. Suspect and victim: Darrell Fuller, left, was arrested for allegedly shooting to death 29-year-old officer Arthur Lopez, right, during a traffic stop, and then gunning down a motorist during a carjacking . Fuller allegedly shot Lopez, 29, during a traffic stop after fleeing a hit-and-run accident, NBC4 reported. Lopez ‘lost his life to a cold-blooded killer,’ Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano said at a news conference. The death came less than a week after another Nassau County officer was killed while responding to a traffic accident. Lopez was on patrol in Bellerose Terrace, a community at the border of New York City's Queens borough and Nassau County. The officer and his partner spotted a damaged silver Honda that was ‘running on rims’ and fit the description of a car that had left a hit-and-run, authorities said. The officers gave chase, and the car pulled over. Following a brief conversation between Lopez and the driver, the man got out of the vehicle and fired one round into Lopez's chest, Police Chief Steven Skrynecki said. The officer was not wearing a bulletproof vest at the time. His partner was not injured. Lopez was rushed to North Shore-LIJ Medical Center where he was pronounced dead. Crime scene: Shooting victim, center, lies on the Cross Island Parkway as police investigate . Crime scene: Police officers investigate at the scene of a shooting in Bellerose Terrace where officer Lopez was gunned down during a traffic stop . Manhunt ends: Fuller was found outside a parked car in Queens with a gunshot wound to the shoulder . The gunman got back into his car and drove away, and then accosted the second victim, identified by CBS New York as 52-year-old Raymond Facey, of Brooklyn, authorities said. He shot the man in the head, dragged him out of his car and left him dead on the roadway as he drove away, they said. According to DNAInfo.com, Facey, a father of four, pulled over on the Cross Island Expressway and was on the phone with his daughter Dahlia, discussing plans to go on a vacation to Jamaica, when he was gunned down. His car was later found abandoned in a residential neighborhood in Queens. The slayings touched off a massive manhunt that included heavily armed New York Police Department officers going door-to-door in Queens. Authorities also closed the Cross Island Parkway for several hours, causing traffic delays. A man who witnessed the officer's shooting as he was stopped at a gas station along the highway said it looked like a routine traffic stop. Criminal past: Fuller was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to an attempted murder charge stemming from a 2004 incident . ‘The officer's walking up to the car. They just pulled out (a gun) and shot,’ said Paul Walcott, a music producer from the Queens neighborhood of Bayside. ‘He went right down. He got hit point blank. He went straight down.’ The car then sped off, heading south on the Cross Island Parkway, a north-south highway along the border of Queens and Nassau County. ‘In broad daylight, this time of day, it was incredible to see something like that,’ Walcott said. The shooting unfolded within blocks of Belmont Park, the racetrack where the Belmont Stakes is held. Highway patrolman Joseph Olivieri was killed Thursday while responding to a traffic accident caused by an alleged drunken driver. The driver, who was later charged with driving while intoxicated, smashed into one car, then drove on a short distance before stopping. A car then hit that driver's vehicle, turning it sideways in the road. The police officer who arrived to investigate was then struck by an SUV that happened upon the crash scene. Thousands of police officers attended a funeral Monday for Olivieri outside a Long Island church. Lopez joined the police force in 2004 and was also a volunteer firefighter and an EMT. He is survived by his father, mother and sister. Evidence: Forensic officers photograph a gun found at the scene . Crime scene: Officers tape off the area before searching for clues . Fallen colleague: Officers investigate the murder of fellow policeman Arthur Lopez . Nassau County PBA President James Carter described him as ‘full of life, full of energy, a great cop and a great friend.’ Fuller has two prior arrests, including one in October 2004 for attempted murder and another in March 2010 for possession of cocaine, according to law enforcement sources. He was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to the attempted murder charge and is currently on parole, sources said. Originally from Queens, Lopez move to a one-story ranch-style home in Babylon four years ago. Neighbors told the New York Post they are devastated by Lopez's tragic death. Many have described him as a friendly and nice guy who loved going to the gym and had recently bought a boat he called the Saltshaker.

Jerry Sandusky became a state prison inmate Tuesday with his transfer out of the Centre County jail, his makeshift home since he was convicted in June of child molestation. The 68-year-old former Penn State assistant coach arrived early in the morning at the State Correctional Institute at Camp Hill, just outside Harrisburg. He faces testing and evaluation that will take a week or more before he can be assigned a security risk level and sent to one of the state facilities as his 'home' prison. Appeal: Jerry Sandusky has launched an attempt to overturn his prison sentence of up to 60 years . At Camp Hill, experts will assess his mental state, physical health and education level, and determine whether he needs treatment. Sandusky was sentenced this month to 30 to 60 years for sexual abuse of 10 boys over a 15-year period. That hasn't stopped him from repeatedly asserted his innocence and last week filed post-sentencing motions, seeking to have convictions thrown out or a new trial. There are about 6,800 sex offenders serving time in Pennsylvania's prison system. Lockup: Sandusky has been at the Centre County Correctional Facility since he was convicted of 45 out of 48 counts of child abuse . Shame: The Penn State scandal brought down legendary head coach Joe Paterno, right, who has since died . The Corrections Department does not maintain special units for sex offenders, and there is no way to predict where he will be sent. Age is not a factor in the placement of Sandusky, 68, but any medical conditions could be. Inmates from 18 to 79 are housed in general populations, although older inmates may be put in lower bunks and have other handicap accommodations. The majority of state facilities have infirmaries. Benefits? Jerry Sandusky may be able to continue collecting his pension while behind bars . Camp Hill, in central Pennsylvania, has 3,000 to 4,000 inmates, about 1,000 of whom are held temporarily for classification. From there, he would then be placed in a state prison based on his treatment plan and the available beds. Sex offenders must undergo mandatory treatment programs, said Department of Corrections spokeswoman Sue Bensinger. Predictably, Sandusky was met with a cold welcome in the last state facility where he stayed since the trial. Inmates locked up alongside Jerry Sandusky reportedly taunted him by singing 'Hey, teacher, leave those kids alone' - a line from Pink Floyd's Another Brick in the Wall. 'At night, we were singing ""Hey, teacher, leave those kids alone"",' one 22-year-old offender named Josh told The Daily. Prisoners were banned from speaking directly to Sandusky, who was in a special unit reserved for sex offenders or people with mental illnesses. They were aware of his offenses as they had access to television and newspapers, Josh added. It suggests the hostile welcome Sandusky could have expected when he returned to the jail last week as he awaits sentencing.","Child molester Jerry Sandusky had been in county jail since his trial .

"By . Deborah Arthurs . UPDATED: . 12:22 EST, 20 February 2012 . A major outdoor clothing brand has been using down from force-fed geese to fill its quilted winter jackets, it has emerged. The North Face, an American company whose outdoor clothing is worn by the likes of Barack Obama, Angelina Jolie, Sharon Stone and Elle Macpherson as well by numerous BBC reporters, has been found to use down from Hungarian geese farmed for foie gras. Despite the company assuring customers in the past that the down used in their jackets would never come from a force-fed goose, animal rights campaigners found that the down came from Hungarian farms where geese are fattened using the force-feeding method to make foie gras from their bloated livers. Fans: Elle Macpherson, President Obama and . Angelina Jolie are brand supporters - but how will they react to the . news that The North Face uses down from force-fed geese? The technique used to artificially fatten the geese means that for three weeks, the birds have a metal funnel inserted into their throats down which grain is poured, far in excess of the quantity a goose would normally consume. As a result, their livers swell. The resulting organ is harvested and sold to upmarket stores and restaurants. The sale of foie gras is banned from many UK supermarkets and department stores, all of whom . Cold weather gear: BBC news reader Evan Davis wears a North Face jacket to report from Switzerland . cited animal welfare as the reason for dropping the product. But while many North Face fans who buy the brand's quilted jackets would not dream of eating foie gras, they are unwittingly supporting the trade by wearing feathers acquired from farms who use the intense feeding method. Previously the company, which reports annual sales in excess of £900m, had claimed in its literature that the feathers used in The North Face products were taken from 'the very best source - small family-owned farms in Hungary.' A 2010 brochure issued by the firm stipulated its animal welfare . standards - and specifically mentions that the brand would not use goose . down from a supplier that force-fed geese. It said: 'We use only the finest grades of grey goose down from the very best . source — small family owned farms in Hungary. 'At no time are the geese live-plucked for their down. Along with . banning live-plucking, force feeding - for foie gras - has been banned in . the supply chain of The North Face down material for many years.' With a very different story emerging, many North Face buyers will undoubtedly be rethinking their . Northface explains:'Goose down from this region is unrivalled for its quality and consistency, and providesthe . absolute finest sleeping bag insulation possible. 'Geese from this . region have the largest plumules with the best structure... warmest and most durable.. They [create products that] will retain their excellent insulating properties for . many years. 'Due to . the transparent supply chain, we’re assured a fresh harvest every year, a . harvest that has not been damaged by moisture, stockpiled or mixed with . other species of fowl. 'High . fillpower qualities (850 fill power and up) come from more mature geese . that are used as a personal meat source for the farmers, hence the . smaller available quantity and increased cost for these qualities.'

Along with banning live-lucking, force feeding - for foie gras - has been banned in the supply chain of The North Face down material for many years.' position. One, 33-year-old Jane Daley, said she would now feel uncomfortable wearing the down ski jacket she bought from The North Face last year. 'It has left an unpleasant taste in my mouth, there's no doubt about that. I am passionate about animal welfare and have never touched foie gras. To think I've been wearing a jacket filled with the down of a force-fed goose horrifies me. 'North Face should apologise immediately and let consumers know exactly how they plan to shift their supply chain - and they must do it as quickly as possible. They must be accountable and they must act fast - or risk losing customers.' The North Face, which uses grey goose down in around 100 of its products, buys in the down from Californian company Allied Feather & Down. The plight of the geese was discovered when outdoor clothing brand Patagonia, who also buys down from Allied, investigated the Hungarian suppliers at the behest of animal rights campaigners. They found that the farms were employing force-feeding methods. Patagonia is currently exploring other suppliers, along with The North Face, but given that most geese farmers in Hungary produce foie gras, the challenge is not an easy one. The North Face told the Telegraph: 'All of the down we are supplied by Allied Feather is a by-product of the food industry which, as the largest purchaser of goose product, drives the practice of force-feeding. 'We are working to identify alternative long-term sources of goose down that is not a by-product of force-feeding.' Cruel?

It spurred her into action and she put both her and Gracie on a strict diet. Whopping weight loss: Lucy Insley dropped a staggering eight dress sizes . In just over a year, she has lost almost 12 stone and Gracie is nearly 4lbs lighter. Lucy, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, said: 'I didn’t realise just how big I had got until I saw the picture of me and my pug, Gracie. 'I was absolutely mortified by it. At that point I knew I had to do something about the pounds I’d piled on. 'It’s been hard but now I look and feel great. People stare at me for a different reason.' Lucy Insley, 35, started piling on the . pounds as a teenager and by the time she hit 30 she struggled to squeeze . into her size 32 jeans. In March last year, lacking in confidence and energy, Lucy decided to join the Cambridge Weight Plan. The registered nurse bulged to a size 32 after gorging on takeaway meals and donor kebabs and admits her biggest weakness was chocolate cake. Podgy pals: Lucy decided to lose weight after seeing a photo of her and her dog Gracie and being shocked by their similarity . She said: 'I would eat at least one whole cake, all to myself, a week and I used to deep-fry all my meals, I absolutely loved chips and had them with everything. I cringe when I think back to what I used to eat. 'I used to see my mum on a weekly basis and even she would notice each visit how much weight I’d gain within a few days. I was eating the wrong foods, in the wrong portion sizes and at the wrong times, whilst doing absolutely no exercise.' Different person: Lucy now feels confident to buy clothes that she wants . Unhealthy eating habits coupled with a lack of exercise resulted in Lucy suffering from crippling back pain. Her health problems encouraged her to ditch the fatty food and embark on a grueling exercise regime. Lucy still allows herself the occasional treat and said: 'I still love pizza and sometimes I treat myself to a slice but I’ve learned not to over-indulge and can now stop myself from eating the whole pizza, just having the one small piece. If I have something naughty I’ll make sure I burn it off at the gym too.' Although pugs are designed to be chunky, Gracie needed to lose a bit of weight too. Before, Gracie and Lucy struggled to walk short distances and even used to drive 400 yards down the road to the shop to stock up on sugary snacks. Lucy is now a slender size 14, after quitting sweets and chocolate, and both she and Gracie are reaping the benefits of their weight loss, taking long walks and getting plenty of exercise. Lucy is also enjoying refreshing her wardrobe, having dropped eight dress sizes, and said: 'I love being able to pop into high street shops like River Island and buy clothes I’d never have even dreamed of wearing.' She used to hide behind jet black clothing and her long, dark hair, but now Lucy has the confidence to go for a short, bleach blonde style and wears bright, colourful dresses and heels. Despite this she clings onto her old clothes and said: 'I’ve kept the top and jeans that I was wearing in the picture with Gracie to remind me how far I’ve come. I never want to put the weight back on and seeing them hang like tents in my wardrobe makes me determined to stay slim.' Lucy said: 'I definitely feel much sexier now. I sometimes now go out on dates, but working at the care home and going to the gym doesn’t leave me with much time to meet men!' The picture of Lucy and Gracie was taken at a work party and uploaded to a photo album on the work computers that all staff could access and colleagues have noticed a massive difference in Lucy’s confidence since losing the weight. She said: 'People at work call me Tigger from Winnie the Pooh because I’m always happy and bouncing around with bundles of energy, whereas before I used to mope around like Eeyore!' Lucy only has a stone and a half to lose before achieving her target weight of ten stone. She said: 'Gracie is my inspiration, my one and all.

Writing on the Centrepoint website, Seyi revealed: 'William was determined to do it as patron to raise awareness of the problem and to be able to understand a little better what rough sleepers go through.' Charitable work: Princess Diana was the patron of the Centrepoint charity for the homeless and introduced her son to the good cause . At the time, a St James' Palace spokesman said: 'Prince William took away from the experience the importance of tackling all the issues that cause people to be homeless and stay homeless, from drug dependency to mental health problems.' Centrepoint helps the homeless in London and the North East and was one of six organisations Diana remained patron of when she scaled back her charitable interests. Kate and William visited the charity last year and joined in on a healthy eating cookery programme. The work of William and Kate is fundamental to the charity as the latest figures reveal that there has been a 20 per cent increase in those sleeping rough in a year .",Kate to sleep rough to raise awareness of London's homelessness issue .

But in the first episode of her new series, the frizzy haired hotelier gets more than she bargained. As part of her crusade to make over the nation’s hotels, perfectionist Alex’s first stop is suburban Birmingham where she is set to help ex farmer Tim Higgs discover why his elite nudist resort is less than swinging. 56-year-old Tim hoped to turn his love of being naked in to a business and sunk his life savings – over £1million - in to developing the detached seven-bedroom house in to Clover Spa, a fully nude hotel. Blushes: Undressing to impress at the retreat . Tim says: ‘For me naturism is a natural thing. To feel the sun on your skin and the breeze on your body is a lovely feeling.' But 15 months on bookings are at an all-time low, and Alex thinks she knows why. All are welcome as long as they abide by the fully naked rules at all times and unusually for a nudist resort Tim’s 'let it all hang out' policy is strictly enforced in all areas, including the kitchen, dining room and spa. Steamy: Alex enjoys the facilities at the Clover Spa . Giggles: A guest relaxes in the communal areas while Alex enjoys the view . Arriving at the hotel a nervous looking Alex asks “Do I have to get undressed straight away?’ She . resists for a while, content to just enjoy the view, but soon the game . hotelier attempts to join in by going for an au naturel dip in the . Jacuzzi and enjoying some of the hotel’s spa services. But – of course - Tim and Alex soon clash with her insisting that Tim’s strict and uncompromising no-clothes dress code is putting off more people than it attracts. Hopeful: Tim scrubs the spa ready for new guests . Aside from the nakedness Alex is also less than impressed with the catering (ready prepared microwaved meals to avoid injury) garden and the décor of the £80 rooms, labelling the hotel ‘sterile’ and ‘anodyne’. As well as offering style and menu advice the expert wants guests to be able to wear clothes at most times with some naked-only areas. A hot tub showdown later and Tim's stubborn streak is eventually worn down, leading to a raft of happy new clothes-free groups falling in love with Clover.

One of two brothers who were born with a rare genetic disorder, has told how they grew up without ever feeling pain. Steven Pete, 31, from Washington said although he and his late brother, Christopher, had a sense of touch, they had no pain receptors and at five months old, Steven had chewed off a quarter of his tongue while teething. His parents took the babies to a pediatrician where they underwent a series of tests. Steven told BBC: 'At first they put a cigarette lighter underneath my foot and waited for my skin to blister... Then they began running needles up and down my spine. I had no response to either.' Suffering with no pain: Steven Pete, 31, said although he and his late brother, Christopher, had a sense of touch, they had no pain receptors . The brothers grew up on a farm, where his protective parents struggled with a balance of giving them enough freedom while also watching their every move. Steven, who was frequently absent from school because of injury and illness, and also usually in a cast, said: . 'When you're out in the country, especially if you're a boy, you're . going to go out and explore and get in a little mischief. Grown up: Steven (pictured), believes having to live with congenital analgesia was why his brother chose to take his own life . 'There was one time, at the roller-skating rink. I can't recall all of the details, but I know that I broke my leg. People were pointing at me because my pants were just covered in blood from where the bone came out. After that, I wasn't allowed to roller skate until I was much older.' Having to live with congenital . analgesia, feeling no physical pain, might appear to some to be a . strange gift, however Steven believes it was why his brother chose to . take his own life. Steven said: 'His back was getting progressively worse. He was pretty close to . graduating from a local college and the doctors told him that probably . in the next year, year-and-a-half, he would be in a wheelchair.' Steven . recalls how at five or six years old, he was taken away from his . parents by child protective services after someone reported them for . child abuse. Eventually, while the state's care for approximately two . months, he broke his leg. He said: 'They finally realised that my parents and the pediatrician were telling the truth about my condition.' He also recalls how he was involved . in a lot of fights during school. When a new student arrived at his . school, the other children would egg that person on to pick a fight with . Steven, as an introduction to the school. 'They would say: ""If you can't feel pain, you will once I'm done with you,"" he remembers. He admits that he fears internal injuries the most, especially appendicitis. Hospital visits: Steven, who was frequently absent from school because of injury and illness, and also usually in a cast, is pictured with his brother . 'Usually whenever I have any type of stomach issues or a fever I go to the hospital just to get it checked out,' he said. 'The . last time I had a broken bone, my wife actually noticed before I did. My foot was swollen, black and blue, so I went to the doctor and had an . X-ray and they told me that I had broken two of my toes and they wanted . to put a cast on it.' He continued: 'I had to go to work the next day. If had a cast on I wasn't going to be able to work for quite some time so I just told them I'd take care of myself. I went home and took some duct tape, taped it up, put my boots on and went to work that next morning.' He says that one thing he will soon have to face is the fact that he will eventually lose his left leg. 'I've had quite a bit of surgery on my left knee in the past and it's got to the point where my doctors have told me to wait until it gives out completely.

"Shanice Bulman was size 24 and weighed 23 stone . She has beat her goal and lost six stone in five months . Money will go to a childless couple to fund IVF treatment . By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 06:14 EST, 31 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:12 EST, 31 July 2012 . Everyone needs some form of motivation in their quest to shift that unwanted weight. And one inspirational woman undertook a sponsored slim to raise money for a childless couple to have the IVF-treatment that may give them a child. And the incentive to help has certainly been a success story, after Shanice Bulman has already lost six stone in just five months. Shanice Bulman weighed 22 stone in January when she decided to take action . The 20-year-old from Hull, East Yorkshire, hated the sight of her size 24 body and at almost 23 stone, she no longer wanted to lead an unhealthy lifestyle, after not recognising herself when she looked in the mirror. She said: 'I was getting ready and, usually, I’d feel great. I always wore nice clothes and did my hair and make-up. But my face looked swollen - I didn’t feel like Shanice any more.' She lost six stone in just five months after eating healthy food and training hard . Shanice has hit her target one month ahead of schedule and she says she has never felt better. She said: 'At the moment, this is the best I’ve ever felt,” she says. “Every day I wake up, I feel better than the day before.' Shanice’s old habits meant she would wake up and skip breakfast before gorging on sandwiches, crisps and chocolate before she ate her lunch. Her evening meal would consist of chicken wraps, rice, cheese or bread, followed by cups of tea and biscuits. But, after turning her life around, she now visits the gym at least four times a week, facing two gruelling sessions with her personal trainer, James Brereton each week. James also gave her an extra incentive to get fit - by donating £28 of her session fees to her sponsorship total. Her hard work means Shanice has dropped four dress sizes since her weight war began, slimming-down to a size 16. Shanice has had to turn her whole life around, following a strict healthy eating plan set by James. She said: 'You have to change your whole lifestyle. Now, I cook for myself all the time - once I got my head around it, it’s the easiest thing I have ever done in my life. I even lost 1Ib on holiday. 'I feel like I have blinked and the six months has gone. It’s changed my life completely. If I have children in the future, I will raise them to be active and healthy and cook meals from fresh. 'I don’t class myself as being on a diet any more. It’s my lifestyle and this is how I want to eat.' Shanice has already met with health officials at the Hull IVF Unit and will pick the couple to have treatment once she has raised the full £5,000. She has so far raised £4,000 but wants to make sure she reaches her target so there is £500 left for baby clothes. Shanice said: 'I would like to choose people who do not already have children, have had IVF once or twice and have been unsuccessful but still stand a good chance of becoming pregnant. 'Once I have given the money, I will feel complete - I set myself a challenge to raise this money for them. If they wanted to meet me, that would be amazing, but it’s OK if they don’t. 'Even if they don’t manage to get pregnant, at least they have had the extra opportunity. Shanice has worked hard with trainer James Brereton to lose the weight, which she is being sponsored to do to fund IVF treatment . 'I have worked so hard, but if it takes me until Christmas to get all the money in, it takes me until Christmas.' Shanice is taking her weight loss process one step further and really turning it into a positive experience, she wants to become a mentor to help overweight people achieve similar goals. Her parents plan to help her open her own studio in the city as a 21st birthday present, creating a base for her to support others. Shanice said: 'I want to be there for people 24/7 and figure out what is going to work best for them so I can advise them on their lifestyle. Shanice set herself the challenge of losing six stone in as many months, she has beaten her goal and raised money doing it . 'The difference between me and your average personal trainer is I was 4lbs off 23st when I started and I know how that feels. 'The support I have had has been incredible, from people I don’t know e-mailing me, to people sending me messages to say I’m an inspiration. 'My parents and my sisters have been my lifeline and James has been amazing too and we have become good friends - I can’t thank him enough.'","Shanice Bulman was size 24 and weighed 23 stone .

The Sri Lankan father of two, known to his friends as Cooray, trains for his marathon dash by running 17 miles to and from work every day, and eating a pasty when he gets there. Run, Cooray, run! Olympian Anuradha Cooray steams ahead of the competition at Bearbrook Running Club's annual 10k road race in 2011 . The 34-year-old runner, who has 18-month-old twins, said: 'I have a pasty a day.

A mother-of-ten has confessed to receiving more than 50k in unemployment benefits from the Government - despite being perfectly capable of going out to work to earn the money herself. Stephanie Fennessy-Sharp, 29, lives with her partner Ian Sharp and six of their ten children in a five-bedroom detached house in Kent. Neither she nor 56-year-old Ian work. Instead, they claim the equivalent of a £72k salary before tax - and it's all down to a skewed benefits system that discourages unemployed claimants from going out to find work. Ian suffers debilitating headaches that he says prevent him from working. But Stephanie is perfectly healthy - and confesses she could work, but chooses not to because she is better off on benefits. Shameless: Stephanie, 29, centre, pictured with partner Ian, 56, and their ten children - Bobbie, Cameron, Jack, Stephen, Sian, Charlie, Alex, Summer, Callum and Nicole - says she knows she is taking advantage of the benefits system - but blames the government for making it 'so easy' In fact, Stephanie currently works a 40-hour-week in a charity shop for free, because she says she is not a 'stereotypical scrounger' and she wants her children to have a strong work ethic. They do not know she is not paid for her charity shop work, she says. But Stephanie, who says she volunteers to 'give something back to society', says in an interview with Closer magazine that it makes more sense for her to work for free than to get a job that would pay a fraction of her handouts and lose her benefits. Stephanie, who used to work in a shop before leaving work after having her second child, has three children of her own, Jack, 10, Charlie, eight, and Steven, six, with her ex-husband, and is stepmother to Ian's seven children - Bobbie, 19, Nicole, 16, Alexandra, 14, Sian, 13, Callum, 10, Cameron, seven, and Summer, three from his relationship with his ex-wife. She says that she dreamed of being a teacher before having children put paid to her goal. Before she split with the father of her three children, she lived in a three-bedroom house, paid for with housing benefit, and claimed income support, child benefit, child tax credits and council tax benefit. When she subsequently met Ian, who left his job as a factory worker 20 years ago after he began suffering migraines, she took on the role as his permanent carer - enabling her to claim carer's allowance in addition to Ian's £60 a week incapacity benefit. Grace and favour: Stephanie, her partner Ian and six of their ten children live in a five-bedroom house in leafy Kent paid for with housing benefits . It also allows Stephanie to be exempt from the Jobseekers Allowance rules, meaning she does not lose her benefits when she fails to look for employment. To receive carer's allowance, Stephanie should be caring for Ian 35 hours a week, which she admits she doesn't need to, given that Ian suffers from headaches only once every few weeks. Between them, the family claim £4,524 child benefit, £14,456 tax credits, £1,200 council tax benefit and £8,320 incapacity benefit. They also receive £20,400 housing benefit a year, which works out at £1,700 a month. In total, they get £48,900 a year. They were given a four-bedroom council house in April 2010, which they swapped in February 2011 for a privately rented five-bedroom house in Erith after they complained of damp. Their new house, in a leafy suburban area, has a large garden, driveway and a garage for their Toyota Previa people carrier. 'The benefits are being offered to me, so I'd be silly to turn them down. I know taxpayers are being punished – I hate taking their money. But we're being allowed to get away with it,' Stephanie says . Stephanie, who admits some of the benefits paid to her she does not even need, says in that she and her family are not 'scroungers who watch TV all day.'. 'We're taking advantage of the system, but that's the system's fault – we'd be silly not to with so many mouths to feed,' she told Closer. 'It's ridiculous, but I'm better off volunteering than earning – we're well off and I'm not going to give that up until I have to.' Worryingly, Stephanie's situation is far from unusual. Government statistics show that the annual benefits bill has reached almost £13bn. Stephanie, who says she is smart with her money, never buying expensive treats and using only secondhand clothes, is candid about the fact they are playing the benefits system to its fullest. She says: 'Obviously, I could work and I'd like to. I feel guilty about how much we claim – we don't even need a five-bedroom house as the kids could share. But it's a nice area with good schools. 'We got the upgrade after we told the council we didn't like our old house – it was damp and one of the kids' bedrooms was by the front door, which worried me. It's nice having the extra space for when Ian's other kids stay. 'The benefits are being offered to me, so I'd be silly to turn them down. I know taxpayers are being punished – I hate taking their money. But we're being allowed to get away with it,' she adds. 'The minimum wage is too low and you lose your benefits if you work, but they're too easy to get if you don't work' The mother, who has nine GSCEs at grade A to C, says that she comes from hard-working stock and being jobless goes 'against the grain'. 'My dad works on the London Underground and I want my kids to get good jobs. I worry people look at us and think, ‘Look at that trampy benefits family.' She says she works in the the charity shop from 9am to 5.30pm four days a week because she doesn't want to fall into the trap of 'no job, no confidence. 'I want to meet new people – and teach my kids a work ethic. My young children think I get paid for working at the charity shop.' Stephanie insists the job gives her a sense of pride - but that if she were to work in a shop for a wage, the money she would be paid (she estimates £13,000) wouldn't cover her rent. 'I don't have a choice,' she told Closer. 'I feel like this situation has been forced upon us by the Government. Read more: The full feature appears in this week's Closer magazine, on sale now . 'The minimum wage is too low and you lose your benefits if you work, but they're too easy to get if you don't work.' The Government plans to introduce a Reform Bill next year, which aims to introduce an annual cap of £26,000 on benefits. But Stephanie and Ian could be exempt because Ian is off work 'on the sick'. Surprisingly, Stephanie is philosophical about one day losing her benefits, saying that if they were to go, the family would have to make cutbacks. They would move to a smaller house, get rid of mobiles and the Internet, she says. 'It'll be tough – but I understand it has to happen. There has to be an overhaul,' she says. 'I'm preparing for the change – I'm studying for an NVQ in retail and customer service, which I don't have to pay for. If I have to get a job, I want a good one. But, for now, I just have to make the most of the system while I can.' For his part, Ian says he would love to get a job, but that if he works for more than an hour, he feels 'ill and stressed'. He takes the children to school and helps with the housework, but says that the exertion means he has to rest if he gets light-headed. He adds: 'I only get migraines every three weeks, but I qualify for sick pay – and if I didn't take it, I wouldn't have any money.'","Stephanie Fennessy-Sharp, 28, lives in a five-bed house paid for with housing benefit .

The 31-year-old, who will be hoping to retain her Olympic crown in London this summer, displayed steely determination while regaining her Track Cycling World Championships title. Scroll down for video . Neck and neck: Victoria Pendleton, right, begins to lose control of her front wheel as she clashes arms with arch rival Anna Meares during the pair's dramatic World Championship semi-final in Melbourne today . Top speed: With the pair sprinting side by side at around 40mph, Pendleton's bike begins to unexpectedly fall from under her . Losing control: Pendleton, 31, comes perilously close to clashing with Meares's bike as she slips on the wooden racing surface . In danger: The World and Olympic champion braces herself for the impact of the fall during the first bout of a tense semi-final in Australia . On the deck: Australian Meares ploughs past Pendleton as the Briton skids painfully along the wooden surfrace . Pendleton had been battling Australian Anna Meares in the semi-final of the event when she dramatically crashed from her bike in the first race bout. Stunned spectators saw the Briton race wheel to wheel against Meares before the pair rounded a corner and Pendleton's front wheel skidded off course in front of her. Pendleton tumbled inches from her opponent's front wheel before skidding for metres along the wooden track. Putting her body on the line: Pendleton, with her body still on her bike, skidded along the track and sustained track burns to her shoulder, elbow and hip . The 31-year-old look stunned and slightly dazed after her unexpected and potentially nasty-looking fall, but managed to overcome her minor injuries . Helping hand: Members of the British team immediately rushed to Pendleton's side after her fall so she could continue with the semi-final . Back in the saddle: The brave Olympic star showed her battling qualities by recovering to win her semi-final and eventually retain her World Championship crown .

Best of British: Pendleton, pictured here at an awards ceremony last year, will be hoping to finish her career on a high when she retires after the London Olympics . Members of the British team rushed to the . Olympic champion's aid after her crash, as Pendleton lay at the side of . the track and removed her helmet. Pendleton escaped major injury despite the serious-looking fall, sustaining track burn on her right shoulder, elbow and hip. Showing the admirable battling qualities which have made her a nine-time world champion, Pendleton dusted herself down and fought through the semi-final against home favourite Meares. The Australian, competing in front of a home crowd in Melbourne, was adjudged to have impeded her opponent by going outside the sprinters' lane in the following bout. Then, in a spectacular deciding race, Pendleton again cycled wheel-to-wheel against her arch rival with burns clearly showing through holes in her lycra suit, but managed to snatch victory in a photo finish. Even without her injury, the achievement . was no mean feat, as her fierce rival Meares had broken a world record . in qualifying before defeat to Pendleton. After the crash, Pendleton played down the crash which led to her being heavily bandaged before the final. She told BBC Sport: 'It's not too bad. I lost my balance, went too far in one direction and lost my traction. 'My dad always said you don't do track cycling unless you're prepared to crash. 'I slid quite nicely, which sounds random, and I felt fine. I could tell it was just surface wounds.' Her .

First British men got back on their bikes and joined cycling clubs to copy the Tour De France winner. (Tthe British Cycling Club . reported 1500 new members on the day Wiggins won the Olympic men's individual time trial). Then UK men gave themselves sideburns.

Googe, trends expert at men's fashion retailer High And Mighty, said he . has had a flurry of customers enquiring about getting Wiggo's look. He said: 'It started with cut-out . sideburns and everyone talking about Bradley's style with light-hearted . praise, but what we are seeing now is a real determination to copy this . gold medal-winning Olympic star's look. 'His style is deliberately 'mod', paying attention to key aspects such as tailored suits, skinny trousers and loafers. 'His icons are stars such as Paul Weller and The Who's Pete Townshend, and this is represented in the way he styles himself.' Bradley Wiggins with his style hero Paul Weller . Polo shirts, a Wiggo sartorial staple, have been flying off shelves at shops such as High And Mighty . The term 'mod', which derives from the . word 'modernist', was first coined in the 1950s as a way to describe . British style-conscious modern jazz fans. The term is synonymous with those who are fashionable, modern and popular. Mr Googe continued: 'Customers are really keen to achieve the 'Wiggo' look and we are helping style them in this way.

Twin boys who were born with a combined weight of less than three-and-a-half pounds have defied the odds to survive thanks to modern medicine. George and Harrison Kent were 15 weeks premature, suffered numerous health problems including twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, and were treated in six different hospitals. Doctors feared they would not survive, but five months after their birth the pair have gone home to Bocking in Essex weighing a healthy 7lb 11oz and 7lb 14oz. Double trouble: Stuart and Melanie Kent with their twins Harrison (left) and George. The twins were born 15 weeks early . Their mother Melanie, 25, said: 'They are my little miracles. They will be strong little fighters.' Nursery nurse Melanie, and her husband Stuart, 26, who is a British Gas engineer, discovered they were expecting identical twins in August. But at 16 weeks, doctors said they were suffering twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, with Harrison taking too much blood from George which could have stopped his brother growing. Melanie underwent laser treatment to drain four litres of excess amniotic fluid from around George. Without the treatment, she could have lost both boys but the procedure induced an early labour. Mrs Kent gave birth naturally three days later on December 11 at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford. George weighed 1lb 9oz while Harrison was 1lb 12oz. The twins were whisked to different hospitals - George to Chertsey and Harrison to Luton and Dunstable - while Melanie remained at Broomfield with an infection. She saw her babies two days later and months of travelling miles between hospitals followed. George Kent (left) and Harrison (right) hours after birth at Broomfield Hospital.

George, who was moved to Norfolk and Norwich Hospital a few days after his birth, had a tear in his small bowel but managed to recover. Harrison - who was moved to the same hospital earlier this year had a gastrointestinal disease affecting the bowel which resulted in him three quarters of his bowel being removed. He also needed a stent fitted to close a duct on his heart at Great Ormond Street Hospital. Doctors feared the worst when he was struck down with group B streptococcus in March, yet again he managed to revive. Mrs Kent said: 'His body was in complete shutdown but 24 hours later he was like a completely different baby.' Feisty family: Melanie said her twins Harrison (left) and George both had tempers .

"43% of Brits keep photos of former partners following a break-up . One in five men hide these photos for fear of their new partner disapproving . By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 04:23 EST, 26 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:09 EST, 26 July 2012 . No break up is easy. From the memories you shared to 'your song', it is hard to forget about a former lover overnight. While millionairess Tamara Ecclestone has tasked bodyguards with ridding her home of every trace of her love rat ex-boyfriend Omar Khyami, new research shows that not all of us are that strong-willed. The new study, by Friends Reunited, shows many of us can’t bring ourselves to be so cut-throat with the latest findings revealing that 21.6 million Brits have held onto photographs of former partners following a break up. Will Katie finally have taken down her poster of Tom that she kept on her wall as a teenager? Women are more sentimental than men, with 61 per cent claiming they keep the photos as they highlight a part of their life they don’t want to forget, versus 56 per cent of men. But men may be hiding more from their partners than their other halves realise. One in five men (20%) in a current relationship who have photos of their ex partners say they have hidden photos of an ex fearing disapproval from their new partner, compared to only nine per cent of women. Men also seem to have more weighing on their conscience, as 17 per cent said they ‘sometimes feel guilty about keeping photos of their ex partners’, compared to just 11 per cent of their female counterparts. Jennifer Anniston has struggled to find a permanent lover since her split with heartthrob Brad Pitt . They may have good reason for this, however, as more than one in ten men who keep photos of their ex partners (12 per cent) admit they still have feelings for their ex, compared to only five percent of women. Corinne Sweet, behavioral psychologist said: 'It’s not surprising that nearly half of us keep some kind of visual memento of past partners; a photo generates strong emotions as it unleashes memories of past attachment and times. 'The main reason people hide their photos (especially men) is probably due to a fear of their current partner’s jealousy, or of evoking comparisons in terms of attractiveness and sexiness, etc. Emotionally mature partners will be able to accept you have a past love-life. Does Madonna treasure this romantic snap of her and Guy Ritchie taken in happier times in 2008? 'The point at which people are able to put an ex-partner’s photo away (after a split, divorce or death) is usually the time they are emotionally ready to move on. 'Yet, it is totally understandable for people to keep photos to remind them of previous loves, as, indeed, these images do form part of our life stories – whether for better or for worse.' The majority of us (48 per cent) keep these . snaps in old photo albums, but others (31 per cent) stash them in cupboards and . drawers, or in the attic (12%). Nine per cent of men say they purposely . keep the photos in hidden files on their computer. Matt Bushby, Head of Friends . Reunited, said: 'We all have photos from our past we want to keep; . whether we want to share with others, or remain private. 'Old photos are . often the best – they bring back memories and blasts from the pasts, . even if we think we’d sometimes prefer to forget! The new Friends . Reunited site is the one place you can search, collect and save . treasured personal memories, especially old photos that have a special . place in our hearts and you make them totally private if you want too!' It was part of my life/growing up that I don’t want to forget . They bring back good memories . I don’t like throwing any photos away . They remind me of a special event . I look good in the photos . They make me laugh . I still have feelings for my ex . I think we may get back together one day .

He finally went to the doctor after experiencing a number of seemingly unrelated symptoms . A fitness fanatic has revealed how a chance remark about his 'croaky voice' saved his life. The comment by a stranger prompted 50-year-old Richard Wheatley to finally go to his doctor. A brain tumour the size of a golf ball was discovered just in time. It was only after surgeons operated that he realised he had acted just in time - because the tumour eventually would have killed him. Mr Wheatley from Warwick, said: 'It was a worrying time but the operation went well and things have improved massively. 'I’m still recuperating and have trouble with my voice if I talk for too long, but when you consider what the alternative could have been I consider myself lucky to be alive.' Keen runner Richard had completed the London Marathon twice and continued to keep himself fit. However, six years ago he began losing muscle around his right shoulder. He had the problem checked out but no-one could tell him what was wrong. Richard then began to suffer a string of seemingly unrelated minor problems, such as losing his voice and struggling to swallow. He also began losing his balance. He said: 'I had been to the summit of Snowdon and Ben Nevis, but a trip to the Lake District worried me as I seemed so unsteady on my feet. 'Nothing by itself seemed bad enough to make me worry as it all happened over a period of time. 'I actually thought old age might be catching up with me.' Richard decided to go back to his doctor in December after a stranger he met in St Lucia remarked that his voice sounded strange and croaky, confirming his own fears that it had changed. Richard said: 'I thought my voice had changed - it would tire and start croaking - but my family hadn’t noticed. I put it down to the air conditioning in the office.' This MRI scan from 20th December 2011 shows the golf ball sized tumour inside Richard's brain . This time he wrote down a full list of all his niggling problems, which was enough to worry his doctor. Richard and his wife before the brain tumor struck. He was told he had been just six months from death . Richard . was referred to the BMI Priory Hospital in Birmingham, where scans . revealed a large, non-cancerous tumour inside his skull. It was pressing on nerves in Richard’s brain and affecting his speech, balance and ability to swallow. Days later, surgeons carried out a nine-hour operation to remove the tumour behind his right ear. By the time the tumour was diagnosed Richard had suffered some nerve damage. That means his voice still tires, he has some difficulty swallowing and his balance is still adjusting to the tumour being removed. 'Those are relatively little things,' said Richard, who works as a relationship manager at NatWest bank. 'I can still drive a car, go on holiday and live a very normal life. I owe my life to Mr Irving’s expertise, his team were fantastic.' Although Richard is not going to do any more marathons, he has taken up golf and wants to start running again. 'I am determined to make the most of this second chance I have been given,' he said.","Richard had assumed symptoms such as balance problems were due to getting older .

Adults are less likely to suffer from depression if they were breast-fed as infants, according to scientists. However, the amount of time a person was breast-fed has no bearing on the severity of later depression. German researchers studied 52 people with an average age of 44 who were being treated for severe depression at an inpatient facility. Nurturing: Adults are less likely to suffer from depression if they were breast-fed as infants, according to scientists . The patients were considered to have been breast-fed if they, or their mothers, stated that they been nursed for more than two weeks. They then contrasted these results with those gathered from 106 people without mental health problems. The study revealed that some 73 per cent of those who didn't suffer from depression had been breast-fed, compared to just 46 per cent of people with depression. Despite these results, the scientists said that there is no cause-and-effect relationship between breast-feeding, or lack thereof, and depression, reports MyHealthNewsDaily. Firstly, a mother who breastfeeds might be more likely to go on to provide her child with a more loving environment growing up, thus lowering the chance of a child suffering from depression in adulthood. Secondly, breastfeeding could be linked to an increase in the hormone oxytocin being released in mothers, which protects against stress. Thirdly, the researchers said, breast milk could contain components that help prevent against depression. Lastly, breast-feeding may lower the risk for diseases, like hypertension, which have been shown to be associated with an increased risk for depression. The study is published in the journal Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics.Its authors claim it is the first report showing an association between breast-feeding and the occurrence of depression later on in adulthood. However, they admit that the limited sample size and the inevitably retrospective nature of this analysis are limitations.",German researchers find that amount of time a person was breast-fed has no bearing on the severity of later depression .

Billy Davies was told his hairstyle was too ‘extreme’ for the classroom because it is shaved into a ‘V’ shape at the back - similar to one previously sported by the Manchester United striker. Teachers at Park Community School in Havant, Hampshire, decided to bar the 15-year-old from all of his lessons until his hair grows back. 'Extreme': Billy Davies' hairstyle was branded 'extreme' by teachers and he was told he could not join lessons because it breached uniform policy at Park Community School in, Havant . But furious Jackie Davies said: ‘The school is being pedantic. His hair isn’t extreme at all. ‘I could understand if he was going to school with purple or blue hair but that’s not the case.’ The teen, who lives with his parents in Havant, said: ‘It’s stupid because I don’t think there’s anything wrong with my hair. ‘It’s fashionable and a lot of my friends have the same sort of haircut, yet I’m the only one who has been punished. ‘Some of the students even have pink hair.

"By . Allan Hall . UPDATED: . 09:27 EST, 7 October 2011 . A Swiss couple have come forward to claim that the mysterious 'Forest Boy' is their grandson. The pair are due to give a DNA sample which will be tested against that of the boy, Ray, who appeared in Berlin last month claiming to have been living in the forest for five years. Berlin's B.Z. newspaper today reported that Ray's photo was seen by the couple in Switzerland and they then contacted police. Ray's past: Experts are struggling to work out who the boy really is and what has happened to him . There was no official comment from authorities in Berlin and no further detail in the newspaper report. Police and social workers began suspecting two weeks ago that Ray's story was bogus and that his motives were suspect. He is only 17 and now in the care of social workers after a legal guardian was appointed to represent his interests. If it is found that he comes from Switzerland he will be deported back there. The blonde, blue-eyed boy claimed to remember few details about his life when he turned up on the steps of a town hall in the east of Berlin on September 5. Lost in translation: The boy turned up in Berlin alone and saying he had been living rough in the woods . He told a tale - in accented English - . that gripped the imagination of the world. He said he had been living . in a tent in a forest for five years with his father, called Ryan, and . that his mother Doreen had died in a car crash five years previously. He said that his father died suddenly in the woods and he began walking towards Berlin. He said he had buried his father among the trees. 'I'm all alone, please help me,' he said. He was taken into care at a cost to the German taxpayer of around £2,500 per month. Wilderness: The teenager's history is shrouded in darkness - but this new claim could shed new light on his history . But his tall tale soon began to develop more holes than a Swiss cheese. A check of police computers in all 16 states of Germany found that no one by the name of Doreen had died in a car crash in the past decade. No sign of a grave has been found in cursory searches of forests in the Harz Mountains, along the Bavarian-Czech border or in Thuringia. Ray is unable to pinpoint the forest where he said he lived, he is also unable to say what nationality he is. Officials originally thought he could be British because he speaks English but only basic German, although they now doubt this. The tent he carried did not look as if it had sustained five years of treatment in a German forest and Ray was well dressed and clean. As Interpol was alerted to check with police forces for missing people in other European countries, Ray triggered more suspicion when he said he did not want to pose for photographs or make an appeal to try to find any of his family. 'They're all dead,' he said.  'I just want to get on and make a new life for myself.' A police spokesman said: 'Unfortunately it seems that the boy told his guardian that he wasn't interested in discovering who he was.' But now the Swiss link is the most promising development so far. If true, Germany would be in a position to make a claim from Switzerland for money towards Ray's upkeep so far.","Holes appearing in 17-year-old's claims .

The biggest-ever EuroMillions prize received in the UK went to Ayrshire couple Colin and Christine Weir who won £161million in July last year, making them almost as wealthy as the Beckhams. Another anonymous ticket holder collected £113m, while and Dave and Angela Dawes, from Cambridgeshire, scooped £101m in October.

A teenager who suffers from a rare condition that made her sick up to 30 times a day is at last on the road to recovery after she had a pacemaker fitted in her stomach. Laura Ormiston, 19, had been in agony for years after she developed gastroparesis, paralysis of the stomach muscles, in 2007. The condition caused the desperate teen to vomit up to 30 times a day, and saw her shrink to seven stone. Recovering: Laura with her dog (left) is now able to go on holiday and eat proper meals. She shrunk to 7st due to a mystery condition that was revealed to be gastroparesis . Over the next few years puzzled doctors . explored everything from appendicitis to irritable bowel syndrome, as . well as kidney problems and cancer. Finally she was diagnosed with gastroparesis. Laura, from Eaglesham, near Glasgow, said: 'I was absolutely stunned when doctors said I would have to have a pacemaker fitted. 'But now, I'm so grateful for it. 'When doctors first suggested a pacemaker to me, I was really shocked - I thought they were just something that old people needed for heart conditions. 'It's not a cure, it's more of a way to manage my symptoms. It's been a living hell trying to find out what was wrong. 'Some days I was so ill I felt like I wanted to die. I said ""Don't treat me any more, just let me go"". 'But then I wake up the next day and say 'That wasn't me, that was the pain talking'. 'I finally feel like I'm on the road to recovery.' In 2010 Laura had to be fed nightly through a tube (pictured) Laura, a keen swimmer, first noticed pain in her stomach during a lifesaving class - and mistakenly believed she was suffering from cramp. Laura said: 'I thought it was cramp at first, but I quickly realised it was worse than that. As a swimmer, I'm used to aches and pains, but this did seem worse. 'It was as if somebody was standing with 10 knives stabbing me. 'The pain subsided eventaully, but kept coming back every few days - and when it came back, it got worse.' Her worried parents Elaine, 45, and Robert, 48, took her to A&E at Hairmyres Hospital numerous times but puzzled doctors could not diagnose her. They even suggested to Laura that it could be all in her head. Although they discovered she had an unrelated kidney condition, they couldn't figure out what was causing the pain, which at times left her unable to stand up. Laura is now a healthier size (left) after a gastric pacemaker allowed her to eat properly for the first time in years. Pictured at her school leaver's ball, right . But in February, 2010 Laura took a turn for the worse while in Glasgow Royal Infirmary. She said: 'One day I fell into unconsciousness while I was at the hospital. 'The crash team were called, intensive care doctors and so were my mum and dad. 'I was out of it for about three days and I was moved to the high dependency unit. My body was just shutting down. 'I thought I was dead. It was only because my mum was on one side holding my hand and my dad was on the other that I realised I wasn't. I realised I had something to fight for.' Mother Elaine, said: 'That was the darkest day of my life. They didn't know what was wrong with her.The doctors came to speak to Robert and me and we asked 'Is she going to be OK?' and they said We are doing everything.' But Laura pulled through, and on May 10 that year surgeons opened up her abdomen, leaving her with a big scar down her front, to see if they could discover what was wrong. They still didn't find an answer and when she woke up she was even more poorly. For the next year she was sick up to 30 times a day. She couldn't eat or drink, and had to be fed nightly through a tube. Her weight dropped to under seven stone and she was dangerously ill. Laura was able to do the Race for Life with her proud mother Elaine this year . Laura with her dog Jake: She said the pain felt like being stabbed . That summer, doctors finally discovered what was wrong, after doing tests on Laura'sstomach. She has gastroparesis, paralysis of the stomach muscles, which means they don't contract in the normal way to empty food. That August , Laura was offered a temporary gastric pacemaker. She said: 'For the full six days I could eat and drink and I wasn't sick. The pacemaker has two wires that fed into my stomach and it sets pulses and makes my stomach do what it should do.' However, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said she couldn't have the permanent version, called an enterra, until there was funding but they didn't know how long it could take. Laura said: 'I was at the stage where if I didn't get it I thought I was going to die. It was the only option. I thought 'I cannot do this for the rest of my life.' Laura's scrapbook on her mysterious condition . Finally, the health board said the money was there, and, on April 21, 2011, she became the youngest of only around 50 people in the UK to have it fitted. A spokesperson for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said: 'Patients referred to the gastric pacemaker service have a complex nature of conditions which may require thishighly specialised surgical intervention. 'Before surgery can be considered patients undergo an extensive assessment. The reason for this extensive assessment is the highly specialist nature of the procedure andthe need for the input of a very full multi-disciplinary team. 'This patient has now had a gastric pacemaker fitted and we are delighted to hear she ismaking good progress.' Although she is still in pain, which she must sometimes take morphine to handle, Laura can finally enjoy her life. She has just been on her first holiday to Greece, and is finally able to eat and drink normally. Laura added: 'I could have been diagnosed, and thought, 'that's my life gone'. 'But I've decided that this is what I've got, I can't change it, I might as well make the most of it. 'I want to say thanks to my family and friends because they've been an amazing support.' Her mother said: 'Laura's a very positive and caring girl. You can see her teenage life has been taken away from her. She's just amazing.'","It took doctors four years to diagnose teenager's rare stomach paralysis condition .

Stoke City star Jermaine Pennant allegedly attacked a woman and then crashed his car while drunk in the early hours of this morning. The 29-year-old former England Under-21 international was today charged with drink-driving, driving while disqualified and driving without insurance after his white BMW collided with a silver Audi in Sale at 5.20am. The driver of the Audi was taken to hospital after the collision, which took place ten minutes from Pennant's luxury mansion in Hale, Cheshire. The Audi driver was later discharged after treatment for minor back injuries. Pennant will appear at Trafford Magistrates' Court to hear the driving-related charges on Wednesday 9 . May. Police apparently arrested the footballer following an allegation that a woman had been assaulted at a Manchester nightclub just under two hours before the accident. A police spokesperson said: 'At approximately 3.30am a woman was assaulted at a nightclub on Barton Arcade, Manchester City Centre. 'A 29-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of section 47 assault. He has been bailed pending further inquiries.' Pennant was signed by Arsenal for £2million on his 16th birthday, following a difficult childhood. His career looked to be on the up when he signed for Liverpool for £6.7million and he later went on to play in Spain. Arrested: Pennant was detained for drink-driving while disqualified after his white BMW collided with a silver Audi in Sale at 5.20am yesterday morning . After having a child, Trey, he said his troubled past was behind him, but a few months later he finished with his fiancee Lara Murphy. He joined Stoke in the 2010-11 season and played in Saturday's 1-1 draw with Arsenal. In February 2004, Pennant was given a . sixteen-month ban from driving after being seen in the wrong lane in . Paddington, West London. In 2005, while on loan at . Birmingham, the 22-year-old Arsenal midfielder crashed in the centre of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, at 6.20am. His eyes were glazed and his speech . slurred, and a breath test found he was almost two-and-a-half times the . legal alcohol limit, the court . heard. He spent 30 days in jail for drink-driving and driving . while still serving his previous ban. He initially told officers that he was his Arsenal team mate Ashley Cole. Two years later, the Liverpool player . collapsed on a flight from Spain to Stansted following a 24-hour . drinking binge. This is not the first time Pennant has landed in hot water over his behaviour off the pitch. In February 2004, Pennant was banned from from driving, and in 2005 he spent 30 days in prison for drink-driving and driving . while still serving his previous ban. The teenage prodigy was a £3.2million signing and then the youngest player to play for the club, but Arsene Wenger eventually ran out of patience with his poor time-keeping and lack of discipline. He returned to Birmingham after his conviction - and even played while wearing an electronic tag. Defending Pennant in 2005, Barry Warburton told the court he had never been in trouble during a difficult childhood in Nottingham. Mr Warburton said he grew up on 'one of the worst estates' in the city, the eldest of four children, and brought up the three others after his mother left until he was 15. Pennant had only 'intermittent' schooling, the court heard. 'When he left school and arrived at Arsenal FC, he had very little reading and writing skills. ""They have in fact educated him,' Mr Warburton said. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Stoke City footballer will hear drink-driving charges next week .

Groundbreaking: Truvada will be available as a preventive measure for people who are at high risk of acquiring HIV through sexual activity . A drug that protects people at risk of HIV from infection has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The pill, called Truvada, has been approved as a preventive . measure for people who are at high risk of acquiring the infection, such as those who have HIV-infected partners. The FDA said it marked 'an important milestone in our fight against HIV.' Public health advocates say the approval could help slow the spread . of HIV, which has held steady at about 50,000 new infections per year . for the last 15 years. However, other campaigners have warned that the pills could give patients a false sense of security. An estimated 1.2 million Americans and 83,000 people in the UK have HIV, . which develops into AIDS unless treated with antiviral drugs. With an . estimated 240,000 HIV carriers unaware of their status, doctors and . patients say new methods are needed to fight the spread of the virus. Truvada combines two anti-HIV drugs in one pill. It has been marketed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for people who are already infected with the virus in 2004. But starting in 2010, studies showed that the drug could actually . prevent people from contracting HIV when used as a precautionary . measure. A three-year study found that daily doses cut the risk of . infection in healthy gay and bisexual men by 42 per cent, when . accompanied by condoms and counseling. Last year another study found that Truvada reduced infection by 75 . percent in heterosexual couples in which one partner was infected with . HIV and the other was not. Antis: Groups including the AIDS Healthcare Foundation asked the FDA to reject the new indication, saying it could give patients a false sense of security and reduce the use of condoms . Because Truvada is on the market to manage HIV, some doctors already . prescribe it as a preventive measure. FDA approval will allow Gilead . Sciences to formally market the drug for that use, which could . dramatically increase prescribing. Truvada's groundbreaking preventive ability has exposed disagreements . about managing the disease among those in the HIV community. Groups . including the AIDS Healthcare Foundation asked the FDA to reject the new . indication, saying it could give patients a false sense of security and . reduce the use of condoms, the most reliable preventive measure against . HIV. The drug can help prevent a person becoming infected with HIV . AHF President Michael Weinstein, said: 'The FDA’s approval of Gilead’s Truvada as a form of HIV prevention today without any requirement for HIV testing is completely reckless and a move that will ultimately set back years of HIV prevention efforts.' But FDA scientists said there was no indication from . clinical trials that Truvada users were more likely to engage in risky . sexual behavior. 'What we found was that condom use increased over time and sexually . transmitted infections either remained at baseline levels or decreased,' said Dr Debra Birnkrant, FDA's director of antiviral products. 'So in . essence, we don't have any strong evidence that condoms were not used or . there was a decrease in condom use.'","Public health advocates say pill could slow spread of HIV .

An alleged gang rape involving Dominique Strauss-Kahn became the subject of a formal investigation by French prosecutors yesterday. It follows a complaint by a Belgian prostitute that she was attacked by the former head of the International Monetary Fund in a hotel room in Washington. The alleged crime is said to have taken place in December 2010 at the hotel, close to the White House. Standing together: Dominique Strauss-Khan with his wife Anne. He has become the subject of a formal investigation by French prosecutors . Described by three judges as a possible ‘gang rape’, it is expected to form vital evidence in the case against an alleged prostitution ring working out of the Carlton Hotel in Lille, northern France. Strauss-Kahn, 63, has already been charged with aggravated pimping in relation to the Carlton affair, but his legal team has argued that he could not have known that women participating in alleged orgies were prostitutes – because they were undressed. His lawyer, Henri Leclerc, said: ‘He could easily not have known, because, as you can imagine, at these kinds of parties you’re not always dressed, and I challenge you to distinguish a naked prostitute from any other naked woman.’ Prosecutors in Lille yesterday confirmed that they had opened a formal investigation into the alleged Washington gang rape. Highly paid young women working for the ring are said to have flown to the US to take part in ‘sex parties’ with Strauss-Kahn and other men at the W Hotel in Washington. Referring to Strauss-Kahn, a 25-year-old Belgian prostitute identified only as Marie-Anne S, said: ‘He used force. He was holding my hand, he pulled my hair, he hurt me. I weigh 50 kilos [about seven-and-a-half stone], he’s heavier than me.’ She claimed that Strauss-Kahn tried to force her to commit a particular sex act, adding: ‘I refused and told him no, I don’t want to. I made it clear that I did not want to, several times out loud.’ Three examining judges asked prosecutors to consider the ‘facts of the gang rape’, and a spokesman for Lille prosecutors said: ‘A formal inquiry has now begun.’ The four men under investigation for the alleged rape are Strauss-Kahn; Jean-Christophe Lagarde, a former police chief from Lille; and two businessmen, David Roquet and Fabrice Paszkowski. The latter is said to have regularly exchanged text messages with Strauss-Kahn. Roquet is said to have held Marie-Anne S by the wrists as Strauss-Kahn performed a sex act on her, and the other men are said to have ignored her pleas for help. Both women were said to be posing as secretaries and were paid £2,000 to go on the three-day trip. The rape itself is said to have taken place on December 16, with the four men and two prostitutes taking part in an orgy in a suite at the W Hotel. Scandal: Strauss-Khan is accused of attempting to rape maid Nafissatou Diallo in a New York hotel last year . Allegations: Highly-paid young women working for the ring are said to have flown to the U.S. to take part in 'sex parties' with Strauss-Kahn and other men at the W Hotel in Washington (pictured) New claims: The alleged crime is said to have taken place in December 2010 close to the White House in Washington DC (pictured) Co-accused: Former Lille police chief Jean-Christophe Lagarde is also under investigation . Another vice girl involved, identified as Aurelie D, 26, has claimed that sexual acts took place at the party, saying of Marie-Anne S: ‘I saw she did not like it. But I did not hear her say no. If she had shouted I would have heard her, and would have intervened.’ Aurelie D said she was ‘too busy’ having sex to see too much of what was going on with Marie-Anne S. Strauss-Kahn, in turn, has told police that there was ‘no brutality’ involved in the orgy under investigation. In a separate case, he has been denied diplomatic immunity from being sued over an alleged attempted rape of a New York chambermaid in May 2011. In a ruling handed down in Bronx Supreme Court, Justice Douglas McKeon threw out a motion to have the civil case dismissed, raising the prospect of a New York trial. Strauss-Kahn is accused of attempting to rape hotel employee Nafissatou Diallo, 33, at Manhattan’s Sofitel Hotel. She claims that the married Frenchman ran at her naked, molested her and forced her to perform a sex act on him after she entered his suite to clean it. The claims led to a criminal investigation against Strauss-Kahn and his house arrest in New York, but charges were dropped. The allegations meant he had to give up his political ambitions to be the Socialist candidate for the presidency of France this year. He is currently unemployed and living in Paris with his third wife, journalist and art heiress Anne Sinclair. Just over a year ago, Dominique Strauss Kahn was the favourite Socialist candidate to defeat Nicolas Sarkozy, hotly-tipped to become France's next president. However, his long and distinguished career - and world - came crashing down in the space of a few short months sparked by an allegation of rape and a subsequent string shocking revelations about his sex life. Shameful fall from grace: Dominique Strauss-Kahn . May 2011 . On May 14 last year, the then head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was arrested at JFK airport after a hotel maid told New York police she was sexually assaulted by him in his suite. The next day be was arrested and charged with a criminal sex act, attempted rape and unlawful imprisonment. He was denied bail on May 16 and held in protective custody. Strauss-Kahn's lawyer claims the forensic evidence against his client was 'not consistent with a forcible encounter' while the IMF chief himself describes his sexual encounter with the maid as 'consensual but stupid'. On May 18, DSK resigns as head of the IMF. The next day he was indicted by a grand jury and following that he was released on bail and placed under house arrest in a Manhattan apartment. July 2011 .

Mr James was fired with immediate effect during a 12-minute telephone call just two days after feeding a piece of gristle to the dog, named Merlin, at Mr Mould's country estate in Gloucestershire. Ruling: Property tycoon Raymond Mould, left, did not act reasonably in dismissing  Ivor James, right. He was sacked for feeding a piece of leftover lamb to Mr Mould's Labrador . The businessman, who also has homes in London and France, told the tribunal Mr James had been 'grossly irresponsible' in feeding a lamb bone to the Labrador, who could have been killed. But Mr James told the one-day hearing in Birmingham that Merlin, who had recently undergone surgery after eating conkers, was only given the 'fatty end' of a rack of lamb. Ruling in favour of Mr James, Judge Christopher Camp said he had no reason to doubt the account of the incident given by the claimant. Mr Mould admitted he decided to dismiss Mr James before he picked up the phone to sack him, the judge ruled, adding: 'I don't accept that it is enough to give the claimant merely an opportunity to change the decision-maker's mind.' Mr Mould also failed to speak to a housekeeper who witnessed the alleged misconduct or to conduct an adequate investigation about the incident, the judge noted. 'No reasonable employer in Mr Mould's shoes would have done this,' the judge said. Dismissed: Mr James was fired with immediate effect during a 12-minute telephone call just two days after feeding a piece of gristle to the pet Labrador. This picture of a Labrador is posed by a model . 'The claimant wasn't even given the courtesy of a face-to-face discussion. 'Simply picking up the phone and telling somebody that they are sacked is not a way any reasonable employer would behave.' Under cross-examination from Mr Mould's counsel, Sam Nicholls, Mr James conceded that he had not examined the piece of lamb in detail and it was 'possible' that it contained pieces of bone. Mr Mould told the hearing that Merlin belonged to his wife, Caroline. The tycoon, whose wealth was estimated at £60 million in 2010, estimated that his phone call to sack his driver lasted around 12 minutes. Mr Mould told the hearing: 'I was absolutely furious that he (Mr James) could have done such a thing in the light of Merlin's long-term medical history.' Mr James had been grossly irresponsible in feeding Merlin despite having knowledge of the animal's intestinal problems, which had required an operation in October 2011, Mr Mould claimed. The businessman added: 'He was perfectly well aware of what happened to the dog a month before. 'He was aware that Merlin had problems from eating conkers that had lacerated his intestine.' Mrs Mould also addressed the tribunal. She pointed out that the incident which led to the sacking had been witnessed by another member of staff. Claiming that Mr James was given comprehensive guidance on caring for and feeding her dogs, she said: 'It was grossly silly to give a lamb bone.'","Judge rules that .

Jailed: Peter Ramsey given 12 years in prison for raping and assaulting a woman after he met on the online dating website plentyoffish.com . A rapist who beat a legal secretary and left her ‘unrecognisable’ at the end of their first date was jailed for 12 years yesterday. Peter Ramsey, 26, punched the woman to the ground, ripped her clothing and raped her when she refused him a goodnight kiss at her front door. He knocked out one of her front teeth and left her with 21 injuries as he ran off with her underwear as a trophy. He was caught after using the victim’s Oyster travelcard to board a night bus within minutes of the attack in Clapham, south-west London, Inner London Crown Court heard. Judge Patricia Lees told Ramsey: ‘The gratuitous violence was wholly unnecessary. It severely aggravates the rape.’ Ramsey and the woman had spent four days chatting on the PlentyofFish.com dating site before they arranged to meet for drinks in Brixton. Ramsey was using a false name as he was cheating on his girlfriend. The victim later said: ‘He seemed like a nice guy. I thought we had a lot in common.’ They arrived at her flat in the early hours of August 27 last year but when he lent in for a kiss and she pulled back, he ‘switched’. In the communal entrance to the block, he pinned her against the wall and rained punches on her face. Ramsey met his victim on the online dating website plentyoffish.com, which claims to be 'responsible for more relationships than any other dating site', but attacked her when she refused a goodnight kiss on their first date . When she screamed he used one hand to cover her mouth and pinch her nose, while hitting her with the other fist. 'I thought I was going to die,’ she told the court. Ramsey, of no fixed address, who had been staying with friends in Forest Hill, south-east London, claimed he and the woman had consensual sex and said he did not need to rape because he could get anyone he wanted. Ramsey denied the charges but was found guilty by a jury at Inner London Crown Court in Southwark . He was convicted of rape, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and theft. Lesley Manley, defending, said Ramsey’s girlfriend had decided to stay with him and had been his only visitor in prison. Detective Constable Richard Huggins said later: ‘I would urge people using dating websites to vet the people they meet before they spend time alone.’","Attacker 'switched' when his date pulled away from a kiss .

'Grave abuse': Huntsman John Norrish arriving at Exeter Crown Court today, where he was jailed for four years for raping a drunk woman after a ball . A huntsman who raped a drunk woman after a black-tie ball was jailed for four years today. Former huntsmaster John Norrish, 68, took advantage of the 33-year-old married mother when he offered to give her a lift home in the early hours of the morning. Norrish, who has been married for 46 years and has two children, claimed she had already removed her knickers and lifted up her ball gown once they were in the vehicle. But the victim, who was a stranger, denied his claims and said she had told him she did not want to have sex. She told the court that she may have passed out in his car after downing 20 alcoholic drinks that night at the annual Tiverton Staghounds hunt ball last July at Chawleigh, Devon. Exeter crown court heard Norrish raped her in the front seat of his 4x4 at around 2.30am. A jury took more than eleven hours of deliberations before finding Norrish, 68, guilty of rape by a majority of ten to two. The trial judge, Mr Justice Field, said it was a 'grave abuse of a vulnerable woman', adding that the 'effect of what you did will endure for her for years'. After the case, the victim told how she had been 'violated in the most horrendous way'. She said: 'I would like to say that this has been the most difficult ten months of my life. 'A community has been divided and I would like to think that we can now put this behind us and rebuild our lives. 'John Norrish was seen as an upstanding member of the community and he abused that trust. 'This result means that no-one else will be subjected to this type of abuse from him.' There were gasps and tears in the packed public gallery from friends of Norrish who had attended the court every day for his trial. He had his head bowed as the judge told him: 'It was in the early hours of July 2 last year when you invited the victim to take a lift home with you. She was drunk. 'I have no doubt that you appreciated that. Instead of simply giving her a lift home as you should have done, you took advantage of her as she sat in the front passenger seat of your car. Took advantage: Norrish (pictured on a hunt, left) raped his victim in the front seat of his 4x4 car at 2.30am after offering to give her a lift home from the annual Tiverton Staghounds hunt ball last July . 'I would like to say that this has been the most difficult ten months of my life. Not only have I been violated in the most horrendous way, I have suffered emotional trauma as a result of this. A community has been divided and I would like to think that we can now put this behind us and rebuild our lives. I am relieved that this has been brought to a positive conclusion and I can now start to move on and deal with the emotional trauma that this has caused myself and my family. John Norrish was seen as an upstanding member of the community and he abused that trust. This result means that no one else will be subjected to this type of abuse from him.' 'She did not consent to your advances, early on she told she did not want to. 'You did not reasonably believe that she was consenting and proceeded to have sexual intercourse. This was a grave abuse of a vulnerable woman.' The judge said the victim was 'too drunk to exercise a free choice to events'. Norrish remained impassive as the sentence of four years was passed, of which he will serve half behind bars before he is considered for released on licence. His victim was said to be 'beside herself with relief' at the jury verdict and thanked her husband, friends and the police for their ‘support and professionalism'. She said that after the rape she ran from his car and spotting a car’s lights in the field used for parking - it was a car carrying her husband who had gone to fetch it to give her a lift home. She said she was 'hysterical' and her husband wanted to track down Norrish who drove off with her shoes, knickers and handbag in the footwell of his vehicle. Forceful: The 67-year-old former huntsmaster (front) was told by his victim that she did not want to have sex with him, Exeter Crown Court heard . Norrish, 68, is married with two grown-up sons . People working at the ball said they saw the woman after the alleged attack and she appeared calm and was only concerned about a bottle of wine which had been stored in a fridge at the bar. Det Con Paul Feeney said: 'She is beside herself with relief at the jury’s decision and now wants to get her head around it.' Norrish, who has no previous convictions, has a caution for an assault during a hunt altercation. His lawyer Robert Linford told the judge that his client had led an outdoor lifestyle all his life and a custodial sentence will be hard for him to bear. Norrish, who is now retired from is job as huntsman with the Tiverton Staghounds, is still married. He will be placed on the Sex Offenders’ register for life. Norrish was described by one of the people serving behind the fully stocked bar as 'the star of the show' that night. It was said he stood proudly at the entrance to the Cobley Farm event wearing his red hunting jacket, collecting tickets off the 300-400 people who were attending the Tiverton Staghounds ball last July. Norrish, who has two grown-up sons, was a big part of the West Country hunting scene. During his lengthy career, which dated back to the 1980s, he had been associated with the Devon and Somerset Staghounds, the south Devon foxhounds, the Minehead harriers in Somerset and latterly the Tiverton Staghounds. He lived at the kennels where he looked after the hounds that took part in the hunting over Exmoor.","John Norrish, 68, convicted after taking advantage of married mother .

A British woman is fighting for her life after falling 80ft from the balcony of her holiday hotel room in Majorca. Chantelle Serginson, 24, plunged from the sixth floor after a row with her mother Kimberley, according to police sources. She suffered multiple head and leg fractures and last night was in a critical condition in hospital. Plunge: Police sources said Chantelle, right, fell from the balcony following an argument with her mother Kimberley, left . Pole girl: Chantelle at a pole dancing called Red Velvet . Motorbike girl: Chantelle posted the picture on Facebook. She is in a critical condition in hospital . The life-threatening accident is the latest devastating event to strike a family plagued with tragedy. It comes six years after Kimberley had her throat slashed in front of her daughter during an horrific knife attack at her home and almost 13 years since she lost a seven-year-old daughter Katie to a brain tumour in 1999. Chantelle, from Middlesbrough, was on holiday in the party resort of Magaluf with her mother and sister Jessica, 15, when this latest incident happened at the three-star Hotel Marina Barracuda at about 6pm on Friday. A source at the Civil Guard police said: ‘We are treating this as a tragic accident. In hospital: Chantelle Serginson posted these glamout pictures on Facebook . ‘Witnesses have  told us that Chantelle was rowing with  her mother in  the hotel room. ‘She went out on to the balcony and for some reason climbed up on the railing. ‘We believe she lost her balance and fell, landing on a first floor balcony below. We do not believe that she threw herself off intentionally.’ Three Britons have fallen to their deaths from hotels in Magaluf in the past six weeks. In 2006 Kimberley, 44 today, had her throat cut by neighbour Mark Smorthwaite. He was jailed indefinitely for wounding with intent. Speaking after the sentencing, the hairdresser, who was 38 at the time, spoke of the devastation the attack had caused the family. Devastating: The family were on holiday in the party resort of Magaluf when the incident happened at the three-star Hotel Marina Barracuda at about 6pm on Friday . ‘Me and my daughter were watching the television and saw someone getting their throat cut. Even though you know it's fictional I felt sick to my stomach because you know what it really feels like. ‘I have flashbacks and dreams. Sometimes it's not even him doing it. You just hope that in time they will go away,’ she told the Middlesbrough Evening Gazette. During the trial Teesside jury were told how Smorthwaite, who lived over the road from Mrs Serginson in Park End, had stormed over ‘fuming with anger’, brandishing a knife and sliced the blade across her neck. Mrs Serginson required extensive plastic surgery to allow the deep wound to heal.","Police sources say they are treating the incident as a 'tragic accident'

Jake Simkins’ parachute became tangled on the cliff face while he was base-jumping on a Greek island. The 41-year-old called his girlfriend, who is almost seven months pregnant, at a nearby hotel to raise the alarm. Terror: Jake Simkins is stuck up the cliff 180ft off the ground.

A Greek worker who was alongside Anita contacted the emergency services, but fire crews failed to reach Mr Simkins. The woman, who did not want to be named, said: ‘He was speaking to her constantly and letting her know he was okay. ‘He was calm, and they were even joking. Jake asked for the emergency services to throw him a rope, so he could climb down. ‘Surely three hours was enough time for the fire service to find a rope and get it to him?’ Tragic: Jake Simkins died after crashing into a cliff after a base jump went wrong on the Greek island of Zante .

Well turned out: Rebekah Brooks wore a navy pencil skirt suit with a green scarf and black Christian Louboutin heels as she arrived at Westminster Magistrates Court . She click-clacked into court with her husband at her side before her four-inch heels fell silent on the drab carpet tiles. The shoes were by Christian Louboutin. The charges were by the Crown Prosecution Service. Rebekah Brooks, formerly one of the most powerful women in Rupert Murdoch’s empire, took a place in the dock yesterday to face allegations that she conspired to pervert the course of justice in the phone hacking scandal. Across London in another court, millions of pounds worth of lawyers ground solemnly through another day of the Leveson Inquiry, at which Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg gave evidence. Here in the majesty of Westminster Magistrates’ court, day one of Regina versus Mrs Brooks and others was more like a film premiere. True, they didn’t roll out the red carpet for the 44-year-old former tabloid editor when the first glimpse of those red-sole shoes and nude fishnet tights emerged from the door of a taxi. But the flame-haired ex-News International chief executive was certainly the star of the several-yard walk through a corridor of TV crews and photographers calling her name. Non-celebrity defendants stood silently on the pavement as husband Charlie Brooks, an Old Etonian friend of David Cameron, was whisked past the masses. Upstairs, two QCs and a couple of high-profile solicitors were already in Court One to represent Mr and Mrs Brooks and the four other defendants appearing with them. ‘What a star-studded cast,’ remarked district judge Howard Riddle as the eminent lawyers’ names were disclosed. Back in the old days, in the court this new building replaced, the case list included the likes of John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull. Yesterday Mrs Brooks’s name featured alongside Latvian and Polish extradition cases. The hearing might have lasted only eight minutes, but it still provided an element of legal theatre. Tourists stopped to take photographs and at least two entered the public gallery for Act One of what is likely to be a lengthy legal battle. The Crown regards this simply as due process. Mrs Brooks and her husband have famously branded it a ‘witch hunt’. ‘All stand’, said a voice from the Bench, and six defendants sprang up from their seats. They folded their hands in front of them in the manner of schoolchildren appearing before the headmaster. The entourage: (Left to right) security consultant Daryl Jorsling, ex-NI security chief Mark Hanna, chauffeur Paul Edwards, ex-PA Cheryl Carter, Rebekah and Charlie Brooks. All face charges of conspiracy . Say cheese! Mr and Mrs Brooks appeared relaxed as they left the court, smiling for photographers . The PA: Cheryl Carter leaves Westminster Magistrates' Court. She is charged with one count of conspiracy . Rebekah Brooks wore a navy pencil skirt suit cut above the knee for the hearing at Southwark Crown Court today. The 44-year-old accessorised with a £200 Alexander McQueen skull-print olive green scarf that oozed defiance and set off her flame-red hair to great effect. The outfit reflected the confidence in her smile, and she wore a low-cut camisole under her tailored jacket. She finished off the designer look with black Christian Louboutin court shoes, underlining her sense of style as well as her wealth from a stellar career at News International. Mrs Brooks wore a navy suit with a pencil skirt. She adjusted her green silk scarf and clutched a hefty handbag. Mr Brooks, a 49-year-old racehorse . trainer, snatched a glance at his wife before they were all asked for . their names, dates of birth and addresses. The Brooks’ address in . Churchill, Oxfordshire, was given in full detail. Alongside them stood members of Mrs . Brooks’ former entourage – personal assistant Cheryl Carter, 48, from . Chelmsford, Essex; chauffeur Paul Edwards, 47, of Bethnal Green, east . London; security consultant Daryl Jorsling, 39, from Aldershot, . Hampshire and News International security chief Mark Hanna, 49, from . Buckingham.

She is accused of removing boxes of . material from the News International archive and allegedly trying to . conceal documents, computers and other items from Operation Weeting, .

The comment is thought to play on lyrics from LA-based rappers Black Knights who sang ‘It ain’t safe out on these streets’. Although she swore off using Twitter she has now defended her use of it to air grievances as the ‘only recourse’. After public spats on the social networking site, the couple released a joint statement on Friday saying they regretted saying things in public that should have been kept private, adding: ‘There will be no further comment.’ However, in fresh tweets yesterday, Mrs Goldsmith lashed out at Daily Mail writer Janet Street Porter who had criticised the Twitter war in an article entitled: ‘Why this modern compulsion to let it all hang out makes my skin crawl.’ Street Porter said Mrs Goldsmith was invading her own privacy by tweeting about her marriage. Attack: Sister-in-law Jemima Khan . In a fresh twist, her comments appeared to have been prompted by tweets about the Street Porter article from socialite Jemima Khan – her husband’s sister. Mrs Khan wrote: ‘In the same article about the need for privacy (a fair point) she [Street Porter] also outs her own Mum as an adulterer for good measure. #hypocrisy.’ A freelance journalist Sarah Standing joined in, tweeting: ‘Oh that article made me so angry, what bull****’ At which point, Mrs Goldsmith posted: ‘Me too...and re her condemnation of me ‘‘taking’’ to twitter to air grievances as I did she publishes her views and opinions ad nauseam. ‘With the luxury of not having them twisted and magimixed by the press. Twitter is the only recourse for most.’ Mrs Goldsmith, 30, had been branded ‘appalling’ by her 31-year-old husband for her behaviour since she began a relationship with Electronica. The New Orleans rapper, whose real name is Timothy Elpadaro Thedford, is currently staying in a £1.8million penthouse apartment in Knightsbridge, a short distance from Mrs Goldsmith’s £20million marital home in Kensington. Mrs Goldsmith, claimed her ‘life had been saved’ by the rap artist, who she manages through her own record label, Roundtable Records. She also appeared to accuse her husband of cheating on her before the couple issued their statement. Yesterday Mr Goldsmith was keeping quiet about the split – and his only tweet was about how ‘solar power would be the lowest cost energy option’ in the US by 2015.

They had expected to spend their Las Vegas honeymoon indulging in romantic meals, lounging by the pool and taking in the sights. Instead, Nicola and Alex Hamill spent their first few days as husband and wife confined to their hotel room with a severe bout of food poisoning – caused by the pâté they had eaten at their Hertfordshire wedding reception. And to make matters worse, when they returned home after five miserable days of diarrhoea and stomach cramps, they discovered 49 of their guests had also fallen ill. Newlyweds Alex and Nicola Hamill were confined to their honeymoon bedroom after they both fell sick with food poisoning along with 49 of their guests . Two of the portions of the undercooked pâté that were served up to guests at the Hamill's wedding . Mr Hamill’s brother-in-law was so poorly he lost a stone and a half and was bedridden for two weeks. The four-star hotel where the couple held their wedding has now been fined £8,300 after health and safety officers took it to court for undercooking the chicken liver pâté served as a starter. ‘We feel it spoilt the memory of the day. We had saved for years for our special day. It was ruined,’ Mrs Hamill said. Health experts have warned in the past of the high risk of food poisoning from undercooked chicken or duck liver pâté. New . figures show that more than 90 per cent of outbreaks of campylobacter - . the most common form of bacterial food poisoning - at catering venues . in 2011 were linked to people eating the pâté. Symptoms of the illness include diarrhoea, stomach pains, cramps, fever, and generally feeling unwell. According to the Health Protection Agency (HPA), there were 18 outbreaks of campylobacter infection in England so far this year. Overall, 443 people became unwell and one person was taken to hospital. Campylobacter . can be found spread throughout chicken and duck liver, meaning it must . be cooked thoroughly to ensure the bacteria is killed. A . total of 14 outbreaks occurred in catering venues, 13 of which were . linked to chicken or duck liver pâté. Chicken was the worst culprit, . accounting for 11 of the 13 cases. The outbreaks occurred across the country, with seven linked to wedding receptions held at hotels, banqueting venues and pubs. The other six were linked to catering in hotels, clubs and restaurants. ‘I would not wish it on my worst enemy. I feel so embarrassed. When we got back from the honeymoon we realised everyone was ill. ‘No one had wanted to tell us while we were away in case it ruined our honeymoon.’ The couple, from Luton, tied the knot on September 3 last year at Letchworth Hall Hotel in Hertfordshire. They paid £5,550 for a wedding breakfast and drinks for their 118 guests, having carefully saved up £16,000 for the ceremony and honeymoon. Mrs Hamill, 29, a merchandiser, said she and Mr Hamill, a 32-year-old electrician, fell in love with the hotel when they first saw it, and staff ‘really bigged up the kitchen and food’. But when they sat down to eat on the big day, Mrs Hamill said she was immediately suspicious about the pâté. ‘What is worse is that I knew something was wrong with the pâté – it looked completely different from our tasting session,’ she said. ‘We asked the staff twice to check it was fit for consumption and they assured us it was.’ The next day the couple complained about the pâté, and the hotel gave them £400 towards the bar bill. On September 5 they flew to Las Vegas for their honeymoon, which had cost £2,200. But the newlyweds only enjoyed one romantic meal together before they both fell ill with stomach cramps and diarrhoea. For the rest of their five-day stay they were too ill to leave their room, and could only manage dry toast and water. Mrs Hamill said: ‘People ask us what we did in Las Vegas and we have to say nothing. ‘We were left just looking out of the window thinking we wish we were sat by the pool…I felt so ill. At one point I thought I was going to die. Managers at Letchworth Hall Hotel has apologised to Mr and Mrs Hamill and their guests . When they returned from their honeymoon, the couple were devastated to hear that nearly half of their wedding guests had suffered from the same food poisoning . 'All we could eat was dry toast and we spent $150 [£97] on the mini bar just on water and vitamin drinks. We should have been splashing out on champagne.’ When they flew home on September 10, they discovered the situation was even worse than they thought. Forty-nine guests, all of whom had chosen the pâté, were also ill, and Mrs Hamill’s sister had called in environmental health officers. The case was prosecuted by North Hertfordshire District Council and the hotel pleaded guilty to two charges of poor food hygiene practice at Hertford Magistrates’ Court on May 18. Doctors confirmed 22 cases of Campylobacter food poisoning, including those of Mr and Mrs Hamill. Mr and Mrs Hamill pictured with both sets of parents - they didn't get food poisoning as they chose soup instead of the pâté . The hotel was fined £6,300 for the first offence and £2,000 for the second. It was also made to pay the council the full court costs of £3,870. Environmental health officers discovered that the chef had only cooked the chicken livers for the pâté to 60°C (140°F), breaching hotel policy and Food Standards Agency guidance, which recommend heating to 75C (167F) to prevent food poisoning. The hotel was told to improve its service and in a repeat inspection on May 8 it received a five out of five rating for food hygiene standards. A spokesman said: ‘Letchworth Hall Hotel wishes to express its deep regret and offer its sincere apologies to Mr and Mrs Hamill and their wedding guests. ‘This incident was unprecedented in our past of catering to countless similar large events, a fact also reflected in our recent receipt of a five star food hygiene rating.’ The Hamills have instructed lawyers to sue the hotel for negligence. They will ask for compensation for loss of earnings as well as for their ruined wedding day and honeymoon.","Chicken liver pâté was undercooked when it was served to guests .

"London borough has had a . £52m cut in funding for 2011 to 2013 . By . Nick Enoch . PUBLISHED: . 04:38 EST, 4 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:14 EST, 4 June 2012 . A family living on benefits is being moved to a £1.8 million townhouse - which is being renovated for them at the taxpayers' expense - provoking outrage. Islington council is converting the four-storey Grade II-listed property into one house after it had been split into two flats. If rented privately the council-owned property could earn around £2,000 a week but when the family move in after the renovation - which itself will cost thousands - they will be paying less than £1,000 a month. The Indian couple, believed to be in their 30s, with four children and another on the way, are said to be amazed by their luck. Islington council is converting this £1.8m property into one house after it had been split into two flats. An Indian couple on benefits will move in and pay less than £1,000 in rent. It could have brought in £2,000 in the private sector . The London borough has had a £52m cut in funding for 2011 to 2013 - and locals want the property in Granville Square, Clerkenwell, to be sold to raise money . And they'll certainly enjoy the run of their new home, in Granville Square, Clerkenwell in north London - once part of the former borough of Finsbury. The five-bedroom Victorian residence has a games room on the top floor, a huge living room, three bathrooms, fitted kitchen, a 40ft garden - and access to a residents-only play area including a basketball court. One neighbour, Kelly Gladwell, 40, told . the Sun: 'It's disgusting. The council should sell it off privately and . build several homes for people who really need them.' Another resident, Dolores Murphy, 63, . added: 'We were all surprised the council was giving a family the whole . house. I have four daughters, all born in Islington, who had to move . out of London to afford rent. It's so unfair.' The London borough has had a £52million cut in funding for 2011 to 2013 - and locals want the property to be sold in order to raise money. Meanwhile, the soon-to-be-housed couple have been making regular visits to monitor progress on their new home. A builder working on site said the family was delighted and couldn't believe their good fortune. Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers' Alliance told the paper: 'It's barmy for the council to spend so much just so one family can live there. It should focus on providing affordable housing.' A spokesman for Islington Council told the Daily Express: 'This particular property has been allocated to an Islington family who are currently severely overcrowded. 'All of our available council properties are advertised online so anyone in need of a council home can apply.' In contrast to the case above, where the council has charged the couple a relatively modest London rental rate, there have been several instances in recent years where properties owned by private landlords have been used to house families on benefits - at a great cost to taxpayers... A mother of eight told of her ‘great’ life in a £2.6million home funded by taxpayers. Francesca Walker receives more than £90,000 a year in benefits to pay the rent on the five-bed villa, plus other payouts. She insisted she would rather live in a normal council house, but added: ‘I’m not going to pretend this isn’t great.’ Mother of eight Francesca Walker was placed in a £2.6m house in Notting Hill, west London at the taxpayers' expense . Miss Walker, 33, has Tory leader David Cameron, actor Hugh Grant and Four Weddings writer Richard Curtis as neighbours in fashionable Notting Hill, West London. Her four-storey home boasts five bedrooms, three bathrooms, a double living room, study and roof terrace. Speaking in 2009, Miss Walker said: ‘All my life I’ve lived in overcrowded flats on estates with gangs that kicked our door in and harassed my children. ‘We lived in some hellholes. One stank so badly we couldn’t use two rooms. Another had a gas leak that made my children ill.’ Miss Walker, whose children range from five to 16, was given the house because a new rule introduced by the Government in April forces Kensington and Chelsea council to fund suitable homes for large families. None of the available council houses was big enough, so the local authority pays for her to rent from a private landlord. Miss Walker admitted the move had caused ‘a lot of jealousy’. A single mother with three children was placed by her local council in a £1.5million mews house four years ago. The luxurious three-storey property, in the heart of London's exclusive Kensington, costs an astonishing £1,125 a week to rent - a cost being met by housing benefit, at taxpayers' expense. Appalled neighbours said the house concerned is the biggest on the central yet quiet street. Boston Ivy climbs its walls, and it features a juliet balcony and a large garage.

More than 100 families on benefits are living in luxury homes . More than 11,000 households are raking . in benefits that are at least the equivalent of a higher rate . taxpayers’ £47,000 salary, it was revealed last month. The . figure was disclosed by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith . before letters were sent to households explaining a new cap on . benefits under which no one can claim more than the average annual . working wage of £26,000. The . cap comes into force next April and aims to remove the disincentive to . work that leaves many of the unemployed better off on benefits. According to official figures, at . least 100 families on benefits are living in luxury homes, with many . receiving housing handouts of about £5,000 per month – enough to fund a . £1million mortgage. Households . exempt from the cap include those where there are  people in work and . claiming working tax credits, and families that are deemed to be very . vulnerable – including war widows and those claiming disability living . allowance. People who . have lost their job but were employed for 12 months or more prior to . claiming benefits will have nine months’ grace before the cap applies. Jonathan . Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Many taxpayers struggling to . make ends meet will find it incredibly unfair that some people are . drawing more in benefits than they’ve ever actually earned themselves. ‘The . welfare system needs to provide a safety net for the poorest and most . vulnerable in society, but these figures demonstrate that the current . system has got out of control and that the Government’s proposed . benefits cap needs to be introduced as a matter of urgency.’ The . Prime Minister has also said it is ‘time to call time’ on excessive . benefits. David Cameron said in January: ‘It’s a basic issue of . fairness. Should people really be able to earn more than £26,000 just . through benefits alone? ‘I don’t believe they should. And I think the overwhelming majority of people in the country would back that view.’ Ministers . will overhaul the tax and benefits system from October next year, when a . universal credit will be introduced to simplify the system and replace . swathes of tax credits and benefits. They . claim it will ensure that no one will be better off on benefits than in . work, removing the so-called ‘cliff edge’ where those who take on . part-time work end up worse off as benefits are removed. But . critics have warned that families affected by the benefits cap could . lose their homes, as around 44 per cent of those set to be hit are . living in social housing. David . Orr, of the National Housing Federation, said: ‘The letters will come . as a shock to many vulnerable families. The overall benefit cap is a . crude measure that fails to reflect the stark differences in housing . costs across the country caused by the desperate shortage of affordable . housing.’ He called on . councils to share information they had on who could be affected so that . housing associations could offer help. ‘With under a year to go before . many people start losing their homes, there’s no time to lose,’ he . added. Mr . Duncan Smith said: ‘For more than ten years Labour let the benefits . bill soar, and these figures show the scale of the problem. ‘It is absurd that people are able to claim as much on benefits as a higher rate taxpayer earns. ‘The welfare state should work as a safety net and then support people to financial independence. 'Our . welfare reforms will make sure a life in work always pays more than a . life on benefits, and are a clear illustration that this Government is . on the side of people who work hard, do the right thing and aspire to a . better life.’ The 11,000 households exposed by Mr . Duncan Smith enjoy benefits of more than £34,000 a year, equating to a . gross wage of £47,000. This is enough to put most employees into the . higher rate 40p tax band.","Islington council renovating Grade II-listed residence for Indian couple .

Their bitter spat over Britain joining the euro led Tony Blair to describe Gordon Brown as ‘crackerjack’, it emerged yesterday. The then Prime Minister regarded his Chancellor – and rival – as ‘brilliant’ but ‘bonkers’, according to former Labour spin-doctor Alastair Campbell. In the latest extracts from his diaries, covering 2001 to 2003, Mr Campbell said distrust and loathing between the pair  plummeted to the point where Downing Street believed Mr Brown was ‘hell-bent’ on the Prime Minister’s destruction. At loggerheads: Former Prime Minister Tony Blair thought his successor Gordon Brown was 'bonkers' and a 'malign force' that was 'hell-bent' on his destruction, according to the latest extracts from Alastair Campbell's diaries . Many of their arguments centred on Britain joining the single currency. A 2003 entry records pro-euro Mr Blair . saying after an acrimonious meeting with Mr Brown: ‘One thing is for . sure. At the moment he is crackerjack.’ In June that year, the Chancellor . announced that Britain had not passed the five tests he had set to . assess whether Britain should join the euro. The following day Mr Campbell asked the Prime Minister how long it would take to remove the obstacles to the euro. Mr Blair replied: ‘The best way would be to get out a gun, shoot the obstacle and then have a reshuffle. ‘[TB] was no longer in any doubt that . GB was still slowing it down deliberately. [Mr Blair said]: “It’s the . dead hand, the paralysis of progress.” Then a chat with [TB] and GB on . the euro. You could tell from his confident body language that GB was . where he wanted to be.’ The latest extracts from Mr Campbell's Downing Street diaries shine a light on the tension and bitterness behind the scenes during Mr Blair's decade in office . An entry 24 hours later said: ‘Things . just hadn’t worked on the euro and TB was pretty fed up... the judgment . was settling that GB had basically thwarted him.’ In the fourth, and final, volume of . his Downing Street diaries, Mr Campbell reveals more details of . relentless feuds between the two men at the heart of the last Labour . government. In an entry for September 2002, Mr Campbell said Mr Blair . felt a ‘dark cloud of GB (Gordon Brown) over him’ the whole time. ‘[TB] . said GB was getting desperate and now was acting as a destructive . force.’ Mr Campbell, the Number 10 director of . communications, and the inspiration behind the claim in 1998 that Mr . Brown had ‘psychological flaws’, said Mr Blair told him: ‘He’s brilliant . and ambitious but he’s also bonkers and I just can’t be bothered with . it.’ The extracts also indicate Mr Campbell . suspected the Chancellor and his aides of briefing against the Prime . Minister, contradicting evidence Mr Brown gave to the Leveson Inquiry . last week when he denied plotting against Mr Blair. What the diaries say.jpg . In November 2002 relations between Mr . Blair and Mr Brown, who succeeded him in 2007, sank further, with Mr . Campbell writing: ‘TB said if people knew the truth about how GB treats . him, they would be appalled. He felt GB was trying to push him into . trying to get rid of him, and he would then seek to mount a challenge.’ Four days later: ‘I think the general . feeling now, not just in Number 10 but around the cabinet table too, was . that GB was pretty hell-bent on TB’s destruction.’ Later that month: . ‘TB said he now accepted GB was a largely malign force.’ In January 2003, when Mr Campbell . asked the Prime Minister what he was going to do about his ‘friend next . door’, Mr Blair said: ‘I’m going to sack him. The next month, after a . meeting with Mr Brown and Ed Balls on the euro, Mr Blair said the . situation ‘was the worst yet’. The diary reads: ‘[TB] said GB talked to . him like he was a five-year-old.’ On April 4, after another angry . meeting between the pair on the euro, the Downing St spin doctor wrote: . ‘TB and I went out on the terrace later. “One thing is sure,” he said. “At the moment he is crackerjack. My big worry is he will bring the . whole show down.” ’ The following month: ‘He said he and . GB were in a different league to the rest of the Cabinet... GB was the . only one who got anywhere near him in terms of ability, which was why he . still felt he had to be next. But he couldn’t see a way out. ‘He felt if they fell out terminally, and he felt he had to get rid of him, that was the nuclear option.’","Blair planned to sack Brown in January 2003 .

Hours after news surfaced that she would be fired next month as co-host of NBC's Today show, Ann Curry wasn't even expected at work. Reports surfaced late Wednesday  that Curry, who took over the anchor chair June 9, 2011, would be removed from her spot as Matt Lauer's cohost before the network's Olympic coverage begins next month. But on Thursday morning, rather than calling in sick or skipping work, she was back next to Lauer as though nothing was amiss. Like nothing happened: Ann Curry (left) sat with co-hosts Al Rocker, Matt Lauer and one of her possible replacements, Natalie Morales (right) on Thursday morning as though nothing was the matter . Support: Fans tweeted their support for Curry after she sent out this innocuous message on Thursday morning. Her name became the number one trending topic on Twitter . The New York Times reported that NBC executives were preparing for Curry not to show up on Thursday. On Wednesday it was reported she would be gone from her role before the Summer Olympics begin July 27. NBC has the rights to air the Olympics and the whole show will be anchored from London. On Wednesday, Today show producers contacted Hoda Kotb, who co-hosts the fourth hour of the program, and told her to be ready to go on the air at 7am. But Curry, who reportedly makes $2 million a year, was there, acting like normal. 'Good morning Twitterverse,' she tweeted to her 1.2 million followers on Thursday. 'Good morning. From hot to hotter. You thought yesterday was a scorcher? In many places in the East today, it’s going to get even hotter,' she said at the opening of the show. Curry has taken . the blame from many at NBC for the Today show's ratings decline. The . program lost the top spot among network morning shows this spring, a . position it had held, unbroken, since 1995. Part of the problem is a lack of chemistry with Lauer, who had great on-air chemistry with Curry's predecessors Katie Couric and Meredith Vieira. Possible replacements: Savannah Guthrie (left) and Natalie Morales (right) are both on the show now and are being considered to take over Curry's anchor chair when she leaves it . While NBC won the months of April and May for the morning slot against ABC, multiple weeks they lost to Good Morning America. One week in April broke the 16 year winning streak, and the week of May 21 Today lost to their rival by 33,000. Later in Thursday's program she appeared . alongside Lauer, Al Roker and Natalie Morales -- one of the women who . has been mentioned as her possible replacement. Her 'good morning 'tweet, sent out about 8am, received dozens of responses from her fans, who offered her their support. 'To know just how professional @AnnCurry is, she's been faultless co-hosting @todayshow this morning. Despite all the pressure. #ClassAct,' CNN interviewer Piers Morgan tweeted. The flurry made Ann Curry the top trending phrase on Twitter Thursday morning. Curry didn't respond to any of her supporters. Curry has been criticized for not being as flexible or quite as quick-witted as Lauer or Couric, who had the hosting job for 15 years before leaving in 2006. Curry took over as co-anchor from Meredith Vieira one year ago. Vieira has continued to contribute to Today since leaving. She reported from London for the Jubilee earlier this month, pictured, and will also be going to cover the Olympics. She could return as anchor . Couric was replaced by Vieira. Lauer, who recently received a reported $30 million annual contract to stay at NBC is reportedly one of the people working to push Curry out. NBC producers are beginning to panic as ABC's Good Morning America has begun trading off with the Today show for the top network morning show. Curry's more prominent role in the morning show has received the blame for this slump. Negotiations are currently underway with network executives to move Curry into a new job, likely as a foreign correspondent. But, she's apparently not leaving without a fight. 'She got her dream job, and she doesn’t want to let it go,' a source told the Times. Savannah Guthrie, who co-hosts the . show's third hour, is at the top of the list of Curry's possible . replacements. Natalie . Morales, Today's news anchor, and Meredith Vieira, who left the co-host . role last year, have been mentioned in talks for the position, news . outlets reported. Vieira has remained involved with NBC. In addition to Today co-hosting duties from London during the Queen's Jubillee, she will also be contributing from the upcoming Summer Olympics for the network. However, TMZ reported on Thursday she had been offered and refused to return. Later on Thursday morning's show Curry was on Rockefeller plaza with her cohosts for an interview with Michael Phelps mother . A decision about her departure from the show could be made before the Summer Olympics begins in later this summer. Several staff members who work on the . show have blamed Curry as the reason for the decline in ratings after . she took over the co-host job, according to the New York Times. Curry could return to her foreign correspondent roots after she leaves the anchor seat . Since then, Today and Good Morning America have been . trading wins. Some reports suggest the longtime member of the Today show may become a foreign correspondent at the network. For Curry, however, the reality of ending her time on the program has been difficult. Attorney Robert B Barnett is representing Curry in the discussions. The lawyer is known for having represented Christiane Amanpour in her talks with ABC as she left the news program This Week. Curry began . working as news anchor for the Today show in 1997, a position she held . onto until she was promoted to share the hosting role with Lauer. She has an extensive background in global reporting. Curry began a career at NBC in 1990 as part of the NBC News team.","Took over as Matt Lauer's co-anchor from Meredith Vieira in June 2011 .

Claims: Shafilea Ahmed's teacher saw injuries which the teenager claimed were caused in a 'beating' from her parents, a court heard today. The teenager is pictured . Shafilea Ahmed’s teacher saw injuries which the teenager claimed were caused in a 'beating' from her parents, a court heard today. Joanne Code said Shafilea also ran away from home and said she would not go back because 'they are going to marry me off in Pakistan'. The teenager’s parents, Iftikhar, 52, and Farzana, 49, are accused of murdering Shafilea at home in Warrington, Cheshire, in September 2003. Mrs Code, who taught Shafilea German at Great Sankey High School, told the jury at Chester Crown Court the teenager was a 'very, very good student'. She said: 'She was a very quiet young lady who didn’t draw attention to herself but by the same token quite a gifted German student.' Later, in September 2002, Mrs Code was head of sixth form when Shafilea began her A Levels. The teacher said she was 'always immaculately dressed, he hair was always straight, no make up on and her uniform was pristine. 'Shafilea was very, very clear she wanted to be a barrister - that was her dream, that was her ambition. 'She spoke really articulately about wanting to be a barrister and going into the field of law. 'She was exceptionally keen to go to university, she was adamant that was what she wanted to do.' Little more than a month after she joined the sixth form, Shafilea was absent from school and Mrs Code telephoned the family home and spoke to Mr Ahmed. She told the jury she was 'surprised' when he said Shafilea wanted to leave college and 'burn her books'. 'It really did not stack up at all with the student that I knew and her aspirations for what she wanted to be,' she added. The teacher asked to speak directly to Shafilea, who was put on the phone and told only to answer 'yes' or 'no'. Mrs Code added: 'I was concerned that if she said too much it might make life difficult for her. It was a very direct question I needed to ask her, I asked whether or not I needed to be worried about her welfare - which she replied ""Yes"".' The teacher asked for Mr Ahmed to return to the phone and informed him Shafilea needed to sign papers before she was allowed to leave her studies. The next day the teenager returned to school and went to see Mrs Code. In the dock: The teenager's parents, Iftikhar, 52, right, and Farzana, 49, left, are accused of murdering Shafilea at home in Warrington, Cheshire, in September 2003 . 'She came in and she had bruising to her neck and a cut on her lip,' the teacher said. She added: 'She told me her mother and father had beat her and that they had taken it in turns to do so while one held her down and then vice versa. 'She said it happened prior to being stopped coming into school (when) her parents had found out she had been texting boys.' Shafilea disappeared in September 2003 and her body was found on the bank of the River Kent in Cumbria the following February. The prosecution claim she was killed by her parents because of her 'Western' ways. The teacher said Shafilea was 'adamant' she did not want social services to become involved but the situation was monitored. Shafilea did remain at Great Sankey High but the following month ran away from home. She was found 'shivering' in a park by a friend who took her into school. Mrs Code said a meeting was arranged with social services in which Shafilea said she was 'hopeful' that she could be reconciled with her parents. 'Shafilea was frightened and she was concerned about her brother and sisters,' Mrs Code added. 'She was worried about what would happen to them. It always came back to her brothers and sisters.' In a further meeting, this time involving her parents, Shafilea spoke 'quite openly' about her lack of freedom, the court heard. 'It was a very frank meeting,' Mrs Code said. A teacher at Sankey High School said Shafilea was 'adamant' she did not want social services to become involved but the situation was monitored . Family home: The Ahmeds lived in this house in Warrington, Cheshire. Shafilea's remains were discovered in Cumbria in 2004 . 'More to do with the freedom of a young girl effectively wanting the same freedom as her friends, to be able to work and have money and go out. 'By the end of the meeting Mr Ahmed had agreed she would be allowed more freedom and she seemed happy with it.' But the following February Mrs Code said she learned that the teenager had run away again, this time to Blackburn, to be with a man called 'Mushi'. Mrs Code said she was very concerned about Shafilea going to Blackburn with an older man she hardly knew. She added: 'That was the point everything turned for me. 'She said she wasn’t going home and when I asked why, she said, ""They’re going to marry me off in Pakistan"". 'She point-blank refused to go home.' Mrs Code said Shafilea wanted to deal with her situation by presenting herself as homeless to the local authority. The teacher said she drove her student to the relevant organisations and bed and breakfast accommodation was found. During the car journey, the teacher said Shafilea told her: 'Miss, I’m going to have an arranged marriage and I’m not coming back from Pakistan.' Henry Riding, for the prosecution, asked Mrs Code if Shafilea mentioned an 'intended suitor'. The teacher said: 'She didn’t mention anybody or a specific person. I got the impression she was being taken out there and that would happen while she was out there. 'She was very clear she was going to be married in Pakistan and she was not coming home.' Shafilea spent several days at the B&B until a flat was found for her, the court heard. But on her last day in the temporary accommodation, an incident took place as Shafilea was walking to school with a friend and Mrs Code called the police. She said: 'Just as the police officers arrived, Mr Ahmed and Shafilea turned up at school together. 'They came in and the police asked to speak to Shafilea by herself so we went to the interview room within the school. 'She told us she was going back home, that everything was going to be OK and it was her decision. 'But everything about her body language was in direct contrast to what she was saying.' Mrs Code described Shafilea as 'looking terrified' and said she 'couldn’t sit still in her chair'. She added: 'The police officer told her she could speak freely but she said ""No, no, I’m going back"". 'She kept saying it was fine, she was all right and they had sorted it out. 'But I did not believe that things were fine.' As the meeting ended, Mrs Code told the jury she asked Shafilea: 'Are you sure this is it?'

Police had to launch a desperate late-night rescue operation in China after a section of highway collapsed into a giant sinkhole, trapping a car and killing at least one passenger. The cavernous hole appeared along a busy stretch of Xiangjiang Road in Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province, central China, early this morning. The 30m-square pit swallowed a passing car, and at least one person died at the scene before emergency services could haul anyone to safety. Scroll down for video . Cavernous: Police and emergency services have sealed off the section of road in Hunan Province, China, which swallowed a car this morning after collapsing in the early hours . Rescue: A passer-by assesses the giant sinkhole after police had attempted to pull out the car and its passengers early this morning . Mystery: Investigators are still trying to establish the cause of the road collapsing in on itself on Thursday morning . Chinese authorities did not describe the car which fell into the hole, or identify the victims, but said the vehicle was likely a BMW carrying three people, according to CNN. The cave-in site was close to the Xiangjiang River, a major tributary of the Yangtze, China's longest waterway. One rescuer with the local fire brigade described the sinkhole as being so deep, 'we cannot see the bottom of the pit with the naked eye'. Local police closed the road off as crowds gathered, with investigators trying to establish what caused the road to collapse. A sinkhole is a natural depression in the Earth's surface which can be formed gradually or suddenly and occur worldwide. They can vary in size, from 1 to 600 meters both in depth and diameter and form when the . foundation below the surface layer dissolves. This commonly occurs when . the rock below is dissolved by ground water. Limestone, carbonate rock, . and salt beds are particular vulnerable to erosion. Meanwhile, the top layer of Earth usually stays intact. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania are the states most affected by sinkholes. While . they often occur from natural causes, sinkholes can be man-made and . caused by human activity. Groundwater pumping and construction are the . most likely culprits. Last month, residents in Florida, U.S, looked on in horror as a 40ft wide hole opened up in their street. It completely swallowed up the rear of this house in Hudson, Pasco County. The house collapsed into the ground like a toy house with its contents spilling everywhere. The owner of the home was an elderly woman whose husband died a few years ago.

Egypt's Islamist President-elect Mohammed Morsy has said he wants to restore long-severed ties with Tehran to create a strategic 'balance' in the region, in an interview published on Monday with Iran's Fars news agency. Morsy's comments may unsettle Western powers as they seek to isolate Iran over its disputed nuclear programme, which they suspect it is using to build atomic bombs, which Tehran denies. Diplomatic relations between Egypt and Iran were severed more than 30 years ago, but both countries have signalled a shift in policy since former president Hosni Mubarak was toppled last year in a popular uprising. Mohammed Morsi has been announced as the new president of Egypt and Britain's Foreign Office described it 'as the least bad result' We must restore normal relations with Iran based on shared interests, and expand areas of political coordination and economic cooperation because this will create a balance of pressure in the region,' Morsy was quoted as saying in a transcript of the interview. Rivalry between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite giant Iran has been intensified by 'Arab Spring' revolts, which have redrawn the political map of the Middle East and left the powerful Gulf neighbours vying for influence. Fars said it had spoken to Morsy a few hours before the result of the vote was announced on Sunday. Jubilation: As Egypt's capital's Tahrir Square was thronged with cheering supporters Iran hailed Morsy's victory as a 'splendid vision of democracy' Members of the presidential election campaign of Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party celebrate following the announcement of Mohammed Morsi . Asked to comment on reports that, if elected, his first state visit would be to Riyadh, Morsy said: 'I didn't say such a thing and until now my first international visits following my victory in the elections have not been determined.' Iran subsequently hailed Morsy's victory over former general Ahmed Shafik in Egypt's first free presidential election as a 'splendid vision of democracy' that marked the country's final phase of an 'Islamic Awakening.' Changes: Diplomatic relations between Egypt and Iran have shifted since former president Hosni Mubarak was toppled last year in a popular uprising . The West, Gulf states and Israel reacted with caution to the result, welcoming the democratic process that led to Morsy's election, but stressing that Egypt's stability was their main priority. In contrast to comments he made in a televised address after his victory was announced on Sunday, Fars news quoted Morsy as saying Egypt's Camp David peace accord with Israel 'will be reviewed', without elaborating. The peace treaty remains a lynchpin of U.S. Middle East policy and, despite its unpopularity with many Egyptians, was staunchly upheld by Mubarak, who also suppressed the Muslim Brotherhood movement to which Morsy belongs. The Sunni Brotherhood, whose Palestinian offshoot Hamas rules the Gaza Strip, is vehemently critical of Israel, which has watched the rise of Islamists and ongoing political upheaval in neighbouring Egypt with growing concern. Egypt's formal recognition of Israel and Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution led to the breakdown of diplomatic relations in 1980. The two countries - among the biggest and most influential in the Middle East - still have reciprocal interest sections, but not at ambassadorial level. Egypt's foreign minister said last year that Cairo was ready to re-establish diplomatic relations with Iran, which has hailed most Arab Spring uprisings as anti-Western rebellions inspired by its own Islamic Revolution. Yet Iran has steadfastly supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Tehran's closest Arab ally, who is grappling with a revolt against his rule, and at home has continued to reject demands for reform, which spilled onto the street following the disputed re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009.","Mohammed Morsy's comments may unsettle Western powers as they seek to isolate Iran over its disputed nuclear programme .

Criminals from Eastern Europe are passing themselves off as policemen to rob tourists in Britain. Their numbers are likely to soar during the Olympics as police revealed they had intelligence to suggest hordes of pickpockets and conmen from Eastern Europe and as far as away as South America will flock to London to prey on visitors. Eastern European criminal gangs are already targeting tourists in the capital by posing as plain-clothes officers and issuing bogus fines. Crime wave: Police believe hordes of pickpockets will descend on London during the Olympics. (Picture posed by models) A number of suspects have been arrested recently around tourist attractions after forcing victims to march to cashpoints or hand over their bank card and PIN numbers for so-called security checks. Despite their broken English and lack of police uniform, some visitors have been taken in by fake warrant cards and have provided their name, address, bank details or even handed over their wallet on being asked to verify their identity. Dozens of tourists have been stopped by the bogus bobbies around attractions such as Trafalgar Square, Oxford Circus and areas such as Kensington, Chelsea and Camden. One favourite trick is to rifle through the pockets of the unsuspecting victim swiping valuables and cash cards, while claiming to perform a routine drugs search. Another ruse used by the gangs is to seize bank cards and demand to know the accompanying PIN numbers, saying they need the information to confirm the victim’s identity and that they have permission to be in Britain. Yesterday Scotland Yard revealed it had received intelligence suggesting gangs from South America and Eastern Europe were planning to target the Games. Detective Superintendent Nick Downing, who is leading the fight against Olympics-related crime, said: ‘There is intelligence to suggest a number of people from Eastern Europe and South America are coming to London to target the Olympics and the London economy.’ He said officers had already seen a rise in pickpockets and offenders acting as bogus policemen. ‘Tourists are being duped into giving their PIN numbers over. ‘They are preying on people who maybe don’t understand what a plain-clothes police officer looks like or might do. ‘They are preying on the vulnerability of tourists in London.’ Some people have been sucked in by the scam because of language difficulties and they hail from cultures which have a strong respect for people in authority, Mr Downing said. Crackdown: Suspects have been arrested near tourist attractions including Trafalgar Square . ‘It is theft’, he added. ‘No officer will make any demand for money. ‘They would not take you to a cashpoint and ask you to take your money out. ‘They do not need to know your PIN number.’ Police also revealed that dozens of people across the world had been fleeced by online Olympic ticket scams. More than 50 sports fans who spent thousands of pounds on fake tickets have been traced so far, but police believe scores more may have fallen victim to the multi-million pound black market trade ahead of the Games. Mr Downing said 35 unauthorised and fraudulent websites offering tickets and accommodation packages had been suspended. But Scotland Yard has only managed to shut down a small number of websites suspected of selling fake Olympic tickets, as many sites in America and Holland are beyond their reach. In a separate case, a multimillion pound international ticketing company has been summoned to appear before magistrates next month charged with 22 offences linked to the illegal sale of Olympic tickets. Police are also seeking a European Arrest Warrant for a Dutch suspect who fled Merseyside after his fraudulent Olympic ticket website was uncovered. Yesterday a Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘Criminals posing as police officers in order to dupe unsuspecting members of the public into handing over valuables, cash card details or money have been an ongoing problem in Central London and we have, unfortunately, seen a recent increase in this type of crime. ‘Operation Podium has been working with borough colleagues and other central assets to target these criminals and a number of arrests have been made in recent weeks.’ Big event: The Olympic Stadium in Stratford, east London.

The adopted son of Jerry Sandusky has detailed the agonising seven years of sexual abuse he allegedly suffered at the hands of his father in an audio recording released today. Matt Sandusky, now 33, came forward during his father's child sex abuse trial, which ended last week with the disgraced former Penn State football coach convicted of 45 of 48 charges. In a recorded statement to Pennsylvania State Police, he detailed sporadic instances of abuse that he claimed took place between the ages of eight and 15 at the Sandusky home. In the 29-minute recording, which was obtained by NBC News, Matt Sandusky said the ordeal led him to try . suicide, saying: 'I know that I really wanted to die in that point in . time.' Scroll down for video . Victim in the family: Matt Sandusky, who was adopted by the convicted pedophile Jerry Sandusky (right), recently came forward to say he had also been abused . He said that Jerry Sandusky abused . him 'with, like, the showering, with the hugging, with the rubbing, with . the.. just the talking to me, the way he spoke.' He recalled how his adopted father would blow raspberries on his stomach and touch his genitals. Matt Sandusky said that he would sometimes pretend to be asleep and stay in the fetal position to avoid being touched. His attorneys confirmed the recording's authenticity to The Associated Press. 'Although the tape was released without Matt's knowledge or permission, it illustrates that he made the difficult decision to come forward and tell the painful truth to investigators despite extraordinary pressure to support his father,' lawyers Justine Andronici and Andrew Shubin wrote in a statement. Sandusky's defence lawyer Joe . Amendola told NBC News that his client was devastated by the claims of . his son, whom he and his wife Dottie adopted at age 18 after meeting him . when he was a child through The Second Mile, that charity that Sandusky . founded in 1977. Mr Amendola told the network: 'When Jerry heard that initially, he was very upset. That was the most despondent I’d seen him.' Convicted paedophile: Jerry Sandusky is escorted from the courthouse in handcuffs after being found guilty in his sexual abuse trial at the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte . He added: 'He’s not a beaten man. He . is pacing a cell right now being held in solitary confinement... At this . point, he maintains his innocence adamantly.' Prosecutors were eying Matt Sandusky as a possible rebuttal witness if Jerry Sandusky took the stand in his own defence. Both sides rested their cases last week without calling either of the men to testify. Yesterday, it was revealed that Matt . Sandusky told police he had been sexually abused by the convicted . pedophile, but was worried he would be charged with perjury for not . admitting the attacks under oath to a grand jury. Karl Rominger, part of Jerry Sandusky's defense team, told ABC: 'As a general rule it's a tape of Matt (Sandusky) making the allegations. 'I don't feel comfortable going into specifics about what he says, but I'll say that he is an alleged victim, so that will tell you some.' Secrets: Matt Sandusky, pictured as a teenager, revealed he had been molested last week . The young man hesitated to reveal the horrific abuse he was also allegedly a victim of because he had previously said under oath that no abuse had taken place. His lawyers, Andrew Shubin and Justine . Andronici, issued a statement on last Thursday that named Matt Sandusky and . saying that the 33-year-old had been prepared to testify on behalf of . prosecutors at his father's sex abuse trial. The case rocked the Penn State community following the defense coordinator's arrest in November. The ensuing scandal led to the firing of Sandusky's former boss - Hall of Fame coach Joe Paterno - and the university's president, while forcing a re-examination of the role that college administrators played in reporting abuse allegations. A juror who voted to convict the retired Penn State assistant coach said she hoped the verdict would help his accusers heal. Jurors weighed the accounts and evidence diligently before finding Sandusky guilty last week of 45 counts for sexually abusing 10 boys over 15 years, she said. Sandusky, 68, is under observation at . the Centre County jail, where he is being kept away from other inmates . pending a psychological review that will help determine the next step . toward his sentencing in about three months. Judge John Cleland ordered county probation officers to evaluate whether Sandusky is a sexual predator, a finding that could factor into his prison placement. Sex offenders are required to undergo treatment while in prison, so if deemed a predator,  Sandusky would likely be sent to a facility with such a program. Sandusky, who has been placed under a suicide watch, said he doesn't want to kill himself and wants to get the separate psychological examination done so that he can receive visits from his friends and family, Rominger said. Preparing an appeal: Joe Amendola, defense lawyer for Sandusky, talks to the media outside court after Sandusky was found guilty and charged with 45 counts of sexual abuse . 'He's fine but he's just not been evaluated,' the lawyer said. 'He is very disappointed to be in prison. He is anxious to get out of this suicide watch.' Rominger added that Sandusky told him: 'If I have to keep sitting in this room for another three or four days without being able to talk to anybody, I might start to need help at that point.' The state investigation into Sandusky didn't begin until after the ex-coach was barred from a high school in 2009, when a mother complained about the former coach. Charges were filed against him in November 2011. Sandusky has repeatedly maintained his innocence. He will likely die in prison, given mandatory minimum sentencing requirements. The conviction is just the start of possibly years of legal proceedings over the case. Besides appeals, there remains an active investigation into Sandusky by the state attorney general's office, as well as a federal investigation. The university could also face a wave of new lawsuits. An hour after the verdict Friday night, Penn State said in a statement it was inviting victims to 'participate in a program to facilitate the resolution of claims against the university arising out of Mr Sandusky's conduct'. The school said it sought to address victims' concerns privately, expeditiously and fairly. Asked to clarify, school spokesman Dave LaTorre said the university won't discuss details about litigation or how much money might be set aside for potential settlements, and declined to comment further.

Vote: David Cameron, pictured with wife Samantha at the Cornbury music festival at the weekend, could hold a referendum on Britain's future in the EU . - . David Cameron could hold a referendum on Britain’s future in the EU on the same day as the next general election in 2015 under an explosive plan being hatched by senior Conservatives. The Prime Minister yesterday opened the door to giving people their first say on Britain’s membership of Europe since 1975, although he insisted now was not the time for such a vote. Mr Cameron said he agreed with the ‘vast majority of the British people’ who were not happy with the UK’s relationship with the EU. Critics said his ‘definitely, maybe’ stance on a referendum was too vague to convince voters and appeared chiefly designed to appease Conservative MPs, who have been agitating for a referendum. But Mr Cameron said ‘tactical and strategic patience’ was required, insisting an immediate ‘in/out’ vote while Europe was in a state of flux and uncertainty was not what most people wanted. He intends to spell out this autumn a swathe of areas where he wants powers returned from Brussels to Westminster, including home affairs, employment law and social issues. Some senior Tories suggest he could later announce a referendum in which voters would be asked to endorse a looser relationship with the EU to coincide with the next general election. Although the Liberal Democrats would be likely to walk out of the Coalition, they suggest Mr Cameron could run a minority Conservative government for the last few months of the Parliament. Such a dramatic move could energise Conservative support on election day, helping to deliver the party a Commons majority, in the same way as last year’s AV referendum, which was held on the same day as local elections. Alternatively, the Prime Minister could include a pledge to hold a referendum in the next Tory election manifesto. But his admission that it is not yet clear when such a referendum might be held, or precisely what it should decide, drew scorn from Labour and some in his own party. The Prime Minister has received a letter signed by 100 Conservative MPs, who say the Government must legislate before 2015 to convince voters that it is serious about holding a referendum after the election. Downing Street sources insisted his remarks were necessarily open-ended, since it is not clear what sort of EU will emerge from the debt crisis engulfing the Continent. Breaking up is hard to do: The referendum would be the first time to question of Europe has been put to the public since 1975, when voters backed the Britain's continuing membership of the bloc . In a Sunday newspaper article, Mr Cameron acknowledged the need to ensure the UK’s position within an evolving EU has ‘the full-hearted support of the British people’. He said: ‘There is more to come – further moves, probably further treaties – where we can take forward our interests, safeguard the single market and stay out of a federal Europe. ‘As we get closer to the end point we will need to consider how best to get the full-hearted support of the British people, whether it is in a general election or a referendum. For me the two words “Europe” and “referendum” can go together, particularly if we really are proposing a change in how our country is governed, but let us get the people a real choice first.’ The Prime Minister said there were significant areas where EU powers over Britain should be handed back. ‘Put simply, for those of us outside the eurozone, far from being too little Europe, there is too much of it,’ he said. ‘Too much cost, too much bureaucracy, too much meddling in issues that belong to nation states or civil society or, indeed, individuals. ‘Whole swathes of legislation covering social issues, working time and home affairs should, in my view, be scrapped.’ Foreign Secretary William Hague said there would be a ‘very, very powerful’ case for a referendum if Europe moved towards a more federal system, as expected in response to the eurozone crisis. 'Very, very powerful': William Hague said that, if Europe moved to a more federal system, there would be a strong case for holding a referendum . But he said on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that the Government wanted to see whether it could negotiate a better relationship between the UK and Brussels, with the return of powers, before putting the matter to the British people. But Tory MP Mark Pritchard, a longstanding critic of Mr Cameron over Europe, said: ‘Once again, when it comes to Europe, it is always “jam tomorrow”. But tomorrow never comes. The PM should get an Olympic sailing gold for tacking.’ John Baron, another Conservative backbencher, said: ‘This does not go far enough, it falls short of what is required. ‘We have had too many vague commitments and promises in the past. There is a huge credibility gap – the public don’t trust politicians any more – and that is why we need a legally-binding commitment to hold a vote after the next election.’ Lib Dem sources made clear the party would not countenance a referendum while it was in power with the Conservatives – even though it was the only party to suggest an ‘in/out’ vote in its last election manifesto. Business Secretary Vince Cable said talk of an EU referendum was ‘horribly irrelevant’ with the Continent in the grip of economic crisis.","PM opens door to giving people their first say on Europe since 1975 .

He lived most of his life looking over his shoulder after famously becoming a mafia turncoat to help jail his gangster friends. Mobster: Henry Hill died yesterday, just a day after his 69th birthday, after a long battle with an undisclosed condition . But the ‘rat’ immortalised by actor Ray Liotta in the Hollywood mob classic Goodfellas has died at the age of 69 – of natural causes. Henry Hill’s three decades in hiding did play some part in his passing. He died at a hospital in Los Angeles on Tuesday having suffered a heart attack brought on by years of smoking, a habit he blamed on his nerves. But right to the end, he managed to stay one step ahead of the mafia assassins he long feared. In 1990, his life was turned into the Martin Scorsese crime classic in which he was played by Liotta alongside Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci. Hill’s last major job with his gang was the Lufthansa heist at John F Kennedy airport in New York in December 1978, which netted them a then record £3.2million. For the last 30 years he had been in a witness protection programme, having turned against the mafia and informed on them to the FBI to save his own skin. In recent times however he had ventured out in public more – opening a restaurant called Wiseguys, launching his own brand of spaghetti sauce and appearing on US TV talking about gangster movies. Announcing his death, Hill’s girlfriend Lisa Casserta said he ‘struggled with alcoholism’. She said Hill had recently made his peace with his family, but ‘I don’t think he ever got over his demons’. Born on June 11, 1943, in the tough Brownsville area of New York, Hill was the fifth of seven children and the first son to his Sicilian mother Carmella and his father, also called Henry. Henry Hill was played by Ray Liotta alongside de Niro, Paul Sorvino and Pesci . In trouble: A police mugshot of Henry Hill following his arrest in New York . Against his father’s wishes Hill got in with the mafia crowd aged 11 when he started hanging around with the infamous Lucchese family. Lured by power and money, Hill gradually became more entrenched with the family and while his half-Sicilian genes – his father was Irish – meant he could never be a fully-fledged member of the family, he was able to be an associate. His first arrest came when he was 16 years old and he carried out the Lufthansa raid after serving a six-year prison sentence in the Seventies. Background: Henry's father, left, also called Henry and his mother, Carmella, right, who was half Sicilian . Following his arrest for the robbery on April 27, 1980, detectives played him wire taps of other  mob members threatening to kill him but he refused to talk, at least for a while. Eventually, Hill testified against his former associates to avoid a possible execution by his crew or going to prison for his crimes. The high life: Ray Liotta who played Henry Hill in the film about his life and Lorraine Bracco who played Hill's wife Karen . The family: Frank Adonis who played Anthony Stabile, Liotta who played Hill and John Manca who played Nickey Eyes star in Goodfellas in 1990 . Later . life: Henry Hill smiles during and interview at the Essex County jail . in Newark, New Jersey. His autobiography was adapted by Martin Scorsese . in the film Goodfellas . The testimony led to 50 convictions, but it meant that Hill, his wife Karen, and their two children had to be put in the US Marshals’ Witness Protection Programme in 1980. They also had to change their names, and move to undisclosed locations in Omaha, Nebraska; Independence, Kentucky; Redmond, Washington; and Seattle, Washington. Due to his numerous crimes while in witness protection, Hill and his wife, from whom he separated in 1989, were expelled from the programme in the early 1990s. In 2006, at the encouragement of Liotta, Hill entered rehabilitation to combat his drug addiction problems. He was arrested on a number of occasions in recent years for public drunkenness.","Mafia gangster died day after his 69th birthday after battle with long illness .

British soldiers in Afghanistan claim that new tactics are preventing them shooting at the Taliban until they have been fired at themselves – resulting in an alarming rise in the number of casualties. The troops say they have had to change their procedures as part of American-led efforts to cut down on the number of civilians being wounded, but the new approach has made them more vulnerable. In the past three months, 11 British soldiers have been killed by enemy gunfire in Helmand province, compared with just two in the same period last year. In the line of fire: British soldiers say a tactical change stopping them from firing first has left them at greater risk of death or injury while on patrol in Afghanistan . The Ministry of Defence denied there has been any change in the rules of engagement for British troops. However, a spokesman for the multinational forces headed by US General John Allen confirmed there had been a tactical review after which the British were told to alter their procedures. Soldiers now say they are particularly vulnerable when they are manning checkpoints at road junctions or patrolling Taliban heartlands such as the so-called ‘green zone’, a densely vegetated river valley. In the past, they say, they could shoot first at armed insurgents but are now only allowed to return fire. One junior non-commissioned officer said: ‘When I arrived in Helmand, my officers said our tactics were going to change. ‘They said that if I saw somebody carrying a rifle or a rocket launcher, I shouldn’t fire at him. Only if he shot at me or a member of my patrol, and I could see a muzzle flash from his rifle, could I use my weapon. ‘I was shocked and so were my mates. We are trained to close in and kill the enemy, not to let him stroll on, watch us and let him choose the best time to ambush us. ‘It has been hard to obey these orders while on patrol. There have been many occasions when we have come under fire from the Taliban, who we’ve seen following us through the green zone. ‘On previous tours, we would have engaged the enemy first to show them what we were made of. We’re up for a fight but now we always have to back off. ‘It makes me question the point of us being here. ‘Older guys like me have seen the tactics change over the years and 2012 is the hardest because we’re taking so many backward steps. I really feel for the families of the guys who’ve lost their lives, and I miss my mates who are dead.’ Surge in casualties: U.S. Air Force Med Evac personnel carry a stretcher with a wounded British soldier from their helicopter into an ambulance in Camp Bastion . Conservative MP and former British Army officer Patrick Mercer said: ‘The Taliban can move as they please, even when heavily armed, and we’re not interfering with them. ‘Currently there is a reluctance to engage and a preference for a policing approach. ‘Soldiers I’ve spoken to feel frustrated and vulnerable. The rise in fatal wounds from gunshots comes as no surprise. ‘I feel deeply for the soldiers placed in this perilous position.’ Military sources say the timing of Gen Allen’s demands was unfortunate because the orders coincided with a tactical shift by the Taliban. It recently stepped up ambushes because of growing British success in thwarting mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Change of strategy: General John Allen, commander of the International Security Assistance Force . Gen Allen, commander of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), has also forbidden the firing of rockets into mud-brick compounds housing ordinary Afghans but also used by the Taliban. Soldiers say tactics have changed dramatically since British forces arrived in Helmand in 2006. Back then, they could engage anyone who posed a threat – whether or not they were armed. But in 2009, US General Stanley McChrystal, who was then ISAF’s commanding officer, ordered British soldiers only to engage insurgents who were bearing arms. Gen Allen ordered a tactical review after negotiations between ISAF and the Afghan government. The country’s president, Hamid Karzai, has criticised ISAF for causing civilian casualties, with the UN estimating that more than 3,000 were killed last year. An ISAF spokesman said: ‘We have conducted a number of conferences devoted to the reduction of civilian casualties. ‘These conferences have been a forum for passing tactics, techniques and procedures to the operational level and into practice. ‘Gen Allen recently ensured all commanders reviewed and certified their troops on the updated tactical directives, with an emphasis on the prevention of civilian casualties.’ The MoD said: ‘There has been no change to UK rules of engagement, and our forces continue to have the freedom they require to operate in support of increasingly effective Afghan security forces. ‘We have always been very clear, as has ISAF, that our troops go to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties. ‘Recent amendments to the ISAF tactical directive reflect that commitment, but in no way limit the use of fire support in situations of self-defence.’","11 UK soldiers gunned down in Helmand in past three months, compared to two in the same period last year .

When Joseph brays, his eeyore reverberates around the village, across the valley... and if the wind is blowing in the right direction, it can be heard in the neighbouring village two miles away. He does it late at night and early in the morning, often waking residents. Most residents in the village of Brierley in Yorkshire are fond of Joseph the donkey, despite his noisy braying at all hours . Until now, everyone has accepted the loudmouth ass as a quirk of life in the South Yorkshire community of Brierley. But a single complaint to the council from an unknown source has prompted an investigation into ‘whether or not the donkey is causing a noise nuisance’. When residents learned his not-so-quiet life in a field behind the village club could be under threat, they rallied round to launch a campaign to save him. A Facebook group called ‘Save the Brierley Donkey From Being Shot’ – not that he really faces such a grim fate – has more than 1,100 members. Beauty therapist Samantha Thompson, 41, who set up the group, said she was often woken by Joseph at 4am but could not bear it if anything happened to him. Joseph has been threatened with eviction after neighbours of his owners Clare and Phil Williams complained to the council about his eeyore . She said: ‘Joseph has a really distinctive loud eeyore. It sounds like someone is being strangled but it’s part of living around here. He makes everybody laugh with his braying, even if it is in the middle of the night. 'He is very noisy, but he certainly doesn’t deserve to be put down or moved out. How could anyone want to get rid of him? ‘Sometimes the noise is a bit overwhelming at 4 or 5am but it’s no different from living next to a busy road or a railway line. You get used to it.’ Joseph’s owners, Phil and Clare Williams, discovered a complaint had been made to the council’s environmental health department when an officer visited last month. Mr Williams, a father of nine, said: ‘He has got a very loud bray. You can hear it over the hill in Grimethorpe, the next village. Samantha Thompson, left, from Brierley set up a Facebook page called ""save the Brierley donkey"" to try and stop Joseph, right, from being evicted . ‘We don’t know why it is so loud but he is only doing what comes naturally and it can sound different depending on his mood. He brays if he sees someone coming or going to work in the early hours. It’s his way of saying hello. ‘Apparently there has been a donkey in the village for at least 100 years and it is supposed to be lucky.’ Mr Williams has received a warning letter detailing the complaint and the council’s procedure to investigate it. But with the support of most villagers behind Joseph, he believes the complainants will not pursue the matter. Residents have their suspicions about who lodged the complaint, but no one has claimed responsibility. For action to be taken, evidence must be obtained to prove Joseph is causing a nuisance under the 1990 Environmental Protection Act. Councillor Roy Miller, Barnsley Council’s environment chief, said the complainant is asked to fill in a ‘diary sheet’ but the inquiry will be closed if the sheet is not handed in ‘within the next few days’. He said Joseph would not be destroyed even if the case was proven. It is more likely that he would be moved to a remoter field.","Most resident in the village of Brierley, South Yorkshire are used to Joseph's braying at all hours .

A Ferrari-driving millionaire was last night being quizzed by police on suspicion of shooting a solicitor in the face with a sawn-off shotgun. Property developer Michael Chudleigh, 61, was arrested  35 minutes after a gunman walked into the lawyer’s office in the market town of Devizes, Wiltshire. The victim, father-of-three James Ward, 58 – described as a ‘lovely’ family man who would do anything for anybody – was shot at his desk and left fighting for his life. Suspect: Michael Chudleigh at his house in Wiltshire in 2007. The 62-year-old has been named locally as the man arrested by police in connection with the shooting of solicitor James Ward in Devizes yesterday . Last night Mr Ward’s wife Nicola . Morris, who also works at his firm, was keeping a hospital bedside vigil . along with their children. Police are investigating whether Chudleigh bore a grudge against the solicitor. It is understood that the tycoon was . recently evicted when his stunning £2million converted farmhouse in the . tiny village of Rowde, near Devizes, was repossessed. The Tudor-style ‘dream home’, . Kingfisher House, boasts five bedrooms, marble bathrooms, and a 62ft . heated outdoor swimming pool with a thatched bar. Shot: Solicitor James Ward who is fighting for his life after being shot in the head at his office in Wiltshire . He lived there with Francine Whale, . his married business partner, and once explained the arrangement by . saying he she had initially allowed him to keep his ‘very rare Ferrari’ parked there, then he moved in himself. Neighbours claimed Chudleigh had been . evicted in April after falling on hard times.One, who asked not want to . be named, said they had seen armed police swooping on the property. Four staff members were in Mr Ward’s . offices on Monday afternoon, when the shooting took place. Two members . of the public – including an off-duty paramedic – rushed in to try to . help Mr Ward before he was airlifted to hospital. Last night police were granted an extra 12 hours to question Chudleigh. Detective Chief Inspector Ian . Saunders, from Wiltshire Police, said: ‘This clearly is a very tragic . incident. The victim is currently at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol with . life-threatening head injuries. ‘The man who has been arrested was found in the village of Rowde shortly afterwards. ‘He was sitting a short distance away . from his car. We found him to be in possession of a weapon which we . believe was the same shotgun used in the attack on Mr Ward.’ Chudleigh is well-known in the area, . following a 2007  story that revealed how he bought his married lover . Rachel Leigh a £100,000 Ferrari, a Rolex and jewellery, only to discover . she was secretly also cheating on him with one of his friends. On discovering the second affair, he stormed round to her home and confronted both her and her taxi driver husband. Investigation: Forensic officers outside Morris, Goddard and Ward in Devizes, Wiltshire where the man was shot yesterday . The property developer and Francine were tied up by two masked men in October 2009 - when they stormed his home with a shotgun and stole £50,000 worth of jewellery . It is thought Mr Chudleigh was evicted and the property repossessed by the mortgage company in April . Wealthy: Mr Chudleigh, who runs Kingfisher Builders, is listed as living at the sprawling converted farm house with former business partner Francine Whale . Afterwards, Chudleigh said: ‘Rachel . was the love of my life. I left my former partner Carol for her. I left . my house for her. 'I left everything for her – but she has left me in . bits. ‘I even proposed to her in Winchester . Cathedral and gave her an £8,000 sapphire engagement ring, which was a . copy of Princess Diana’s engagement ring. 'We had the most amazing sex . life.’ In an unrelated 2009 incident, . Chudleigh and his business partner Mrs Whale were tied up by two masked . men in a shotgun robbery on their home. The robbers made off with . £50,000 worth of jewellery. Speaking after the ordeal, the . property developer said: ‘We were bound head and foot and they . threatened to kill me if I did not tell them where the money was.’ Mr Ward set up his family law firm, . Morris, Goddard and Ward, around 20 years ago. Two of his children are . believed to be at university with a third working in Madrid. Mr Chudleigh had a nine year affair with married blonde Rachel Leigh, right, and admitted to romping in woods behind her house while her husband David was at work . Crime scene: A police cordon surrounds the solicitor's firm in Devizes, Wiltshire, where James Ward was shot in the head .

Staring straight ahead, many with their right arm casually balanced on the back of a chair, these Victorian adults look lost deep in thought. What their demure expressions fail to reveal, however, is that they are all posing for their police mugshot. Although each is an offender apprehended in Newcastle in the 1870s, in only a couple of photos is it possible to detect any inkling of remorse. Instead, their bewildered faces reflect a time when photography was a relatively new technology and posing for a picture a rarity. Jailed: Labourer William Brankston (left), 43, from Alnwick, Northumberland, served a one-month sentence after he was convicted of stealing four rabbits, while blacksmith William Bell (right), 32, was sent to Newcastle Gaol for stealing beef . Criminal records: John Grieveson (left), 21, was sentenced to four months in Newcastle Gaol for stealing pigeons. Charles Burns (right), 19, a miner from Liverpool, was jailed for three months after being convicted of false pretenses . Punished: Mary Patterson (left), 25, was jailed for six weeks for stealing poultry in 1873, and Mary Ann Ross (right), 34, worked as a prostitute and was convicted of stealing money on numerous occasions. She was sentenced to six months in Newcastle Gaol following this mugshot . The fascinating images, which mostly . feature petty thieves who stole everything from rabbits to champagne, . have been released today . by Tyne and Wear Archives and Museums. The criminality detailed in the . charges may be the same as in contemporary Britain, but the mixture of . scruffy clothing and more formal Victorian street attire worn in the . mugshots clearly defines an era of mass poverty. Shipbuilding and heavy engineering . were Newcastle’s main industries in the 19th century and the city was a . powerhouse of the Industrial Revolution. But while the latter had made . Britain rich, it also led to grinding poverty in cramped inner-city . slums plagued by hunger and disease. Liz Rees, Head of Archives and Collections at Tyne and Wear Archives and Museums, said: ‘Newcastle expanded . enormously from the 1850s onwards and as the population increased, . living conditions for most were poor. 'It was a boom town with people . coming in from the countryside, Ireland and Scotland looking for work, . but there weren’t always enough jobs to go around.' Caught: John Roman (left), was a 64-year-old tailor from Germany who was sentenced to 14 days of hard labour for stealing clothes in 1873. Ezekiel Yates (right), 35, was a grocer from Penrith who received a six-month sentence for stealing tobacco . Thieves: Newcastle street trader Mary Ann McCasfrey (left), 41, was given a four-month sentence for stealing a gold watch, while Irish labourer Edward Shevlin (right), 32, was jailed for six months for stealing a coat . Imprisoned: Catherine Flynn (left), 34, was sentenced to six months at Newcastle Gaol for stealing money from another person, and Jane Carlisle (right), 29, served two months at the same jail after a conviction for stealing bed linen . As today, metal thefts were on the rise, due to the booming shipbuilding business in Newcastle at the time. Ms Rees said: ‘It was mostly opportunism . with metal hanging around, but obviously it had a resale value. There’s . still a lot of metal theft going on around here today.’ The widespread poverty led to parents . educating their children in the skills of street survival, condemning a . further generation to a life of crime. Nigel Green, historian and author of . Tough Times, turned up police records which show that in the years from . 1838 to 1851 the number of minors arrested for petty crimes more than . doubled. Some of the children picked up by the . police were as young as eight, and they were often held in stinking . prison cells alongside adults. These pictures of adult offenders, as . well as those of their juvenile counterparts, make up just some of Tyne . and Wear Archives and Museums’ collection, which are being put online. Thomas Smith (left), 32, was jailed for three months after he and two accomplices defrauded a gentlemen in 1873. James Richley (right), 30, was served seven days of hard labour at Newcastle Gaol for stealing trivets, used as supports for kettles . Robert Hardy (left), 21, served four months at Newcastle Gaol for stealing ale with two accomplices in 1873, while labourer Robert Bolam (right), 20, from Gateshead was found guilty of stealing clothes and sentenced to six months. He also had two accomplices who also received six-month sentences . Cabinet maker David Barron (left), 19, was sentenced to six months in prison for stealing champagne. Alice Mullholland (right), 18, was a street trader from Newcastle who was sentenced to three months in Newcastle Gaol for stealing boots . Agnes Stewart (left), 28, was a married woman from Edinburgh was jailed for stealing money, and William Harrison (right), a 51-year-old porter from Durham, was sentenced to 12 months in Newcastle Gaol in 1872 after he was convicted of obtaining oats by false pretense .","Fascinating police images were taken in Newcastle in the 1870s .

Claims: Sofia Arif claimed her husband, accountant Arif Anwar Zar, ran the family finances with an iron grip and hid his money behind 'sham debts' to friends and a son from his first marriage . The estranged wife of a multi-millionaire claimed today he faked bankruptcy to dodge a divorce payout as she begged a court to protect 'financially weaker spouses' in break ups. Sofia Arif claimed her husband, accountant Arif Anwar Zar, ran the family finances with an iron grip and hid his money behind 'sham debts' to friends and a son from his first marriage. Mr Zar, 56, who denies the accusations, declared himself insolvent with debts totaling £2.3million, four months after his wife - who his 20 years his junior- filed for divorce in June last year. However, his wife’s barrister, James Ewins, claimed all but £400,000 of that is owed either to his adult son from a previous marriage or to two 'friends'. He told the judges: 'The husband has relied in his bankruptcy on at least £1.9million of sham debts allegedly owed by the husband to his own son, Raziz Rehan (from a previous marriage), and two friends. 'It is the wife’s case that most, if not all, of what Raziz Rehan claims to own is in fact held by him for his father, and his father can call on it whenever he wants.' Telling the judges that Mr Zar also claims his half of the former matrimonial home is beneficially owned by his son, Mr Ewins said. 'This is a case of a true pater familias who owns all the family wealth no matter in whose name it is held. 'In the absence of the sham debts, the husband would not have been balance sheet bankrupt because he would have remaining assets of at least £1.6million. Venue: The hearing, at the Royal Courts of Justice, followed an appeal by Mr Arif against a judges order that the challenge to his bankruptcy be heard before a divorce judge, rather than a specialist commercial judge . 'The husband had made a thinly veiled threat that he would make himself bankrupt and that, in doing so, he knew exactly what he was doing. 'The husband and his creditors are, on the wife’s case, perpetrating a fraud against her, an innocent third party in the bankruptcy... none of that is surprising but neither is it fair or just,' the barrister added. The hearing followed an appeal by Mr . Arif against a judge’s order that the challenge to his bankruptcy be . heard before a divorce judge, rather than a specialist commercial judge . in the High Court Chancery Division. Asking for the issue to be decided by a family judge, Mr Ewins said the i'nquisitorial' nature of the divorce courts would subject Mr Zar’s financial dealings to deeper 'scrutiny'. Lord Justice Thorpe allowed the husband’s appeal at the end of a half-day hearing, with reasons to be given at a later date. Mrs Arif’s bid to have her husband’s bankruptcy annulled will now be heard by a Chancery judge, separately from her financial claim in the divorce courts. Both hearings are expected to go ahead later this year.","Sofia Arif begged judges to protect 'financially weaker spouses' in divorce battles .

Actor Mark Rylance yesterday quit his role in the Olympics opening ceremony after the sudden death of his ‘beloved’ stepdaughter. Filmmaker Nataasha van Kampen, 28, collapsed from a suspected brain haemorrhage on a flight from New York. Several doctors who were fellow passengers tried in vain to save her life on American Airlines flight AA106, which landed at Heathrow last Sunday morning. Heart of gold: A photo of Nataasha from her boyfriend's Facebook page - she died of a suspected brain haemorrhage . Rylance – one of Britain’s greatest Shakespearean actors – was due to recite verses from The Tempest during Danny Boyle’s ‘Isles of Wonder’ ceremony on July 27. But the Olivier Award-winning actor pulled out after announcing his ‘beloved daughter’ had died of ‘unsuspected natural causes’. Nataasha is the daughter of Rylance’s wife Claire van Kampen, and has known the actor since she was three. Her sister is award-winning actress Juliet Rylance. In a statement yesterday, Rylance, 52, announced: ‘Our beloved daughter and sister Nataasha passed away of unsuspected natural causes early on Sunday morning. ‘Because of our bereavement, I have decided to withdraw from my commitment to the opening ceremony of the Olympics.’ Mark Rylance married Nataasha's mother Claire van Kampen in 1992 . In an emotional tribute to his ‘Beautiful Taashi’, Nataasha’s boyfriend, London pub landlord Martin Fitzgerald, wrote: ‘Never have I met anyone who filled my life with such joy, a kind soul who brightened up my life even after we just met and a perfect lover who made me feel like the luckiest man in the world. A brain haemorrhage is the rupture of a blood vessel which leads to bleeding in or around the brain. It can happen after a head injury, but also – as appears to have been the case here – with no warning at all. This type of brain haemorrhage is a form of stroke and caused by weak or abnormal blood vessels in the brain. There are 9,000 hospital admissions for this type of haemorrhage a year – of which 80 per cent are people aged between 40 and 65. The mortality rate  is about 40 per cent. Professor Tony Rudd, vice-chairman of the Stroke Association, said: ‘There is usually no warning in these cases, it is often a genetic abnormality the person is not aware of.’ ‘I feel so privileged to have been able to spend time with you, be close to you, kiss you and share my deepest thoughts with you. I know that when I look up to the sky you will be the brightest star, shining light on my soul and bringing me the happiness and warmth I so desperately miss. ‘I love you so much and will do forever and always.’ Nataasha, a gifted independent filmmaker, started work at 16 for Sky Television, and went into production for short films before joining the London Film School. Her debut, Nocturne, was shown at the London Young Filmmakers Festival. Dividing her time between New York and London, she described herself as an artist, designer and film-maker. She lived in a flat near trendy Borough Market, close to London Bridge, but professed her love of New York and listed it as her ‘home town’ on Facebook. One neighbour, who said she had spoken to Mr Fitzgerald, said: ‘She had a cerebral haemorrhage on the plane. It’s just tragic – she had a heart of gold.’ Another neighbour, Karen Tate, 40, said . Nataasha was often seen in the area, walking her Jack Russell terrier, . Apache. She added: ‘I always used to talk to her as I walked my dog. She . was a lovely woman, and very, very pretty.’ Mark Rylance's stepdaughter Nataasha van Kampen died unexpectedly from 'natural causes' Accomplished: Actor Mark Rylance, who was was due to recite verses from The Tempest during Danny Boyle¿s 'Isles of Wonder' opening ceremony, revealed today he is pulling out after his stepdaughter died suddenly .

A frail 84-year-old Alzheimer's sufferer was put in handcuffs because a policeman feared for his own safety. Alan Bailey became confused and frightened when health workers made a decision, without his family present, to put him in hospital. Terrified and alone, he was then strapped into a stretcher and handcuffed. Frail: Alzheimer's sufferer Alan Bailey, from Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, pictured with his nephew's wife Cath Bailey, was put in handcuffs because a policeman feared for his own safety . Police later said the decision was taken to protect Mr Bailey, the police, ambulance staff and the public. But last night the force's chief constable said the presence of an officer was 'inappropriate'. The degrading treatment was yesterday described by his family and experts as 'inhumane' and 'unforgivable' and they say the stress of the incident may even have contributed to his death the following month. At Mr Bailey's inquest on Monday, coroner John Pollard attacked PC Alan Twentyman for his heavy-handed approach, telling him: 'This is totally ridiculous, officer, it beggars belief. Mr Bailey was an elderly, frail and frightened man with little understanding of the world around him and what would happen to him.' The nightmare for the retired design engineer began in March last year at his home in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester. At the time, Mr Bailey's wife, Mary, was in a care home and he lived alone. She has now died. Mr Bailey received regular care from local health workers but they decided his condition had deteriorated to the point where he needed to be sectioned. His daughter, Sandra Coombes, 52, a local trading standards officer, had been due to accompany her father to hospital but the meeting was moved forward by 24 hours and Mrs Coombes was unable to attend. 'Little understanding of the world around him': Mr Bailey, pictured in 2008 with wife Mary and daughter Sandra, had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act when he was handcuffed by police . Upset: Mr Bailey's daughter, Sandra Coombes (pictured), who was absent when her father was sectioned, has criticised the way he was treated . No support: Health workers had been due to meet Mrs Coombes at Mr Bailey's home (above) to discuss his health, but the appointment was moved forward 24 hours and she was unable to attend . Health workers went ahead with their decision to send Mr Bailey to hospital without Mrs Coombes present. Instead, he was left in the hands of medical staff he did not know increasing his fear and agitation.  Once inside the back of the ambulance he was strapped to a stretcher causing him more distress. As Mr Bailey attempted to free himself, the officer on board handcuffed him claiming he feared for his safety, the medical staff on board and members of the public. Mr Bailey was taken to Tameside General, Manchester, on March 3 last year where he stayed for six days before being transferred to the Meadows Hospital in Stockport where he suffered a fall. He eventually died in April last year. 'Intelligent, kind and honest': Mrs Coombes, pictured with her father on her wedding day in 1986, said he was treasured by his family . An inquest was required because he fell at the hospital. At the inquest, Mr Pollard added the decisioon to section Mr Bailey without his daughter, Sandra Coombes, being present was 'ill considered'. He said he would write to the chief constable over the training of officers in dealing with mental health patients, in particular in the use of handcuffs. Speaking after the inquest at Stockport Coroners court where a verdict of accidental death was recorded, Mr Bailey's daugter said the way in which her father was treated was 'deplorable'. Mrs Coombes said:'I believe his death was partly down to the stress of what happened. Not only the excessive use of force, but to send a policeman to accompany him was unbelievable. 'When I went to see him in hospital he was black and blue. I couldn't believe the state of him and he couldn't tell me what had happened. He was approaching 85 and only weighed around seven stone. 'I'm really angry about the whole situation. The manner in which the mental health workers and the police came in showed no consideration for him or me. 'They kept saying it was for his own well-being but they caused him so much distress and anxiety by removing him from his home of 62 years.' Mrs Coombes said: 'There was no need to handcuff him. My dad was so frail. Why on earth did they handcuff him? To send a policeman to accompany him was unbelievable. 'The way my father was treated was inhumane and I will stand by that for the rest of my life. It's been deplorable from the minute the mental health people started dealing with my dad. I will never ever forgive them for what happened.' Detective Chief Inspector Koran Sellars, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Handcuffs were used to prevent Mr Bailey harming himself, the police officer, medical staff in the ambulance and members of the public on the road. 'Anybody would have got into a panic if they were suddenly handcuffed, least of all someone with Alzheimer's.' Joyce Robins, Patient Concern . 'Due to Mr Bailey's demeanour and age, . attempts at physically restraining him may have led to Mr Bailey . sustaining serious injuries, therefore handcuffs were deemed the safest . and most reasonable option in the circumstances.' But yesterday Sir Peter Fahy, Chief Constable of the force, admitted a police officer should never have been present to restrain Mr Bailey describing what happened as 'inappropriate.' Ian Weatherhead, of Dementia UK, said: 'The moving forward of a meeting by health workers which in effect excluded Mr Bailey's daughter would suggest this was a serious contributing factor to the appalling treatment he was subjected to. Family members need to be involved and listened to at all times. 'The tragic story regarding Mr Bailey and his family shows that there is still continuing widespread lack of education and understanding around dementia. 'It also highlights a number of mistakes, not just in the totally inappropriate handcuffing by the police.' Joyce Robins, of Patient Concern, said: 'This is absolutely disgraceful. I can't imagine how this happened. 'People with Alzheimer's need calming down and they need to have people they know around them. I can't understand why they didn't wait for the daughter to get home. Anybody would have got into a panic if they were suddenly handcuffed, least of all someone with Alzheimer's.' Henry Ticehurst, medical director for Pennine Care said: 'Arrangements were in place to assess Mr Bailey with his daughter present but due to a rapid deterioration in his health, the assessment was conducted earlier to prevent further harm. 'The Meadows is a specialist mental health unit providing care and treatment for older people suffering with mental health issues and as such, was an appropriate place for Mr Bailey to receive the care he needed.' Earlier this year police were condemned after they fired tasers at terrified Alzheimer's sufferer, Peter Russell, 58, who struggled when he was being taken to hospital. Six officers were called and to his Lincolnshire home and he was shot with several taser stun rounds, before being manhandled to the floor.","Alan Bailey was tied to stretcher in an ambulance after being sectioned .

A BT worker strangled a married colleague during a lunch break and then killed himself after she refused to start an intimate relationship with him, an inquest heard today. Darren Hunt, 43, killed fellow IT professional Beverley Farrow, 31, as she lay on a bed at his home before hanging himself in his garage. Police broke in and found the pair dead on the night of December 8 last year after Mrs Farrow's husband Daniel returned home with their young son and found her missing. Killed: Beverley Farrow was strangled by Darren Hunt after she refused to have an affair with him, an inquest heard . Det Chief Insp John Brocklebank of Suffolk Police told how Mrs Farrow and Hunt both worked at BT's research headquarters in Martlesham, near Ipswich, Suffolk. He told the hearing in Ipswich that the pair were friends, but he added: 'Darren wanted a more intimate relationship with Beverley. There’s clear evidence that she did not.' Hunt, who was nicknamed Daz, was found hanging with a bottle of whisky lying nearby in his garage at his rented home in Walker Chase on the Grange Farm estate in Kesgrave, near Ipswich. A note which is believed to have been written by Hunt was found next to her body. It said: 'Sorry world, and those who tried to help me. Sorry Ma, it’s not your fault.' Murder suicide: A forensic officer at the scene where Mrs Farrow was killed . The note also said he 'never could get the hang of Thursdays'. He was found dead on a Thursday. Mr Brocklebank said Hunt had purchased 'an item capable of being used for restraint' the day before the pair were found dead. He said the cause of Mrs Farrow's death had been 'compression of the neck' and that there was bruising to her forearms and wrists consistent with being restrained. Det Supt Brocklebank added: 'No evidence has been found Beverley Farrow intended to take her own life. To the contrary, she had everything to live for.' He said despite extensive investigation into emails and mobile telephone records, there was no evidence the pair had 'anything other than a close friendship'. Tragic: Mrs Farrow and Mr Hunt worked together at the BT research centre . On the day the pair died, Mrs Farrow had sent a message to her husband telling him she was having a lunch break with Hunt. The inquest heard how Mr Farrow tried to contact his wife and Hunt on their mobile phones without success after finding she was not at their home in Jennings Drift, Kesgrave. He then went to Hunt's home in a cul de sac around half a mile away, but was unable to get a response and called police at around 8.40pm. Officers used a crow bar to break into the garage after seeing a light on inside and then brown a door to get into the house. Greater Suffolk Coroner Dr Peter Dean said: 'It is difficult to think of circumstances more devastating than this.' Gathering evidence: Police remained at the home for several days sifting for evidence . He recorded a verdict that Mrs Farrow was unlawfully killed and that Hunt took his own life. A statement from Mrs Farrow's family said: 'She was a beautiful, sweet natured person who liked everyone and would harm no-one. 'She was a beautiful, sweet, darling wife, a fantastic, natural mum who loved dancing, rolling around and having fun with her son, with whom she had a truly special bond. 'We cannot express how devastated we are over the loss of Bev, who was so cruelly taken from us. Our lives have been turned upside down and will never be the same.'","Darren Hunt, 43, killed Beverley Farrow, 31, after she refused to have affair .

This is the shocking moment a foreign driver ran over a group of British tourists as they celebrated Spain's Euro 2012 win in Magaluf. The motorist bounced over the bodies of the fallen holidaymakers in his Range Rover before nonchalantly driving off as if he had gone over a speed bump. Joe Worsnop, 20, was seriously injured as he partied on the Spanish holiday resort's main strip with a group of friends. His twin brother James was also hurt. Carnage: The car rolls over several people as one young man, front, tries to step out of the way . Footage of the group partying in the street as they were knocked down by the car was caught on camera and posted on YouTube. A mob further down the street reportedly smashed the vehicle's windscreen as it was driven off after witnessing the incident. Police later arrested a 37-year-old Spanish man and forensic tests are being carried out on the vehicle. The holidaymakers were celebrating Spain's 4-0 win over Italy in the Euro 2012 final in the early hours of Monday morning when the incident happened. The emergency services were called and Joe's twin brother James telephoned their mother, Trish, from the back of the ambulance at home in Bradford, West Yorkshire, to tell her what had happened. James was kept in hospital for two days after suffering a gash to his back that needed 17 stitches. Party: Tourists in the street in Magaluf, the Spanish holiday resort, moments before the Range Rover drove straight through the crowd . But his much more seriously injured . brother was in so much pain he was flown home before being taken to Bradford Royal Infirmary after his wounds became . infected. Speaking from his hospital bed, the Kwik-Fit mechanic, who turns 21 on Sunday, said: 'I didn't see the car at first. 'I thought someone had punched me to the floor but when I turned my head all I saw was the Range Rover plate and it was too late, the other wheels went over me. 'I'm just glad to be home. It was the scariest moment of my life but now I feel I'm the luckiest man alive, I'm so lucky to be here.' The mechanic has since written on Facebook:  'The next time I'm under a Range Rover's wheels I want to be working on them, not wearing them.' His friend Michael McDonald, 20, was also hit by the car but managed to escape with minor injuries. Mr McDonald said: 'We'd been coming down from another bar when there were hundreds of people in the street in front of us all chanting football songs. Crunch: The motorist drives off as if nothing had happened with a group of stricken tourists lying in the road . 'A police car came through and let off tear-gas to clear the crowds. Some people did go and things had calmed down but then I was suddenly on the deck and realised I'd been run over, I'd been hit. We heard the driver was arrested eventually but the police are apparently just treating it as an accident.' Danny Nolan, 21, was struck a glancing blow by the Range Rover but he escaped with cuts and grazes. He said: 'I was just inches from going under the car. A bloke who'd been in front of the car and tried to stop him knocked me out of the way as he fell under. 'We're staying on until Sunday but can't wait to get home. It's not the same without Joe, we want to see how he's getting on.' Glyn Hirst, also 21, said: 'This car just came up and mowed people down. The driver got impatient. I felt sick, I couldn't look at first but then I had to go and find my mates. 'The car ran about five people over then stopped for a few seconds. I saw a guy in front of it put his hands on the bonnet but the driver just kept going and went over him and the other guy was still under his tyres. 'That poor guy's still in intensive care. He was begging his mates ""don't let me die"".' The men had been part of a group of 15 Bradford friends who had flown out to Magaluf for a week. A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed its officials were aware of an incident in Magaluf resulting in three British nationals needing hospital treatment and the consul's help.","Motorist bounced over the bodies before nonchalantly driving off as if nothing had happened .

George Zimmerman was escorted from jail Friday afternoon after posting the new $1million bond set by the circuit judge and was whisked away, most likely to the safe house secured to him by his defence attorney. The former Neighbourhood Watch captain raised more than $20,000 in donations since Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester Jr. set his bond earlier this week. He left the Seminole County jail on Friday wearing a white dress shirt and a jacket. Scroll down for video . Freed: George Zimmerman, centre, leaves Seminole County Jail after posting a million dollar bond . Out: The bond had been set less than 24 hours earlier. His previous bond of $150,000 was revoked for misleading the courts about his finances . Zimmerman's . lawyers were able to post the bond with help from an influx of $20,000 . in donations to their client's defense fund after a desperate plea on . its website, the Orlando Sentinel reported. The $20,000 added . to the balance of $211,000 in the defense fund, which was more than . enough to cover the 10 per cent non-refundable portion charged by . bonding companies. 'He is very happy . to be out. It's been a very sobering experience spending the last month . in jail,' Zimmerman's attorney Don West told reporters on Friday . afternoon. Another attorney for Zimmerman, Mark O'Mara, said that the team had secured a temporary safe house for his client. He . is required to stay in the county and must be electronically monitored, . can't open a bank account, obtain a passport or set foot on the grounds . of the local airport. He has a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. He will be required to pay $9.50 a day to the sheriff’s office for the cost of the monitoring. The terms of Zimmerman’s release include tighter restrictions than before, including a requirement that he remain within Seminole County, though his attorney said they were going to petition the judge to be more flexible on where he can stay due to safety aspects. West told Dave D'Marko of Central Florida News 13 that the defense team had taken steps to protect Zimmerman but that off-duty officers are not being paid to shield him. A . judge set Zimmerman's bond at $1 million on Thursday. His previous . $150,000 bond was revoked after prosecutors presented evidence to that . he had misled the court about his finances. The . statement pleading for funds on Zimmerman's legal defense fund website . had contained some of the most urgent language yet from the legal team. In cuffs: Zimmerman is pictured returning to jail on June 3 after his bond was revoked . Accused: Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch volunteer, is accused of murdering Trayvon Martin . 'We . steadfastly maintain that George Zimmerman acted in self-defense and . that he is not guilty of second degree murder,' the statement read. 'For those that . think Mr. Zimmerman has been treated unfairly by the media, for those . who feel Mr. Zimmerman has been falsely accused as a racist, for those . who feel this case is an affront to their constitutional rights – now is . the time to show your support.' The . statement added Zimmerman had to pay a bail bond company $100,000 . dollars – 10 per cent of the $1 million dollar bail – and be able to show he . had collateral worth $1 million. The bond was . raised to $1 million dollars after it emerged Zimmerman . had allowed his wife Shellie to mislead the court about how much money they . had during an April 20 bond hearing. The couple failed to disclose at least $130,000 in donations, made through a PayPal account. Uproar: The killing of Trayvon Martin, who was unarmed when he was shot dead in February, has sparked a national debate about race, guns and self-defense laws . Reenactment: In a video taken a day after the attack, Zimmerman claimed Martin had pushed him to the ground and went for his gun. Zimmerman said he fired the weapon in self defense . Prosecutors argued . Zimmerman and his wife talked in code during recorded jailhouse . conversations about how to transfer the donations to different bank . accounts. Zimmerman at one point asked how much . money they had. She replied '$155' but prosecutors allege that was code for . $155,000. Shellie Zimmerman faces arraignment at the end of the month on a perjury charge; she was freed on bond. During Zimmerman's second bond hearing, his . attorney, Mark O'Mara, said that his client was confused, fearful and . experienced a moment of weakness when he and his wife misled the court. But the judge didn't buy it and accused . Zimmerman of making plans to flee to avoid prosecution, misleading . O'Mara by not disclosing his money and trying to manipulate the judicial . system. 'The evidence is . clear that the Defendant and his wife acted in concert, but primarily at . the Defendant’s direction, to conceal their cash holdings,' Judge Kenneth Lester wrote in his statement on Thursday. Second chance: On Thursday, Judge Kenneth Lester gave Zimmerman a second opportunity to be released while he await trial by setting the bond. The judge had revoked his bond last month . Zimmerman is charged with . second-degree murder in Martin's death. He shot the unarmed youth dead on February . 26 in a gated community but has claimed he acted in self-defense when . Martin knocked him over and began smashing his head against the ground. Zimmerman's release comes after Martin's mother said she was disappointed by the judge's . decision to give Zimmerman another chance at posting bond and . leaving prison before trial. Martin's . mother, Sybrina Fulton, spoke at a news conference on Friday with the Rev. Al Sharpton. She said that knowing her son's killer 'may walk free . sometime, one day, it really hurts'.

Casey Anthony, dubbed the most hated woman in America, stayed in a New York City hideaway immediately after she was acquitted of killing her 2-year-old daughter last July, according to her former defence attorney. In his new tell-all book Presumed Guilty, lawyer Jose Baez details the extent he went to keep the Florida woman out of the spotlight following her sensational July 17 release. The night she was freed, Baez had five cars meet her at a multilevel garage with four acting as decoys speeding off in different directions. One year on: Casey was sensationally acquitted . by a jury last July 5, left, and walked free from jail just over a week . later, right. She then took a trip to New York City, according to her former lawyer Jose Baez, left . To keep her whereabouts unknown, one of Baez investigators drove Casey to New York rather than putting her on a commercial flight. ‘While the entire national media was searching for her in Arizona and California, she was within walking distance of all their offices,’ he says in the book. It is unclear what Casey did or where she stayed during her trip to New York last summer. Casey was sensationally acquitted of murdering her daughter Caylee after a highly-publicised trial last July. Anthony is now living in an . undisclosed location in Florida serving probation for an unrelated . conviction, which Baez said ends on August 21. In his book, Presumed Guilty, Casey Anthony: The Inside Story, Baez also divulges aspects of the Anthony family’s private lives that were not examined during the trial. The lawyer accuses George Anthony of abusing his daughter, and speculates that George could have murdered 2-year-old Caylee to hide evidence of abuse. Accused: Casey Anthony's lawyer accused her father George, left, of sexually assaulting her, and speculates that he killed Casey's daughter Caylee to cover up the abuse . Troubled past: Casey Anthony, centre, pictured July 7th, 2011, says she was frequently molested by her father and told her lawyer that she feared he was Caylee's father . The lawyer accused George of killing the toddler to hide evidence of abuse. Baez first made the shocking allegation at the trial’s opening statements, saying that George killed Caylee, disposed of the girl’s remains, and then lied about it to authorities. Casey confided in Baez that she was worried her father might have fathered Caylee, because he had sex with her around the time she had become pregnant. DNA tests later revealed that George was not the father. George, through a family attorney, denied ever abusing Casey. However, Casey and her father have reportedly been estranged since October 14, 2008, the day, CF 13 News notes, that he testified against her, leading to the grand jury indicting her for murder.He testified in the trial: ‘I would have done anything I could to save my granddaughter.’ Casey Anthony's defense attorney: Jose Baez gestures as he speaks about his just-published book Presumed Guilty, Casey Anthony: The Inside Story almost a year to the day she was acquitted . Someone in the Anthony house . conducted several suicide-related searches on the family computer, . including ‘fool-proof suffocation’ and ‘venturing into the pro-suicide . pit’ on the day little Caylee Anthony vanished, Casey Anthony’s defence . attorney Jose Baez said. The . attorney revealed that the searches were conducted around an hour after . Casey’s father George Anthony said she left the home. While . last year’s trial famously revealed that the family computer also had . searches for ‘chloroform,’ the suicide searches were not revealed, Baez . said, because they were discovered after the fact. He told Good Morning America: ‘I have . a hard time believing that law enforcement wouldn’t check the internet . history of the day that the child went missing. That would have been . bombshell evidence in the trial if it had come out.’ Jose Baez, Casey Anthony's defense lawyer, has written a tell-all book about the case . Prosecutors claimed Anthony . suffocated Caylee with duct tape so she could spend time with her . boyfriend and be free for Orlando's nightlife. Baez said during the trial - repeated . again in his book - that Caylee accidentally drowned in a family . swimming pool and that her father, George Anthony, hid the body. Baez . also claimed George Anthony sexually abused his daughter. George Anthony denied both . allegations, and there was little brought up about them during the . trial. Baez said the defence wasn't required to put on any such evidence . because proving the case is the prosecution's burden, not the other way . around. George Anthony tried to commit . suicide in January 2009, and was found in a Daytona Beach hotel after . overdosing on prescription drugs. A five-page suicide note was also . discovered at the hotel. Baez told GMA that it was hard to . determine who in the Anthony family conducted what searches on January . 16, 2008, but said it was possible to infer who searched what, based on . the terms searched. For instance, one of the terms . searched was ‘foolproof suffocation.’ Baez noted that the terms were . spelled incorrectly, and that George struggled with good spelling. He wrote in his book: ‘By looking at . the websites being researched, all concerned with suicide and death, it . certainly appears that the one who felt the blame was a guilt-ridden . George Anthony.’ In his book, Baez also lashes out at . several entities - calling the media a 'monster', the police 'careless' and the prosecution 'scheming and ruthless'. He wrote: 'This was not real life, it was the media's Casey Anthony . reality show, a show that depended on name-calling and controversy for . television ratings.' Evidence and testimony showed that Casey was a habitual liar, even making up fake friends and pretending . every day to go to a job she didn't have at Universal Studios. Baez was asked whether . Anthony's lies surrounding her daughter's disappearance might be . indicative that she was guilty. Counsel: Defence attorney Jose Baez talks to . Casey Anthony during her trial when the jury heard her father say . her car smelled of human decomposition. Baez revealed in his book he also thought he could smell a dead body . Innocent: Mystery surrounds the cause of Caylee Anthony's death after her mother was acquitted of her murder one year ago today . 'I don't think the lies are . indicative of innocence or guilt,' he said. 'The lies were there long . before Caylee passed away.' In the book, he says Anthony had built a . 'fantasy world,' and her lies weren't evidence of guilt but signs of . someone with 'serious mental health issues.' Baez said one piece of prosecution . evidence he was most concerned about was that police cadaver dogs had . indicated a body may have been in the trunk of Anthony's car at one . point and also that a body may have been in the backyard. None was . discovered in the backyard and there was nothing but rotting bags of . trash in the trunk. But, he said, people - and jurors - believe in dogs. 'That concerned me a little bit. Most people really think dogs can do magic,' Baez said. He also strongly considered early in the case whether she should plead guilty to . a lesser charge to avoid the death penalty if convicted of murdering . her two-year-old daughter Caylee, but Anthony adamantly insisted she had . nothing to do with the toddler's death. New Look: The last time the public saw Casey was when this video was released in October. She is said to be living in Palm Beach, Florida . 'Found': West Palm Beach, Florida, where Casey Anthony is reported to be staying with a friend . Baez said . prosecutors offered in 2008 to allow Anthony to plead guilty to . aggravated manslaughter of a child and serve up to 13 years in prison. He said that in those early days he thought taking it might be in . Anthony's best interest. 'There were times, difficult times, . when the evidence didn't look good for Casey,' Baez said, adding that it . was his obligation as a lawyer to convey any such plea offers. The prosecution's flaw, he added, was . that regarding the car search the dog and handler were focused only on . Anthony's vehicle and did not include others in a lineup to give the dog . options. Overall, Baez attributed the strong . public backlash against the jury's verdict to a lack of understanding . about the judicial system and because 'a lot of people bought into the . hype' that Anthony must have been guilty. He noted that jurors who gave . media interviews after the trial said they waited for weeks for strong . evidence that never came. 'We need to talk about whether an actual murder occurred,' he said. 'That's where the focus should have been, and it never was.' Baez declined to comment on what . Anthony is doing these days and on how often he talks to her. He said he . promised her confidentiality when she agreed that he could write his . book, in which she did not participate. Parents: George and Cindy Anthony both lied to cover up what really happened to Caylee, claims Baez . 'She's doing a lot better than she was in prison,' Baez said, but then added: 'She's a prisoner of her own freedom.' Anthony, he said, 'would not . entertain it for a second'. As he became more familiar with the state's . mostly circumstantial case, Baez said he grew convinced she would be . acquitted by a jury – as she was a year ago today of all charges except . for four misdemeanors of lying to investigators. 'There was nothing in the trial that . ever made me think Casey was guilty of anything as related to the . murder,' Baez said. 'Every single piece of evidence favored us.' He told CBS' Crimesider: 'I think Casey Anthony's story, the whole case, was a media phenomenon. And I say that because she was young, pretty and white. 'If it didn't have those elements to it I don't think it would have taken off.' Prosecutors claimed Anthony . suffocated Caylee with duct tape so she could spend time with her . boyfriend and be free for Orlando's nightlife.","In a new tell-all, former defence attorney Jose Baez reveals that Casey came to New York last July .

Two yobs who stole a memorial plaque honouring two children killed by an IRA bomb blast have escaped prosecution after apologising to one of the victims’ parents. The thugs agreed to a face-to-face meeting with Colin and Wendy Parry after they were arrested over the disappearance of the bronze plaque last month.

Heartless: The plaque was erected in memory of 12-year-old Tim Parry (left) and three-year-old Johnathan Ball . The two men, aged 57 and 29, were both facing court and possible jail terms, but the case was dropped after they agreed to attend a specially-convened panel at Warrington town hall to apologise and say they would carry out unpaid work in the community. It emerged the 29-year-old from Newton Le Willows pulled the plaque off its wall fixings after a boozing binge with friends in the town centre. The 57-year-old, from Warrington, then found the plaque lying on the floor and took it home. The plaque was recovered following a raid at the older man's home. Cheshire Police said the 57-year-old man had agreed to carry out four days of voluntary work in the community. The 29-year-old offered to raise money for the Tim Parry Jonathan Ball Foundation For Peace through a sponsored event. The move is part of the Government’s new restorative justice campaign and means the pair will not face court. Valued opportunity: Wendy and Colin Parry said they appreciated the apology from the thieves . Grieving: Mr and Mrs Parry lay a miniature Christmas tree on their son's grave . In a statement, Mr and Mrs Parry said: 'We valued the opportunity to meet the two people who removed the plaque.

The plaque, which was erected alongside a water feature, was unveiled by the Duchess of Kent on November 14, 1996. The offenders were arrested in June after CCTV images helped identify them.

'They then have the opportunity to listen to the full impact of their crime on their victim or victims and apologise for their actions. 'It puts the needs of the victim first as it allows them to be directly involved in the punishment of the offenders. 'This is not an easy option as many offenders find it difficult to take responsibility and face up to the impact of their crimes.' Two other men were also arrested over the theft of the plaque but were later freed without charge.

An outraged cyclist has received a cheque for just 23p from court  after a thief who stole his £160 bike was ordered to pay him compensation. Cyclist Jean-Louis Bourdon was delighted when told police had caught the thief who stole the bike. But his delight turned to disgust when he received the compensation cheque. Jean-Louis Bourdon was outraged when the 23p cheque from the courts service arrived almost a year after his bike was stolen. The design engineer said he had already felt let down when he learned he was to get only £25 paid back by the thief. He was told the £25 payout was part of £500 compensation magistrates in Derby ordered the crook to pay to 21 victims who had their bikes taken by him. Almost a year later, a letter arrived from the courts service - but he was astonished to find it contained just the cheque for 23p. He said: “It is both infuriating and ridiculous and they even spelled my name wrongly on the cheque they sent me. 'I would rather have not received anything at all. 'To me it just goes to show that crime does pay and the legal system doesn’t know what it is doing. I was mad enough about the £25 offer but they said they couldn’t do anything to help me. But to get this cheque for 100th of what I was going to be getting is completely mystifying.' Mr Bourdon was outraged when he received just 23p in compensation for his stolen bike. The 33-year-old returned home to his flat in Derby, in July, last year, to find the bike missing. He called the police to report the crime and then later was told the thief had been caught and convicted of taking 21 bikes from around Derby. Mr Bourdon received a letter from HM Courts and Tribunal Service telling him about the £25 he would receive and he wrote a letter of complaint to its tribunal service who wrote back to him. In their letter it said: 'In your case the defendant was ordered to pay £499.94 to 21 victims of crime. 'The defendant is currently in receipt of benefit and is paying that back at £10 a fortnight. 'The large number of victims and the restriction on repayment periods has greatly reduced the amount of compensation each victim will receive.' The cheque for just 23p in compensation that was sent to Jean-Louis Bourdon nearly a year after his bike was stolen. Jean-Louis said he felt “insulted” by the letter. He said: 'I don’t even know what I am going to do with the cheque now. 'It certainly isn’t worth queuing at the bank to pay it in for.' He said the court's weak punishment would simply encourage more thefts. A spokesman for Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunal Service said it vigorously pursued offenders who fail to pay victims’ compensation, and that the 23p cheque had been sent to Mr Bourdon by mistake. 'Money can be taken from an offender’s earnings or from benefits if they are unemployed. 'Warrants can be issued instructing court employed agents to seize and sell goods belonging to the offender. 'It is an independent judicial decision as to the size of monthly repayments of compensation to victims and fines - this is based on the ability of the defendant to pay.' 'If the defendant owes compensation to more than one victim the court will allocate the payments among those witnesses,' said the spokesman. 'It is normal practice for smaller cheques not to be sent to victims until the repayment has reached £5. 'In this case the 23p cheque was issued in error for which we apologise.' 'The spokesman could not say when Jean-Louis would get his first cheque for £5 or when he might be expected to finally receive the total amount of compensation awarded.'","HM Courts Service sent cyclist misspelled 23p cheque for £160 bike .

The youngest member of Captain Scott's polar team described the 'absolute hell' he endured during the doomed  expedition in a series of previously unseen letters to his mother. Apsley Cherry-Garrard, who joined the expedition to reach the South Pole at just 24, wrote of his fear when the men did not return after setting out to reach the South Pole a century ago. In a letter dated six months later, Cherry-Garrard described his horror at finding the frozen bodies of Captain Scott, Edward Wilson and Henry Bowers in the snow after a 12-man search party was sent out to look for them. He also described symptoms of a physical and mental breakdown and the team's fear of being discounted as failures when they returned home because Norwegian rival, Roald Amundsen had reached the pole a month before them. Perished: The members of the ill-fated expedition to the South Pole, (l to r) Lawrence Oates, Henry Bowers, Robert Falcon Scott, Edward Wilson and Edgar Evans . 'Dear Mum': Youngest member of Captain Scott's polar team Apsley Cherry-Garrard wrote 27 letters to his mother during the doomed Terra Nova expedition. They are now set to fetch £80,000 at auction in October ott polar expedition. Detail: One of Cherry-Garrard's letters dated Sunday February 4, 1912, almost a year before Scott and his team perished on their attempt to reach the South Pole . Now the 27 letters, which emerged from a family member to mark the centenary of the expedition this year, are set to make £80,000 when they are auctioned at Christie's in London, on 9 October. Thomas Venning, books and manuscripts . specialist at Christie's, told The Guardian: 'This is one of the last really . important missing pieces of the story of the expedition.' Captain Scott's Terra Nova team set out for the South Pole in June 1910. Cherry-Garrard's letters run from the start of the mission to the tragic return of the survivors in February 1913. Cherry-Garrard had remained at base camp that fateful day when Scott, Wilson, Bowers, Lawrence Oates and Edgar Evans set off for the pole. They reached it on 17 January but to their horror discovered the Norwegian team led by Amundsen had preceded them by 33 days. Evans and Oates were first to die on the return journey - Oates famously left the tent in an Antarctic blizzard saying: 'I am going outside and may be some time'.

Scott, Wilson and Bowers died around 29 March after trekking hundreds of miles and enduring harsh arctic gales. All three men died from starvation and tragically were found just 11 miles from base camp on 12 November. Cherry-Garrard wrote: 'We have found the bodies of Scott, . Wilson & Bowers, and all their records... Their death was, I am quite . sure, not a painful one – for men get callous after a period of great . hardship – but the long fight before must have been most terrible.' He added: 'Theirs is a fine story... Wilson & Bowers had died very quietly, probably in their sleep.'

The then 26-year-old told his mother he had endured 'about the worst time I have ever had... it has been an absolute hell'. He also worried about 'hostile criticism' on his return home. In actual fact Captain Scott and the Terra Nova team were hailed as British heroes. Despite criticism of the expedition more than 50 years later, Scott's attempt is thought of today as a feat of endurance in an age of heroic polar exploration. Christie's specialist, Mr  Venning, said: 'With hindsight, it feels as if it was always a given that the death of . Scott and his companions would be hailed as a paradigm of British . heroism, but the letters show us the real fear amongst the expedition . members that they would be received as failures.' Captain Scott also wrote many letters before his death on the ice scape. Impact: Captain Robert Scott was also a keen letter writer and penned his last to wife Kathleen asking her to encourage their son Peter to take an interest in the natural world .

The brother of Soham murderer Ian Huntley has spoken for the first time about his evil sibling and how he hates the child killer. Wayne Huntley said: 'I don't want him around...I wish he was dead.' He has laid bare the sickening truth about his brother who murdered 10-year-old Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in Soham, Cambridgeshire in August, 2002. In his book, The Blood We Share, Wayne tells how: . The book details how the family gathered for a showdown with Huntley 12 days after Holly and Jessica vanished on August 4, 2002 while going to buy sweets. Huntley, the Soham school caretaker, had made a late-night call to his mother Lynda from a hotel on the outskirts of Cambridgeshire where police had put him after questioning him about the girls' disappearance. She asked Huntley: 'Did you do it?' Her heart sank when he replied: ' I love you mum.' It was was at that moment that she knew her son was guilty, according to Wayne who had been present during the call. Wayne and his father Kevin picked up Huntley from the hotel and brought him back to the family home in Littleport eight miles away. Lynda burst into tears when she saw her son who looked haggard after hours of police questioning. Schoolgirl victims: Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in Manchester United shirts . She embraced Huntley, but, Wayne revealed, his brother stood in front of her with his arms down and would not hug her. Lynda recalled in a subsequent interview with police that her son said to her: 'You do know I love you don't you?' I said, 'I love you, too, son.' The family spent the next few hours trying to coax a confession from Huntley but he refused to say anything except: 'They're gonna arrest me.' Five hours after Huntley called his mother, police in four cars arrived at the family's bungalow, but mistakenly grabbed Wayne and twisted his arm behind his back. Finally, Huntley was arrested and handcuffed while sitting in a chair in the front room. The family then had to leave the house as officers sealed it off as a crime scene. Charred: The remains of the Manchester United top worn by Jessica Chapman on the day she disappeared . Burnt: The Manchester United top worn by Holly Wells on the day she disappeared. It was found in a rubbish bin . Crime scene: Ian Huntley's home where Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman were murdered . In the book - being serialised in the Sun - Wayne told of the cushy prison life enjoyed by Huntley who has been imprisoned since 2003. He has cookery classes with other inmates and is allowed to buy ingredients and then cook a meal which they all share - including pizzas and on one occasion steak. The killer watches his favourite team,Manchester United, on television seemingly unmoved by the shocking connection with his victims. Huntley once boasted to his brother during a visit that notorious prison hard man Charles Bronson was in the next room. But Wayne is convinced his brother is still haunted by his crimes and will commit suicide rather than spend the rest of his life behind bars. Guilty: Ian Huntley's girlfriend Maxine Carr gave him a false alibi . Huntley has twice tried to kill himself with an overdose and had his throat slashed by another inmate in his cell in march, 2010. Wayne told the Sun: 'I know he will try to kill himself again, but I don't think he should be able to do it. he deserves to feel the pain and fear he inflicted on those girls. 'Every day he deserves to think about what he has done'. At his trial Huntley claimed he accidentally killed the girls at his house. His  girlfriend Maxine Carr was jailed for 21 months for giving him a false alibi. Wayne, from Reading Berkshire, claimed Huntley faked mental problems when he was arrested - but his brother easily beat him at chess and table tennis during jail visits before his trial. He believed Huntley's behaviour was just a charade to fool the court. ' 'I'm just thankful his trickery never paid off, ' he said.","His mother knew monster was guilty before police arrested him .

Each gold bar weighed between 50g and 100g and in total weighed in at 2.5kg. The bars have no markings so it is difficult to trace where it come from.

A teenager who stole from his 80-year old disabled grandmother has been spared jail after she wrote a letter to the judge pleading for his freedom. Sean Ellis, 19, was facing custody for stealing two gold chains from his grandmother Enice Williams. He was let off with a community order after Mrs Williams wrote a moving letter saying a prison term would ‘destroy’ both their lives. Despite the fact that this was the second time Mr Ellis was caught pinching items from the pensioner's home in Wythenshawe, she wrote a letter to the sentencing judge at Manchester Crown Court asking him to spare him. An extract from the note, read out in court, said: ‘The idea that Sean may go to jail has caused me so much upset and distress that it has affected my health. ‘If Sean was sent to prison, I would be absolutely devastated and this would destroy me and a young lad's life. ‘I only wanted him to get a telling off. It was a second's lapse of judgement and I believe he's sincerely remorseful.’ The judge heard how Mr Ellis had already been banned from Mrs Williams' home, on Baycroft Grove, Northern Moor, for stealing his sister's mobile phone. On February 14, this year, he returned to the address and stole his gran's jewellery. The defendant's mum, Anita Hall, who is Mrs Williams's carer, arrived at the house and caught her son inside. Mrs Williams realised three days later that her two gold chains were missing. Ellis had already sold one of the chains . at Cash Generators, but handed back the other. The second item was later . bought back and also returned. The judge at Manchester Magistrates Court took the elderly woman's letter into consideration and ruled that Mr Ellis be spared jail . Judge Anthony Gee QC told Ellis: ‘You're before the court for the mean offence of theft of jewellery belonging to your 80-year-old grandmother who thinks the world of you. ‘Those who commit offences like this would expect to lose their liberty for a substantial period.’ Leaving court: Mr Ellis will not go to jail thanks to his grandmother's letter . But he added: ‘Nearly any offence of burglary committed in such mean circumstances would expect immediate custodial sentences but there are various reasons here, not least the plea from Mrs Williams.’ The court heard that the defendant admitted his guilt and was remorseful, and also had a medical condition. Ellis, also of Wythenshawe, was given a 12-month community order with supervision and must carry out 60 hours of unpaid work. He earlier pleaded guilty to burglary when he appeared at Manchester magistrates' court. After the hearing Mrs Hall said: ‘My mum wrote the letter because Sean's a really good lad. ‘He's a young lad in debt like a lot of young lads. Just for a second, in a lapse, he got desperate. ‘He took the things back. It's just unfortunate it happened really.’ Judge Gee warned Ellis: ‘Your grandmother hoped that you would only get “a telling off”. Well regard yourself as being told off. ‘But it's more than that. If you breach this order you will be coming back in front of me.’","Sean Ellis, 19, was facing jail for stealing two gold chains .

Police are to re-open an investigation into the Birmingham pub bombings that killed 21 people nearly 40 years ago, it has been revealed. Detectives will open a cold-case probe into who carried out the suspected IRA attacks in November  1974, which also injured 182 people. In 1991 six men, known as the Birmingham Six, were released from prison after spending 17 years behind bars when their convictions for the bombings were quashed by the Court of Appeal. Blast: The Mulberry Bush pub in Birmingham was completely destroyed in the blast which killed 21 people . Since their release families of the victims have launched dozens of appeals to have the case re-opened. Yesterday, the head of counter terrorism at West Midlands Police said he wants forensic experts to review potential new evidence. Detective . Chief Superintendent Kenny Bell, head of Counter Terrorism at West . Midlands Police, has made the commitment in a letter to the sister of . one of the atrocity. He wrote to Julie Hambleton, 49, . whose sister Maxine was killed in the bombings aged just 18, saying: . 'Forensic science continues to develop. I will ensure that we consult . with a forensic expert to establish how science has advanced and if new . techniques can evidentially assist us with bringing those responsible to . justice.' Review: Detective Chief Superintendent Kenny Bell is tasking officers to review all the old files in the case while right, Julie Hambleton holds a picture of her sister Maxine who was killed in the attack aged just 18 . Not guilty: The Birmingham Six made up of Paddy Joe Hill, Hugh . Callaghan, Richard . McIlkenny, Gerry Hunter, Billy Power and Johnny Walker celebrate outside . the Old Bailey after their release from prison after 17 years . The city's head of counter terrorism is also tasking officers to bring together and look again at all the old files in the case. He . wrote: 'It is important we gather, understand, consolidate and preserve . all relevant material in one central repository. While the scale of . this is a huge undertaking, it will greatly assist with our ability to . assess the relevance of any new evidence. 'It will also give me confidence in providing you with information that is accurate.' Det Chf Supt Bell promised to give the victims' families regular updates on the process of gathering the evidence. West Midlands Police had never officially reopened the case after the Birmingham Six had their convictions quashed. Ruin: The inside of the Mulberry Bush pub after the blast. The IRA have long been suspected of the attack . Paddy Joe Hill, Hugh Callaghan, . Richard McIlkenny, Gerry Hunter, Billy Power and Johnny Walker spent 17 . behind bars before being released. Detectives . last month revealed they are to launch a murder investigation into the Bloody Sunday deaths of . 13 civilians shot dead by British soldiers in Londonderry more than 40 . years ago. The probe will last at least four . years and raises the possibility that former British soldiers – some now . in their 70s and 80s – could stand trial facing criminal charges. Thirty officers will focus on the . actions of UK paratroopers following the findings of the £195million . inquiry by Lord Saville which said none of those killed were armed and . no warning was given before soldiers opened fire. All six men, all Irish, all Catholic, had been drinking in a . pub at New Street station in Birmingham on November 21, 1974 before boarding a train to catch . a ferry to Belfast. Within six minutes, bombs exploded in two pubs on . the station precincts, destroying the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern. Twenty one people were killed and many of the victims were aged between 17 and 25. Warnings were sent but police did not evacuate people in time. The men, all carrying mass cards, were travelling . to the funeral of a friend, an IRA man who had blown himself up whilst . assembling a bomb. They were all Republican sympathisers. In court they claimed . they had confessed only after being beaten by police but the court did . not believe them and so began their long battle for . justice. The Provisional Irish Republican Army . (IRA) has always been widely blamed for the attacks although it has . always denied responsibility. Terrorism: Rescuers pick through the rubble after the explosion which also injured 182 people in 1974 . Det Chief Supt . Bell said of his team's new efforts: 'This task will take some . considerable time, however, I undertake that you will receive updates on . a bimonthly basis.' The written assurances back up what . Mrs Hambleton claims she was told in a meeting with the top officer at the . force's Lloyd House HQ. She . has spearheaded the Justice for the 21 campaign calling for the pub . bombing murders to be reinvestigated - and is now optimistic a . breakthrough could finally be made. She said: 'We've had so many false . dawns before that we are quite cautious, but we're hopeful new evidence . can be uncovered that could lead police to the killers. Memory: Flowers at the memorial stone remembering the 21 victims outside St Phillips Cathedral, Birmingham . 'He said it would take months to centralise the files, bundle them into segments and then be scanned by a small team to enable him to fully answer the questions we have asked him. 'What we want to know is how much physical evidence there was from the bombing itself like clothing for example or debris which might contain DNA evidence. 'If the Stephen Lawrence murder trial came about because of a blood splatter on a jumper, then there must be some evidence from the bombings which can help trace the killers. 'I am encouraged that Mr Bell will get the evidence in one place but there is still a hell of a long way to go before those who are responsible will be brought to justice. 'It is appalling that in a civilised country the mass murder of 21 innocent people has not been investigated and those who committed the atrocity have been allowed to go free. 'Maxine was just 18 when she was killed. She had been accepted to study Law at Leicester University but she never lived to see the letter of acceptance, she would have been 56 this month.' Earlier this year, Birmingham Six member Paddy Hill divulged a list of names to police whom he claimed were responsible for the bombings. Meanwhile, the Justice for the 21 campaign has been backed by MPs and MEPs across the country including Chancellor George Osborne. A petition calling for the bombings to be re-investigated has been signed by more than 2,200 people.","IRA are suspected of the attacks in 1974 which also injured 182 people .

Snake school: The event held by the The Shortgrass Rattlesnake Association aims to educate the public about rattlesnakes from the dangers they pose to the their beneficial role in the environment . Joel took the image as part of a photographic assignment for National Geographic Magazine. He said: 'I went there as part of a story on animal migrations in North America, though we don't often think of snakes as migrating, they do indeed. There are dozens of species of rattlesnakes across the US, and they are the largest among venomous snakes. They usually only sound their noisy rattles if they feel cornered, threatened or taken by surprise. Rattlesnake bites are usually not fatal, as long as they are treated quickly, but deaths have occurred. If bitten, victims are advised to remain calm, as a quickened heart rate can spread the venom throughout the body faster. Rattlesnakes . love to sun themselves, and can be found near logs, boulders, or open . areas, and in areas like mountains, prairies, deserts, and beaches. 'In winter they gather in large numbers in dens. That's where the hunters will often find them. 'A wrangler's job is not without risk, yet these guys are good at it. 'It is possible for wranglers to be killed by snakes, I think the danger aspect is the attraction and the reason so many folks come from far and wide to the event. 'But the wranglers are careful and . very few have been bitten over the years.' He told how he visited one who had been . bitten in the lower leg while working in the snake pit. 'He'd . been wearing tennis shoes instead of cowboy boots and one had bitten . him just above the ankle,' he said. 'His leg had turned black and he was in the . hospital. He eventually made a full recovery.' He said despite the hard work of the wranglers in the town, the number of snake sightings keep on rising. And as the largest of the venomous snakes, they are not hard to spot. 'The . wranglers are doing what they need to do in order to keep their town . running, and they say that the numbers of snakes at the dens isn't . decreasing,' Joel added. 'Environmentalists, on the other hand, . will say that rattlesnakes take a long time to reach sexual maturity . and so snake hunting really knocks their numbers down . 'My . job is not to share my feelings on the subjects I cover, but instead . tell stories and let the readers think about it a little and make their . own minds up.' Rattlesnake bites are usually not fatal, as long as they are treated quickly, but deaths have occurred.

Whatever the reason, when Henry the racing pigeon set off from France to Yorkshire he ended up 4,500 miles away in the Bahamas. He had been given up as lost by his owner Fred Lock, but turned up in good health four weeks later on sun-kissed Eleuthera Island. Well hello there: Henry takes a stroll on Eleuthera Island after he took a wrong turn on his trip from France to England . Mr Lock, 59, was astonished to receive a call from a British woman working on the island with the news that Henry was safe, well and enjoying the holiday of a lifetime. Just how the 16-month-old bird reached the Caribbean will never be known, but no one believes he flew all the way across the Atlantic. Mr Lock, of Leeds, said: ‘He must have hitchhiked on a ship to make it over there – and get away from our weather! ‘I’ve heard of people finding their pigeons in Belgium, Holland and Germany, but never this far away. It’s unbelievable.’ The great adventure began on May 25. Eight of Mr Lock’s pigeons had been taken to Lille in France for the 286-mile race home. Only seven returned. ‘When he didn’t arrive back from France with the rest after about six hours I thought that was that,’ said Mr Lock, a catering firm driver. Harry's journey . Being looked after: Henry the wayward winged pigeon is being held by Jason Kincaid in his new holiday home in the Bahamas . Pigeon detective: Harry's owner Fred Lock with one of his flock, which is missing a certain Henry who has decided to holiday to the Bahamas . Then, in the third week of June, Henry flew into a boathouse on Eleuthera Island and presented himself to Kate Barley, 30, who is studying for a PhD in fisheries conservation there. She said: ‘He looked in fine shape. I knew he was owned by someone as he had the ring on. At first we thought it must be someone locally that keeps pigeons and that he would feed up for a few days then move on. ‘He started running up to people and around people’s feet looking for food, and straight away flew on to people’s hands and shoulders for food.’ By coincidence Miss Barley’s father is also a pigeon enthusiast and lives in Grimsby, 60 miles from Mr Lock. Her father told her how to find the owner’s phone number embedded into a wing. ‘That’s when we discovered he was from Leeds,’ she said. Henry is enjoying his new home and has been taken under the wing of Miss Barley and her fiance Jason Kincaid, 31, a diving instructor. Bliss: Henry's new home in the Bahamas... ... is a bit different to his Leeds home! She said: ‘He seems really happy, and waits for Jason to open up in the morning. He starts weaving in and out of his legs and running after Jason until he gets out his food. ‘Then he flies to Jason’s shoulder, and will sit there on his hand to feed.‘He often disappears for half the day, probably exploring, and comes back to relax under the boathouse dock in the shade, and sits and watches everyone loading boats. He gets lots of shouts of “Hello Henry!” now from the kids.’ The pigeon has become a bit of a celebrity. ‘In the Bahamas many of the locals have never seen a pigeon like him who is tame, so showing them how he flies to you for food and how to stroke him is exciting for them.’ Henry may be forced to return home when Miss Barley flies back to the UK in September, but she added: ‘It might be nice for him to live out his days in the sunshine on a permanent holiday.’","Henry had been shipped out to Lille in France in May for a 286-mile race back to his home in Leeds .

A statue honouring Penn State football head coach Joe Paterno has been torn down as the university bows to massive public outcry. Penn State ordered the removal of the statue of Hall of Fame coach early on Sunday morning. Workers lifted the statue off its base and used a forklift to move it into Beaver Stadium early Sunday as the 100 to 150 students watching chanted, 'We are Penn State.' Scroll down for video . Gone: The site outside Beaver Stadium where Joe Paterno's statue once stood has been stripped of all monuments after workers uprooted the statue honouring the late coach . Farewell: Workers are seen carting away the covered statue of ex-Penn State football coach Joe Paterno on Sunday morning . Coming down: Police and construction workers have surrounded the Joe Paterno statue in State College, Pennsylvania as Penn State prepares to remove it . The university announced that it was . going to take down the monument in the wake of an investigative report . that found the late coach and three other top Penn State administrators . concealed sex abuse claims against retired assistant coach Jerry . Sandusky. Paterno, who coached the team for nearly . 50 years before he was fired in disgrace last year at the height of the case . The statue turned into a target for Paterno’s critics after former FBI Director Louis Freeh alleged a cover-up by Paterno and others that allowed Sandusky to continue molesting boys. Police and construction workers barricaded both sides of the street and the sidewalks near the statue. Before and after: Workers gutted the location of the Paterno statue outside Beaver Stadium on Sunday morning . Removal: The Paterno statue was surrounded by a fence and a tarp before it was taken down by construction workers on Sunday . A chain-link fence was also erected around the area and a tarp was raised that concealed most of the statue. In a statement released later on Sunday morning, the Paterno family said: 'Tearing down the statue of Joe Paterno does not serve the victims of Jerry Sandusky's horrible crimes or help heal the Penn State Community. We believe the only way to help the victims is to uncover the full truth.' Statue: The bronze sculpture bearing Paterno's likeness has been sitting in front of Beaver Stadium since 2001 . The family also chided the media for what they called one-sided reporting on a document that Paterno is unable to defend himself against. The Freeh report, though it has been . accepted by the media as the definitive conclusion on the Sandusky . scandal, is the equivalent of an indictment - a charging document . written by a prosecutor - and an incomplete and unofficial one at that. 'To those who truly want to know the truth about Sandusky, it should matter that Joe Paterno has never had a hearing; that his legal counsel has never been able to interview key witnesses, all of whom are represented by lawyers and therefore unavailable; that there has never been an opportunity to review critical evidence which has not been made public; that selective evidence and the opinion of Mr Freeh is treated as the equivalent of a fair trial.' The statement went on: 'Despite this obviously flawed and one-sided presentation, the University believes it must acquiesce and accept that Joe Paterno has been given a fair and complete hearing. We think the better course would have been for the University to take a strong stand in support of due process so that the complete truth can be uncovered.' Construction vehicles and police arrived shortly after dawn Sunday, barricading the street and sidewalks near the statue, erecting a chain-link fence then concealing the statue with a blue tarp. Penn State President Rod Erickson . said he decided to have the statue removed and put into storage because . it 'has become a source of division and an obstacle to healing.' 'I . believe that, were it to remain, the statue will be a recurring wound . to the multitude of individuals across the nation and beyond who have . been the victims of child abuse,' Erickson said in a statement released . at 7am on Sunday. Reaction: Some students and State College residents could not contain their emotions as they saw Beaver Stadium without the statue . Down and out: Penn State President Rod Erickson said he decided to have the statue removed and put into storage because it 'has become a source of division and an obstacle to healing' He said Paterno's name will remain on the campus library because it 'symbolizes the substantial and lasting contributions to the academic life and educational excellence that the Paterno family has made to Penn State University.' Last week, a plane was spotted over State College towing a banner that read 'TAKE THE STATUE DOWN OR WE WILL.' Also last week, the group that runs the . parking area . dubbed 'Paternoville,' where students camp out for tickets before games, . stripped that title and changed the name to 'Nittanyville.' Demands: The banner referred to a monument to Paterno, who coached the team for nearly 50 years before he was fired in disgrace last year . The Penn State student group that . manages the newly-renamed fan area said that their decision would help 'return the focus to the overall team and the thousands of students who . support it.' But that may soon be a moot point, as the NCAA has said it isn't ruling out the possibility of shutting down . the entire Penn State football programme in light of the Sandusky case. The NCAA will announce a punishment against Penn State and its football programme tomorrow morning. A source told CBS News that the penalties against the university will be 'unprecedented.' Getting rid of all traces: Since a scathing report which detailed how much former football coach Joe Paterno (pictured) knew about the child sex scandal, his name is being pulled from much of the school . The bronze sculpture outside Beaver Stadium has been a rallying point for students and alumni outraged over Paterno's firing four days after Sandusky's November 5 arrest - and grief-stricken over the Hall of Fame coach's Jan. 22 death at age 85. But it turned into a target for critics after the Freeh report's stunning allegation of a cover-up by Paterno, ousted President Graham Spanier and two Penn State officials, Athletic Director Tim Curley and Vice President Gary Schultz. Their failure to report Sandusky to child-welfare authorities in 2001 allowed him to continue molesting boys, the report found. The statue has been sitting in front of the stadium since 2001.

Musician Matthew Johnson, 32, was thrown off balance when the bird flew out from a near-side hedge and hit the side of his helmet. An inquest heard it is likely Mr Johnson was hit by his Kawasaki bike, which he bought in 2010, as it 'cartwheeled' down the road before plunging into nearby trees. He was riding under the 60mph speed limit and had not been drinking. He had left his work at Stafford College and was travelling towards Hilderstone at the time of the accident on December 29 last year. The college tutor died at the scene on the B5066 Sandon Road near Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, from multiple injuries. The impact of the collision was such that Mr Johnson's helmet visor was found embedded in the dead bird further along the road. Passing cyclist David Stonier told Cannock Coroner's Court an 'explosion of feathers' shielded his view of the accident after he saw the pheasant shoot out of a hedgerow into Mr Johnson's head. Mr Stonier found him lying in a ditch and two passers-by tried to resuscitate him. Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner Andrew Haigh said: 'This really is an unfortunate combination of events coming together. 'This is a tragic accident.' Members of Mr Johnson's family told the inquest they believed he had hit a manhole to lose control of his bike. Sister Vicky Johnson-Phillips, 36, said: 'Bikers do seem to have a bad reputation but this goes to show he was doing everything right and none of this was his fault. 'He was the most genuine person I have ever known.' Mr Johnson's friend of 12 years, Nathan James, 35, said: 'I have lost my best friend. He was an amazing guy. 'The inquest has shown that he didn’t simply lose control of his bike.' Matthew Johnson, of Waverton Road, Bentilee, was a talented musician well-known in the area's arts scene. He also taught percussion to year 11 students at Brownhills Academy, Stoke-on-Trent. He won the BBC talent show Get Your Act Together in 1999 as part of teenage band Marlo when he was 19 years old.","Matthew Johnson, 32, thrown off balance when pheasant flew out from hedgerow .

A boss at banking firm Goldman Sachs has apologised to his neighbours after work on his £7million town house caused cracks to appear in their homes. One woman had to be rescued from her flat after the work caused so much subsidence that she could not open her door. Other neighbours have complained of cracks in their walls and stairways following the basement excavation at Christoph Stanger's home in Kensington, London. Causing cracks: The excavation at Christoph Stanger's home which has damaged adjoining properties . Building site: The digging has led to subsidence, causing cracks to appear in neighbours' homes . Mr Stanger, a managing director who heads Goldman Sachs' German and Austrian financing group, has offered to compensate his neighbours for the damage to their properties. The 46-year-old, who bought his four-storey Victorian home 18 months ago, is spending £1million to dig out the basement. But emergency building teams had to be called in last Sunday when a pillar holding up the property's portico started to crack under the pressure. Inconvenienced: Neighbours (left to right) Jacqueline Stirling, Marie Stirling, Louise Destale, Jonathan Wearing and Ann Harper stand outside the house, which is covered in scaffolding . Ten tons of roofing has been removed and the front of the building is covered in scaffolding, steel joists and planks. Mr Stanger was granted planning permission for an underground extension in May last year despite objections from nine of the 11 locals consulted by Kensington and Chelsea Council. Louise Stael von Holstein, who has lived in a flat next door for 30 years, told the Evening Standard: 'They’ve been digging since the beginning of the year, down into the basement, and it’s caused the house to subside. 'The basement flat in my block has got cracks everywhere.' Another neighbour said they had been forced to call out the contractors six times in three weeks to open their front door. Mr Stanger, who intends to move into the house with his family in January, said the work was necessary to build a playroom for his children and a guest room. He said: 'I feel bad about the disruption and if there is any real damage it will be dealt with and they will be compensated.' A spokesman for the council said it was aware that basement extensions caused concern for residents.","Christoph Stanger, 46, says sorry after £1m excavation work at Kensington home causes subsidence .

Tragedy: Nastasha Noland, 25, fell out of the door while fighting with another woman and was run over by the bus . A drunken female reveller who fell out of a party bus during a catfight was caught under the wheels of the bus and killed. The two young women clashed on their way back from a country music concert to Santa Cruz, California, when the doors accidentally opened and the tragic accident took place. Natasha Noland, 25, died after plunging from the bus at around 11.50pm on Friday on Highway 17, while a 20-year-old woman from Felton was injured. Several of the 12 to 15 passengers on the Party Bus of Santa Cruz fled the scene, according to Mercury News, and two others were arrested for drunkenness. The group was returning from a Brad Paisley concert at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View and were all 'highly intoxicated' and uncooperative, according to police. 'We're hoping once they sober up they'll cooperate a bit more,' said California Highway Patrol officer DJ Sarabia. The shocking news comes at a time when lawmakers are debating whether to more closely regulate drinking on party buses. Party buses are typically vans that look . like airport shuttles and can seat from 15 to 30 people. They . often have couches and bars instead of row seating and some include . stripper poles and dance floors. 'As they're fighting, somehow the door to this bus opens up and they both fall out,' said Mr Sarabia. 'The victim is run over by the bus, and the other woman is injured.' Ms Noland is the daughter of Todd and Sue, owners of a well-known Santa Cruz surf shop. Employees at Pacific Wave, where she worked as the women's goods buyer, later said they were devastated by the news. Ms Noland was a 'super fun person' who was . friendly and generous, said assistant manager Jessica Eshom, 25. She . loved country music and was known for being fashionable, Ms Eshom said. 'She had a good heart, a good soul,' said Ms Eshom. 'She was an all-around amazing person. It's unbelievable what happened.' Her 20-year-old rival was taken to hospital and treated for moderate injuries, police said. Officers shut down Highway 17 between Lark Avenue and state Highway 9 to conduct an investigation and reopened it to traffic at 3.30am. Night out: The party bus was taking revellers back to Santa Cruz from a concert in Mountain View . Highway horror: The spot near Los Gatos where the devastating accident took place . The driver of the bus, an unnamed woman has not been charged and that the incident remains under investigation. A person who answered a phone call to Party Bus on Saturday declined to comment. Another friend of Ms Noland, Natalia Lockwood, 22, said: 'She was always happy and doing fun things and hanging out with friends.' Vivacious: Ms Noland was a buyer at her parents' popular surf shop and was described a 'fun-loving' The bill seeking to clamp down on party buses would require party bus drivers to check the IDs of passengers. If any passengers are under the legal drinking age, alcoholic beverages would be prohibited unless a designated chaperone aged 25 or older is on board. The bill is expected to go before the state Senate in August. Had it been law already, 'it could have prevented what happened last night,' said assemblyman Jerry Hill, noting that the woman who was fighting Ms Noland was only 20. He sponsored the bill after 19-year-old Burlingame resident Brett Studebaker was killed in another party bus-related accident in 2010. Mr Studebaker died in a car crash on Highway 101 in San Mateo after he got behind the wheel following three hours drinking on a party bus. At the time of his accident, his blood alcohol level was 0.26, more than three times the legal limit. A passenger in his car suffered brain damage and broken bones. Doug Studebaker, the teenager's father, said he was saddened by the news of Ms Noland's death and that it points to the need for regulation of the party bus industry. 'A lot of parents and people don't know the extent of the drinking that occurs and is actually encouraged on these party buses,' said Mr Studebaker. 'There are certain vendors that are very unethical and allow underage drinking - in fact make a business of it.' Mr Hill added that part of the inspiration for his bill was a call he received from a San Carlos mother after her 15-year-old daughter emerged so drunk from a ride to San Francisco aboard a party bus that she had to be taken to the hospital. Government concern: A bill is being drawn up to clamp down on drinking on party buses. Pictured, the Party Bus of Santa Cruz . On the road: Such buses can hold up to 30 people and have couches, bars and TVs in place of normal seating . Minors drinking on party buses 'happens a lot more than we know of,' Mr Hill said. Witness Roberta . Dallimonti said on Sunday: 'I ran to the middle of the road. It was . pitch black and no other cars were around. It was just so crazy. It was awful.' The Dallimontis said they witnessed Noland's distraught boyfriend getting forced to sit in a police car. They said he was angry and punched out a police car window. No one has been charged, and the accident remains under investigation by the California Highway Patrol.","Passengers were being taken home from country music concert .

The family of a model who died after falling from the balcony of her estranged husband’s apartment yesterday accused police of bungling the investigation into her death. Sahar Daftary’s relatives said they had been denied justice as officers had failed to discover the truth about how she died. Rashid Jamil, the husband of Miss Daftary, 23, has  claimed she committed suicide when she fell 150ft from the apartment they shared in Manchester. Miss Daftary’s family refused to accept his explanation, and nearly four years after she died, a coroner yesterday recorded an open verdict on her death. Lovers: Rashid Jamil and Sahar Daftary. He told police that catwalk model Miss Daftary jumped from his balcony after he refused to leave his wife . After the hearing, Miss Daftary’s . mother, Anisa, said: ‘All we wanted is justice, a right that has been . denied us by the police and their failure to investigate what happened. There are still many questions that need to be answered.’ The coroner’s verdict will allow Miss . Daftary’s family to consider taking action against Mr Jamil, 37, who was . arrested on suspicion of her death but never charged, and Greater . Manchester Police. Richard Slade, the family’s solicitor, . claimed: ‘Minimum mandatory steps required in every homicide . investigation were not taken.’ Det Insp Joe Clarke told the inquest . police had not carried out a forensic examination of Mr Jamil’s flat . after Miss Daftary’s death in December 2008. Anger: Sahar's mother Anisa Daftary said she had been 'denied justice' after a coroner recorded an open verdict at the inquest into her death . However, he said the couple were the . only ones who had ‘legitimate access’ to the flat and therefore a . forensic examination was not required. The inquest, at Bolton Coroner’s Court, heard earlier this week that Mr Jamil and Miss Daftary had 'married' in an Islamic ceremony a year earlier but the wedding has no legal status in the UK. The Manchester businessman and father-of-two was already married to another woman when his relationship began with Miss Daftary, a finance and accounting student at Thames Valley University. Mr Jamil was initially questioned by police and later released without charge following an investigation into Miss Daftary’s death. Mr Jamil told the inquest he was in . the lounge of the apartment, on his mobile phone and looking the other . way when he heard a short scream and realised Miss Daftary had fallen to . the ground. Following a week-long hearing, Alison Hewitt, the assistant deputy coroner for Manchester, returned an open verdict today. She . said there was insufficient evidence to prove to the required legal . standard - beyond reasonable doubt - that Miss Daftary was unlawfully . killed or had killed herself. The coroner also said there was not enough evidence to satisfy her that the student may have accidentally fallen. As . Miss Daftary’s relatives sobbed in the public gallery, the coroner . said: 'I am left in the situation where, in my judgment, I am not able . to reach any of those conclusions on the basis of the standard of prove . required. 'And the law states that if that is . the state of the evidence, then the correct conclusion is one of an open . verdict and I am going to record an open verdict.' In . a statement released following the verdict, Miss Daftary’s mother, . Anisa, said: 'Nothing will ever bring back our beloved Sahar. 'She was the heart of our family and her death has left a hole that will never be filled. 'Since . her death all we have wanted was justice, a right that has been denied . us by police and their failure to properly investigate what happened to . her. Beautiful: The inquest heard that Mr Jamil . told police he had been having an affair with Miss Daftary for a couple . of years after meeting her in London while on a business trip . 'We have never believed Sahar took . her own life and hope that everyone can now see that her strength and . personal beliefs show this to be the truth and that there are still many . questions that need to be answered about what happened to her.' Outside the Coroner’s Court, Mr . Jamil’s barrister, Eric Shannon, said: 'The conclusion of this inquest . comes as a very welcome relief to Mr Jamil. 'This tragic death occurred three and a half years ago and attracted a great deal of media interest and speculation. 'A very thorough police investigation . cleared him, and the coroner, in a careful and extensive hearing, has . made no finding of wrongdoing against him. 'This tragic loss has clearly deeply affected everybody touched by it. 'Mr Jamil now simply wants to return to his wife and family and continue normal life.' Miss Daftary’s family described Greater Manchester Police’s investigation into her death as 'a shocking disgrace'. The NV Buildings at Salford Keys, Manchester: Mr Jamil's downstairs neighbour described hearing a heated argument that night before hearing two screams and seeing what looked like a shadow pass her window . Their solicitor, Richard Slade, said: 'Minimum mandatory steps, required in every homicide investigation, were not taken. 'The human consequences in the form of a delay in bringing these events to a just conclusion and the anguish suffered by Sahar’s close and loving family can only be imagined.' He said the family will 'reflect' on what further action they may take. GMP Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney insisted tonight that their investigation followed every line of inquiry. He said: 'First and foremost, our thoughts and condolences remain with the family following their devastating loss. Bride: Daftary, a former winner of the . Face of Asia contest had gone ahead with an Islamic wedding even after . discovering Mr Jamil, 36, already had a secret wife and two children . Sahar with husband Rashid Jamil at their wedding in 2007 . 'It has been an extremely painful time for them. 'Following Sahar’s tragic death in December 2008, a thorough investigation was carried out by police in Salford. 'A file was prepared for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) who reviewed the case and decided that no charges should be brought against a man who assisted us with these complex and sensitive inquiries. 'As recently as this month, Greater Manchester Police carried out an internal review of the investigation which also concluded that every possible line of inquiry was thoroughly looked into by detectives. 'We have responded to every request made by the family’s solicitors and looked into all allegations of possible third-party involvement and found no evidence whatsoever to substantiate any of these claims. 'There was no issue regarding DNA evidence or fingerprints as we had established who had been present in the flat and this would not have been relevant in taking the investigation forward. 'Since Sahar’s death, all our inquiries have been carried out under the full rigour of scrutiny of the CPS and the overview of HM Coroner and I am completely satisfied that no more could have been done to investigate Sahar’s death.'

Richard O’Brien to the ground as co-defendant Marcus Davies . rifled through the OAP’s pockets . An obese woman deliberately sat on a frail pensioner before she and an accomplice robbed him of more than £450, a judge has heard. Margaret Mosley used her weight to pin Richard O’Brien to the ground as younger co-defendant Marcus Davies rifled through the OAP’s pockets. Mosley was 'highly intoxicated' when she sat on on elderly Mr O’Brien’s lap and fell off but the incident was to be the start of a darker turn for the OAP, the court heard. Her friend Davies, 29, pushed Mr O’Brien from his chair and punched the frail man while heartless Mosley pinned him to the floor, in October last year. Davies then went through his pockets, stealing £450 in cash and aiming one last kick at his victim before fleeing the Yates bar, in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. Mosley was still at the scene when police arrived but pretended to be a witness, initially fooling officers as the victim was himself so drunk he said his attackers were two black men. Detectives were only able to piece together the details of the remarkable brawl by watching footage recorded on the pub’s CCTV cameras . Mosley, who was charged with one count of robbery, was handed a 10 month sentence, suspended for a year-and-a-half and an 18 month supervision order by Mr Recorder Raj Persaud at Reading Crown Court. Mr Recorder Persaud said: 'I don’t regard you as being the prime mover in this offence, I can see from the CCTV the part that drink played in the commission of this offence. 'This was highly opportunistic and your involvement came after Mr Davies had pushed Mr O’Brien to the ground. 'I note that the use of force was minimal and you played a secondary role. 'It’s a serious matter that crosses the custody threshold.' The trio were all drinking heavily together at Yates when plump, grey-haired Mosley sat heavily on Mr O’Brien’s lap and fell to the floor, on October 5, 2011. However, the farcical scene turned ugly when she ganged up on the older man with Davies, pinning him to the floor as her cruel accomplice launched the violent attack. However, while Davies fled she stayed at the pub surrounded by other drinkers and when police arrived claimed to be an eye witness to the robbery. Victim Mr O’Brien’s account was so garbled officers initially took a statement from Mosley, of Chesham, Buckinghamshire, only discovering the true part she played in the crime after reviewing CCTV. Davies, of High Wycombe, was previously jailed for 20 months for robbery and common assault at Aylesbury Crown Court.","Margaret Mosley was 'highly intoxicated' when she sat on Richard O'Brien .

A British drugs company has become further embroiled in a scandal involving the damaging effects of the drug Thalidomide, which resulted in thousands of deformed babies around the world. It was today claimed that a German company linked to British pharmaceutical firm Diageo covered up the potential birth-deforming effects of Thalidomide while continuing to distribute the drug 50 years ago. Diageo purchased a company called Distillers in 1997, which had distributed Thalidomide in Australia on behalf of the German firm Grunenthal. A German company linked to British pharmaceutical firm Diageo covered up the potential birth-deforming effects of Thalidomide while continuing to distribute the drug 50 years ago, it was claimed today. Last week, Diageo agreed to pay a multi-million pound settlement to Melbourne woman Lynette Rowe (pictured) And it is Grunenthal which has now been accused of shocking cover-ups over the effects of the morning sickness drug. Diageo agreed last week to make a multi-million pound settlement to Melbourne woman Lynette Rowe, who was born without arms and legs 50 years ago after her mother took Thalidomide. But what was not revealed until today were allegations that the German company knew that Thalidomide was unsafe, but continued to distribute it. According to court files obtained by the Sydney Morning Herald, German medical professionals had told Grunenthal of their concerns that their patients’ or own children’s deformities were caused by women taking Thalidomide during pregnancy. Pregnant women were prescribed Thalidomide in the 1950s and 1960s as a treatment for morning sickness or insomnia. It was withdrawn from sale in 1961 after babies were born with limb deformities and other damage. The drug's UK manufacturer, Distillers Biochemicals, paid around £28million compensation in the 1970s following a legal battle by the families of those affected. In January 2010, the Government finally apologised, expressing its 'sincere regret and deep sympathy' to the victims of the thalidomide scandal. Then Health Minister Mike O'Brien made the formal apology in a statement to MPs. Mr O'Brien also confirmed a £20million support package, announced the previous month, which would be administered through the Thalidomide Trust to help meet the needs of survivors. The papers show that between 1959 and 1961 - while the drug was still being marketed as safe - even employees of Grunenthal and their families began having deformed babies. One company file shows that eight employee families ‘had had deformed children’ between 1959 and 1961. The files show that rather than act on the internal warnings, the German firm told concerned doctors there was no information to suggest the drug was not safe. A German pharmacist, Friedrich Koch, is shown in the files to have written to the company in late 1960 after speaking to a mother who had taken Thalidomide during her pregnancy and whose child was born with internal injuries. The firm wrote back to Mr Koch insisting that there was no problem with the drug. Yet even before Mr Koch had contacted Grunenthal another doctor had been in touch with the firm expressing concerns after his son was born with deformities. Several files are said to reveal that Grunenthal was receiving an increasing number of queries about the drug’s potential harmful affects on unborn babies, while it was continuing to tell the public it was safe. Miss Rowe as a young girl in 1969. A damages settlement was last reached with pharmaceutical firm Diageo, but exact details of the pay-out remain confidential . Eventually, in mid-1961, a Grunenthal doctor is said to have told a fellow employee that in regard to the drug ‘significantly more severe injuries than those already known were to be anticipated' in his opinion. Another doctor working with the German company is said to have told a meeting of executives that the firm needed to carry out tests on animals ‘to determine the possibility of damage to the foetus.’ Such was the concern of staff in the German company, it is claimed, that by May 1961 Grunenthal knew that its own medically trained staff had ‘a very real fear of [thalidomide] side effects’ and were refusing to use the drug within their own families. BDiageo is understood to be now considering settlements with as many as 130 thalidomide victims in Australia and New Zealand – but Grunenthal has continued to deny culpability and is defending lawsuits.","German company linked to UK firm Diageo accused of covering up birth-deforming effects of Thalidomide .

Rainer Reinscheid, a professor of pharmacology at the University of California, Irvine allegedly wrote a chilling email in April titled, 'a good plan,' detailing violent revenge on the people he blamed for his teenage son's suicide. His son hanged himself after being disciplined at high school in March, sending the professor into a downward spiral that authorities said led to setting fires and venting his anger in graphic emails describing plans for a mass murder, sexual assaults and ultimately his own death. Reinscheid fantasized about buying a dozen machine guns, killing 200 University High School students, raping a school counsellor and killing the assistant principal who disciplined his 14-year-old son, Claas Stubbe, he wrote in several emails obtained by the Associated Press. Scroll down for video . Fallen: Rainer Klaus Reinscheid, pictured left on his faculty bio page and right, in his booking photo, is a pharmacology professor at UC Irvine, and was charged with several counts of arson . Loss: Claas Stubbe, pictured on a class trip to the Grand Canyon, hanged himself in March after getting in trouble at his high school . 'I will make him cry and beg, but I . will not give him a chance, just like he did to Claas,' Reinscheid . wrote. 'I will make him die, slowly, surely. Next I will set fire to Uni . High and try to burn down as much as I can, there should be nothing . left that gives them a reason to continue their miserable school.' Reinscheid never acted on his most . violent musings and police have no evidence he was preparing for a . shooting, but prosecutors charged him with a series of small arsons that . targeted the high school, the assistant principal's home and the park . where Claas hanged himself. Five fires erupted between July 1 and . July 19, and police caught Reinscheid as he tried to start a sixth one . July 24, Irvine police Lt. Julia Engen said. While investigating the fires, police . discovered three emails Reinscheid sent to his wife and himself in . April from his university account. Copies of the messages were filed in . court by prosecutors to have him held without bail. He's due in court . for arraignment August 8. In the emails, the distraught father . asks his wife to forgive him for many disappointments but asks her to . understand that he 'had to go this way' after detailing plans to kill . the vice principal and destroy the school in a firestorm. 'You would have done the same if it was your child that you failed,' he wrote to her April 26. Claas was Reinscheid's son from a . previous marriage. He has a stepdaughter and son from his second . marriage. He asked his wife to tell their son, 'Daddy was so sad when . Claas passed away, he was just eaten away by his sadness and stopped . breathing.' Set alight: Prosecutors alleged that the professor started several fires around University High School in Irvine, where his son went until his death in March . Crime and punishment: Reinscheid's son, Claas Stubbe, was forced to pick up trash after stealing from the school store; he later hanged himself . Two nights later, while on medication . to stay awake and 'legally drunk' while downing a second bottle of . wine, Reinscheid wrote to himself about how he had fantasized about . having sex with every young girl he saw on campus that day. Then he discussed his 'dreams' of . mass murder at the high school, including explicit details of how he . planned to make a teacher get naked in front of students and stab . herself with a red pencil before he shot her in the head. 'I will make him die, slowly, surely. Next I try to burn down as much as I can, there should be nothing left that gives them a reason to continue their miserable school.' 'I will give myself a wonderful ending and be with Claas very soon,' he wrote. 'I like this plan, finally a good idea.' Reinscheid, a professor of . pharmaceutical sciences who also holds German citizenship, has not been . charged with anything related to the content of the emails because they . were private communications, said Farrah Emami, an Orange County . district attorney's spokeswoman. Defence attorney Ron Cordova did not . return multiple calls for comment. He told the judge in court Tuesday . that he didn't want his client to 'suffer from a media circus.' Bruce Blumberg, a pharmaceutical . colleague at UC Irvine, said Reinscheid was angry over the investigation . into his son's suicide and was considering legal action against the . school district. 'This is all a tragedy,' said . Blumberg. 'A boy is dead and he shouldn't be and his father is doing . allegedly crazy things that he shouldn't be doing. It's all a crazy . situation.' The son killed himself March 14 after . being ordered to pick up trash for stealing from the student store. After the suicide, rumours circulated around school that the teen had . been bullied, but police and the school district say they found no such . evidence. Gone too soon: His son hanged himself in Mason Park, pictured, in March; police did not find any drugs or alcohol in the teenager's system . Scene: In March, a maintenance worker found the boy's body in Mason Park, right; University High School can also be seen, bottom left . Ian Hanigan, a district spokesman, . said Reinscheid was angry with school administrators because they . informed the teen's stepsister of his death at the school, with no . family members present, after failing to reach anyone on her emergency . contact list. The school had no other complaints from Reinscheid after . his son's death and the professor hadn't threatened any school . administrators. Blumberg's wife, Dejoie, remains . close friends with Claas' mother, Doerte Stubbe. She said Claas seemed . affected by his parents' divorce and split time between Reinscheid and . his mother, who has multiple sclerosis. Tragic end: Claas Stubbe killed himself March 14 after being ordered to pick up trash for stealing from the student store . After the boy's death, Stubbe told her Reinscheid said he was writing 'goodbye letters' to everyone. 'At that point she said that she just . didn't care and I figured it was him grieving, venting and that sort of . thing. There was no threat,' Dejoie Blumberg said. 'I figured he was . very, very and extremely depressed - as any parent would be.' Longtime friend Olivier Civelli, . chairman of the pharmacology department, said Reinscheid was devastated . by his son's suicide but tried to keep it quiet at work. He showed no . signs of the deep anger evident in the emails. 'Rainer is not a violent person. Rainer never had a gun, I can tell you that,' said Civelli, who picked . up Reinscheid's car after his arrest last week. 'I think that maybe he . was doing that to vent his anger, he was telling (it) to someone who was . close - his wife.' That's an argument Reinscheid's . defence would likely use if the case goes to trial - and perhaps an . argument that could keep the emails away from a jury entirely, said . Jacqueline Goodman, a criminal defence attorney. His attorney will likely argue that Reinscheid never intended to act on his writings, and was simply expressing his anguish. Knowledge is power: Reinscheid is an associate professor Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences . 'You have to take into account the . context in which these writings come. He's so emotionally distressed and . now he's under the comingled influence of psychotropic drugs and . alcohol and he's writing these things - not acting on them - just . writing them down,' Goodman said. 'He's clearly not in his right mind. It's like writing in a diary.' When police searched Reinscheid's . car, they found a red folder containing a newly signed will and also . discovered a power of attorney document on his computer that gave his . wife control over his finances and children, according to a police . report obtained by The Associated Press.

A $12 million mansion has become the first property to face foreclosure in the celebrity-filled Hamptons enclave of Sagaponack after its real estate developer owner failed to pay his mortgage. Benjamin Ringel, president and CEO of Armstrong Realty Management, owes the Bank of Smithtown more than $7.1 million on the 10,670sqft property located on a three-acre expanse of the ultra-exclusive beachside resort, dubbed America's most expensive small town. The bank foreclosed last month on the lavish Sagg Main St residence, which boasts seven bedrooms, seven and a half bathrooms, four fire places, a cabana boat house, a pool, a tennis court and a jacuzzi. Foreclosure: Real-estate developer Benjamin Ringel is facing foreclosure on his $12 million Sagaponack mansion, pictured . The estate also comprises a second residence - a mid-century two bedroom, one bathroom home with 1,152Sqft of living space. According to the Town of Southampton tax records, Mr Ringel, 41, and his wife Yael bought the luxury property - worth $12,479,500 - in the real estate company's name in 2007 for an undisclosed sum. Court records show Smithtown went after the couple after they defaulted on their mortgage repayments in 2010. Mr Ringel, a regular donor to both Democrat and Republican campaigns, didn't dispute missing the payments but said he 'misplaced' the mortgage commitment letter sent by the bank and only found it after the commitment period set by the bank had expired. Village clerk Rosemarie Winchell said the pricey village, popular with second home owners, had around 500 residents and the assessed value of properties in the 4.6sq mile town was a whopping $4.2 billion. The median house price sits at $4.4 million, compared to $174,100 for homes in the U.S. generally. 'This is the first foreclosure I am aware of in the village,' Ms Winchell said. She added that Mr Ringel was owing two years' property taxes, totalling $1,497.41 but paid up on July 16.

The home is scheduled for a September auction after an August 27 date was postponed, according to The New York Post. But the family are fighting to hold on to the home. 'We expect this to be resolved,' Mr Ringel's lawyer Robert Calica told The Post. Sagaponack was named 'America's Most Expensive Small Town' by Bloomberg Businessweek for three years running. Connecting the communities of East Hampton and Southampton in New York's Long Island, the town is a magnet for celebrities, with TV comedian Jimmy Fallon owning property there and Beyonce and Jay Z's $400,000-a-month summer rental located in nearby Water Mill. Renco Group chairman Ira Rennert sparked controversy in 2004 when he built a 29-bedroom mansion, estimated to be worth more than $170 million, on a 63 acre estate in the town. Mr Ringel did not return MailOnline's call for comment.","Benjamin Ringel owes Bank of Smithtown more than $7.1 million after defaulting on mortgage in 2010 .

The unemployment rate rose slightly to 8.3 per cent last month as the number of job-seekers grew by 45,000, according to statistics released by the Labor Department today. Faced with the bad news for the economy, President Obama was today forced to admit that there are too many people out of work and vowed to do more on their behalf. However he also pointed to the continued growth of the private sector, which created 163,000 new jobs in July - the most in five months . Mitt Romney and Republicans jumped on the figures calling them a 'hammer blow' to middle class families as the new jobs failed to offset a growing number of Americans out of work.

'Not growing fast enough': President Barack Obama speaks to the press about the employment figures . Unemployed: New statistics by the Labor Department released today show that the unemployment rate across the nation rose to 8.3 per cent . The stock market has reacted positively to the news with stocks surging - as economists had predicted only 100,000 jobs would be added in July. Stocks rose sharply in midday trading. The . Dow Jones industrial average added 247 points to 13,126, while the . broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 28 points to 1,393. Romney says Americans deserve better than an unemployment rate that stays stubbornly stuck above 8 per cent. The unemployment rate has risen because number of people who classified as unemployed - over-16s actively looking for a job - rose by 45,000 while the size of the workforce shrank. However it is not known exactly what factors caused the ratio of unemployed Americans to increase. 'We've now gone 42 consecutive months with the unemployment rate above 8 per cent,' Romney said in a statement. 'Middle-class Americans deserve better, and I believe America can do better.' He says Obama 'doesn't have a plan' for boosting growth and his lackadaisical efforts have caused the once flourishing country to flounder. 'My plan will turn things around and bring the economy roaring back, with twelve million new jobs created by the end of my first term,' Romney said. In contrast, Obama told voters in Florida that his rival favors 'trickle-down tax cut fairy dust' that has failed to fix the economy in . the past. Romney's plan for job growth . included several broad ideas but few specifics. He said he would help . small business owners, cut spending to reduce the deficit and cut taxes.

White House economist Alan Krueger said Friday's report was evidence that the economy is recovering. 'It is critical that we continue the policies that build an economy that works for the middle class as we dig our way out of the deep hole that was caused by the severe recession that began in December 2007,' Krueger said. There was a silver lining in the new report, as U.S. employers added 163,000 jobs in July, a modest increase that could not combat the growing unemployment. The economy has added an average of 151,000 jobs a month this year, . roughly the same as last year's pace.

July's hiring was the best since February. Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for Hispanics (10.3 per cent) decreased in July, while the rates for adult men (7.7 per cent), adult women (7.5 per cent),teenagers (23.8 per cent), whites (7.4 per cent), and blacks (14.1 per cent) showed little or no change. In July, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks and over) was little changed at 5.2 million. These individuals accounted for 40.7 per cent of the unemployed. But 2.5 million Americans were found to be 'marginally attached to the labor force,' which means they were not working, they wanted a job and were available for work. That number has decreased since last year, when the number was 2.8 million. There were also less 'discouraged workers' from last year, which are persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for them. There were 267,000 less this year than last year. The growth was not able to outpace the job losses, however, and many pundits predict that a growing dissatisfaction with how Obama has steered the economy will be a major blow in November.","Unemployment hovers above 8 per cent for 42nd straight month .

The son of a man who was reported missing after going for a swim - but later turned up 700 miles away - has been charged with insurance fraud and filing a false report. Jonathan Roth, 22, was arrested on Monday, said Nassau County District Attorney's office. He was also charged with conspiracy to commit insurance fraud. Roth claimed he had nothing to do with the actions of his father, 47-year-old Raymond Roth who allegedly tried to fake his own death. He vanished on July 28 after going into the water at Jones Beach, New York. The unemployed computer engineer was discovered five days later after being stopped for speeding in South Carolina. Wasting police time: Raymond Roth, 47 (right) turned up in South Carolina after going missing from Jones Beach in Long Island. His son Jonathan has been charged with insurance fraud . His son had reported him missing causing a massive air and water search, costing thousands of dollars. Jonathan Roth said yesterday he feared his father was coming to kill him after his stepmother exposed emails she found between the two, detailing a plan to disappear and play dead. Mrs Roth has since filed for divorce and taken a restraining order against her husband. She also said she was afraid for her life after revealing the information and claims her husband is abusive. Mr Roth was accused of wasting police time after his son reported that he drifted out to sea. His shoes, clothes, . wallet and cellphone were all found on Jones Beach. Jonathan Roth said he never received incriminating emails from his father and that there was no way his stepmother could have had access to the computer. He denied being involved in Mr Roth's plan and said he still isn't certain why his father wants to kill him. After Jonathan told . police that his father had disappeared on July 28 during his daily swim at the . Long Island beach, a huge search operation took place that lasted until last Wednesday. It was suspended when Mrs Roth came across suspicious emails between the father and son, sent in the days before his disappearance. Coincidentally, Mr Roth was pulled over by police in Santee, South Carolina for speeding on Thursday morning. Filed for divorce: Mrs Roth said she has no idea where her husband is and has taken out a restraining order . Organized: Raymond Roth left his shoes, wallet, clothing and phone on Jones Beach, Long Island . Mrs Roth says her stepson is lying about his involvement in the disappearance.  According to the emails she discovered, Mr Roth told his son: 'Do Not allow that a**hole to give the house away.' In the alleged emails, dated from . the day before the disappearance, Roth wrote to his son: 'I need to . get to the bank for cash for the trip.' He added: 'about the jewelry we spoke of . yesterday, you need to whisper in [a relative’s] ear about it and do not . worry she will get it,' and, 'tell [another relative] I handed you the . papers -- then you JUST noticed that there was an envelope with [his] . name on it (the last Will and Testemnet [sic]) then hand it to him.' In the emails seen by the New York Post, Mr Roth sent his son three messages within ten minutes on the morning of Friday, July 27. Long way home: Police stopped Roth as he sped . down a highway in Santee, South Carolina, more than 730 miles from the . spot where he went missing . Search and rescue: Raymond Roth, 47, of Massapequa, was reported missing by his 22-year-old son Jonathan . In the first email, Mr Roth instructs his son to call him with an update on Sunday. 'There needs to be a way for me to find out how things are going. Call me Sunday night at 8pm at the resort,' explained Mr Roth. 'You cannot call from your phone,’ the father allegedly warned. 'Go to a pay phone or borrow your friends phone. 'You must call within 15 minutes of the determined call time in order to be sure I will be available.' His wife said during the press conference last week: 'On the day he went to the beach, he told me he was going to his mother’s house. 'I said, ''How long are you going to be? Are you going to be home for dinner?'' 'He said, ''I’ll be home in an hour.''' Three hours later, her stepson Jonathan called to tell her that her husband had not come out of the water and was presumed drowned. Nassau County police confirmed that Jonathan Roth dialled 911 to report his father missing near Jones Beach’s Field 6 where there are no lifeguards. A . neighbor of the family said that he saw Jonathan after his father had been missing for two days and that the man told him, 'My dad’s . gone, my dad’s dead.'

Woodland view: National Trust worker Emily Utgren by the enormous tree, left, and the tree from a distance, right . This one, however, has grown thinner and . higher, thanks to the other trees that crowd the same ancient copse, . with which it must compete for light.

National Trust experts have measured it by laser at a height of 131ft (40 metres) but its official height will be confirmed . when experts from The Tree Register climb it and drop a tape measure . from the highest twig. Stourhead boasts arguably the finest collection of trees in the country and already has the fattest Common Lime and the tallest Macedonian Pine. Emily Utgen, a National Trust gardener and arboreal specialist, said: 'We’ve measured it with a laser from various angles and it is between 39 and 42 metres high. Green shoots: The tree has grown thinner and higher than most because it is surrounded by other trees and has fought for the light . 'The highest oak at present is 40 metres but we think that will have to be re-measured and we’re confident this will be the tallest. 'It will be officially measured by someone from the Tree Register who will climb to the top and drop a line from the highest branch. 'This has grown so high for a number of reasons, one of which is because it is surrounded by other trees in an 'oak stand'. 'This means it is drawn to the light but also the other trees protect it so it doesn’t need the strength of anchorage that it would if it were on its own. Perfect conditions: The soil in the area is excellent, the conditions moist and the anchorage already in place thanks to other plants . 'Those types of oaks tend to be short and stumpy. It is also in a natural, mixed woodland and nothing is taken away from it. 'The soil is excellent and there is a good amount of leaf mould as well as green-sand and clay. 'The leaf mould help retains the moisture so it never dries out even in a drought. And it is on a north facing slope so it is shaded. 'It has been completely untouched and you can see broken branches and things. 'We don’t know if it was planted deliberately or whether it just grew naturally from an acorn.'

Accused: Melanie Garcia, 21, left, initially said the injuries were caused by a fall, but in court last week she claims her ex-boyfriend Matthew Carrillo, 23, right, beat the child to death for dropping food on the floor . The gruesome details were revealed when Miss Garcia gave evidence at a preliminary . hearing for her ex-boyfriend Matthew Carrillo according to the San Antonio Express-News. Both Carrillo and Garcia have . been charged with causing serious bodily injury to a child after Kayla . died from her injuries on May 9, 2012. Prosecutors in Houston, Texas, said they are considering bringing capital murder charges that could lead to the death penalty. Garcia told the court her boyfriend allegedly carried out the beating because her daughter had dropped a meatball from her sandwich as they walked home from a Subway restaurant. He had lived with the women for six months preceding the incident, officers told the MailOnline . She also said he was angry that she was walking too slow and when they reached home the punishment began. Carrillo then had the child pull down her pants and underwear and brace herself against a couch. Tragedy: Garcia brought Kayla Garcia to San Antonio's Christus Santa Rosa Children's Hospital, where employees called police when they saw the girl covered in bruises and cigarette burns . Home: Carrillo lived with the women for six months at this San Antonio address preceding the incident . Sandwich: Both Carrillo and Garcia have been charged with causing serious bodily injury to a child after Kayla died from her injuries on May 9, 2012 . When the child threw herself to the floor as Carrillo struck her, he picked her up by one arm and began hitting her all over with his belt as she dangled in front of him, Garcia said. He then had her lift a phone book and a box parallel to the ground for an extended period, Garcia said. She claimed Carrillo slapped the child and pushed her to the ground, causing her to hit her head. When Garcia was rushed to hospital . after she stopped breathing doctors found her body covered in bruises, . including on her genitals, a burn on her thigh and her retinas hemorrhaging. Playful: Garcia also said Carrillo was angry at the girl for walking too slow and when they reached home the punishment began . Garcia said she told paramedics her daughter had hit her head after falling out of her toy wagon. She told the court Carrillo had ordered her to lie to authorities and was terrified of him and his family. 'She used to tell him that he was her best friend,' Garcia said through tears of her daughter and Carrillo, who was living with them at the time of the death. 'It wasn't supposed to happen like this. I love my daughter.' Lawyers for Carrillo said Garcia is bipolar and was cooperating with authorities to avoid any of the blame. She has two previous arrests for drug possession, documents show. Garcia said she was told by prosecutors she could still face charges. Beaten: Carrillo then had the child pull down her pants and underwear and brace herself against a couch . Child services were called to the couple's home in March of this year on child abuse accusations. 'We located the child and the mom, took photographs, interviewed the gentleman involved and we found nothing,' Mary Walker, an agency spokeswoman for Child Protective Services, said to the San Antonio Express-News. 'Although a case worker conducted a thorough investigation, no evidence of abuse was found at the time.' The investigation occurred only two months before Kayla died. 'It's absolutely tragic,' Mrs Walker said. 'Sometimes we see what they want us to see. We rely on people to tell us what's true, and that doesn't always work out.' Melanie Garcia was released from jail without bail after agreeing to submit to a lie detector test and to testify against Carrillo if necessary. Carrillo's bid to be freed from jail due to lack of probable cause was denied by Magistrate Judge Andrew Carruthers, but he did order his bond reduced from $200,000 to $100,000. Kayla was buried on May 16 in the San Fernando Cemetery.","Kayla Garcia, 4, died on May 9 after she was allegedly beaten by her mother's ex-boyfriend .

Laura Bechtolshimer in action this afternoon in an historic day for Great Britain . This year's Team GB is the most successful to represent the country since 1908, when comparatively few countries took part in sporting events. In Britain's best-ever Olympics of 1908, the country claimed an unsurpassable 146 medals - 56 golds, 51 silvers and 39 bronze.

The medal-winning success also, in particular, represents an about-turn for Great Britain's dressage team since the 'dark days' recently referred to by Hester. Team GB's dressage team competed at successive Olympic Games for many years without success, which makes their gold medal success to tip Team GB's 2012 team into the record books perhaps all the more impressive. Team dressage has been dominated by Germany in every Games since 1984 - but the magic of London 2012 meant that this was yet another bastion to fall to an apparently unstoppable Team GB. A home crowd saw Britain's dressage team win an historic first ever medal at Greenwich Park . Britain's Carl Hester, pictured riding Uthopia to a first gold medal in the dressage competition this afternoon . Britain's gold-medal winning success in the Dressage event took place in the iconic surroundings of Greenwich Park . The three riders - who were on the verge of winning gold after enjoying a marginal points cushion ahead of their German rivals - managed to hold onto their top podium position in an impressive display this afternoon. Carl Hester on Uthopia, Charlotte Dujardin on Valegro and Laura Bechtolsheimer on Mistral Hojris, managed an almost flawless display at the iconic Greenwich arena to bag the gold medals. Charlotte Dujardin, who was the last of the British team to compete in the event this afternoon, has enjoyed a meteoric rise in the sport since competing in a grand prix in dressage for the first time in 2011. And in a sport which has received relatively little publicity, the contrast in backgrounds between two of Team GB's riders make for a touching back story.

German-born Laura Bechtolsheimer, 27, . who moved to Gloucestershire when she was one, is the granddaughter of . German billionaire property magnate Karl-Heinz Kipp. Her family own her horse Mistral Hojris, known as Alf, and her father Wilfried is a breeder and trainer. Charlotte Dujardin, on the other hand, was born in Enfield, north London, and got her major break when she went to work on veteran British competitor Carl Hester's yard for 10 days in 2007 and was offered a full-time job as a rider. The 27-year-old, now also based in Gloucestershire, left school at 16 and went to work for international dressage judge Judy Harvey for four years, before being employed by Hester. She now trains clients including New Zealand legend Mark Todd. Despite their contrasting personal backgrounds, Dujardin and Bechtolsheimer have already seen record-breaking success as part of the British team. Led by Hester, and along with Emile Faurie, they won a gold medal at the European Championships last year, achieving the highest score in the competition's history. To commemorate the fantastic win, he only post box on Channel Island Sark will be painted gold in honour of Olympian Carl Hester. Hester, 45, left the island at the age of 16 to pursue his dream of an equestrian career but said he is 'very proud' of his birthplace. He and team mates Laura Bechtolsheimer and Charlotte Dujardin, 27, today won gold - Britain's first ever Olympic medal in the dressage. Hester, who now lives in Gloucestershire, said: 'I think that's really fantastic. I'm very proud of that place where I come from. I know those people are very excited to have an Olympian from the Channel Islands.' He said people living on the island missed out on a visit from the Olympic torch as it went on a relay around Britain. 'They were very upset that the flame didn't go to Sark when it went around the countryside, it went to Guernsey instead. Well, if you come from Sark Guernsey's a dirty word. It didn't go to my island and I was the one coming here. 'So the fact that they now get a gold letterbox is just outstanding. I'm very delighted that they've recognised that and that's where I come from, so hooray.' Cassandra Morris, from Guernsey Post, told the BBC the post box will be transformed in the next few days. She said: 'This is the first time that Guernsey Post has changed the colour of Sark's post box since it was painted blue in 1980, 11 years after the company became independent from the British Post Office. 'The plans for transforming Sark's post box are well under way and Guernsey Post hopes to have the post box finished in just a few days.' Those unfamiliar with the world of dressage would be forgiven for wondering exactly what was happening today at Greenwich Park. It may not look as challenging as the imposing fences on a cross-country course or possess the theatrical element of showjumping, but dressage is a highly technical discipline which demands huge skill and precision from both horse and rider. In the team event, the pair must ride two 'tests', with the rider memorising a series of movements that are performed in front of a set of judges. These are designed to put the horses through their paces and include complex manoeuvres such as a pirouette - where the animal effectively turns a full circle, with its hind-quarters at the centre. In other movements, the horse appears to 'skip' across the arena. The objective is for the combination to work calmly together with top marks going to the most elegant and accurate partnerships. A mark out of 10 is awarded for each movement, with the total score shown as a percentage at the culmination of a test. The results for the three riders in each team are then added together. A final score is determined by combining the marks for the two tests. Dressage has been an Olympic sport since 1912. It was a discipline reserved for army officers until 1952 when it became a mixed event. The last seven Olympic titles have been won by Germany.

Wanted: Kemen Uranga, 43, has been detained in London on an extradition warrant and is accused of storing explosives and killing a judge . A suspected Basque terrorist who was on the run for 12 years has been arrested in Britain. Kemen Uranga, 43, was detained on an international arrest warrant today in London and is wanted for the murder of a Spanish judge. Uranga, an . alleged member of an ETA command unit in the Basque province of Vizcaya, . is believed to have shot dead Spanish judge Jose Lidon at his home in . November 2001 with an accomplice. He was already on the run from security forces a year before allegedly committing the crime. Since 2000 it is also alleged he aided previously unknown members of Eta by finding them accommodation and storing explosives. Artola, who featured on a 2002 American government’s list of wanted terrorists, will now appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court for an extradition hearing. The Met said today his arrest was not related to the Olympics. He is the fourth man linked to the outlawed terror organisation ETA to be arrested in Britain in the past six weeks. Killer Antonio Troitino, convicted of 22 murders including a car bomb attack which killed five police officers in Madrid in 1986, was held along with an ETA explosives expert at a house in Hounslow, west London, at the end of June. ETA fugitive Benat Atorrasagasti was arrested last month as he walked out of a pub in Leith, Scotland. Spain’s Interior Ministry confirmed the arrest today and said Uranga had been living in Kentish Town. 'Kemen Uranga, who went on the run in the year 2000 after the Vizcaya command unit was smashed, stored explosives for this terrorist group and provided safe houses for members,' a spokesman said. End: A municipal worker paints over graffiti reading 'ETA, The People Are With You' in Guernica, Spain, but despite a ceasefire the separatist group still has several leaders on the run . Uranga is the tenth ETA suspect held in the UK since 2007. Anti-terrorism experts say Britain became a favourite bolt-hole for ETA terrorists after France began cooperating with Spain to track down fugitives living there. Last July police held ETA chief Eneko Gogeaskoetxea, 44, at a house in Cambridge. He had been living there with his wife and two children under an assumed name and was a member of the local squash club. Gogeaskoetxea was wanted in Spain for . attempting to assassinate King Juan Carlos at the opening of the . Guggenheim museum in Bilbao in 1997. String of arrests: Last year Eneko Gogeaskoetxea was found in Cambridge and was wanted for trying to kill the King of Spain at the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao . Spanish intelligence sources say there are around 180 ETA terrorists on the run. ETA has killed more than 800 people since it launched its campaign for an independent Basque state in the late 1960s. In January last year the group announced a 'permanent ceasefire' following more than 40 years of bloodshed. The terrorist group is being urged to hand over its weapons and make a public apology to victims.","Kemen Uranga is the fourth member of the terror group to be arrested in the UK in six weeks .

A leading economist has thrown the popular 'Lipstick Effect' theory into doubt, suggesting that the research behind it is based on 'over-generalised gender stereotypes'. The well-known phenomenon suggests that women buy less-expensive luxury goods, such as cosmetics, in tough economic times in a bid to increase their attractiveness to mates. But now Julie Nelson, from the University of Massachusetts, Boston, has stated that the 'overly general' findings only serve to reinforce 'stereotypes about women's lives - and social value - centering on questions of their attractiveness to men.' Finishing touch: An economist has questioned the so-called 'lipstick effect' suggesting that it has less to do with human nature and more with over-generalising gender stereotypes . She told ABC News that the theory is 'a gross over-generalization' adding that recent studies aiming to give it scientific status came from a narrow sub-class of women - young university students within the U.S. Also that the phenomenon only applies to 'women who reported themselves to be . highly motivated to attract a male romantic partner, but not among young . women with low motivation'. She added: 'Along with young women not looking for a partner, it is not . at all clear that older women, married women, lesbian women, or women . from other educational and cultural backgrounds would share this . so-called 'women's psychology.' Opposition: Julie Nelson, from the University of Massachusetts, Boston, has thrown the popular 'Lipstick Effect' theory into doubt . Nelson . said it is 'plausible' that the purchase of beauty products and make-up is an . evolutionary outcome of competition for mates, but it 'is a far cry from it being scientifically demonstrated.' She . pointed out the study's results suggest that maintaining one's appearance in . the face of adversity, might be a stronger motivation than the . desire to attract a mate and it would be valuable to repeat similar research with older married women. In the paper Boosting Beauty in an Economic Decline: Mating, Spending, and the Lipstick Effect, which was published last month . researchers from Texas Christian University, University of Minnesota, . University of Texas at San Antonio and Arizona State University, . presented five studies. Following evolutionary theories,Sarah Hill, co-author of the study said:'We may not consciously think we’re buying them to make ourselves more desirable to men. 'But our lizard brains go after these things even when we think we’re too smart to be lured in by manipulative advertising claims like, ‘these jeans will help get you a man.’ For the study 154 university students including 82 women and 72 men were presented with fictitious articles highlighting the recession. The participants were then asked if the content caused them to think there were fewer physically attractive suitors available with a steady job and income and the majority answered 'yes'. The participants were then asked, based on their gender, about their desire to purchase six products. Three products enhanced physical . appearance including two fashion items and a lipstick for women and . facial cream for men. The other three products were a wireless mouse, . stapler and headphones. While men's purchasing desires were not effected, women in the recession condition demonstrated a 'significant interaction between priming condition and product type' opting for products that would enhance their appearance. Defending the findings Vlad Griskevicius, one of the co-authors of the paper from the University of Minnesota argued that the work was 'grounded in theory about universal human nature rather than cultural stereotypes', although he  admitted that further research is needed.","Leading economist Julie Nelson says theory reinforces gender stereotypes .

Makes history: Norma Graham is the first chief constable to appear in court as the accused in Scottish legal history . Scotland's first female chief constable is to stand trial after she denied causing a head-on car crash which left another woman injured. Norma Graham, the Chief Constable of Fife Constabulary, was involved in a collision earlier this year as she drove to work at the force’s headquarters outside Glenrothes, Fife. She and another motorist, Hannah Shedden, were taken to hospital following the accident on the B922 Cluny to Kinglassie road. Her unmarked dark blue Audi Quattro and Miss Shedden’s Renault Clio were both badly damaged. Now . Graham, 49, who earns £120,000 a year and is set to retire in three . weeks’ time, faces a charge of careless driving over the incident. It . is thought this is the first time in Scottish legal history that a . chief constable has been cited to appear in court as an accused. Yesterday was the third time the case has called in court – with the top officer again absent. It had earlier been continued without a plea being entered twice, with lawyers saying they needed time to complete ‘investigations’ into the case. Scene of the crash: Graham is charged with careless driving after she collided head-on with another vehicle on this bend of the B922 Cluny to Kinglassie road . Her solicitor, Sally McKenzie, told Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court that Graham denied driving on the B922 Cluny to Kinglassie road on February 7 without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road. It is alleged that Graham failed to keep the vehicle under proper control and caused it to collide with Miss Shedden’s vehicle. Prosecutors say that, as a result, both vehicles were damaged and both she and Miss Shedden were injured. Sheriff Richard Macfarlane set a trial date in December and ordered Graham to appear at a pre-trial hearing in November. A spokesman for Fife Constabulary declined to comment on the case. Chief Constable Graham joined Lothian and Borders Police as a cadet in 1978 aged 16. She started her career two years later as a bobby on the beat in her home town of Musselburgh, East Lothian. Graham later rose to the rank of detective chief superintendent in charge of criminal investigation. During the early part of her  career she undertook a number of uniformed and specialist roles including head of the force drug squad. Denies charge: Through her solicitor, Graham denied driving carelessly at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court . She was appointed assistant chief constable of Central Scotland Police in 2002 and in 2005 was strategic gold commander for the G8 summit held at Gleneagles, Perthshire, a role that saw her assume overall control of police activity at the summit. She later moved to Fife as deputy chief constable and was awarded the Queen’s Police Medal for Services to Policing in 2008. In July that year Graham was promoted to chief constable. The next year, she was made vice-president of the Association of Chief Police Officers Scotland, a position she held until last year. Graham has been involved in operational policing on a national level in firearms, emergency  planning and resilience, public order and Olympic planning. It had been thought she would be a front runner to lead Scotland’s new single police force next year. But in April she unexpectedly announced that she was to retire in August. She said then: ‘It has been an honour to serve Fife as chief constable for the last four years and a privilege to lead the dedicated officers and police staff who over the last seven years have been instrumental in almost halving crime in the kingdom – a reduction of 49 per cent. ‘It is the same officers and staff who will deliver for local communities regardless of police reform.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Chief Constable Norma Graham denied causing a head-on crash which left a woman injured .

No doubt Zara's proud husband will be supporting his wife of one year at the trials. Throughout the Olympics England rugby player Mike Tindall was one of Team GB's most vocal cheerleaders, ferociously tweeting his support for Zara and her teammates Nicola Wilson, William Fox-Pitt, Mary King and Kristina Cook. He even admitted that her winning the silver medal better was better than lifting the rugby World Cup. He said: 'That Olympic silver, in my book, is right up there with my World Cup medal, if not above it, because it was won at the London Games with so much expectation and pressure. ‘When England won the World Cup we were favourites to do so. Team GB’s eventing silver wasn’t expected, so to produce that collective performance was outstanding.' Zara Phillips and the Great Britain eventing team Nicola Wilson, William Fox-Pitt, Mary King and Kristina Cook show off their silver medals . Eventing is an equestrian triathlon combining three different disciplines in one competition set out over one, two, or three days, depending on the length of courses and number of entries. Sometimes known as 'Horse Trials' the event features dressage, show jumping and cross-country and uses a penalty point scoring system. Eventing is considered to be the ultimate test of equestrian skills. The first phase, dressage, shows the horse's and rider’s ability to perform a series of prescribed classical movements on the flat in an enclosed arena. The second phase, cross-country, involves the horse and rider galloping over natural terrain, jumping a variety of fixed obstacles along the way. The third phase, show jumping, sees the horse and rider jump a series of stadium fences in an enclosed arena.","Royal competing in dressage, show jumping and cross-country event .

The jab developed by scientists in Sweden could delay the onset of the debilitating illness and be the first step towards finding a cure. Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia and attacks nerves, brain cells and neurotransmitters that carry messages to and from the brain. New hope: The jab could delay the onset of the debilitating illness and be the first step towards finding a cure (picture posed by model) The vaccine, known as CAD10, helps patients create protective antibodies to defend against deposits that develop in the brain of sufferers. Researchers from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and from the Swedish Brain Power Network claimed in the Lancet Neurology journal that their discovery could help people with mild to moderate versions of Alzheimer's. They found no serious side effects during the tests, which took place over three years on people aged between 50 and 80. One in 14 people over 65 years old is affected by the disease, according to the Alzheimer’s Society. The risks increase with age, with around one in six people over 80 years old developing the condition. Scientists hope CAD106 can delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease by five years. Campaigner: Sci-fi author Terry Pratchett suffers from Alzheimer's and has fronted TV documentaries on the subject . According to the World Health . Organisation, dementia is currently the fastest growing global health . epidemic. In the UK, 820,000 people have a form of dementia with more than half suffering from Alzheimer’s. The figure is set to rise to a million in less than 10 years. Alzheimer's may be caused by a 'perfect storm' of minor gene alterations, new research shows. A number of inactive or over-active genes - rather than individual severe mutations - may be the origin of neurodegenerative disorders, according to a report in journal PLoS Genetics. Every healthy person has gene varients which express themselves in slightly different ways. On their own they have a modest effect, but taken together can lead to problems, said Dr Nilufer Ertekin-Taner, of Florida's Mayo clinic. She added: 'If we can identify the genes linked to a disease that are too active or too dormant, we might be able to define new drug targets and therapies.' Dr Simon Ridley, Head of Research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: 'Already half a million people in the UK are living with Alzheimer’s disease, and we urgently need new treatments that can offer hope for the future. 'For the best chance of success, we need to see many more treatments being trialled in this way, and that means a huge investment in research. 'Long-term, larger scale trials of CAD106 will determine whether it can help people’s memory and thinking skills, as well as reducing the amount of amyloid in the brain. 'Amyloid begins to build in the brain long before symptoms of Alzheimer’s appear, and it’s likely that any new treatment will be most effective when given in the early stages of the disease.' The researchers found 74 per cent of the people taking CAD106 had increased levels of antibodies in their blood after having the vaccine, suggesting that the vaccine had triggered their immunity. The authors called it a 'promising option in the treatment of mild-to-moderate . Alzheimer’s disease.' In an accompanying article, Thomas . Wisniewski from the New York School of Medicine wrote: 'Development of an . immunotherapy that can delay Alzheimer’s disease onset by five years . would reduce the prevalence of the disease by half.

An Army wife with a rare eye condition faces going blind unless health chiefs fund sight-saving treatment. Dawn Thomas says her local Primary Care Trust (PCT) has denied her the medication despite it being available on the NHS in other parts of the country. The mother-of-one fears her family will have to sell their home to pay for private care as a result. Dawn Thomas, is already suffering from sight problems, and is now battling for treatment on the NHS . 'If the PCT doesn't fund the treatment it will condemn me to blindness,' the 44-year-old said. 'I would have to give up my job and driving - it would be life-changing and devastating.' South Staffordshire PCT initially told the lance corporal's wife that it would not fund the treatment injections that can cost up to £800 each. However, the trust has since decided to review its decision after it received further information about Mrs Thomas' case from the Macular Disease Society. Mrs Thomas, from Branston, Staffordshire, who has almost lost vision in her left eye and is having trouble with her other eye, said: 'We are now thinking of selling our house to fund the treatment privately.' Although Mrs Thomas was diagnosed with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) when she was 21, it has only given her serious cause for concern in the past 12 months. After suffering headaches and worsening vision in her left eye at the turn of the year, she saw a consultant at Burton's Queen's Hospital who allegedly attributed her problems to her glasses and told her to return in a year. Concerned, Mrs Thomas saw her GP and two months later was seen at the Royal Derby Hospital by another consultant, who spotted abnormal blood vessels and the appearance of a bleed in her left eye. Treatment: Lucentis injections proved effective in treating PXE sight problems in trials . Another expert at the hospital confirmed the findings and said treatment was available - but not on the NHS. He supported Mrs Thomas's funding bid to the PCT but it sent her a letter saying her case was not 'exceptional enough'. Mrs Thomas said: 'I've worked all my life, always paid my national insurance and thought I would never have a problem getting treatment on the NHS. 'I thought the NHS was healthcare for everyone but since I've gone through all this I feel like they don't care about people. 'It's about whether they meet their expenditure targets. They just seem so heartless. As far as I know, people in other PCTs are getting it - so why can't I?' An NHS spokesman said the original decision not to fund Mrs Thomas's treatment was 'being reviewed'. 'This is following the receipt of further information from the Macular Disease Society, who are acting on behalf of Mrs Thomas,' he said. 'The decision will be reviewed and examined by our clinically-led panel and a decision should be taken within a month.' CANCER . Patients with suspected cancer in parts of England are 60 times more . likely to be sent for scans than those living elsewhere, according to a study by the National Cancer Intelligence Network in July. While a GP practice in Sefton, Merseyside, referred 5,591 per 100,000, another in Hillingdon, London, referred only 89 per 100,000. DIABETES . Only six per cent of sufferers received the recommended levels . of care in some areas compared to 69 per cent in the highest-achieving primary care trusts . (PCTs), a National Audit Office (NAO) report found in May. The worst offenders were Mid Essex and Swindon PCTs. ARTHRITIS . There is almost a three-fold variation in the amount of money primary care trusts . across England spend on arthritis services, a study revealed in April. NHS Hartlepool spent £764 per patient in 2009-10, but NHS Peterborough only . £275, according to the Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Alliance. Mrs Thomas needs anti-vascular endothelial growth factor medications (anti-VEGFs), which slow sight loss by stopping blood vessels forming or growing. The deterioration, known as wet macular degeneration, can be treated by three drugs: Macugen, Avastin and Lucentis. Repeated injections into the eye are usually required. The treatment has been found to be very successful at preserving vision of PXE patients in clinical trials. PXE is a hereditary disorder in which the elastic fibres that normally occur in the skin, eyes and cardiovascular system gradually become calcified and cause characteristic symptoms in each area. It is estimated about one in 25,000 people in the world have PXE, but recent indications are that it is more common. Approximately 60 per cent of PXE sufferers develop eye problems and many experience the loss of some central vision. The Royal National Institute of the Blind said South Staffordshire PCT had made a 'cruel decision.' Steve Winyard, head of campaigns and policy, said: 'The refusal of her PCT to fund an effective and proven treatment is a cruel decision that is likely to mean Mrs Thomas has to stop working. 'There will be a massive impact on her quality of life and a big long-term cost to the taxpayer. 'If there's an approved treatment available which will save a person's sight then it should be given. 'It's vital people diagnosed with sight-threatening conditions have the opportunity to receive proven and timely treatments.'","Dawn Thomas  has almost lost vision in her left eye and is having trouble with her right eye .

A teenager has baffled doctors with an infection never recorded before in medical history. Blake Munton, 16, from Grimsby, has lived with a brain tumour for eight years but is now recovering from a rare medical first. After six operations and contracting meningitis, doctors discovered a fungal infection, called aspergillis, had spread from his stomach, up the shunt and into his brain - something which has never been recorded before. Doctors at Sheffield Children's Hospital controlled the infection just in time and Blake finally returned home this month. Blake has a brain tumour, which doctors have shrunk using radiotherapy. Pictured with his mother Carol and father Brian . He still has the aspergillis infection but it is now being controlled, although he has no idea how it will affect him in the future. In 2004, Blake was rushed to hospital after suffering a seizure in Cuba while on holiday with his parents, Brian and Carol, and an MRI scan revealed he had a large tumour in the back of his head. It had caused a fluid build-up in his brain, which had been causing dizziness for nearly a year, so Cuban surgeons fitted a shunt to release the fluid into his stomach. Since then, he has had radiotherapy in Sheffield to shrink the tumour and four more shunts fitted in the UK, but six months ago his stomach became bloated, so his parents took him back to Sheffield. After draining the fluid, doctors discovered aspergillis on the shunt fitted in Cuba, so he underwent a second operation, this time lasting four hours, to remove it. Blake still faces a battle with his health but is glad to be back at home . Blake continued to suffer with the infection, despite drips pumping his body with antibiotics and antifungicides all day long for weeks. Doctors operated again to remove another shunt and install one on the outside of his head, which released fluid into a bag. Unfortunately, a stitch burst and he contracted meningitis through the wound. Doctors upped the dose of antibiotics to fight the disease as, by this point, Blake's immune system was almost totally inactive. Blake then had another operation to remove the exterior shunt and fit another on the other side of his head, yet nothing seemed to be working and doctors were baffled. They contacted neurosurgeons worldwide, but none identified the problem. A cloudy area on a brain scan revealed that aspergillis had spread from his stomach, up the shunt and into his brain something that had never been recorded in history. He said: 'I am just so glad to be back coming home is all I have thought about since going to hospital.' Father Brian, 44, said: 'There were a couple of times when we thought we might lose him. 'The doctors were trying to save his life but he spent so long on antibiotics that his immune system was shot, which made many treatments impossible. 'No one has ever had this kind of infection on the brain before so we have no idea what will happen we are totally blind. 'We are just enjoying having him home and think it is amazing how well he is doing.' Mother Carol, 51, said: 'He has been incredibly brave throughout. No matter what happened, he never grumbled and has kept us laughing every day. I am so glad to have him home.'","Blake, 16, has battled a brain tumour, meningitis and a fungal infection that spread to his brain .

Depressed: Dr Clive Blackburn jumped to his death from the roof of Unilever in Bedfordshire just hours after being made redundant from his high-powered job . A top food scientist jumped to his death from the roof of his work laboratory just hours after being made redundant, an inquest has heard. Dr Clive Blackburn - who developed products for big brand names including Slimfast and Lipton Tea - could not cope with losing his position at food giant Unilever, so meticulously planned his death. He went to the deserted Unilever building on a Saturday - the day after finishing work for the last time - and duped security staff by saying he was collecting personal belongings. The 48-year-old planned his suicide even adding the date of his death and the length of his employment at the Unilever development laboratories on a social networking site the day before he died. He had not been able to handle being made redundant and saw his GP on several occasions leading up to his death complaining of depression. Coroner David Morris told the . inquest: 'He was made redundant with his last working day on November . 11. 'It appears he gained access to the building at around 4pm on . November 12 having asked security for his swipe card to collect his . belongings. 'Security staff became concerned when they couldn’t locate him after several hours and called the police. 'His body was eventually found lying on grass on the grounds of the site. 'The cause of his death was recorded as multiple bone and soft tissue injuries, consistent with a fall from height.' Paramedics were called to the Unilever site in Sharnbrook, Bedfordshire, in the early hours of November 13 but the eminent doctor, who was influential in the food science world, was pronounced dead at the scene. His body was found . on a grassed area at the back of the complex. Scene of tragedy: Colworth Science Park in Sharnbrook, near Bedford, where Dr Clive Blackburn threw himself off the roof of his laboratory . He was told by company directors that he was at risk of being made redundant last May and colleagues reported him behaving strangely at work after that point, the inquest in Bedford heard. He regularly saw his GP, Dr Jonathan Wali, suffering from depression and confided that he felt he had no hope for the future. He told his GP that he was turning up for work and 'going through the motions' but had been dreading being out of work. He was being considered for second interviews for potential jobs but Dr Blackburn told his GP his last day at the company was 'looming large in his thoughts.' Talented: Dr Blackburn worked on big brand names including Slimfast and Lipton Tea . Dr Blackburn had worked at the company for 15 years and had updated his profile on social network site LinkedIn shortly before his death to read 1963 - 2011 and the end of employment with Unilever as November 2011, after three years and three months as the Group Leader, Drinks Design department.

Scientists at Manchester University have discovered spuds contain unique antibacterial molecules that can treat the condition. Members of the university’s microbiology team now hope the substance, dubbed ‘potato juice’ could go into production as a daily diet supplement. Potatoes contain unique antibacterial molecules that can treat the condition . Inspiration came as one of the department’s scientists tucked into a spud for Sunday lunch. It led to the discovery of a key molecule which could both cure and prevent the bacteria that lives in the stomach and causes stomach ulcers and heartburn. The discovery is one of many being made by scientists at the university as they try to develop the products and medicines of tomorrow. Uniquely, unlike with antibiotics, the stomach bacteria cannot develop resistance to the ‘potato juice’ which also does not cause any side-effects. Scientists at the university even carried out the test on different types of potatoes - discovering Maris Piper and King Edward varieties worked the best. The process to extract the as yet unnamed molecule has now been patented, with hopes it could one day be sold as a supplement similar to probiotic yoghurt drinks. Professor Ian Roberts was part of the team that made the molecule discovery . Ian Roberts, professor of microbiology at the Faculty of Life Sciences, who worked on the discovery, said: 'One of our scientists was having Sunday lunch when her boyfriend’s grandma said they used to use potatoes to cure stomach ulcers. 'Afterwards she went and bought a bag of King Edwards from a shop on Curry Mile and started testing them in the lab. 'When I first heard about the idea of using potatoes to treat stomach ulcers I have to admit I was a bit sceptical. But on another level I wasn’t surprised - a lot of botanical products have very interesting compounds and we just have to find them. 'We see this ‘potato juice’ as a preventative measure to stop stomach ulcers developing that people would take as part of a healthy lifestyle. It could be a huge market if we can get it developed.' The discovery of ‘potato juice’ is just one of a number of new medicines and treatments being developed by staff at the University of Manchester’s intellectual property department. Staff there seek out companies from across the world to develop the university’s inventions. Business manager Dr Sunita Jones said: 'It is really exciting to see these new discoveries - they cover all areas of science so it really keeps us on our toes. 'As a scientist, the end goal of any work is to put something into the public arena which will benefit people. 'We work to develop all the new technology that comes out of the university, by getting licensing agreements or forming spin-out companies. It’s great to see years of research pay off with a new drug or product at the end.'",Scientist at Manchester University was told of the potato's curative properties by her boyfriend's grandma .

No-show: Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has had to fork out £41,700 after he failed to turn up to two New Zealand charity fundraisers for a chronically ill school girl . Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has had to fork out £41,700 after he failed to turn up to two New Zealand charity fundraisers for a chronically ill schoolgirl. The 45-year-old missed a June 2010 event to raise cash for 11-year-old Matisse Reid, who needed an organ transplant because of a rare intestinal disorder, because his mother suffered a heart attack. He rescheduled to appear later that year, but again had to cancel because of 'business difficulties'. Auckland's Duco Events tried to sue him for £1million for his no-show at the sold-out functions, but they settled this week for £41,700. A spokesman for the firm said: 'The parties have reached a mutually-agreeable financial settlement, including a donation of NZ$100,000 (£51,500) to Matisse Reid and the trust Chance2Eat (the girl's charity).' It also said Duco and Ramsay had agreed to work together in 2013 on unspecified projects. The NZ$100,000 (£51,500) payment is reportedly the same as Ramsay's appearance fee for the charity events. Matisse, from Napier, has been receiving costly life-saving medical treatment in Pittsburgh, U.S. for the last five years. She underwent a transplant last year, but will still need further treatment. Her mother Jodee said the donation was 'generous, but unexpected'. TV star: Gordon Ramsay has become a household name in Britain, with several television shows and restaurants . Speaking from Pittsburgh, she told the New Zealand Herald: 'We just want it known that we are very grateful to Gordon Ramsay and David Higgins from Duco Events because this is a joint donation from both of them. 'Both of them had a lot of empathy for our situation and neither David nor Gordon really dragged us into the situation. 'They were very mindful of the situation we are dealing with is life and death and they are dealing with business stuff, so we would like it known that we are really grateful for them keeping us out of it and for their very generous donation.' She added: 'Matisse has not been cured, we are not sure whether she'll need another transplant in the future so the money will be set aside in case we would need it for her.' And she revealed that, despite having an intestinal condition that left her unable to eat for most of her life, Matisse had a love for food. The settlement of the court case comes as Ramsay makes a promotional tour to the country, with local media reporting how he faced a real kitchen nightmare. The Scottish-born cook almost lost his toes as a fan dropped a razor-sharp knife he wanted the chef to sign at an Auckland shop meet-and-greet, but then dropped it on the floor.

THESE shocking images of Louis Cole picking up his live pet goldfish and eating it have sparked an investigation by the RSPCA. The 28-year-old former youth worker is now being investigated for animal cruelty - which carries a maximum term of six months in jail - after posting the video online. In the YouTube video Mr Cole laughs as he looks into the camera, saying he is going to 'eat his pet goldfish'. Cruel: Louis Cole could be in hot water after eating his pet goldfish and putting a video of the stunt online . He then grabs the four-inch long fish from its bowl as it struggles to get free before putting it into his mouth and biting. During the video viewers even hear the crunch of the goldfish and see its tail flicking desperately from side to side. Mr Cole gags several times as he struggles to eat the fish, but after glugging from a glass of water and swallowing the remains of the creature. Pet: Louis Cole pulls the living goldfish from a bowl in front of a camera . He said: 'That was really, really bitter - the most bitter thing I've ever eaten.' More than 120,000 people have watched the video on YouTube after it was posted online a fortnight ago. The RSPCA has confirmed that it has now launched an investigation and that Mr Cole could face court if it decided to prosecute. Proud: He shows off the helpless fish and smiles in the YouTube video . Among the other videos posted online by Mr Cole - who prides himself of being to eat almost anything - include him eating a live tarantula, scorpion and crayfish. He is also shown blending 10 dead mice into a paste and downing the liquid, eating a Turkey leg infested with maggots and swallowing a dead duckling from its egg. The RSCA previously condemned Mr Cole's actions, but as all the animals he ate before the goldfish were invertebrates he was not breaking the law. Sickening: Louis Cole can be seen biting into his pet goldfish as its tail wiggles from his mouth . Disgust: Louis Cole can be seen gagging as he starts chewing his pet goldfish . Bitter: After finally clamping down his jaw and chewing the goldfish he said it was the bitterest thing he had ever eaten . A goldfish, however, is a vertebrate and the maximum sentence for cruelty to animals is a fine of £20,000 or six months in prison. The RSPCA said in a letter to Mr Cole that he is being investigated for causing unnecessary suffering to an animal under the Animal Welfare Act 2006. It said he was also being investigated for breaching the duty of a person responsible for an animal to ensure its welfare. Trouble: An RSPCA note warning he was in trouble was posted on Louis Cole's Facebook account . A letter was sent to Mr Cole, who lives in Roehampton, south west London, on Thursday. He then posted it on Facebook. It . said: 'The RSPCA need to interview you regarding an allegation that you . may have committed a criminal offence contrary to section 9 & 4 of . the Animal Welfare Act 2006. 'If . we cannot speak to you on a voluntary basis, you give us no other . choice than to request the police arrest you in order to interview you.

I do not hear from either you or your solicitor in the next few days I . will contact the local police who will attend your address to arrest . you.' Commenting on the letter on Facebook Mr Cole said he was in 'serious trouble' and asked friends to give him advice. Some . viewers who watched the video were disgusted at the at the demise of . the goldfish. One wrote: 'I've had to put this on mute; . to watch and cover my eyes also because I think I would be physically . sick if I heard any crunching. 'I . eat meat yes but things that are already dead not alive. So it makes me . feel slightly better about what I am eating and not as cruel - but this . vile.' Attention: Another video watched by 150,000 people on YouTube Louis Cole can be seen eating raw eyeballs . Speaking recently Mr Cole said he was not a 'cruel person', adding: 'I don't want to inflict any pain on these animals, which is why I try to kill them instantly.' He admitted, however, that lots of his friends think he's an attention grabber who enjoys 'riling people up a bit'.

A former sheriff's deputy kept his wife and a man he suspected of being her boyfriend captive for more than two hours, beating and sexually assaulting them because he was enraged over their affair, a prosecutor said today. The horrific details of the case were laid out in the prosecution's opening statement at the trial of Robert McClain, 38, who could receive a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted. The 12-year marriage of McClain and his wife was crumbling, and she became involved with a 23-year-old man for about four months, Orange County Deputy District Attorney John Christl told jurors. Insanity plea: Robert McClain is accused of beating, torturing and sexually assaulting his wife and her boyfriend when he found out about their affair . McClain eventually found out and persuaded his wife to let him meet his romantic rival — a musician who had moved to California to audition for American Idol. Authorities say the confrontation took place at a leasing office in Irvine where McClain's wife worked. A break room became a makeshift torture chamber, with McClain using two guns and a knife he had brought to the meeting, Christl said. McClain, a former Marine, repeatedly struck the man with his fists, asking him how many times he slept with his wife, then took a knife and slashed the victim's face, arm and groin, Christl said. Propping him up on a chair, McClain said: 'Are you glad you cheated with my wife, now?' At one point, McClain gave his wife a gun loaded with one bullet to kill the man, Christl said. On the fourth try, she fired, but no one was injured. 'He gave her an empty gun,' Christl said. McClain's defense attorney, Deputy Public Defender Darren Thompson, told the jury his client had no intention of hurting anyone but snapped when he saw his wife come to the aid of her lover. Thompson claimed his client's brain 'was on total shut down'. 'At some point he lost it,' Thompson said. 'He completely lost it.' The man was left inside the office. McClain's wife was badly beaten, and he eventually let her drive with her three children to the hospital, Christl said. The man was found hours later and had virtually every bone in his face broken, Christl said. He suffered brain damage and needed four months of rehabilitation to learn how to walk and talk. 'He couldn't remember what happened,' Christl said. 'He thought he was in a car accident.' If jurors find McClain guilty of crimes that include torture, kidnapping and sexual assault, the trial will enter a second phase when the jury must decide if he was legally sane on the night of September 28, 2008. McClain has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Wearing gray slacks, a striped shirt and a white skull cap, he looked at the graphic photos taken after the attacks but showed no response. Christl said investigators found bloodied clothing, a folding knife and guns that tied McClain to the crimes. McClain's wife was the first witness called by the prosecution and she recounted her marriage with her former husband, saying he was extremely jealous and she learned to walk with her head down so she wouldn't meet eyes with another man. 'He said that he took marriage very seriously,' she said as tears welled in her eyes. 'He said that if I ever cheated on him I would be nubbed away because he would cut all my limbs off.'","Former LA Deputy Robert McClain faces life in prison .

The pioneering pilot vanished without a trace over the South Pacific as she flew to the remote Howard Island. It is thought this photo taken by a military surveyor could show a piece of the landing gear from Earhart's plane. Mystery solved? This tiny dot could be part of the plane's landing gear sticking out of the water off the coast of Gardner Island in the Pacific . Close-up: This could be the landing gear from the doomed plane which disappeared in 1937 . Now a team are trying to prove that the aviator, then 39, survived a crash in 1937 and managed to make her way to dry land. It is thought that, unable to summon help in an era before satellite technology, she died some weeks later. Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan . disappeared on July 2, 1937, while travelling from Lae, in New Guinea, . to Howland Island during her bid to become the first woman to fly around . the world. The picture which could show a . landing gear from the aircraft was taken on Gardner Island, now known as . Nikumaroro Island, where a bundle of bones was found. Efforts to solve the riddle have been . given fresh impetus after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced . the government's support for a new $500,000 hunt to find her plane. But conspiracy theories, including . claims that they were U.S. government agents captured by the Japanese . before World War II, abound despite having been largely debunked. Enduring riddle: American avirator Amelia Earhart, posing by her plane in Long Beach, California, in 1930, disappeared while flying over the Pacific in 1937 . Wading in: U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (left) is offering her support to a private salvage team which is planning to search the location where Earhart if believed to have crashed . Intrigue: In her day, Earhart was extremely popular, but her mysterious death has kept that fame alive more than 75 years later . Conspiracy? There have been many theories behind what happened to Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan . Numerous attempts to find the . wreckage have failed. Last year, divers in Bougainville, Papua New . Guinea, said they were convinced they found the wreckage on Buka . Island, some 400 miles from Lae. But this new search focuses on Nikumaroro, which lies another 1,800 miles further east. One senior U.S. official said new . analysis of a contemporary photo of a portion of the island shows what . some people believe could be a strut and wheel of the plane protruding . from the water. Suspicions were also aroused when IGHAR found bone fragments thought to belong to Earhart on the island in 2010. Though tests to identify them proved inconclusive. The administration takes no position on the purported evidence and acknowledges there is fierce debate on the subject. An expedition, a joint public and . private venture, will depart for the islands on the 75th anniversary of Earhart's departure on the ill-fated trip. Previous visits to the island by the . group have recovered artifacts that could have belonged to Earhart and . Noonan and suggest they might have lived for days or weeks after landing . on a reef. The State Department and other U.S. government agencies supported Earhart and her goal. The State Department . obtained flight clearances from the countries in which she stopped and . coordinated the search effort with foreign governments. Salvage bid: This graphic shows the . journey Earhart had intended to make between Papua New Guinea and Howard . Island in 1937. The 'site of the plane wreck' at Buka Island shows where a doomed aircraft was found. It is now believed this is a red herring and not linked to Earhart's doomed journey. This latest search will focus on Nikumaroro island (far right), where bones . suspected of belonging to the aviator were found in 2010. It is also where the image which apparently shows a landing gear was found . Nikumaroro Island where finger bones were found in 2010 that were thought to belong to Amelia Earhart . The most widely accepted theory is that the aeroplane ran out of fuel and ditched in the sea. There have been several searches by many different professionals eager to solve the mystery, but none have been proven. Another popular theory is that they landed on the island of Nikumaroro in the Pheonix Islands, 350 miles southeast of Howland Island and fended for themselves for serveral months until they succumbed to injury or disease. Improvised tools and bits of Plexiglas that are consistent with that of an Electra window were found on the island. A few theorists reckon that she Earhart was spying on Japan and had been captured and executed. This theory has been discounted by the American authorities and press. A rumour claimed that she was one of many women sending messages on Tokyo Rose, an English-language Japanese propaganda station designed to attack the Allies' morale. An Australian aircraft engineer said he found a map that showed Earhart and Noonan may have turned round to try and refuel but crashed before getting to an airstrip. The most whacky theory is that she was still alive and had a different identity. A woman fron New Jersey successfully sued for $1.5m in damages from the author of a book who pursued this theory.","Photo taken by military surveyor on Pacific Island may show wreckage of doomed plane .

A 'pimp' has been accused of forcing young girls into prostitution and paying them with drugs and food from the McDonald's dollar menu. At least 12 young women were exploited by DaJuan Brown, of Cook County, Chicago, over a five-year period, a court heard. Brown - also known as 'Juan Clark' - regularly beat them, plied them with heroin and sometimes locked them up in his West Side apartment without any food or access to appliances, prosecutors claimed. If the girls met their 'quota' of clients, they would be 'rewarded' with more drugs or food from the McDonald's dollar menu, the court heard. However, it is alleged, if they failed to meet his demands he would punish them by withholding the drugs and forcing them to go through heroin withdrawal symptoms. Cook County prosecutors described how Brown - who also goes by the nickname of 'Church' - would control his victims' drug addictions. They said at least one girl who was clean of drugs became hooked on heroin after going to work for Brown, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Prosecutors said girls were touted through websites and Brown gave them pre-paid mobile phone for them to use while they were out - but the girls had to give back the Cricket handsets when they returned. The back door of the apartment where the girls were kept would be locked with a deadbolt while they were inside and Brown also had a man guarding the door, the court heard.

"By . Leon Watson . PUBLISHED: . 19:57 EST, 8 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:35 EST, 9 May 2012 . Peter Savva, 64, outside the Appeal Court. The chartered surveyor has been battling to block his teacher wife from divorcing him, claiming she is too mentally unstable . A husband who says his wife must be mad to divorce him has vowed to continue his legal campaign to block her finally ending their marriage. Chartered accountant, Peter Savva, 64, claims his wife of 34 years is too 'mentally unstable' to be permitted by the courts to break up their family. But Niki Savva, 58, a biology teacher at a north London sixth form college, is 'fed up' with his claims that she lacked the 'mental capacity' to instruct divorce solicitors. She filed for divorce last year and . was granted a decree nisi at Barnet County Court, bringing down the . curtain on her marriage to Mr Savva, which saw them raise two children. 'We are divorced as far as I'm concerned but he is not accepting it. He is in denial. I'm wary anything I say he could use against me,' Mrs Savva told the Evening Standard. She added: 'I have been told not to say anything because he will take it and twist it and turn it against me. 'He is trying to make things difficult for me at work. I am very happy that it is all over but not from his point of view.' Mr Savva, from Crouch End - who says . UK divorce laws do not do enough to encourage couples to stay together - . argued his wife took the decision to divorce him while she was 'angry' and in the midst of a 'breakdown'. And, despite failing to win the . backing of an Appeal Court judge for his fight to stay a married man, he . has vowed to continue his quest to have his wife assessed by a . psychiatrist and to prove that there is life left in their relationship. Also campaigning for reform of divorce . laws, he says there should be a 'cooling off period' to prevent . marriages being broken in the heat of the moment by 'angry' spouses. During the earlier divorce hearing, . Judge Markanza Cudby accepted Mrs Savva’s account that the marriage had . 'irretrievably broken down' and that the couple had slept in separate . bedrooms for the last eight years. Mr Savva, however, insisted he and . his wife had only been in separate rooms for two years 'because of the . house being in a bit of a state, her needing her own space and having a . lot of work documents'. He told the judge: 'I have not exhibited unreasonable behaviour... I accept my marriage has temporarily broken down, but it is not permanently broken down. 'My wife has suffered a breakdown... she must be ill otherwise she wouldn’t have said these things... she’s confused.' Mr Savva told the judge: 'I accept my marriage has temporarily broken down, but it is not permanently broken down.' Battling to have the decree nisi overturned before Lady Justice Black in the Appeal Court, Mr Savva told the judge: 'I’m doing my best to save my marriage.' 'Whilst my wife was angry and unhappy she issued divorce papers straight away...I consider that my wife lacks proper mental capacity to give instructions to her solicitors,' he went on. 'The demeanour and testimonies of the parties were treated as findings of fact in the absence of substantive evidence,' he said. He argued that, before allowing the divorce to go through, Judge Cudby needed hard evidence of his wife’s mental state 'from a disinterested party, not a petitioner who may be angry at her husband or may lack sufficient mental capacity to undertake divorce proceedings'. Mr Savva went on to call for changes in family law, saying that an abandoned rule, stipulating a one-year cooling off period to prevent marriages being ended in haste, ought to be reinstated. 'He considers that his wife has been unduly influenced by her solicitors, her mother and others.' Lady Justice Black . 'If that clause had not been removed... a lot of angry women would reconsider the future of their family and children before going on to consult solicitors,' he said. 'That is one of the reasons society is the way it is today. Uncorroborated and unsubstantiated, a decree nisi can be pronounced.' In her judgement, endorsed by Lady Justice Black, Judge Cudby had said: 'This is a very sad case in some ways. 'The husband really cannot accept that the marriage which has been in existence for a long time has broken down. 'It is always sad when one party says the marriage has ended and the other does not. In these circumstances there are no winners. 'He felt part of the reason why he feels his wife is mentally ill is because she wants to divorce him and could not understand why that would be. 'The husband finds all of this very difficult... he struggles to accept that his marriage has come to an end... he does not want to believe that the time has come when these parties must go their separate ways... he struggles and reaches out for any excuse other than the truth. 'The wife struck me as a lady who was upright, honest and, not unsurprisingly frankly, fed up with all that has been going on. 'She did not come across to me as in any way psychiatrically unwell or in need of any assistance.' Lady Justice Black said: 'He considers that his wife has been unduly influenced by her solicitors, her mother and others. 'He considers she is unwell and lacking in capacity and he can’t accept that she has brought this divorce petition for any reason other than that. 'The wife did not come across as in any way unwell or in need of psychiatric assistance. It was in fact the husband who was struggling to come to terms with the facts about the marriage. 'It was open to the judge to make the findings of fact she did about the husband’s behaviour and the wife’s mental state. 'The judge was entirely entitled to make the finding of irretrievable breakdown on the material before her. I therefore refuse the husband permission to appeal,' she concluded. Mr Savva, outside court, said that his legal battle would not end here and that he was seeking a judicial review of the laws governing the process of divorce, 'not for my own sake but for the sake of others'. 'Once the process of divorce starts it is very difficult to stop. It is a shame that the system will destroy a marriage for a silly reason. 'Irretrievable breakdown is very subjective. One judge in court on one day can make a decision which can relate to half of somebody's life and will cause irreparable damage to the parties. It affects society,' he added. He said Mrs Savva and their grown up children still have the former matrimonial home in Finchley. The financial side of the divorce has already been dealt with by consent, he added.","Peter Savva, 64, says wife Niki is 'mentally unstable'

The picture was the last taken of the three-year-old before she disappeared from her parents' apartment in Praia da . Luz five years ago. But today the emerged the poignant snap is being shown on a website boasting: '£20 off: Great discount on holiday bookings.' Madeleine McCann on the day she went missing from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal. This was the image reportedly used on a website selling holidays . The site sells breaks in a self-catering . family apartment in Albufeira, Algarve, just 25 miles from the resort where Madeleine vanished five years ago. The photo, on discount website VoucherDigg, was snapped hours before the youngster disappeared from the apartment. Madeleine's parents Kate, 44, and Gerry, 43, have been desperately searching for her since May 2007. Last night the couple's spokesman Clarence Mitchell branded its use 'appallingly insensitive'. Top London law firm Carter-Ruck has been called in to demand the removal of the picture with 'immediate effect'. Mr Mitchell told the Daily Star: 'This is an appalling use of Madeleine's picture and whether it is a result of hacking or a mistake it must be removed immediately. Treasured image: Madeline McCann's picture being used on holiday discount site VoucherDigg . The last picture of Madeleine before she was snatched is used with the caption: '£20 off - great discount on holiday bookings over £400...' 'Kate and Gerry are fully aware of this and are horrified. We understand it has been on the website for 24 hours.' Underneath her picture are the words 'best value''. When users click on it they are taken to a page featuring the same image and deals from lowcostholidays.com. The advert also urges holidaymakers: 'Hurry up for time is limited. Take the ones you loved and enjoy your life.'' VoucherDigg has not commented. Meanwhile, The Sun reported today that three new clues have emerged over a potential sighting of the child in Spain. A blonde girl fitting Madeleine's description was seen at a campsite on the Costa del Sol three days after she was snatched a few hours drive away in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May 3, 2007. A witness said the groggy-looking child seemed alienated from the German family she was staying with in a caravan. Now British police have been told the family paid extra for bringing one child more than expected when they arrived at the site on May 6. And questions over the number plates on their car have raised fears they could have been fakes used to dodge detection. Holidaymaker Karen Sisson, 49, who saw the child at the Cabopino campsite, near Fuengirola, said she got no response from cops when she raised the alarm at the time. Karen, of Gibraltar, told The Sun that the girl wore a pink T-shirt, shorts and a beige hat and seemed 'out of it'.","Site sells holiday to resort just 25 miles from where she went missing .

'Flashman': David Cameron, the Prime Minister, lost his cool with Ed Balls at Prime Minister's Questions today, calling the shadow chancellor an 'idiot' David Cameron dismissed Ed Balls as a 'muttering idiot' after losing his temper with the shadow chancellor during a heated exchange at Prime Minister's Questions today. The Prime Minister's unexpected outburst prompted a rebuke from Commons Speaker John Bercow, who told him to retract the slight as it was 'unparliamentary'. And Labour benches immediately leapt on Mr Cameron's loss of composure with cries of 'Flashman' - a reference to the bully in Tom Brown’s Schooldays. The taunt is a favourite amongst Labour MPs, who think Mr Cameron is at his weakest during PMQs when he is visibly riled and angry. Sources close to Mr Balls claimed it was the shadow chancellor’s demands for Mr Cameron to 'tell us about the recession' that tipped the Prime Minister over the edge. But according to MPs and political pundits on Twitter, Mr Balls sent the Prime Minister in to a spin by telling him to 'chillax, and have another glass of wine'. The jibe is a reference to a recently published book which claims Mr Cameron unwinds from the stresses of his job by drinking three or four glasses of wine with Sunday lunch. By the time it came to a Commons statement on the G8 and Nato summit in Chicago, Mr Cameron was in a conciliatory mood and volunteered an apology to Dennis Skinner, the veteran MP Labour, who he urged to retire during a heated Commons exchange last month. The barbed remark prompted accusations of 'ageism' against Mr Cameron. Today he admitted his remark was 'sharp' and insisted Mr Skinner was a 'tremendous ornament' in the Commons. To make matters worse for the PM, former chancellor Lord Lamont, to whom he was a special adviser when Britain crashed out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992, told the BBC’s World at One that Mr Cameron could be 'quite volatile'. Mr Cameron’s initial misdemeanour in PMQs was unexpected, he had only begun to answer a seemingly innocuous question on the Government’s economic record. Is David Cameron too 'chillaxed' to run the country? He said: 'What we need to do both in Britain and Europe is to combine deficit reduction, which has given us the low interest rates, with an active monetary policy, with structural reforms to make us competitive, and with innovative ways of using our hard-won credibility, which we wouldn’t have if we listened to the muttering idiot sitting opposite me.' After the Speaker's rebuke the PM replied that he would replace the word 'idiot' with the words 'the man who left us with this enormous deficit and this financial crisis'. Ed Balls, left, and Ed Miliband: Mr Cameron's outburst prompted cries of 'Flashman' from the Labour benches - a reference to the bully in Tom Brown's Schooldays - and a rebuke from Commons Speaker John Bercow . Speaking outside the Commons, a Labour source said: 'The Prime Minister is increasingly losing his temper and increasingly losing the House of Commons, because he is increasingly losing the economic argument. 'It is deeply un-prime ministerial and a sign of his weakness on the key economic argument.'","Shadow chancellor told him to 'chillax and have another glass of wine'

Leigh Turner, 54, told a jury that he did not read the note from his son Elliot to his mother Anita and he had ripped it up. He said that all he saw was 'Dear Mum' in his son’s handwriting and he had 'paranoid thoughts of what had happened' so he destroyed it. On trial: Elliot Turner is charged with the murder of girlfriend Emily Longley . Accused: Leigh Turner, 53, and his wife Anita are charged with obstructing the course of justice . He and his wife Anita, 51, both deny perverting the course of justice. Elliot Turner, 20, denies the murder . of aspiring model Emily Longley, 17, in his bedroom at the family home . in Bournemouth, Dorset. The prosecution at Winchester Crown . Court allege that Turner 'went absolutely nuts' and strangled the . teenager in a jealous rage on May 7 last year after he feared she was . seeing other men. He had threatened to kill her and had assaulted her when they argued during the short volatile relationship. He said she attacked him and he . grabbed her by the throat for five or six seconds to defend himself and . had gone to bed and woke up to find her dead. Today Elliot Turner pleaded guilty to . the charge of perverting the course of justice by persuading his mother . to change her story after the count was amended to take away reference . to the fact he failed to call an ambulance.

'I just thought the worse.. I didn’t . know what it was. It might have said Elliot might have had some . involvement, or something written down that might have happened that . night. 'I cannot think what I thought - it was an entity, a void. I felt numb.' He later said he had learnt a little . of what was in the note when he overheard his wife and son talking about . a mallet, an argument and being hit.

Royal Mail came under fire last night for using the Olympics as an excuse to impose a £1 ‘tax’ on parcels. It will raise prices and cut delivery targets during the six-week Games period because of the expected traffic chaos. It means anyone using Royal Mail’s Parcelforce arm to post a parcel to much of London will have to pay an extra pound.deliveries could be delayed by an extra day because of the disruption caused by the Olympics. Postal deliveries will be disrupted by the Games this summer . In addition, customers have been warned that any letter or parcel posted from the start of the Olympics on July 27 until the final day of the Paralympics on September 9 could take at least one extra day to arrive. Royal Mail will also scrap the pledge for Special Delivery items to arrive by 9am or before 1pm next day, downgrading the guarantee to ‘the next day’.Yesterday’s announcement – immediately described as a ‘tax on business’ – affects items sent to any of London’s eight main postcodes. These are E, EC, N, NW, SE, SW, W and WC, covering around two million homes and businesses. Anybody outside London who needs to send post to one of these areas is being told to send it a day earlier than usual. Within London, it should go ‘earlier in the day than usual’. The Royal Mail’s normal pledge is that a first-class letter will arrive the next working day, and a second-class one within three working days. Parcelforce’s £1 charge will replace the 50p surcharge which is already levied on parcels sent to postcodes in central London affected by the capital’s congestion charge. The announcement comes weeks after Royal Mail hit its customers with inflation-busting increases in stamp prices. A first-class stamp, which used to be 46p, now costs 60p. A 36p second-class stamp has jumped to 50p. Major delays are expected on London's transport routes - commuters are advised not to travel by tube . Yesterday’s statement from Royal Mail points out that its rivals, such as UPS, are also levying extra charges during the Olympics period, with many charging far more than Royal Mail’s extra fee. But Phil McCabe, from the Forum of Private Business, said: ‘Whilst I can understand that there may be disruption as a result of the Olympics, charging considerably more for a poorer service is an equation that does not add up. ‘Many of our members rely on Royal Mail’s postal service, and will struggle as a result of yet another price rise when the service is being cut.’ Tory MP Brian Binley, who sits on the Business and Innovation Select Committee which oversees the Royal Mail, said the fee was ‘a tax on business’ and ‘a blackmailing surcharge’. Mark Thomson, Olympic director for Royal Mail, said: ‘We will continue to collect and deliver six days a week despite the inevitable impact on the capital’s transport system.’ Robert Hammond of Consumer Focus said: ‘We recognise that hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games will throw up logistical challenges for many organisations. ‘We’re satisfied that Royal Mail is planning ahead as much as it can, and aims to keep customer disruption to a minimum. ‘We would ask customers in London to bear with Royal Mail if their post arrives a little later during the Olympics.’ Expect traffic jam 'chaos' on the first three days of the Games . Unlike many other workers, Royal Mail staff will not receive an ‘Olympic bonus’, the company said last night. They will be paid overtime, worth up to 1.65 times the normal £11.97 hourly rate for a postman in inner London, according to figures from the Communication Workers’ Union. Parcelforce is having to spend more than £1million, employ an extra 260 staff and hire 140 vehicles to keep packages moving during the Olympics.","Postmen and women will start their delivery routes earlier because of extra travelling times .

A rural campaigner was arrested and held by police for five hours after he put up a poster protesting plans to build a supermarket in a market town. Ralph Rea, 64, affixed the poster - which featured the crossed-out faces of four former councillors below an 'Un-wanted' sign - to a noticeboard in Cardigan, mid-Wales. He was arrested on suspicion of harassment after the former councillors, who had supported plans to build a Sainsbury's supermarket in the picturesque town, complained to police. Outspoken: Ralph Rea was arrested and held by police for five hours after he put up a poster protesting plans to build a supermarket in a market town . Mr Rea has been outspoken in a long-running campaign against the plan. He said: 'I have openly admitted putting up a small poster on a public notice board, as I have a perfect right to do.' He said his arrest was a 'suppression of free speech' and added he felt 'victimised'. He added: 'This is a massive overreaction.' The poster, which was posted all over the town in the run-up to May's local government elections, was considered offensive and tantamount to harassment by some deposed town councillors. Mr Rea has been a spokesman for the No To Bath House Project Campaign since the scheme to build a Sainsbury's store was given the green light two years ago. He was arrested by police and held for five hours on May 11 following complaints over the poster, which Mr Rea attached to the notice board in the town's Finch Square. 'Suppression of free speech': Mr Rea was arrested on suspicion of harassment placing the poster on a noticeboard in the Welsh town of Cardigan (pictured) The poster, which Mr Rea said he did not produce, carries pictures of former Cardigan town councillors David Grace, Linda Grace, Mair Morris and Alan Wilson with their faces crossed out below an 'Un-wanted' sign. The poster accuses the quartet of 'gross-negligence and betrayal' in supporting the Bath House plans against the wishes of nearly 3,000 people who signed a petition opposing the move. While Mair Morris and Alan Wilson stood down ahead of May's elections, David and Linda Grace, a three-time mayor, were both ousted from their seats on the council after 17 years. The poster campaign may have played a part in their defeats at the polls. Mr Rea said that the poster, which was also mailed to every household and business in Cardigan, is 'obviously not offensive' and added he did not know who produced it. David and Linda Grace said they were 'unable to make any comment as it is an ongoing police investigation'. A Dyfed-Powys Police spokesman said: 'Dyfed-Powys police arrested a 64-year-old man from the Cardigan area on 11 May on suspicion of harassment, and bailed pending further enquiries.'

An actor who rubbed shoulders with Hollywood A-listers at Cannes last month is back to his day job - working as a £16,000-per-year binman. Gary Maitland, 28, stars in Ken Loach's new film The Angel's Share which scooped the Jury Prize at the festival. But the film star has yet to land a full-time acting role so is back to loading rubbish onto the back of a lorry in Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire, Scotland. Scroll down for video . Film star: Gary in Cannes (left) with his co-stars (l to r) William Ruane, Siobhan Reilly, Ewan MacGregor, Jasmine Riggs and Paul Brannigan . A movie star? Rubbish! Binman Gary Maitland, 28, who has appeared in three hit movies over the last decade while working collecting the rubbish in South Lanarkshire . The actor has appeared in two of Ken Loach's earlier movies - Sweet Sixteen in 2002 and Tickets in 2005. Gary, who has been working as a binman for the last 10 years, said he had no intention of giving up his job despite flying off to promote the film with Mr Loach next month. He works from 7.30am to 3.30pm cleaning the streets of South Lanarkshire. Speaking from the South Lanarkshire Council bin depot in Rutherglen, Scotland, Gary said: 'We are all mates here, I come in at 7.30am and I have my bit to do like anyone else - being in a movie doesn’t change that. 'But I am on the look-out for an agent. I have a couple of calls in and I’m waiting for a response and obviously if the right part came up I would do it, it’s a no-brainer.

'But for the time being I’m happy doing what I’m doing. I’ve been here 10 years, it’s part of my life.' Gary first hit the big screen in 2002 when he appeared in the Ken Loach movie Sweet Sixteen. Acting chance: Ken Loach got in touch with Gary Maitland and offered him a role in his new film seven years after his last movie role . He got a second chance to appear on film in another one of the director's films called Tickets in 2005. He got another chance to star in a . film when he received a message from Ken Loach's casting director . Kahleen Crawford on Facebook. Gary . added: 'One night I was on Facebook and I got this message out the blue . asking if I was the same Gary Maitland that has appeared in Sweet . Sixteen and Tickets. 'I replied ""in the flesh"", and gave her my new mobile number which had been changed since I last worked with Ken. 'I was really surprised because it had been a few years since Tickets and I just wasn’t expecting it. 'It kind of spiralled from there. She told me Ken was in Glasgow so I went to meet him in the city centre. I did a couple of auditions and I got the part, I had no idea it would be such a big role, I assumed it was just a wee one. 'I keep seeing my face on the poster on the side of buses while I’m out working. It’s a lot of fun.' The Angel’s Share follows Robbie, played by Glasgow-born actor Paul Brannigan, a desperate father who tries to turn his life round with a whisky heist. The film, which won the prestigious Jury Prize at Cannes, was shot on location in Glasgow. Gary, who plays goofy character ‘Albert’, said he is still in contact with Mr Loach and the movie’s cast, teacher Siobhan Reilly, actress Jasmin Riggins, established star John Henshaw and Glasgow-born newcomer Paul Brannigan. The film had its Scottish premier at Cineworld, in Renfrew Street, Glasgow, last month and has had good reviews around Britain. Gary said he hopes to be featured in any upcoming Ken Loach movies. The part-time actor, who is single, added: 'I get a bit of banter from the lads but nothing as changed. 'People come up to me in the pub sometimes but my life hasn’t changed very much. 'I am open for anything really. My bosses have been really great letting me take unpaid leave for seven weeks during filming and letting me take holiday for the promotional tour next month. 'It would be great to work with Ken again. He obviously likes something about me and I know the way he works.

'I’ve always been into drama and did it for my Highers so to be a full-time actor would be a dream for me.' Gary’s fellow binman Kevin Kennedy, 31, a father-of-three, from Hamilton, said: 'I went to see it with the missus. It was strange seeing Gary on the big screen as I work with him.

An honour student forced to spend a night in jail for missing too much school has received international support, and a Louisiana-based group has raised more than $91,000 for the teen. Diane Tran, a junior at Willis High School near Houston was ordered by a Texas judge to spend 24 hours behind bars and pay a $100 fine for her excessive truancy because she was forced to work two jobs to support her siblings. The 17-year-old has received international support from people in 49 states and 15 countries as people have chipped in to help the student make ends meet. Scroll down for videos . Devastated: Diane Tran, 17, has a criminal record and spent a night in jail after being charged with truancy. She works two jobs to support her family . Abandoned: Her parents divorced 'out of the blue' and left Tran and her two siblings to fend for themselves . Ms Tran, who works part time for a wedding planner and full-time for a dry-cleaners, also manages to squeeze in a full course load. She told KHOU 11 News that she missed around three days of school every month because of sheer exhaustion. Louisiana Children’s Education Alliance has been one such organisation to help out Ms Tran, helping her raise more than $91,000 on HelpDianeTran.com. LCEA president Charlie Davis told Fox News that the story of Ms Tran is just one example of a ‘student who’s obviously working so hard and is being taken advantage of by the system.’ He continued: ‘I think Diane unfortunately is at the centre of two failed systems in America – our public education system and our judicial system.’ Mr Davis said he hopes the 17-year-old student puts the money to supporting her brother and sister, and her college education. Since her story spread around the world, the Texas teenager told KHOU that she’s fixing all of her attention on finals, and will grant more interviews once the school year is over. Meanwhile, the judge presiding over the case, Judge Lanny Moriarty said that he was offering no comment on the case. LCEA is petitioning Judge Moriarty to cancel the fine and the jail sentencing so her future ambitions - including college applications - won't be marred. Offering help: Louisiana Children's Education Alliance president Charlie Davis has helped raise more than $91,000 for Ms Tran . Assistance: He created HelpDianeTran.com, where people can donate and sign a petition for the judge to cancel the fine and her sentencing . According to Texas state law, Ms Tran violated the state’s truancy laws, which do not allow more than 10 days of absences within a six-month period. Ms Tran said she works a full time job, a part-time job, and takes advancement and dual credit college level courses at Willis High School. '[I take] dual credit U.S. history, dual credit English literacy, college algebra, Spanish language AP,' she said of her impressive academic workload. However, the high-achiever cannot devote as much time as she would like to her schooling as she often misses an entire day, reported KHOU. Ms Tran said that her parents divorced 'out of the blue,' leaving her and her two siblings to fend for themselves. And so, it fell to Ms Tran to support her siblings, who include an older brother at Texas A&M University and a younger sister who lives with relatives. Harsh: Judge Lanny Moriarty also ordered Tran to pay a $100 fine but others are asking that he shows leniency on the school girl . Honour student: Tran works a full time job, a part-time job and takes advancement and dual credit college level courses at Willis High School near Houston, Texas . Local authorities are using Ms Tran's case to crackdown on truancy. At the sentencing, Judge Moriarty ordered the exhausted student to pay a $100 fine and spend 24 hours in jail as a lesson. According to Texas state law, students who are absent from school without parental consent for three days in a four-week period or ten or more days in a six-month period are subject to prosecution. The exact punishment for offenders is left for the judge to decide. Parents of children who miss excessive amounts of school may also be prosecuted. The strict law is in place to keep students in school and learning. 'If you let one [truant student] run loose, what are you gonna' do with the rest of 'em? Let them go too?' he said. He had warned her last month to stop missing her classes. Ms Tran's employer at the Waverly Manor wedding venue, where she works over the weekends, suggested that the authorities should 'help [the family], don't harm them'. Ms Tran also works full-time at a dry cleaners. Her co-worker and classmate Devin Hill told the network how hard her friend works. 'She goes from job to job, from school, she stays up 'til 7 o'clock in the morning to study' she said. On the homepage of the school's website, there is a warning to students to be vigilant about their attendance. 'Should a student have multiple unexcused absences and a pattern of failing to attend school regularly, the law is clear that the matter becomes the jurisdiction of the court system,' it states. However, locals are arguing that Ms Tran's case is unique and should be treated with more leniency. Ms Tran, in the meantime, is worried this could mar her future ambitions - she one day hopes to become a doctor.

Barak Obama secretly stepped up a viral war on Iran's nuclear programme, but the technology escaped leaving the U.S. government exposed . Barack Obama secretly stepped up a viral war on Iran’s nuclear programme by creating a virus that has now escaped into the rest of the internet. Obama accelerated the attacks which began under the previous Bush administration and were code-named Olympic Games. One of the computer viruses, Stuxnet, accidentally became public in the summer of 2010 after getting out of Iran’s Natanz nuclear plant. The error sent the damaging programme, reportedly developed by the U.S. and Israeli governments, around the world on the internet. Computer security experts began studying the government developed worm and named it Stuxnet. After the 'escape' Obama and senior White House officials urgently met to discuss if their high tech attempt to slow the progress of Iran’s nuclear efforts had been fatally compromised. Not only did it pose a threat to computers outside Iran, it also undermined Obama's political attacks on other old enemies, such as China, for launching cyber-raids on the US. 'Should we shut this thing down?' he asked two years ago, according accounts given to the New York Times by members of the president’s national security team. But the U.S. decided the cyber-attacks should continue and in the following weeks, the Iranian Natanz plant was hit by a newer version of the computer worm, and then another after that. The last of that series of attacks took place a few weeks after Stuxnet was detected around the world, according the New York Times. The worm was designed to break the Iranian nuclear centrifuge equipment by issuing commands to the hardware responsible for their spin rate. Ambition: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visiting the Natanz uranium enrichment facilities south capital Tehran in 2008 before it came under a series of cyber attacks . Both Governments hoped to set back Iran's research programme and the U.S. also hoped to keep Israel from launching a pre-emptive military attack. The code was only supposed to work within Iran's Natanz refining facility, which was protected from outside networks and hard to penetrate, according to the Ars Technica website. Computers and memory cards could be carried between the public internet and the private Natanz network offering a way in for the cyber attack. The Stuxnet virus that damaged Iran's nuclear program was likely one of at least five cyber weapons developed on a single platform . A preliminary bit of code was used to map out all the network connections within the plant and report them back to the U.S. That program, first authorized by George W. Bush, provided a digital map of Natanz and its industrial control hardware. U.S. labs then began testing different bits of the plan to sabotage Natanz using similar centrifuges that had come from Libya. When the coders found the right sets of commands to literally shake the centrifuges apart, they knew that Stuxnet could work. When Obama came to office, he continued the program which had disabled bits of the Natanz plant even while telling controllers everything was normal. But in 2010, Stuxnet escaped, probably on someone's laptop according to Ars Technica and did what it was designed not to do - spread in public. 'We think there was a modification done by the Israelis,' one of the briefers told the president, 'and we don’t know if we were part of that activity.' Obama, according to officials in the room, asked a series of questions, fearful that the code could do damage outside the plant, but the answer about its potential impact was unclear. The government also feared Stuxnet's escape would damage US credibility when it complained about such attacks launched by other nations. Obama was at least aware of the issue, but pressed ahead, even accelerating the Olympic Games program. One of his aides said: '[Obama] repeatedly expressed concerns that any American acknowledgment that it was using cyber-weapons - even under the most careful and limited circumstances - could enable other countries, terrorists or hackers to justify their own attacks,' 'We discussed the irony, more than once.' In May the British military's head of cyber security Major General Jonathan Shaw said the Ministry of Defence has been attacked by hackers . In November  Foreign Secretary William Hague warned countries like China and Russia to cease hostile cyber attacks on other states . In 2010 Google complained about major attacks on its website by Chinese hackers and suggested the Chinese government may have instigated them . Five years ago cyber-attacks almost crippled the banking system of Estonia with the culprits thought to be Russian criminals or even the Russian government . Since then the cyber-war seems to have continued, with last month computer technicians at Iran's Oil Ministry cutting off its internet links as the battled a complex virus. At the time, Iranian officials described it as a data-siphoning blitz on key oil networks. Experts this week named the program Flame and say it can secretly take and transfer computer files and even listen in on the computer's user. Its origins remain a mystery, but international suspicion quickly fell on Israel opening another front in its suspected covert wars with Tehran. Gholam Reza Jalali, who heads an Iranian military unit in charge of fighting sabotage, said: 'This virus penetrated some fields. One of them was the oil sector. 'Fortunately, we detected and controlled this single incident.' Israeli's vice premier on Tuesday did little to deflect suspicion about the country's possible involvement. Moshe Yaalon told Army Radio: 'Whoever sees the Iranian threat as a significant threat is likely to take various steps, including these, to hobble it. 'Israel is blessed with high technology, and we boast tools that open all sorts of opportunities for us.'","Details of U.S. presidents backing for high tech attacks on Iran confirmed by security team source .

Referendum: Lord Owen says the deepening eurozone crisis means that Britons should be asked urgently whether the UK is better off out of the EU . Britain has the perfect opportunity to break from the 'shackles' imposed by Brussels as members like Germany close ranks to form a 'single country called Europe', Former Labour Foreign Secretary Lord Owen has said. And to ensure Britain looks after itself, the electorate must be asked two simple questions, would the UK be better off leaving the EU, or staying and joining the euro, he said. As the eurozone faces its biggest ever crisis, he said now is the perfect time to act decisively over the UK's future in Europe. 'A referendum on the future of Europe is inevitable at some point between 2013 and 2016 at the latest,' he wrote in The Times. It came as Chancellor George Osborne again resisted calls for a snap in-out referendum. Today Britain's Foreign Secretary from 1977-79 said the UK would be better off cutting links with Brussels to join a wider single market to include non-EU members like Turkey and Iceland, which he calls the 'European Community'. This, he told The Times, has to happen . because Britain's vision for an EU of no further integration and . Germany's wish for near-complete integration are incompatible. Lord Owen, who is the most senior British political figure to back a referendum so far, believes Eurozone members are squeezing together to form a group that is 'to all intents and purposes, though not in name, a single government.' Posing for the cameras: Prime Minister David Cameron poses with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg on the roof terrace of the Kanzleramt in Berlin . Stage-managed stroll: The trio of Jens Stoltenberg, Angela Merkel and David Cameron come over all Reservoir Dogs on the roof of the Kanzeleramt . 'In the UK, but also in some other countries, there are growing public demands for a consistent position to resist any further merging of the two models,  because the people in these countries to remain self-governing, in that they are determined to retain their own currency and remain in control of their own foreign, defence and fiscal policies,' he said. 'Yet these same countries see the argument for greater integration within the eurozone to help resolve the continued crisis. The way these issues can be resolved Europe-wide is to enable those countries who wish to integrate further to do so and allow those countries who do not ever envisage becoming part of the eurozone to remain in a restructured single market.' Key areas that have been handed over to Brussels in the past, like agriculture and fishing as well as foreign, security and defence policy, would go straight back to Westminster, he said . Reforms: Privately George Osborne is said to be pro-referendum but today he refused to be drawn on an urgent vote as the eurozone reshapes itself to survive . Lord Owen makes these warnings in his new book, 'Europe Restructured', which says David Cameron and Ed Miliband will have to promise one between now and 2016. Chancellor George Osborne, who is also David Cameron's campaign adviser, is said privately to be backing a referendum as a huge proportion of Tory members want it written into their 2015 general election manifesto. But speaking this morning he resisted Lord Owen's calls saying that a vote would only be triggered if British sovereignty was threatened and the question would be based on an individual treaty, not a straight in-out poll. 'The British people would be concerned if there was any transfer of power, ' he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. 'A reshaped relationship with Europe would involve a transfer of sovereignty or powers to Brussels. I think we have a very clear safeguard in the system now, thanks to this Government, which is, if there is any transfer of power from this country, transfer of competence or transfer of sovereignty from this country to the European Union then there will be a referendum. 'That is not something that happened at the time of the Lisbon treaty and the constitution, that’s not something that happened at the time of the Maastricht treaty. 'We have now put right that, ensuring in law there is this referendum lock, and as I say, people did not really notice the passage of this law about a year ago, but I think it’s one of the most significant things this Government has done.' Tory Andrea Leadsom, co-chair of the Fresh Start group of MPs, said the euro crisis was a 'perfect opportunity' to renegotiate Britain’s position in the EU. 'This isn’t about profiting from the eurozone’s hardship - it’s about facing up to the reality of the damage the EU is doing to our economy and our civil society and showing the single-mindedness to do something about it,' she wrote in the Daily Telegraph. Her plan would involve the 'nuclear option' of defying EU rules if it was in the interests of the UK. Tory Douglas Carswell will attempt to use a private member’s bill to repeal the legislation which led to the UK joining the European Union. He said: 'Getting Britain out of the EU is legally straightforward. Economically, it is increasingly desirable. 'Politically, it is no longer easy to dismiss as pie-in-the-sky.' Meanwhile with the eurozone in meltdown David Cameron will tell German leader . today Angela Merkel to put her country's full weight behind an ‘immediate’ rescue plan for . the euro or start planning for the break-up of the single currency. 'Shackles': Britain has the chance to break from Brussels, Lord Owen says, and take back many of its policy decisions in the process . The . Prime Minister is due in Berlin for crisis talks with the German . chancellor as fears grow about the debt crisis engulfing the eurozone because Spain is edging closer to a £100billion bailout of its banks  and is running out of money. Mr Osborne said today the decision on whether to use bailout funds to bailout Spanish banks would not involve British taxpayers' money. 'First of all it’s eurozone money, and the reason that’s important for me and for this country is that it is not British taxpayers’ money, and as a result I think we have to respect the fact the eurozone need to make their own decisions about how exactly they get money into the Spanish banks, and the conditions they attach to that. 'Spain need to restructure their banking system, they need the resources to do that, and how exactly that is done, as I say, must be a matter for the Spanish government and the eurozone.'","Lord Owen says Germany is racing towards 'a single European government in all but name'
Therefore Britons must be asked: 'Will the UK be better off leaving the EU or staying and joining the euro?', he says .
Britain could leave for a larger 'European Community', he says .

But there was nothing noble about the scenes that unfolded when Premier League footballer Danny Guthrie chose the venue for his wedding. As the champagne flowed, the celebration descended into a chaotic, drunken brawl between the families of the bride and groom. One source revealed things got out of hand when guests began ‘chucking the lobster thermidor about’. Bride and Toon: Danny Guthrie playing for Newcastle (left) and with his new bride during the first dance at their wedding (right). The night ended in a mass brawl . Guthrie, his bride Rebecca, their fathers and siblings were all said to have been caught up in the violence which involved punches, slaps and kicks. Among them were the star’s sisters Madonna, 23, and Tanita, 21, and the bride’s sister Charlotte, 16. Guthrie’s father Sean and Rebecca’s father Roy Middleman were also allegedly involved in the fracas. Reports of the mayhem suggested Roy ended up on the floor and Rebecca, 23, was punched. Police were twice called out to the 18th century mansion near Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, in the early hours. Officers arrived at 2.25am following a 999 call from worried staff watching ‘a fight among a group of guests’. No arrests were made as the party was breaking up by the time police turned up. But they were called back two hours later after Guthrie, 25, allegedly damaged a door to gain entry into the castle, where he was supposed to be spending the night in the bridal suite. Later police received a report of a ‘disturbance’ that took place on a bus taking guests away from the reception. Midfielder Guthrie is out of contract with Newcastle United and reports of the violence will not help his search for a deal with another club. Allerton Castle in Yorkshire, where police were twice called last weekend, is a popular wedding venue . A wedding in the great hall at Allerton Castle, where Danny and Rebecca Guthrie were married on Friday 1 June . The lavish wedding on Friday June 1 cost up to £40,000. After a 4pm ceremony in the ornate surroundings of the castle’s oak panelled Grand Hall, there were photographs and drinks before guests retired to a marquee for the reception. The castle – once home to the Grand Old Duke of York – was devastated by a fire seven years ago as wealthy American owner Dr Gerald Rolph was nearing the end of an £8million project to restore it to its former glory. A further £5million was spent on repairing the damage. A source said staff were relieved the wedding guests were outside the castle when the trouble began. But they were ‘shocked and disgusted’ by the behaviour of members of the groom’s family, from Telford in Shropshire, and the bride’s side, who come from Liverpool. ‘To say they behaved like peasants with money is an understatement,’ said the source. ‘They were obnoxious and disgusting. One could say it would be expected of a rough pub on a council estate, but then that’s probably unfair to council estates. It was more Big Fat Gypsy Wedding than our usual clientele.’ Guests reportedly threw lobster thermidor at the lakeside reception following the footballer's wedding . Staff at the £40,000 wedding last weekend said 'It was more Big Fat Gypsy Wedding than our usual clientele' At one point, candelabra had to be removed from tables amid fears of a fire being started. The castle has a bridal suite and three en-suite rooms for immediate family. Other guests stay at hotels nearby. It was locked at 3.30am by managers John and Jan Cook, who live on the site. The couple were woken at around 4am by the sound of someone breaking in and allegedly found the groom had damaged the door. Police were called again but the families were allowed to spend the rest of the night in the bedrooms without further incident. Mr and Mrs Cook and the catering company Dine have refused to comment. A North Yorkshire Police spokesman confirmed they were called out twice although ‘no arrests were made’. Speaking from the £800,000 home in Ponteland, Tyneside, she shares with her husband, Rebecca Guthrie appeared to deny any trouble. She said: ‘No, no, no. I don’t want to know, this is way beyond me, I don’t want this, this didn’t happen.’ Guthrie meanwhile tweeted: ‘Its been made to look a whole lot worse. Gossip gossip gossip.’","£40,000 wedding of Danny Guthrie descended into violence last weekend .

More than a million patients will face disruption because of the first doctors’ strike in nearly 40 years next week. Members of the British Medical Association will refuse to treat patients for 24 hours unless their condition is life-threatening or urgent. But Thursday’s day of action over changes to doctors’ pensions has already led to the cancellation of tens of thousands of cataract  operations, hip and knee replacements and many more routine tests and scans. A first in 40 years: Members of the British Medical Association will strike over changes to doctors' pensions . Protecting pay: The pensions reform will mean doctors have to contribute more and retire later . In addition, 1.25million GP appointments will also be postponed – including 400,000 involving the elderly and 140,000 for children. Last night there were fears that the strike would immediately create a huge backlog that will have knock-on effects for the NHS for several weeks. Patients whose operations, hospital tests or scans were due to take place on Thursday have been sent cancellation letters but many have still to be given a new appointment date. Last night the Department of Health warned this could take some time. Other victims of the dispute include 1,350 waiting for cataract surgery and 700 awaiting hip and knee replacements. Another 7,500 with heart problems have had appointments cancelled and a further 7,500 paediatric appointments will be postponed . Around 9,500 pregnant women have had tests and scans cancelled and 200,000 hospital outpatient appointments will need to be rescheduled. Accident and Emergency wards will remain open, however, and doctors have pledged to treat anyone with an urgent complaint. But Roger Goss, of pressure group Patient Concern, said: ‘It is absolute nonsense for the BMA to claim that the interests of their patients are paramount. Condemned: The strike on June 21 - the first industrial action by the profession in almost 40 years - has been widely criticised by politicians and the public . Still open: Accident and emergency departments will remain open and doctors have promised to treat anyone with an urgent complaint . ‘Frankly the industrial action is an outrage. The doctors in this country are among the best paid, with the most generous pensions in the world.’ Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association, has warned that the strike is a ‘huge risk’ because of the difficulty of working out who needs treatment and who can wait. Working overtime: Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has urged doctors to work at the weekend to clear the backlog caused by the strike . Dean Royles, director of the NHS Employers organisation, said he was ‘very worried’ about the protest. He added: ‘Doctors know any industrial action will impact on care and cause distress and disruption to patients and undermine trust in the medical profession.’ Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has told those GPs planning to strike to consider working the following Saturday to clear the backlog of appointments. In a letter to the BMA’s head Hamish Meldrum, he says they must ensure patients are seen quickly as ‘today’s routine appointments could become tomorrow’s emergencies’. But because GPs are self-employed – and Mr Lansley isn’t technically their boss – they are unlikely to agree to make up the lost time in this way. Most GPs have not done a weekend shift since 2004 when a deal brought in by Labour enabled them to opt-out of out-of-hours work. Responding to the letter, Dr Meldrum told Mr Lansley that the decision to take action ‘was not taken lightly’. It remains unclear how many of the 150,000 doctors in England and Wales will take part in Thursday’s protest and many have admitted they are deeply opposed. But the BMA is angry that reforms to their pensions will mean doctors have to contribute more and retire later. At present, a consultant earning £120,000 can expect to retire at 60 on an annual pension of £48,000, with a £140,000 lump sum. The decision to stage industrial action followed a ballot involving 52,000 members, of whom the majority voted in favour. But another 52,000 members didn’t return their voting slips and at least 50,000 other doctors do not belong to the BMA.","British Medical Association (BMA) members striking on Thursday over changes to doctors' pensions .

A girl of 15 died of tuberculosis after GPs told her family to send her to a spiritual healer because she was ‘lovesick for a boy’. Despite crippling illness which left Alina Sarag painfully thin and unable to walk, doctors repeatedly sent her home, telling her desperate family that her illness was in her mind or at most a stomach bug. As a coroner yesterday slammed the doctors for ‘gross failures’ which contributed to her death, it emerged Alina made nine visits to her GPs’ surgery, three visits to a community health centre, and attended three different hospitals on four occasions in the months before she died. Neglected: Tragic Alina Sarag died after her GP Dr Sharad Shripadrao Pandit failed to diagnose her with tuberculosis . Each time, doctors failed to test for tuberculosis, even though she had contracted the disease once before. This neglect contributed to her death, . coroner Aidan Cotter said, and it was ‘likely’ she could have been . saved if simple tests had been carried out. Her distraught family, who . say their pleas for help were repeatedly ignored by ‘atrocious’ doctors, . plan to sue the NHS. Alina, from Sparkbrook, Birmingham, . was first diagnosed with TB in 2009 after a girl at her school . contracted the illness. She was prescribed a course of antibiotics and . believed it had cleared before being struck down again in July 2010 . after returning from a trip to Pakistan. Distraught: The schoolgirl's parents turned up for the verdict at Sutton Town Hall to hear the coroner return a verdict of death by natural causes . Alina, aged seven (left) and 15. She was described as normally 'outgoing and bubbly' until she is believed to have contracted TB . Sulton Sarag and Farhat Mahmooda, the parents of Alina Sarag, sought help from multiple key healthcare providers across Birmingham and no one was able to diagnose their daughter . TB is at its highest level in the UK for more than 30 years, with 9,000 new cases last year alone, up five per cent from 2010. Most people believe the disease was wiped out by antibiotics in the Fifties but it never totally went away and cases started increasing from the early Eighties. Mike Mandlebaum, chief executive of the charity TB Alert, said: 'TB is a disease usually associated with certain high-risk groups such as . those with HIV, those from Eastern bloc countries and Asia, and those . living in crowded living conditions. But anyone can get it.' London has the highest infection rate in Britain. The disease is often brought into the . country by visitors from India, South-East Asia and Africa, and it is . also common amongst the homeless and drug users. Last month the UK Government said foreign travellers entering the UK from . countries with high incidence of tuberculosis will have to go through a . screening for the disease before being granted a visa. The disease is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria and differs according to where the infection takes hold. Most TB affects the lungs but around 40 per cent of cases involve disease elsewhere. It is spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes and the bacteria is breathed in by someone close by. Some people who are infected never develop symptoms - although the bacteria remain in the body, they are not infectious. This is known as latent TB and can develop into the active form of . the disease years after the original infection, triggered by impaired . immunity, being underweight, stress or uncontrolled diabetes. Over the next four months, Alina . became increasingly sick. Her weight plummeted to less than eight stone . and she could stomach little more than baby food. At one point, Alina was referred to a . psychiatrist because doctors, who received 46 phone calls from her . parents over this time, believed her sickness may have been caused by . bulimia. Her distraught father, Sultan Sarag, . claims he was told by one GP, Dr Sharad Pandit, that he was . ‘mollycoddling’ his daughter and that she was just ‘lovesick’. In December 2010, a psychiatrist . reported back that her illness was physical rather than mental, but her . doctors still failed to test for TB. Less than a month later, Alina was no . longer able to walk. On January 6, 2011, she was rushed to hospital . suffering breathing difficulties and died later that day. The . pathologist who carried out the post-mortem examination said her lungs . were ‘the worst we have ever seen’. Alina’s family wept yesterday as a . verdict of natural causes contributed to by neglect was read out at . Sutton Coldfield Town Hall. Mr Sarag, 43, said: ‘I don’t know how I . will ever trust medical professionals again after the heartache they . have put me and my family through. 'Alina deserved far better. We went . back time and again pleading with the doctors to help her but each one . of them let her down. ‘I miss her so much. I still wait for her to come through the door after school.’ Mr Cotter cleared Birmingham Chest . Clinic, a community health facility in the city, and four hospitals of . any gross failure in their treatment of Alina up to October 2010 because . tests at this stage may not have detected the illness. Alina became unwell after a holiday to Pakistan in the summer of 2010 and was seen by two different GPs in the following months . He said it was more likely than not, . however, that Alina would have tested positive for TB by December 8, . 2010, by which time GPs had been told by a psychiatrist that Alina’s . illness was not mental. Mr Cotter said: ‘Treatment could and . should have been started at that time. In my judgment it was a gross . failure not to refer Alina so that tests could be carried out to . establish whether she had active tuberculosis.’ Mr Cotter said he would write to . medical training organisations to voice concern that some of the doctors . did not seem to be fully aware that latent TB can be made active by a . subsequent and different illness. Alina’s family’s solicitors, Irwin . Mitchell, yesterday confirmed they had reported Dr Pandit to the General . Medical Council and will sue the NHS for damages. Dr Pandit, who treated Alina from . birth at Birmingham’s Highgate Medical  Centre, previously told the . inquest that  Alina’s symptoms did not suggest she had TB in late . October 2010, around 11 weeks before her death. He also denied telling . her parents she was simply ‘lovesick’. Another GP at the Highgate surgery, Dr . Khalid Iqbal, told the court he believed Alina did not have active TB . when he saw her on four dates in September and October 2010. The inquest . also heard that Dr Iqbal eventually referred Alina to Birmingham . Children’s Hospital but did not pass on details of her history of latent . TB in his referral letter.","Alina Sarag's worried parents called her GP more than 50 times .

Gone are the days when he would never be seen dead without a cigarette in his mouth and a Rolls-Royce in his driveway. Instead of sporting a bushy moustache, today's gent favours the clean-shaven look and chews nicotine gum. He gets from A to B in a Land Rover Discovery and eats muesli with blueberries for breakfast rather than smoked kipper. Gents: David Beckham has gentlemanly 'good manners', while Sir Walter Raleigh was courteous, according to new book Gentleman's Pursuits, which examined Country Life magazine over the last century . The modern upper class man quaffs New Zealand Pinot Noir instead of claret and is more likely to go tieless than don a cravat. The findings were published in a book called Gentleman's Pursuits, which examined the pages of Country Life magazine over the past century to see how standards have changed. According to the list, an archetypal gent living in 1912 would attend the Proms, live in Belgravia, go tobogganing in St Moritz in Switzerland and enjoy the works of poet and writer Rudyard Kipling. Celebrated: Actor Colin Firth (left) should be admired for his self-deprecation, while polar explorer Ernest Shackleton was a perfect gentleman for rescuing his men . By comparison, the upper-class man of 2012 prefers the mud of Glastonbury music festival, lives in Fulham, goes skiing in Val d'Isère in France and reads historical books by Antony Beevor. Cover: The findings were published in a book called Gentleman's Pursuits, which examined the pages of Country Life magazine over the past century . The book's five gentleman of the year are the Duke of Edinburgh for his 'stiff upper lip', Nelson Mandela for his 'quiet dignity', actor Colin Firth for 'self-deprecation', heavily tattooed footballer David Beckham for 'good manners' and London mayor Boris Johnson for his 'charming apologies'. Its five 'perfect gentleman', who epitomised all that is chivalrous and good about their breed, were named as Sir Walter Raleigh for 'courtesy', the Light Brigade for their 'heroism when facing certain death', dandy Beau Brummell (1778–1840) for 'exquisite dressing', explorer Ernest Shackleton for rescuing his men and Lord Carrington, the former Foreign Secretary and secretary general of Nato, for 'knowing when to resign'. Former England captain Beckham's . inclusion would certainly have been controversial in 1912, given the . number of tattoos that adorn his body, but the magazine said: 'Tattoos were all the rage among gentlemen, including royalty, so Beckham's passion is bang on trend. 'Although the Royal Enclosure at Ascot may take a different view.' There are some things, however, according to the book, that a 'gentleman would never do'. Faux pas include owning a yacht with no sails, wearing pink socks, ordering Cristal champagne and taking a holiday in Florida.

A mother-of-two has been jailed for nine years after she was caught with up to £70,000 of heroin hidden in the soles of her sandals. Noreen Khan, 44, from Derby, was trapped after a UK Border Agency spotted the packages in two pairs of her shoes at Coventry Airport. The officer became suspicious about the package because it did not have a customs declaration attached to it, according to prosecutor Avik Mukherjee. Further investigations revealed that 250g of heroin was hidden in the sole of each sandal. Each shoe had been glued back . together and wrapped in a plastic bag, concealed by clothes. An undercover officer for . the Border Agency replaced the heroin with a harmless substance. The package was delivered to the destination on the label - Khan's home address on March 25, 2011.

An 82-year-old woman wrong-footed her 84-year old next door neighbour when they came to blows during a violent showdown outside their seaside bungalows, a court heard. Widow Patricia Elkin, 82, armed herself with a wooden truncheon and confronted Peter Harper as he brandished a tree branch after a late night bust up. During the ensuing scuffle, retired accountant Mr Harper fell and claimed he was beaten by his elderly neighbour as he lay on the floor and he had to be taken to hospital with a head wound. A court heard the elderly neighbours were locked in a long running feud lasting 12 years but Mrs Elkin was a 'no nonsense' woman who 'would not be intimidated.' Today she showed no emotion as she admitted affray but was spared a jail term after a judge was told the warring pair had now called a truce. Preston Crown Court was told the row was the climax of a long running fall out in which police had previously been called out to reports of trouble at the pensioners’ £150,000 properties in Thornton Cleveleys, near Blackpool, Lancashire. Miss Claire Thomas prosecuting said on the evening of April 18th last year at 11.30pm Mr Harper was getting ready for bed when his security light at the front of the property came on. Miss Thomas added: 'He looked out and saw the defendant standing on the street opposite the address. 'He didn’t know what she was doing so he went to confront her and decided to arm himself with a tree branch in case he needed to defend himself. 'He went outside and shouted something to the defendant. She walked back into her property and took a wooden truncheon which she keeps by the front door and went back outside and a confrontation took place between the two. Both of them were armed. 'There was confrontation and Mr Harper fell to the floor and was struck while he was on the floor. Both Mrs Elkin and Mr Harper each say that the other struck the first blow. Mr Harper fell to the floor and was hit by Mrs Elkin when he was on the floor. 'The police were called and she was arrested and was interviewed and said that her security light had come on. In the interview she said she went and got the truncheon for her defence and she accepts that.' Mrs Elkin originally faced an allegation of wounding Mr Harper with intent to do him grievous bodily harm but the charge was reduced to threatening unlawful violence. At war: The £150,000 bungalows in Linden Avenue, Thornton Cleveleys belonging to Patricia Elkin and Peter Holden. The incident took place outside in the street . One character reference read to the court said: 'She would not be intimidated and will protect her possessions if needs be. She was acting in self-defence. 'She will not stand any nonsense and she should have the right to enjoy her final years in peace. At the very least she can stand up for herself.' In mitigation defence counsel Chris Hudson: 'For the last 12 years Mrs Elkin who is fiercely independent has been blighted by this neighbour. 'In relation to the incident, it is a tragedy for both sides. Mr Harper has had a most unfortunate injury and ended up being taken to hospital and the defendant had the unpleasant experience of going to court on numerous occasions. Mr Harper's wife Imelda said today: 'It was a full moon that night and she’s always odd when there’s a full moon.' 'She has been back at the property and subject to a curfew from 7am until 7pm. She is a keen ballroom dancer and she has not been able to attend. She has lost her good character and she is going to be in the newspaper which is a shame for her. 'The court needs to be assured that this will not happen again.' He added: 'It looks as though there was as scuffle and the police were called to try and calm down the situation. 'The neighbours’ dispute, in my opinion, has been fuelled by both sides and I don’t wish to criticise Mr Harper but he should not have gone out.' 'Mrs Elkin was outside her own property on the far side of the road. He should never have armed himself with a weapon and he should never have gone outside. 'It took place by Mrs Elkin’s own front gate. All she needed to do was shut and lock the door. The consequences were unpleasant for both sides. 'Mrs Elkin has had 14 months time elapse, if anything was likely to spark a repetition it would have happened. 'They have managed to maintain a truce and she doesn’t want any repetition.' Mrs Elkin was ordered to complete a two year community order with a supervision requirement and was ordered to pay £500 costs. Passing sentence Judge Robert Altham said: 'There is a background of animosity between you both. 'On the night in question your neighbour, the complainant, saw his security light come on and saw you were standing on the street opposite his address and decided to go out and confront you and armed himself with a branch which he took from the side of the house. 'He shouted at you and you returned to your house to pick up a wooden truncheon you kept behind your front door and went back outside. ‘It was plainly wrong and it was wrong to take that wooden truncheon outside your house to meet with the complainant. 'It was a decision which you should not have taken. You should not have taken that step or gone back out onto the street.

Blinded: Kardin Ulysse, 14, lost sight in his right eye after being punched in the eye while wearing his glasses at Roy Mann High School in New York . It is unclear if Kardin was blinded after being repeatedly punched or by shards of lens from the glasses he was wearing at the time. He must now wear a patch to protect the damaged eye. Kardin's father Pierre said that his son had been tormented for a long time and in the past had been punched in the face and beaten. Mr Ulysse told CBS New York: 'They called him a whole lot of names, transvestite, homo - all kinds of stuff.' The lawsuit, brought against the city, said the school failed to protect Kardin from his attackers, according to the family's lawyer Sanford Rubenstein. The attackers, who have not been identified, have been arrested and will face disciplinary action from the Department of Education. Charges have not yet been brought against the middle school students.

She is the grande dame of the catwalk with more pedigree than the rest of the London Fashion Week designers put together. And last night, Vivienne Westwood celebrated yet another successful runway show with a packed-to-the-rafters party at Embassy Brasserie. The maverick British designer invited a circle of friends and industry pals to a dinner at the Mayfair restaurant - the second year running she has chosen Embassy for her after-show party... they must be doing something right. Arrivals: Vivienne Westwood with husband Andreas Kronthaler at Embassy Brasserie for her post-show party . Double act: Vivienne works closely with Andreas, her former fashion student and husband of 17 years . A flock of colourful creatures flooded W1 dressed in their finest, filling the restaurant until they spilled out onto the terrace. Westwood, whose Red Label catwalk show was held at the Government's Foreign Office earlier that day, arrived on the arm of husband Andreas Kronthaler after sitting front row at Philip Treacy's comeback show at the Royal Courts of Justice. But for all her success as a designer, and for all the fashionistas, bloggers, stylists and journalists queuing up to get a bit of Westwood wisdom, Westwood, who looked as striking as ever in a dress of her own design, says now she cares little for fashion, using it only as a platform to promote her environmental work. Flamboyant: The upmarket Mayfair postcode got an injection of colour as hundreds of partygoers joined Vivienne Westwood at London Fashion Week's hottest post-show party . Fashion fabulous: Vivienne Westwood enjoyed Benoit Marmoiton's menu with friends at Embassy Brasserie last night . At her show finale she took to the runway in a pair of hot pants and a T-shirt bearing the words Climate Revolution, a moustache and monacle inked on her face with a marker pen, telling her guests to 'Buy less, choose well, make it last.' Wise words. At the party, Vivienne's Climate Change warriors roamed the room in bright green costumes, collecting money for her charity. Guests were left in the expert hands of the restaurant's new star chef, the irrepressible Benoit Marmoiton (how does he keep smiling while serving up 100 covers at once?), who brought out delicate scallop ceviche, burrata with heirloom tomatoes or beef carpaccio, followed by roast cod served with Mediterranean vegetables in Le Creuset pots or slow-cooked beef with roasted new potatoes. It's all about the glamour: Olivia Grant gorgeous in sequins, Laura Whitmore cool in hot pants and Tolula Adeyemi wearing the stunning parrot print scarf dress by Charlotte Taylor with necklace by Denise Manning . Pudding - yes, fashionistas do eat pud - was chocolate mousse with a hazelnut twist, strawberry tart or creme brulée. The soundtrack to the meal was Vivaldi - a personal request from Vivienne, who adores classical music - and the atmosphere in the buzzy restaurant, fuelled by a cool crowd (Nellee Hooper, Tallulah Adeyemi, Olivia . Grant, Lady Victoria Hervey and Laura Whitmore joined in the fun before joining the party downstairs) plus heady CIROC vodka cocktails and excited chatter was such that it was past midnight when guests poured through the doors down the red-lit staircase to nightclub Salon for a riotous party that went on till the wee hours. DJ Erol Sabadosh presided over a packed dancefloor... here are his top three tracks of the night: . Actress Olivia Grant, dressed in oh-so-glam sequins, said she hadn't made it to enough fashion week shows thanks to her filming schedule for new TV show Endeavour - but that she planned to make up for it tonight. 'I  have to be up at 7.30am for work, but I think I may pull an all-nighter in honour of fashion week,' she said. Presenter Laura Whitmore, who'd been busy filming for MTV during London Fashion Week, said she was looking forward to Pam Hogg's show tomorrow, more so because she was the name behind Mary Charteris' wedding dress. Co-owner and operator Dan Kapp said it was a 'total pleasure' to host the Vivienne Westwood dinner for a second season at Embassy Brasserie. 'We love that we share Dame Vivienne's passion for supporting young, interesting talent and artists at Salon too,' he said. The atmosphere was electric, the vibe addictive - to the point that at 3am when sensible London Fashion Week goers should be tucked up in face masks preparing for the next day's early start, they were getting their rocks off to DJ Erol Sabadosh's set, playing table football or posing for photos with the club's giant white gorilla statue - which is set to be auctioned off for one of Westwood's favoured charities Cool Earth later this month (say your goodbyes now). A fitting end to a fabulous day for fashion's favourite Dame. Visit Embassy Mayfair's website at www.embassymayfair.com .","Private dinner held at Embassy Brasserie in Mayfair .

The mother of Guma Aguiar, the missing Brazilian-born, Jewish philanthropist, has said that her son may still be alive, wandering the streets of Fort Lauderdale after experiencing a nervous breakdown. In a petition filed to a Florida court to seize his $100 million fortune, Ellen Aguiar stated that Aguiar 'may be in a delusional state . or be suffering from psychosis or otherwise may have disappeared.' Submitting documents to the Broward County Clerk of Courts, Mrs Aguiar is seeking to  become the conservator and guardian of Aguiar's estate following his disappearance on Wednesday after his empty motorboat washed ashore on a Fort Lauderdale beach. Scroll Down for Video . Guma Aguiar and his wife Jamie pose for an undated picture (left): It has been reported that Mrs Aguiar was unaware that her husband was missing for hours before the police informed her his empty boat washed up ashore on a Fort Lauderdale beach . Ellen Aguiar pictured with her missing son Guma's boat, has filed a legal petition in a Florida court to control his $100 million fortune independent of Mr Aguiar's wife . In her petition, Mrs Aguiar claimed that, 'The Absentee disappeared as the result of mental derangement, or other . mental cause, or, in the alternative, disappeared under circumstances . indicating that he may have died, either naturally, accidentally, or at . the hand of another.' Court documents seen by ABC News show that on May 11, Aguiar amended his declaration which designated guardianship over assets 'in the event of my incapacity' from his wife Jamie . Aguiar to his mother. A version of the document from March had his wife listed as the primary guardian, but in the May version her name has been removed altogether. The legal petition to control his assets lists a $50 million investment portfolio, $15 . million in cash and $35 million in Israeli real estate. Mrs Aguiar has even raised the possibility that her son may have been kidnapped. 'I would be delighted to hear that he was kidnapped and being taken . great care of, and I believe in miracles and would hope for a miracle. I . think, realistically, what happened is pretty clear,' she told ABC News. 'The likelihood is that he was tossed off the boat into the . waves. The boat was found, but the body has not been found.' Without a trace: Guma Aguiar went missing last Wednesday night after leaving his family home . Having searched 1,523 square miles, or . roughly an area the size of Rhode Island, the search for 35-year-old . Guma Aguiar, the founder of a Texas-based energy company worth billions . was called off at 9.p.m on Thursday. Mrs Aguiar, of Pompano Beach, Florida claimed that her son's cellphone and wallet were found on the boat by police according to the files submitted to court reported the Sun Sentinel. The petition filed at Broward County Clerk of Courts also states that Aguiar is on probation . after pleading no contest in February to charges that relate to a domestic . violence case. Mrs Aguiar is looking to control his . fortune to support his wife and son's, to manage his properties and to . pay his employees salaries. 'There is an imminent danger that . the property of the absentee is in danger of being wasted, . misappropriated or lost unless immediate action is taken because the . absentee has disappeared … and assets must be protected from waste . and/or dissipation,' the petition states. His home in Fort Lauderdale is valued at $5 million, he has seven . cars valued at $1.1 million, and a yacht that is valued at $2.1 million states Mrs Aguiar's petition. Speaking to CNN this morning, Mrs Aguiar was unequivocal that her son was having difficulty coping with life. 'He was struggling, he was under tremendous pressures that would not cease,' said Mrs Aguiar. 'And those of us who were very concerned reached out to parties essentially begging them to mitigate him from some of the pressures and allow him to take a break.' The T.T. Zion, the boat that Guma Aguiar was thought to be piloting when he went missing is now being held at a police warehouse in Fort Lauderdale . In 2006, Aguiar sold his company, . Leor Energy, for a reported $2.55billion. Since the sale of the company, . he and his uncle, Thomas Kaplan, have been in a bitter legal battle. According to the Sun-Sentinel, Kaplan . accused Aguiar of believing he was the Messiah. His nephew shot back, . saying the allegation was slanderous and that he never made such a . claim. ‘People have said what an amazing . accomplishment it was that I started a company at 26 from nothing, and . built it up to be so successful,’ he told the Sun-Sentinel in 2009. ‘When I sold the company, I gave credit to God.’ He was also forcibly admitted to an . Israeli psychiatric ward in 2010 after he fell victim to what his family . would later call ‘psychological terrorism.’ They released a statement at the time . saying he ‘has been subjected for a prolonged period of time to . intensive emotional pressures caused by malicious court cases in the . United States concerning past business deals with his uncle.’ Famous friends: Aguiar poses with former presidential candidate Rick Perry while holding the Defender of Jerusalem Award in Jerusalem in 2009 . Keeping kosher: Aguiar embraced his Jewish heritage after being raised as an Evangelical Christian . The 35-year-old energy magnate is . believed to have left his home at around 7.30 p.m. on Tuesday night to . take his private boat out and has not been seen since. According to Rabbi Moshe Meir Lipszyc . of Chabad Lubavitch, Aguiar’s family is ‘completely devastated.’ He . told WPTV: ‘We are hoping and praying for a miracle. We are hoping if he . fell off the boat, that he was able to swim to shore.’ Included in the Coast Guard’s search were two boats, a helicopter and ground crews. News of the mogul’s disappearance has . travelled to Israel, as Aguiar once donated $8million to Nefesh . b’Nefesh, an organisation that helps Jews fund their move to Israel. He . is also a major sponsor of an elite Israeli soccer team. Aguiar was born to Jewish parents but was raised as an Evangelical Christian, he explained in a 2009 Lubavitch article. ‘I came here because I wanted to try something authentic,’ said Aguiar. Guma Aguiar has gone missing after his empty boat washed up ashore at Fort Lauderdale, Florida . Guma Aguiar's vessel washed up here on the sands of East Las Olas Boulevard at around 1.15 a.m. with its navigation lights still on and its engines still running. When the yacht was first found by police, . they immediately traveled to Aguiar's Fort Lauderdale home where his . wife Jaime Aguiar informed officers that she thought he was in his . office. The U.S. Coast Guard, Broward . Sheriff's and Fort Lauderdale Police marine units shortly afterwards . launched a massive search for the missing businessman when he was found . to be unaccounted for. The . missing father-of-four's wife told Fort Lauderdale police that she . has massive concerns for his safety, Detective Travis Mandell said on Wednesday. 'We're all out there, coordinating a search of the waterways, as well . as the ocean, to try to locate if he's possibly in the water,' said Mandell. 'We had . officers scouring the beach on ATVs, searching if he may have come . ashore there. 'Anything's possible at this point, and investigators are pursuing all . leads, so we're hoping that if anyone out there has seen Mr. Aguiar, to . please contact their local law enforcement.' The T.T. Zion was towed up to the boat ramp on 15th Street in Fort Lauderdale and to a police warehouse in the city where it is awaiting police inspection. A friend of the family, Fred Haddad, expressed his confusion, telling the Sun Sentinel that Aguiar was extremely knowledgeable on boats. 'I'm just kind of dumbfounded,' said Haddad. 'I really like the guy. He's as nice as they come.' The local Rabbi, Moshe Meir Lipszyc of Chabad Lubavitch of Fort Lauderdale said that he was devastated for Aguiar's family. Guma Aguiar, 35, and his family live in one of the most luxurious parts of Fort Lauderdale . A map showing where Guma Aguiar lived in Fort Lauderdale at 1500 South 10th Street and where his boat washed ashore on the beach at East Las Olas Boulevard . 'They are all very, very worried about him,' said Lipszyc. 'We are hoping and praying for a miracle. We are hoping if he fell off . the boat, that he was able to swim to shore. He is massively special and . with God's help and all our prayers, we hope he will be OK.' A known philanthropist, the Brazilian born millionaire has donated $8 million in the past to Nefesh b'Nefesh, an organisation that helps American and British Jews move to Israel. Aguiar is also a large supporter of the 'March of the Living' which is an educational program in Poland and Israel designed to continue public awareness of the Holocaust in those countries. He also became a regular on Israeli sports pages when he invested $4 million into Israeli Premier League soccer team Beitar . Jerusalem in July 2009. In September 2009, Aguiar also purchased Jerusalem's leading basetball franchise Hapoel Jerusalem for $1.5 million. Despite his family and business . interests, Aguiar has a history of mental illness and was admitted to an . Israeli psychiatric hospital after claiming to know a soldier in . Israel who had been abducted by the terrorist group Hamas. And court documents indicate that in . 2011, Aguiar's wife Jaime and his mother, successfully petitioned a . Miami-Dade judge to appoint an emergency guardian for him. In . addition, Aguiar and his uncle, Thomas Kaplan have been locked in . litigation over the $2.55 billion sale of an energy company they . co-founded called Leor Exploration and Production LLC which was involved . in gas extraction in Texas. Jewish millionaire, Guma Aguiar, has contributed millions to charitable causes using his oil and gas wealth . Kaplan brought a January 2009 lawsuit against his nephew in which he said Aguiar claimed he was the Messiah. Aguiar denied making this claim. 'People have said what an amazing accomplishment it was that I started a company at 26 from nothing and built it up to be so successful,' Aguiar told the Sun Sentinel in 2009. 'When I sold the company, I gave credit to God.' In the same year, Aguiar pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor drug charges after he was stopped by Broward Sheriff deputies at a  traffic stop. He avoided any jail time for this by tried to level unproven charges of anti-Semitism against the arresting officers.","Missing Guma Aguiar transferred primary guardianship over his personal property 'in the event of my incapacity' from his wife to his mother in May .

Patients with life threatening conditions are struggling to get hold of drugs in 80% of NHS trusts in England and Wales, a survey suggests. Four out of five trusts are reporting delays because medicines intended for NHS patients are exported to other EU countries. Quotas have been introduced to control the amount of drugs set aside for the NHS but this has been found to exacerbate the problem. Shortages: Delays are reported in four out of five trusts because medicines intended for NHS patients are exported to other EU countries . Labour MP Huw Irranca-Davies is calling for action from both the Government and industry, after more than 60 health authorities responded to his freedom of information request about drug shortages. The member for Ogmore in Wales wrote on Twitter: 'Not good enough: over 60 responses from health authorities show gov't & industry need to act on medicine shortages.' The Department of Health said it is considering an investigation into the scale of the problem. A spokesman said: 'It is for manufacturers to ensure that any quotas set are flexible enough to cope with reasonable fluctuations in demand. Where quotas are used, companies setting them should also make sure that they are set fairly. 'Manufacturers should have their own contingency arrangements in place for pharmacies to be able to obtain medicines directly if they have problems getting hold of them. Huw Irranca-Davies MP is calling for action after 60 health authorities responded to a survey about health authorities . 'The government does maintain a buffer stock of certain essential medicines that can be released in emergencies. We will take any action necessary in the event of disruption to supply and distribution of medicines that causes serious risk to patients.' In April health minister Simon Burns told Parliament that the department is considering a one-off survey of shortages of medicines at local pharmacies. Last month MPs in the All-Party Pharmacy Group published a report on their inquiry into medicine shortages, which found that the problem is caused principally by the export of medicines intended for NHS patients to other EU countries. The practice is legal under European provisions for the free movement of goods. The shortages are worsened by attempts by those in the supply chain to solve the problem through quotas and other alternative supply mechanisms, the report said. Pharmacists then spend long periods of time sourcing medicines in short supply, meaning they have less time to spend with patients. Also, patients were found to be suffering as a result of the shortages, with the group citing examples where those with serious conditions such as epilepsy, schizophrenia and diabetes are unable to get crucial medicines when they need them. There were also incidents of people being admitted to hospital as a direct result of medicine shortages. The problem, ongoing for four years, is said to be getting worse, despite attempts by the Department of Health to address it. The MPs said the government could take action as there is scope within European legislation for it to exempt certain goods if their free movement threatened public health. But the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) defended the use of quotas as a legitimate means of ensuring UK patients receive the medicines they need. Their aim is to ensure that pharmacists do not present excessive orders to be fulfilled. ABPI chief executive Stephen Whitehead said: 'We know that quotas are not the perfect answer to the problem: they are a sticking plaster not a cure. In April health minister Simon Burns told Parliament that the department is considering a one-off survey of shortages of medicines at local pharmacies . 'There have been occasions where manufacturers have received orders for medicines which represent more than the entire UK requirement for one particular medicine in one go. In one example a manufacturer received orders equivalent to 26 years' worth of the entire UK supply within a three-month period for one medicine. 'If orders of this excess were fulfilled then we would be left with no stock available for other UK pharmacists and patients wouldn't have access to the medicines they need, when they need them. 'If all the medicines manufacturers provided went to UK pharmacists, they would have in excess of what they need, but while these medicines continue to flow out of the UK these problems will persist. And make no mistake, patients will be affected. 'Removing quotas would not benefit patients but it could cause great harm. The only group who would benefit are the small percentage of pharmacists and wholesalers who actively sell medicines intended for UK patients abroad for a profit.'","Delays are reported in four out of five trusts because medicines intended for NHS patients are exported to other EU countries .

The Longleat Estate is well known for its wild life – both in the safari park and the aristocratic owner’s bedroom. Now the Marquess of Bath’s nephew has added a darker shade to the family’s colourful reputation – by growing 26  cannabis plants in his grace and favour cottage. Alexander Thynne, 50, kept a stash of other drugs, including ecstasy and magic mushrooms, at his home on the estate. Humiliated: Alexander Thynne, 50, (right) stashed the drugs rooms around the cottage Lord Bath (left) provides for him . But the son of Lord Bath’s younger brother has managed to avoid jail and has instead been handed a drug rehabilitation order and told to pay £85 in costs. The police raid on his home is not the first time officers have helped add to visitor numbers at the stately home set in 10,000 acres in Wiltshire. Last summer, they were called in the middle of the night to intervene in an alleged fight between two of Lord Bath’s ‘wifelets’, who were said to have come to blows over which of them would be sharing a bed with the bearded 7th Marquess, now 80. Nor is it the first time Thynne, who is described as an ‘artist’, has had his knuckles rapped over drugs. Illegal substances: Class A, B and C drugs were found in various rooms of the 50-year-old's house . He has spoken previously of his . ‘drugs problem’ and of indulging in ‘too much partying’ after being . caught with ecstasy in his car. Officers subsequently found 42 cannabis plants and other drugs worth more than £3,000 at his cottage. On . that occasion he also escaped a prison term after pleading guilty to . one charge of cultivating cannabis and five drug possession charges. When the case was heard in February 2003 he was sentenced to 180 hours of community punishment and ordered to pay £118 in costs. Aristocratic roots: Thynne is the nephew of Lord Bath, who owns stately home Longleat . His . lawyer later issued a statement appearing to promise that Thynne was a . changed man, saying ‘his past is now very much in the past’. Thynne himself said: ‘I feel very lucky.’ But he was back in court the following year after police seized cannabis at his home. Life is seldom dull on the Longleat Estate owned by the 7th Marquess of Bath, a descendant of the Roman historian Tacitus.His bedroom is covered in scenes from the Kama Sutra and he has often boasted about his numerous female admirers. He married Hungarian-born actress Anna Gael in 1969 and they have two children.But the man sometimes known as ‘the Loins of Longleat’ is also famous for his ‘wifelets’ – rumoured to have numbered as many as 75 – and said to be ‘former glamour girls, actresses, singers and aspiring models’. A recent biography of Lord Bath, whose wealth is estimated at £157million, said a ‘woman on either side of him in bed’ every night is a basic requirement. Longleat House was completed in 1580 and is set in parkland landscaped by ‘Capability’ Brown in the 18th century. A safari park with lions was opened in 1966. He admitted possession of cannabis, was fined £160 and ordered to pay £43 costs. Thynne’s most recent brush with the . law came after officers raided his home in Corsley, Wiltshire, in March . and found 26 cannabis plants in a cupboard. They then discovered stashes of class . A, B  and C drugs kept in other rooms of the house provided for him by . Lord Bath, including ecstasy and magic mushrooms. Thynne claimed he no longer used the magic mushrooms and had forgotten about the ecstasy which he bought at a party. Michael Willis, defending, told North . West Wiltshire magistrates’ court in Chippenham: ‘He had a history of . use and abuse when he was a young man, but he does not supply and he . wants to get rid of this awful habit.’ As well as the drug . rehabilitation order and costs, Thynne was given a nine-month community . order.

"By . Emine Sinmaz . PUBLISHED: . 14:41 EST, 25 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:26 EST, 26 June 2012 . An FBI special agent who tracked down a paedophile and brought him to justice has spoken out about how cooperation from the victim’s family and dedication helped solve the horrific crime. Antonio Cardenas, 33, was sentenced to 35 years in prison last week, and will be on supervised probation for the rest of his life, for repeatedly molesting a Utah boy, now 15, and filming the appalling acts. The sexual abuse began when the boy, who suffers from a learning disability, was encouraged to enroll in a mentoring program in 2004, after he was teased by his classmates. But Cardenas, who was appointed the . seven-year-old’s mentor, instead molested and raped him. He continued to . do so until 2009, which is when he fled to Mexico after images of him abusing the . boy began circulating online. Jailed: Antonio Cardenas, 33, was last week sentenced to 35 years in prison, and will be on supervised probation for the rest of his life, for repeatedly molesting a Utah boy, now 15, and filming the appalling acts . Cardenas had filmed the acts and passed them on to a friend who posted them on to the internet, where they quickly became among the most popularly traded child pornography in the world, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. But the paedophile's apprehension was not easy. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children had seen the shocking footage in June 2009 and passed it on to FBI special agent Jeff Ross, who was tasked with identifying the Hispanic man and young boy in the distressing film. At first it was not clear if the pictures showed other victims being abused too, but Ross’ investigation ‘cemented the fact that it was the same kid, over several years in Utah and Nevada,’ he said. But despite sending pictures of the boy to schools in Utah, reviewing Hispanics listed in the state’s sex offender database and canvassing hotels in Las Vegas where some of the abuse had taken place, the agent was no closer to determining the identities of the two. 'It was a massive undertaking that led . to absolutely nothing,' Ross told the newspaper. 'It was frustrating. We . didn’t find anything.' Justice: U.S. District Judge Clark Waddoups, pictured in June 2007, sentenced Cardenas to 35 years in a federal prison . But a breakthrough came in October 2009 after FBI agents in Los Angeles investigating a ring of paedophiles who traded images of child pornography were led to a Missouri man who had posted images of the Utah boy in question being abused. The man gave agents the victim’s name, and Cardenas’, whom he said had moved to Mexico.Utah authorities told Ross that the child had in fact tried to reach out about the abuse before, telling a school official in 2008 that Cardenas had forced him to watch 'dirty movies', but later retracting his statement. But when he was interviewed by Ross, the boy recounted the years of horrific abuse he had suffered at the hands of the man who was supposed to be his role model. His outraged mother told how the family . had trusted Cardenas, letting him attend a family holiday and even take . the boy on a trip to Las Vegas. He had also stayed in touch with the boy . after returning to Mexico with weekly phone calls and emails. FBI special agent Jeff Ross was also pivotal in the imprisonment of Elizabeth Smart's kidnapper. The 14-year-old was abducted from her bed at her home in Salt Lake City, Utah, at knifepoint in June 2002 by Brian David Mitchell. Smart said Mitchell took her to an encampment near Salt Lake City, pronounced her his wife, and raped her repeatedly. He also forced her to view pornography, drink alcohol and watch him and his wife Wanda Barzee engage in sexual activity. Ross was the agent who interrogated Mitchell on March 12, 2003, the day of his arrest, alongside Salt Lake City Police Detective Cordon Parks, where he said God had commanded him to abduct the girl, now 24. During the two hours of fierce questioning, Mitchell said Smart had had a 'glorious experience' with him during her nine months in captivity. His answers were used against him in his trial and he was sentenced to life in prison. Barzee was sentenced in May 2010 to 15 years for her involvement in the case after she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit kidnapping. Ross had to find out a way of bringing Cardenas back to the U.S. and the boy’s mother had a plan. She said she would pretend the family was throwing a surprise party for the boy, whose birthday is in early January, and invite Cardenas along. It was a difficult plan for the mother, as she was forced to talk to the man who had repeatedly abused her son as if nothing had happened, in the hopes that he would attend. 'She reached out to Tony and lucky enough for us, that’s exactly what he did,' Ross said. 'We would still be dealing with all kinds of treaties, just trying to locate him and get him up here but we used the mom and she was awesome. We wouldn’t have him in custody if it weren’t for her.' Cardenas was arrested on the day of the surprise party in January 2010. 'We had him in custody thanks in large part to mom’s ability to keep her cool and play this script we had written out,' Ross said. Two months later, the agent was working with Interpol in Lyon, France, on child pornography cases when he came across footage of three boys being abused my a Hispanic man while they slept. 'It was the same guy,' Ross said. Until then, Cardenas' family had refused to believe the allegations against him, but when they were shown the new footage to see if they recognised any of the children, they revealed it was Cardenas' own nephews. 'Until that point [Cardenas] was going to go to trial and make us put this kid on the stand and talk about all [these] things,' Ross said. 'Once we showed the family photos of him molesting his own nephews, that’s when he decided he wasn’t going to fight this any longer.' After his arrest, Cardenas allegedly told the FBI that he had not hurt the boy. 'You guys hurt him when you talked to him about what happened,' he said, according to the newspaper. In February this year, Cardenas admitted to travelling from Utah to Las Vegas to engage in a sexual act with a child under the age of 12, between June 2005 and July 2006. He also admitted to engaging in sexual acts with the child in Utah before and after the trip. As part of his plea agreement, prosecutors dropped other counts of aggravated sexual abuse, production of child pornography and distribution of child pornography and agreed to recommend he spend 30 years, rather than life, in prison. But U.S. District Judge Clark Waddoups said that given the age of the victim, and the abuse of his family's trust, he would have to add another five years, according to the newspaper.","Antonio Cardenas, 33, was last week sentenced to 35 years in prison, and will be on supervised probation for the rest of his life .

Guilty: Al Amin Dhalla, 42, has been jailed after mounting a hate campaign against his former girlfriend . A twisted city worker who terrorised his ex-girlfriend's family - stalking them with a crossbow and setting fire to their home - has been jailed indefinitely. Al Amin Dhalla, 42, described as a 'narcissistic psychopath', mounted a chilling hate campaign after being dumped by 35-year-old doctor Alison Hewitt, from Brighton, East Sussex. At one point the police were so concerned for her family's safety that they had to be airlifted from their holiday home on Lundy Island off the Devon coast. The pair met through an elite online dating agency for professionals and had moved in together a few months later. But their relationship soured after airlifted Dr Hewitt’s mother, Pamela Hewitt, and stepfather, David Gray voiced concern over lies they had uncovered about his past. The couple split after a year, triggering a four-month stalking campaign by Dhalla during which he tried to burn down the family home in Buckinghamshire and hired a private investigator to snoop on her. Lewes Crown Court heard Dhalla had a ‘deliberate and chilling degree of planning’ in sending poison pen letters to Dr Hewitt’s colleagues and neighbours. He also set fire to her parents’ home and was eventually found with a cache of weapons including a crossbow in what prosecutor Richard Barton claimed was an attempt to ‘abduct’ Dr Hewitt. Dhalla, a Canadian national who came . to Britain in 2009, was arrested by armed police in April last year . while impersonating a doctor at The Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards . Heath, West Sussex less than two hours before Dr Hewitt was due to start . work. The previous day he . had gained access to the maternity ward where he quizzed her colleagues . about her rota before returning the next day with a loaded crossbow and a . large knife. The court . heard how due to Mr Gray working in the defence systems industry, he is . required to tell his employers about any changes in his family’s . circumstances. Doomed: Dhalla met Alison Hewitt, through an elite online dating agency but their relationship soured after her family voiced concern over lies they had uncovered about his past . Through his own inquiries and those of his employer, it emerged that Dhalla had lied about his past. He falsely claimed that he was 35, an orphan and had lived in Britain for several years. He also did not mention a conviction in Canada for assaulting his uncle with a weapon. His lies led to him being suspended . from his job in December 2010 and in the same month Dr Hewitt, 37, . decided to end their relationship. The . court heard that Dhalla’s behaviour turned increasingly erratic. He at . first refused to move out of her home, forcing Dr Hewitt’s relatives to . evict him. On April 1 last . year, Mr Gray and Mrs Hewitt went on holiday to Lundy Island, with only a . few friends and family knowing where they were heading. The . next day, after buying a .22 air rifle, a 1.77 air pistol and two mini . crossbows, Dhalla was arrested in a field near Chippenham, Wiltshire, . while doing target-practice. Inside his specially-adapted van were . masking tape, tools and details of locations, said by the prosecution to . include Mrs Hewitt and Mr Gray’s holiday spot, their home addresses and . hospitals where Dr Hewitt worked. He . was charged with offences related to discharging the weapons and freed . on bail, a decision described by detectives as 'regrettable”. Stash: When police swooped on Dhalla's van, they found details of where his ex-girlfriend worked, as well as a hoard of weapons . Days . later, while Mrs Hewitt and Mr Gray were still on Lundy Island, he . torched their thatched cottage 220 miles away in Buckinghamshire. After . dousing newspapers with petrol, he set fires by the front and back . doors, but no-one was hurt, although people were asleep in neighbouring . homes. But in a fit of . frustration at seeing his ex-girlfriend’s family home surrounded by . police, he drove to a nearby police station at Wing instead and tried to . burn it down. Dhalla was . sentenced on nine counts, including two of harassment, arson reckless as . to endangering life, theft and possession of an offensive weapon. He . was also found guilty of perverting the course of justice after sending . letters while in custody to Dr Hewitt threatening suicide. He was jailed indefinitely for public . protection and must serve a minimum of six years before he can be . considered for parole, Lewes Crown Court heard. Chilling: One of the two crossbows discovered by police . Judge Charles Kemp said: ‘Miss Hewitt wanted your relationship to end, but you could not accept that. ‘You . harassed her bombarded her with texts, calls and cards and when her . mother uncovered the extent of your lies to her you set about harassing . her.’ ‘You sent letters to . her employers and then your criminal acts became more sinister and . serious and you took items precious to Alison.’ Judge . Kemp said Dhalla was ‘cool and calculated’ when he attempted to set . fire to the family’s home in Aylesbury, Bucks in April 2011 and that he . had a ‘total disregard’ for the safety of others. The . court heard Dhalla was seen by psychologists from Broadmoor while in . custody who described him as ‘narcissistic’ and stated he presented the . traits of a ‘rejected stalker’. He was described as ‘articulate and intelligent’ but was felt to present a ‘high risk’ of reoffending. Defence . barrister David Lamming claimed that Dhalla now felt ‘ashamed’ and . showed ‘remorse’ about his actions but this was disregarded by the judge . who said he felt for Dr Hewitt and her family who had to sit through . the proceedings and give ‘distressing’ evidence. Tools: A police photograph shows a blowtorch and other items that were discovered in the back of Dhalla's specially adapted van . Speaking after the sentencing Dr Hewitt’s step-father David Gray criticised the Home Office and Border Agency for allowing Dhalla into the country when he had a previous conviction in Canada for aggravated assault. Mr Gray said: ‘Mr Dhalla harassed this family and when he didn’t get his way he made three attempts to take our lives. ‘This case has shown yet again the current deficiencies in our border controls. ‘Mr Dhalla should never have been allowed into this country. ‘In discovering his conviction in Canada we informed the Home Office of the threat he posed to us. ‘They ignored our pleas. Even now the UK has no way to stop Mr Dhalla from re-entering the country. ‘It is time the Government took security of its citizens seriously. We are not absolutely certain he is going to be deported after his sentence. ‘We believe this man holds a grudge and he will continue to hold one throughout his life.’","Stalked former lover's family with a crossbow and set fire to the family home .

"By . Chris Brooke . PUBLISHED: . 06:48 EST, 24 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:30 EST, 25 June 2012 . Britain’s biggest funeral firm has been accused of treating the dead with shocking disrespect and stacking bodies ‘like television sets’ at industrial-scale storage units. Instead of being kept in a chapel of rest before burial or cremation, the dead are kept among ‘rack upon rack of bodies’ in a warehouse-style ‘hub’. An undercover investigation revealed overworked staff were ‘treating bodies like luggage.’ Grim: Co-op Funeralcare were shown storing the bodies at a warehouse - the grieving families believed the deceased were at funeral homes . In one incident four bodies had to be transported in the same van and the lid was taken off an elderly woman’s coffin so they could all fit. The woman’s nose was almost touching the shelf above and when the body was unloaded in view of a block of flats a member of staff held the lid over the coffin to ‘preserve some dignity’. Co-operative Funeralcare, which has 900 funeral homes across the country and last year made a profit of over £52million, has apologised for bad practices revealed in Channel 4’s Dispatches programme and has launched an internal inquiry. An investigator for the show worked in one of the hubs, which each serve several funeral homes. Horror: Secretly filmed by Channel 4's Dispatches the findings are horrifying as last year Co-op Funeralcare handled 100,000 funerals last year and made a £51million profit . The investigator saw bodies, some of which were uncovered, being slid in and out of racks just centimetres apart in a refrigerated mortuary. Conditions were described as ‘chaotic’ and staff were accused of breaking the industry code of practice, which requires funeral directors to act in a ‘courteous, sensitive, dignified and professional manner’. Commenting on the storage arrangements, former funeral ombudsman Professor Geoffrey Woodroffe said: ‘I had no idea – they’re treating people as if they’re stacking television sets really. ‘I’d hate to think that a member of my family would have been treated in that way. I find it shocking.’ He also criticised the lidless coffin incident, adding: ‘That isn’t dignified, it isn’t sensitive.’ George Tinning, managing director of Co-operative Funeralcare, admitted the woman’s body should not have been transported without a coffin lid. ‘It’s not right. I’m very sorry about that,’ he said. But he defended the company’s hubs for storing bodies, commenting: ‘I don’t believe it’s industrial, I believe the premises are fitted out to a high standard. Shipped out: The programme showed that if a family member requests to see their relatives again, bodies are quickly returned to the funeral home . ‘I think the key here is the care that we take with the deceased when they are in our premises.’ There was also criticism of sales methods at a branch in Hayes, West London, where trainees were told not to offer the basic £2,010 package to customers. The area manager said: ‘The bottom line is we’re a business and we need to make money.’ Professor Woodroffe said there was a ‘clear breach of the code’ as customers were not being made aware of the full range of services. Mr Tinning apologised for high-pressure selling and promised to address it. Traumatic: Another horrific moment screened is when the wrong body is discovered at a funeral . ‘I’m very proud of the operation  I run, but equally I’m shocked  and disappointed by the things  that you’ve uncovered,’ he told Dispatches. A Co-operative Funeralcare spokesman said no one at the firm had seen the programme, adding: ‘We have a long-established reputation for delivering highly professional services. ‘We are, however, shocked and disappointed by the information provided to us by this programme, which goes against everything we stand for. ‘We do not believe that the instances shown in the programme are representative of our many caring staff. Coffin warehouse: Co-op Funeralcare have said they were 'shocked and disappointed by the information' revealed in undercover investigation . ‘We have, however, launched an immediate investigation into the programme’s findings and will take any action necessary to ensure our high standards and our policy of enabling clients to make informed choices is maintained.’ The firm was criticised three years ago when the wrong body was brought to Teesside Crematorium, followed 30 minutes later by the correct body in a van. Recalling the funeral of her mother Olwyn, Mandy Rowden said: ‘It was awful. Terrible. I couldn’t cry because I was so angry.’ Co-operative Funeralcare later apologised, waived costs, paid compensation and disciplined staff. The Dispatches investigation, Undercover Undertaker, is screened on Channel 4 tonight at 8pm. Allegations: Dispatches suggests the firm could be in breach of industry codes when staff deliberately tried to sell mourners more expensive funerals than required .","Channel 4 Dispatches programme shows casket lid was removed to cram four .

Zisimos Souflas, 27, disappeared in a small town popular with hikers - in a case that came to light just days after a young American woman was found decapitated. There are at least 12 other missing foreign tourist cases in Nepal. The St Andrews University graduate was last seen at a hotel close to where climbers start their walk to the Everest base camp from. Danger: The Foreign and Commonwealth Office have advised people not to hike Nepal alone in light of the attacks on tourists . The graduate left his belongings at Hotel Tibet in Namche Bazaar on April 24, promising to return for them in a few days time. Authorities have not ruled out murder, the Sunday Times reported, although they suspect he had an accident. However, local guides have searched all the paths he could have taken which are all well marked out. Weather conditions at the time were good so the disappearance remains a complete mystery. Zisimos had left his camera, phone, credit cards and driving licence at the hotel. The graduate was reported missing on May 15 by his family when he failed to get his flight back to Manchester Airport. The news comes days after Belgian hiker Debbie . Mavea, 23, was found murdered in the Himalayan mountains. Her body was discovered decapitated near a hiking trail in Langtang National Park. She had her camera and about £65 worth of Nepalese rupees on her, so authorities also ruled out robbery.

Currently, its shelves are offering a . raft of £1 camping trip items for the music festival crowd, ranging from . aluminium water bottles to enamel mugs and bowls, cutlery and emergency . rain shelters.

A care home for elderly people has been criticised by a government health watchdog because most of it staff spoke poor English - and for playing Bhangra music to residents. The owners of the Parkview Nursing and Residential Home in Bolton could face a financial penalty if they do not make improvements, inspectors for the Care Quality Commission (CQC) have warned. The caution comes following a surprise inspection carried out by the CQC, which uncovered a catalogue of failures. Penalty: The owners of the Parkview Nursing and Residential Home in Bolton could face a fine if they do not make improvements . Bhangra music - Punjabi pop often featured in Bollywood films - was played in one resident’s room and, then later, an Asian language radio station - despite their first language being English, and the care plan indicating they liked classical music. And some residents said the majority of staff were hard to understand as their first language was not English. Despite the manager insisting that staff had been informed of English language classes to improve their communication, no member of staff had shown any interest. Inspectors also found some residents looking dehydrated and could find no evidence of staff recording their fluid or food intake. Bhangra music was played in one resident's room - despite English being his first language . Assessors also said no system was in place to monitor the quality of care and the service provided and that they found loud pop music 'blaring out' in the lounge areas. The CQC's report has now been published and a formal warning to protect the safety and welfare of the residents has been issued to owners Jewelglen Limited. It has been ordered to improve standards by July 16 or face a possible suspension or cancellation of services, which the CQC can do in serious cases. It could also face a financial penalty. Despite the concerns highlighted in the report, the inspectors found positive elements to the care home. The home contained cards and letters thanking staff for their care and support and no residents made any negative comments about the attitude or care of the staff. Staff were also observed speaking in a polite manner when addressing the residents and a district nurse said the home always followed instructions. The home, which was inspected on May 14, cares for up to 41 residents with physical difficulties. Mahendra Raja, the home's owner, said the concerns raised had been addressed and solutions would be in order before the next inspection.","Staff played Bhangra music in one resident's room - despite English being their first language .

Complaints about cold-calling telemarketing firms and spam text messages rose more than 40 per cent last year. The latest figures reveal there were more than 7,000 complaints from the public to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in 2011/12, up from fewer than 5,000 the previous year. A Panorama investigation on Monday claimed that the Government-regulated service, the Telephone Preference Service, intended to allow people to block cold callers, was being ignored by some telemarketing firms. Increase: The latest figures reveal there were more than 7,000 complaints from the public to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in 2011/12, up from fewer than 5,000 the previous year . New legal powers mean the worst offenders now face fines of up to £500,000, but despite thousands of complaints to the ICO, the BBC programme revealed there had not been any fines imposed on offending companies for at least 18 months. Information Commissioner Christopher Graham said: 'Last year we gained tough new powers to tackle unsolicited marketing calls and texts. We are working to identify the operators responsible. 'The ICO has executed search warrants at a number of sites across the UK linked to companies we believe are breaking the law. 'We have also set up an online reporting mechanism on our website that allows people to report any marketing texts or calls from unidentified senders.' An exact total of 7,095 complaints were received under the Privacy and Electronic Communication Regulations (PECR), which govern electronic marketing, last year, up from 4,953 in 2010/11, the ICO's annual report showed. Irritating: Cold-calling can provoke a reaction in recipients who often . choose to opt to get such companies blocked. However, investigative . program Panorama has claimed that some companies have ignored this . Mr Graham added: 'We are confident that this work will help us identify those responsible.' Around 17.5 million phone numbers are registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) - a scheme designed to prevent UK-based companies from making unwanted cold calls. Industry rules say telemarketing firms should crosscheck their database to ensure that people who have asked not to be cold called are left in peace. But Mike Lordan at the Direct Marketing Association, which runs the TPS, told Panorama that some companies were ignoring the rules. The UK public receive up to three billion marketing calls a year, Panorama reported. An ICO spokesman said that while they now have the power to impose fines of up to £500,000, enforcing the rules is not easy given the vast amounts of money that companies which flout the rules stand to make.","Panorama claims some companies ignore people's wishes to have cold calls blocked .

Nell Diamond, who turns 24 this month, has come out swinging in support of her embattled father, launching an abbreviated but vulgar taunt against UK politicians as her father becomes the centre of an international investigation into the Libor interest rate-fixing scandal. The raven-haired beauty and Princeton graduate took to Twitter to vent some rage over her father’s ouster, posting: 'George Osborne and Ed Miliband you can go ahead and #HMD'. Charity work: Nell Diamon is a regular attendee at Unicef events, pictured left in 2010 and in 2011, at right . Nell Diamond hides behind a mask at the 2nd annual Unicef Masquerade Ball at in New York City last October . The bizarre insult is defined by the Urban Dictionary as an acronym for 'hold my d***.' Nell and her father are known to be very close, as the two are often photographed together at various events in the last several years. In November 2011, she tweeted a picture of her and her father together at a Jay-Z concert making his famous 'diamond' hand gesture - a symbol for his Roc-A-Fella Records company. In 2010, she was listed among Business Insider's list of Wall Street’s hottest offspring - a grouping of the 1 per cent’s fresh-faced sons and daughters. Diamonds are together: Nellie with her father Bob in a private box at a Jay-Z concert last year. The young bank worker came out in support of her father today . This list placed her in the company of Ivanka Trump and her own brothers Rob and Charlie . That same year, in an interview with Washington University’s Student Life newspaper, she described Princeton as ‘definitely very, very stressful, mostly because of the level of independent work.' She also scribed a piece in a Princeton fashion magazine, in which she reportedly wrote:  ‘Certainly in these trying economic times, it seems not only unethical but impossible for so many people to shell out $700 for a single pair of shoes.’ She is briefly mentioned in the book Too Big to Fail as a support system for her father, who rushed to New York along with her mother to be with him at the height of Wall Street's tumult. In spite of the stresses, Nell, who was president of the Pi Phi sorority, graduated last year with a degree in English after completing her thesis on ‘the Cultural Myth of Female Hair in the Victorian Imagination.’ All a Twitter: Within minutes the offensive tweet was taken down, but not before it was retweeted by Times journalist David Rose . Shortly after graduation, she began working as an analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York, and stays active in charities like UNICEF. Her tweet against Osbourne and Miliband was removed minutes after it was posted, perhaps in light of the fact that the beleaguered Barclays chief is scheduled to face a grilling from the Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday over the rate-fixing scheme. It was replaced with another post, which read: ‘No one in the world I admire more than my dad. 16yrs building Barclays. Shame to see the mistakes of few tarnish the hard work of so many.’ Once translated in the Twitterverse, her 'HMD' remark continued to provoke confusion.

One puzzled Twitter follower wrote: 'So apparently this is what #HMD means but I'm not any clearer as to what it means in this context. #confusedbytxtspk'. The controversy came after Bob Diamond fell on his sword amid intense pressure from on the bank to force him out, it was claimed. Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn .

But despite his resignation, Mr Diamond, 60, shocked the City by defiantly insisting that he would stay on at the bank despite the rate-fixing scandal. The details of Mr Diamond’s testimony . before Parliament  could be highly embarrassing for regulators with . increasing speculation that they were aware of the bank’s practices but . failed to act. His resignation will leave him free to speak openly about what went on at the bank. Mr Diamond is said to be furious that . he and the bank have been blamed for 'lowballing' the rates at which .

'My motivation has always been to do what I . believed to be in the best interests of Barclays.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:31 EST, 4 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:42 EST, 5 July 2012 . Graeme Jarman, 47, who was given a life sentence at Newcastle Crown Court today for the murder of 77 year old Judith Richardson . A dangerous criminal who once dubbed himself 'your everyday psychopath' has been jailed for life for bludgeoning a pensioner to death with a hammer. Graeme Jarman struck Judith Richardson, 77, at least 30 times after forcing his way into her flat in Hexham, Northumberland, posing as a charity worker. Jarman, who consistently denied murder during his trial at Newcastle Crown Court, fled the scene with Miss Richardson’s handbag, sparking a major manhunt before he was arrested in Filey, North Yorkshire, a fortnight later. He showed no emotion as the verdict was handed down  by a 11-1 majority after the jury had deliberated for seven hours. Ordering a minimum term of 35 years, Judge Mr Justice Openshaw said the defendant clearly 'presents an extreme danger to women' and may never be released from jail. He added that Jarman 'has shown not the slightest regret or remorse' after taking the life of 'an entirely decent, respectful member of the community. 'That he will be detained until he is an old man is a price he must pay for committing such a terrible crime.' Jarman, 48, tricked the spinster into opening her front door by showing her Age UK charity leaflets and immediately began battering her. Her ground floor flat was ransacked and her jewellery stolen as she lay dying in her hallway. She was brutally beaten for a second time as the killer left. During the trial, which lasted almost three weeks, Robert Smith QC, prosecuting, said the horrific attack was not random and that Jarman had been following potential victims the day before. What the jury did not know is that Jarman had already been convicted of locking a teenage girl in his car boot and raping her at gunpoint. During the seven-hour ordeal he told her: 'I am your everyday psychopath.' A few years later, he barged into a 23-year-old woman’s home, tied her up and sexually abused her. Jarman, 48, tricked the spinster (pictured) into opening her front door by showing her Age UK charity leaflets and immediately began battering her . He robbed that victim too, before . going on the run, just as he did after murdering Miss Richardson, . changing his appearance as he went. The . court was shown CCTV of Jarman in Hexham the day before the pensioner’s . death last August, which showed him talking to elderly residents. Mr Smith said Jarman was 'observing potential victims'. On the day of the murder, Jarman went to Miss Richardson’s home with the charity leaflets and a hammer he had stolen from a shop in Hexham. Miss Richardson, who lived with her terrier Hamish, was settling down to her lunch of buttered toast. He struck her with the hammer straight after she answered the door and she fell against the wall of the lobby, bleeding from her initial head wound or wounds. Jarman searched her bedroom for items to steal as she lay injured but still alive. She managed to crawl a few metres along the hallway before Jarman struck again more than 30 times. He fled, taking a number of buses to different towns where he bought clothes and shaved his head. He arrived in Newcastle and threw her handbag in a bin before selling her jewellery for £300 at scrap value. A member of the public found her bag, alerted police and officers responding to a simple lost property case were met by a bloody scene. Jarman was finally arrested after the case received national publicity. By then, his DNA had been found on tissues at Miss Richardson’s home. The tissues also had traces of her blood. Jarman’s fingerprints were also found on the charity leaflets. Jarman denied the offence, claiming he took her handbag which had been left outside her home by the real killer. One of the most startling aspects of . the case is Jarman's background. A married former civil servant, those who knew . him described him as well-educated, articulate and sociable. But his outward demeanour hid a terrible catalogue of depravities, . including gunpoint rape, torture, kidnap, armed robbery and indecent . assault. Jurors were shown this hammer, a replica of the one used by Jarman during his attack on Judith Richardson . After he went on the run following Judith Richardson's murder last . August, the police - who suspected he was responsible - warned the . public that his air of normality made him deceptively dangerous. Jarman had previously served long . prison sentences for some of society’s most serious crimes, but . repeatedly convinced parole boards he was rehabilitated and fit for . release. He was jailed for seven years for his . attack on the 23-year-old, but served just three before he was released . in 1991 and married his long-term girlfriend, Tracey. But months later he went missing. On June 7, 1992, in an incident that . bears striking similarities to the murder of Judith Richardson, he . tricked his way the home of a young woman in St-Annes-on-Sea in . Lancashire. Having compiled a 'robbery kit' containing a knife, rope, tape and gloves, he bound and gagged the . 23-year-old and robbed and sexually assaulted her. The prime suspect, Jarman went on the . run only to be caught seven weeks later in the south coast seaside . resort of Hastings and jailed for 15 years. Caught on camera: Jarman is captured on CCTV boarding a bus while on the run from police . He was released after 10, moving to Oxford in 2002 where he slept rough. While on licence, he held a knife to a woman and stole her car, earning him another eight years behind bars in 2003. He was last freed in 2008 after serving just five years and went to live in Stockton, Teesside, before moving north to Consett in County Durham, where police checked on him with monthly visits due to his history of offending. But he last spoke to his family on August 17 last year, then failed to appear at Consett Magistrates’ Court to face a petty shoplifting charge on August 23. Miss Richardson was bludgeoned to death on August 19 in her flat, which was peppered with Jarman’s DNA, prompting a major manhunt involving three northern police forces and 80 detectives.Uniformed officers across Britain were also put on alert and ports and airports were briefed. Police hoped his fragile emotional attachment to his mother Irene, then 71, would be the key to snaring the suspected killer. In a candid appeal, she told her son through the media: 'Graeme, you need to hand yourself in at the nearest police station. It’s the best thing you can do. You’ve handed yourself in before and you can do it again.' Jarman did not hand himself in but was arrested following a tip-off by library staff in another seaside resort - Filey in North Yorkshire - a fortnight after he bolted.","Graeme Jarman, 47, told he'll serve at least 35 years for killing Judith Richardson, 77 .

"Men of the 1st battalion The . Royal Tank Regiment were told while serving in Afghanistan . By . Emily Allen and Leon Watson . PUBLISHED: . 19:34 EST, 4 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:29 EST, 5 July 2012 . The Army will be left at its weakest since 1750 after Philip Hammond announced the biggest shake-up for a century. Despite admitting troops' morale was 'fragile', the Defence Secretary ploughed ahead with axing some of the most distinguished battalions – including those serving in Afghanistan. The plan will contribute to reducing Army personnel from 102,000 to 82,000 – its lowest level in more than 250 years and just half the 163,000 servicemen it boasted during the Falklands conflict. The number of Ministry of Defence civil servants is as many as 80,000. Scroll down for video . Soldiers from The Royal Welsh being inspected by a Zulu leader Chief Berthelezi . Finest hour: Painting commemorating the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift in 1879 by the Royal Welsh, now based in Tidworth, Wiltshire . Famous: British soldiers stand fast against the Zulus at Rorke's Drift in the 1964 Michael Caine film Zulu . Mr Hammond caused outrage by telling soldiers from the 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment (Green Howards) that their unit was being axed as they battle the Taliban. About 50 are attached to the 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment on the front line. And hundreds of troops serving in Helmand with the 1st Battalion The Royal Tank Regiment were informed they will be merged. The cull also hit the historic 2nd Battalion the Royal Welsh, which traces its roots to the battle of Rorke's Drift in 1879, where seven of its men won Victoria Crosses for their stand against the Zulus. In total, 17 major Army units – some dating back more than 300 years – will be lost under the reforms, described by Mr Hammond as a 'vision for the future'. But top brass accused him of 'taking a risk' with Britain's security while Labour said the reorganisation was a 'military gamble'. The 1964 film Zulu, starring Michael Caine as Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead, dramatised the heroism shown by soldier at the battle . Iconic: Zulu starred Stanley Baker (pictured), Jack Hawkins, Ulla Jacobsson, James Booth and Michael Caine and was narrated by Richard Burton . The Royal Welsh, which was created in 2006 by the amalgamation of the . Royal Regiment of Wales and the Royal Welch Fusiliers, can trace its . history back to the defiant stand at Rorke’s Drift during the Zulu War – . at which it won seven VCs. At the time – in 1878 – the unit was known as the 24th Regiment of Foot – or the Warwicks. That historic regiment, which started life as Colonel Dering’s in 1689, became the South Wales Borderers in 1881 and won many honours in The Boer War and the world wars. In Brecon, the South Wales Borderers' museum tells the story of Rorke's Drift along with an exhibition of all the Victoria Cross medals won by the regiment in its long history. In the Zulu War Room, the exploits of the 24th Regiment, known by Queen Victoria as 'the Noble 24th' during the 1879 war are recorded, along with the events surrounding the defence of Rorke's Drift by B Company of the 2nd Battalion, the famous event recorded in the 1960s Sir Stanley Baker film Zulu. The decision to axe the 2nd Battalion means its 640 members based . Tidworth in Wiltshire face an uncertain future. The MoD said staff will . be merged with the regiment's 1st Battalion. Lib Dem MP Sir Bob Russell told Mr Hammond he would 'go down in history as the man who hammered the Army'. The Defence Secretary announced the . Army 2020 overhaul yesterday after postponing the cuts for four months. The Army will end up at its smallest since 1750, when it had 78,900 men. Four infantry units will be disbanded . –  the 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, which in an . earlier incarnation  won six VCs 'before breakfast' at Gallipoli, and . the 3rd Battalion the Mercian Regiment (Staffordshire) joining the 2 . Royal Welsh  and 2 Yorks. A fifth, the Argyll and Sutherland . Highlanders, 5th Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland, will be . reduced to 120 soldiers performing ceremonial duties at Edinburgh Castle . and Holyrood. And critics blasted the decision to . save all five Scottish cap badges – which struggle to recruit enough . troops – at the expense of English ones, calling it a 'shabby political . fix' to avoid handing a propaganda coup to Alex Salmond's . pro-independence nationalists. Two cavalry units will be lost when . the Queen's Royal Lancers merge with the 9th/12th Royal Lancers and the . 1st and 2nd Royal Tank Regiments are combined. The Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, . Army Air Corps, Royal Logistic Corps, Royal Electrical and Mechanical . Engineers and Royal Military Police will also be cut. The first units . will be axed next year. Mr Hammond said the changes were 'difficult and . challenging' but were needed to create a 'best-in-class Army'. He . defended the cuts despite admitting the UK faced an 'increasingly . uncertain world'. Bad news: Hundreds of soldiers were serving in . Afghanistan when they learned that their regiments are to be merged or . disbanded while others will be see their units completely scrapped (file picture) Cuts: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond in the House of Commons today . where he announced that the Army is to lose 17 major units in a cost-cutting service . overhaul which will reduce the Army by 20,000 . Impact: . Soldiers from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion The . Royal Regiment of Scotland (pictured) will have their battalion reduced . in number and will have to perform ceremonial duties instead . This is the full list of unit changes announced today by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond. The infantry will be reduced by five battalions - with the withdrawal of the 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, the 2nd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment (Green Howards), 3rd Battalion The Mercian Regiment (Staffords), and the 2nd Battalion The Royal Welsh (The Royal Regiment of Wales). The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland will be reduced to a public duties company. The Armoured Corps is cut by two units with The Queen's Royal Lancers amalgamating with 9th/12th Royal Lancers (Prince of Wales's) and the merger of 1st and 2nd Royal Tank Regiment. The Royal Artillery will be reduced from 13 to 12 units with the withdrawal of the 39th Regiment Royal Artillery. The Royal Engineers will be reduced from 14 to 11 units with the withdrawal of 24 and 28 Engineer Regiments and 67 Works Group. The Army Air Corps will reduce from five to four units as 1 Regiment AAC merges with 9 Regiment AAC. The Royal Logistic Corps will be reduced from 15 to 12 units with 1 and 2 Logistic Support Regiments withdrawn from the Order of Battle and 23 Pioneer Regiment disbanded. The Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers will be reduced to seven units with the withdrawal of 101 Force Support Battalion. 5 Regiment Royal Military Police will be removed. He said the Government had inherited a . £38billion overspend from Labour. 'We have had to make tough decisions . to implement our vision of a formidable, adaptable and flexible armed . forces,' he said. 'We need to transform the Army and . build a balanced, capable and adaptable force ready to face the future. It will be set on a firm foundation of men and material, well trained, . well equipped and fully funded.' On the axing of the battalions, he . said: 'It is a difficult process. I understand the attachments of the . regions and nations to specific units in the British Army and the . justifiable pride they have in those units. 'But it is absolutely clear this is . about delivering a war-fighting machine. While recognising and honouring . the golden history, our first priority must be looking resolutely to . the future.' Ministers want to double the Territorial Army's size to . 30,000 and he admitted that persuading businesses to allow that many . employees to join as reservists would be crucial. Labour's defence spokesman Jim Murphy . described the plan as a 'military gamble'. He said: 'Jobs and military . capability have been lost and tradition and history have been . sacrificed. 'This isn't just a smaller Army, it's also a less powerful . Army in a less influential nation.' Mr Murphy said that the Argyll and . Sutherland Highlanders were being reduced to 'guarding castles and being . the back drop to Japanese tourists' photographs'. General Lord Dannatt, former head of . the Army, said troops would no longer be capable of two operations at . the same time, such as in Iraq and Afghanistan. Under the reforms, the Army will split into three: reaction forces, adaptable forces and force troops. The reaction forces will be prepared for speedy interventions and made up of three brigades including the Parachute Regiment. The adaptable forces will be dedicated to longer-term engagements, including the Falklands. And the force troops will be made up . of frontline support soldiers such as the artillery, engineers, signals, . intelligence and medical corps. Opinion: The Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Peter Wall, said that under . the plan, the Army would become 'better integrated and fully adaptable' while former Army chief Lord Dannatt, right, said the cuts were 'risky' Three soldiers shot dead in Afghanistan by a man wearing Afghan Army uniform were today repatriated. The trio, members of an Afghan Police advisory team, were killed on July 1 after helping organise a meeting of elders at Checkpoint Kamparack Pul in Nahr-e-Saraj, Helmand Province. They received first aid at the scene but died of their injuries. A man believed to be responsible for the shooting is in custody, the MoD said. Today, Guardsmen Craig Roderick and Apete Saunikalou Ratumaiyale Tuisovurua, of the 1st Battalion the Welsh Guards, and Warrant Officer Leonard Thomas, of the Royal Corps of Signals, were flown into RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. After a private ceremony their cortege passed the memorial garden before heading to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. WO2 Thomas, 44, was on his final tour in Afghanistan, having served since 1990 in units including the Coldstream and Welsh Guards before joining the RCS. Cardiff-born Guardsman Roderick, 22, was a trainee bricklayer before joining the Welsh Guards in September 2009, based in Aldershot. Fijian Guardsman Tuisovurua, 28, had been a soldier for little more than a year, having finished his training and joined the regiment in June 2011, based in Hounslow, west London. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond described the attack on the soldiers as 'cowardly'.Four other British soldiers have died in similar circumstances so far this year. The Ministry of Defence said there had been 16 'green on blue' UK fatalities since 2008, including the seven killed this year. In 2011, there was only one such death. Prime Minister David Cameron has condemned the killings and said the Government would do everything in its power to see that the gunman was brought to justice.","2nd Battalion Royal Welsh, which can trace its history back to the Zulu war, faces axe .

A controversial Jewish circumcision practice in which the blood of a baby's cut penis is sucked by a religious leader has been condemned after the deaths of two infants. The 'metzitzah b'peh' performed by ultra Orthodox Jews sees the eight-day old baby have a traditional circumcision but the 'mohel' then places his mouth around the wound and sucks up the blood. But the practice - intended to prevent infection - has sparked controversy in recent years after the death of two infants and the cntraction of herpes in at least 11 others between November 2000 and December 2011. Controversial: A mohel, left, prepares to carry out a circumcision on a baby boy as prayers are read during a traditional Jewish ceremony (file picture) Heath chiefs in New York are now . pushing through regulation forcing anybody wishing to have the procedure . carried out on their babies to sign a consent waiver. But some Orthodox Jews have complained about the measures claiming that they infringe on their 'religious freedom'. Rabbi Moshe Tendler, professor of Talmudic Law and Bioethics at Yeshiva University, told KTLA that the practice was 'primitive nonsense'. 'The . ritual has nothing to do with religion. It's only their customs. But . they've managed to convince the city that it's a violation of their . religious freedoms,' he added. Circumcision . rituals originate from Scriptures, in which God tells Abraham that all . men must be circumcised eight days after they are born. Jews . believed that blood was the 'life-giving element' and sucking it from . the baby's penis was initially thought to prevent infection. But . medical advances over the last hundred years have made clear that it . can actually spread diseases. It is practiced widely in Israel and among . Hasidic Jews. Devout: Three young ultra orthodox Jews in traditional clothing. The suction practice is carried out among strict followers of the religion (file picture) Homeland: There were almost 20,500 metzitzah b'peh procedures in New York in June this year but the practice is carried out widely in Israel, pictured . Numbers of cases in New York alone emerged after the city's health department launched an investigation following the deaths. The most recent of the deaths was in Brooklyn last September and a criminal investigation is still ongoing. The earlier death was in November 2004, when a twin caught herpes after undergoing the procedure. The other survived. Almost 20,500 baby boys had the procedure carried out in New York in June this year. Some Jews have started using pipettes instead of oral suction because they are more hygienic . According to the findings of the investigation, infants who were circumcise with suction between April 2006 and December 2012 had a risk of catching neonatal herpes (HSV-1) infection of 24.4 per 100,000 cases. New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley said in a statement: 'There is no safe way to perform oral suction on any open wound in a newborn. 'Parents considering ritual circumcision need to know that circumcision should only be performed under sterile conditions, like any other procedures that create open cuts, whether by mohelim or medical professionals.' Jeffrey Mazlin, a certified mohel and physician in New York who regularly practices circumcision procedures, said Orthodox Jews look view the religion as 'more important than individuals'. 'Because blood is the life-giving element, they believe that it's supposed to be part of the whole procedure,' he said, adding that there were 'no known medical benefits'. An alternative to the practitioner removing the blood with their mouth is to use a sterilised glass tube or pipette to create the suction, which some Jews have started incorporating into the ritual. Infectious diseases specialist Dr. Daniel S. Berman defended the practice in a paper published in the Jewish journal Dialogue. He claimed there is no evidence that the 'metzitzah b'peh' procedures caused the infant deaths. Dr Berman also accused New York government chiefs of 'racial bias'.","Two babies dead in New York since 2004 after ritual .

Bizarre: Dancing fanatic Dave Cooper, 48, claims he has been banned from Cosy Joes in Newcastle upon Tyne, because of his dancing . After a few drinks and with the right choice of music, most people lose their inhibitions and enjoy a good dance. But it seems one man's dancing style is so unique it has got him banned from his favourite city centre bar. Dave Cooper was a regular at Cosy Joes in Newcastle's city centre, and could be seen busting his moves on the dancefloor every weekend. But the 48-year-old, who has become an internet star thanks to his American Ninja-inspired dancing, claims he's been barred from the popular nightspot. Mr Cooper - affectionately known as Dishwater Dave - has gained a legion of fans through his dancing routines. He said: 'Me and my friends go out on a weekend for a few drinks and a dance. 'I love to dance because I get frustrated with life. I don't like fighting, I'm not a fighter so I dance.' Cosy Joes - which advertises on its website 'drink, dance, laugh, sing, party' has always been one of Mr Cooper's favourite spots. But a night out to celebrate his birthday ended with Mr Cooper, who works as a dishwasher, allegedly being refused entry. 'Last weekend me and my mates went to go in Cosy Joes, where I've been going for ages, but the bouncers wouldn't let us in,' Mr Cooper said. 'They said they'd had lots of complaints about my dancing because of knocking over people's drinks and stuff. 'I have done that in the past and trodden on people's toes but I always apologise and buy people their drinks back.' He added: 'When I spoke to the manager about it all he told me I was barred because some people who complained said they wouldn't come back if I was allowed to dance in there. 'I said that I didn't just come to dance, I do karaoke as well and the manager said ""yeah, I know mate, you can't sing"" but that's not the point of karaoke. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Complaints: Mr Cooper, pictured on the dancing floor, said he wasn't allowed in to Cosy Joes because they'd had lots of complaints about his dancing and knocking over people's drinks . Dispute: Mr Cooper said he always apologises if he stands on people's toes and said he was told by the manager that he can't sing when he does karaoke - but he's vowed not to let the dispute hinder his dancing . 'I was disgusted by his attitude and more so when he said that my mates were blacklisted too even though they hadn't done anything.' Mr Cooper has vowed to not let the dispute hinder his dancing. He said: 'Even when I was young I used to come home from school and would go straight to my room and just dance away.

And while Cathedral City cheddar may not be found in the fridge of many cheese connoisseurs, it seems the boast is not far from the truth. It is now one of Britain's top 20 most highly-rated brands, according to a survey. The scale of the product's spiralling popularity in recent years has been revealed after it beat some of the biggest names in British retailing - including Waterstone's, Colgate and Dyson to claim 13th place in the YouGov survey. Cathedral City chedder cheese has been rated one of Britain's top brands in a new poll . The product is made from a 25-year-old recipe in Davidstow, in Cornwall -  which is not a city, nor does it have a Cathedral. And it's confirmed popularity will come as a massive . boost to makers Dairy Crest, who spent tens of millions of pounds on a . nationwide TV and radio advertising campaign. Sales of the cheese hit more than £230m last year, accounting for 10 per cent of the nation's cheese market. The brand has also used social media to further its appeal and now has 14,000 followers on its Facebook page. The value of Cathedral City sales have risen by nearly 80 per cent over the past four years and the cheese, which is cut and packaged in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, is now used in one in three British households. Google was knocked off top spot in the YouGov poll by online retail giant Amazon . Food giant Dairy Crest now has an annual turnover of £1.6b, with Cathedral City among its most successful products.

Prosecutors have described how South Florida teen Wayne Treacy kicked 15-year-old Josie Ratley's head 'as if it were a soccer ball and stomped on it as if he was putting out a fire' in a shocking 2010 attack that left her almost dead. Treacy, now 17, cried during prosecutor Maria Schneider's opening statements at day one of his first-degree attempted murder trial today, which was attended by his parents and Ms Ratley's mother, Hilda Gotay. 'He grabbed her head by the hair and started smashing it to the surface...kicked her head as if it were a soccer ball and stomped on it as if he was putting out a fire,' Ms Schneider told the court, according to NBC Miami. On trial: Wayne Treacy, 17, pictured right, cried as he listens to prosecutor Maria Schneider describe his attack . Defense attorneys said they would use the insanity defense, claiming Treacy was suffering post traumatic stress disorder when he beat Ms Ratley to within an inch of her life at a bus stop outside Deerfield Beach Middle School on March 17, 2010. 'He was generally a nice kid, but after his brother died, things changed,' attorney Russell Williams told the court. Police said Treacy, who is being tried as an adult, sought out Ms Ratley, then 15, after she sent him text messages about his older brother Michael, who had recently killed himself. Ms Ratley suffered severe brain damage . in the attack and spent over 40 days at the pediatric intensive care . unit at Broward General Medical Center. Devastated: Victim Josie Ratley's mother Hilda Gotay, pictured left, broke down at Monday's trial opening . Cuffed: Treacy, pictured, was led into the court handcuffed before opening statements in his first-degree attempted murder trial . Prosecution: Assistant State Attorney Maria Schneider, pictured, described how Treacy 'stomped' on Ms Ratley's head during the attack in 2010 . He has been held without bond since the attack and faces up to five decades behind bars if convicted. Mr Williams added that PTSD meant the teenager struggled to control his emotions and actions. Some . of Treacy's friends testified that they had received text messages . about his intent to hurt Ms Ratley, but they thought he wouldn't go . through with the crime. Classmate, William Luft, told the court that Treacy texted him saying he would snap Ms Ratley's neck and 'stomp her head'. The teenager's then girlfriend testified about a text message she said she received from him just after the assault. 'He said, 'I just tried to kill someone,'' she testified on Monday. If convicted, Treacy could get 50 . years in prison. If not, he likely would still spend years in a state . mental institution, possibly even as long as he would spend in prison, . attorneys and legal experts say. 'They often have a difficult time . getting out,' said attorney Richard Rosenbaum, who has represented . defendants claiming the insanity defense and is not involved in the . Treacy case. He . said few insanity defenses succeed because defendants not only must . show a mental illness or defect but also must prove they didn't know . right from wrong. Parents: Wayne Treacy's attorney Russell Williams, right, speaks to Wayne's mother Donna Powers and step father Cary Smith, left, in court . Horror: Wayne Treacy (left), now 17, was 15-years-old when police say he brutally kicked and stomped the head of then 15-year-old Josie Lou Ratley (right) so badly that she suffered permanent brain injuries . 'That's . usually the prong that trips up most of the people who raise insanity . as a defense,' Rosenbaum said. 'It's fairly easy for the state to show . someone knew right from wrong. They knew 'Thou shalt not kill.'' Treacy's defense claims he was suffering . from post-traumatic stress disorder, rooted in his older brother's . recent suicide, when he became enraged outside the bus stop, by an . exchange of text messages with Ms Ratley, whom he did not know. In one of the texts, Ms Ratley tells Treacy 'now go visit your dead brother,' leading Treacy to respond, 'You're (expletive) dead! I swear to God, I'm going to kill you. Your (expletive) is cold, dead meat.' Yet Treacy threatened Ms Ratley several times during their 45-minute text exchange before she mentioned the brother. The whole thing started because Treacy was trying to get in touch with another girl, Kayla Manson, whom he had been dating. Ms Ratley sometimes let Ms Manson use her phone to contact Treacy. Tragedy: After Treacy assaulted Ms Ratley, she was left lying unconscious in a pool of blood and still has mental problems after she gradually recovered . Strategy: Treacy's attorneys said the teen, pictured, was insane when he assaulted the girl and should be acquitted of attempted first-degree murder . Ms Ratley repeatedly referred to . then-15-year-old Treacy as a 'rapist' for dating Manson, who was then . 13. Eventually Treacy texts back, 'Why are you trying to get yourself . killed? I will find you. I will mess you up, you will regret crossing . me.' And, prosecutors say, Treacy calmly laid plans to do just that over the next few hours. Evidence shows that Treacy - a gifted student who did not attend his high school that day - did computer searches on ways to efficiently kill people barehanded, wrote up a short will and hinted to several friends about his violent plans. 'I'm going to jail for murder,' Treacy said in one text to a friend, according to investigative records. Most of the friends said they didn't take the threats seriously. 'He's never hurt anyone before and I . wouldn't think he would ever hurt someone,' said Monica Montero, who . received several texts from Treacy that day. 'Mission': Prosecutors say Treacy dressed in black, including martial arts fighting gloves and his brother's steel-toed boots to ensure maximum damage, before he beat Ms Ratley at a bus stop . Prosecutors say Treacy dressed in black, including martial arts fighting gloves and his brother's steel-toed boots to ensure maximum damage. He then rode his bicycle to the middle school and found Manson, asking her to take him to Ms Ratley. Surveillance video shows Ms Manson leading the much taller Treacy through a crowd of students at the school bus stop, a few moments after Ms Ratley also passed by. The beating itself is not captured on camera. Numerous witnesses say Treacy grabbed Ms Ratley by the neck, knocked her to the ground and began stomping and kicking her. A teacher managed to knock Treacy away from the girl, who was by then lying unconscious in a pool of blood. The teacher, Walter Welsh, then hustled Treacy into the school office and waited for police and paramedics to respond. Mr Welsh said it was clear immediately the attack was planned. 'He was on a mission,' he said. 'I'm going to kill you': The boy's defence claims Treacy (bottom right) was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder following his older brother's recent suicide when he attacked Ms Ratley . Later in a videotaped police interview, Treacy claimed he blacked out during the attack and that he never intended to hit Ms Ratley. Just before the investigator came into the interview room, however, Treacy quietly says, 'I'm a monster. I'm a monster.' Ms Ratley gradually recovered but still has mental problems that prosecutors say may prevent her from testifying. Manson, the girl who pointed Ms Ratley out, faces an August trial on charges of being Treacy's accomplice. For Treacy's insanity defense to succeed, experts say it's crucial that jurors are convinced he had been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder for some time after his brother's suicide. In pretrial hearings, a defense . expert has testified Treacy likely was in period of detachment during . which he didn't know what he was doing. Those periods can last for hours . or days, the expert said. 'Would never have happened': Although Treacy told police he blacked out during the attack and that he never intended to hit Ms Ratley, he earlier said quietly to himself, 'I'm a monster' In a taped jailhouse phone call with his mother, Treacy says he is angry at his brother because the suicide messed up his head. 'If it wasn't for (unclear), I'd be just as normal as I ever was and this would never have happened,' Treacy says, according to a transcript. The prosecution's job is easier, said Nova Southeastern University law professor Robert Jarvis. 'The state has to keep reminding the jury that the defendant is (an attempted) killer,' he said. 'In the end, I think the defense fails in this case because lots of people lose a loved one and still function without engaging in a crime and jurors know that.' Coincidentally, the attack on Ms . Ratley happened several months after a group of students at the same . school, Deerfield Beach Middle School, set a classmate on fire, nearly . killing him. Three boys have been convicted of felonies in that case.","Wayne Treacy cried as prosecutors described the horrific 2010 attack in day one of his attempted murder trial .

He added: ‘Personally I think it’s ridiculous. And punitive. ‘They’re attempting to create a deterrent effect that will not deter and is slowing our progress.’ Mr Arquilla said people with Mr McKinnon’s ability with computers should be considered for a job providing security advice.

Taste tester Angus Kennedy appeared to have the dream job - sampling sweets, chocolate, toffees and other confectionery all day long. But the much-envied father of five has been forced to leave his role as Britain’s ‘Chief Chocolate Taster’ - after piling on two stone. The 47-year-old, who worked from a cosy office at his home in Maidstone, Kent, decided it was time for a change after the doctor told him his cholesterol was dangerously high. Mr Kennedy has now retired from his post as a taste tester - and his job editing Kennedy’s Confection trade magazine - and intends to concentrate on a writing career. The father of five was eating up to 2lbs of ingenious new treats - including cocoa-covered ants and aphrodisiac lollipops - every day.

'It was with regret that I stepped down from the magazine to concentrate on a less harmful - but certainly less sweet - career.' Mr Kennedy has been editing the magazine for the last 20 years. He was dubbed ‘Willy Wonka’ in October 2010 after some of the world’s biggest manufacturers hired him as a chocolate taster.

It includes a section aimed  at children as young as five, asking them to name the body parts on a drawing of a naked man and woman. Another segment intended for eight-year-olds shows a naked cartoon couple chasing each other around a bedroom with  a feather before having sex. Nick Gibb has asked for explicit scenes to be axed from the film . Although the film should be used by . schools only after consultation with governors, many parents say they . were not made fully aware of its graphic contents.
