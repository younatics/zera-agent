"London (CNN) -- It is an unlikely collaboration: She is a fashion designer whose creations have been worn by Madonna, Michael Jackson and Prince while he is a world-renowned polymer chemist. But together, Helen Storey and Tony Ryan are fusing style and substance to create clothes that purify the air we breathe. Their ""Catalytic Clothing"" venture makes use of existing self-cleaning technology found in paints and glass which employ photocatalysts to break down harmful airborne pollutants like nitrous oxide emitted by cars and factories. Applying it to clothing is novel though, and potentially far more effective says Ryan, the pro-vice chancellor at the UK's University of Sheffield. Some rough calculations done while attending a ""really boring meeting"" at the UK's Royal Society of Chemistry, revealed that his suit had a surface area of about 80-square meters. ""The fibers are long and thin, so they have a very high surface area per unit mass,"" Ryan said. ""We already knew that we could get self-cleaning windows and paints. But I thought if I put a catalyst (titanium dioxide) on that surface I can do a lot of environmental clean-up,"" he added. When ultraviolet light hits titanium dioxide it causes pollutants to break down into non-harmful chemicals. Working with Ecover (manufacturers of ecological cleaning products) Storey and Ryan are hoping to deliver the technology through a fabric conditioner with nano-particles of titanium dioxide attaching themselves to clothes during a normal washing cycle. It's a vital technical but also democratic component to Ryan and Storey's approach. ""Rather than going down the traditional fashion route, which make a brand a pre-condition for something to happen, it's taking advantage of human behavior as it exists -- we all wash our clothes, we all walk in the street,"" Storey explains. ""We are empowering people's existing wardrobes with a technology that will allow them to have a significant impact on the quality of air we breathe,"" she added. ""We found out, rather wonderfully, that it works particularly well on denim jeans,"" she added while pointing out that there are more pairs of jeans than people on the planet. Ryan estimates that a pair of jeans weighing 500 grams could absorb around two grams of pollution. Storey's journey away from commercial fashion to her current role -- she runs her own foundation and is currently professor of fashion and science at The London College of Fashion -- began in 1997 with an exhibition called Primitive Streak. Working with her sister Kate (a developmental biologist) she created 27 dresses which depicted the first 1,000 hours of human life. Other projects blending science with art followed before she met Ryan in 2005 collaborating on the Wonderland project where they explored sustainable ideas for packaging and environmentally-friendly fashion, which in turn inspired their latest venture. A four-minute film featuring British model Erin O'Connor and music by Radiohead was launched last year to promote the project and engage the public in the process. Ryan and Storey say more testing needs to be done to assess how the particles released during washing affect the water supply, but they're confident a product could be on the market within the next two years. Frank Kelly, professor of environmental health at King's College London, and an adviser on the project, says air pollution is a major challenge in the 21st century and such initiatives could help. ""We need everything possible to deal with the pollution problem in big cities and this is one more approach that has been suggested could be helpful,"" Kelly said. ""I think the technology has been proven in the laboratory but what we need now is a demonstration that it works in the real world,"" he added. It will also help get the message out about the dangers of pollution, he says. ""My ultimate stance is that we need to make less pollution as a society and then we won't need to come up with fancy and potentially expensive methodologies to solve the problem.""","Catalytic Clothing project creates clothes that can purify city air .

"(CNN) -- This chimp and the rest of a unique population of great apes should be hanging around a bit longer thanks a new conservation commitment in Africa. The Republic of Congo government recently announced the expansion of the Nouabale-Ndoki National Park to include the Goualougo Triangle -- one of the world's most pristine natural environments. James Deutsch, director of the World Conservation Society (WCS) Africa program said: ""Bringing the Goualougo Triangle into the borders of Nauabale-Ndoki will help conserve this landscape's unspoiled richness and provide a safe harbor for these unique apes."" WCS, which first reported the area's ape population back in 1989, worked alongside the government and the country's largest logging company to help secure the new buffer zone that protects over 100 square miles of dense swamp forest and its inhabitants. ""This invaluable insight into the sophisticated minds of Goualougo's chimps would have been lost forever if not for this commitment of the government..."" said John Robinson, WCS executive vice-president of conservation and science. ""These chimps have greatly expanded our knowledge of chimpanzee culture. Continued work to study and protect this undisturbed population is essential,"" Robinson added.","Republic of Congo extend protection of pristine natural habitat .

"(CNN) -- I've been a Mac user for about 11 years. And since I made the switch, I never thought the day would come when I'd say this: . I'm excited for the next version of Windows. This fall, Microsoft will launch Windows 8, a radical redesign from the Windows you've grown accustomed to since Windows 95 made its debut 17 years ago. Windows 8 has been reimagined from the ground up, and it's built to run on both the traditional desktop and touchscreen tablets. At first glance, you'll notice the classic Start menu is gone, replaced by a gorgeous tile layout full of your favorite apps and files. Microsoft calls this the ""Metro"" interface. Imagine it as a blown-up version of the Windows Phone 7 interface used on several smartphones now. Those little tiles provide live updates with news, sports, weather, Twitter mentions and Facebook updates without you even having to open the app. In one quick glance, you can get all the information you need. It's not the same old Windows. And that's what makes me so excited to try the final version of Windows 8 this fall. In a very un-Microsoft move, the company created the most radical redesign of the desktop in well over a decade. It's incredibly functional, too. A beta version Windows 8 is available as a free consumer preview, and I've been using it for the last few weeks. Right now, there are only a handful of prototype tablets that run Windows 8, so I've been using it on a laptop instead. However, since the Metro interface is designed more for touch than a mouse cursor, there's a bit of a learning curve with Windows 8. Scrolling through the Start screen can get confusing on a keyboard until you learn all the shortcuts. But once you do, the experience is incredible, unlike any operating system I've ever used. It's the perfect hybrid of old and new. While Apple attempts slowly to merge its mobile operating system into the desktop with new iPhone-like features, Microsoft made a bold move and jumped ahead to the future where most computing takes place on touch-friendly smartphones and tablets. It's enough to make an Apple fan like me drool. But what if you're worried you won't be able to catch on to the new look in Windows 8? The classic Windows is still there in Windows 8. Microsoft hid it behind the Metro interface. That means you get the same old taskbar, Start menu and desktop full of icons for your favorite apps. It's a great way to ease the transition. Plus, some apps such as Excel and Powerpoint just work better on the classic desktop. Of course, it's far too early to tell if Microsoft's gamble with Windows 8 will pay off. Consumers have been slow to adopt Windows Phones, and Windows 8 is essentially just a blown-up version of that. But if Microsoft can get me this pumped up over a new product, then it must be doing something right.

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal continued his domination on clay as he crushed compatriot Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-1, 6-2 in the second round of the Barcelona Open. The Spaniard carved out 15 break points during the match, polishing off Garcia-Lopez in just over 80 minutes. It was Nadal's 30th straight victory at the event, where he has won six of the last seven titles at the Real Club de Tennis. Nadal has started the season in ominous form. After battling back from a serious knee injury, the world number two won his first title in ten months last week after finally beating rival -- and world number one -- Novak Djokovic in the final of the Monte Carlo Masters. Last year's beaten finalist David Ferrer also cruised into the third round by beating the Serbian Filip Krajinovic 6-0, 6-3. ""I played pretty well, it was a relatively comfortable start,"" the Spaniard told AFP. ""The second set was not as good as the first, but I kept my energy and speed. I had shoulder problems but I had treatment here on Friday. But I still didn't know last Sunday if I could play."" Ferrer, who plays fellow Spaniard Albert Montanes next, will be hoping that his shoulder improves significantly over the next few days: he has lost three finals and counting to Nadal. Elsewhere former women's world number one Ana Ivanovic lost to 21-year-old German wild-card Mona Barthel in the first round of Stuttgart's clay-court WTA tournament. Barthel fired 11 aces as she beat Ivanovic 7-5, 7-6 (7/4) before admitting that the Serb was something of a hero of hers. ""There was something special, because Ana used to be a bit of a role model for me,"" Barthel told AFP. ""I was still at school when she won the French Open and I watched it on television. ""At that time all this was a long, long way off for me."" Ivanovic has struggled to recapture the form that saw her win the French Open four years ago. The same can't be said for Barthel who has had an incredible 2012. She won the Hobart WTA tournament in January before reaching the third round at the Australian Open. She was only stopped by eventual winner Victoria Azarenka, the current world number one. Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska eased into the quarterfinals when she beat Hungary's Greta Arn of Hungary 6-3, 6-4.","World number two Rafael Nadal starts with win at Barcelona Open .

"London (CNN) -- This April, in Washington D.C., ministers from developed and developing countries will discuss how we can prevent the unnecessary deaths of over a million children a year. Death caused mostly by diarrhea due to a lack of safe drinking water and sanitation. Deaths that outnumber those caused by AIDS, malaria and measles combined. In fact, the biggest cause of child deaths in sub-Saharan Africa and the second biggest worldwide. The Washington gathering, as part of the Sanitation and Water for all partnership, comes soon after the announcement that the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target to halve the number of people who do not have access to safe drinking water has been achieved, a full five years ahead of the target date. The news that an additional two billion people now have access to safe water in the last 20 years is certainly a cause for celebration, but our journey towards universal access to water still has some way to go. Now is not the time for complacency. Despite this recent progress, 783 million people from the poorest and most dispossessed communities across the world do not have access to safe drinking water. They will be the hardest to reach, the most marginalized and excluded. If context was needed for the scale of the challenge, we are talking about reaching the equivalent of over two and a half times the population of the U.S. with clean water. We should focus first and foremost on the poorest of the poor when investing in water. They must be our priority moving forward. Basic systems that can be managed by communities themselves accounted for less than 20% of donor funding to the water and sanitation sector in 2010. This is a worrying statistic as it will leave many of the 783 million without access to safe water on the sidelines. You certainly won't hear these people celebrating achieving this water Millennium Development Goal when their need remains so great. But more worrying still, is the consistent failure to achieve the other half of the same MDG goal -- that of halving the proportion of the population without access to basic sanitation. A staggering 2.5 billion still live without toilets, and access to sanitation is one of the most off-track targets of the Millennium Development Goals, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. On current trends, it will be over 250 years before the region has universal access to both water and sanitation. Graphic: How much water does the world waste? Having clean water and safe sanitation transforms lives, such as that of Yacouba Doumbia a student from the Simba East school in Mali. ""I used to get sick, especially with stomach aches and headaches. Having the new toilet has made things easier for us because if we need to go to the latrine we can and there is water and soap to wash our hands after. We collect water from both the borehole and well,"" Doumbia said. ""We drink from the borehole and wash our clothes from the well. I can see a lot of difference. For me the borehole water is tastier. I used to get sick when I drunk from the well water. I used to suffer from stomach aches."" So the question is now how to get these services to everyone on the planet. How do we repeat the improvements in the lives of Yacouba and his community with the billions who are still waiting for these services? That is the challenge facing the Sanitation and Water for All partnership when it holds its biennial meeting in April, a meeting I am honored to have been asked to participate in. Thirsty for knowledge? Take the water security quiz . This group of ministers and officials are committed to the endeavor of bringing water and sanitation to all. We have to make sure that we back up their drive and ambition with the political will and the investment required to provide these essential services to every person on the planet. We have it in our power to provide water and sanitation to everyone within a generation. Let's put ourselves on the path to achieving this crucial goal.

"Washington (CNN) -- Forty-three Transportation Security Administration workers in Florida are facing disciplinary action for not performing additional screening on random carry-on bags and passengers, according to TSA spokesman David Castelveter. It happened over two months last year at Southwest Florida International Airport in Fort Myers. Castelveter said 300 to 400 randomly selected people and their bags should have been given a secondary screening after passing through the initial security checkpoint but were not. All passengers received the initial screening. About 3.8 million passengers were screened last year at the airport. How much do we really hate the TSA? Castelveter said the incident was reported by TSA employees and identified in an internal investigation. ""TSA holds all of its employees to the highest professional and ethical standards and has a zero tolerance for misconduct in the workplace,"" he said in a statement. ""Accountability is an important aspect of our work and TSA takes prompt and appropriate action with any employee who does not follow our procedures and engages in misconduct."" Under TSA labor rules, five workers face firing and 38 others may receive two-week suspensions, Castelveter said. TSA agents have been brought in from other locations to ensure passenger safety, he said. One congressional critic of the TSA said the incident is another in a string of TSA lapses. ""Recent meltdowns such as those in New York, Newark, Palm Beach, Honolulu, Charlotte and Los Angeles have become familiar,"" Rep. John Mica, R-Florida, said in a statement. ""For example, TSA recommended firing 36 employees in Honolulu for improperly screening luggage, and 12 others in Charlotte (North Carolina) for similar reasons. In Newark, a total of 10 workers were fired or suspended for theft or sleeping on the job.""","43 workers from Fort Meyers airport face firing or suspension .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. official ridiculed as ""another blatant lie"" a Syrian government report Thursday asserting that terrorists -- not security forces -- massacred civilians in Houla. Last weekend's massacre, which left more than 100 people dead, sparked outrage across the globe and prompted calls for action against the regime of Bashar al-Assad. But Syria attributed the latest violence to ""armed terrorist groups,"" the vague entities that the regime has blamed all along for widespread violence against civilians during the nearly 15 months of unrest. ""The goal of the armed operation was to completely terminate the presence of the state in the area and to make it one that is out of the control of the state,"" Qasim Jamal Sleiman, head of the investigative panel, said in televised remarks. ""All of the martyrs are from peaceful families who refused to stand against the state and have never demonstrated or carried weapons against the state. They were in disagreement with the armed terrorist groups, which confirms that there was a goal and an interest to kill them."" The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, called the Syrian account ""another blatant lie"" and said there's no ""factual evidence"" to ""substantiate that rendition of events."" She said the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland, could soon embark on an effort to establish facts in the case and hold people accountable. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said the international community needs to ensure al-Assad steps down. ""There is no question that we are very concerned about the atrocities that are taking place in Syria,"" he said. ""Just makes clear how important it is to remove Assad from power and to try to implement the necessary political reforms that are necessary in that country."" The Syrian government investigation said 600 to 800 armed people gathered after Friday prayers at two primary locations and committed the crimes. Sleiman said firearms shot from a close distance and sharp objects were used, but there was no shelling. ""The place where the massacre was committed is an area where armed terrorist groups are present,"" Sleiman said. ""The security forces did not enter the area before or after the massacre and the area is far from the checkpoints where the security forces are positioned."" But he said security forces ""defended themselves against the armed terrorist groups."" Some of the attackers hailed from the Houla area, investigators said. ""Also, some of the bodies that were shown as part of the massacre are bodies of armed individuals who were killed during their attack on the security forces and they are not from the town."" Politicians across the world, opposition leaders and Syrian citizens blame the regime, citing witness accounts that pro-government forces were responsible for the Houla bloodshed. They say government forces have been responsible for violence in Syria since March 2011. The massacre spurred diplomatic action this week. The United States, Netherlands, Australia, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Bulgaria, Turkey and Canada announced that they are expelling Syrian diplomats. Rice has said the massacre was carried out by Shabiha militias or local gangs acting on behalf of the regime. Survivors told Human Rights Watch that the army shelled the area and ""armed men, dressed in military clothes, attacked homes on the outskirts of town and executed entire families."" A network of Syrian opposition activists, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, blamed ""armed militias"" of the Syrian government. ""This barbaric act was preceded by the regime's mortar shelling in the town,"" the LCC said in a statement. ""The campaign ended when the armed militias slaughtered entire families in cold blood."" Sectarian tensions have been high in Houla, which is overwhelmingly Sunni and is surrounded by Alawite and Shiite villages. The regime is dominated by Alawites. The government report came as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ramped up pressure Thursday on Russia, saying the Kremlin has been an obstacle to peace in Syria. ""I think they are, in effect, propping up the regime at a time when we should be working for transition,"" Clinton told reporters in Denmark. The United States and Russia have been looking for solutions to the 15 months of persistent violence. Estimates of the number of dead range from 9,000 to more than 14,000. The United States is focused on supporting U.N. and Arab League envoy Kofi Annan's six-point peace plan. The administration is hoping Russia can persuade Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to adhere to the plan and keep the country from deteriorating into more warfare. The Syrian regime said it supported the Annan plan, which includes a cease-fire. But so far, according to the secretary of state, the Syrian regime has failed to abide by the initiative. ""The Russians keep telling us they want to do everything they can to avoid a civil war because they believe the violence will be catastrophic"" and they have likened the situation to the ""equivalent of a very large Lebanese civil war,"" Clinton said. ""They're just vociferous in their claim that they are providing a stabilizing influence,"" she said. ""I reject that."" Clinton urged leaders in Syrian society and the military to use their influence to avoid a full-blown civil war. She said countries like the United States and Denmark are ""appalled"" by the violence and want ""to win over those who still support the regime inside and outside of Syria to see what options are available to us."" ""We're also aware that there is still a fear among many elements of the Syrian society and the Syrian government, that as bad as the Assad regime is, it could get worse,"" she said. ""And we therefore continue to call upon the business leadership, the religious leadership, the military leadership, those voices within the government that know what is going on is leading to the very outcome they fear most -- which is a sectarian civil war -- to stand up now and call a halt to further support for this regime."" Merchants in Aleppo shut their stores to register their disgust with Houla on Thursday, echoing the same angry gestures that were made last Monday in the historic Hamidiyeh Bazaar in downtown Damascus. ""We carry the responsibility for continuing to work while people are dying,"" said an Aleppo store-owner who asked to only be named Abu Karim, in a phone interview with CNN. ""That is our shame,"" he said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon referenced the Houla incident on Thursday in Istanbul, Turkey, saying ""the massacre of civilians of the sort seen last weekend could plunge Syria into a catastrophic civil war -- a civil war from which the country would never recover."" ""I demand that the government of Syria act on its commitments under the Annan peace plan,"" he said. ""A united international community demands that the Syrian government act on its responsibilities to its people."" Britain's U.N. Ambassador, Mark Lyall Grant, said Thursday that he was not prepared to pull the plug on the peace plan. ""Clearly it is on life support but it isn't dead, yet,"" he told CNNI's Christiane Amanpour. ""We are directing all our efforts into trying to make it work,"" he said. ""But I think to make it work we're going to need to increase the international pressure on the Syrian regime."" Grant praised the role U.N. observers played in bringing that incident to light: ""To be honest, we would not know exactly what had happened in Houla had it not been for the observers able to go there, to demonstrate that there had been tank tracks, that there had been use of heavy artillery, that there had been a massacre by the Syrian regime,"" he said. ""Otherwise, people would give some credence to this report that the Syrian government has come out with today claiming that it was nothing to do with them. We know that's a tissue of lies partly because the U.N. observers are able to say so."" Russia and China have been more receptive to the Syrian government during the crisis, and have blocked tough action against the al-Assad regime in the U.N. Security Council. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said this week that ""certain countries"" were attempting to use the Houla massacre as a ""pretext"" for a military operation against al-Assad's forces, which have been partly armed by Russia, Russia's RIA Novosti reported. Lavrov also accused the head of the opposition Syrian National Council of attempting to ""incite a civil war."" The government also said proposals by Western powers to arm rebels would ""prolong the conflict."" Since the conflict began, the government has blamed the violence against civilians on armed terrorist groups. But opposition groups and citizens have blamed the government. Violence continued in Syria Thursday, with at least 61 people killed in the country, the LCC said. Syrian forces shelled Houla again early in the day, and 29 people were killed in Homs alone, it said. CNN cannot confirm death tolls or reports of violence from Syria because the government limits access to the country by foreign journalists. Syrian opposition fighters issued the government a Friday afternoon deadline to cease fire, pull out troops from residential areas and allow humanitarian aid. The Free Syrian Army, mainly comprised of military defectors, said it would stop adhering to the Annan plan if the government doesn't begin to adhere to it by then. ""Our national, moral and humanitarian duty make it necessary for us to defend and protect our civilians and their cities, towns, blood and dignity,"" the group said in a statement. The ultimatum lists a series of demands in a peace plan implemented last month and brokered by Annan. ""Immediately halting gunfire and all violence, pulling out all the troops, tanks and machinery from residential areas, allowing humanitarian aid to reach all stricken areas, releasing all prisoners and allowing media access,"" said Col. Qasim Saad Eddine, the group's spokesman. Eddine also called for the freedom to demonstrate, an end to attacks on U.N. monitors and a dialogue on power handover. Meanwhile, Syrian authorities freed 500 prisoners arrested for their alleged involvement in the uprising, state TV reported Thursday. CNN's Amir Ahmed, Faith Karimi, Ivan Watson, Yesim Comert, Omar al Muqdad, and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice calls Syrian account ""another blatant lie""

"New York (CNN) -- A member of Pedro Hernandez's family walked into a Camden, New Jersey, police station in the 1980s and reported that Hernandez told relatives and others that he had killed a boy in New York and threw the body near a Dumpster -- but there's no indication anything came out of that report, the family member told CNN. ""You feel like they didn't believe you. I felt empty and a little bit mad,"" the relative said. ""I was expecting something else."" Now, 33 years after Etan Patz disappeared, Pedro Hernandez stands accused of choking to death the 6-year-old youngster after luring him to the basement of a corner grocery store in New York City, and of throwing away his body inside a trash bag. The family member, who CNN has agreed to not identify, said there was no receipt of paperwork to document the information provided -- nor was the relative ever contacted again about the report. ""Police asked whether I was mad"" at Hernandez or had an ulterior motive, the source added. Hernandez allegedly confided the information to a New Jersey church prayer group that included some members of his family and his then-spiritual adviser, the source told CNN. Tomas Rivera, a leader of the prayer group, declined comment Monday on Hernandez or the prayer group, citing authorities who told him not to talk to the media. Pastor: Wife of suspect in Etan Patz case 'absolutely shell-shocked' At 19, shortly after Patz's disappearance on May 25, 1979, Hernandez left his job as a stock clerk and returned to his mother's home in North Camden, New Jersey. The attempt to tell police that Hernandez might have killed a child happened a few years after that. CNN has not been able to reach Camden police for comment. ""When he moved home, he was really nervous and shaking all the time,"" the family source said of Hernandez. ""He constantly had diarrhea, and he spent a lot of time just looking out the window,"" the source added, saying the behavior was out of character for Hernandez. Hernandez also allegedly told his first wife that he had killed a boy, according to the source. CNN has not been able to reach her. The two divorced, and Hernandez has remarried. Neighbors say suspect in Patz killing lived a quiet life with his family . Before Hernandez was picked up for questioning last week, the family source was visited by police and asked about any previous confessions from Hernandez about killing someone. Surprised to be contacted after so many years had gone by without hearing anything, the family member asked, ""What took you so long?"" The family member didn't get an answer and doesn't know what prompted police to visit. The relative had no explanation for why no other relative spoke up years ago. ""Maybe they didn't want to get involved,"" the source said. ""I wasn't going to stay quiet. I have a conscience."" The family source said he was surprised on Friday, when Hernandez' defense attorney announced in court that his client has a long psychiatric history, is on medication for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and suffers from hallucinations. Attorney Harvey Fishbein said Hernandez -- who was on suicide watch at Bellevue Hospital on Sunday -- has not entered a plea due to a pending psychiatric evaluation. New York police say they tracked down Hernandez after a tipster they won't identify contacted police last month. The person came forward after seeing publicity surrounding the FBI's search of an unrelated basement in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood, a half block from Etan Patz' home. New York police have not responded to a request for comment about the latest development. But in a press conference Thursday, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said no family members or spiritual advisers ever contacted police. It's not clear whether Kelly was referring to the New York Police Department or any police department. Meanwhile, police have asked New York's Sanitation Department for trash pickup and dumping records dating back to 1979, said Vito Turso, a spokesman for the department. ""We said we would search for those handwritten logs,"" he said. However, he said, businesses in the area could have hired private companies to haul away their trash, and ""we would have no records of their pickup schedules."" The Patz case was the first of several high-profile cases that catapulted concern about missing children to the forefront of national consciousness. The relative of Hernandez is concerned about what Etan Patz's parents must be going through. ""At this moment, they must be hoping this is the right guy, and they don't go through this again,"" the source said. ""It's going to be like a nightmare for them, if it turns out it's not Hernandez."" ""They must want to know the truth and get this over with,"" the relative added. ""At least they will know.""","Pedro Hernandez is accused of choking to death 6-year-old Etan Patz .

"(CNN) -- Jennifer Tyrrell, an Ohio den leader dismissed by her local Boy Scout troop for being a lesbian, said she's disappointed her 7-year-old son is no longer participating in the Scouts. ""He's no longer a Boy Scout,"" Tyrrell said Wednesday of removing her son, Cruz, from the group. ""And we're sad about that, but we can't support an organization that doesn't support our family."" Tyrrell is now engaged in a campaign with Change.org, a left-leaning political group, to raise awareness of the policy of the Boy Scouts of America, garnering 140,000 signatures and saying that she ultimately wants the national organization to reverse its position. ""This isn't about my sexuality; this isn't about anybody's sexuality,"" Tyrrell said. ""It's about teaching children to be better adults, and we aren't doing that by teaching them to hate or discriminate."" LZ Granderson: Boy Scouts feel a mother's wrath . A 2000 U.S. Supreme Court decision found that a New Jersey law requiring the national organization to readmit an openly gay Scout Master infringed the organization's First Amendment right of expressive association and that it had a constitutional right to oppose homosexuality in its ranks. ""Forcing a group to accept certain members may impair the ability of the group to express those views, and only those views, that it intends to express,"" then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote at the time. He added that the decision was not meant to approve or condemn the Scouts' view on homosexuality. The Boy Scouts of America said in a statement that its ""membership standards are founded on the values, expectations and beliefs of those we serve."" ""We recognize that there will be a range of views on this topic, and Scouting's policy is not meant as a social commentary outside of our program,"" Boy Scouts of America spokesman Deron Smith said.

"(CNN) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad denied Sunday that government forces were behind the ""outrageous"" massacre of more than 100 civilians, including dozens of small children, in the town of Houla.

Al-Assad's remarks stand in stark contrast to what the opposition and many world leaders have said for more than a year -- that al-Assad's forces, not ""terrorists,"" are behind a sustained slaughter stemming from the regime's crackdown on dissidents. As the president spoke, heavy shelling rained on the anti-government bastion of Homs, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Thirty-seven people were killed throughout Syria on Sunday, including five children, the group said. Opposition activists also reported seeing a large military convoy of about 45 trucks carrying tanks, armored personnel carriers and soldiers heading toward Deir Ezzor during al-Assad's speech. Al-Assad insisted ""the battle is forced upon us,"" but promised amnesty for those who stop fighting immediately. Russia strikes back amid accusations it's not doing enough about Syria violence . ""I encourage all of those who are hesitant to drop their weapons at once, and the government will not seek revenge now or later,"" he said in his 70-minute speech. ""We forgave others who stood against us in the past."" The president also touted what he called political reforms and denounced those he said were conspiring against Syria. ""Standing up against the conspiracy is not easy, but we will overcome the obstacles,"" al-Assad said. iReport: Putin visits Berlin for talks over Syria . The president's address came a day after U.N. special envoy Kofi Annan said Syria is ""at a turning point"" and that ""the specter of all-out civil war, with a worrying sectarian dimension, grows by the day."" Saudi Foreign Minister Saud Al Faisal said the Syrian regime is pushing for a sectarian crisis. ""The Syrian opposition lacks the means to defend itself, and the regime is getting weapons from everywhere. For a while now, we noticed that the regime has been trying to turn the crisis into a sectarian conflict,"" Al Faisal said Sunday. He added that while Syria had agreed to Annan's peace plan, the regime has not implemented it. ""The regime just wants to buy time,"" Al Faisal said. Catherine Ashton, the EU foreign policy chief, said no efforts should be spared to stop the violence. ""We need to avoid a catastrophe. Violence and repression cannot be the solution. Any further militarization of the conflict will bring enormous suffering to Syria and risks having a dramatic impact on the region,"" she said. As Annan's U.N.-backed peace plan continued to founder in Syria, Arab leaders signaled the need for more robust measures to end the violence there. At a meeting in Doha, Qatar, more than a week after the Houla massacre sparked global outrage, Arab League Secretary-General Nabil el-Araby said ""more audacious steps are needed"" in Syria. ""We should have a timeline for the peace plan -- this is a must,"" el-Araby said. ""The international community needs to take immediate action after the massacre in Houla and take all necessary measures in order to protect the Syrian civilians."" Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabor Al Thani said Annan's peace initiative should be placed under Chapter VII of the U.N. charter, Qatar's news agency reported. Such a move would allow the U.N. Security Council to take action that could include the use of military force. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Sunday that he had taken note of the Arab League leaders' suggestions, including requests to increase the number of U.N. observers and to set a time limit for the effort. ""All these are very important recommendations and I hope these will be discussed by the Security Council members. At this time, I would welcome the wider international discussions on the future course of action,"" he told reporters. The crisis in Syria began nearly 15 months ago, when a tough government crackdown on protesters spiraled out of control and spawned a national anti-government uprising. The United Nations for months has said more than 9,000 people have died in Syria. But death counts from opposition groups range from more than 12,000 to more than 14,000. Tens of thousands have been displaced. Syria, Sarajevo and Srebrenica: When outrage isn't enough . The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 33 civilians and 61 government forces were killed across Syria on Saturday, and two rebel soldiers died. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties or violence from Syria because the government restricts access to foreign journalists. Over the border in the Lebanese city of Tripoli, fighting between pro- and anti-Syrian regime gunmen on Saturday left 12 dead and approximately 50 injured, according to the state-run National News Agency. The clashes continued early Sunday morning, killing at least one person, NNA said. But hours later, residents said the situation in Tripoli was quiet. The sectarian violence in Tripoli mirrors the tensions in Syria between Sunnis, who make up the majority of the Syrian opposition, and Alawites, who are dominant in al-Assad's government. Annan made reference Saturday to such flare-ups in neighboring countries, after many Syrian civilians have fled to escape violence.

"(CNN) -- The name he chose for the next installment in his ""Metal Gear"" video game series makes Hideo Kojima seem prescient. As the famed shepherd of the spy franchise he created 25 years ago, Kojima remains deeply involved in the game development process. Yet, Kojima hadn't foreseen that his project would undergo a death and rebirth, like the phoenix bird from Greek mythology. As it turns out, the irony of the name ""Metal Gear Rising"" is unintentional. ""I canceled it,"" Kojima said of the game, in a recent phone interview with CNN. ""I made the decision. I just thought that nothing good would come out of this."" Instead, ""Rising"" is back on track. The new chapter is meant to be a sort of departure for the series, emphasizing action and swordplay over the stealth movements that ""Metal Gear"" games are renowned for. In June, a fresh take on the game that was once killed will be ready for gamers to play for the first time at the E3 industry trade show, reports Japan's Famitsu magazine. Developers at Konami and Kojima Productions had initially spearheaded the project, then called ""Metal Gear Solid: Rising,"" as they've done for most games in the franchise. A version for Xbox 360 was announced in the summer of 2009. Kojima had placed ""Rising"" in the hands of some young developers within his company, but they didn't have the expertise to deliver the action game he wanted, he said. ""It was almost lost when they were making it,"" Kojima said. ""It's not that we do not have any good game designers in our development team. However, the concept for 'Rising' was completely new."" With ""Rising"" shelved, Kojima and his teams continued to work on their various other ""Metal Gear"" projects, including a high-definition remaster of older games that hit stores in November and a mysterious open-ended game that Kojima is reluctant to talk much about. Rumors had begun to surface that the game would not get made, and that piqued the interest of a little-known Osaka, Japan, developer named Platinum Games. When Kojima spoke with executives there about reviving the project, they were enthusiastic, he said. Platinum delivered a thorough proposal, which won Kojima over, he said. The game and its story have changed considerably from the original concept, said Kojima, who is an executive producer on the project. Even the name is different. It will be called ""Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance"" when it debuts this year. ""If this game becomes hugely successful and popular, then we might make it into a franchise,"" Kojima said. In a game about sword fighting, support for the latest motion-control gaming systems -- Microsoft's Kinect and Sony's PlayStation Move -- would seem to be a natural fit, but Konami has not described how it will be controlled. In a previous interview, Konami President Shinji Hirano declined to comment on the game's control scheme. After ""Rising,"" Kojima expects more ""Metal Gear Solid"" games to be made, but he hasn't decided whether he will design them, he said. Gamers recognize Kojima's meticulousness, which is why he has such a dedicated following. (He has about 136,000 people following his Japanese Twitter account, and another 89,000 following an official English-translation page.) Evidence of his perfectionism can be found in the development of ""Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D,"" a remake of an 8-year-old game to be released on Nintendo's 3DS hand-held system. The 3DS has two screens, one of which can display games in three dimensions without requiring the player to wear special glasses. ""We are trying to make it as easy to use as possible,"" Kojima said. ""We're taking a lot of care in the very small details, like when you lay down, using the screen below to change your weapons.""","The ""Metal Gear Solid: Rising"" game was initially canceled .
The project was revived with the help of a third-party developer .

"Bellefonte, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Five men and four women have been selected to be jurors in the Pennsylvania trial of Jerry Sandusky, the former Penn State assistant football coach charged with child rape. About 220 potential jurors reported for duty Tuesday, after the court whittled the number to about 600 based on answers to questionnaires sent to prospective jurors' homes. Of those, about half were sent home and asked to return Wednesday. ""We are now making good progress,"" Judge John Cleland said late Tuesday afternoon. Twelve jurors and four alternates will eventually be selected. Sandusky, 68, has been under house arrest since being charged with sexually abusing 10 boys for at least 15 years. Prosecutors allege he met some of his accusers through Second Mile, a charity he created for underprivileged children. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. He and his attorney, Joe Amendola, were in attendance Tuesday. Keys to the case against Sandusky . Opening statements are expected to begin Monday, the judge said, and the trial is likely to last about three weeks. Sandusky supposedly wrote love letters to one of his alleged victims, Victim 4, ABC News reported late Tuesday. They will be read into testimony, ABC said. When asked by CNN about the report, the attorney for Victim 4, Ben Andreozzi, said he expects that letters from Sandusky to his client will be introduced at trial, but declined to comment on their content. Gifts Sandusky allegedly gave to Victim 4 may also be introduced as evidence by prosecutors, according to a source close to the case. Those gifts could include golf clubs and football jerseys, the source said. A source close to another alleged victim, Victim 1, said Victim 1 received birthday cards and notes from Sandusky, but that they were not sexually explicit in nature. They included statements such as, ""I love you,"" but did not contain anything overtly sexual, that source said. Authorities allege that Sandusky abused some of the boys on the Penn State campus. The case has shaken the university, raised questions about its response to the allegations and drawn criticism from those who claim Penn State put its reputation ahead of protecting potential child victims. University President Graham Spanier and iconic head football coach Joe Paterno lost their jobs soon after Sandusky's arrest amid criticism that they did not adequately handle the matter when allegations involving Sandusky arose years earlier. Paterno died of complications from lung cancer in January. Mike McQueary, a former graduate student considered to be a key witness in the Sandusky case, has testified that he alerted Paterno in 2002 that he'd seen what appeared to be Sandusky sexually assaulting a boy in a shower in Penn State's athletic facilities, an allegation that authorities didn't learn of until years later. Paterno apparently told the university's athletic director, Tim Curley, but no one notified police. Curley and Gary Schultz, Penn State's senior vice president for finance and business, are now facing felony charges of perjury and failing to report the allegations to authorities. Prosecutors said later that the McQueary incident took place about a year earlier than was originally alleged, causing defense attorneys for Curley and Schultz to argue that one of the charges should now be dropped. Both of them have pleaded not guilty, and their attorneys have said that prosecutors ""charged this case before (they) knew the facts."" Potential jurors were asked Tuesday about their relationships with Penn State, local law enforcement and Second Mile, and whether they had contributed to any of those entities. Several reported knowing Sandusky or his wife, while others said they had volunteered at Second Mile. Others said they were current or former Penn State employees. Prosecutors plan to call more than 50 witnesses during the trial, and the defense plans to call about 100, including Jay and Sue Paterno, Joe Paterno's son and widow; McQueary; his father, John; and Spanier, among others. The prosecution is preparing witnesses for their testimony next week, according to several sources close to the case. The 28-year-old man known as Victim 4 is expected to testify first, with Victim 1, who started the investigation by coming forward in 2008 and alleging years of abuse, to follow, the sources said. McQueary and his father were told to be in town and ready to testify next Wednesday or Thursday, one of the sources said. Cleland told members of the jury pool that jurors in the case will not be sequestered, saying he will trust them not to read newspapers or follow the case online. He told the prospective jurors that after he speaks with them, groups will be taken to another room for questioning and then to a different room for more questioning from the judge and attorneys. If they are selected, he said, they will be taken to a different room. ""We're using all the rooms,"" Cleland quipped as pool members chuckled. Sandusky listened intently to the judge as he spoke to the jury pool, also chuckling at times. But he looked down when the judge discussed the charges against him. As jury selection in the case began Tuesday, Penn State released a statement, saying, ""The acts that Jerry Sandusky is accused of committing are horrible and if proven true, deserve punishment."" The university said it would not comment on the specifics of the legal case, but said it hopes that the trial ""provides answers we are all seeking"" and that ""the legal process will start to bring closure to the alleged victims and families whose lives have been irrevocably impacted and that they can begin the healing process."" Several of Sandusky's alleged victims, including Victim 4, asked a judge to protect their identities at trial. However, Cleland ruled Monday that the alleged victims' identities may not be concealed during the trial, although they will be protected through the jury selection process. ""Courts are not customarily in the business of withholding information,"" Cleland's ruling said. ""Secrecy is thought to be inconsistent with the openness required to assure the public that the law is being administered fairly and applied faithfully."" Prosecutors in Sandusky case present new, graphic details . But, the judge noted, ""It is also to be hoped that various news organizations that will report on the trial will use what has become their professional custom to protect the privacy of alleged victims."" CNN generally does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault. Victim advocacy groups criticized the judge's decision late Monday, expressing their hope that it would not have a chilling effect on the reporting of child sexual abuse. ""The judge placed a significant burden on this class of victims by stating that they have 'a duty to the community to testify' about the crime, but denying them privacy protections in exchange for that testimony. By bravely coming forward, victims serve in the interest of public safety; they should be assured that their privacy will be protected,"" the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape, the National Center for Victims of Crime and the National Crime Victim Law Institute said in a joint statement. ""In society, sometimes we question why rape victims are reluctant to come forward,"" Andreozzi, attorney for Victim 4, said Monday after the ruling. ""So now we have our answer. ... We are disappointed."" ""We are not asking to close the courtroom, only to use a pseudonym,"" he said. His client will still testify, he said, ""but at what expense to his emotional well-being?"" He said he expects the defense to attack his client on the basis of a meeting he had with Sandusky in the years after the alleged abuse. ""My client couldn't break free,"" said the attorney, describing the relationship between Victim 4 and Sandusky as ""complex."" Psychologist flagged Sandusky as 'likely pedophile' in 1998 report . After news of the scandal broke last year, The New York Times published an extensive interview in which Sandusky attempted to clarify his relationships with young people. ""If I say, 'No, I'm not attracted to young boys,' that's not the truth,"" he said, according to the story. ""Because I'm attracted to young people -- boys, girls -- I ..."" His lawyer, who was present at the interview, spoke up at that point to note that Sandusky is ""not sexually"" attracted to them. ""Right. I enjoy -- that's what I was trying to say -- I enjoy spending time with young people. I enjoy spending time with people,"" Sandusky continued. ""I mean, my two favorite groups are the elderly and the young.""

"(CNN) -- U.S. Army Sgt. Steve Flaherty was in a tough spot and he knew it. ""If Dad calls, tell him I got close to being dead but I'm O.K.,"" he wrote to his mother. ""I was real lucky. I'll write again soon."" Not long after that, Flaherty's luck ran out in the jungles of Vietnam. He never wrote to his mother again. His letter to his mother, along with at least three other letters, fell into the hands of North Vietnamese soldiers when he was killed in March 1969. Now those handwritten letters are on their way home. Nearly four decades after the end of the Vietnam War, the United States and Vietnam have exchanged personal papers taken from the dead bodies of each others' troops for the first time, the Pentagon announced Monday. While the letters themselves are still in Asia, their emotional impact has already hit home for members of the Flaherty family. Martha Gibbons said Monday that recognizing her late brother-in-law's handwriting immediately and reading of the carnage he witnessed tore at her heart and reinvigorated the positive feelings she has for him. ""I've always loved Steve and admired his courage and character,"" she said. ""And this just made me admire and respect and love him even more."" Vietnamese Defense Minister Phuong Quang Thanh gave U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who was on a historic visit to Hanoi, the letters taken from Flaherty's body and later used in Vietnamese propaganda broadcasts. Panetta announces new strategy with Asia . A top Vietnamese colonel, Nguyen Phu Dat, kept the letters since the war, and mentioned them last summer in an online publication about documents from the war years. A retired Pentagon prisoner-of-war and missing-in-action expert ran across the reference a few months later, the Department of Defense said. The Pentagon and State Department worked with counterparts in Vietnam to arrange the handover of the Flaherty letters to Panetta, who will have them returned to Flaherty's family. In exchange, Panetta handed over a diary taken by U.S. Marine Robert Frazure from the body of Vietnamese soldier Vu Dinh Doan in 1966. Frazure had brought them home to Walla Walla, Washington, and kept them after his discharge from the military. He later gave them to the sister of one of his buddies killed in the war as she researched the conflict. She passed them to the PBS program ""The History Detectives,"" who tracked down Vu Dihn Doan's family and gave the diary to American officials to hand back. As to Steve Flaherty, he was the biological son of a Japanese mother and American father who was adopted as an adolescent from an orphanage in Japan. He soon became a proud son of the Flaherty family in South Carolina, where he was a star student, athlete and ""caring, loving young man,"" according to the now 73-year-old Gibbons. ""Everybody who met him loved him,"" she recalled. ""He was very smart, very athletic, very proud of his country -- just a wonderful young man."" A college student with pro baseball prospects, Flaherty joined the Army willingly ""because he felt it was his obligation,"" his sister-in-law said. He was eventually dispatched to Vietnam, informing his family of the perils there by mail, even as he likely shielded the worst of it from his adopted mother. Gibbons, though, said the excerpts she's read from his recovered letters gave her new appreciation for his courage, as well as sadness that he had to deal with such terror. ""I was in tears (reading the letters) thinking of how he must have felt, how afraid he must have been yet determined to do his duty, as he stood there with bullets flying around him,"" she said. ""I knew he was in danger, but I never knew he was in that kind of danger. I just wept for him, and I wish I could have been there to help him."" Gibbons said the family had no idea such letters existed until about six weeks ago, when she was contacted by former Defense Department official Robert Destatte, who'd translated parts of the online Vietnamese publication. It wasn't until Sunday that she read a new message from Destatte, telling her the letters may be exchanged the following day. On Monday, Gibbons said a top aide to Panetta called her from Vietnam, setting off a whole new wave of memories and emotions. ""It is like going through the funeral all over again, with a different feeling,"" she said. Himself seeing the Flaherty letters for the first time on Monday, Panetta said ""a lot of blood was spilled"" on both sides but he ""hopes it helped in healing relations"" between the two countries. JoAnne Shirley, whose brother Maj. Bobby Jones is the only flight surgeon still missing from Vietnam, praised Panetta's efforts. ""It shows the concern that our own government has for our guys that are missing in action or killed in action,"" she said. ""There are certain areas of Vietnam that we have never had access to,"" she said. Panetta's involvement ""sends a message to the Vietnamese that we do care and are interested."" Panetta announced Monday that Vietnam is opening up three new areas of the country for remains recovery operations. Shirley, a former chairman of the board of the National League of POW/MIA Families, said it also sends an important signal to troops fighting abroad now. ""It should send a message to those who are serving today, as well, that we are not going to to leave them on foreign soil. That we do care about them,"" she said. And she said the government has a responsibility to its troops. ""Thousands of Americans are still missing from World War II to the present. We have an obligation to these guys that we send into harm's way,"" she said. Panetta is on a tour of Asia that includes Singapore and India. His trip aims to boost military ties in the region. On Sunday, he visited a former U.S. Navy base in Cam Ranh Bay, marking the first trip to the base by an American defense secretary since U.S. forces pulled out of Vietnam nearly 40 years ago. Standing on the USNS Richard E. Byrd, Panetta said the Vietnam generation ""is my generation."" He called on those present to ""heal the wounds of the past,"" saying it makes the sacrifices of those who died worthwhile and will help build a better future.

"(CNN) -- ""I've broken my shoulder, broken my knees, broken my feet, broken my hands, I've broken ribs, I've broken the coccyx in my back."" Off-road bicycle racing is a rough and tumble world, and three-time BMX world champion Shanaze Reade has suffered enough injuries to end any sporting career. Fortunately for the British Olympian, she is made of stern stuff, mentally and physically. ""When I was leaving primary school I wanted to be a BMX racer,"" the 23-year-old told CNN. ""My teachers and my family would say, 'How are you going to make a career out of BMX racing? It's not even an Olympic sport!' "" Gold medal formula: Mind over matter? That changed in 2003, when the International Olympic Committee announced that BMX would be a full medal event at the 2008 Beijing Games. BMX, inspired by motocross, started life in the late 1960s as kids playing on bikes in California. It has since evolved into a sport which pits highly-trained athletes against each other over one white-knuckle lap of a dirt course. ""It's grown a massive amount,"" said Reade, who has also won track cycling world titles alongside 2008 Olympic gold medalist Victoria Pendleton. ""Before the Olympic Games in 2008 it was big, but then after ... people understood our sport a lot more. Kids started coming along to the tracks, adults started coming along. People who raced back in the '80s, they started coming back into the sport."" London 2012: A swimmer's story . Having qualified for the four-rider women's final at Laoshan in 2008 after a series of grueling qualifying heats, Reade -- already a double world champion and the favorite to clinch the sport's inaugural gold medal -- had the chance to justify the career choice she had so stubbornly made as a child. But it was not to be. ""Everything seemed to come to a complete standstill,"" said Reade, who crashed out of the deciding race after clipping France's eventual champion Anne-Caroline Chausson. It was a sad conclusion to an uneasy Olympic campaign in which she also crashed during the individual time trials and the first semifinal heat. But the final, unlike the semis, offered Reade no chance of redemption once her face had hit the dirt. She was left to contemplate giving up on her Olympic dream after just one attempt. ""How hurt I felt from that race, I was like, 'Do I even want to do sport anymore? Do I want to be in sport if this is the way it makes me feel?' "" But Reade's mental strength came to the fore and, over time, she regained her composure and confidence ahead of a home Games in London later this year. ""Time is a great healer. I got up, brushed myself down and I thought, 'This is what I am good at and this is what I trained for.' "" She will again enter the competition as a strong gold medal contender after clinching her third world title in Adelaide in 2010. The prospect of being backed by thousands of partisan fans at the Olympic Park's BMX track, combined with her victory at last August's Olympic test event, has given Reade plenty of cause for optimism. ""I've never performed in front of 6,000 people before and I've never competed in front of 6,000 British people who are all behind you,"" she said. ""I think the atmosphere is going to be electric there and really motivating at the same time."" If Reade once again comes up short in her pursuit of gold, then at least she has learned not to let sporting shortcomings drag her down. ""My motto is life and in sport is 'happiness is the key to success.' You can be successful, but without happiness it means nothing. That's definitely what I go by.""","British BMX rider Shanaze Reade is a gold medal favorite for London 2012 .

"(CNN) -- England coach Roy Hodgson has overlooked experienced international Rio Ferdinand for a second time after electing to call up Liverpool defender Martin Kelly as a replacement for the injured Gary Cahill. Chelsea's Cahill suffered a double jaw fracture in England's 1-0 win over Belgium on Saturday, but instead of turning to Ferdinand, who has 81 caps, Hodgson drafted in Kelly -- who only made his international debut last month. When Hodgson named his 23-man Euro 2012 squad last month he said he omitted the 33-year-old for ""footballing reasons,"" having been asked if it was because of John Terry's impending court case for allegedly abusing Ferdinand's younger brother Anton. Manchester United's Ferdinand used his official Twitter account on Sunday to say, ""What reasons?????!!!"" His agent Jamie Moralee released a statement accusing Hodgson of a ""lack of respect"" for the center back. ""Rio's very disappointed,"" said Moralee. ""He thought he had done enough. It's very difficult to accept. ""This is a player with 81 caps for his country. I don't know anyone who understands it. It's not been handled in the right way."" England's preparations have been overshadowed by Chelsea captain Terry's trial, which takes place after the June 8-July 1 tournament in Poland and Ukraine. Terry denies the charges. Terry and Ferdinand have been England's preferred defensive pairing in recent years, but while the former will travel to the team's base in Krakow this week, the latter's international career now appears to be over. Cahill joined clubmate Frank Lampard in withdrawing from the squad, with the veteran midfielder ruled out last week due to a thigh injury. Manchester City midfielder Gareth Barry also misses out with a groin injury. France coach Laurent Blanc also faces injury worries ahead of the opening Group D match against England in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk on June 11. Rennes midfielder Yann M'Vila is struggling to be fit after picking up an ankle sprain during Thursday's 2-0 win over Serbia, which the French Football Federation described as ""moderately serious."" However, Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger has recovered from a calf injury and the Bayern Munich star was due to fly out to the 2008 finalists' tournament base in Gdansk on Monday. Croatia striker Ivica Olic has been ruled out with a hamstring injury, and coach Slaven Bilic has replaced him with Nikola Kalinic of Ukrainian club Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk.","England coach Roy Hodgson overlooks defender Rio Ferdinand for a second time .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court is prepared to take on an emotionally charged case: the massive health care reform legislation championed by President Barack Obama. The court will hear six hours of oral arguments over three days on the law's constitutionality. Here are some frequently asked questions on the crucial issues: . Question: What is the law and who is challenging it? Answer: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was passed by Congress in 2010 by a Democratic congressional majority with the support of the president. It has about 2,700 pages and contains 450 some provisions. The signature policy accomplishment thus far of Obama's presidency, the comprehensive legislation has received mixed reviews in the lower federal courts. Preview: 'The implications ... are impossible to overstate' One part of the law stands as the focus of the judicial dispute and threatens to collapse the entire legislation. The ""individual mandate"" provision requires most Americans to purchase health insurance by 2014 or face a financial penalty. Its purpose is to spread health care costs to a larger pool of individuals. Various states and individuals have argued the Constitution's Commerce Clause does not give government the authority to force Americans to purchase a commercial product such as health insurance they may not want or need. The opposing states equate such a requirement to a burdensome regulation of ""inactivity."" The Justice Department has countered by saying the changes do not amount to taxpayer financing or a new government-run program. Supporters say Congress wanted to ensure universal coverage by forcing insurance companies to expand coverage without bankrupting them. The individual mandate, they argue, will ensure enough money is in the system to benefit all Americans. Federal officials cite 2008 figures of $43 billion in uncompensated costs from the millions of uninsured people who receive health services, costs that are shifted to insurance companies and passed on to consumers. The largest and broadest legal challenge to the PPACA comes from a joint filing by 26 states, led by Florida. It was that series of appeals the high court has accepted for review. Lawyers for the states and a private business coalition will argue their case against the Justice Department, representing the administration and Congress. An insider's look at how the Supreme Court works . Question: What specific issues will the court address? Answer: The court will decide four separate legal questions in these appeals: . -- Key issue: Does the law overstep federal authority? This is particularly in regard to the key coverage and funding provision: an ""individual mandate"" requiring most Americans to purchase health insurance or pay a financial penalty. -- Domino-effect issue: Must the entire PPACA be scrapped if that key provision is unconstitutional? -- National policy implications issue: Are states being ""coerced"" by the federal government to expand their share of Medicaid costs and administration, with the risk of losing that funding if they refuse? -- Jurisdictional issue: Are the lawsuits brought by the states and other petitioners barred under the Anti-Injunction Act, and must they wait until the law goes into effect? This simplifies the legal issues to some extent, given the sweep and complexity of the healthcare law. The high court's focus will be more about how to pay for the medical care, and less about the new or expanded services the law would guarantee. Question: I won't be among the lucky few who can get seats to these historic arguments. What will go inside the courtroom? Answer: The court has carved out its entire week of arguments for this issue -- six hours spread over three days -- in an extremely rare move. Ceremony and decorum will reign. Court sessions begin promptly at 10 a.m. ET, with the marshal calling the court to order. The chief justice, contrary to popular belief, does not use the wooden gavel. The audience rises as the robed justices enter through red velvet curtains from a back room. After a scripted welcome read by the marshal -- ""oyez, oyez, oyez..."" -- the sessions begin. Chief Justice John Roberts will announce the case and arguments will proceed. The four appeals here will each last from one to two hours, and each side's lawyers will get equal time. The public is invited but seating is limited to about 400. Many spectators wanting to view history will camp out in line many hours before, on the court's marbled outdoor plaza, waiting for a precious seat. Question: I know they're called arguments but is that what the justices will be doing -- fighting among themselves? Answer: ""Argument"" is misleading but does reflect the adversarial legal system unique in many ways to the United States. Essentially the lawyers separately presenting their cases will be peppered with questions from the justices, often rapid-fire and legally dense. No witnesses, testimony or visual presentations are allowed. A good appellate lawyer standing at the lectern will be able to think on her feet, answering the questions without giving away too much. Many veteran attorneys will say it is hard to sway a justice at argument to your side, but it's easy to cede your core position with a weak presentation. Confidence but not arrogance is the tricky balance a lawyer must navigate, as is the ability to anticipate where the line of questioning may lead. A case does not reach the high court because it is easy, and that is true with this complex health care law. The justices inevitably tread on the rim of the nation's laws -- the ""outer markers"" as Justice Stephen Breyer put it -- and must craft a constitutionally credible ruling that will establish precedent, addressing guidelines for courts perhaps many decades. To help them, the justices offer hypotheticals in their questions, seeing how far the Constitution or issue at hand can be taken and still satisfy judicial scrutiny. The more outrageous the hypothetical, the easier it sometimes is for a wavering justice to get her head around a troubling aspect. Tensions do get high in the court sometimes, as the justices not only compete for time to ask questions but spar over ideology and legal reasoning. The chief justice is the gatekeeper of sorts, keeping the debate civil and ensuring one justice does not step on another and that a lawyer has time to answer the question. Seniority gives way when two justices talk at the same time. Reporters and court watchers will look for clues in the justices' comments and questions about how they will eventually vote. A withering line of questions from justices on both the left and right aimed at one lawyer does not necessarily spell doom for a particular side, but it may give the bench more to think about than they had anticipated. Some justices, such as Antonin Scalia, will bluntly tell his colleagues at argument what he thinks of the case, while others, such as Sonia Sotomayor, are more opaque, equally tough in questioning both sides. Justice Clarence Thomas has not spoken at argument in more than six years, preferring to let the lawyers plead their case without much interruption. That scenario will not happen on this ""hot"" verbally active bench. Question: So what happens afterward? Answer: One thing is certain: We will not get a ruling from bench at argument or shortly thereafter. The justices will meet privately as a group, perhaps Thursday or Friday, where they will go ahead and vote on the four issues. The chief justice will lead the debate, going by seniority down the line. Each justice will say how he or she votes and can offer a brief explanation of the reasoning, brief being the key word. The current bench does not favor long-winded discussions at their closed-door conference, the substance of which is never revealed publicly. The court speaks through, and draws it power from, their written opinions. Thus the opinion-crafting process is all-important. The chief justice -- when he is in the majority-- has the power to assign the author of the main ruling. Remember, there are four issues here, and we will likely get four separate written decisions. Because the questions are related, it will make the writing and collaboration process that much more difficult, so it is likely we will not get opinions until late June. Five votes are needed for a majority. The losing side by tradition drafts a written dissent. The real work of the court goes on behind the scenes as the justices communicate with their respective chambers to craft majority and dissenting opinions that each side can sign onto in support. An individual justice has the power to write a separate ""concurrence,"" supporting the outcome, but for different legal reasons. The more concurrences that pop up, the less force that majority opinion commands, since future courts will see mixed messages over the legal interpretation. Divided 5-4 rulings also diminish the force of jurisprudence, since the public may view the issue as a strictly partisan exercise along ideological lines. The court has five justices that can reliably be called ""conservative,"" and four justices that can reliably be called ""liberal"" -- terms the justices themselves dispute and refute. But in these health care cases, the breakdown of the rulings may not fall along expected divisions. That unpredictability makes the current Roberts court so fascinating to watch. Finally, the court will not announce beforehand exactly when it hands down the rulings, but the justices are set to end their work for the summer in late June. So between now and then, reporters and interested parties will dutifully show up on scheduled ""opinion days"" and wait for history -- and the discretion of nine independent justices -- to reveal itself.","What specific questions will the Supreme Court address?

"(CNN) -- The New York governor's proposal to decriminalize the public possession of marijuana is drawing high praise from some politicians and police, black and Hispanic activists and backers of pot legalization. ""It is a step in the right direction,"" said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a prominent African-American political activist. But some voices issued warnings about the proposal, with one group, the Drug Free American Foundation, arguing that it is not the time ""to be backing off the marijuana law."" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo unveiled the proposal Monday and said the law would end a double standard that has disproportionately hurt black and Hispanic youth. In 1977, New York's legislature reduced the penalty for possessing 25 grams or less of marijuana to a non-criminal violation carrying a fine of no more than $100 for first-time offenders, as long as the marijuana was in private possession and not in public view. If the marijuana is out and viewable in public -- as it might be when someone is asked to empty his or her pockets during a police ""stop and frisk"" -- it becomes a Class B misdemeanor and can lead to arrests and jail. The ""stop and frisk"" policy allows police to stop and search anyone they deem suspicious. In 2011, more than 50,000 arrests were made for small amounts of marijuana, the governor's office said. Half of those arrested were under 25 years old, and 82% were black or Latino. Less than 10% were ever convicted of a crime. Selling and smoking or burning marijuana is still a crime, and Cuomo is not suggesting changing that. ""If you possess marijuana privately, it is a violation. If you show it in public, it's a crime. It's incongruous. It's inconsistent the way it has been enforced,"" Cuomo said in Albany on Monday. As a result, thousands of young people have wound up ""with a permanent stain on their record for something that would otherwise be a violation. The charge makes it difficult for them to find a job,"" Cuomo said. His proposal won praise from some legislators, police, the Manhattan district attorney and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. But some say the proposal is counterproductive. David G. Evans, special adviser to the Drug Free America Foundation and a criminal defense lawyer in New Jersey, said the group is ""very very concerned with this latest development."" ""This can be seen by the young people as approving the use of marijuana, and they will most likely use marijuana. Marijuana of today is much more addictive and much more potent, and it poses health and criminal problems."" New York State Assemblyman Brian Kolb said he doubts legislators will back the proposal because of ""pushback"" from the community. He argues that marijuana possession is a federal crime, and ""it does not make sense to pass guidelines at the state level that contradicts federal laws."" ""This is a wrong message to send across the country,"" he said. ""This should be a decision at the federal level to be interpreted for all the 50 states."" He said the Food and Drug Administration should make sure the plan follows the proper protocol. ""This is not a states-rights issue. This is a drug issue. In this case, this is a controlled-substance issue,"" he said. But Sharpton, president of the National Action Network, said the proposal would address police abuse. ""We have been convinced, given the data, that Stop and Frisk does not alleviate crime but instead increases the racial profiling exposure of mostly young Blacks and Hispanics,"" he said in a statement. Allen St. Pierre, executive director of the NORML Foundation, which supports legalizing marijuana, said he expects legislators to ""faithfully embrace"" the proposal. He also said the proposal is ""a political no-brainer"" because most Americans will someday back ""marijuana possession in small amounts."" He said Cuomo, who might one day might have presidential aspirations, is positioning himself as the ""marijuana law reformer."" Lester Grinspoon, a psychiatrist, retired professor at Harvard University and expert on drug policy, said Cuomo's move is ""a step on the way of what is inevitable."" ""Adults should be allowed to use marijuana responsibly, in much the way we use alcohol,"" he said. ""It's not just because it's a civil liberties issue. It is very important to furthering marijuana as a medicine."" He said marijuana has been used in the treatment of cancer, multiple sclerosis, AIDS and glaucoma. Robert MacCoun, professor of law and public policy at the University of California at Berkeley, said a dozen states have decriminalized small amounts, usually up to an ounce for a first-time possession, and most of the legal changes took place in the 1970s. An expert on marijuana laws, MacCoun said the ""decriminalization label has mattered less and less"" over time. ""First, the other 38 states have become less and less likely to send convicted marijuana possession felons to prison. Second, states that have 'decriminalized' -- like New York -- still make lots of arrests for marijuana. Few of those arrested will end up in prison, but they may do a short jail stint."" And echoing concerns about the stain of an arrest for marijuana, he said, ""there is a lasting effect on their records, which hurts their employability."" MacCoun said the ""big change"" over the past 10 years ""is the partial legalization of medical marijuana in many states."" ""Recent polls suggest that roughly half of American voters now support some form of legalization; if current trends continue, I think we'll see a state legalize marijuana soon, perhaps even this November. But there will be a thorny conflict with federal laws that prohibit marijuana,"" he said. He points out that medical marijuana or decriminalization can't be confused with ""true legalization."" He called decriminalization a ""sensible reform"" and not a ""risky"" legal change. ""Marijuana possession sanctions have almost no measurable effect on levels of marijuana use. So it is not clear whether any valid purpose is being served by all the marijuana arrests in New York, and people of color are much more likely to be arrested even though they are not more likely to be marijuana users,"" he said. ""Legalization is more complicated, because the steep drop in prices would be difficult to offset with a sustainable tax, and so consumption would probably increase."" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said, ""the human costs to each defendant charged with a misdemeanor are serious."" ""The simple and fair change proposed by Gov. Cuomo will help us redirect significant resources to the most violent criminals and serious crime problems, and, frankly, it is the right thing to do."" The governor's office said 94% of arrests for small amounts of marijuana in the state are in New York City, and Bloomberg, the New York Police Department and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly have come under fire in recent years for the department's ""stop and frisk"" policy. Last year, Kelly issued a policy order directing officers to issue violations, rather than misdemeanors, for small amounts of marijuana discovered during street searches. On Monday, Bloomberg issued a statement in support of Cuomo's comments. ""The governor's proposal today is consistent with the commissioner's directive and strikes the right balance by ensuring that the NYPD will continue to have the tools it needs to maintain public safety -- including making arrests for selling or smoking marijuana,"" he said. ""Thanks to the NYPD, our city has come a long way from the days when marijuana was routinely sold and smoked on our streets without repercussions."" Kelly said Monday, ""I was asked to respond to criticism by some members of the (City) Council that the Police Department was making 'too many' arrests for small amounts of marijuana. And my response to them was, 'Well, your option is to go to Albany and get the law changed.' Better that than having New York City police officers turn a blind eye to the law as it was written, and as it is still written."" And, with the backing of the mayor and the governor, it's hard to fathom any significant opposition to the proposal will arise, said Peter Moscow, an associate professor in the Department of Law and Police Science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. ""It's a positive move,"" he said. CNN's Chris Boyette contributed to this report.","One expert says the move is a step toward the ""inevitable"": legalization .

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- To break out beyond the personal computer market in the U.S., Lenovo Group will need a little help from its friends. Lenovo has operated as a lone wolf in China, where the company is based, by building hardware that runs its uniquely designed software. At the International Consumer Electronics show this week, Lenovo launched a cloud service in China, similar to Apple's iCloud, that will keep all of its devices in sync. The company will take a different approach, however, when it expands in the U.S., Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing said in an interview here. ""We cannot do everything by ourselves,"" Yuanqing said. The U.S. market is ""more challenging than in China because we have to rely on somebody else's ecosystem. So we have to find the right partner here."" Lenovo expects to continue using Microsoft's Windows on its computers, and Google's Android on its tablets and smartphones, Yuanqing said. Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft may try to court the Chinese electronics giant to help with its U.S. mobile efforts, however. In the U.S., Lenovo is barely a top-five PC manufacturer, but it's a solid No. 2 globally. Its trio of tablets, which are all based on Android, haven't sold particularly well in the United States. Lenovo Group has grown significantly in the U.S. in the last few years thanks to its aggressive pricing and the 2005 acquisition of International Business Machines' PC division, which has catapulted Lenovo's sales to corporations. U.S. retailers have suggested that Lenovo should price its computers $50 below competitors' comparable systems, advice the company has heeded because it hasn't achieved a strong brand in America, Yuanqing said. Pinching pennies delays the U.S. expansion because Lenovo can't accumulate enough profit to fund development in other areas like smartphones or TVs, he said. ""The priority for today is to succeed in the PC area,"" Yuanqing said. ""We have invested a lot in this area, and also we have seen hyper-growth in this area. But we have not made money from the consumer PC area. So we cannot afford to invest more in different, other categories."" At Lenovo's CES news conference, Yuanqing discussed ""the four-screen strategy,"" but in the U.S., it only sells two of those screens. Lenovo and Sony, which has long been a proponent of selling multiple devices, define the four primary screens in the consumer electronics world as the PC, smartphone, tablet and television. In the United States, Lenovo only sells computers and tablets. Sony sells all four in many countries and has been deploying software to tie them all seamlessly together. Lenovo will release its fourth screen, a connected TV set, in China. It has gotten some buzz because its software is based on the latest version of Android, heavily modified by Lenovo's programmers, rather than on Google TV. On Lenovo's platforms, Google does not have the ability to control content in the way it does on a Google TV set, like those made by Samsung, Sony and Vizio. Before it brings a TV or phone to the United States, Lenovo will focus on improving its brand through PCs, and on building relationships with U.S. cellular carriers and retailers, Yuanqing said.","Lenovo will not go it alone when it releases smartphones and TVs in the U.S., CEO says .
The company modified the Android mobile software for its TV in China .

"(CNN) -- Four explosions that rocked an eastern Ukrainian city on Friday have prompted a terror probe, the Ukrainian News agency reported. A regional prosecutor's office has started a ""terrorist case"" into the blasts in Dnepropetrovsk. The explosions went off in the course of 70 minutes and injured at least 27. Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych said a special investigation team will be set up to probe the explosions, the news agency reported. ""This is another challenge to the entire country,"" the president told reporters in the country's Crimea region. ""We are thinking how to respond it properly. I am sorry this happened."" The first blast went off in a trash can at a tram stop, injuring 13 people, the country's Emergencies Ministry said. The second followed 40 minutes later near a movie theater. That injured 11, nine of them children. Three were injured in the third blast, and no one was hurt in the fourth, the ministry said. Of those hurt, 24 have been hospitalized, it said. Interior Minister Vitaliy Zakharchenko and other government officials traveled to the city after the blasts occurred. The city, with just over 1 million in population, is one of the largest in the country, the CIA World Factbook says. The incident raises concerns about security in Ukraine ahead of the European soccer championships, starting in June in both Poland and Ukraine. But the Union of European Football Associations, the entity overseeing the games, said the incident doesn't change its ""confidence in the security measures that have been developed by the authorities."" The closest venue to Dnepropetrovsk will be in a Ukrainian city to the east, Donetsk.","NEW: The incident raises concerns in advance of the European soccer championships .

"(CNN) -- Dutch international Wesley Sneijder scored twice as Inter Milan continued their renaissance in Serie A by beating Udinese 3-1, keeping alive the Italian side's chances of European Champions League qualification. Sneijder's brace turned Wednesday's match after Udinese had taken an early lead through Danilo, then midfielder Ricardo Alvarez scored at the end of the first half to all but seal the win for Inter. The result means that the Nerazzurri have been undefeated -- winning three matches and drawing two -- since youth team coach Andrea Stramaccioni replaced Claudio Ranieri earlier this month. Champions League football was but a distant dream for Inter, but 11 points from a possible 15 has left the 2010 European title winners sixth in the table -- just three points off third-placed Lazio, who surprisingly lost 2-1 to relegation-threatened Novara earlier in the day. The unusually timed round of matches took place Wednesday afternoon, a rescheduling of the games canceled as a mark of respect for Livorno's Piermario Morosini, who collapsed and died during a second division game at Pescara. Unbeaten Juventus remained three points clear of defending champions with four matches to play after both teams won narrowly against lowly opposition. Juve, seeking a first Serie A title since 2003 and 28th overall, condemned bottom club Cesena to division two next season thanks to a late goal from striker Marco Borriello -- his first since joining on loan from Roma in January. Borriello's goal came with 11 minutes to play -- and Kevin Prince-Boateng's winner for Milan came even later at home to fourth-bottom Genoa. Napoli, also chasing a Champions League spot, beat Lecce 2-0 to move up to fourth above Udinese -- who will be Sunday's opponents. Roma lost again, this time 2-1 at home to Fiorentina to be two points behind Inter. In the day's two other games Siena drew 1-1 with Bologna while Parma won 2-1 away at Palermo.","Inter Milan beat Udinese 3-1 in Italy's Serie A to stay in hunt for Champions League spot .

"(Mashable)  -- The new-this-year-yet-somehow-already-ubiquitous Facebook Like button has been around just long enough to generate some interesting numbers relating to Facebook users and web traffic. The button, which launched in April at f8, Facebook's developer conference, is now present on roughly 2 million sites around the web, from sports sites to news organizations and many other kinds of publishers. A media analytics lead on Facebook's Developer Network Insights team crunched some numbers and found that Facebook Likes not only generate interesting data about the ""likers"" (a.k.a. Facebook users who are also active on your website) themselves; this data also speaks volumes about clickthrough rates, time on-site and other engagement metrics. Stats about people . On average, a Facebook user who ""likes"" your content has more than double the number of friends than does a typical Facebook user. This could mean the user is more ""social"" or more influential; on the other hand, it could mean the user is an attention-seeking narcissist. While it's fatuous to read too much into that statistic, the number does show that the average ""liker"" is more active from a social-web standpoint. An even more interesting stat about the likers is that they click on five times more links to external sites than the typical Facebook user. If clickthroughs are what you're looking for from your social media strategy, this is good news. Here's a stat just for news sites: The average Facebook user who ""likes"" content on a news website is 34 -- that's about 2 decades younger than the average newspaper subscriber. We've known for some time that the future of journalism and social media are, at this point, inextricably linked; this stat provides a little hard evidence for that conclusion. Stats about traffic . Most website owners are aware that Twitter refers a ton of traffic. It's meant to be a content-referral network, so link-sharing and clickthroughs are a given in many cases. The Facebook ""Like"" button, however, might be bringing Facebook closer to competing with Twitter in the area of referral traffic, though. Since the button launched and was integrated on millions of sites, many publishers are reporting large increases in traffic specifically due to this kind of social plugin. ABC News reported a 190 percent increase; Gawker's traffic shot up by 200 percent; Sporting News said their site traffic was up by a shocking 500 percent; and NBA.com said that Facebook had become their second-largest referral source. Facebook relays messages from publishers saying that these users ""are more engaged and stay longer when their real identity and real friends are driving the experience through social plugins."" As an example, NHL.com reported that pages per user was up by 92 percent, time on-site was up by 85 percent, video-viewing increased by 86 percent more videos and overall visits went up by 36 percent. Clearly, Facebook is only part of social media referral traffic, but it's becoming a larger part as the network grows and users become accustomed to interacting with third-party and external content from within the comfort of their social graph.

"Wheaton, Illinois (CNN) -- Alex Garcia is an Iraq war veteran who feels lucky. He's never needed the homeless shelter where he works. With his easy smile and a boyish face, Iraqi kids took to calling him ""baby"" in the war zone, so much that his superiors in Baghdad had him wear a bandana across his face. After serving from 2004 to 2005 during the height of Iraq's insurgency, Garcia, 25, says he had a relatively stress-free transition back to civilian life. Today, Garcia works at the Midwest Shelter for Homeless Veterans in Wheaton, Illinois, helping others who didn't have such an easy time returning from war. It doesn't happen overnight, he explains, but it is a process to end up with nowhere to call home. ""That's ultimately what it is ... you burn one too many bridges"" Garcia says. He starting working at the shelter in 2008, a year after Vietnam vet Bob ""Doc"" Adams opened it. Adams got the idea  after visiting a similar shelter in Boston, Massachusetts,  in 1997 and thinking, ""Why can't we do that here?"" So 10 years later, with help from other veterans, local unions and a grant from Dupage County, he started the shelter. Adams knows all too well the downward spiral that leads to a life on the streets.  Post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is often the reason many veterans end up without a roof over their heads. One homeless vet's mission . ""It is a destroyer of spirits, it is a destroyer of relationships, it plays havoc on people's employment and it touches every fabric of someone's life,"" Adams said. In Dupage County, recent statistics show that one out of every three people who are homeless are veterans . Since the opening, Adams has helped more than 30 homeless veterans, whose service has spanned from Korea to Afghanistan. While he's happy to help older veterans, Adams started the shelter mainly for younger warriors from Iraq and Afghanistan who appear to have more time on the battlefield than soldiers from his generation. ""The kinds of PTSD symptoms I've seen amongst those veterans is a much more powerful strain than even the ones among my era,"" he says. In addition to small financing from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the shelter is also supported by donations from around northeast Illinois. People donate items such as nonperishable foods and electronics, including a large television for the common area. What you can do to help veterans . The shelter is looking to double its capacity once it opens a new apartment building nearby. Adams feels that inexpensive housing is a pivotal step for veterans trying to transition to civilian life. Texas homebuilder gives homes to injured vets . At the shelter, there is a daily routine designed to mirror military life. For veterans, it is a way to help warriors transition from the streets back into a more self-sustaining life. The rigid program starts in the morning with room inspections, followed by a class on finance management and employment. The instructor leads the the veterans through mock interviews and prepares the students for tough interview questions. During his evening shift, Garcia checks around the shelter to make sure that the assigned duties are accomplished before lights out. He says he hopes to stay on with ""Doc"" Adams because ""it's a moving force that I want to be a part of.""","Alex Garcia, an Iraq war veteran, helps homeless vets at a Chicago-area shelter .

"(CNN) -- Andy Murray and Roger Federer are both carrying the weight of expectation and history into Sunday's men's singles final at Wimbledon. Murray snapped a 74-year streak when he became the first British man to reach the final at the All England Club and will want to end a 76-year long wait for the tennis success starved nation by actually winning a men's grand slam title. The legendary Fred Perry claimed both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open titles in 1936, but since then nothing, despite the brave efforts of Andy Murray's predecessor as British number one, Tiger Henman. Virginia Wade was the last British winner of a grand slam at Wimbledon in 1977, the year of the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. Maybe that will be an omen because 2012 marks the Diamond Jubilee of the British monarch, who made a rare visit to SW19 to see Wade win all those years ago. Wishful thinking . But that sort of historic wishful thinking is unlikely to make much impression on Federer and even Murray admits he needs to play the ""perfect match"" to beat the Swiss maestro. ""He's one of the greatest ever players. He's been doing it consistently over a number of years. He's very, very tough to beat here,"" Murray told gathered reporters after his four-set semifinal win over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France. ""It's a great challenge, one where I'm probably not expected to win, but one that, if I play well, I'm capable of winning. The pressure that I would be feeling if it was against somebody else I guess it would be different. ""But there will be less on me on Sunday because of who he is."" Murray's clever attempt to deflect pressure and focus it on Federer underestimates the expectations of a sports mad country, who have filled just about every seat for every day of every event at the 2012 London Olympics later this month. Britain is likely to come to a standstill Sunday afternoon as television sets are tuned into the live broadcast and in his home town of Dunblane in Scotland special celebrations are planned. Formidable opponent . Murray is right though. Federer is a formidable opponent and can set a string of records if he beats the number four seed and home hope. It will be a record equaling seventh Wimbledon title in the Open Era, drawing level with Pete Sampras, who coincidentally had the same coach, Paul Annacone, as Federer. He will extend his own record to 17 grand slam titles and victory will also take him back to the top of the world rankings, also beating another Sampras record for successive weeks at the top of the men's game. For a 30-year-old, considered to be a waning force, it would be a remarkable performance, made possible by his four-set dismissal of the previously dominant Novak Djokovic to reach a record eighth Wimbledon final. ""There's a lot on the line for me. I'm not denying that. I have a lot of pressure, as well. I'm looking forward to that. That's what I work hard for,"" he said. ""I've worked extremely hard since I lost that match point against Novak last year at the U.S. Open. ""My run has been extremely good. Now I have a chance at world No. 1, and at the title again all at once. ""So it's a big match for me."" Missed chance . Federer missed that chance against Djokovic in the semifinal of the U.S. Open last year, losing a five-set thriller and it looked as if it might be his last with the likes of Rafael Nadal, who made a surprising early exit at Wimbledon, and Murray making it even more difficult to land a grand slam. He would be the first man since Andre Agassi at the Australian Open in 2003 to win one of the top four tournaments in tennis past the age of 30 and only Australian legend Rod Laver and American Arthur Ashe have achieved that feat at Wimbledon. Murray also holds an 8-7 career record over Federer, but the last time the pair met in a grand slam final, at the Australian Open in 2010, he was given a tennis lesson by the man from Basel. But with inspiration and valuable advice from a new coach, eight-time grand slam winner Ivan Lendl, the 25-year Murray may just be ready to bring some much needed cheer to a country in the grip of austerity and in the middle of one of its wettest summers on record.","Andy Murray bidding to become first British man to win grand slam since 1936 .

"(CNN) -- Our understanding of physical reality Ã¢â¬â of everything and nothing Ã¢â¬â has changed forever. We don't yet know where we are heading, but nothing will ever be the same. As a scientist, I don't know what more I could ask for. On July 4, two independent teams of more than 3,000 physicists apiece from more than 40 countries working at the largest particle accelerator on Earth at the European Center for Nuclear Research, or CERN, gathered to announce to the world the discovery of a new elementary particle. This was not just any elementary particle. It was a particle that appears to have all the characteristics of the Higgs boson, which was first predicted by physicists in 1964 and became the most sought-after particle ever since. The Higgs particle is an essential part of the Standard Model of particle physics, one of the most beautiful theories ever created by the human mind. The model provides an eloquent description of almost all of nature as we have observed in experiments in a few equations that can fit on a T-shirt. The only problem was that no experiment had ever provided evidence that the Higgs particle actually exists. News: Higgs boson is like... a Justin Bieber fan? Without the Higgs, the heart of the Standard Model is missing. The Higgs is associated with an invisible field predicted to permeate throughout all of space interacting with particles to give them mass. The Higgs is the key to unlocking the question: Why does matter have mass? Equally importantly, the Higgs allows two of the four forces in nature -- the electromagnetic force and the weak force, which is responsible for most nuclear reactions -- to be unified and described by mathematics of the same type that describe the other two known forces, the so-called strong force and gravity. Quantum mechanics tells us that if such a Higgs field exists, then one can produce real particles out of the field if one throws enough energy into a small enough volume. The discovery of this new particle is notable for what it tells us, but also for what it doesn't. There were some intriguing anomalies in the observation of this Higgslike particle. For example, the rate at which the new particle is produced seems to be slightly higher than the one predicted in the Standard Model. However, this could merely be a statistical fluke that results from the fact that to date only a few score of Higgs candidate events have been observed amongst billions of particle collisions. There are still important unanswered questions about the Standard Model and we have to verify that this remarkable theoretical house of cards can stand on its own. Deviations from the Standard Model prediction, if they are confirmed by more data, can shed light on these unknowns. What is the Higgs boson and why is it important? First and foremost is the question of how the invisible background field tied to the existence of the Higgs came to be and why it has the properties it does. This field is simply posited to exist, and apparently it does. The Higgslike particle takes us a step closer to solving the mystery of the universe, which is inextricably connected to the mystery of our own origin. Likewise, other new physics is now more likely to be uncovered at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, which will add to our knowledge base. We might, for example, find the particles that make up more than 90% of the matter in our galaxy and all galaxies, which look dark to our eyes. And we might be provided with clues that reveal the trail to unraveling the ultimate holy grail of fundamental particle physics -- a quantum theory of gravity. Imagine that the visible universe and everything in it was once contained in a volume many times smaller than the size of a single atom. With a quantum theory of gravity, we may be able to trace the Big Bang expansion back to its very beginning, and understand precisely how our universe arose, presumably from nothing. Read more science news on Light Years . Whatever new door to reality the discovery of Higgs opens for us, the best days may be ahead. That possibility is what energizes us, and makes the continued effort to probe new corners of nature such an exciting part of the human adventure. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lawrence M. Krauss.","Physicists discovered a new particle that appears to be the highly sought after Higgs boson .

"(CNN) -- English Premier League club Liverpool have appointed Brendan Rodgers as their new manager. After being introduced by Liverpool chairman Tom Werner, the 39-year-old Rodgers, who moves to Anfield from Swansea City, revealed that he had insisted that he would not work under a director of football. ""That was something I made clear I couldn't work with,"" said the Northern Irishman. ""What you need is an outstanding team. We will form a technical board that will have four or five people that will decide the way forward."" Rodgers succeeds club legend Kenny Dalglish, who was sacked earlier this month. ""I promise I'll fight for my life and for the people in this city,"" said Rodgers. ""We might not be ready for the title now but the process begins today.,"" he added, a reference to the fact that Liverpool last won the title in 1990. Liverpool have reached an agreement with Swawsea for three members of Rodgers' backroom staff to follow him to Anfield. The Northern Irish coach led Welsh team Swansea into the Premier League in 2011 and impressed pundits with their fluent passing style as they finished 11th in their first season. Liverpool have been on the hunt for a new manager after sacking Dalglish following a disappointing season, in which they achieved their lowest ever Premier League finish. The club did win the League Cup but were beaten in the FA Cup final by Chelsea, prompting American owners Fenway Sports Group, who also own baseball's Boston Red Sox, to act. The Merseyside outfit had also spoken to Wigan manager Roberto Martinez about the managerial vacancy before settling on Rodgers. The 39-year-old began his coaching career at Chelsea, under the stewardship of Jose Mourinho, who led the club to successive Premier League titles in 2005 and 2006 and now coaches Spanish giants Real Madrid. Rodgers spent a season in charge at Watford, in the second tier of English football, before moving to Reading in 2009, but he only lasted six months before he was sacked. He took over at Swansea in 2010 and led the club into the Premier League at the first time of asking after a win in the playoff final against former club Reading. Swansea quickly grew into life in the top flight and gained a clutch of notable scalps. They beat Premier League champions Manchester City, Arsenal and, ironically, Liverpool on the final day of the season. Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins said: ""Although we are very disappointed to lose such a talented, young British manager, we didn't wish to stand in his way. As always at Swansea City, we want people working here who are fully committed to the task ahead. ""We wish Brendan every success in the future. We will always remain good friends and we thank him for all his hard work and passion at this football club over the past two years. ""We shall now refocus and quickly start the process of finding his replacement to continue the great work Brendan has carried out at this football club."" Meanwhile, Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson has been drafted into England's Euro 2012 squad after Frank Lampard was forced to withdraw with a thigh injury. The 21-year-old made 37 Premier League appearances for Liverpool last season, after joining the club from Sunderland in June 2011. Henderson will be hoping to add to the two international caps he has gained so far in his career.","English Premier League club Liverpool appoint Brendan Rodgers as manager .

"(CNN) -- Miguel Cotto says he will beat Floyd Mayweather -- ""no doubt"" -- but don't expect him to dance around the gym, making it rain and running his mouth about it. It's not how he rolls. Unlike his opponent in Saturday's WBA super-welterweight title fight, Cotto doesn't resort to third-person, braggadocio-packed soliloquies when a reporter asks a question. ""I'm ready and prepared for anything he can bring to me the night of May 5,"" Cotto said of Mayweather. Period. That's it. Cotto has trained his trunks off and all the Mayweather jawing in the world can't get into his head. ""Those guys can't penetrate our minds,"" he said. HBO, which is airing the fight on pay-per-view, has used its prefight coverage to paint the men as entirely different species ahead of their bout in Las Vegas. It's Puerto Rican vs. African-American, inconspicuous vs. flamboyant, custom Freightliner vs. Rolls Royce, wife and kids vs. 50 Cent. And if not for a segment showing Mayweather running a 5K for charity and cutting a six-figure check to Habitat for Humanity, good vs. evil. And let's not forget their purses: A reported $8 million for Cotto and $35 million for the man appropriately known as Money. Where Cotto says he doesn't want to dictate how history remembers him, Mayweather demands to author his own legacy. When HBO's third installment of the behind-the-scenes ""24/7"" aired last week, Mayweather tweeted that he didn't like it, apologized to fans and called for HBO to replace the producer. Even the fighters' styles are at odds, with Cotto employing a more aggressive technique that can resemble brawling when his opponent forces it. Mayweather prefers to size up his opponent and rely on footwork, defense, counterpunching and Joe Louis-like accuracy. Max Kellerman, a boxing analyst and commentator for HBO, which like CNN is owned by Time Warner, said their styles have evolved in recent years and he sees Mayweather today as a ""consistent, thudding puncher"" who relies less on the ropes and the ring's perimeter and more on a high guard and his ability to ""walk down"" or pressure his opponent. Cotto, on the other hand, is not the all-out brawler he's sometimes made out to be. He's a deft puncher and he's aggressive, but don't expect him to go blow for blow with Mayweather. ""He's looking to inflict damage, but he's not like a wild, face-first brawler,"" Kellerman said. Former four-division champ Roy Jones Jr. said he wouldn't be surprised to see Mayweather chase Cotto around the ring. He said that if Cotto is to win against a smaller, quicker Mayweather, he is going to have to ""change the game,"" something he hasn't seen Cotto do since his 2007 WBA welterweight title bout with ""Sugar"" Shane Mosley. In that fight, Cotto used his jab to neutralize Mosley's speed. He moved around a lot so Mosley couldn't settle down, and he took a lot of punches (248, to be exact) to set up his own attack. He'll need to do the same with Mayweather to slow him down and change the fight's rhythm. Cotto will also need to take some punches, something Jones isn't sure he's ready to do. ""They're not the most devastating punches, but at the same time, (Cotto's) still got to take them,"" he said, adding with skepticism, ""He's not going to stay and take no punches to get his attack in."" Jones was also concerned about some of the statements coming from Mayweather, a notorious prefight smack talker. In a recent appearance on Kellerman's HBO show, Mayweather called Cotto ""solid"" and ""one of the best fighters out there."" He went on to say he viewed Cotto as ""an undefeated fighter."" ""You don't hear him talk like that till after the fight,"" Jones said, speculating that Mayweather may feel Cotto lacks confidence or can be easily outclassed. ""That bothers me."" Cotto has lost twice in his professional career, once against eight-division champion Manny Pacquiao, in which Pacquiao made Cotto drop weight, and another against Antonio Margarito, who was suspended for a year after a subsequent fight against Mosley when officials found plaster in his hand wraps. Those circumstances are what prompted Mayweather's remark that Cotto was undefeated. Many in the boxing world, including Cotto and Jones, believe Margarito cheated when he fought Cotto the first time in 2008. Cotto, who defeated Margarito in last year's rematch, said his evidence was simple: ""All the swelling in my face in the first fight did not even compare with how good, how healthy I looked on December 3."" Cotto himself blew off Mayweather's ""undefeated"" remark, saying the losses made him a more mature fighter. ""If it weren't for those defeats, I wouldn't be this person,"" he said. The reigning WBA super-welterweight superchamp also dismissed comparisons of his and Mayweather's performances against common opponents. The pair have each fought Mosley, Zab Judah, Victoriano Sosa, Justin Juuko and DeMarcus Corley. They earned unanimous decisions against Mosley, and Cotto won by technical knockout in the other four fights. Mayweather knocked out only Juuko, winning by unanimous decision in the other three. On their face, those outcomes would seem to favor Cotto, but the pugilist flatly stated, ""Every fight's different ... The fighters we have in common doesn't mean anything."" It's an assertion with which Jones and Kellerman concurred. Despite Mayweather being a heavy favorite, Cotto's close friend and manager, Bryan Perez, told Fight Hype last month that Team Cotto had devised a ""blueprint"" for beating Mayweather and that he hadn't seen Cotto this motivated in ""many, many fights."" ""I trained a lot. I make my training the right training to beat Mayweather,"" Cotto added Tuesday. Cotto will need something special if he's to hand Mayweather his first loss, Kellerman said. Unlike many champs before him, Mayweather never takes an opponent lightly, and ""he has never shown up in less than top-notch condition."" Despite the sideshows surrounding Mayweather, which include a domestic violence plea that will land him in jail for 90 days beginning next month, the Money Team's mantra has always been ""hard work and dedication,"" and it pays off, Kellerman said. The analyst pointed to the once-invincible Mike Tyson, who successfully defended his heavyweight title only nine times before James ""Buster"" Douglas, a 42-to-1 underdog, clocked him in the 10th round, leaving Iron Mike scrounging for his mouthpiece. Former middleweight champ ""Marvelous"" Marvin Hagler said it best, according to Kellerman: ""It isn't easy to get up at 6:30 on a bitterly cold morning for road work when you're wearing silk pajamas."" Kellerman said he expects a good fight. He felt the odds of a Cotto win, which reached as high as 7-to-1 (they were 9-to-2 as of Friday morning), were a little long but that ""Mayweather is correctly the substantial favorite."" Jones had less confidence in Cotto's chances, especially if he doesn't alter his technique. He predicted it will be a close fight for about five rounds before Mayweather starts wearing his opponent down. Cotto, of course, doesn't care what the bookmakers or commentators think. He's known he was the underdog since he began training in March, and he's unfazed, he said. ""I'm going for victory,"" he said. ""I have no doubt I'm going to be the winner.""","Match will pit aggressive Miguel Cotto against fleet-footed Floyd Mayweather .

"(Rolling Stone) -- The Rolling Stones are strongly considering at least one live concert later this year to mark their 50th anniversary, Stones insiders tell Rolling Stone. Sources add that the band is still considering a tour in 2013. ""I'd like to get a couple of shows down and see how it goes,"" Keith Richards says. ""But I'd love it."" The news comes after the band gathered in late April in the New York area for a full week of rehearsals -- their first time playing together at such length since the final night of the marathon A Bigger Bang tour at London's O2 arena in August 2007. In July, the band will gather in London to further discuss live performance possibilities. ""It's all very hush-hush,"" Richards says. ""I'm going over to London for a bit, so I'll find out more then."" He adds that the band will also use the summit to discuss whether they will be recording their first new LP since 2005's A Bigger Bang. ""We're going to talk about that in July and see. I mean, I'd love to get some tracks down and see what songs we've got. And that goes along with part of getting the band back together and getting things moving. So I'd love to cut some tracks, yeah."" Does Richards see himself writing one-on-one with Mick Jagger again? ""Oh, yeah,"" he says. ""I have no doubt."" In late April, the Stones began rehearsing in New York and continued working across the Hudson River in Weehawken, New Jersey, inviting a film crew led by director Brett Morgen to shoot footage for a documentary celebrating the group's anniversary, set for a fall release. The Stones blasted through classics including ""Beast of Burden,"" ""Respectable,"" ""Fool to Cry"" and ""Gimme Shelter."" ""We played everything, really,"" says Richards. ""We're just getting our chops together. It was like playing in the garage Ã¢â¬â a maintenance check, you know?"" The vibe was joyful, with Keith Richards and Mick Jagger joking around between takes. ""Someone would mention a song, and within the second run, they had nailed it,"" Morgen says. ""Having screened through 50 years of material over the last six months, I would rank it up there with anything I've ever heard from them. They were extremely tight."" Adds Richards, ""I thought I'd be quite rusty. After all, we hadn't done it for a while Ã¢â¬â five years or something. But it sounded as fresh as you could hope for. It was a great week.""

"Warsaw, Poland (CNN) -- European football's governing body took a tough line against soccer-related disorder Wednesday, as it imposed a penalty on Russia for ""improper conduct"" by its fans at the Euro 2012 tournament. The ruling by UEFA relates to the opening game of the tournament in Wroclaw, Poland, on Friday. Its officials are still considering what action to take over allegations of racist abuse by Russian fans at the same game, and violence before and after a Euro 2012 game in Warsaw on Tuesday. Police detained 184 people after clashes broke out in the Polish capital before and after the Poland-Russia game, which ended in a 1-1 draw. Interior Minister Jacek Cichocki told reporters that more arrests could come. ""Police officers continue to watch recordings from CCTV and police cameras to identify other hooligans who disturbed public order,"" he said. The suspended six-point deduction imposed on Russia by UEFA will apply to the qualifying campaign for the Euro 2016 tournament, rather than the current one. Russia's national football body was also fined 120,000 euros ($150,000), UEFA said. It has three days to appeal the decision. The penalty is in response to ""crowd disturbances, the setting off and throwing of fireworks and the display of illicit banners,"" UEFA said. ""The ruling does not take into account the alleged racist abuse of Czech defender Theodor Gebre Selassie by Russia fans during the same game or incidents of crowd violence before the game against Poland on Monday. Both incidents are currently being investigated by UEFA and could result in further penalties being handed out."" Russian football expert James Appell told CNN the penalty showed UEFA was taking Russian fans' behavior ""very, very seriously."" UEFA earlier condemned what it called ""isolated incidents"" before and after Tuesday's game in Warsaw ""when some groups of known troublemakers pelted the police with missiles and attacked fans irrespective of the team they were supporting."" The body said its focus was to ensure that genuine football fans were able to enjoy the games peacefully, while isolating the handful who wanted to cause trouble. It is determined that the ""overwhelmingly peaceful and festive atmosphere"" that has so far prevailed will continue through the final on July 1, it said Wednesday. Cichocki said Tuesday's violence had been the biggest public order challenge so far of the tournament -- which Poland is co-hosting with Ukraine -- but he praised police efforts. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk dismissed those who tried to disrupt the match as ""fools,"" according to public broadcaster Polish Radio's press agency. Law enforcement officials will be ruthless in suppressing the kind of ""limited"" trouble seen so far, he is quoted as saying. Joanna Mucha, Poland's sports minister, told reporters she was appalled by the violence in Warsaw. ""I feel ashamed for those who came not to enjoy sport, but to cause trouble,"" she said. ""They are hooligans, they aren't even fans -- certainly not fans wanting to support Poland. They will face charges and we will not let them ruin this celebration for us."" Russian supporters had organized a march through Warsaw before the match Tuesday evening to mark Russia's June 12 national day. The disorder broke out as about 5,000 Russian fans reached Warsaw's Poniatowski Bridge, on their way to the National Stadium, the Interior Ministry said in a statement, with ""hooligans"" from both sides seeking to start a fight. More than 5,600 police officers were on duty in Warsaw, and riot police took ""decisive"" action to stop the violence from escalating, it said. Ten police officers were injured in the violence and received medical treatment. The 184 suspects detained include more than 150 Poles, more than 20 Russians, a Hungarian, a Spaniard and a citizen of Algeria, the statement said. Some of those arrested had dangerous objects with them, including brass knuckles and clubs, as well as mouth guards. Those responsible for violence can expect swift justice, the Interior Ministry statement said. ""The hooligans will be sentenced by the end of the week. In the case of foreigners involved in the incidents, speeded-up penal proceedings will be instituted,"" it said. Those from outside the European Union's Schengen passport-free area will be deported and will receive a ban on entry to the European Union, the statement said. Their visas will also be withdrawn. Polish journalist Michal Pol, who was there when the clashes on the bridge broke out, told CNN that the Russian supporters had been moving peacefully toward the stadium when ""very aggressive Polish hooligans"" provoked them. Then, out of the middle of the Russian fans, came a number of ""hooded and very well trained young guys who knew exactly who they wanted to fight"" among the Poles, he said. Russian media focused on the role of Polish fans and police in their reports Wednesday. A headline on state news agency Itar-Tass reads, ""Russian Football Union hopes Polish police will defend guests."" The president of the Russian Football Union, Sergei Fursenko, is quoted as saying that ""well-trained groups attacked the Russian fans,"" who he says were behaving perfectly correctly and should have been protected by Polish authorities. However, Appell, the football analyst, said Russia has a poor track record when it comes to soccer-related violence. Questions should be asked about why 5,000 of its fans were allowed to march through Warsaw in what could be considered a provocative act, given the long and troubled history between Russia and Poland, he said. However, when Russia hosts the 2018 World Cup, it is likely to organize it to a ""micro level,"" he said, in order to avoid similar issues with fan violence. Russian state-run broadcaster RT reported that Polish police fired warning shots and used water cannons and tear gas as they sought to break up the clashes in Warsaw. Mikolaj Piotrowski, director of communications for Poland 2012, told CNN he felt ""anger and shame"" that a small group of ""hooligans"" were trying to spoil the tournament for Poland's 37 million citizens and their visitors. ""I was really, really angry but we must be aware of the scale -- almost 200 persons were taken under custody by Polish police and at the same time, almost 200,000 people were having fun here in Warsaw,"" he said. He defended the policing of the game, saying officers did a good job in closing down the disorder when it kicked off, and said Poland would continue its ""zero tolerance"" policy on fan violence through Euro 2012 and beyond. Everyone is determined there will be no repeat of the violence seen Tuesday, he said. Authorities stress that the vast majority of football fans in Ukraine and Poland have supported their sides peacefully. In the course of Tuesday, about 150,000 fans visited the Warsaw ""fan zone,"" an area away from the stadium where games are shown on big screens for those without tickets, Poland's Interior Ministry said. Tens of thousands of more fans watched the Greece-Czech Republic game, played in Wroclaw, from that city's stadium and fan zone, it said. Altogether, more than a million supporters have flocked to stadiums and fan zones in Poland since Euro 2012 kicked off Friday, it said. However, Russian officials had already called for better behavior from the country's supporters after the unrest during Friday's opening 4-1 win against the Czech Republic team. ""Those who choose the sports arena for the declaration of their personal political and other positions have no place in the stands,"" read a statement on the Russian Football Union's website Monday. ""The Russian Football Union and the national team of Russia kindly request all the fans of these provocative actions to confront bullies and to cooperate fully with the organizers of the match in matters of security. ""We appeal to all fans who are in Poland. Remember that you represent your country. Respect yourself, your home and your team.""

"London (CNN) -- You could call it the humanoid robot's more curvacious cousin. Slithering into confined spaces, tackling tasks too difficult or dangerous for humans, the Snake-arm robot can ""reach the unreachable"" say its UK inventors, OC Robotics. Managing director Rob Buckingham and technical director Andrew Graham developed their first prototype in 2001 from their base in Bristol, England, and they've been perfecting the technology ever since. Today, with clients in the nuclear sector and others queuing up for a demonstration, the hard work is beginning to pay off. The technical challenge has been finding a way to channel energy into the snake-arm, Buckingham says. ""Just like the human arm, the big muscles that drive them are actually mounted on the back and tendons link the muscles to the joints,"" Buckingham said. ""Basically, we've taken that principle to an extreme and use wire ropes as tendons and all the motors (actuators) that control the arm are at the base of the robot,"" he added. Made of steel, these ""wire ropes"" transfer the actuators' mechanical power into the snake-arm, where a series of articulating links create a sinuous movement. They can be made to various lengths, but the width is crucial to the robot's functional efficiency. ""Our rule of thumb is 30 to one (a length 30 times the diameter) is good for a robot that can do quite a lot of work,"" Buckingham said. The arms themselves are delivery mechanisms, Buckingham says, for a range of tools which can be fitted to the tip. Video cameras, lights, tack welding, cutting, gripping and swabbing gear are just a few of the tools OC Robotics has built, and all can be routed through the snake-arm's hollow core. Both the arm and the tools are controlled by a human operator who uses nothing more complicated than a computer screen and a control pad borrowed from a video games console. Test your skills on the Snake-Arm Simulator . ""You're not removing the person completely, but they are working much more safely. That's what we've seen in the nuclear sector,"" Buckingham said. In 2004, OC carried out a complex maintenance job on a reactor in Sweden and last year, it successfully inspected a reactor in Ontario, Canada. ""It's getting to the stage where our technology is quite mature,"" Buckingham said, ""and we're looking for partners and customers who will actually grab hold of the opportunity."" His wishes may soon be granted. Earlier this year the company demonstrated a 2.5 meter snake-arm fitted with swabbing, scooping and radiological probe tools to Sellafield, the UK's primary nuclear decommissioning company. ""I have to admit that when I went down to see it I was a lot more impressed than I expected to be,"" said Phil Reeve, head of strategy and technical for Sellafield's decommissioning directorate. ""We have places which ideally we don't want to put people into and we don't want to make big openings either -- we have situations where we want to know what is on the other side of a four-feet concrete wall,"" Reeve said. ""If we've got something that can go in and is sufficiently dextrous to maneuver around obstacles and can get out again then it potentially has some big advantages,"" he added. The savings could run into millions of dollars, Reeve believes, but clearly there are more important things at stake. ""If we can reduce the number of times that somebody has to put on a plastic suit in hazardous environments then there's a huge benefit in that which goes beyond (money),"" Reeve said. Buckingham is hopeful the company can help with the cleanup operation at the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan. An offer has been made he says, but as yet, no reply has been received. In the meantime, other industrial partners are being sought. Aviation giants Airbus and Boeing are looking at how the technology might aid inspection of the confined spaces inside wings and fuselages during the manufacturing process. Demonstrations have also been requested by both U.S. and UK government defense agencies into how the snake-arm could enhance remote vehicle inspection. Doctors and patients may also be beneficiaries in the future too as OC Robotics works on a snake-arm which could one day perform natural orifice surgery. ""Our prototype signals a direction of travel and is a milestone towards exploring a new surgical paradigm,"" Buckingham said.","Snake-arm robot aims to ""reach the unreachable"" according to UK creators .

"(CNN) -- As health officials continued their investigation into what role a bacterial infection may have had in the deaths of nine hospital patients and the infection of 10 others in six Alabama hospitals, one official acknowledged that they may never find out. ""We don't know, and may never know, if the Serratia marcescens bloodstream infection played a role in the deaths of these patients,"" Dr. Elizabeth D. Ennis, chief medical officer of the Baptist Health System, said Tuesday in a statement. She was referring to the infection caused by rod-shaped bacteria that were discovered in bags used in intravenous feeding -- also referred to as total parenteral nutrition. The infection would have entered the bloodstream easily and ""with a pretty quick effect in terms of blood pressure and temperature,"" said Dr. Donald Williamson of the Alabama Department of Public Health in a conference call Tuesday night with reporters. But the products no longer pose a threat to anyone who has not already been identified, he added. It was not clear how many people in all had been administered the solution, he said. The infected IV bags have been removed from the hospitals and the product has been recalled, he said. ""For the pharmacy and these patients, this is now a closed loop,"" he said. ""The bigger challenge is how did this happen, and what can be done to reduce the risk of contamination in the future."" The nutrition product, which was recalled last Thursday, was made by Birmingham, Alabama-based Meds IV, which did not respond to phone calls left Tuesday and Wednesday; its website was offline on Wednesday. Of the five patients at Shelby Baptist Medical Center who were infected, two died; of the seven infected at Princeton Baptist Medical Center, four died, Ennis said. Of two cases at Select Specialty Hospital, one died; of three cases at Medical West Hospital, one died; the one case at Baptist Prattville proved fatal, but the one case at Cooper Green Hospital did not die, said Dr. Jim McVay, director of healthy promotion and chronic disease for the Alabama Health Department.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Nearly five years to the day after a Turkish-Armenian newspaper editor was gunned down in broad daylight, a judge acquitted all 19 defendants in his trial of charges that they were members of an ""armed terrorist organization."" One defendant, Yasin Hayal, received a life sentence for conspiring in the planned killing of Hrant Dink, editor-in-chief of the Armenian-language newspaper ""Agos."" Prosecutors accused Hayal of purchasing the murder weapon, a 7.65 millimeter Turkish-produced handgun. Hayal was also accused of recruiting a 17-year old soccer player named Ogun Samast to use the gun to kill Dink. Another defendant, Erhan Tuncel, was cleared of charges in connection to the murder. Instead, he was sentenced to more than 10 years in prison for the 2004 bombing of a McDonald's restaurant in the Black Sea city of Trabzon. Attorneys for the Dink family denounced the sentences, arguing it downgraded a politically motivated assassination to the level of a common criminal murder. ""This decision was unexpected,"" lawyer Fethiye Cetin told journalists outside the courthouse. Standing next to Dink's widow, Rakel, Cetin called the trial a ""comedy."" ""The tradition of the state of political murders and the tradition of the state to make enemies of some of its citizens by classifying them as 'others,' this tradition continues,"" Cetin continued. ""This was was an opportunity for democratization in Turkey, but they did not seize that opportunity."" Dink was gunned down on the sidewalk outside the Istanbul office of the Agos newspaper in 2007. Surveillance cameras caught the convicted murderer, Samast, fleeing the scene wearing a white hat. The confessed killer was later sentenced to more than 22 years in prison. He received a lighter sentence because he was a minor. At the time of the murder, Dink was defending himself in court against a number of cases accusing him of ""insulting Turkish identity,"" for comments made about the massacre of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Armenians in the final days of the Ottoman Empire. Dink argued the killings amounted to genocide, a term the Turkish state continues to vehemently deny. In 2010, the European Court of Human rights fined Turkey more than $100,000 for failing to ""protect the life and freedom of expression"" of Dink. In interviews before his murder, Dink said he had received death threats for his outspoken opinions. Investigative journalist Nedim Sener later wrote in a book that Istanbul police were aware of threats to Dink's life. Sener is currently in prison, facing charges of plotting to overthrow the Turkish government. ""The Turkish authorities have failed to address state officials' alleged involvement in the killing of journalist and human rights activist Hrant Dink,"" Amnesty International wrote this week. ""The security services knew of the murder plot and were in communication with those accused of the murder yet nothing was done to stop it taking place... Nothing short of a full investigation into the actions of all the state institutions and officials implicated in the murder will represent justice."" After Tuesday's court ruling, Dink's family and attorneys, along with several hundred supporters, marched in protest through the streets of Istanbul in sub-zero temperatures carrying signs saying ""We are all Armenian.""","Some of the defendants were earlier convicted of conspiracy and murder .

"(CNN) -- Archaeologists are reveling in the discovery of an ancient synagogue in northern Israel, a ""monumental"" structure with a mosaic floor depicting the biblical figure of Samson and a Hebrew inscription. The synagogue -- dating to the fourth and fifth centuries in both the Talmudic and late Roman periods -- is in Huqoq, an ancient Jewish village in the country's Galilee region, the Israeli Antiquities Authority said. Jodi Magness, a professor of early Judaism in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said the building was found in a recent excavation. She called the find ""exciting"" and described the ""very high quality of the artwork"" in the mosaic, crafted with ""tiny colored stone cubes."" Only a few late Roman period synagogues contained mosaics with biblical scenes, said Magness, one of the leaders of a U.S., Israeli and Canadian team engaged in the digs. ""This discovery is significant,"" she said, calling the site ""extraordinary"" and ""stunning."" Samson was known for enormous physical strength and his fighting prowess against the Philistines, the enemy of the Israelites. His story, recounted in the Bible's Book of Judges, mentions Delilah, a Philistine woman who worked to undermine Samson. She cut his hair after she persuaded Samson to reveal that his long hair was the secret to this strength. Magness said the mosaic scene shows Samson putting torches between the tails of foxes. That image, from a vignette in the Book of Judges, is a reference to Samson exacting revenge on the Philistines by sending out flame-laden foxes to burn their lands. She said the only other images of Samson in synagogues are at one nearby place in the Galilee known as Wadi Hamam, where Samson is seen ""smiting"" the Philistines with the jawbone of an ass. Another is in what is now modern Turkey, depicting scenes from Samson's life. Samson is also depicted in early Christian art, she said. Why is Samson portrayed and apparently revered in two synagogues close to each other? Magness said she plans to find out. The other image contains two apparently female faces flanking a circular medallion. It has a Hebrew inscription referring to rewards for carrying out good deeds. ""Our mosaics are also important because of their high artistic quality and the tiny size of the mosaic cubes. This, together with the monumental size of the stones used to construct the synagogue's walls, suggest a high level of prosperity in this village, as the building clearly was very costly,"" the authority said in its statement, citing Magness.","The ancient synagogue is in Israel's Galilee region .

"(CNN) -- In recent days, we have again found our national attention turned to a handful of images someone has brought back from Afghanistan, this time showing American soldiers ""posing with insurgents' body parts,"" in the words of a typical commentary. The report is tinged, as always, with tones of shame and reproach. Reflexively, our gaze turns inward and the chapel bells of moral outrage are once again rung. A vague shroud of nobility is draped on the term ""insurgents,"" as if they were daring mountain climbers or intrepid explorers. The 99% of American households with no attachment to our military shake their collective heads and wonder at such repugnant developments, How could our boys? Well, I'll tell you. They're in a war, as cruel and nasty as any war is. They are suffering and bleeding in ways that those of you who have never been there will ever understand. They deal every day with an adversary who is not noble by any stretch. He is a skulking murderer who does nothing braver than wait, watch and press a command detonator that destroys in one violent instant young American lives and limbs. Here is what that slinking, crouching, hiding enemy brings them, in the words of a young Navy surgeon writing anonymously on deadspin.com last month: . Opinion: Why are we still in 'Vietghanistan?' ""One Marine from my unit lost both legs high on the femur in an instant, and the blast opened his pelvis. Marines and a corpsman were at his side in seconds, and knew where to find his arteries to stop the bleeding from his gaping groin. His circulatory system no longer circulated Ã¢â¬â his arteries and veins were a nest of open-ended tubes draining away from his heart. The team at Camp Bastion stabilized his injuries, and in the process gave him more than 100 units of blood. Twenty citizens' worth of blood went into him and flowed out his wounds again before he was stable."" That is what your soldiers and Marines, the ones you sent to that backward, violent place, live and die with. And consequently, on those rare occasions when they can corner the craven shadow dwellers who have been inflicting such dreadful, random, merciless death and dismemberment, they kill them. Gratefully. Enthusiastically. Passionately. In repayment for what has been suffered on your behalf. In expiation of the terrible burden of having watched helplessly as comrades are killed and maimed in the most awful ways that you in your living rooms can't even begin to imagine. So if they are caught in some primitive dance of celebration over the dead bodies of their tormenters, catch them up short. Tell them it is undignified, undisciplined and bad counterinsurgency. But don't demonize them or lionize their enemy. Before you condemn their character, step back and reflect on the fact that you sent them there. They went instead of your own son or daughter, from whom they are no different. Ask yourself whatever could make our young men act that way. And finally, accept that you don't know the answer, because you have never been there. To know that, and still claim the right to sit in judgment, is a betrayal as profound as anything that happens in war. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rod Smith.","Those who have not been to war cannot judge the actions of those who have, Smith says .
Soldiers who posed with bodies should be reproached but not demonized, he says .

"(CNN) -- What started out as Chelsea's worst season since owner Roman Abramovich arrived in 2003 is now on the verge of becoming one of the English club's best. Saturday's FA Cup final success, the London side's fourth in six years in the world's oldest football competition, is the latest step in a revival that could end in the realization of the Russian billionaire's longheld dream. The nailbiting 2-1 victory at Wembley is but a tasty precursor to a Champions League final in Munich on May 19 that offers the chance for Abramovich to finally win Europe's top club prize. He brought Premier League success to Stamford Bridge in 2005 after spending millions on coach Jose Mourinho and a swathe of star players, achieving Chelsea's first English title in 50 years. Two more followed, but not before Mourinho departed after failing to repeat the European triumph at Porto that earned Abramovich's attention -- and Avram Grant, Luiz Felipe Scolari and Carlo Ancelotti also exited as Champions League success proved elusive. Andre Villas-Boas, ""the new Mourinho,"" was bought out of his contract at Porto to replace Ancelotti -- a European champion as both player and coach -- but the Portuguese prodigy alienated Chelsea's powerful old guard of players as he sought to stamp his authority and rebuild the squad. His assistant Roberto di Matteo, a former Chelsea player himself, has had no such problems winning their respect as he has reverted to the style so successful under Mourinho, allowing the likes of veterans Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba to restore their pre-eminent roles in the team. Drogba scored the vital winner in the first leg of the remarkable Champions League semifinal success against arguably the world's best team, Barcelona, and he netted the ultimately decisive second goal against Liverpool. The 34-year-old Ivory Coast captain is now the only player to score in four FA Cup finals, equaling the five goals in total scored by legendary Liverpool striker Ian Rush in three title matches. Drogba may yet make his Chelsea exit after the Bayern Munich clash in two weeks' time -- a match which not only holds the key to Abramovich's hopes, but could also be part of a solution to the challenges the club faces under European soccer's new financial fair play rules. Each team will get a reported $66 million for making the final, when television money is added to the prize total on offer, representing a major budgetary boost for a club like Chelsea -- which under the new regulations can no longer rely on Abramovich's deep pockets. Chelsea's bid to become more financially self-sufficient took another step ahead of Saturday's final, with news the club is seeking to buy the nearby iconic Battersea power station and turn it into a new home ground with capacity greater than the present one. The $2.9 million earned by winning the FA Cup final for the seventh time will also help, as well as furthering the prospects of Di Matteo being made Chelsea's permanent manager. Brazil midfielder Ramires followed up his second-leg goal against Barcelona with the opening strike in the 11th minute as he beat goalkeeper Pepe Reina at the near post with a low shot. Drogba doubled the lead seven minutes after halftime, but Liverpool substitute Andy Carroll ensured a nervy finish after reducing the deficit on 64. The striker -- who has struggled since joining Liverpool for a club-record $50 million fee in January 2011 after Fernando Torres left for Chelsea for $30 million more than that -- thought he had leveled the scores with a late header. However, Chelsea keeper Petr Cech clawed the ball clear off the underside of the crossbar apparently before it had crossed the line -- much to the disgust of Liverpool striker Luis Suarez, who was booked for remonstrating with the line official. ""We've been heavily criticised this season and we've got a trophy and we've got the chance for another,"" said Di Matteo, who scored in two FA Cup final wins for Chelsea in 1997 and 2000. ""This group of players have made the club proud. It's been hard work, but we came through it."" Liverpool will play in Europe next season, albeit the second-tier Europa League after winning the League Cup in February, but it has been an otherwise disappointing season under manager Kenny Dalglish. The 18-time English champions trail sixth-placed Chelsea by 12 points with two games to play in the Premier League, a situation which cannot please the club's American owners -- who are looking to emulate the success they have had with baseball's Boston Red Sox. ""They were better than us for the first hour,"" Dalglish said after the final. ""We finished really strong and if we'd started the way we'd finished we'd maybe have been happier than we are now. We've just got to learn the lessons."" Abramovich's hopes of Champions League football next season, meanwhile, appear to rest solely on victory in Munich, despite a slip-up by third-placed London rivals Arsenal on Saturday. Arsenal's 3-3 draw with Norwich gave Tottenham and Newcastle the chance to move up to third and fourth with victories on Sunday. Spurs, who hold the edge on goal difference only, face relegation-threatened Aston Villa while the in-form Magpies will seek to follow up Wednesday's 2-0 win over Chelsea with another result against league leaders Manchester City. Both clubs are five points clear of Chelsea, but know that the fourth-placed team will be bumped down to the Europa League if Abramovich gets what he really wants in Germany. City returned to the top on goal difference with a 1-0 win in Monday's Manchester derby, but second-placed local rivals United have easier opposition on Sunday as the defending champions host mid-table Swansea.","Chelsea win English FA Cup for the seventh time, beating Liverpool 2-1 in Saturday's final .

"(CNN) -- After their heroics last Monday against hated city rivals Manchester United, Manchester City went one step closer to securing their first league title in four decades after beating Newcastle United 2-0. Both second half goals came from Yaya Toure against a Newcastle side desperate for victory in a bid to secure third place, and with it a place in Europe's Champions League, the world's richest club competition. When the full time whistle was blown grown men wept in the stands as City's players celebrated knowing that, barring a miracle, this was going to be their year. Those fans have witnessed a remarkable phoenix-like rise from the ashes. Once the blue half of Manchester was the bigger of the two city teams. City once even relegated Manchester United on the last day of the 1973-1974 season. But whilst United went on to dominate the Premier League era, in 1996 Manchester City were relegated from the Premier League. Two years later they were relegated again, this time in to the third tier of English football. That proved to be rock bottom as City eventually fought their way back to become Premier League regulars. It was the purchase of the club in 2008 by the royal family of Abu Dhabi that transformed City from an average team with a glorious past into the richest football club in the world. Hundreds of millions of dollars was spent on players like Toure, secured from Barcelona, Sergio Aguero and Carlos Tevez. Before the game both Manchester teams were on 83 points, with City ahead on goal difference, the closest title race in Premier League history. And it looked like Newcastle United was about to hand Manchester United advantage in the title fight as coach Alan Pardew's side held City at bay for the first 70 minutes. The match turned on a piece of tactical genius by Manchester City coach Roberto Mancini who brought on Dutch midfielder Nigel De Jong and pushed Toure forward. Yet after the game Mancini remained cautious on his side's title hopes. ""I think it's not enough because we have another difficult game (against QPR),"" Mancini told British TV network Sky Sports. ""I think we deserved to win this game today."" Later on Sunday Manchester United took on Swansea City at a subdued Old Trafford knowing that defeat would virtually hand City the title. Two first half goals for Paul Scholes and Ashley Young gave United hope that they could score enough goals to make a dent in City's superior goal difference but the match finished 2-0. Now the season moves on to the final day of the season with City taking on QPR, who will need to win to guarantee they stay in the Premier League after their promotion last season, whilst United travel to Sunderland knowing they could win, finish the season on equal points and still lose the title. Both sides of Manchester will endure one final, tortuous 90 minutes to decide the fate of this season's Premier League trophy.","Man City beat Newcastle United 2-0 .

"(WIRED) -- Following a trend set by other carriers, AT&T has begun sending SMS warning messages to the top 5% of data users on its network. The message alerts consumers that they are among AT&T's top 5% that billing period, and suggests they use Wi-Fi to avoid reduced data speeds in the future. Although it's a pain to those affected, AT&T is being transparent about the issue, giving subscribers a chance to minimize their usage before getting their data speeds choked. Verizon began throttling users who consume a large amount of data, but didn't initially reveal the policy to the public, describe how it would be implemented or describe if and how users would be notified. It should be noted, however, that AT&T was the first carrier to introduce the tiered data plan structure to customers, setting the trend for other carriers to follow suit thereafter. AT&T did away with its unlimited data plan shortly after the iPhone 4 debuted last summer, replacing it with a tiered data structure. Currently, the most robust data option is a $25 per month 2 GB plan that allows you to go over that limit for $10 per extra GB. AT&T confirmed it would throttle the data speeds of the heaviest users on its network in late July. Verizon has a similar policy. The carrier will reduce data speeds ""periodically for the remainder of your then current and immediately following billing cycle"" if you fall within the top 5 percent of heavy data users. This is done in order to ""ensure high quality network performance"" for other users, especially in times and locations where there's peak demand. According to a developer forum, Verizon will call and then send a letter to users who are about to get their data speeds throttled. Verizon eliminated its unlimited data plan in July and now offers 2 GB for $30/month, 5 GB for $50 monthly and 10 GB for $80 monthly. T-Mobile offers an unlimited data plan that costs $100 per month, but throttles users who exceed 5 GB in a single billing cycle. That leaves Sprint as the only carrier that still offers an unlimited data plan without any kind of throttling (unlimited data and minutes for $100/month), but the carrier does tack on a $10 ""Premium Data"" fee for smartphone owners. Sprint is rumored to begin carrying the iPhone this year, which would make it the only carrier to allow users an unlimited data plan with the popular phone. Business analyst and Redditor Zaied Ali was one of the recipients of AT&T's recent round of SMS alerts. He used between 11 and 12 GB of data this month, but normally averages around 6 GB to 7 GB. Ali thinks that AT&T's throttling policy reduces the utility of his smartphone, since he has to think twice about how he uses his phone. ""What is the point of a Netflix app if we don't have the back-end to fully support it?"" Ali says. ""The tiered data plan is in the right direction, but then don't throttle your users. Let them use what they pay for at the speeds that they paid for."" Another Redditor, Skelatwork, amassed a similar level of data this billing period and received an SMS warning. Skelatwork said that he reached the 11 GB mark by listening to podcasts and Pandora on his commute to work. A Wired.com poll of 11,000 data plan subscribers showed that 73% use less than 2 GB of data each month. Consumer Reports similarly found that the average iPhone user only gobbles 273 MB of data each month. So right now, the throttling issue is generally only affecting a small number of users. As the use of cloud storage and streaming music and video services becomes more widespread, the issue of these data caps and speed throttling is likely to get more heated.

"(CNN) -- Increased militarization in Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala has created more insecurity, especially for women, a report spearheaded by two Nobel laureates found. ""The war on drugs ... has become a war on women,"" Nobel Peace Prize laureates Jody Williams and Rigoberta Menchu wrote in the report, based on a 10-day fact-finding mission. ""Efforts to improve 'security' have only led to greater militarization, rampant corruption and abuse within police forces and an erosion of rule of law."" After consulting with presidents, high-ranking officials, human rights activists and others, the team compiled statistics to illustrate the problem. In Honduras, for instance, the homicide rate for women has been increasing four times faster than that of men, said Gilda Rivera, of the Center for Women's Rights in that country. The report says violence against women has become a crisis. Rivera called it an epidemic. In the three countries studied, the respective governments are facing a national security threat from drug cartels. To wrest control from the encroaching drug cartels and to protect citizens, these countries have responded with a strong hand. Most are familiar with Mexico's case, in which nearly 50,000 have been killed in drug cartel-related violence since 2006. More recently, Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina was elected in part because of his promises of a strong response to the violence. The report argues that instead of providing safety, the additional troops and police on the streets are having the opposite effect: committing abuses and stirring up more violence. ""Increasing militarization and police repression under the guise of the war on drugs has led to more violence overall and more frequent attacks on women, who lead efforts to protect their communities against threats to their lands and natural resources, and protest military and police abuses,"" the report states. A segment of the militarized approach, the report notes, comes from U.S. aid. The report found that femicides increased by 257% in Honduras from 2002 to 2010, a period that saw a doubling of U.S. money for military and police. Using the start of Mexican President Felipe Calderon's term as a benchmark, the report says femicides there rose 40% since 2006. In Guatemala, 685 women were killed in 2010, compared with 213 in 2000, the report states. In that time, security aid to Guatemala increased threefold, the report found. In all, the team spoke with more than 200 female survivors who shared their stories. The authors say they found another disturbing pattern: Most of the crimes against women in these countries are carried out with impunity. ""The mounting crimes of extreme violence and targeted repression against women remain largely uninvestigated, unsolved and unpunished, due to fragile state institutions, deep flaws in the political and justice systems of these countries and a lack of political will to reform policies and institutions that implicitly condone them,"" the report says. The authors highlighted the May 11 case of four civilians killed by Honduran police on a helicopter who mistook them them for drug traffickers. Two of the victims were pregnant women. The DEA was aiding the police, though the agency says it did so only in a supporting role. ""I am horrified, but the truth is, this happens over and over again to women in the region,"" Williams said. The report was a collaboration between the Nobel Women's Initiative and Just Associates.","Jody Williams and Rigoberta Menchu led fact-finding trip to Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala .

"(CNN) -- When you visit the doctor, chances are you are given a prescription for a drug or an order for an X-ray or lab test. Before you leave, it's important to ask whether your doctor's recommendations are truly necessary. Even though much of what physicians do is meant to help patients, sometimes it's not always the case. Drugs may have harmful side effects and tests have the potential for adverse complications. Unnecessary tests and medications contribute significantly to our country's spiraling health costs. It's estimated that $700 billion of our $2 trillion annual health spending falls under the category of wasteful medicine. Consider the common sinus infection, which brings 16 million Americans into the doctor's office each year. Unfortunately, most of these cases have a viral cause, so antibiotics won't help the patient. Despite that, antibiotics are still prescribed in 80% of cases. Sinus infections alone equal $5.8 billion in health care costs each year. Or, take the example of prostate cancer screening on a certain demographic. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of nongovernment clinicians who provide evidence-based practice guidelines, recommends against screening men over age 75 for prostate cancer. Studies have shown that the benefit of prostate cancer screening is uncertain and further tempered by the complications from treatment, which can include impotence and urinary incontinence. However, a December 2011 study from the Archives of Internal Medicine reveals that more than half of men over 75 continue to undergo prostate cancer screenings. This past week, the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation along with nine professional physician groups released a list of 45 common tests and procedures that are performed too often. The list includes electrocardiograms for asymptomatic patients, imaging tests for routine back pain, and Pap smears for women younger than 21 years old. Along with the recommendations to cut down on these procedures, an education campaign called Choosing Wisely was launched with the goal to start the important conversation between doctors and patients about the necessity, or lack thereof, of these commonly ordered tests. But implementing these guidelines into everyday practice may not be easy. Most doctors don't have the time to go into detailed discussions about all the options on the table. If I try to explain to my elderly male patients why prostate cancer screening doesn't always help, or inform young adults that antibiotics aren't necessary for most sinus infections, it would take much more time than the 15 minutes that I can give for a routine office visit. In many cases, it's quicker to simply order a test or prescribe a drug, which takes seconds, rather than go into the pros and cons of a treatment path. The medical community needs to come up with strong incentives to encourage doctors to spend more time educating their patients about the harms of over-testing, and soliciting their input when considering various options. When patients play an active role in their medical decisions, studies show they tend to choose less aggressive treatment paths. There's also the threat of malpractice, which makes it difficult for doctors to rein in tests. A recent survey of 1,214 orthopedic surgeons found that 30% of the tests they ordered didn't help patients, and were mainly aimed at reducing exposure to liability suits. If doctors who restrict unnecessary testing according to the new guidelines can be provided with appropriate legal protection, then it's more likely that they will actually do so. Finally, whenever the topic of limiting tests is raised in today's partisan environment, the specter of rationing is often brought up. Back in 2009 when a recommendation against routine mammograms for women age 40 to 49 came out, there was a backlash despite the fact that the basis for it was scientifically reasonable. Politicizing medical recommendations that are backed by solid research will only hinder doctors from doing a better job. Today, discussing whether tests and treatments actually help patients or cause more harm doesn't happen nearly enough. By providing a specific list of procedures to question -- and to cut down -- the medical community hopes to push us in the right direction. More people need to realize that limiting unnecessary tests is not rationing. It's a way to potentially cut the waste out of our health system, and also reminds doctors of a promise they make to each and every patient: a promise to do no harm. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kevin Pho.","About $700 billion of our $2 trillion annual health spending is considered wasteful medicine .

"(EW.com) -- ""Bully,"" the controversial documentary that was handcuffed with an R rating by the MPAA, will be released in theaters as an unrated film, The Weinstein Company announced today.

"(CNN) -- Authorities are searching for a British sailor who disappeared after arriving in Dubai. Timothy Andrew MacColl, 27, was last seen getting into a taxi about 2 a.m. on Sunday, May 27, his family said. ""It is known that he had just left the Rock Bottom Bar which is at the Regent Hotel in the area of Deira,"" the family said in a statement. The bar is about a 15-minute drive from Port Rashid, where MacColl's ship, the HMS Westminster, had docked the previous day, the family said. A shipmate saw him get into the taxi alone, the statement said. MacColl is married and has two children, ages 6 and 4. His wife, Rachel, is expecting their third child in October. ""We are desperately worried. Checks have been made with hospitals, prisons, police stations, medical stations and mortuaries and there is no record of him and no sightings so far,"" Rachel MacColl said in the statement. ""I last spoke with Timmy at midday on Saturday and he was in really good spirits and looking forward to speaking with the children on Skype on Sunday. That call never happened. It is completely out of character for him not to contact us, and we are completely at a loss and going crazy with worry. ""Wherever Timmy is, I know that he wants to be found. ... He may be in trouble somewhere, he could be trapped as far as we know, we have absolutely no idea. Please, please help us find him."" A spokesman for Britain's Royal Navy confirmed that MacColl is ""unaccounted for in Dubai"" and said ""everything is being done to ensure that he is located safely."" British authorities are working with local authorities. ""We take great care to look after all members of the Naval Service wherever they serve around the world,"" the navy spokesman said.

"(CNN) -- When Aimee Copeland, a 24-year-old Georgia woman who lost parts of four limbs to a flesh-eating bacteria, returns home from rehab next month, she'll find it much different and much bigger than when she left in May. A nearly 2,000-square-foot addition will nearly double the size of the Copeland family home in Snellville, Georgia, east of Atlanta, and be equipped for her special needs. The renovation plans include access ramps, an elevator to the home's second floor, an exercise room Aimee will use to continue her recovery, guide rails in the bathroom and a separate wash sink Aimee can use to clean her prosthetics. The family calls it ""Aimee's Wing."" ""What blows me away is that the construction should be complete in roughly 40 days, hopefully in time for Aimee's 'graduation' from rehab,"" dad Andy Copeland said in his blog Tuesday. Pulte Homes, a Michigan-based company that builds homes in 27 states, is donating the construction addition. Aimee Copeland was released from the hospital to a rehab facility on July 2 after nearly two months of treatment and surgeries. Copeland's ordeal began May 1 when she was riding a makeshift zip line across the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta. The line snapped, and she fell and received a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close. Three days later, still in pain, she went to an emergency room. Doctors eventually determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila. Since then, her father has blogged about her situation regularly. A Facebook page devoted to her fight has nearly 80,000 ""likes."" A number of bacteria that are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections can lead to necrotizing fasciitis, or flesh-eating bacteria syndrome. When the bacteria get into the bloodstream, such as through a cut, doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remain. Advocate: Story of rare bacterial infection raising awareness . The infection attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20% of the time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, estimates that fewer than 250 such cases occur each year in the United States, though estimates are imprecise since doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities. Andy Copeland says his daughter is ""knocking it out in rehab,"" committed to her exercise regime like an Olympic athlete. ""Her face was red and the vein in her neck was bulging as she pressed herself into her repetitions with serious determination,"" Copeland said of Aimee's Tuesday workout. ""It's like she was training for the Olympics."" On Wednesday, she will be fitted with test sockets for her prosthetics, her dad said. If all goes well, in a few weeks, she will begin to be fitted with prosthetic limbs. But her progress appears to come with a tinge of sadness. ""As I sit here and type I realize just how fortunate I am, we are, to have hands,"" Andy Copeland said. ""Take a moment tonight, tomorrow, every doggone day, to thank God for what you have. Taking time to realize your blessings makes life all the more worth living."" CNN's Jennifer Bixler contributed to this report.","Aimee Copeland's rehab is expected to last into August .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has concluded Texas can execute a Mexican man sentenced to death for murder, ending an unusual capital appeal that pitted President Bush against his home state in a dispute over federal authority, local sovereignty and foreign treaties. The case decided by the Supreme Court on Tuesday pitted President Bush against his home state, Texas. The 6-3 vote Tuesday means the pending execution of Jose Ernesto Medellin can proceed. He faces lethal injection for two brutal slayings. At issue was whether the state had to give in to a demand by the president that the prisoner be allowed new hearings and sentencing. Bush made that demand reluctantly after an international court concluded Medellin was improperly denied access to his consulate before his original prosecution, a violation of a treaty signed by the United States decades ago. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion saying the international court ""is not domestic law,"" thereby restricting the president's power over states. ""The executive's narrow and strictly limited authority to settle international claims disputes pursuant to an executive agreement cannot stretch so far as to support the current presidential memorandum"" that would force Texas to conduct a new state trial, he wrote. Medellin was 18 when he participated in the June 1993 gang rape and murder of two Harris County, Texas, girls: Jennifer Ertman, 14, and Elizabeth Pena, 16. He was convicted of the crimes and sentenced to death. Medellin's lawyers argued he was not informed upon his arrest of his right to contact Mexican consular officials. Those officials were never able to meet with him until after his conviction. About 43 other Mexican nationals awaiting execution in various states -- including 13 in Texas -- also will be affected by the high court ruling. Only Oklahoma has commuted a capital inmate's sentence to life in prison in response to the international judgment. The Mexican government filed an appeal against the United States with the International Court of Justice in January 2003, alleging violations of international law. Medellin filed his own federal and state appeals based on similar complaints as well as a claim of ineffective counsel. Medellin has the support of the European Union and several international human rights groups. The ICJ ruled in 2004 the United States had violated the rights of the Mexican prisoners, in part because officials and prosecutors failed to notify their home countries, which could have provided legal and other assistance. The ICJ judges ordered the United States to provide ""review and reconsideration"" of the sentences and convictions of the Mexican prisoners. The court is based in The Hague, Netherlands, and resolves disputes between nations over treaty obligations. The United States is one of the signatories to the 1963 Vienna Convention, laying out rights of people detained in other nations. The case turned on what role each branch of government plays to give force to international treaty obligations. Roberts concluded international court judgments cannot be forced upon individual states. The president cannot ""establish binding rules of decision that pre-empt contrary state law,"" he said, and the treaty does not specifically require states to remedy any treaty violations. The chief justice was supported in his position by Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. In dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer said the presidential memorandum in this case was ""self-executing,"" and warned, ""the nation may well break its word even though the president seeks to live up to that word and Congress has done nothing to suggest the contrary."" He was supported by Justice David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice John Paul Stevens, who normally opposes the use of the death penalty, agreed with his conservative colleagues in this case. But he suggested the legal responsibility now falls on the state to give Medellin a fresh hearing, calling it a ""modest cost of compliance."" ""Texas' duty in this respect is all the greater since it was Texas that -- by failing to provide consular notice in accordance with the Geneva Convention -- ensnared the United States in the current controversy. Having put the nation in breach of one treaty, it is now up to Texas to prevent breach of another."" Lawyers for the administration and Medellin argued Bush properly exercised his unilateral executive authority, which a majority of justices had questioned in oral arguments last September. The Mexican government filed an appeal with the ICJ against the United States in January 2003, alleging violations of international law. Medellin filed his own federal and state appeals based on similar complaints, as well as a claim of ineffective counsel. Medellin has the support of the European Union and several international human rights groups. Bush said he disagreed with the international court's conclusions but agreed to comply with them. In a February 28, 2005, executive order, he said, ""The United States will discharge its international obligations ... by having state courts give effect to the decision."" But a Texas appeals court later rejected that executive authority. In a sharply worded opinion, Judge Sharon Keller concluded the president's ""unprecedented, unnecessary, and intrusive exercise of power over the Texas court system cannot be supported by the foreign policy authority conferred on him by the United States Constitution."" The Constitution does not directly give the president the power to enforce the treaties agreed to by the United States. However, Article VI says that ""all treaties made ... under the authority of the United States shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby."" Lawyers for the administration and Medellin argued Bush properly exercised his unilateral executive authority, which several justices had questioned in oral arguments last September. Texas Solicitor General Ted Cruz told the high court the president's action was ""a very curious assertion of presidential authority,"" saying it ""singles out the states, commandeers those judges."" The Bush White House typically backs states in their power to carry out executions, but Justice Department officials said that in these instances, the president's power to conduct foreign policy outweighed states' interests. The Supreme Court originally heard the Medellin case in 2005 but did not rule on the merits, waiting instead for lower courts to resolve the federalism angle.

Her big break came in 1999, when she appeared as President Jed Bartlett's secretary Dolores Landingham on the critically acclaimed drama series, ""The West Wing."" Her character died in a car crash in the 2001 season. After several more productive years, in 2005 Joosten landed the role of Karen McCluskey -- the crusty, older neighbor living among a roster of beautiful, if often troubled women on Wisteria Lane in ""Desperate Housewives."" Joosten's performance earned her two Emmy awards, in 2005 and 2008, for outstanding guest actress in a comedy series. Off the set, her life was defined by her family and, more recently, her bout with lung cancer.

"Santa Paula, California (CNN) -- When disaster strikes and people are buried in rubble, there's often no better search tool than a dog's nose. It's a valuable asset that has already been utilized several times this year. Trained search dogs, along with their human handlers, have provided help in high-profile disasters such as the Japan earthquake in March and the Joplin, Missouri, tornado in May. ""After a disaster, there is a window of opportunity for finding live people,"" said Wilma Melville, founder of the National Disaster Search Dog Foundation. ""The first eight hours are critical."" There are about 250 search-and-rescue teams, each made up of a dog and a handler, that are certified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But Melville says that's half as many as there should be. ""Approximately 500 teams, I feel, would cover the country well for the hurricanes on the East Coast, the great center of the country, which is bombarded and tormented with tornadoes, and the West Coast, which can definitely anticipate earthquakes,"" she said. ""We should have about 500 teams, highly trained, strategically placed, ready to reach a disaster site within 12 hours."" Since 1996, Melville and her organization have been creating and training more of these teams. It starts by finding shelter dogs with the potential to become search dogs. Then it trains the dogs and pairs them with a firefighter or rescue worker who will live, train and work with them. ""The Search Dog Foundation is the only group in the nation that gives a highly trained, professionally trained dog, to a handler and then stays with that handler for the rest of the team's life together,"" said Melville, 77. ""We provide health insurance for the dog. ... We provide food for the dog. The big thing is, we provide ongoing training for that dog and handler."" Melville's nonprofit has also streamlined the training process so that it can be done in about a year rather than the three or four years it once used to take. In all, the group has trained 131 teams around the country -- for free. It has responded to 80 missions around the world, including Japan, Joplin, last year's Haiti earthquake and the September 11 attacks in New York City. But it was a 1995 tragedy -- the federal building bombing in Oklahoma City -- that inspired Melville to create it. She and her black lab, Murphy, had been training together for several years before they made the trip to Oklahoma City to help find victims. Melville had started the training as a hobby after retirement, and she and Murphy were FEMA-certified in 1994. After arriving in Oklahoma City, Melville said, she was devastated by the scope of the tragedy, in which 168 people were killed. One survivor was found by a dog, she said. Later, Melville was surprised and outraged to learn that there were only about 15 similar canine teams in the country. ""We are a huge nation, and this one building alone requires far more than 15 dogs that are highly trained,"" Melville remembered thinking. ""This nation is in a terrible situation. ... ""I said: ""Well, there's only one thing to do. I either go back to my horseback riding in the hills, or I make a difference and find a better way to create canine disaster search teams for this nation.' "" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2012 CNN Heroes . The Search Dog Foundation receives no federal or state money. Melville said it's funded by grants, donations, awards and corporate support. About 90% of the dogs that it trains come from shelters. Hundreds of dogs are tested each year for training, but only a small amount get selected. Even fewer make it through the training. The dogs must have drive, focus and high energy, Melville said. Eric Gray's dog, Riley, was a former shelter dog rejected by two foster homes because he was deemed too hyper to be a pet. But his search-and-rescue training ""gave him a purpose,"" Gray said, adding that Riley has become an important partner in his efforts as a firefighter. ""(Riley) was able to focus the incessant drive ... that he had, and (he was given) an opportunity to really blossom as a dog rather than just being handed from home to home,"" Gray said. The two recently helped with search-and-rescue efforts in Haiti and Japan. Veteran handler Debra Tosch searched the World Trade Center with her dog, Abby, after the September 11 attacks. ""When I rounded that corner and was a little overwhelmed by the enormity of it, Abby had just the opposite effect,"" Tosch said. ""She started pulling on the leash, saying: 'Great! We finally get to go to work. Let's go.' ... She got very excited."" Melville said search efforts are usually fun for the dog ""because they don't get a paycheck. They get a toy, and the toy is their reward."" Even after winning several awards for her work, Melville believes she is far from done. Her foundation is building a national training center on 125 acres of Santa Paula hills between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. ""In my heart, the number 168 is forever engraved,"" she said. ""I still want to train 168 canine disaster search teams -- one for each of the persons who died in Oklahoma City. ... ""Now, I see that it is possible -- it's even likely -- within my lifetime. I wonder who number 168 will be."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Fans from across Europe will soon be traveling to Poland to support their teams during Euro 2012, but so too will police officers from each nation to keep an eye on them. When their national teams are playing, visiting police officers will be at Poland's police headquarters in Warsaw, the nerve-center for security operations during the event. Poland has a lot riding on the tournament it is co-hosting with Ukraine, and is no stranger to football violence. Last year's Polish Cup Final between Legia Warsaw and Lech Poznan was a high-profile example of how domestic football in Poland is still blighted by hooliganism, as violent fans clashed with police and water cannons had to be used to control the crowd. Even before that incident, UEFA, European football's governing body, had criticized Poland for football violence which it said was ruining the country's reputation. However police in the capital have spent years preparing for Euro 2012 and reducing the potential of trouble from homegrown and international football hooligans. Like all major international events terrorism is the main security concern. ""The whole security plan is ready; the right equipment has been bought,"" says Mariusz Sokolowski, press officer for the Polish police force. ""The sites that needed to be renovated for the tournament have also been completed. And now it's a time to put all that we have done into practice."" The new National Stadium in Warsaw hosted a friendly match between Poland and Portugal in February this year, when the local police force was able to test their readiness. It was called a success by UEFA. ""We know what we deliver has to be the best, at the top level,"" says Beata Stelmach, Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister. ""We are absolutely the best prepared for Euro 2012 and welcome everybody who wants not only to see football games, but also to see how hospitable we are and how beautiful the country is."" Poland is following on from lessons learned at recent big European tournaments, like Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland, and Germany's staging of the World Cup in 2006. There will be ""fan zones"" with big screens and entertainment dotted around the major cities, where traveling fans without tickets can watch the matches. ""The less we are visible and less we need to act the better the event will be as it will show that Euro 2012 will be a very safe event,"" says Sokolowski.

"Miami (CNN) -- Former teen idol David Cassidy was ordered to serve a year of probation and had his license suspended for six months after pleading no contest Wednesday to a DUI charge in Florida. Among the other terms of the plea, the former star of the TV series ""The Partridge Family"" must attend DUI school, pay a $500 fine and serve 50 hours of community service, said Gayle Braun, supervisor of the misdemeanor and juvenile divisions of the state attorney's office for the judicial circuit encompassing St. Lucie County. The sentence was the minimum mandatory sentence for all first-time DUI offenders who plead no contest. The attorney for the 60-year-old actor and musician entered the plea for his client, who was not present in court. A Florida Highway Patrol officer stopped him in Fort Pierce last November after his Mercedes left the roadway and went onto the shoulder rumble strip two times before cutting off another car at an exit ramp, the police report said. Cassidy failed roadside sobriety tests and registered at 0.14% blood alcohol content on a breath test, nearly twice the state's 0.08% legal limit, according to the arrest report. The singer-actor ""appeared to be somewhat confused"" and was ""very apologetic for having to be stopped,"" the arresting officer said. Police found a half-empty bottle of bourbon under the seat of Cassidy's Mercedes, although he told the officer he had consumed only one glass of wine with lunch several hours earlier, the report said. He also told the officer he had taken a hydrocodone pill -- a pain medication also known as Vicodin -- about three hours earlier. On the TV series, Cassidy played the eldest of five children of a widowed mother (Shirley Jones, who was Cassidy's real-life step-mother). The family -- all of them musicians -- traveled to gigs in a repainted school bus. When the show was canceled after four seasons, Cassidy launched his own pop music career, filling concert halls with screaming teen-aged girls attracted to such hits as ""I Think I Love You."" His most recent acting job was on the 2009 ABC Family sitcom ""Ruby & the Rockits,"" in which Cassidy played an aging former teen heartthrob. The show was canceled after one season.","Former star of ""The Partridge Family"" ordered to serve a year of probation .

"(CNN) -- At the beginning of 2008, everything seemed set for Bill Clinton. His wife, Hillary, had the money and the endorsements to run for the presidency. She also had the experience and the talismanic Democratic last name. Everything was in place for Bill's return to the White House, this time as first gentleman. Then came Iowa, when the supposedly unstoppable Hillary for president locomotive was derailed by Barack Obama, a first-term senator from Illinois. Bill Clinton couldn't believe that this Johnny-come-lately might block his wife's path to the White House. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama may be making common cause now, but four years ago the future president drove the former president crazy. Obama's sins in the eyes of Bill Clinton in 2008 were numerous and grievous: He denied Hillary a shot at the Oval Office that Bill believed she earned and he attacked Bill by playing the race card, or so Bill believed. In reality, Clinton played the race card on himself when he compared Obama's victory in the South Carolina primary to Jesse Jackson's wins there in 1984 and 1988. Perhaps Clinton's intent was to isolate Obama as the ""black candidate""; perhaps not, but an uproar ensued, deeply wounding the man who had been beloved by African-American voters throughout his political career. Obama had even gone so far as to compare Bill Clinton unfavorably to Ronald Reagan, saying that Reagan had ""changed the trajectory"" of the nation ""in a way that Bill Clinton did not."" The nerve of this whippersnapper, ranking the first Democratic president since FDR to serve two full terms below the hero of the opposition party -- the party that had tried to throw that Democratic president out of office. By drawing that contrast, Obama was consciously baiting Bill, secure in the knowledge that as Hillary's campaign brain trust, his outbursts -- about Reagan, about the ""fairy tale"" of Obama's pure opposition to the Iraq War, about the ""race card"" -- were doing harm to his wife's campaign. But Obama's biggest offense was simply that he was seeking to replace Bill Clinton as first in the hearts of the Democratic faithful. And he was doing it courtesy of a free ride from the media -- nothing like the trial by fire that Bill had undergone in 1992. Once the nomination fight ended, Hillary was quick to dismiss her ill feelings toward Obama. But insiders say Bill nursed his grudge, only slowly releasing it as his wife took office as Obama's secretary of state. The coldness between the 42nd and 44th presidents persisted well into Obama's first term. Obama sought to set the nation's course on his own, without interference from the man who he said had not achieved the kind of transformative presidency to which he aspired. Within the Democratic Party, the two men were still rivals. It's no accident that Clinton has had a much warmer relationship with both Presidents Bush than he has had with Obama; he and the Bushes are not seeking approval from the same audience. Now, however, mutual interest has pushed Bill and Barack together. While no one would confuse them for best friends, Obama needs Clinton's access to deep Democratic pockets and his appeal to white blue-collar voters, who are more attuned to Bill's messy I-feel-your-pain empathy than to the professorial coolness of Obama. For his part, Bill craves political relevance. In the 11-plus years of his post-presidency, he has succeeded in securing both public acclaim, for his work on AIDS, and private enrichment, pulling down well into six figures for a single speech. But talking to 10,000 people at a gathering of furniture-industry representatives, no matter how high the remuneration, can't compare to influencing a presidential election -- or, for that matter, to pressing the flesh in a high-school gymnasium packed with adoring fans. What's more, if Hillary does follow the advice Bill is certain to whisper in her ear and run for the presidency in 2016, when she will be 69, the party chits he is now amassing will certainly come in handy. Bill Clinton's political advice to Obama to focus less on likely GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney's inconsistency and more on his devotion to ""severe"" conservatism comes directly from the Clinton playbook of 1995-96. After the drubbing he took in the 1994 midterms, Clinton revived his fortunes by depicting his Republican opponents in Congress, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, as a band of radical ideologues seeking to knock down the underpinnings of middle-class American life, and himself as the only thing stopping them. The strategy succeeded. When the government shut down in late 1995, the public blamed Gingrich. Seeking the president's re-election, the Clinton campaign hung the unpopular speaker around the neck of the Republican nominee, Bob Dole, and that was that. Obama has the opportunity to position himself as the reasonable centrist seeking to save the nation from the depredations it would suffer were a radical opposition to gain unchecked power. He has plenty of material to work with -- the Republicans in power today make the ones Clinton faced seem like Swedish socialists. It's good advice. Whatever his feelings toward Bill Clinton, Obama should listen to him. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Takiff.","President Obama has actively embraced Bill Clinton for help on raising money and gaining voters .

"(CNN) -- In the last six months, the Obama administration has been pushing for a change in labor regulations that would, for the first time since the 1970s, make home care workers eligible for overtime pay under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. While the motive behind the proposed changes is noble, the unintended consequences are too great to overlook. We can all agree that providing higher wages to home care workers would reward professional caregivers, attract more qualified people to this growing industry and improve care for the elderly and disabled. These are common goals for both caregivers and families. However, mandating that home care workers be eligible for overtime pay will have the opposite effect. As the head of a home care agency in Massachusetts, I am required by state law to pay overtime to caregivers who are eligible. For those of us who hoped the law would result in caregivers earning more money, it is disappointing. The reality is that many home care workers' weekly wages would be higher if overtime pay were not required. Why? The answer is simple: The law does not -- and cannot -- require families or home care agencies to employ the same caregiver once that person reaches the overtime threshold. When a caregiver has put in 40 hours during the week, employers usually switch to other workers who have not yet reached that limit, even if the first worker is available and wants to earn more money. Imagine you are hiring, either directly or through a home care agency, someone to help keep a parent safe and comfortable at home. Your parent doesn't need medical services but requires assistance with bathing, dressing, walking, meal preparation and related activities. This ""long term custodial care"" is not covered by Medicare, so you have to pay out of pocket. While the costs can add up, it's less expensive than an assisted living facility. Let's say you need more than 40 hours of custodial home care every week. If your caregiver wants the extra income, you can arrange for him or her to work more than 40 hours at the wage you have agreed to. But what happens if the hourly rate for the caregiver goes up by 50%? If you were paying $20/hr through a home care agency, the cost would now come to about $28/hr -- a huge increase. Do you keep the same caregiver coming and pay $28/hr, or do you hire another one to finish out the week at $20/hour? If, like most families, you are on a budget that stretches every dollar, you would tell the first caregiver to stop work (and stop earning money) at 40 hours of service. You would then hire a second caregiver to finish the week. Opinion: Home care workers deserve protections . The fact is that many seniors in our country are living on limited budgets. Any increase in home care wage for caregivers means more money flowing out of the Social Security check or retirement savings of seniors. Most families have little incentive to pay the higher rates associated with overtime work. For a professional caregiver who wants to work more than 40 hours a week at the regular rate (and many do), that option evaporates when overtime pay is required. Someone who used to work 50 hours now can only work up to 40 hours. In states that require overtime pay, families often choose to not assign overtime hours to their caregivers. Home care workers do not wind up with overtime assignments and higher earnings; instead, they receive less work and make less money. Seniors who receive care have less access to the caregiver of their choice due to budgetary concerns. This is surely not an outcome sought by those who advocate revising the rules of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act. Choosing to expand a law whose effect clearly reduces the earnings of lower-earning workers is bad politics and bad policy. Paying home care workers more money would have clear social benefits, but if it comes at the cost of pricing vulnerable seniors out of the home care market or reducing the earning potential of caregivers, then we need to rethink our laws. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jim Reynolds.","Obama administration is revising labor rules to mandate overtime pay for home care workers .

"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- Emirati authorities canceled dozens of Syrians' residency permits after a protest against the Syrian government in the United Arab Emirates, sources said. More than 2,000 people protested against the Syrian regime on February 10, said a source close to the leadership of the Syrian National Council, which opposes the Syrian government. The demonstrators did not have a permit to protest outside the Syrian consulate in Dubai, the source said. The source said the SNC has been negotiating with the UAE's foreign ministry and was assured last week that the permits would be reinstated -- but that has not happened. Dubai police asked the protesters to leave. Most left, but dozens stayed behind and continued protesting, the source said. He said about 60 Syrians had their residency permits canceled. But a United Arab Emirates official said the number of Syrians affected was much lower. ""The decision was not to renew the residence of a few people -- much less than 60. It was around 30,"" said the official, who did not want to be identified. ""It was not to deport them or to send them to Syria. It was to give them the option to go anywhere they wish."" The official said authorities could have arrested hundreds because ""the demonstration was not licensed. It was not legal. Nevertheless, nobody touched anybody, nobody was arrested."" He added that the Syrians who lost residency permits had been ""involved in other activities"" -- but would not detail what those activities were. The first source, the one close to the SNC leadership, said UAE authorities gave the Syrians a Wednesday deadline to leave the country. At least five have left the UAE in recent days, including two to Cairo, two to Jordan and one to Saudi Arabia, he said. But the UAE official said the deadline is ""flexible."" The first source said while the protesters who stayed ""were in the wrong"" for not leaving when told to do so. But ""that doesn't mean the UAE needs to cancel their residencies."" He said protesters are ""asking for mercy from UAE authorities, as this won't just affect the men whose residencies were canceled -- but their families as well."" A Syrian who left after Emirati officials gave him 10 days to depart said he is worried about his future. ""I lived and worked in the UAE for years, all my family is there. I never did anything wrong,"" said the man who did not want to be named out of fear for his family.

"(CNN) -- A fierce storm tore Friday evening through the town of Bel Air in northeast Maryland, damaging buildings, peeling off roofs, flipping a pickup truck, and felling trees and light poles, officials said. At least four people were injured, said Dave Williams, a spokesman for the Harford County Volunteer Fire & EMS Association, in an e-mail to CNN affiliate WMAR. One of the injured was in a car dealership in the Fallston area, which partially collapsed, said Robert Thomas, a public information officer for Harford County. A second structure, a single-family home, was struck by a tree, he said. Two of the injured were taken to hospitals, he said. Central Harford County bore the brunt of it: two buildings -- a mobile office trailer and a one-story auto detailing and repair facility in the Fallston area -- were destroyed; more than a dozen homes were damaged, he said. Search-and-rescue operations were being conducted Friday night in the affected area, which was concentrated within a mile radius of Fallston, which had lost power, he said. A number of people were freed after becoming trapped, the Baltimore City Fire Department reported on its Twitter page. Bel Air is about 20 miles northeast of downtown Baltimore. Radar detected a funnel cloud in the area at 6:41 p.m., 11 miles northeast of the town, CNN's weather department said.

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- An abandoned van containing a device with 600 pounds of explosives was found in Newry, Northern Ireland, near the border with the Republic of Ireland, police said Saturday. The device, believed to be linked to dissident IRA groups opposed to the peace process, was ""fully primed and ready for use,"" police said. The bomb, found late Thursday, was one of the biggest found in Northern Ireland, police said. It could have caused ""death and massive destruction"" had it gone off, Chief Superintendent Alasdair Robinson told reporters in Ardmore. ""The device contained two blue barrels with 125kg of homemade explosives in each one, and a detonator -- all the equipment which meant this device was ready to go,"" he said. ""This was a very significant device -- twice the size of the bomb which was left at Newry Courthouse two years ago. If this had exploded it would have caused devastation. ""To put it in perspective, anyone within 50 meters of this device would have been killed and anyone within 100 meters, seriously injured."" The road leading to the border was closed within minutes after officers became aware of the suspicious vehicle, he said. A member of public raised the alert after driving past the abandoned van, he said. Robinson said it was too early to speculate on the intended target of the bomb, which was made safe late Friday. Asked about the threat from dissident groups, he said this was the third attempted attack in the Newry area over the past few weeks, but that all three had been dealt with. A lawmaker for the area, Northern Ireland government minister Danny Kennedy, said there was no doubt dissident IRA groups were behind the Newry device. VICE.com: War is over, yet conflict continues in Belfast . He added: ""Clearly this was an attempt to lure police into the area with potentially fatal consequences. My fear is unless these dissidents are dealt with they have huge potential to cause death and destruction."" A small bomb was also found under a parked car in Belfast overnight and disarmed by the army, police said Saturday. Dissident IRA groups are suspected in that attempted attack too although police continue to investigate the motive. Chief Inspector Ian Campbell said, ""Those responsible have shown callous disregard for members of the public and the finger of suspicion points towards dissident republican terrorists."" Police found guns and ammunition in raids Friday targeting IRA dissidents in Belfast. A rally is being staged in Londonderry later Saturday by mainstream republicans to protest against dissident-linked vigilante groups killing and maiming suspected criminals in the city.","NEW: Those behind a small car bomb in Belfast show a ""callous disregard"" for the public, police say .

"(CNN) -- Montreal authorities on Saturday detailed the charges pending against a self-proclaimed porn star, accusing him of first-degree murder in the grisly killing and dismembering of a university student and threatening, among others, Canada's prime minister. The suspect -- 29-year-old Luka Rocco Magnotta -- remains at large despite a massive international manhunt. The search for him began after a severed hand and foot were mailed to the Ottawa headquarters of Canada's Liberal and Conservative parties, while a torso was discovered stuffed in a suitcase and tossed in the trash heap of a Montreal apartment building. What specific accusations he would face if he's captured became clearer Saturday, when police in Montreal released information from his arrest warrant. Besides murder, the charges include producing, distributing or possessing ""any obscene written matter, picture, model ... or other thing,"" mailing ""anything that is obscene, indecent, immoral or scurrilous,"" and ""improperly or indecently (offering) any indignity to a dead human body or human remains."" The accusations relate to the violent death of a Concordia University student from China. Montreal police Commander Ian Lafreniere identified the victim Friday as 33-year-old Jun Lin. The Chinese consulate in Montreal said Lin was from the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Police believe Lin was killed and his body dismembered either on May 24 or 25 in a Montreal apartment. A 10-minute video showing what transpired was then posted online. ""We believe he filmed himself,"" Lafreniere said earlier this week of the suspect. ""It's gross ... This is a very deranged person. He is looking for attention and he got it, but not in a positive way."" According to a more detailed copy of the arrest warrant posted on the website of CBC, the fifth charge of ""uttering threats"" accuses Magnotta of ""causing (Prime Minister) Stephen Harper and members of parliament to reasonably fear for their safety."" Harper is the leader of the Conservative party, one of the offices that had body parts mailed to it. Magnotta, who was born as Eric Clinton Newman and also uses the alias Vladimir Romanov, fled by plane from Montreal to Europe, Lafreniere has said. That prompted Interpol, the global police agency, to alert authorities in 190 countries. Police have reason to believe Magnotta might have gone to Eastern Europe, given his Russian pseudonym and writings on his Web page. On Friday, police had indications that the suspect may have been aboard a flight traveling from Paris to Montreal. Yet there was no sign of him after a search of the plane, Lafreniere said. Having earlier indicated that Magnotta is good at disguising himself, the police commander said Saturday that the suspect could now be anywhere in Europe, though authorities haven't ruled out the possibility he may be back in Canada. Police described Magnotta as being 5 feet, 8 inches tall and about 135 pounds, with black hair and blue eyes. His name may not have been known before this week, but his digital footprints were large. He was notorious among online animal rights activists, who pegged him as a serial kitten killer who used cat carcasses in sexual acts. A Facebook group started in December 2010 dubbed him the ""Vacuum Kitten Killer,"" after a video was posted on YouTube showing kittens being killed by suffocation and drowning. ""Members of this group have spent over a year searching for this individual, who we believe is also responsible for several videos where animals were killed,"" the group said Thursday. ""Information gathered by group members was passed on to the authorities in Canada, and we were informed that they were actively working on locating the person seen in the videos hurting animals."" Lafreniere has said police are aware of the animal abuse allegations. On what appears to be his own website, Magnotta defended himself as a victim of cyberstalking. ""Once and for all, I will set the record straight,"" he wrote. ""Many hoax websites are created using my image and name, posing as me to seem more believable in respect to the type of audience these website (sic) have, I feel I don't need to list them specifically but people need not be told, not to believe what they read and to take it as fact."" The website has writing in Arabic and Russian, and shows images of Magnotta half-naked and with lips in a distinct runway pout. Lafreniere from the Montreal police expressed confidence that Magnotta will be caught sooner or later -- predicting his desire for attention may be his downfall. ""This man uses the Web to glorify himself, and (authorities) hope this habit will lead to his capture,"" the police commander said Saturday. CNN's Paula Newton in Toronto contributed to this report.","Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, is the focus of a massive international manhunt .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The police investigation of Whitney Houston's death is ""officially closed"" with the conclusion that her death was an accidental drowning, the Beverly Hills Police Department said Wednesday. With the case closed, police released the recording of the 911 emergency call in which a hotel security officer said the woman who called for help from Houston's room was ""irate and pretty much out of it."" Investigators ""found no evidence of foul play,"" a police statement said. ""Based on the findings of our investigation and our review of the coroner's report, we have determined that this is not a criminal matter."" The Los Angeles County coroner released its autopsy report a week ago saying Houston's February 11 death was an accidental drowning with the ""effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use"" as contributing factors. The Beverly Hilton security officer did not identify Houston in the 911 call. ""I need paramedics, apparently I've got a 46-year-old female, found in the bathroom,"" he told the 911 operator. ""That's all I've got right now, but they're requesting paramedics."" (Houston actually was 48). The autopsy report said her assistant found Houston face down in a tub of ""extremely hot water"" about 12 inches deep. ""I'm not sure if she fell, or if she was in the bathroom with the water,"" the hotel security officer is heard saying in the 911 call. And you don't know if she's conscious or breathing at all?"" the dispatcher asked. ""Apparently she wasn't breathing,"" the hotel employee said. When the dispatcher asked if she had started breathing, the security officer said ""I don't know. The person that called me was irate and pretty much out of it."" ""Can you get me into the room so I can try to give CPR instructions?"" the 911 operator asked. ""No, because she kept hanging up on us,"" the hotel security officer said. Houston was last seen alive by her personal assistant in her Beverly Hilton hotel room about 3 p.m. that Saturday, the autopsy report said. The assistant left to run errands after telling Houston to take a bath in preparation for a pre-Grammy Awards party at the hotel that night, it said. When the assistant returned to the locked room at 3:35 p.m., she found Houston ""lying face down in the bathtub filled with water, unresponsive."" ""The assistant called for her bodyguard, and together they pulled the decedent out of the bathtub,"" the report said. When paramedics arrived about 10 minutes later, they moved Houston to the living room floor. It was at 3:55 p.m., 20 minutes after she was found by the assistant, when paramedics concluded she was dead, the report said. The coroner's report stopped short of detailing what happened to Houston, but HLN's Dr. Drew Pinsky, an addiction medicine specialist, examined the autopsy report for CNN and suggested that she might have suffered a seizure brought on by the use of cocaine, possibly combined with a withdrawal from alcohol and a prescription sedative. An empty bottle of the anti-anxiety drug Xanax was found in her room, but the level of the sedative found in her blood was low, he said. Empty beer bottles were also found, but alcohol was not detected in her body, he said. ""To me, a sudden drop-off in the Xanax level, a drop-off in your alcohol consumption, add cocaine, that's a recipe for a seizure,"" Pinsky said. ""Somebody who's now upside down in a bathtub could easily seize and drown."" However, Henry Spiller, a toxicologist and director of the Kentucky Regional Poison Control Center, said the level of Xanax found in Houston's blood was not low enough to trigger a seizure. Those who abuse Xanax can take up to 20 pills a day, he said, and the level found in Houston's body would indicate she took four to six pills several hours before she died. Since the drug was found in her blood, a seizure brought on by withdrawal is unlikely, he said. The coroner's report notes that Houston suffered several small scald burns on her face at the time of her death. A 60% narrowing of her arteries found in the autopsy is ""very mild heart disease,"" Pinsky said, which should not have caused a problem. Spiller said that based on his experience with cocaine abusers, two things may have happened: Either Houston had a seizure and fell into the tub, or she had a cardiac arrhythmia. An arrhythmia occurs when the heart stops beating properly and fails to pump, depriving the brain of oxygen and causing a loss of consciousness. It can be fatal. ""If you look at cocaine deaths, more deaths are from arrhythmias than seizures,"" Spiller said. ""Based on what is in the report, it seems more likely that she had a vasospasm (which shuts off blood flow to the heart) or a fatal arrhythmia."" Toxicology testing measured 0.58 micrograms of cocaine per milliliter of blood drawn from a vein in her leg during the autopsy, which Pinsky called a moderate level. Spiller said for that level of cocaine to be in Houston's body, ""we're talking about approximately half a gram of cocaine having been possibly ingested within 30 minutes to 90 minutes before her death. For someone who has been abusing cocaine, this may be their routine amount, but (for) someone who doesn't regularly use cocaine and therefore doesn't have a tolerance for the drug, this would be a high level."" Houston's cocaine use appeared to have occurred ""in the time period just immediately prior to her collapse in the bathtub at the hotel,"" Chief Coroner Craig Harvey told reporters when he released the preliminary report last month. Investigators found ""a small spoon with a white crystal like substance in it and a rolled up piece of white paper"" in the bathroom where Houston drowned, coroner's investigator Kristy McCracken wrote. ""Remnants of a white powdery substance"" were found on a bathroom counter, McCracken wrote. ""I also collected remnants of a white powdery substance from out of a drawer and from the bottom of a mirror in the same drawer in the bathroom counter,"" she wrote. Detectives found a ""plethora of medications bottles"" in the hotel room, although the coroner concluded the prescription drugs ""did not contribute to the death."" Along with cocaine and Xanax, the toxicology tests found other drugs in her body, including marijuana, the muscle relaxant Flexeril and the allergy medicine Benadryl, the report said. Houston won six Grammys and sold 170 million albums, singles and videos over her career. In recent years, the singer's accomplishments were overtaken by her struggles with drug addiction.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate will hold its final vote on a sweeping health care bill Thursday morning under an agreement that Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday. The vote had been expected on the night of Christmas Eve due to Republican delay tactics to hold off the measure. Reid has insisted it be passed before Christmas. Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, decided on a timetable to vote on the health care bill and an extension of the federal debt limit on Thursday morning. First, the Senate will hold another procedural vote on the health care bill Wednesday to set up the final vote. This procedural vote will require support from all 60 members of Reid's Democratic caucus to overcome a Republican filibuster. The vote Thursday on final passage will need a simple majority of 51 in the 100-member chamber. Earlier Tuesday, Democrats cleared the second of the three key procedural hurdles on the sweeping $871 billion measure. The Senate voted 60-39 along party lines to adopt changes negotiated by Reid. The Senate also set a timetable for ending debate on the bill. Obama said Tuesday he would delay leaving for his Christmas holiday in Hawaii until the Senate holds its final vote on the bill. ""I will not leave until my friends in the Senate have completed their work,"" Obama said. ""My attitude is that if they're making these sacrifices to provide health care to all Americans, then the least I can do is be around to provide them any encouragement and last-minute help where necessary. That's the deal."" The first procedural vote early Monday virtually ensures the bill's final approval, but any measure the Senate passes still would have to be merged with the $1 trillion House version in what could be tough negotiations. ""Health care reform is not a matter of if,"" White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said, ""health care reform now is a matter of when."" Sen. Max Baucus, D-Montana, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, declared that ""the finish line is in sight."" ""We're not the first to attempt such reforms, but we will be the first to succeed,"" Baucus said. Republicans have mounted a fierce campaign against the bill, using procedural tricks to slow debate and casting the measure as an unnecessary government intrusion in health care that will raise costs. In remarks Tuesday on the Senate floor, Reid acknowledged the toxic political environment surrounding the nearly yearlong debate. Senators should set aside ""personal animosity,"" he said. ""There's a lot of tension in the Senate, but I would hope everyone would go back to their gentlemanly ways. ... Let's just all try to get along."" If a combined House-Senate health care bill wins final approval from Congress and Obama signs it, the measure would be the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid more than four decades ago. The influential American Medical Association, a traditional opponent of overhauling health care, endorsed the Senate measure hours after a rare 1 a.m. Monday vote to start winding down debate. Read CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta's take on the health care bill . To Democrats, Monday's vote signaled eventual victory on the Senate bill. ""The die is cast. It's done,"" Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, said. Watch how deals got the bill moving . Compromises made to win the backing of lawmakers such as Sens. Ben Nelson, D-Nebraska, and Joe Lieberman, a Connecticut independent, enraged many liberal Democrats and threatened to undermine support for the bill. Liberal Democrats are upset with Reid's decision to abandon a government-run public health insurance option and an expansion of Medicare to Americans as young as 55. But top Democrats argue the Senate bill still would constitute a positive change of historic proportions. The legislation would extend health insurance coverage to more than 30 million uninsured Americans while reducing the federal deficit, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The House and Senate bills agree on a broad range of changes that could affect every American's coverage. Among other things, they have agreed to subsidize insurance for a family of four making up to roughly $88,000 annually, or 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Watch how the health care overhaul could affect you . They also have agreed to create health insurance exchanges designed to make it easier for small businesses, the self-employed and the unemployed to pool resources and purchase less expensive coverage. Both the House plan and the Senate bill eventually would limit total out-of-pocket expenses and prevent insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. Insurers also would be barred from charging higher premiums based on a person's gender or medical history. However, both bills allow insurance companies to charge higher premiums for older customers. Medicaid would be significantly expanded under both proposals. The House bill would extend coverage to individuals earning up to 150 percent of the poverty level, or roughly $33,000 for a family of four; the Senate plan ensures coverage to those earning up to 133 percent of the poverty level, or just more than $29,000 for a family of four. Major differences between the bills would be the focus of a conference committee that would try to merge them. One of the biggest divides is over how to pay for the plans. The House package is financed through a combination of a tax surcharge on wealthy Americans and Medicare spending reductions. Specifically, individuals with annual incomes more than $500,000 -- as well as families earning more than $1 million -- would face a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge. The Senate bill also cuts Medicare by roughly $500 billion. But instead of an income tax surcharge on the wealthy, it would impose a 40 percent tax on insurance companies providing what are called ""Cadillac"" health plans valued at more than $8,500 for individuals and $23,000 for families. Proponents of the tax on high-end plans argue it's one of the most effective ways to curb medical inflation. However, House Democrats oppose taxing such policies because it would hurt union members who traded higher salaries for more generous health benefits. The Senate bill also would hike Medicare payroll taxes on families making more than $250,000; the House bill does not. Another key sticking point is the dispute over a public option. The House plan includes a public option; the Senate plan would instead create new nonprofit private plans overseen by the federal government. Individuals under both plans would be required to purchase coverage, but the House bill includes more stringent penalties for most of those who fail to comply. The House bill would impose a fine of up to 2.5 percent of an individual's income. The Senate plan would require individuals to purchase health insurance coverage or face a fine of up to $750 or 2 percent of his or her income -- whichever is greater. Both versions include a hardship exemption for poorer Americans. iReport.com: Give your thoughts on the Senate health care bill . Employers face a much stricter mandate under the House legislation, which would require companies with a payroll of more than $500,000 to provide insurance or pay a penalty of up to 8 percent of their payroll. The Senate bill would require companies with more than 50 employees to pay a fee of up to $750 per worker if any of their employees rely on government subsidies to purchase coverage. Abortion also has been a sticking point for both chambers. A late compromise with Catholic and other conservatives in the House led to the adoption of an amendment banning most abortion coverage from the public option. It would also prohibit abortion coverage in private policies available in the exchange to people receiving federal subsidies. Senate provisions, made more conservative than initially drafted to satisfy Nelson, would allow states to choose whether to ban abortion coverage in plans offered in the exchanges. Individuals purchasing plans through the exchanges would have to pay for abortion coverage out of their own funds.

"Madrid (CNN) -- More than 70 people were injured in clashes in Madrid on Wednesday as Spanish police used rubber bullets and batons to disperse anti-austerity protesters, witnesses and emergency workers said. Protesters, including a group of miners who have marched on the capital, are demonstrating against Spain's government and the cuts it is imposing as it seeks to curb the country's debt crisis. Hundreds of people quickly moved out of the area as police moved in, with witnesses reporting the use of rubber bullets and batons by officers. Madrid's ambulance service said 76 people were injured in clashes at or near the Industry Ministry. Miners were among the 43 protesters who were injured, and 33 police also were hurt. Eight are receiving hospital treatment, but the injuries are not serious, the ambulance service said. A number of miners reached Madrid on Tuesday night after taking part in what has been dubbed the ""Black March,"" covering 450 kilometers (280 miles) over the course of two-and-a-half weeks. They were joined by thousands of other miners and supporters in a large protest Tuesday night and another demonstration Wednesday outside the Industry Ministry. The miners are protesting a 64% cut in the government subsidy to the mining sector this year, from 301 million euros to 111 million euros. Unions say this endangers the jobs of 8,000 miners and 22,000 auxiliary jobs that serve mining regions where 200,000 people live and depend on mines. The clashes came as Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced an increase in the country's general sales tax from 18% to 21%, as well as spending reductions that include cutting employment benefits after six months. Announcing the measures to lawmakers, Rajoy said they would slash the budget by 65 billion euros ($80 billion) over two-and-a-half years. The European Commission welcomed the move, saying it was an ""important step"" toward Spain meeting its deficit target for the year, Spain's Efe news agency said. Spain's economic crisis also has worsened since last year. The nation has slipped back into a recession; the unemployment rate has risen to 24% overall, and more than 50% for those under age 25; and the government has already enacted billions of dollars in austerity cuts, along with some tax hikes, to reduce the budget deficit.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama met Tuesday with Senate Democrats and emerged to say Congress was ""on the precipice"" of passing a sweeping health care reform bill. ""There are some differences that still have to be worked on,"" Obama said after talks with Democrats trying to push their bill through the Senate. But ""there is broad consensus around [a set of] reforms."" Obama spoke after Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman indicated he was prepared to back reform legislation on condition that the bill drops both a controversial government-run public health insurance option and a provision allowing 55- to 64-year-olds to buy into Medicare. If the public option and Medicare buy-in are removed from the bill, ""then I'm going to be in a position where I can say ... that I'm ready to vote for health care reform,"" Lieberman told reporters on Capitol Hill. In a later interview with CNN, Lieberman said he was ""moving very much in the direction of saying yes, pending just seeing what I've been told is happening with the bill."" An independent who caucuses with the Democrats, Lieberman has emerged as the main obstacle to the majority party's efforts to get the health care bill passed by the Senate before Christmas. He threatened over the weekend to join a GOP filibuster if the legislation contains either the public option or the Medicare expansion. Unanimous Republican opposition to health care legislation so far means Senate Democrats need the backing of all 60 members of their caucus to end debate on the bill and move to a final vote. Final Senate passage of the bill would then require only a simple majority of 51 votes. Senate Democrats held an emergency meeting Monday night to discuss the issue, then gathered with Obama on Tuesday afternoon to hear the president's opinion. ""The final bill won't include everything that everybody wants. No bill can do that,"" Obama said afterward. ""But what I told my former colleagues today is that we simply cannot allow differences over individual elements of this plan to prevent us from meeting our responsibility to solve a longstanding and urgent problem for the American people."" Obama insisted ""any fair reading"" of the Senate bill showed it meets the administration's criteria of lowering costs and expanding coverage while not adding to the federal deficit. Some Democrats disagreed. Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean -- a former presidential candidate and past head of the Democratic National Committee -- ripped the decision to eliminate the public option and the Medicare expansion. ""This is essentially the collapse of health care reform in the United States Senate and, honestly, the best thing to do right now is kill the Senate bill and go back to the House,"" Dean said in an interview with Vermont Public Radio posted on its Web site. In his interview with CNN, Lieberman acknowledged he angered some of his colleagues, but said he was acting on principle, not politics. ""I knew some of them were upset about positions I'd taken,"" Lieberman said. ""But like each of them, I didn't get elected by telling my voters in Connecticut that I would follow the majority of my caucus even if I thought on some things they were wrong. We each have to do what we think is right."" Political differences require compromise, even within the Democratic caucus, Lieberman said. ""In a group of 60 senators, achieving ideological uniformity is impossible because the country is too big and we represent too many people,"" he said. Before the meeting with Obama, liberal Sens. Tom Harkin of Iowa and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia indicated that the Medicare buy-in would likely be dropped. While they didn't like the idea, they suggested they would support a health care bill anyway. Democrats ""may have to do what Mr. Lieberman wants,"" Harkin told CNN. Lieberman supported letting older workers buy into Medicare in 2000, when he was the Democratic vice presidential candidate, and as recently as September in comments to a Connecticut newspaper. Now, he said both Monday and Tuesday, the country has huge deficits -- as opposed to a budget surplus nine years ago -- and Medicare is poised to run out of money in 2017. The Medicare buy-in was part of a package of provisions announced by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid last week as an alternative to a public option, which lacked enough support among Democrats to break a GOP filibuster. Negotiated by a team of 10 Democratic senators -- five liberal and five moderate -- the compromise package had been hailed by Reid, Obama and others as an important step forward in the health care debate. The package also would allow private insurers to offer nonprofit health coverage overseen by the government. But many senators have reserved judgment on the compromise proposal until the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office provides its analysis of how much it costs. The CBO estimate was expected to be completed as soon as Tuesday. Most Democrats have supported the public option as a nonprofit competitor to private insurers that would expand coverage and bring down prices. Republicans and some moderate Democrats, along with the health insurance industry -- one of the major employers in Lieberman's home state -- oppose a public option, calling it a first step toward a government takeover of the U.S. health care system. ""I haven't received any pressure from the insurance companies,"" Lieberman insisted Tuesday. ""I mean it. Periodically, they'll talk to my staff about one thing or another, but ... I've never hesitated to take on the insurance companies."" Another potential obstacle for Reid is moderate Democrat Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who said Sunday said he cannot support the Senate bill without tighter restrictions on federal funding for abortion. The Senate last week defeated an amendment proposed by Nelson and two other senators that would adopt tougher language on abortion funding contained in the House health care bill. A compromise on the abortion language is possible, said Nelson, one of the 10 Senate Democrats who negotiated in private last week. If the Senate eventually passes a health care bill, its version will have to be merged with the version the House of Representatives passed in November, which includes a public health insurance plan. The final bill would then need approval from both chambers before going to Obama to be signed into law. Obama and Democratic leaders have said they want the bill completed this year. The Senate would need to finish its work this week to leave a realistic chance of meeting that schedule.

"London (CNN) -- Rupert Murdoch can be expected to be personally furious and potentially devastated by the partisan-but-damning judgment of a committee of British lawmakers that he is not a ""fit"" person to run an international business. This choice of wording is powerful for two reasons: One immediately damaging to News Corporation and its ambitions to take full control of the prize asset of British Sky Broadcasting, and the second personally damaging for the 81-year-old Murdoch. To hold a broadcasting license in Britain the corporation controlling the television station must itself pass a test that its executives are ""fit and proper."" Within minutes of the parliamentary Culture Media and Sport Committee publishing its judgment about Rupert Murdoch's behavior and deeper condemnation of the culture at News Corporation the British regulator of television and broadcasting, Ofcom, reiterated in response to a query that it is investigating his status as a leading shareholder in BSkyB. The committee's words -- made publicly and with the protection of parliamentary privilege from legal action by Murdoch or News Corp -- also take Murdoch back decades to one of the greatest rivalries of his career with the late Czech-born publishing magnate Robert Maxwell. Critics often compared Maxwell and Murdoch in the same sentence, something Murdoch is known to hate since he saw Maxwell while alive as a charlatan. Maxwell's death led to even greater revelations that he was also at the head of a conspiracy to defraud staff pension-funds controlled by his companies. No one has suggested Murdoch is guilty of financial misconduct in the current controversy which has spanned illegal telephone hacking, alleged corruption of police and civil servants and undue influence over politicians. Murdoch, who values his personal reputation for probity as much as he honors the memory of his father Keith as a campaigning journalist and newspaper proprietor, will not miss the similarity of the language used by the select committee in Tuesday's judgment and that used by then Board of Trade's damning judgment in 1971 that Maxwell was ""unfit"" to run a public company. That judgment hung heavily on Maxwell's reputation for the rest of his life. Of course, Maxwell did go on to run a major public company, which after his mysterious death at sea off his luxury yacht in November 1991 was found to have taken more than ÃÂ£400 million ($648 million) from staff pension funds in attempts to prop up its failing businesses. Those who forced the tough language through into the committee report will have been in no doubt that the comparison with Maxwell would be made by those with long memories -- no more so the trade unionists Murdoch stomped on and the right-wing establishment he disdained -- and how much it would sting Murdoch. Labour and Liberal Democrat members of the select committee forced the ""not fit"" judgment through the minority of their Conservative committee colleagues though the other stinging criticisms of News Corporation were unanimous including that it had been misled by News Corp executives. The report has no legal force but comes with the stamp of parliamentary authority and follows many months of investigation and open hearings, including with Rupert and his son James. Based on two major biographies, it is clear that Murdoch is known to loathe any parallel between himself and Maxwell. The words of the select committee will bring that into sharp relief, providing ammunition to a section of the British establishment which has never liked the Australian publisher and seen him as polluting their vision of British life. For his part, Murdoch has historically relished taking on the effete of Britain, variously accusing them of wanting to turn the country into a museum and recently portraying the crisis swirling around him as the work of ""enemies many different agendas, but worst old toffs and right-wingers who still want last century's status quo with their monopolies."" Despite now perhaps actually being the establishment, Murdoch still sees himself as the ""Aussie battler"" against entrenched interest groups, particularly in the highly class-based British establishment. He is likely to see the damning select committee report -- with its strong language forced through by trade-union-backed Labour politicians with a visceral dislike of his power and wealth -- in the same terms but the comparison with a crook like Maxwell will infuriate and hurt him. And this report is only the latest wave in an ongoing tsunami of bad news. News Corp and Murdoch still have to face months of further revelations about telephone hacking at the News of the World, over-close relationships with police and civil servants and his empire and the embarrassing exposure of just how close relationships were between News and politicians of all major parties in Britain.","UK media regulator Ofcom says it is investigating Murdoch's status as a leading shareholder in BSkyB .

"(CNN) -- On the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, nestled along Guanabara Bay and within sight of the iconic Christ the Redeemer statue, one of the world's largest open-air landfills has closed after more than three decades of operation. The landfill, known as Jardim Gramacho or Gramacho Gardens, is piled almost 300 feet high across 14 million square feet -- the equivalent of 244 American football fields. It is the largest landfill in Brazil and all of South America. Built in the late 1970s, it received close to 8,000 tons of trash daily, 70% of all the trash in the Rio metro area. The closure comes less than three weeks before the United Nations' RIO+20 summit, where world representatives will gather to take a direct look at sustainable solutions for the Earth's environment. The move also comes in advance of Rio's preparations to host the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics. It's part of a continuing effort led by Rio's state environment minister to close all of the area's five official open-air landfills -- as well as an unknown number of clandestine ones -- by 2014. Brazil tries to balance farming and forests . The landfills are giving way to more modern treatment facilities designed to reduce their environmental impact. In Jardim Gramacho's case, the daily trash will now go to Seropedica, which the government says is the most advanced treatment plant in Latin America. It's designed to curb production of greenhouse gases and pollution of the Guanabara Bay marshes. According to the city of Rio, the sludge from the decomposing trash will be treated and turned into recycled water, and escaping methane will be harvested. At Jardim Gramacho, about 75 million cubic meters of methane gas will be collected over the next 15 years. The Brazilian petroleum company Petrobras will purchase the gas and use it to run one of its refineries. After 15 years, the landfill will be turned into a park, officials say. At the turn of the century, complaints arose that Guanabara Bay was not safe for bathing because of contaminants leaching from Jardim Gramacho. The city announced the closing of the landfill several times but always postponed it until now. Part of the proceeds from the methane sales will go toward rehabilitating the drug-infested slums, or favelas, that have sprung up around the landfill. Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes sees the closing of the landfill as an end to ""the crime that Rio has committed for the last 40 years."" At its peak, Jardim Gramacho had about 5,000 catadores, people who spend their days scouring landfills for plastic, paper, wood, metal and anything else that can be sold to recycling companies. Their numbers have dwindled to about 2,000 as business at the landfill has wound down, city officials said, and now there is concern about their future. These workers, whose ages range from 16 to 87, have been depicted by many media outlets and were featured in Vik Muniz's Oscar-nominated 2010 documentary ""Waste Land."" The film helped raise funds for the catadores, whose work supports close to 15,000 residents near the landfill, according to government estimates, and is responsible for much of the city's recycling. According to Brazil's environment ministry, only 18% of the entire country's recycling is done as part of a formal program. That means most recycling is done by catadores. The president of the Jardim Gramacho Cooperative of Collectors, Sebastian Carlos dos Santos, notes that there are about 1 million catadores all across Brazil. ""This is a promising market that needs to be a humanized form of work,"" he said. Catadores at Jardim Gramacho generally earn about the Brazilian minimum wage, roughly $268 U.S. dollars a month. But in many cases, they can bring home twice as much. According to the city of Rio, the cooperative and city officials negotiated more than $11 million as severance to be split among those workers who could prove they had been working at the site for the last few years. The severance, paid by the company responsible for the harvesting of the methane gas, is being paid to more than 1,600 workers. How loggers are helping replant rain forests . The cooperative was also able to negotiate with the state government to set up a fund that will, for the next 14 years, provide funding for projects to educate the workers and provide them with tools to continue the job of recycling. The fund will also pay for classes if workers want to pursue another trade or career. Catadores often work in dangerous conditions and receive no benefits. They are frequent victims of diseases such as dengue fever, spread by mosquitoes that breed in the landfill's stagnant water, as well as respiratory ailments and infections attributable to rats, birds and other vermin. In addition, medical waste from all the hospitals in the area was dumped at Jardim Gramacho. The workers can seek treatment at state hospitals through Brazil's precarious public health system. The closing of the landfills is bittersweet to these workers. The cooperative and its members know this is a step forward in rebuilding and conserving Rio's environment, but for many, this also means their only source of income has gone down the drain. Severina Alzira Silva, 87, is described in the cooperative's blog as one of the oldest pickers working in the Gramacho landfill. She's worked there for more than 30 years, has nine children and is illiterate. ""I fear for my future, because I need to keep working,"" she said in one post.","A Rio de Janeiro dump, the largest in South America, is closing after three decades .
Drug-ridden slums, informal economy grew up around Jardim Gramacho .
Thousands of scavengers, called catadores, made their living off recycling trash there .

"(CNN) -- Americo Lopes, a New Jersey construction worker who scored a Mega Millions lottery jackpot in 2009, tried to cheat his fellow workers out of their share of the pool by claiming the ticket as exclusively his own, a jury has ruled. Five other construction workers based in Elizabeth, New Jersey, will share the jackpot after a state court ruled unanimously that Lopes had fraudulently claimed the entire bounty. The $38.5 million ticket amounted to $24 million after Lopes chose the cash option. The plaintiffs were identified as Candido Silva Jr., Carlos Fernandes, Daniel Esteves, Candido Silva Sr. and Jose Sousa, according to court spokeswoman Sandra Thaler-Gerber. They are expected to be awarded about $2 million each, after taxes and attorneys' fees, she said. ""They feel vindicated,"" said attorney Rubin M. Sinins, who said the group of workers had chipped in on the pool since 2007. New Jersey's The Star-Ledger newspaper reported that Lopes responded to the ruling by saying ""They robbed me."" His wife, Margarida, added that ""justice was not served today,"" the newspaper reported. After scoring the winning ticket, Lopes apparently told his boss at Berto Construction Inc. that he needed extended time off because of foot surgery, according to testimony.","Five other construction workers based in Elizabeth, New Jersey, will share the jackpot .

"(CNN) -- As I walked the streets of New York the other day, I saw several white youths with hoodies, tattoos and nose rings. Not one time did it enter my mind that they could be skinheads. While walking into the Howard University Hospital in Washington earlier that day, a few African-Americans rocked various types of hoodies. There wasn't a knot in my stomach; I didn't cross the street out of fear, and no, I didn't nervously look around for a cop or two. As a native of Houston, I grew up in a black neighborhood. Went to a black church. Attended mostly black schools. I've seen every kind of black person possible. The drug dealer. The doctor. The bully. The postal worker. The crack addict. The city councilman. And never have I walked in fear of black folks who have given me no reason to be scared. Oh, let's be clear, I've seen a group of menacing looking black folks who scared the hell out of me. But I can say the same for whites, Hispanics and Asians. What the Trayvon Martin shooting should tell us is that the stereotypes that we have of people can have deadly consequences. Martin was nothing more than a young man wearing athletic shoes, jeans and a hoodie. For George Zimmerman, that's the uniform of a suspicious person. And it apparently was that simple observation that led Zimmerman to follow Martin in his car, get out, confront Martin and eventually shoot him fatally. It has been amazing to listen to the reaction of some folks. But nothing got me more charged up than hearing Geraldo Rivera say on ""Fox and Friends"" that by wearing a hoodie, Martin contributed to his own death. ""When you see a kid walking down the street, particularly a dark-skinned kid like my son Cruz Ã¢â¬â who I constantly yelled at when he was going out wearing a damn hoodie or those pants around his ankles. 'Take that hood off!' People look at you and what's the instant identification, what's the instant association? It's those crime scene surveillance tapes,"" Rivera said. ""Every time you see someone stickin' up a 7-11, the kid's wearing a hoodie. Every time you see a mugging on a surveillance camera or they get the old lady in the alcove, it's a kid wearing a hoodie. You have to recognize that this whole stylizing yourself as a 'gangsta.' ... You're gonna be a gangsta wanna? Well, people are going to perceive you as a menace. That's what happens. It is an instant reflexive action."" He later added, ""When you see a black or Latino youngster, particularly on the street, you walk to the other side of the street. You try to avoid that confrontation. Trayvon Martin, you know, God bless him, he was an innocent kid, a wonderful kid, a box of Skittles in his hands. He didn't deserve to die. But I'll bet you money, if he didn't have that hoodie on, that nutty neighborhood watch guy wouldn't have responded in that violent and aggressive way."" He might have thought he was well-meaning, but Geraldo, that's just nonsense. It wasn't Trayvon's hoodie that led to his death; it was the skin color. It was what was going through Zimmerman's mind when he saw the kid. We do a disservice to ourselves when we try to explain away such nonsense. In a show of solidarity, all the Miami Heat took a photo wearing the team's hoodies, with their hands stuffed in their pockets. The leader of this effort was my good friend, Dwyane Wade. Wade also posted a picture of himself in a hoodie on his Facebook page and linked to it from Twitter tagged with ""#hoodies #stereotypes #trayvonmartin"" ""I'm a father,"" Wade told the South Florida Sun Sentinel. ""It's support of the tragic thing that has taken place. No matter what color, race, we're all fathers."" The problem today is that minorities, especially men -- black men -- have long had to make accommodations for the negative view others have of us. See, it doesn't matter about our degrees. Our fine, tailored suits don't matter. We've made all the accommodations to fit into this society. We've cut our hair. We are careful about the clothes we wear. We change how we talk so as not to sound threatening. We're fine, upstanding citizens. Yet we still are seen as suspicious. And in the case of Trayvon Martin, end up dead. We are sick and tired of being seen as suspicious. We are sick and tired of being seen as a stereotype and not as a full human being. We are sick and tired of having to give our black boys ""the talk"" and still having to bury them so young. As civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer stated so well: ""We are sick and tired of being sick and tired."" For those who continue to tout this so-called post-racial America, look at the image of Trayvon Martin. You tell his parents that the age of Obama is a post-racial America. You tell his parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, that their son was judged by the content of his character and not the color of his skin. Even President Barack Obama said on Friday that the killing of Trayvon Martin requires a national ""soul-searching."" ""If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,"" President Obama said. America, no more. We will no longer accommodate your easily bruised feelings by clenching our teeth and praying it will all get better. No more. What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now. If you think for a moment that we will be satisfied with a police chief stepping down or press releases expressing outrage, you have another think coming. This, folks, is war. This is war on racism. This is war on bigotry. This is war on stereotypes. This is a call to arms. This is time for the soldiers in the battle for social justice to stand up and say, ""I report for duty, sir."" This fight will not become just a moment. We will not let that happen. This incident is about a movement. A movement for respect. A movement for decency. A movement to be treated equally, and not be stalked and stereotyped because of the amount of melanin in our skin. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Martin: Stereotypes that we have of people can have deadly consequences .

"(EW.com) -- A pregnant Nicole ""Snooki"" Polizzi has moved out of the house. Mike ""The Situation"" Sorrentino has sworn off drinking. Deena Cortese and Jenni ""JWoww"" Farley have committed to monogamous relationships. The wildest cast in reality TV is starting to seem downright ... grown up. What's ""Jersey Shore"" coming to? ""They're starting to take those next steps into adulthood,"" says MTV's executive VP of programming and head of production, Chris Linn, giving the network's first interview about the sixth season of the reality megahit. ""What's going to be different this season is how much their lives had changed."" Last week, the cast reunited in Seaside Heights after an 11-month hiatus. That's the longest production break ever between ""Shore"" seasons. After spending a few days in the ""Shore"" house, last night Snooki made good on her threats to leave and moved next door. MTV notes it's not the first time a cast member has exited the house during production. ""It's not a prison,"" Linn says of the ""Shore"" house. ""I know she's concerned about the perception of her being a pregnant woman in a party house. I think that's a common experience among a group of friends when somebody gets pregnant. This is an opportunity to see how she deals with it and how the rest of the house deals with it. The show has always been about following what's really happening in their lives."" ""Shore"" executive producer SallyAnn Salsano, who's currently on location at Seaside, says the production always has a back-up location in case there's a serious meltdown at the main ""Shore"" residence. But obviously the network and producers prefer to keep the cast under the same roof. ""The house is not the party,"" Salsano says. ""It's a free-standing, innocent object. It's whatever the people do inside that's the atmosphere that's created."" Unlike recent years, only one season of ""Shore"" is scheduled for production this year and MTV has a lot riding on it. Even after last season's ratings dip, the series remains a basic-cable phenomenon, averaging 7.6 million viewers. MTV hopes the extended hiatus will result in an exciting season compared to, for instance, season 5, which was shot back-to-back with Italy. ""The show has surprised us in the past and we're super excited about this season,"" Linn says. ""I wouldn't make any assumptions about what the season will do."" The executive says the network has been fully supportive of all the changes in the lives of its ""Shore"" cast, even if it means less on-screen partying. ""I don't think anybody expected Snooki to be the one to blaze that trail, but she is, and it's going to change the dynamic with everybody else,"" Linn says. ""She's just as funny, if not funnier, than she's ever been."" There have admittedly been some adjustments to accommodate Snooki's pregnancy, he says. ""At one point they had talked about going skydiving, so she's not going to be jumping out of a plane."" As for The Situation, who reportedly went to rehab for a prescription drug problem and is now swearing off alcohol, Linn notes, ""drinking was never a problem for him. He's taking steps to be as healthy as possible and we support that."" Salsano likewise promises the upcoming season will be just as entertaining as in the past, just ""a different kind of entertaining."" So far on the set, there's been plenty of joking around about Snooki's pregnancy and Mike's sobriety. Says Salsano: ""It's like a high school sex-ed video gone insane."" See the full story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- When my wife woke me up before dawn about three months ago to tell me she was having contractions, one of the first things I did was grab my iPhone from the nightstand. No, I wasn't ignoring my wife to check my e-mail or send a tweet. I picked up my smartphone so I could use a 99-cent app to track the duration and frequency of those contractions. You might think that using apps and gadgets right before and after your child is born will take away from this life-changing experience. But for my wife and me, having the right tech tools enhanced the experience and made us feel more connected to our out-of-town friends and family. Here are five tech tools that have come in handy for this new dad. LaborMate iPhone app (99 cents) Each time my wife signaled that a contraction was starting, I tapped the app's start button and when it was over, I hit stop -- generating a report that made it easy to track her progress. I could e-mail that data to our OBGYN, or if I was really bold, share it on Twitter or Facebook. Using the app provided some order and calmness to what is often a chaotic experience. Total Baby iPhone app ($4.99) After our son Jack was born and we settled into the hospital room, nurses started coming in and peppering us with questions: How many times did the baby pee today? When was the last time he ate? Were you able to breastfeed? For how long? Are you sure this is your baby? (kidding). Once we left the hospital, there were more questions. And they got harder. At the first pediatrician visit, the doctor wanted daily totals for the number of dirty and wet diapers as well as more details on the frequency and length of breast- or bottle-feeding sessions. What were his height, weight and length at birth? When he left the hospital? Total Baby makes it easy to keep track of every dirty diaper, bottle, nap and even bath. As a new parent, it's easy to obsess over these early details, and while this app can feed that obsession, it put me at ease to know that all the vital information about my son was only a few taps away. We also used the app to keep track of upcoming and past doctor's appointments, to write down questions for the doctor and track Jack's growth. Since I always carry my iPhone with me, I use the app to document milestones like Jack's first bath or the first time he smiled. Each entry automatically records the date and time, and you can add a photo to go with it. One of the best things about the app is if you download it on multiple iPhones or iPads, you can use your home Wi-Fi network to sync the data. We downloaded it on two iPhones and an iPad, so regardless of which gadget we use to update the app, it only takes a few seconds to sync so we have the latest data on all of our devices. Apple iPad (starts at $499) After more than two months as the father of a newborn, I'm now convinced that Steve Jobs had new parents in mind when he designed the iPad 2. There are many nights where my son won't fall asleep unless he's cradled in the crook of my arm. That leaves me with one free hand -- not enough to flip through a book or use a laptop. The iPad is the perfect size and shape to balance on my lap or chair armrest and manipulate with my free hand. My iPad has become my mobile command center to entertain and inform myself and to share news and photos of my son with friends and family. I'll catch up on news and social-networking feeds through apps like CNN, New York Times, Twitter and Flipboard. When I want to watch TV without disturbing the baby, I'll plug in my headphones and use apps such as HBO GO, SlingPlayer, CNN and ABC. And of course like any new parent, I'll use Google to get answers to burning questions like ""Why does my baby have hiccups?"" or ""When does the umbilical cord fall off?"" The iPad is also great for storing and displaying pictures. When relatives visited, I set the iPad to slideshow mode and propped it upon the living room table to use as a digital picture frame. To make loading photos onto the iPad easier, I bought the $29 iPad Camera Connection Kit to transfer photos and videos from an SD card and my iPhone. It's easier than dumping photos onto a computer, but you will need two hands. Web Albums iPhone/iPad app ($1.99) Like any new parent, I was eager to share photos of our son on Facebook, but I didn't always have my computer handy. There's no official Facebook iPad app (yet), and the iPhone app only lets you upload one photo at a time. The Web Albums app for iPhone and iPad lets me upload batches of photos to Facebook at the same time and create and easily manage my Facebook photo albums. The app also let me upload multiple photos and manage albums on Google's Picasa service. It even saves photos for offline viewing and the app features a nice slideshow function. Amazon Mom & Subscribe & Save . We heard lots of opinions on the best place to buy diapers and other baby stuff. We joined Amazon's free but unfortunately named Amazon Mom club (the account is in my name) to get discounts on lots of stuff. For diapers and wipes, we signed up for Amazon's subscription service called ""Subscribe & Save."" The service delivers items to your door at set intervals of your choosing. You can cancel at anytime or change the type of diapers or wipes. For instance, with the Amazon Mom discount, a shipment of 234 Pampers diapers costs about $31, or 13 cents a diaper. That's about $12 less than Target.com. What are your favorite apps and tech tools for new parents? Post a comment and let us know.

"(CNN) -- Memorial Day is here and millions of Americans will be hitting the road to see family and friends, take a breather away from home. And luckily, after months of sky-high gas prices at the pump, they will find lower gas prices. Let's be grateful for this relief, even as we know prices can shoot back up with little warning -- as they did earlier in the spring -- bringing an unwelcome economic sting on top of the already tough situation many families are facing. There's not a lot we can do about the yo-yo-ing cost of gas; unlike a lot of folks in Washington, I don't claim to have a quick solution. But I do know what hasn't worked. We've drilled-baby-drilled for a while now. In fact, domestic oil production is at its highest levels in almost a decade. Still, prices this year seemed headed towards 4 dollars a gallon. We seem to have these freaky price hikes every few years. What is abundantly clear in 2012 is that all this drilling can't guarantee cheap gas. This recent drop in gas prices makes the point even more starkly: Gas prices and U.S. drilling have little to do with each other. Statistical analysis shows that more oil production in the United States does not mean lower prices at the pump. Oil is a global commodity and U.S. production has only a tiny influence on supply. Despite record U.S. oil production, crude prices began 2012 with record prices around the nation and softened sharply this month. Economists say a strengthening dollar, signs of a slowing global economy and other factors are responsible, but this does little to quiet the voices on the right saying the only real way to relieve our stress as we fill up is to open up even more land and sea to drilling. Even the University of Chicago put out survey results showing that 92% of economists interviewed agreed that in the last decade our gas prices had been affect more by market factors than by American energy policy. This analysis makes sense, because despite the repetitive rhetoric you hear every time we start having a gas price crunch, the laws of supply and demand do not start and stop at the U.S. border. Oil is a globally traded commodity and while we consume more of it than any other country on the planet, we don't produce enough to affect its price. That is the sad state of affairs, folks. There is only one way off this merry-go-round, and it's to stop using so much oil. We need to quit this addiction that damages our economy, our security and our environment. This won't happen tomorrow, but it is starting to happen. We can move beyond oil using new, cost-effective technologies. Oil consumption is down in this country. And the trend is going to speed up now that stricter vehicle efficiency standards are coming into effect. This means that we can have fuel-efficient cars that look and drive great. But we need to pick up the pace. Instead of policies that increase our addiction to oil, we need policies that increase our transportation choices, not limit them to oil and gas. But that isn't happening in Congress right now. Just look at the political storm around the transportation bill, which is essential not just for roads and bridges, but also the robust mass-transit programs that keep our cities moving. Unfortunately, even though Congress is grappling with the deficit, it can't even agree to end billions in tax breaks and subsidies to the oil industry, let alone fund fuel and transportation alternatives appropriately. Legislation from Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, would have ended some of the $4 billion in annual tax breaks to the oil industry and directed new revenues to clean energy research and development -- were it not blocked by heavy Big Oil lobbying. So this weekend as you fill up to head to the beach, ask yourself if you want to be standing at the pump shaking your head during the next gas price shock wondering why we didn't start moving down the right road when the opportunity presented itself in 2012. Or do you want to act now? I know what I choose. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Maria Cardona.","Maria Cardona: Gas prices low ahead of holiday weekend, but we know it can change quickly .

"(CNN) -- The world saw him first blackened and bloated, his body marred by cuts, bruises and shrapnel that sliced through his flesh. That was a decade ago, when Peter Hughes was one of many Australian vacationers in the Indonesian island resort of Kuta. It had been just after 11 p.m., as he was about to reach for his Bintang beer at bustling Paddy's Bar, that the first of three bombs blew up. Hughes figures the suicide bomber must have been just a few feet from him. He felt a woman crashing into him. He saw dust, embers and then everything went black and silent. ""There was a moment there where it seemed nothing was happening,"" he recalled. Until the second bomb. Hughes was struggling to get out of Paddy's when a car bomb went off at a nearby nightclub. A third bomb went off later, near the U.S. Consulate in Renon, a suburb of Denpasar, police said. His body was 50 percent burned. His left calf was blown off. A shard of glass had lodged in his stomach. Cameras captured Hughes' ordeal. ""I couldn't feel the pain because of the shock,"" he said. In hospital, Hughes fell into a coma for almost three weeks and went into cardiac arrest three times. But he survived. He learned to walk again, talk again. To smell. To taste. But he will never fully recover, he said. How could anyone after something like that? Now 52, he goes on with his construction business in Perth. And he's become a motivational speaker and written a book, ""Back From the Dead."" Thursday, Hughes awaited news of the fate of Umar Patek, an Indonesian man accused of assembling the bombs used in the 2002 Bali attacks. Three of the bombing masterminds -- Imam Samudra, Amrozi bin Nurhasyim and Ali Ghufron -- were executed in 2008. Hughes wished the same sentence for Patek. ""Look, he's the highest level of criminal, I think,"" Hughes said. ""Someone who does something premeditated like that deserves the death penalty. He's not to be trusted."" When it was announced that Patek will serve 20 years in jail, Hughes was disappointed. At least the court found Patek guilty, Hughes said. ""We have to go along with the judges' ruling,"" he said. He hopes that Patek will not be treated very well in jail. That's what Hughes will cling to as he goes on with his life. As the 10th anniversary of the Bali bombings approaches, Hughes lives with the scars everyone can see. ""Sometimes it's a battle to prepare your body. If you go to the gym, when you go for a walk,"" he says. And then there are scars that are invisible, like the anxiety of being in crowded places. He reminds himself: ""I'm a lot better off than the people who died."" He laughs with the friends who also survived the Bali bombings. They understand. He's been back to Indonesia 25 times since 2002. He likes to confront his demons, not avoid them. But October 12, 2002, will forever be a marking point, like a huge blip that went off the charts of his life. ""It was heartbreaking,"" he said. It's a memory that no guilty verdict or punishment can ever make better. It will stay with him always.","Peter Hughes was badly injured and was in a coma for nearly three weeks .

"(CNN) -- Haiti has an opportunity to address the worst crimes of its past in prosecuting former dictator Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier, a leading human rights monitoring agency says. It is pressing for a full investigation and subsequent trial and urges the international community to lend resources to help fill gaps in Haiti's legal system. ""The Duvalier trial could be the most important criminal case in Haitian history,"" said Reed Brody, counsel for Human Rights Watch. ""The challenges for Haiti's weak justice system to carry out a fair trial are enormous, but international support can help Haiti meet those challenges."" In Quebec, Canada -- home to about 100,000 Haitians -- a new effort was launched this week to help victims of the Duvalier era to step forward with their stories. A newly formed survivors group, the Committee Against Impunity and for Justice in Haiti, plans to gather testimony that could be used as evidence in a potential criminal case. ""Certainly, it is difficult for anybody who suffered,"" said Matt Eisenbrandt, legal counsel for the Canadian Centre for International Justice, which is working on the project. ""But there are many people who feel the need for justice."" Human Rights Watch issued a 47-page report Thursday urging the international community to send temporary legal staff with experience in complex cases and to assist the Haitian government compile information through the release of diplomatic cables and other evidence. The group urged the Haitian government to provide a safe environment for witnesses and allow for judicial staff to work independently. Duvalier stunned the world by returning to Haiti in January after 25 years of exile in France. He stands accused of the abuse, torture and killings of Haitians during his 15 years of autocratic rule. Amnesty International gave Haitian authorities 100 documents that it says detail cases of detention without trial, systematic torture, disappearances and extrajudicial killings that took place between 1971 and 1986, when Duvalier was president. After Duvalier's return to Port-au-Prince, Haitian authorities reopened a 2008 corruption and embezzlement case against him based on allegations that he stole hundreds of millions of dollars from the national treasury. Human rights groups want Haitian authorities to bring him to trial for his alleged brutality also. Several Haitians have already filed criminal complaints against Duvalier. Michele Montas, a journalist and former spokeswoman for the United Nations secretary-general, said she endured threats and detention and survived an assassination attempt for her journalism. The staff at the independent radio station of her husband, Jean Dominique, was harassed and the station was shut down during Duvalier's rule, she said. She was expelled from the country in 1980 and returned only after Duvalier's ouster. ""We have enough proof,"" she told CNN in January. ""There are enough people who can testify. And what I will do is go to a public prosecutor, and there is a public prosecutor that could actually accommodate our complaints."" Dominique was slain in 2000. His daughter Nadine Dominique is one of the organizers of the victims group in Quebec. ""We were shocked when we heard the news that he had returned to Haiti,"" said Nadine Dominique. ""We all felt so strongly that we had to help bring him to justice, because without that, the Haitian people will never fully heal. You cannot move on without that closure."" Human Rights Watch says that under Duvalier's leadership, an extensive network of security forces exhibited a pattern of human rights abuses in order to enforce control. The report lists extrajudicial killings, detentions and ""savage torture"" of people between 1971 and 1986. ""In some cases, there is evidence that they acted under the direct order of Duvalier,"" the report says. Duvalier told reporters in January that he wanted to be in Haiti to help with rebuilding the country after last year's devastating earthquake. Brody said a fair trial for Duvalier could help the troubled Caribbean nation move forward and ""mark a break with the impunity that has characterized Haiti's past.""","Jean-Claude Duvalier returned from exile in January .

"(CNN) -- For the fourth weekend in a row, The Hunger Games easily led the domestic box office, holding off three new wide releases from the top spot. Lionsgate's $90 million blockbuster adaptation earned $21.5 million over the Friday-to-Sunday period, marking a slim 32 percent drop from last weekend. All told, The Hunger Games has earned $337.1 million after 24 days and seems headed for a final domestic total of about $375 million. The only other 2012 releases likely to reach those sorts of numbers are franchise films The Avengers, The Dark Knight Rises, and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Internationally, The Hunger Games isn't yet the franchise-launching blockbuster that it is Stateside, but it is performing quite well week-to-week. The film is nearing the $200 million mark overseas, and as of Sunday, its worldwide total stands at $531 million. That figure should only climb with each subsequent sequel. The Farrelly brothers' latest comedy, The Three Stooges, debuted in second place with an unexpectedly strong gross of $17.1 million. While that figure isn't gargantuan, the slapstick romp fared better with ticket buyers and critics than anyone expected, since ads for The Three Stooges, which highlighted the goofball physical comedy of the original 1930s film series, had many people thinking the film was a dud. Fox spent a reported $30 million on the comedy, which stars Sean Hayes, Will Sasso, and Chris Diamantopoulos, and marketed it to comedy-craving men and young boys eager for a family option other than Mirror Mirror. This strategy proved effective: according to CinemaScore, the film played to audiences that were 59 percent male. Stooges earned a lackluster ""B-"" CinemaScore grade, though â crowds under 25 gave the film an ""A-"" and crowds 25 and up gave it a ""C"" â which could hurt its box office longevity. Still, this should prove to be a minor winner for Fox. After three years on the shelf following MGM's demise, Joss Whedon's horror/comedy The Cabin in the Woods finally got its release, and over its debut weekend, the film scared up $14.9 million â a respectable result. Lionsgate faced a difficult challenge in marketing Cabin without giving away the film's plot, which is most effective when kept under wraps. Encouragingly, the film, which Lionsgate acquired for slightly less than $20 million, ticked up from $5.5 million on Friday to $5.7 million on Saturday â a rare increase for frontloaded horror films and fanboy flicks (Cabin is both of these things). This may have been the effect of strong word-of-mouth and stellar critical reviews overall (the film stands at 93 percent ""Fresh"" on Rotten Tomatoes), although audiences polled by CinemaScore didn't prove overly enthusiastic. They gave the film a harsh ""C"" grade. Increasingly, CinemaScore grades don't seem to line up with critical opinions â this recently happened with Drive, which critics loved, but audiences issued a ""C-"" grade. Only time will tell whether word-of-mouth proves a boon or an anchor for Cabin, but it has a shot at becoming a mid-level sleeper hit. In fourth place, Titanic 3D sank by only 33 percent to $11.6 million in its second weekend. After ten days, the 3-D re-release has pulled in $44.4 million, passing the re-release total of Star Wars: Episode I â The Phantom Menace, which earned $43.3 million total despite a strong $22.5 million start. Titanic should sail right past Beauty and the Beast 3D's $47.5 million gross over the next few days, and finish around $65 million. While that's lower than The Lion King's $94.2 million re-release total, and a bit less than many were expecting, Paramount spent just $18 million to convert the picture, so the the re-release will prove profitable â especially as a launching pad for the Titanic Blu-ray, set to hit stores soon. American Reunion rounded out the Top 5 with $10.7 million, a 50 percent decline from last weekend. Universal's sequel has grossed $39.9 million against a $50 million budget, but given steep drops like this one, Reunion will end up the lowest-grossing title in the American Pie franchise. Down in ninth place, Guy Pearce/Maggie Grace thriller Lockout started its run with a weak $6.3 million out of 2,308 theaters. The action film earned a ""B-"" CinemaScore grade. In limited release, Weinstein's buzzy documentary Bully, which finally got a PG-13 rating after cutting a few F-words, earned a moderate (given the amount of press it has received) $534,000 from 158 theaters. The film has earned $814,000 after three weekends. Meanwhile, Blue Like Jazz, the Kickstarter-funded adaptation of Donald Miller's religious memoir, grossed an okay $281,000 from 136 locations. Because Jazz was funded by fans, the Roadside Attractions-distributed feature has minimal negative costs. Among milestones, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island crossed $100 million domestically this weekend. The film, which stars The Rock, has earned over $315 million worldwide. Denzel Washington thriller Safe House passed $125 million. And 21 Jump Street reached $120 million, and is now set to pass The Vow as Channing Tatum's highest earner in 2012.

"(CNN) -- When Chelsea and Bayern Munich walk out onto the pitch at the Allianz Arena for Saturday's European Champions League final, it will mark the culmination of a competition rightly regarded as the finest -- and the hardest to win -- in club football. Some of the greatest teams in the world have fallen by the wayside in race for the prize: Jose Mourinho's Real Madrid and Alex Ferguson's Manchester United, to name but two. It was also the last bow for Pep Guardiola, arguably the greatest coach in charge of the greatest team of the modern era, who left Barcelona shortly after Champions League semifinal defeat against Chelsea. But it is much more than a match between the two best teams in Europe. It is also a clash of ideas over how football should best be run, and whether money and the success that statistically follows should trump the interests of the supporters. Bayern vs. Chelsea: Click here to see the finalists' vital statistics . On one hand you have Chelsea, a club which has benefited most from the financial liberalism of English football, an economic boom that followed the breakaway of the English Premier League two decades ago. England's laissez-faire economic approach meant that a young, unknown Russian oligarch who had only recently fallen in love with the beautiful game could purchase a club he had never visited and pump in hundreds of millions of dollars to secure trophies and league titles. Ticket prices rocketed as the game was gentrified, but Chelsea tasted real domestic success, winning three league titles, four FA Cups and two League Cups. On the other side is Bayern. Derided as ""FC Hollywood"" by some supporters of its Bundesliga rivals due to the Bavarian team's star-studded squad, it is still governed by the fan ownership model prevalent in Germany. The ""50+1"" rule prevents rich foreign and domestic businessmen from taking over clubs. Instead, the fans own the majority of the club (at least 50% plus one, hence the title). It keeps ticket prices low, and preserves the country's football culture while ensuring the stadiums are full. Anglo Saxon economics . Though the cheapest ticket for a top-grade match in Munich may well cost less than $20 -- compared to over $80 at Chelsea -- Bayern, and German clubs in general, have enjoyed far less success in Europe over the past decade compared to their English counterparts. ""In England, the change to football mirrored the wider free-market approach to business and the economy generally,"" argues David Conn, a journalist for British newspaper The Guardian and a staunch supporter of the German model of ownership. ""State-owned businesses were privatized, and the football clubs were bought, floated on the stock market or sold on, and the few people who owned the shares made a great deal of money for themselves. Ticket prices have risen by around 1,000% since. ""German football is flourishing with the highest crowds in Europe and Bayern in the final. Yet they had no similar money-obsessed change to the way they had always done things. Bayern has 13,500 standing places, at â¬15 ($20) each, for top games. ""That is a great beacon for the collective way of running football, and gives the lie to the Premier League argument that selling the clubs to overseas buyers, making them available for people to profit from, and unleashing ticket prices to maximize income is a necessary basis for success."" Premier League revolution . The introduction of the Premier League into English football in 1992 transformed everything. Before then, English football was dying under the weight of hooliganism and indifference. The 1989 Hillsborough tragedy, where 96 Liverpool fans standing during a match were crushed to death, also had a huge impact. The tragedy led to the Taylor Report, which recommended all-seater stadiums be made compulsory. In a stroke football found itself rebranded, with a new source of income thanks to Sky's pioneering purchase of the English game's television rights. But there was no mechanism to stop the rise of ticket prices to help pay for this bright new era of top-class players being paid six-figure weekly salaries. Nor was there any true barrier to who could own a club. Like any other business in the UK, a football team could be bought and sold by anyone who could borrow enough money. The global popularity made the Premier League popular to global businessmen and after Chelsea was sold to Roman Abramovich, the floodgates opened. Manchester City, which last weekend won the English title for the first time in 44 years, was bought in 2008 by Sheikh Mansour, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family. He in turn bought the club from former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Across the city, Manchester United was sold to the American Glazer family, owners of the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in a leveraged buyout -- essentially by borrowing money they didn't have. Currently half of the Premier League's 20 teams are in foreign hands attracted both to its popularity and also the huge numbers involved. Take the Premier League's latest figures. As many as five billion people watched the 2010-2011 season but it is the prize money that is even more surprising. According to the Sporting Intelligence blog Manchester City took home over Â£60 million ( close to $100 million) for the season, with over half of that figure is in mandatory payments from TV rights. The bottom team, Wolverhampton Wanderers, still secured Â£39.1 million ($61.9 million). The upside of money . Not everyone sees the downside of the glut of cash that has flowed into the English game. ""Because of fan influence, fans have prevented ticket prices from rising in Germany and they are 50% lower than in England,"" argues Professor Stefan Szymanski, co-author of the book ""Soccernomics."" ""But although tickets prices are twice as high (in England) almost exactly the same amount of people go to watch, and way more people watch second and third-tier football than in Germany. The money gets largely spent on players. ""The money does not go into the pockets of fat cats as the clubs make no money. England pays way higher wages than in Germany. You ask Manchester City fans what they think about large ticket prices, they'd be quite happy. You get more expensive players and far better performance."" Szymanski points to English clubs' relative success against German sides in the Champions League over the past decade. English teams have won 36 matches of 68 total encounters, German teams just 16. ""German fans complain bitterly that their teams are not competitive in Europe because other teams spend more money than they do,"" he says, adding that financial transparency is also improved. ""I've got 95% of the published accounts in England between 1984 to 2010 -- 3,200 sets of accounts. I physically possess them. England is totally transparent. In Germany, you just have to trust those running the club."" A level playing field? Not all German clubs are governed by the ""50+1"" rules. Wolfsburg and Bayer Leverkusen are both owned by corporations -- Volkswagen and the pharmaceutical giant Bayer -- while Hoffenheim has been bankrolled by a German billionaire who officially owns a minority stake but whose money makes the club's continued presence in the Bundesliga almost entirely dependent on him. And many German soccer fans would recoil in laughter at the thought that Bayern Munich is somehow the club of the people. ""It is not so much the ownership structure, it is that they are the superpower abusing their position, arrogant and systematically weakening all the other teams by buying the best players,"" explains CNN contributor and Suddeutsche Zeitung correspondent Raphael Honigstein. ""Maybe the best comparison is with Manchester United 10 years ago, before the Glazers. They had a tremendous supporter base (Bayern boasts a fan base of over nine million in Germany alone) and there was hatred from them because of their success. ""It (the '50+1' rule) is good, it has symbolic value and does stop excess. But it doesn't really stop people who really want to get involved and it allows for exceptions which angers clubs. It is not the promised land."" Partial proof of this can be found in the remarkable success both clubs have in generating revenue. Although Bayern is 82% owned by fans (compared to 0% cent at Chelsea), according to the 2012 Deloitte Football Money League Bayern made Â£71.6 million ($113 million) more in revenue last year than Chelsea. Bayern also has a brand new, state-of-the-art, 70,000-capacity stadium and can afford to sign top internationals such as Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and Mario Gomez. Winner takes all? Both clubs made it to the final of the Champions League, but will whoever wins truly prove which model is best? ""I think a victory for Bayern is definitely a victory for the supporter-owned model of a club,"" says Conn. ""(German clubs have) standing areas and affordable tickets, so young people and poorer people from all sections of society can still support football, as they have done since the game began -- until 1992 in England."" Of course, if Chelsea fans are celebrating on Saturday, they would beg to differ. * countries: Germany, France, U.K., Spain, Italy . ** countries: Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Ukraine, U.K., USA .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Israeli government asked the country's high court Friday for a delay in the scheduled demolition of an unauthorized West Bank settlement outpost. Many of the homes built by Jewish settlers in a neighborhood of the Beit El outpost are located on private Palestinian land. Last year the Israeli government told the court the homes would taken down by May 1. The right-wing government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked the court for a three-month delay in carrying out the demolitions so a government committee can reassess the current policy of demolishing settler homes built on private Palestinian land. In the request the government argued, ""The evacuation of the buildings could carry social, political and operational ramifications for construction in Beit El and other settlements."" An official in Israel's Justice Ministry who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter said the case of Beit El differed from other illegal settler outposts because it was home to dozens of families that would lose their homes if the demolition went ahead. Many of these houses have existed since the 1980s. Illegal outposts are usually much smaller and not so well established. Previous Israeli governments have pledged to demolish the unauthorized settler outposts in the West Bank, but only a handful have been removed. Michael Sfard, an attorney for Yesh Din, an Israeli nongovernmental organization that advocates for Palestinian rights, said the request was ""an announcement of war by the Israeli government against the rule of law."" ""They said clearly that they have reached a decision not to evacuate illegal construction on private Palestinian property,"" Sfard said. ""They ask for 90 days to change the policy. What kind of legal option is there when private property is taken other than restoring the possession of the property to its rightful owner?"" The request comes just days after the Israeli government said it had decided to legalize the status of three other settlements that were built in the West Bank during the 1990s. The move to authorize the settlements of Sansana, Rechelim and Bruchin was based on ""decisions by previous governments,"" Netanyahu's office said in a short statement issued earlier this week. The announcement was condemned by the Palestinians and brought public criticism from both the European Union and the United States. The issue of settlements and their continued growth is a key obstacle in the path of reviving the moribund peace process between Israelis and Palestinians.","Many homes of Israeli settlers in a West Bank outpost are on private Palestinian land .

"(CNN) -- An ""America's Got Talent"" contestant's emotional story of getting hit by a grenade in Afghanistan is not backed up by military records. And now, questions surround whether he embellished his heroic tale. Timothy Poe wowed the three judges on the NBC program Monday night after stuttering when he spoke, but singing ""If Tomorrow Never Comes"" without a hitch. He said that the stutter was caused by the grenade attack and that he didn't really know he could sing until his speech pathologist told him to try singing in the shower. After receiving an emphatic ""yes"" from each judge, advancing him to the contest's next round, Poe walked offstage and told host Nick Cannon, ""Oh my God, it's amazing. I was so scared up there I c-couldn't remember where to put my fingers. I was like, oh I didn't know."" ""I don't know if you just noticed,"" Cannon responded, congratulating him, ""but this whole sentence that you just said you didn't stutter one bit."" In an interview Tuesday with the ""You Served"" podcast, Poe said he does not stutter always, ""just when I get stressed or nervous or something big happens."" On the NBC show, Poe said he served in the military for 14 years. In 2009 in Afghanistan, he said, he was struck by rocket-propelled grenade. ""By the time I turned and went to jump on top of my guys, I yelled 'grenade' and the blast had hit me,"" he said. The attack ""broke my back and gave me a brain injury, so that's the reason why I stutter a little bit,"" he said. The Minnesota Army National Guard issued a statement saying Poe served from 2002 to 2011. ""His military records indicate that he served with the Minnesota National Guard in Kosovo from Oct. 10, 2007 until July 15, 2008, and was deployed to Afghanistan from July 28, 2009 to Aug. 30, 2009,"" the statement said. ""Sgt. Poe's official military records do not indicate that he was injured by a grenade in combat while serving in Afghanistan in 2009, as he reports. The Minnesota National Guard can also confirm that he was not awarded the Purple Heart Medal for wounds sustained in combat."" Poe could not be reached for comment Thursday. In his Tuesday interview, Poe said he had requested to have his medical records changed to note everything that had happened to him. The Minnesota National Guard said it has no proof that his injuries resulted from combat action, but that it would correct his records if Poe provided that proof. He told TMZ on Wednesday that his story is true, and that not all military injuries are recorded. But he did not provide any documents to back up his story, saying he couldn't for legal reasons, TMZ reported. NBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday morning. One of the three judges, radio personality Howard Stern, tweeted Wednesday that if the reports were true, he's ""disgusted,"" but added that he is reserving judgment until all the facts are in. Some people who say they served with Poe are slamming him online, insisting his story is false. Among them is Joshua Hansen, who posted on Facebook that he was Poe's squad leader. ""He was nowhere near direct enemy contact,"" Hansen wrote. He added, ""I knew where and what my guys were doing at all times ... I wish he would just end this now and quit the bs and man up."" Hansen could not be reached immediately for comment Thursday. Lt. Col. Kevin Olson, a spokesman for the Minnesota National Guard, confirmed to CNN that Hansen and two others who are denying Poe's story online were deployed with him in the 114th Transportation Company to Afghanistan in 2009. Poe's ex-wife Kelly Ballard told the New York Post that she never heard her former husband stutter and that he had no combat injuries. For his ""America's Got Talent"" performance, Poe was accompanied by his fiancÃÂ©e. And he talked about the moments after the grenade attack. ""When I was lying there, I thought I was never going to be able to see my daughter walk down the aisle, throw the baseball with my son again, or be able to hold them and see them,"" he said. In his interview with the ""You Served"" podcast Tuesday, Poe said the grenade attack ""may not have happened exactly how I explained because I don't remember a whole bunch, but the unit was there."" He confirmed that Hansen was his squad leader. ""(Hansen) wasn't right there when it happened, but I mean the whole unit was doing things,"" Poe said. ""When (the grenade) went off, I was fine,"" he added. ""I didn't say a word about it because the dizziness had gone away for about three days or four days,"" Poe said. He said he was sent out of Afghanistan to get medical treatment in Germany for a traumatic brain injury, ""because I had a blast by my head,"" which caused him to forget things, ""and I couldn't walk straight."" Poe said he has a previous, permanent back injury stemming from service in 2003 in Iraq. When asked whether there was anything he said on the show that was inaccurate or embellished, he responded, ""Sure. Just like you're telling your kid that you were this really cool, cool person one time. It was a show, you know? It wasn't out there to make anyone feel bad. It wasn't out there to make the soldiers that are going through things feel bad, it was just to show them that it doesn't matter what happens in life, you can overcome it.""","NEW: The Minnesota National Guard says it will change his records if he provides proof .

"(CNN) -- This morning, around 10 a.m., I was 10 years old again. At that hour, the space shuttle Discovery, mounted atop a NASA jetliner, soared over Washington and the Capitol Mall on the way to its permanent home at the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Dulles International Airport. I had walked over from my apartment complex toward Southwest Waterfront Park along the Potomac River to see this double-decker aircraft flying over my head, and stared agog at it like the goofy space-age nerd boy of 50 years ago, face pressed against a black-and-white television screen, listening, back then, to the voice of NASA media spokesman John ""Shorty"" Powers count backward to zero before a ballistic missile boosted a Project Mercury astronaut into low Earth orbit. Read more about the shuttle's destination . Back then, it was hard not to imagine that by 2012 we would have a permanent multinational lunar base from which ships with people would be traveling every other month to Mars -- and from there, maybe, to one of Jupiter's potentially habitable moons. We can see those things better than we once did, thanks to things like the Hubble Space Telescope, which wouldn't be working now unless people went up in shuttles for repairs and maintenance. But we're nowhere near being ready or, worse, willing to go there ourselves. Spot the shuttle, share a photo with CNN iReport . I have many friends who think that's just fine. They're a lot like the friends I had back in the '60s who believed I was a ninny for gaping at space walks and rendezvousing spaceships, while billions of those dollars were more urgently needed on the ground for such things as education. Maybe they're right, I sometimes thought. I don't think that anymore, having read in ""Space Chronicles"" (Norton), a recently published collection of articles by astrophysicist and Hayden Planetarium director Neil deGrasse Tyson, that only 4% of the U.S. budget during the 1960s went toward meeting President John F. Kennedy's goal of landing men on the moon before 1970. He also writes that even with the shuttle program in place, along with all those satellite repair missions, the $100 million operating budget for NASA represents six years of the agency's total funding and that said funding amounts to ""one half of one percent of [a U.S. citizen's] tax bill."" Which still sounds like too much to some. But think of what, ultimately, we're buying with that money. I'm not just talking about all that ancillary technology generated by space travel that eventually improves people's lives. I'm talking about something more intangible and, yet, more vital to our basic needs. Bear with me. I believe it wasn't just coincidence that both the space race and the civil rights movement reached their respective apogees at roughly the same time: the late 1950s and early 1960s. Think about the integration of Little Rock High School starting barely a month before the Russian launch of Sputnik, which galvanized the United States, pushing it toward not just sending its own satellites, but also getting busy with improving and funding math and science education. I also think about the morning of May 5, 1961, the day that Alan Shepard was scheduled to become the first American to fly into space, an act that would help commit his country to a full-fledged moon race. That same morning, newspapers all over the country showed a picture of a bus set ablaze by white racists wishing to quell a movement by black and white civil rights activists to ensure racially integrated travel on interstate bus lines in the South. At the time, the tendency was to think of such events as being at best mutually exclusive. I think they are now both logical and synchronous outgrowths of the human impulse to break down barriers and move ahead. The less afraid we are to think outside the box scientifically, the less afraid we are of other barriers, other things that constrict our natures. This week, Major League Baseball celebrated the 65th anniversary of Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier on April 15, 1947. Seven months later, almost to the day, Chuck Yeager poked a hole in the sky with a rocket plane and broke the sound barrier. I do not say one event led directly to the other (not necessarily, anyway). But I do think both were driven by the same insistent energy to fly higher, push harder, maybe even make ourselves better people in the very long run. I will try very hard not to consider Discovery's last touchdown as the end of something, though I still fear it may signify the beginning of the end -- not just of a dream, but of our very capacity to dream.

"(CNN) -- I never imagined we would find a no-win question to displace the genre's champ, ""Have you stopped beating your wife?""Â  Now, there is contender: ""Does austerity work?"" Fareed Zakaria tells us it doesn't, faulting it for Europe's constriction.Â  The problem is not a borderless European financial system, unable to quarantine nations sick with public and private debt.Â  Oh, no, Zakaria writes, ""The larger failure, shared across Europe, has been too much austerity."" In the Washington Post, Ezra Klein notes unemployment is ""skyrocketing"" across Europe and he contends the fault lies in shrinking budget deficits brought by spending cuts and tax increases.Â  Klein tells us this is what austerity looks like ""and it can be expected to reduce economic growth."" As the UK slides into a double-dip recession, economist Paul Krugman blames David Cameron's austerity. Borrowing from John Maynard Keynes, he tells us, ""The boom, not the slump, is the right time for austerity."" Never mind that spending in Britain is virtually unchanged and other nations in Europe are spending more. Neal Reynolds writes that ""austerity,"" as practiced in Euro27 countries, has actually increased government spending from 46% to 51% of Europe's GDP from 2006 to 2010. Greece, where rioters protest ""austeros,"" increased its public sector expenditures from 45.2 % of GDP to 50.1% tin he same period.Â  As the Richmond Times-Dispatch noted, in 2011, 23 of the EU's 27 nations jacked up their spending levels. This year 24 will.Â Apparently, it is not austerity itself that constricts economies.Â  The mere thought of austerity is enough to choke the eurozone to death. Austerity seems to be working just fine for the masters of the practice, the Germans:Â  We are counting on them to bail out the entire eurozone.Â  Let's ignore that, however. Instead, let's assume Europe had not only contemplated austerity but also actually imposed it: cutting spending, raising taxes and shrinking its public sector. Even then, ""Does austerity work?"" would be the wrong question.Â  Let's view the occasional need to embrace responsibility through a more familiar, though equally unpopular lens: Does ""sobriety"" work? Immediately, it wouldn't seem so. When we engage in ""sobriety,"" after a long period of over-indulgence, its effect is much like ""austerity;"" our heads hurt, our tongues get fuzzy and our vision blurs.Â  I would invite my friends in journalism, dedicated to the rigorous pursuit of truth, to join me in extended study.Â  We might conclude, through the crusty eyes of another morning, that drinking alcohol does not cause hangovers; stopping drinking alcohol causes hangovers.Â  Sobriety does not work, it seems -- and governments feel no better when they sober up from a binge. When an economy stops borrowing money from its future, well, there is less money in that economy in the present.Â  Post-indulgence discipline is painful.Â  Yet we do not blame the glutton who ordered the meal for this poverty, just the fool who pays the check. We fault austerity. Wouldn't we all feel better if we lifted our glasses and had another round?Â  We are persuaded to drink our way through our drunkenness, even if we have to borrow the money. Why shouldn't gratification be instant and eternal? Life, we are eager to believe, should be frictionless.Â  We are happy to hear that we are not required to suffer penalties for stupid economic decisions.Â  Our leaders, godlike and high above, tell us their brilliance can protect us from the consequences of our poor choices.Â  Spend what we don't have, they urge:Â  The same euro, dollar or pound that is invaluable when we put it in to stimulate an economy will not be missed when we pull it out. The same journalists who laugh at the idea of perpetual motion embrace the voodoo of perpetual prosperity. They twist modest Keynesianism into an arrogant declaration that we are above the cost of our excesses.Â  No longer must God ask Moses to walk the desert to reach the Promised Land. On June 17, the world will come to an end, as it often does.Â  Ripples from Europe's unraveling will begin traveling to America.Â  Greece will have an election.Â  Greeks will vote to make Germans work until they are 67 so they can retire at 50.Â  They will vote to make someone else pay their bills, fund their holidays and support their benefits. They will be lectured about this by an American president who asks his own nation to make China pay its bills, fund its holidays and support its benefits.Â  We can only hope he does it from the Hellenic state of California, which has also attempted to outsmart austerity.Â  Remarkably, it hasn't grown jobs, just debt. Paul Krugman is a noble man.Â  If he could, with his bright mind, he would free us from the costs of our foolish economic decisions, many of which he has recommended.Â  He is the blackjack player, deep in debt, who knows he can outsmart the house. On our behalf, with his infallible system, he'll keep doubling his bet every hand until he wins back our money -- unless he hits the house limit or a run of bad luck empties his pockets first.Â  That is not an uncommon fate for the adversaries of austerity. Genuinely bright people built Las Vegas on the arrogance of such men.

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan authorities have arrested a key ideological leader of the FARC leftist guerrilla group who is known as ""The Singer"" for his role as a musician promoting the rebel movement, officials said Wednesday. A Venezuelan government operation Tuesday captured Guillermo Enrique Torres, Colombia's president said. ""Today he is in custody and (Venezuelan) President (Hugo) Chavez has told us that he will be handed over to us,"" Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said. CNN affiliate Caracol TV reported that Torres, 57, became famous ""because he always carried on his shoulder, next to his rifle, a guitar."" Several online video posts purport to show Torres, who is also known by the alias Julian Conrado, wearing military fatigues and cradling a guitar. In one, he sings about why he decided to become a guerrilla, and vows to continue fighting for the FARC ""until death, for justice and peace, which is what I want."" Santos described Torres as a ""narco-terrorist"" when announcing the arrest Wednesday. The U.S. State Department had offered a $2.5 million reward for information leading to his capture, describing Torres as a leader who had helped set and implement cocaine policies for the guerrilla group. Rebels from the left-wing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, commonly known as the FARC, have fought to overthrow the Colombian government for decades. Authorities allege that Torres was a part of the inner circle of FARC leader Luis Edgar Devia Silva -- known as Raul Reyes -- who was killed in a 2008 raid in Ecuador. Shortly after the raid, Colombian authorities announced that Torres had also been killed in the operation. They later retracted that statement, saying DNA tests showed that another man had been killed. Venezuela's justice ministry confirmed Torres' detention in a statement Wednesday. His arrest comes amid improving relations between the neighboring South American countries. Tensions had flared between the two nations after Colombia accused Venezuela of harboring members of the FARC. But shortly after his inauguration last year, Santos met with Chavez and pledged to wipe the slate clean. In April Venezuelan authorities arrested Joaquin Perez Becerra, whom Colombian authorities accuse of conspiring in and helping finance terrorism through his alleged work as a spokesman for the FARC in Europe. And in May Colombian authorities extradited to Venezuela Walid Makled Garcia, accused of being one of the world's top drug lords. In a Twitter post Wednesday, Santos praised Chavez for helping capture Torres. A statement on the Colombian president's website noted that ""the collaboration of the Venezuelan government is going to help the (Colombian) Armed Forces be much more effective than they have been.""","Colombia's president says Guillermo Enrique Torres was captured Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa will face an investigation into whether his presidential campaign received money from Colombian leftist guerrillas, Ecuador's attorney general's office said. The investigation was initiated based on a report by the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. This month the organization released a book-length dossier that examines in detail the relationship between Venezuela, Ecuador and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia guerrilla group -- commonly known as the FARC. The institute spent two years researching 30 years' worth of strategic documents and recent e-mails belonging to FARC leader Luis Edgar DevÃ­a Silva, whose nom de guerre was Raul Reyes. He was killed in a 2008 raid, leaving behind the digital records. In 2006, FARC contributed about $400,000 to Correa's campaign -- with $100,000 apparently directly from the rebel group and $300,000 more from its allies, the report alleged. Nigel Inkster, director of the institute, told CNN that those allies were drug traffickers. ""Correa almost certainly approved the use of these funds in his campaign, but this did not translate into a policy of state support for the insurgents during the brief period between Correa's inauguration and Reyes's death,"" the study said. ""Although the death of Reyes provoked a serious breach in relations between Colombia and Ecuador -- ironically a key FARC strategic objective -- it also interrupted FARC's burgeoning relationship with Quito (the Ecuadorian capital). There is no evidence that the relationship has since prospered."" Correa's current and former ministers have said that there is no truth to the allegations made in the report.","President Rafael Correa denies receiving any money from the FARC .

"(CNN) -- The Colombian military killed a rebel leader who was a liaison with Mexican drug cartels, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said. The military operation near Colombia's border with Ecuador, in the department of Putumayo, happened on Tuesday, the president said. The rebel leader known as ""Oliver Solarte"" worked directly for the secretariat of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. ""He was a very important person inside the FARC,"" the president said Tuesday. ""He managed all the drug trafficking and arms trafficking for the southern bloc of the FARC."" Solarte also was the FARC's contact with Mexican cartels to traffic drugs and accept financing, he said. The FARC leader was a former militia leader for the organization and had been wanted by authorities for a long time, the president said. The operation was a ""very important strike"" against the FARC, he said. ""Again, I want to tell them that if they continue as they are they are going to fall one after another, because here we don't lower our vigilance and we have many more in our sights,"" Santos said. Along with Solarte's body, authorities recovered communications equipment, six grenades, ammunition and 11 mobile phones, the military said. Solarte was sought for extradition to the United States for drug trafficking and was wanted in Colombia for terrorism, kidnapping, rebellion, and murder.","""Oliver Solarte"" was the FARC's liaison with Mexican drug cartels .

"(CNN) -- Juventus secured their sensational return to the elite of Italian football after winning the league title with a regulation 2-0 victory over Cagliari. Goals from Mirko Vucinic and a Michele Canini own goal handed Juventus the advantage in the race for the Scudetto. But even though the Old Lady of Turin has gone unbeaten this season, their fate ultimately rested with events at the San Siro stadium where the Milan derby was kicking off simultaneously. Holders Milan started the day one point behind Juve but knew they had to beat Inter to take the title chase to the final weekend. What followed was one of the most memorable Milan derbies in recent years, as Inter ran out 4-2 winners with Diego Milito scoring a hat trick, the first person do so in this fixture in almost six decades. The victory handed Juventus title number 28. Or so you would think. As fans invaded the pitch in Trieste, where Cagliari are currently playing their matches, some held banners aloft proclaiming the triumph to be Scudetto number 30. That's because in 2006 the club was stripped of the two titles they won under former England coach Fabio Capello following a match fixing scandal that engulfed the club and saw them relegated to Serie B. It was a humiliating experience for one of world football's greatest clubs, but this season has seen something close to redemption, as the club has gone 37 games unbeaten under the reign of former Italian international Antonio Conte. It is his first season in charge. The team celebrated wildly with the fans in Trieste, while the Rossoneri wondered what might have been in the San Siro. A highly dubious first half penalty converted by Swedish international Zlatan Ibrahimovic had canceled out Milito's opener. Ibrahimovic, a former Juve player who has never been forgiven by the fans for leaving the club so soon after their relegation to Serie B, then gave Milan hope scoring his second 30 seconds after the start of the second half. But Inter powered forward, winning their own penalty converted by Milito to secure his hat trick, before Maicon scored a stunning fourth and sealed Juventus' return to where many believe they have always belonged.","Juventus won the Italian league after beating Cagliari 2-0 .

"(PopSci.com) -- More than 130 veterans of the Iraq war now face the daunting challenge of learning to live with a missing arm. To make that transition easier, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, has launched a $55-million project that pools the efforts of prosthetics experts nationwide to create a thought-controlled bionic arm that duplicates the functions of a natural limb. The Darpa arm must not only perform like the real thing but resemble it too. If all goes well, by 2009 the agency will petition the Food and Drug Administration to put the arm through clinical trials. This summer the team hit a critical milestone when it finished Proto 2, a thought-controlled mechanical arm -- complete with hand and articulated fingers -- that can perform 25 joint motions. This dexterity approaches that of a native arm, which can make 30 motions, and trumps the previously most agile bionic arm, the Proto 1, which could bend at the elbow, rotate its wrist and shoulder, and open and close its fingers. A person wearing a Proto 2 could conceivably play the piano. The next steps are to shrink the battery, develop more-efficient motors, and refine the bulky electrodes used to read electrical signals in muscles. As for making actual music, the wearer is on his own. How it works: . Copyright Â© 2009 Popular Science .","Darpa launches $55-million project to create a thought-controlled bionic arm .

"(CNN) -- If New York, London, Paris and Milan have been the traditional compass points of world fashion, Lagos has typically not even figured on the map. But according to Penny McDonald, organizer of the Arise Magazine Fashion Week held in Nigeria's largest city last week, that is unlikely to be the case for much longer. She said the event, which drew 77 designers and big names including supermodel Alek Wek, British couturier Ozwald Boateng and up-and-coming model Dudley O'Shaughnessy, had gone a long way to establishing Lagos as Africa's fashion capital, a city with international style credentials. ""It's raised the bar,"" said McDonald, international managing director for Arise, a title which describes itself as Africa's global style and culture magazine. ""Everyone knows it's New York, London, Paris and Milan -- and we see this as the fifth destination now. We're hoping to make Lagos a fashion destination, part of the fashion season."" Why Lagos? ""It's the vibrancy, the colors. We feel it's Africa's capital,"" said McDonald. ""Lagos women in particular, they dress like no other. They love haute couture. They look the part, they get fashion. Where else would you host such an event?"" While last year's inaugural event had a heavy Nigerian focus, this year's fashion week drew designers from across the continent and further afield. The runways, housed in massive tents on the grounds of the Federal Palace Hotel, showcased designs from Kenya, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, South Africa, Ghana, Liberia and Somalia -- but also from Martinique, Jamaica, Thailand and India. Eleven African-American designers attended, along with international media and buyers, demonstrating the growing power of the African fashion brand, said McDonald. ""You wouldn't have got them coming from as far away as America if there wasn't a buzz around this event."" Watch: Traditional dress of Senegal . Nigerian-based Italian designer Caterina Bortolussi exhibited her label Kinabuti at the event for the first time, using non-professional models scouted from Nigeria's streets. She said she relished the chance for her ""ethical fashion"" label, which she describes as a Nigerian-Italian brand, to share a platform with accomplished designers such as South Africa's Kluk CGDT -- jointly named alongside Nigeria's Maki Oh as ""designer of the year"" at the event. ""It's an amazing opportunity to learn, to challenge yourself, to network,"" she said. ""It's not easy to do things down here."" The most noticeable commonality among African designers was that they were ""very proud of being African,"" she said. ""Fashion is a way to bring a message of positivity. People usually look at Africa in a skeptical way, a place that needs to be helped. But fashion creates a vehicle to showcase Africa in a different way."" McDonald said that while many designers derived inspiration from the heritage of African textile traditions, no prevailing theme united the collections. This was a sign that African fashion had ""come of age,"" she said. ""No one designer produced the same look as another, which really showcases the vastness of the continent. People were surprised the collections were so varied."" The event had its share of setbacks, with the first two days canceled due to electricity shortages. But momentum was quickly recovered, with more than 1500 people trying to crowd into the tent on the last day. ""The audiences were enthralled by it -- the silks, the golds, the sheer size of the event,"" said McDonald. Away from the fashion, the presence of young British model Dudley O'Shaughnessy -- hot property following his appearance in a Rihanna music video, and named ""male model of the year"" at the event's awards -- caused the biggest stir. ""The audiences went berserk, there's no other way of describing it,"" said McDonald. ""That was the biggest buzz behind the scenes -- he couldn't even leave the hotel.""","Arise Magazine Fashion Week held in Lagos, Nigeria .

"(CNN) -- Argentina's star-studded team went top of South America's 2014 World Cup qualifying group as Lionel Messi inspired a 4-0 thrashing of Ecuador on Saturday. With his top Europe-based players to call on, coach Alejandro Sabella saw his side effectively end the match with three goals after only half an hour. Sergio Aguero, top scorer for English champions Manchester City last season, broke the deadlock in the 20th minute as he celebrated his 24th birthday in style. Strike partner Gonzalo Higuain, who helped Real Madrid to the Spanish title, doubled the lead nine minutes later. Barcelona's three-time world player of the year Messi made it 3-0 two minutes later to continue his unbelievable scoring form, having netted 73 times for the Spanish club in the recently-completed 2011-12 campaign. Real Madrid winger Angel Di Maria wrapped up the scoring with 15 minutes to play as Argentina moved up to 10 points from five games, just ahead of Chile. Messi was key to the victory, which came ahead of next Saturday's friendly against Brazil in the United States. The 2014 hosts lost 2-0 to Mexico in a friendly in Texas on Sunday. He combined with Di Maria to set up Aguero's opener and then linking with Higuain for his own goal before also setting up the final effort. Chile moved onto nine points from five matches with a 2-0 win over bottom team Bolivia, who had Luis Gutierrez sent off in the second half. Midfielder Charles Aranguiz scored against the run of play just before halftime in La Paz, then Gutierrez saw red for a foul on Barcelona's Alexis Sanchez before Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal wrapped it up with seven minutes to play. Uruguay had earlier gone top on eight points from four games despite being held 1-1 at home by Venezuela, with striker Diego Forlan's 39th-minute opener canceled out by Salomon Rondon's late goal. In Asian qualifying, regional champions Japan started the final round with a 3-0 win over Oman in a Group B tie on Sunday. CSKA Moscow midfielder Keisuke Honda scored in the first half, while Japan-based Ryoichi Maeda doubled the lead after halftime and his blocked shot later allowed Stuttgart striker Shinji Okazaki to seal the victory. ""The importance of winning the first match, the players were very well aware of that and so the match went exactly as I had expected,"" said Japan's Italian coach Alberto Zaccheroni. ""Before the match some of the players were a little bit too nervous."" Jordan came from behind to draw 1-1 with Iraq in Sunday's other Group B fixture in Amman. Ahmad Hayel equalized just before halftime after an early opener by Nashat Akram. Iran snatched a 1-0 win away to Uzbekistan in Group A as substitute Mohammad Reza Khalatbari scored on the counterattack in time added on with virtually the last kick of the game. ""We have won a very important match. We won the match because we have a great coach and players and we played well,"" said Iran's former Real Madrid and Portugal coach Carlos Queiroz. ""I knew Uzbekistan would go forward in the last minutes, that's why we changed our tactics and tried to score from counterattacks. We did it and our changes brought us three points."" Qatar won 1-0 away to Lebanon in the other Groupm A fixture, with Uruguay-born striker Sebastian Soria taking advantage of a defensive mistake to score the only goal just after the hour mark. In African qualifying, Nigeria edged out Namibia 1-0 at Calabar thanks to an 80th-minute goal from Spain-based striker Ikechukwu Uche. Kenya drew 0-0 with Malawi in Sunday's other Group F opening-round match. New Benin coach Manuel Amoros enjoyed a 1-0 win over Group H rivals Mali, who finished third at January's Africa Cup of Nations.

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid may have ended Barcelona's Spanish title reign in midweek, but Lionel Messi is poised to dethrone Cristiano Ronaldo as La Liga's goal king after adding four more to his tally on Saturday. The three-time world player of the year paid the ultimate tribute to Josep Guardiola in the coach's final home game, which ended in a 4-0 victory over city rivals Espanyol. The Argentina forward went into the match having already broken Gerd Muller's longstanding record of 67 goals in a European season, and he took his tally to an incredible 72 ahead of next weekend's closing league game at Real Betis. Fifty of those have come in La Liga, putting him five clear of Ronaldo -- who also scored in Saturday's 2-1 win at Granada that kept Real seven points clear of Barca. It was an emotional night at the Camp Nou, where Guardiola said farewell to the fans he has enthralled with his team's magical style of football since taking over in 2008. ""I'll see you all soon, you will never lose me. I will miss you all very much. I'm the one on the losing end,"" he told the crowd. Then, referring to his assistant Tito Vilanova, who will take over the top job next season, he added: ""I leave you in the best possible hands. You don't know how appreciated I feel when I go home. Thank you all."" Messi opened the scoring in the 12th minute with a superb free-kick, then his second-half treble was aided by two penalties either side of a trademark low left-foot drive. Ronaldo, who topped the La Liga scoring charts last season with a then record 40 goals, was also on target from the spot as Madrid came from behind to snatch victory. Granada, battling to avoid relegation, led through Franco Jara in the fifth minute, but the world's most expensive player leveled in the 81st minute after being brought down in the box. Then, in time added on, David Cortes diverted Karim Benzema's cross into his own net to give Real the chance to finish the season on 100 points with victory next Sunday. Valencia guaranteed third place -- 29 points behind Barca -- with a 1-0 win over Villarreal, who face a final-day fight to avoid dropping into the bottom three. Malaga's bid for fourth place suffered a blow with a 2-1 defeat at Atletico Madrid, who are now two points adrift in fifth. Levante and Mallorca are another point back after the latter side won their clash 1-0. Second-bottom Sporting Gijon could still survive after a 2-1 win over Betis left the club three points adrift of Zaragoza and Vallecano.","Lionel Messi takes his La Liga tally to 50 goals this season with four against Espanyol .

"(CNN) -- One of Turkey's biggest clubs will not play European football next season after being found guilty of breaching UEFA's financial fair play rules. Besiktas, 13-time national champions, will miss out on continental competition for two of the next five seasons -- though the second qualification ban is suspended for a probationary period. UEFA said Bursaspor, another former Turkish titleholder, had also been barred from Europe next season while Turkish reports said Gaziantepspor will miss out the next time it qualifies due to a similar rules breach. Istanbul-based Besiktas had qualified for the second-tier Europa League after finishing fourth in the domestic table, but its place has now been provisionally given to Eskisehirspor. Eskisehirspor failed to earn a European place in the end of season playoffs, finishing behind Bursaspor -- whose Europa League place may now instead go to Istanbul B.B. The Turkish Federation had to submit its candidates for European competition on Thursday, but UEFA does not have to accept them. Bursaspor, which won the Turkish title for the first time in 2010 and competed in the European Champions League the following season, said it will appeal UEFA's ruling to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Its initial fine of â¬200,000 ($247,000) was cut to â¬50,000 ($61,000) by UEFA's appeals body, and suspended for a period of four years. ""We were not supposed to face a ban. This is a murder of law,"" Bursaspor chairman Ibrahim YazÄ±ic told the Anatolia news agency. ""I cannot understand how a club without debt like Bursaspor can be hit with a ban. We believe that UEFA will return from its mistake."" Besiktas had been fined â¬500,000 ($618,000) but this was reduced to â¬200,000 -- with half of that on probation for five years. It will also appeal. ""The biggest reason for the ban was stated as the delays in payments to players,"" lawyer Emin Ozkurt told CNN Turk. The Hurriyet Daily News said UEFA had earlier warned Besiktas about its levels of debt after looking at the club's accounts for the second and third quarters of 2011. Besiktas reached the last 16 of the 2011-12 Europa League, losing to eventual champion Atletico Madrid. The financial fair play rules have been introduced in order to stop clubs spending more than they earn and getting into difficulties. The regulations also seek to counter scenarios where wealthy benefactors bankroll excessive spending to the disadvantage of smaller rival clubs, and distort transfer market values. CNN Turk's Sercan Tezcanoglu contributed to this report.","Three Turkish clubs banned from European competition by UEFA .

"(CNN)  -- Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola is spoilt for striking choice as his side attempt to overcome a two-goal Champions League semifinal deficit against Inter Milan, but faces a defensive poser with captain Carles Puyol suspended. Puyol picked up a yellow card in the 3-1 defeat to Inter in the San Siro last weekend, ruling him out of the second leg, and he will be sorely missed at center back. Barca know that the concession of an early away goal would leave them facing an uphill task against Jose Mourinho's Italian champions and Guardiola must chose between Rafa Marquez and Gabi Milito to partner Gerard Pique in the center of their defense. He also is waiting on the fitness of full-back Eric Abidal, with Maxwell set to continue in his place. Pique and Milito played together at Real Zaragoza and were outstanding in the recent 'El Clasico' win over Real Madrid so may well get the nod from Guardiola. Pique is hoping the atmosphere in a capacity Nou Camp will make it an uncomfortable night for their opponents. ""I hope the atmosphere makes the Inter players hate their profession for 90 minutes,"" he told the official Barcelona club Web site. ""It all helps a great deal. I don't remember an atmosphere like this. People are so engaged, excited and confident. I feel really proud."" he added. Up front, Guardiola has no less than six in-form attacking options, with Lionel Messi and Pedro Rodriguez forming a lethal combination in recent matches while Swedish star Zlatan Ibrahimovic is returning to full fitness and scored in the weekend league win over Xerez. Ibrahimovic wants Barca to stay true to their attacking instincts after being shaken out of their strike in the first leg. ""We have to be ready for this war,"" he told AFP. ""They are going to exploit their virtues but we cannot change our way of playing like we did in Milan. We lost because we did not play our usual football, not because they won with their approach. Guardiola can also call on the likes of Thierry Henry, Bojan and young winger Jeffren as they attempt to break down Inter. Mourinho's men got their Serie A title bid back in full swing with a weekend victory over Atalanta, but midfield talisman Wesley Sneijder was injured in the 3-1 win and is battling to be fit with a hamstring strain.","Barcelona battling to claw back 3-1 deficit in Champions League semi against Inter .

"(CNN) -- Family members of thousands of Colombians who were killed or who disappeared are suing Chiquita Brands International, alleging the produce company is liable because of its payments to paramilitaries. ""We're holding them accountable,"" said Paul Wolf, a Washington-based attorney who is handling cases for family members of more than 2,000 victims. Chiquita counters their claims and says the lawsuits should be dismissed. The company, which had more than 200 banana farms in Colombia before selling them in 2004, argues that it was a victim of extortion and has no responsibility for any crimes armed groups committed. A federal judge in Florida is weighing whether the lawsuits, which constitute more than 4,000 claims against Chiquita, will go to trial. In 2007, Chiquita pleaded guilty and paid a $25 million fine for violating U.S. antiterrorism laws when it provided payments to the right-wing paramilitary United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, known as the AUC. But family members and representatives of people killed by paramilitaries say the criminal case settlement wasn't enough. ""This is a something entirely distinct, the reparations that (Chiquita) must make for the victims that suffered the consequences of the armed groups,"" said Ivan Cepeda, a Colombian lawmaker and victims' advocate. Chiquita spokesman Ed Loyd said the civil lawsuits are ""entirely without merit."" ""Chiquita gave in to the extortion demands only to protect its employees from being kidnapped and killed,"" he said in a written statement. ""Once the company became aware that these payments could potentially violate U.S. law, the company voluntarily disclosed the facts to the government and cooperated fully with the government's investigation."" The lawsuits, however, allege that the company knew it was funding terrorism. A lawsuit Wolf filed on behalf family members of 677 victims in March alleged that Chiquita officials ""were aware that their acts and omissions assisted in the violations of international law"" and ""acted willfully, wantonly and recklessly, with the intent to aid the terrorist acts of the AUC."" Under the guise of protecting the Colombian public from leftist rebel groups, the AUC committed numerous human rights abuses, according to the U.S. State Department and Human Rights Watch. The abuses included ""the massacre of hundreds of civilians, the forced displacement of entire villages and the kidnapping of political figures to force recognition of AUC demands,"" then-U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said in 2001, when he designated the group a terrorist organization. In their criminal case, federal prosecutors accused the Cincinnati-based company of paying more than $1.7 million to the AUC in two parts of Colombia where the company grew bananas. As part of those proceedings, Chiquita acknowledged that it had also made payments to the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -- known as the FARC -- from 1989 to at least 1997. At least one pending lawsuit -- also filed by Wolf -- seeks damages from Chiquita for hundreds of killings and disappearances related to the FARC. It is unclear when U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra will rule on whether the cases will go to trial, Wolf said. In a motion filed this month asking the judge to dismiss the lawsuits, Chiquita argued that the suits did not show any connection between Chiquita and violence in Colombia ""apart from the one fact that Chiquita has admitted -- that it authorized its Colombian subsidiary to accede to the extortion demands of right-wing and left-wing armed groups in Colombia in order to prevent retaliation against its employees."" If the lawsuits go to trial, Wolf said it is impossible to estimate the damages that could be awarded, but he said he hopes it will be a large figure that stops similar situations from occurring in the future. ""These kinds of lawsuits raise the price-tag for them (Chiquita). These are not completely powerless people who if they're killed, it doesn't matter, and nobody can do anything about it,"" Wolf said. ""It does matter, because they can sue for billions of dollars."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and journalist Fernando Ramos contributed to this report.","Chiquita says it was a victim of extortion and argues the cases should be dismissed .

"New York (CNN) -- The United States metes out certifications to other countries for their cooperation on drug trafficking, but as the nation with the biggest demand for illegal drugs, who evaluates the United States? Bolivian President Evo Morales posed that question in an interview with CNN en EspaÃÂ±ol, reiterating a recent comment that drew attention. Relations between Bolivia and the United States are at a low point as the Morales government accuses the United States of trying to destabilize it, while the United States counters that Bolivia is dropping the ball in the fight against drugs. Since coming into office, Morales has expelled the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. ambassador. ""Since we don't have an ambassador here, since we don't have DEA, and no dead and injured and no military bases from the U.S. here, they decertify us,"" Morales said Monday in the interview, which came during his visit to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly. Morales accused the DEA and the U.S. State Department of using their agents in other countries for political purposes. ""The origins of drug trafficking are in the demand, not the supply,"" he said. ""So I'd like for some international organism to certify or decertify the United States for their responsibility on the issue of drug trafficking."" The Bolivian president vowed to take his idea to regional bodies in Latin America to see if other countries agree. Morales, an ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, accused the United States of trying to taint all ""anti-imperialist"" countries with the drug-trafficking label. The comment was related to the arrest this year of retired Bolivian Gen. Rene Sanabria, a former anti-drug czar who was arrested in Panama and extradited to the United States to face drug trafficking charges. At the time of his arrest, Sanabria was working as an aide to a minister close to Morales. Morales alleged that the arrested general and the United States were working together on a plan to smear his country's reputation. ""We have information that he is negotiating his years in prison in exchange for something,"" Morales said. His anti-American rhetoric comes at a time when Morales is facing domestic pressures. Indigenous communities are protesting the proposed construction of a highway through a national park where they live. The indigenous groups have also called for an end to hydrocarbon extraction from the area. Morales called the demands unrealistic, noting that 90% of Bolivia's natural gas flows through that area. ""To cease means to leave the Bolivian people without resources,"" he said, adding that the government remains open to dialogue with the protesters. Last month, he also blamed the United States for stoking protest marches against the highway.","Bolivian President Evo Morales says the U.S. discredits his country .

"(Rolling Stone) -- Steven Tyler walked up the driveway to the entrance of the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles like it was a second home. Surrounded by a large entourage as he was led to the red carpet, Tyler stopped to bare a Cheshire Cat's grin as he looked at the four lovely Playboy Bunnies waiting to pose for pictures with him. The rock star and the equally iconic home that has hosted thousands of parties seemed made for each other, but this was Tyler's first visit ever to the Holmby Hills grounds. How was that possible that in all the years of Aerosmith's success, the frontman had never been to one of the famous Halloween parties or a Midsummer Night's Dream? ""I was too busy in someone's bathroom getting high,"" Tyler told Rolling Stone. ""I was too busy on tour, I was too busy writing songs. We were just busy."" While he had never been to the house that Hef built, Tyler has crossed paths with the famed Lothario, Hugh Hefner. And Tyler is a big fan. ""I love people that are committed to their crimes of passion and he is the gentleman of all time,"" Tyler told us. ""He's been on every man's mind around the world at least a hundred times in their lifetime for what he did. So he signifies the joys of womanhood and not the degradation . . . and even women love Playboy."" What finally brought Tyler to the mansion after more than 40 years in the spotlight was Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp, a program that allows people to live out their rock and roll dreams and spend four intense days training with counselors to play with Tyler or other superstars, such as Kiss' Gene Simmons, who will be the headliner at an upcoming event in Las Vegas from October 10 through 14. Tyler got involved with the camp last year through Mark Hudson, a counselor in the program who co-wrote Aerosmith's ""Livin' On The Edge."" ""We spoke last year, I was doing a book, and they asked me here and I said I would, and I spoke in front of the whole camp. It's called just being a mentor, if not to incite a riot,"" he says. Tyler had a challenge for this week's campers, who joined him on stage at the mansion last night. ""I just dared them all to learn an Aerosmith song to see how good they can do it,"" he says. ""If they do it good, which I'm sure they will, I'm gonna pick the best group of them all, we're gonna pick straws and the best one out of that gets to ride around in my car and hear the new Aerosmith album."" When Tyler says, while speaking of the upcoming record, ""I'm on fire, as you can tell,"" he is not exaggerating. Despite being pulled away by several handlers, he doesn't want to stop talking about the new music, which is now in the mixing stages. ""It's one of the best Aerosmith albums ever,"" he says. ""I'm one of the worst judges of my own music because I'm very harsh, highly critical. [But] we waited until we had at least four really good songs that were representative and we got 19.""

"(CNN) -- Average U.S. gasoline prices have dropped more than a nickel over the past two weeks, marking their first dip since December, according to a nationwide survey published Sunday. A gallon of regular now costs $3.91 on average, the Lundberg Survey found. That's down more than 5 cents from two weeks earlier, when the average was just a few cents below the $4 mark. ""We can thank crude oil for allowing gasoline to do what it has been wanting to do for weeks, which is drop,"" said publisher Trilby Lundberg. Gasoline supplies are plentiful, but crude oil prices had been ""propping up"" gasoline costs, she said. As crude oil prices have stabilized, gasoline prices have fallen. ""We may see another five to 10 cents decline in the next few weeks"" if crude oil doesn't rise, she said. Even looking ahead to later in May, as the country enters peak driving season, prices might not jump if crude oil stays stable because gasoline supplies are flush, Lundberg said. The average price nationally one year ago was $3.88 -- just three cents under the current average, Lundberg said. The Lundberg Survey tabulates prices every two weeks at thousands of gas stations nationwide. Over the past two weeks, the average price in Chicago has fallen nearly 19 cents, to $4.26 -- but that's still the highest of any city in the latest survey, taken Friday. The city with the lowest average gas price was Tulsa, Oklahoma, at $3.52. Here are prices in some other cities: . Atlanta: $3.79 . Boston: $3.95 . Denver: $3.87 . Houston: $3.85 .

"Washington (CNN) -- After three days of very public debate, the U.S. Supreme Court now retreats from the spotlight to make decisions that could topple some or all of the the sweeping health care reform bill championed by President Barack Obama. Oral arguments concluded Wednesday on legal challenges to the 2010 Affordable Care Act. In their final sessions, the justices tackled the question of what would happen if they ruled that the heart of the law, the individual mandate that is its key funding mechanism, was unconstitutional. The six hours of hearings over three days provided an extended public view of the high court in action on one of the most controversial issues of the day, touching on legal concepts involving federal and state powers, individual rights and legislative intent. High court listens to arguments on Medicaid expansion . At stake is the survival of the signature legislation of Obama's presidency as he seeks re-election in November: the health care reform law that requires most Americans to have health coverage as part of a systemic overhaul intended to lower costs. The justices looked at procedural issues Monday and then tackled the heart of the law Tuesday, the constitutionality of the individual mandate that requires people to get health coverage or pay a fine. High court divided over health care mandate . At issue Wednesday morning was whether all the law's 450 or so provisions would have to be scrapped if the individual mandate were found unconstitutional. A separate session Wednesday afternoon looked at whether states would be ""coerced"" by the federal government to expand their share of Medicaid costs and administration by the risk of losing federal funding if they refuse. To CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, the questioning by justices Wednesday signaled they are ready to invalidate the individual mandate, a step he said could put the entire law in jeopardy. ""I think the individual mandate is gone, based on the questioning,"" Toobin said after the morning session. ""It sure looks like there are at least five votes to get rid of ... the individual mandate."" Listen to oral arguments in the historic case . White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the Obama administration remained confident its signature health care law is constitutional. Anyone who tries to predict the outcome of the case based on the questions justices asked during this week's arguments ""is not a very good student of the Supreme Court,"" Earnest told reporters, adding that Justice Department lawyers faced similar tough questions from conservative judges in lower courts that later upheld the law ""in at least a couple of these cases."" However, some of the attorneys general of states opposing the health care law said the three days of arguments showed the justices had serious concerns about the law. ""What we've heard over the last few days is a growing concern from our Supreme Court justices about, perhaps, the federal government has gone too far at the expense of individual liberty and our states' rights,"" said South Dakota Attorney General Marty J. Jackley. Even though the health care law's individual mandate appeared to be on shaky legal ground, few on the court seemed eager to take the drastic step of throwing out the rest of the legislation. Read a transcript of Wednesday's arguments . ""There are so many things in this act that are unquestionably OK,"" said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, citing many provisions not directly related to market reforms such as Native American health care. ""Why make Congress redo those? I mean it's a question of whether we say everything you do is no good, now start from scratch."" Added Justice Elena Kagan, ""Half a loaf is better than no loaf,"" meaning some provisions would survive. However, lawyer Paul Clement, arguing for opponents of the law, told the justices that removing such a central provision of the law as the individual mandate would leave ""sort of a hollow shell"" that never would have passed Congress in such a diminished form. In addition, conservative justices appeared in no mood to pick and choose what to uphold in the rest of the law. ""You want us to go through 2,700 pages"" of the law? asked Justice Antonin Scalia. ""Is this not totally unrealistic ... to go through one by one and decide each one?"" Supreme Court, health care and one little girl . Justice Anthony Kennedy said he was reluctant to take on this ""awesome exercise of judicial power,"" at the expense of congressional discretion. This week's hearings were among the most politically charged and closely watched in years, with dueling protests and news conferences outside the court building every day on what is likely to be a central issue of the November presidential election. Overheard on CNN.com: Readers react to hearings . Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, a staunch opponent of the health care law, said Wednesday the entire measure falls apart if the Supreme Court invalidates the individual mandate. ""The individual mandate would be the funding stream that makes all of the rest of the act work,"" Bachmann said. If it gets ruled unconstitutional, then who pays for all the other provisions in the 2,700-page bill? she asked. Supporters argued that under legal precedent set by the court, the full health care law should be ruled constitutional. ""For the court to strike down this law would be to presume the powers of the Congress and abandon its role as an impartial and deliberate decider of constitutional law,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut. Another Senate Democrat, John Kerry of Massachusetts, acknowledged that supporters are looking at all possible outcomes. ""There is discussion quietly among some people about 'what ifs,' but there is no overall, you know, plan in place because I think that people have confidence the court will do the right thing,"" Kerry said. CNN's guide to the arguments . With the legal survival of the individual mandate in constitutional jeopardy, the question of ""severability,"" whether the rest of the law can stand if one part is invalidated, has become more important. All of this may be moot. If the court decides the mandate is constitutional -- even in a narrowly tailored way -- it will not even bother to take up the severability question presented Wednesday. In the morning arguments, the clearly divided court expressed concern over whether Congress would have passed the broad reform package without the key funding mechanism, the mandate, firmly in place. However, several of the justices seemed ready to let lawmakers eventually sort out the specific funding questions with or without the mandate. With the public debate now complete, the justices will likely gather as a group in a closed-door conference over the next few days and actually decide on the four health care appeals. Going one-by-one in order of seniority, they will all be thinking of the number five, which is how many votes it will take to achieve a majority. Two families, two viewpoints on health care reform . Once the tallies are sorted out, opinions will be assigned to individuals to craft over the next three months. What the court says in these written opinions, how it interprets the Constitution, will be far more important than what was said in the oral arguments this week. The rulings may be in essence how legislators, individual Americans and history will judge these justices. Wednesday's cases gave the administration another chance to regain the rhetorical offensive and defend the entire law's validity. Many legal observers concluded the Obama administration's solicitor general, Donald Verrilli Jr., did little to boost the individual mandate's constitutionality in two hours of intense arguments Tuesday. The questioning of Verrilli's performance was so widespread that the White House issued a statement Wednesday defending him. ""Mr. Verrilli is an extraordinarily talented advocate who possesses a sharp mind, keen judgment and unquestionable integrity,"" said the statement by White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler. ""He ably and skillfully represented the United States before the Supreme Court yesterday, and we have every confidence that he will continue to do so."" Wednesday's first argument dealt with severability, but most court watchers think of it as the ""domino effect"" issue -- if the individual mandate section is ruled unconstitutional, must the entire law collapse as well? A federal judge in Florida had so ruled in February 2011, saying: ""Because the individual mandate is unconstitutional and not severable, the entire act must be declared void."" However, a federal appeals court subsequently overruled on the severability question while upholding the individual mandate's unconstitutionality. Opponents of the law say the individual mandate is crucial to its overall impact, since it is the main funding mechanism for the expansion of a range of other programs. This might be the one question on which the justices will ultimately agree in favor of the government. The high court and election-year blockbusters . Later came the Medicaid ""coercion"" question, which can be seen as the ""national policy implications"" issue. Through this issue, the long-standing fight over ""federalism"" and the leverage the national government wields over states might soon reach epic levels with a high court decision either strengthening or limiting congressional authority on this and potentially a host of other regulatory areas. The cases argued Wednesday were National Federation of Business v. Sebelius (11-393) and Florida v. Department of Health and Human Services (11-400).

"Washington (CNN) -- Sarah Palin came right out of the gate with a stab at self-deprecating humor. As Matt Lauer announced that ""it is a pleasure to welcome Sarah Palin to the program this morning,"" the camera cut to Palin sitting on the ""Today"" show set in a sea of newspapers. Not only did that allow the former Alaska governor to poke fun at herself, it was also a thinly veiled nod to the morning's high stakes competition with ""Good Morning America"" guest host Katie Couric, who famously couldn't get an answer from Palin about what newspapers she read. Tweet of the day: McCain congratulations Palin . Expanding on the laugh-at-herself theme, the camera later zoomed in on Palin, sitting in Lauer's dressing room, writing notes on her hand with a sharpie. Again, it was making light of another classic Palin moment, when she was busted with talking points for a speech written on her hand. ""Thanks for letting me crash your dressing room,"" Palin said to Lauer. He thought it was funny, sort of. ""Technically, I didn't give you permission to be in there,"" he said dryly. Palin's first assignment in this much-hyped stint as guest ""Today"" show host was really as a guest. Historian speculates: What if Palin had run this year? She talked about Republican presidential front-runner Mitt Romney as if they'd poured sour milk in her coffee. ""Anything is still possible. There can still be a bit of a shake-up. But the numbers are what the numbers are,"" she said. When Lauer pressed her, saying it ""doesn't sound like you're happy with Mitt Romney as the party's nominee,"" Palin quickly responded with the bumper sticker line, ""anybody but Obama."" She had a warning for the next GOP vice presidential pick. ""It doesn't matter if that person has the national level experience or not, they're going to get clobbered by the lamestream media, who does not like the conservative message."" Yes, without a hint of irony, she took part in the longest running network morning show and whacked the mainstream media. Lauer couldn't help himself. ""You are going to stick around for the 8a hour, which technically makes you part of the lamestream media,"" he deadpanned. Sarah Palin's key moments . How much more mainstream media can you get than standing on the plaza outside NBC's ""30 Rock"" tossing to the weather? ""It's Al's turn, so let's get a check of the weather with Al,"" Palin said, throwing to Al Roker. As guest host, Palin took part in three segments. In ""Today's Professionals,"" they cleverly brought up the buzz about Ashton Kutcher playing Steve Jobs in an upcoming movie as a way to pivot to Palin and the HBO movie ""Game Change."" Palin repeated previous comments that she didn't watch the movie saying, ""I'm not going to waste my time there."" Nevertheless, she did give Julianne Moore a thumbs down for her portrayal. She volunteered that she liked another actress known for her uncanny Palin impersonation. ""I do have to admit that Tina Fey has been pretty clever,"" said Palin. She also defended Jessica Simpson's pregnancy weight gain. ""How would you have felt had someone criticized you for gaining too much weight,"" Lauer asked Palin. ""I would have wanted to punch them in the neck,"" she responded. Palin went on to say that this is only an issue ""because that Hollywood image is full of itty-bitty people,"" In the her next segment, she gushed over one of those itty-bitty Hollywood people, Tori Spelling, who is now pregnant with her fourth child. ""Keep going, keep going, the more the merrier,"" Palin told Spelling, as the daughter of Hollywood royalty-turned reality TV star promoted her book on how to host an economical party. ""How do you do it with five?"" Spelling asked Palin, gushing back, ""I don't know if I can handle four,"" The only segment Palin technically co-hosted was on mothering teenage daughters. At the end, Ann Curry got a real taste of what it's like when Palin goes rogue. Palin kept talking as a visibly anxious Curry tried to go to commercial break. The normally unflappable Curry even made a caught-on-television face at either the floor director or the control room, as Palin continued to talk to the guests about children wanting boundaries from parents. Back on the plaza, as she was saying goodbye to the ""Today"" show gang, Lauer asked how she enjoyed being ""part of the mainstream media."" She called it ""controlled chaos"" and quoted race car driver Mario Andretti as saying, if things are in control, ""you're going too slow."" In the end, Palin seemed to have fun with her one-day appearance, but the real arbiter of that will be how she rated in this head-to-head competition with Couric on ""Good Morning America."" After all, it was Palin herself who set it up that way, declaring ""game on.""","Sarah Palin is facing off against Katie Couric in competing guest hosting stints .

Morales replaced his production, environment and energy ministers with Ana Teresa Morales, Julieta Monje Villa and Jose Luis Gutierrez respectively, ABI reported. The shakeup comes one month after the government ended fuel subsidies. As gas prices shot up, major protests erupted, forcing Morales to reinstate the subsidies at the end of December. The president asked members of his new Cabinet for ""compromise"" and ""sacrifice"" as they begin their work, ABI reported.","Evo Morales reinstates 17 of the 20 ministers in his Cabinet .

When ""Bandstand"" proved to be a valuable tool for promoting new artists -- and, not incidentally, sanitizing them for Mom and Dad's approval -- Clark made sure it did its job, especially after it went national as ABC's ""American Bandstand."" As his career continued, he replaced the stodgy Guy Lombardo as the face of New Year's Eve, challenged the Grammys with the American Music Awards, filled daytime with quiz shows and prime time with variety programs, and was always on the lookout for the next big thing. Clark, who died Wednesday, became a force in the music industry and used his leverage to expand to television, radio and real estate. ""America's Oldest Teenager"" he may have been called, but behind that youthful countenance were the brains of a born entrepreneur. ""I knew being a performer does not necessarily carry with it a lot of longevity. That's why I became a producer,"" Clark, who had a degree in business from Syracuse University, once said. Even his critics had to agree -- perhaps grudgingly, perhaps admiringly -- that he was nothing if not shrewd. In 1968's ""Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom,"" his insightful history of pop, rock critic Nik Cohn dismissed Clark as ""an all-American choirboy"" who reigned as the father of ""highschool,"" the squeaky-clean Paul Anka-Connie Francis-Frankie Avalon pop music that dominated the late '50s and early '60s. Cohn expressed little love for the music of highschool, but he obviously respected Clark's abilities. ""You'd be making no wild guesses to imagine that he was one of the very richest men in pop,"" Cohn wrote. ""Godly or not, he sure had his head screwed on."" AC360: The business of being Dick Clark . That's the thing about Dick Clark -- he made no apologies about catering to the mainstream, even if it meant shaving off the rough edges of what could be a very rough music. When Lloyd Price's version of ""Stagger Lee"" was climbing the charts, Clark refused to have him on until a cleaner version could be recorded. ""His audience could not be exposed to a song which celebrated gambling and murder,"" wrote Dave Marsh in his book ""The Heart of Rock and Soul."" The song was cleaned up, Clark booked Price, and ""Stagger Lee"" went to No. 1. He was in the business of family entertainment -- a broadcaster in the truest sense of the term, says John Covach, a rock historian and chair of the music department at the University of Rochester. ""He was able to position himself in the center of the television and music industry in the way that allowed him to have a career that spanned a half a century,"" Covach says. From Clark to Kirshner to Cornelius . In that respect, he inspired a number of contemporaries and followers, including Don Kirshner, who started as a song publisher and later expanded to record labels, TV shows and other programming; Don Cornelius, a onetime salesman and journalist whose ""Soul Train"" became the crown jewel of his own broadcasting empire; and, of course, Ryan Seacrest, who started as a disc jockey and now hosts and produces television shows. ""If you're presenting pop music on TV, in some way Dick Clark is the person who opened the door,"" says Joe Levy, editor of Billboard magazine. Purists may find it easy to criticize these men, says Kovach, but appealing to the mainstream not only means the largest possible audience -- it means influencing the dialogue. ""That was Berry Gordy's strategy, too -- taking his black singing groups and getting them to a white audience,"" Covach says, referring to the Motown Records founder. ""He took a lot of criticism for having sold out the blackness of the music in search of a more mainstream audience."" But by doing so, Motown gained a larger following -- and influenced generations of musicians. On the other hand, there was Alan Freed, the raucous DJ who was among the first to call the combination of R&B, country and pop music ""rock 'n' roll."" Freed, Covach observes, was the more important figure in rock's early years. While Clark was gaining a national foothold for the Philadelphia-based ""Bandstand,"" Freed was already hosting a national radio show, appearing on a television show and producing movies. But Freed was a more abrasive character than the smooth Clark, and he was more upsetting to the era's establishment. (His prime-time TV series was canceled after African-American singer Frankie Lymon was seen dancing with a white teenage girl.) When the payola scandals of the late '50s engulfed the music industry -- DJs and music business types were given bribes to play certain records -- both Freed and Clark were subjects of scrutiny. But the scandals helped ruin Freed -- he was hurt by negative publicity -- while Clark divested himself of his music business interests and was praised as a hard-working young businessman, Covach says. It also prompted Clark to diversify, says Levy. ""The lesson learned was, 'I need other business interests,' "" he says. ""And that's the model he created."" Turning on adults . Clark wasn't the first to use his talent for entertaining as a springboard to bigger things. Bing Crosby invested in recording equipment, TV stations and horse racing; Gene Autry became a movie producer, rodeo businessman and baseball team owner. But it was Clark who saw the promise in combining pop music, television and the marketplace -- an audience of teenagers and their parents. ""He found that while teenagers avidly watched ['Bandstand'], adults also tuned in to see the teens dance,"" says Covach. That bore dividends when ""The Twist"" started catching on: Clark had a new recording of the Hank Ballard song made by newcomer Chubby Checker and helped make it a hit. It topped the charts twice, the second time because adults got into the craze: A famous picture of the era shows Jackie Kennedy doing the Twist. For all the criticism aimed at Clark, he didn't always play it safe. Levy recalls seeing Public Image Ltd., the prickly band led by former Sex Pistol John Lydon, on ""Bandstand."" The show provided TV debuts for Chuck Berry, The Doors, Jefferson Airplane, Otis Redding and Jerry Lee Lewis. Clark even changed the fortunes of Lewis' failing, raucous song ""Breathless"" by using it in a promotion with ""Bandstand"" sponsor Beechnut gum. ""Dick Clark bridged a color gap at a time when there should not have been one, giving musical life to black artists that may not have had a chance,"" Stevie Wonder -- another ""Bandstand"" debut -- said in a statement. And, along with the endless awards shows and music-variety packages, Clark also produced a show starring Weird Al Yankovic, a documentary with George Plimpton and the great TV movie ""Elvis,"" directed by John Carpenter and starring Kurt Russell as The King. Moreover, his shows were usually fun to watch. The Golden Globes are regularly disparaged for the outsize influence of the tiny Hollywood Foreign Press Association, but its show -- produced by Clark's production house -- is often considered more entertaining than the Oscars. Nowadays, Seacrest is probably Clark's closest model; the youthful ""American Idol"" host has acknowledged as much in many interviews, and in recent years he joined Clark as host of ABC's ""New Year's Rockin' Eve,"" which Clark established in 1972 -- two years before Seacrest was born. But though Seacrest has been aggressive in going from DJ to ""Idol"" host to Kardashian family/reality show producer, he's got a long way to catch his mentor: The Museum of Broadcast Communications estimates Clark's company produced more than 7,500 hours of programming. It's an impact that will continue to be felt, says Levy: ""He had a real influence on the music business and on the television business."" We're still dancing to his beat.","Dick Clark was a businessman first, entertainment talent second .

"Washington (CNN) -- How things change. In 2008, after a bruising primary battle with Hillary Clinton, then-Sen. Barack Obama was on the outs with former President Bill Clinton. This election cycle, Clinton is one of Obama's most visible surrogates. Obama and Clinton were to appear together Monday night at three New York City fundraisers, which are expected to bring in millions of dollars. In April, the two appeared side by side at the home of longtime Clinton supporter and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe, raising $2.1 million for the Obama campaign and the DNC. Clinton and Obama hit up the Big Apple . The Obama campaign is relying heavily on Clinton, tapping into his network of wealthy donors and featuring him in campaign ads. Clinton is also expected to hit the trail to rally voters leading up to the November election. ""Clinton just wants to help,"" a source close to the former president said. ""His message is 'I know what it takes on the economy, and Obama is doing the right thing.' They're not going to make the mistake of the Gore campaign. They're not going to put [Clinton] on ice."" Obama's relationship with the Clintons has had its ups and downs. In 2007, the former president took aim at the then-junior senator from Illinois as inexperienced. ""You know, I'm old-fashioned. I think it really -- I think a president ought to have done something for other people and for his country when you pick a president,"" Clinton said. ""I mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the Senate before he started running?"" In early 2008, when Obama won the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses and emerged as a real contender, he entered into an all-out feud with the former first couple. The tussle was on full display during a January 2008 debate. ""I'm here, not my husband,"" Hillary Clinton said to Obama. ""I can't tell who I'm running against sometimes,"" Obama retorted. The Clinton source says, ""He held a grudge, she didn't."" Obama picking Hillary Clinton as his secretary of state helped heal some wounds. And he's looked to Bill Clinton for help since taking office, hosting him at the White House during contentious negotiations with Congress in December 2010. ""I have a general rule, which is that whatever he asked me about my advice, and whatever I say, should become public only if he decides to make it public,"" Clinton told reporters then. As Obama struggles to appeal to white, working-class males, he hopes Clinton can woo those voters in key Southern and Rust Belt states. You wouldn't call the two men best of friends, but the lines of communication between the White House and the Clinton circle are open, sources in both camps say. But even as the two are now on the same team, they're not always reading from the same playbook. While the Obama campaign tries to make a liability of presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney's past as the head of a private equity firm, Clinton recently punched a hole in what has been a central campaign argument. ""I think he had a good business career,"" Clinton said of Romney last week on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" ""There's no question that in terms of getting up and going to the office and, you know, basically performing the essential functions of the office, the man who has been governor and had a sterling business career crosses the qualification threshold."" Romney smiles at Clinton compliment . Clinton later clarified his remarks, but the damage was done.

When I started PostSecret as an art project in 2004, I had no idea that this simple project would turn my life upside-down and offer such a fascinating peek into the rich hidden world that we share but don't talk about. I printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards inviting strangers to share an artful secret on a postcard -- something they had never told anyone before -- and mail it to me anonymously. When they started arriving I began scanning them and posting them on the web. The idea began spreading virally with people buying and making their own postcards. Today www.postsecret.com is the most visited advertisement-free blog in the world with more than 500 million hits. Most fascinating to me are the stories behind the secrets or the intimate connections that can happen between people when they share secrets. TED.com: The web's secret stories . When I posted a secret from someone who confesses to thinking about jumping from the Golden Gate Bridge, PostSecret Blog readers sprang to action creating a Facebook group page called, Please Don't Jump. They posted encouraging pictures and shared their own inspiring stories of hope. 60,000 people joined the group in 10 days. The next week the San Francisco City Council proclaimed the first annual ""Please Don't Jump Day."" Shortly after that the PostSecret community created the most comprehensive directory of suicide prevention hotlines in the world. Sharing Secrets can be transformative and this project has changed my life. I learned early on that there are two kinds of secrets; the ones we keep from others and the ones we hide from ourselves. This project has helped me uncover secrets from my past that were haunting me. I have written my secrets on postcards, mailed them to myself, and spoken to my family about them for the first time.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, speaking early Wednesday in Afghanistan at the tail end of a surprise visit there, discussed how the war will end and promised a steady drawdown of U.S. troops. Obama committed to pulling 23,000 troops out of the country by the end of summer and sticking to the 2014 deadline to turn security fully over to the Afghan government. He said that NATO will set a goal this month for Afghan forces to be in the lead for combat operations next year. ""We will not build permanent bases in this country, nor will we be patrolling its cities and mountains. That will be the job of the Afghan people,"" the president said during a speech at Bagram Air Base. Read extensive excerpts of the speech . His unannounced trip was Obama's third visit to Afghanistan since taking office. It coincided with the first anniversary of the U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden in neighboring Pakistan, and comes as Obama is fighting for re-election. Hours after Obama left the country, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force reported a loud explosion in the capital, Kabul. Gen. Mohammad Ayoub Salangi, Kabul chief of police, told CNN it was a suicide car bomb. The blast killed five people outside a compound known as Green Village, according Sediq Seddiqi, a spokesman for Afghan Interior Ministry. An undetermined number of others also were injured. The president promised not to keep troops in harm's way ""a single day longer than is absolutely required for our national security,"" but promised to ""finish the job"" and ""end this war responsibly."" Obama spoke of a ""negotiated peace,"" and said his administration has been in direct talks with the Taliban. ""We've made it clear that they can be a part of this future if they break with al Qaeda, renounce violence, and abide by Afghan laws,"" he said. Finally, the president vowed: ""This time of war began in Afghanistan, and this is where it will end."" Earlier in his trip, Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai signed an agreement outlining cooperation between their countries once the U.S.-led international force withdraws in 2014. Some U.S. forces will remain in a post-war Afghanistan as military advisers, but both U.S. and Afghan officials have yet to decide how many troops will continue supporting the Afghan military, and for how long. See reactions to Obama's surprise trip . At a signing ceremony for the Strategic Partnership Agreement, Obama said that neither country asked for the war that began more than a decade ago, but now they would work in partnership for a peaceful future. ""There will be difficult days ahead, but as we move forward in our transition, I'm confident that Afghan forces will grow stronger; the Afghan people will take control of their future,"" Obama said. Addressing a concern in Afghanistan that the United States will abandon the country once its troops leave, Obama said, ""With this agreement, I am confident that the Afghan people will understand that the United States will stand by them."" He later added that the United States ""did not come here to claim resources or to claim territory. We came here with a very clear mission to destroy al Qaeda,"" referring to the terrorist organization responsible for the September 11, 2001, attacks. Obama's address came nine years to the day after then-President George W. Bush delivered his ""Mission Accomplished"" speech aboard the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, announcing the end of major combat operations in Iraq. Karzai offered his thanks to the American people for helping Afghanistan, and the presidents shook hands after signing the document in the atrium of the King's Residence, part of the Presidential Palace in Kabul. ""This agreement will close the season of the past 10 years and is going to open an equal relationship season. With the signing of this agreement, we are starting a phase between two sovereign and independent countries that will be based on mutual respect, mutual commitments and mutual friendship,"" Karzai said. Obama warned the Afghan people and, later, U.S. troops he met with, of difficult days ahead. In remarks to troops at Bagram, Obama sounded emotional as he said that soldiers could see friends get hurt or killed as the mission winds down. ""There's going to heartbreak and pain and difficulty ahead, but there's a light on the horizon because of the sacrifices you've made,"" he said. The security risks in Afghanistan were evident from the secretive nature and timing of the trip. Obama landed in Afghanistan in the cover of darkness, and the signing ceremony occurred in the late evening. Back in the United States, politicians reacted to the president's visit -- some with praise, others claiming it was politically motivated. Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney said, ""I am pleased that President Obama has returned to Afghanistan. Our troops and the American people deserve to hear from our president about what is at stake in this war. Success in Afghanistan is vital to our nation's security. It would be a tragedy for Afghanistan and a strategic setback for America if the Taliban returned to power and once again created a sanctuary for terrorists."" Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, was less supportive. ""Clearly, this trip is campaign-related. We've seen recently that President Obama has visited college campuses in an attempt to win back the support of that age group since he has lost it over the last three years. Similarly, this trip to Afghanistan is an attempt to shore up his national security credentials, because he has spent the past three years gutting our military,"" he said in a statement. The Strategic Partnership Agreement provides a framework for the U.S.-Afghanistan partnership for the decade after the U.S. and allied troop withdrawal, according to senior administration officials who briefed reporters on the flight. Specific levels of U.S. forces and funding are not set in the agreement and will be determined by the United States in consultation with allies, the officials said on condition of not being identified. Noting the anniversary of the bin Laden mission, the officials called it a resonant day for the Afghan and American people. More than 130,000 troops from 50 countries serve in Afghanistan, according to the NATO-led International Security and Assistance Force. The United States is the biggest contributor, providing about 90,000 troops, followed by the United Kingdom (9,500), Germany (4,800) and France (3,600). The war that began in 2001 is increasingly unpopular in the United States, with the latest CNN/ORC International poll in late March showing 25% of respondents supporting it and 72% opposing it. More than 2,700 troops from the United States and its partners have died in the war, the majority of them American. In 2011, the United States outlined its plan to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. The move was followed by withdrawal announcements by most of the NATO nations. Last week, Afghan National Security Adviser Rangin Daftar Spanta and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker initialed a text that outlined the kind of relationship the two countries want in the decade following the NATO withdrawal. The deal had been long expected after Washington and Kabul found compromises over the thorny issues of ""night raids"" by U.S. forces on Afghan homes and the transfer of U.S. detainees to Afghan custody. It seeks to create an enduring partnership that prevents the Taliban from waiting until the U.S. withdrawal to try to regain power, the senior administration officials said. Obama visited Afghanistan in March 2010 and returned in December of the same year. He also visited Afghanistan in 2008 as a presidential candidate. CNN's Tom Cohen, Barbara Starr, Keating Holland, Nick Paton Walsh and journalist Masoud Popalzai contributed to this report.","NEW: Car bomb in Kabul kills 5 after Obama visit .

"(CNN) -- Veronica Campbell-Brown knows a thing or two about upsetting the odds. The 29-year-old Jamaican sprinter has had to overcome grinding poverty to become one of the greatest Olympians her country has ever produced. After being spotted running barefoot at a school sports day, Campbell-Brown burst on to the track and field scene when she won silver as part of Jamaica's 4x100 meters sprint team at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. That was just the start. She went on to win gold in the 200 meters at both the 2004 Athens and 2008 Beijing Olympics. Now she faces her toughest test at her fourth Games. CNN Photos: On the fringe of an Olympic dream . If she emerges triumphant at London's Olympic Stadium in August, she will be the first person in history to win three consecutive gold medals in the distance. She is in good form too. Last year she ran the 100 meters in 10.76 seconds, the second quickest time in history. CNN's Human to Hero caught up with the Trelawny-born sprinter -- who hails from the same Jamaican parish that has given the world champion men's sprinter Usain Bolt -- to talk about London 2012, her rivals and why a third gold would be the icing on the cake. Growing up in poverty . ""I have five brothers, four sisters, so you can just imagine the competition in the house. It helped me be very competitive, strong and independent,"" Campbell-Brown said. ""I used to race the boys and win. So I knew I had a special gift and should work on improving it. ""When I was very young in primary school, we had a lot of sports days. I won the double there running barefoot. My coach and teacher said, 'You're very talented.' He recommended a high school, the 'Sprint Factory' (Camperdown High School). From that moment I came to the realization he was telling the truth."" Are yams the secret of Trelawny's success? Campbell-Brown's birthplace has produced many top runners, including triple Olympic champion Bolt, U.S. athlete Sanya Richards-Ross and disgraced Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson. ""There's a lot of sprinters that come from Trelawny, it's so different, the country air. When I was growing up I didn't have central heating. I'd have to go and collect water from the river. I used to do a lot of walking,"" Campbell-Brown said. ""I think it's just hard work and determination. Jamaica is full of so many talents. My parents were farmers and used to plant their own yams that are starchy high in carbs. We took it right from the ground."" Life after winning gold in Athens . ""I felt blessed. I don't think anything I've achieved has changed me. I am the same person. My personality doesn't change. You have to believe it to achieve it ... I visualized it and made it happen."" On giving back . Campbell-Brown has a charitable foundation aimed at empowering Jamaican girls through sport. ""I believe in giving back. When I was younger so many people helped me to become the woman I am today. So I feel, because I am in the position to help someone, I need to do it,"" she said. ""If I can touch just one life I will help someone, to try and help females in Jamaica to get a high school education, mentor them and make sure they keep a level head and point them in the right direction."" History beckons at London 2012? As well as seeking a record third consecutive 200m gold, Campbell-Brown is also trying to qualify for the 100m, in which she was world champion in 2007 and runner-up in 2005 and 2011. ""There are a lot of great, talented women out there, hungry to perform at their best for the Olympics. There can only be one winner. It will be quite interesting. Everyone will have a great time watching it,"" she said. ""The Olympics are the highlight, the most recognized event in track and field. Everybody waits for the Olympics. It's very important to me. I'll be going for a fourth time. ""I've never won the 100 meters at the Olympics. If I win the 200 meters for a third time I will be the first woman to achieve that in history."" ""It feels good. When I was a little girl my dream was always to get an individual gold medal. I have two, which is more than I asked for. A third will be the icing on the cake.""","CNN talks to Jamaican double 200-meter gold medalist Veronica Campbell-Brown .

"Washington (CNN) -- In a rare public appearance, former President George W. Bush spoke Tuesday to dissidents from countries including China, Cuba and Syria, to honor their attempts to bring democracy to the world. In a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, he focused on the upheaval in the Middle East that has occurred since he left office in 2009. ""In the Arab Spring, we have sent the broadest challenge to authoritarian rule since the collapse of Soviet Communism,"" Bush said. ""The idea that Arab people are somehow content with oppression has been discredited forever. Yet, we've also seen instability, uncertainty and the revenge of brutal rulers."" During the former president's eight years in office, he reacted to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks by authorizing U.S. troops to fight in Afghanistan. He also sent troops into Iraq, bringing about the downfall of Saddam Hussein's government -- with Bush saying promoting democracy there could spread freedom across the Middle East. ""Some look at the risks inherent in democratic change, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, and find the dangers too great. America, they argue, should be content with supporting the flawed leaders they know in the name of stability. But, in the long run, this foreign policy approach is not realistic,"" he told a friendly crowd at the Council on Foreign Relations. One of the world's most famous dissidents joined the event via Skype from Myanmar, also known as Burma. Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 during her house arrest for pro-democracy activities in her home country. This year, she has been elected to the parliament there. ""Her example shows people everywhere that political isolation and prison cannot silence the call for liberty,"" said former first lady Laura Bush during her introduction. While serving as first lady, she voiced her support for Suu Kyi's opposition party in Myanmar, in one of her rare forays into international policy. Suu Kyi confirmed that she has recently received a new passport from her government and is making plans to travel to Oslo, Norway, to pick up her Nobel prize. In a speech Monday at the Center for Strategic and International Studies Sen. John McCain said the United States should look at suspending sanctions against Myanmar as the government has made ""real progress"" toward reform. ""This would not be a lifting of sanctions, just a suspension. And this step, as well as any additional easing of sanctions, would depend on continued progress and reform in Burma,"" said the Arizona Republican. Suu Kyi was amenable to this idea. ""I am not against the suspension of sanctions as long as the people of the United States feel that this is the right thing to do at the moment,"" she said via Skype. She did warn that ""democratization is not irreversible"" and that her country could still slip back from its current reforms. She closed with some words of encouragement for human rights advocates around the world saying, ""Persevere. You will get there in the end, just go on."" Other dissidents at the event included Xiqiu ""Bob"" Fu from China, who was a student during the Tiananmen Square protests in China in 1989; Normando Hernandez, who was held prisoner by the Cuban government; and Ammar Abdulhamid who was exiled from Syria in 2005 for criticizing President Bashir Assad. The event was held to launch the Freedom Collection, a program under the auspices of the George W. Bush Presidential Center that documents the stories of dissidents from around the world who risk their lives to move their countries toward freedom.","Former president hails the Arab Spring's ""challenge to authoritarian rule""

"(CNN)  -- Cyber criminals are setting snares that move at the speed of news. Savvy cyber criminals are taking advantage of our increasing reliance on computers and the Internet. Panda Security, a Spain-based antivirus maker, has been monitoring an onslaught of links with malicious software, or ""malware,"" on Twitter that tag hot topics such as the Air France crash, the NBA finals, ""American Idol"" runner-up Adam Lambert and the new iPhone. ""Cyber criminals have been targeting Twitter users by creating thousands of messages (tweets) embedded with words involving trending topics and malicious URLs,"" Sean-Paul Correll, a threat researcher for Panda Labs, wrote recently on a blog for the company. The growing sophistication of malware attacks mirrors the growing threat -- and cash -- generated by online crime. Already, cyber crime is estimated to cost companies and consumers more than $100 billion worldwide. Some officials claim it has now eclipsed illegal drugs as a criminal moneymaker. ""It's very seldom reported ... if discovered by companies, they generally don't want the public to know they've been had,"" said Eugene Spafford, a computer security specialist at Purdue University who has advised two U.S. presidents and numerous companies and government agencies. Cyber crime is one of the few industries benefiting from the financial crisis. Last year, antivirus maker McAfee saw a 500 percent increase in malware types -- more than the company had seen in the previous five years combined. In the United States, the FBI reported a 33 percent increase in Internet crime last year. Companies lost an average of $4.6 million in intellectual property last year, according to a survey of 1000 firms worldwide by Purdue University and McAfee. ""As the economy has declined, we've seen the threat landscape increase,"" David DeWalt, president and CEO of McAfee, recently told Richard Quest for CNN International's ""Quest Means Business."" That increase has helped antivirus makers such as McAfee snare record returns -- the company's first quarter profits were 21 percent higher than same period last year. But companies and governments find themselves in a losing war with Web-savvy criminals, experts say. ""The fundamental fact is cyber criminals are highly organized with sophisticated corporate structures and business chains,"" said Michael Fraser, director of the Communications Law Centre at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia. ""They have R&D departments, strong distribution networks and Web sites for the discerning cyber criminal,"" Fraser said. On these Web sites, would-be criminals can purchase toolkits to learn how to side step security measures or create their own ""botnet"" -- referring to software that can, unbeknownst to victims, turn their computers into spamming foot-soldiers for criminal networks. One Web site advertises software that can capture information for a popular Internet secured-payment provider for $500 -- discounted to $400 for the first 100 buyers. Skimmed credit card numbers and other personal-identity information stolen from computers also can be found for sale on Web sites, Fraser said. ""When police shut these Web sites down, they just mushroom up some other place,"" he said. Although the techniques of cyber crime have evolved, online criminals prey on human vulnerabilities like criminals throughout the ages. In the digital age, that means tempting with free downloads, money schemes and pornography. The range of tools used by cyber criminals reveals the quick evolution of the industry. Viruses -- the first generation of the computer culprits -- are used for the computer equivalent of vandalism, as the malicious programs replicate, spread and damage computers. ""When the company was set up, we were seeing two or three new viruses a week,"" said Mahendra Negi, chief financial officer of Tokyo-based antivirus maker Trend Micro. ""Now there's a new one every two-and-a-half seconds. ""With the arrival of spam in 2001 and 2002, the big difference was it was commercial malware,"" Negi said. ""Once money became involved, the level of sophistication raised a hundred-fold."" Now the biggest threats include ""phishing"" schemes and ""botnet"" attacks. Phishing is where criminals masquerade as a legitimate business or Web site and trick victims into revealing passwords, credit card information and other personal data. Botnet attackers commandeer personal computers as part of a large network of ""zombie"" computers that, on command, target companies for spam attacks to cripple IT capabilities. Botnets -- some of which are large enough to deploy tens of billions of spam e-mails a day -- are often used in extortion schemes. ""They ring up the IT manager of a company and say, 'Pay us a million or we'll take you down',"" said Fraser, who has worked with companies victimized by botnet attacks. Companies often pay up and shut up, computer experts say, rather than report the crime and garner publicity that may hurt their corporate reputation. And unlike prankster virus-makers, these malware makers are determined to stay hidden. ""Once it became a business, then (cyber criminals) began to look at what companies like us were doing, and figure out weaknesses,"" he said. ""They are very customer friendly ... they sell updates, they will highlight what the product does and what antivirus software can't detect them. Adding to the difficulty is the legal situation that in many jurisdictions, it is not illegal to create or sell malware. ""It's like the arms industry ... it's not a crime to build and sell them,"" Negi said. And because of the transnational nature of the crime, it's extremely difficult to prosecute. A scan of 500 headlines on Internet-related arrests from newspapers around the world the past two years found about 90 percent were related to child-pornography cases. ""Child pornography is easier to prosecute because it is possible to find the evidence on the perpetrator's computer systems,"" said Spafford of Purdue University. Cyber-criminal networks are as porous as the Internet itself. ""There are multiple jurisdictions and unless it's an ongoing crime that uses the same path all the time, the trail goes cold quickly,"" Spafford said. ""I may be able to trace back to a computer system, if I'm lucky, or trace it back to a cyber cafe -- but how do I know who was behind it?"" Often criminal networks are run in countries such as Russia and China, where government officials turn a blind eye to these activities -- so long as their victims reside outside the host country, Spafford said. ""For the host countries, that's dangerous ... it's kind of like breeding tigers in the back yard and saying, 'Well, they haven't hurt anyone here yet,'"" he said. ""Mexico is a wonderful example ... they tolerated drug smugglers for years, and now it's such a major problem and incredibly painful and costly to run them out. ""I'm not saying (cyber criminals) are involved in physical violence, but it's not out of the realm of possibility,"" he said. ""What are they doing with all that money?""","Some officials say cyber crime has eclipsed drug trade as a money maker .

"Whilst the energy grids we rely on to provide us with cheap and reliable electricity may have been fit for purpose in the 20th century, it is now abundantly clear that the design of 21st century energy networks will have to be very different. In Europe, the foundations for a secure, flexible and more energy efficient future are already being laid. The SmartGrids project will transform how electricity is supplied in Europe. Instead of centralized power generation, new suppliers will be linked up providing new trading opportunities for businesses and homeowners. Traditional carbon-based power generators are far from efficient. They waste well over half their energy in heat and contribute over a third to total greenhouse emissions. It is now widely accepted that continuing to rely so heavily on such polluting systems would not only spark environmental catastrophe but also economic collapse. With an aging electricity grid, a drive to lower carbon emissions by 2020 and burgeoning new markets in renewable energy, the time was right for Europe's leaders to set about trying to find another way. The result is SmartGrids -- one of many projects set up under the European Union's European Technology Platform (ETP). Combining the expertise of industry, NGO's, scientists and regulators, SmartGrids is proposing a fundamental shift away from traditional energy supply models. Work on the vision of the project started in 2005 and was followed up by the Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) in 2007. This summer will see the publication of the Strategic Deployment Document (SDD) which will take the project a step closer to realization. Duncan Botting, Vice-Chairman of the SmartGrids Advisory Council is currently co-editing the SDD. He spoke to CNN about how the SmartGrids will differ from the old networks and the challenge of replacing the electricity grid across 27 EU states without any loss of power. ""The grids built in the 1950s and 1960s were designed for power to effectively be poured in at the top -- big central generation. This power then went through transmissions systems and then smaller wires for distribution to the home,"" Botting told CNN. Instead of energy just being pumped one-way down wires and into homes, SmartGrids envisions a two-way flow of electricity, where customers -- big and small -- not only receive energy but also generate it themselves and, when necessary, make it available to the grid. It's hard enough trying to create a reliable system that is able to manage this complex interaction between power generators. But when you throw in the complication of 27 member states, each with their own networks, all at different levels of maturity you start to realize the scale of the task at hand. ""It takes up to 40 years to completely replace a grid,"" Botting said. ""In order to get this right we need to change things at the right pace. We're not changing the grid like for like but with smarter more intelligent bits of kit."" An example of this is the automated regional active network management system -- Aura-NMS for short. A collaborative project between engineering company ABB -- where Botting heads up technology and business development -- EDF Energy, Scottish Power and seven leading UK universities. ""Aura-NMS is trying to take a slightly different view of life,"" Botting said. ""If you go back 50 years we used to have local control centers around the networks, with people there telling us what and where a problem was. Aura-NMS is trying to mimic this but also enable microgrids which can be maintained in their own right, away from the main grid."" Botting wishes to stress that this is a very simplified explanation, but, in a nutshell, the idea is to change from what he describes as a 'passive' network -- one designed to cope with a peak load -- to an 'active' network which balances multiple power generation with demand, resulting in vastly improved energy efficiency. The push towards more intelligent electricity grids is a global phenomenon. The United States is currently researching an Intelligrid and Botting recently visited Taiwan for an international symposium on the issue. Jeremy Rifkin, President of the Foundation on Economic Trends, is a big supporter of SmartGrids and believes that new inter-connected power grids mark the beginning of what he describes as the 'Third Industrial Revolution'. The first European SmartGrids are still a way off. But how does Botting think you and I might experience the system come 2050. ""The idea,"" Botting explains, ""would be that instead of having a meter in your house, you would now have a smart gateway which would be programmable."" He sites scenarios where consumers might, for example, want to sell some surplus energy from their house back to the grid. ""The ability to trade will be automated,"" says Botting. ""You choose what you want to do. ""At the other end of the stream, wind farm generators for example, instead of being told that they are generating too much energy because the grid cannot cope, there will be an arbitration which goes on automatically to maximize their throughput and maybe back off using a high carbon energy source."" Botting is well placed to offer a balanced assessment of the tasks that lie ahead. He combines a business role -- soon to take up a new post as Managing Director at ITI Energy -- with academic duties -- he is a visiting professor at both Imperial College, London and Strathclyde University in Glasgow. ""The business case for a government is different to that of a CEO. We are trying to make sure that the right things are in there for each of those audiences,"" he said. He admits that nobody would be considering SmartGrids in usual economic terms, but climate change has changed the game. And he's convinced that advances in renewable energy technology -- a key aspect of the SmartGrids vision -- will keep pace with the project. ""You can't limit your imagination by what you have today,"" he said. ""If we are going to get security of supply with low carbon and renewable resources you then have to start looking at how they will be delivered to the end user. What are the economics if you don't do it? Well, you might not have a business, or the lights might go out."" Watch Jeremy Rifkin explain about how energy grids of the future will work here.","The EU hopes SmartGrids will transform Europe's electricity network in 21st century .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Martina Hingis has been given a two-year ban after testing positive for cocaine, the International Tennis Federation announced on Friday. Hingis must forfeit $130,000 prize money and ranking points earned at Wimbledon and subsequent events. The 27-year-old Swiss player was found to have tested positive for a metabolite of cocaine while competing at Wimbledon last year, the ITF said in a statement published on its Web site. At the time the allegations first surfaced last November, Hingis dismissed the test results, calling the claims ""horrendous"" and ""monstrous."" However, following a two-day hearing last month, an independent anti-doping tribunal confirmed the test results, the federation said. The tribunal rejected the suggestion made on Hingis' behalf that there were doubts about the identity or integrity of the sample attributed to the tennis star, the statement said. The former world number one spent three years out of the sport before returning to the tour in 2006, and won three titles in Kolkata, Roma and Tokyo. The federation said Hingis would have to repay $130,000 prize money and ranking points won since last year's Wimbledon. The federation said the ban would commence from October 1, 2007. Hingis, a five-time Grand Slam champion and former Wimbledon winner, announced her retirement from the sport at the time the allegations emerged. ""I have no desire to spend the next seven years fighting doping officials,"" she told a press conference in Zurich at the time. ""I'm frustrated and angry because I believe I'm 100 percent innocent and accusations such as these don't provide me with the motivation to continue,"" she added. WTA chief executive Larry Scott said in a statement: ""We are saddened by this news as Martina has meant so much to fans the world over and made many positive contributions to the sport."" But he insisted that the WTA Tour fully supported the tribunal. ""We support and will enforce the ruling of this independent tribunal under the Tennis Anti-Doping Program,"" he added. Hingis has three weeks to appeal the decision. E-mail to a friend .","Martina Hingis is suspended for two years after testing positive for cocaine .

"(CNN) -- It was dubbed ""mission impossible"" by one of their own mothers, but Serbia's women tennis players are now looking forward to the country's historic first Fed Cup final appearance. Former world No. 1s Jelena Jankovic and Ana Ivanovic won their reverse singles ties in Moscow on Sunday before Serbia lost the dead doubles rubber to leave the score at 3-2. But that defeat could not take the gloss off an emotional semifinal victory over a Russia team that has won the tournament four times in the past decade. Yugoslavia reached the semifinals in 1984, but the Serbs had never made it to the last four since first competing as an independent nation in 2007. ""The journey has been very long -- five years long -- so I'm very happy to make it to the final,"" Serbian captain Dejan Vranes said on the Fed Cup website. ""They played very good. We did everything possible to prepare for the match and I think we deserve the victory."" Despite the Russians missing top players Maria Sharapova and Vera Zvonareva, Jankovic's mother Snezana said of the win: ""It's amazing. Coming to Russia was mission impossible."" The women will now be hoping to follow in the footsteps of their male compatriots, who reached the Davis Cup final for the first time in 2010 and -- led by current world No. 1 Novak Djokovic -- won the title. ""I have goosebumps because it's so exciting for us,"" world No. 17 Jankovic said after her decisive win 6-1 6-4 over two-time grand slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova. ""We've come a long way. I remember those days we would play in the lower groups, so it's so exciting for us to be in the final and playing for the trophy. I'm very proud of our team and everyone who has helped us."" Ivanovic, now ranked 15th, lost to Kuznetsova on Saturday but redeemed herself by beating Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 3-6 6-0 6-3 in Sunday's opening match. ""I didn't have a great night of sleep last night. I felt a lot of pressure after what happened yesterday,"" the 2008 French Open champion said after her win. ""I was a little bit tense in the beginning of the match against Anastasia. She was hardly missing a ball and every shot was a winner. I just thought: 'Just find your rhythm, this set is gone.' ""I stayed composed and started playing more aggressively and it worked."" In November's final, the Serbs will face reigning champions the Czech Republic, who triumphed over Italy 4-1 in the other semifinal. World No. 3 Petra Kvitova helped seal the Czech victory in the third match with a 6-4 7-6 (7-1) win over 2010 French Open champion Francesca Schiavone for her second victory of the tie. ""Francesca played unbelievable tennis,"" last year's Wimbledon champion said. ""Every Fed Cup I'm playing I'm nervous, so I'm really happy to win today. It's an unbelievable feeling -- I really wanted to be in the final again. The crowd was great, and I hope everyone who came to support us this weekend comes to the final too."" The 22-year-old has struggled to repeat her stellar 2011 performances this year, struggling for form and fitness since losing in the semifinals of the Australian Open in January. Kvitova will return to the WTA Tour circuit this week in Stuttgart following an intensive training program in Turkey. The Stuttgart clay event will be headed by world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka, while second-ranked Sharapova is also in the field along with Ivanovic, Jankovic, Polish fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska and last year's runner-up Caroline Wozniacki.","Serbia in historic first Fed Cup final after beating four-time champs Russia 3-2 .

"(CNN) -- Sizing up the magnitude of Mexico's obesity problem is as simple as visiting a clothing manufacturer. At Arush, a clothing factory in Mexico City, the changing demand has modified production. Buyers, including Mexican giant retailers like Soriana and Liverpool, are increasingly asking for ""large"" and ""extra large"" sizes, which have all but replaced production of ""small"" and ""medium."" Designer Adriana Moreno, who works at Arush, said they're simply adapting to Mexico's new reality: an explosion of overweight and obese people, mostly in the last three decades. ""In our market, I can tell you we've had a 50% growth in sales of large and extra-large sizes in the last three years,"" Moreno said. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 69.5% of the Mexican population aged 15 and older is overweight or obese. This is the highest rate in the world, even higher than in the United States -- which historically had the highest rate -- and the United Kingdom, which has the highest in Europe. The Mexican government launched a campaign last year urging people to exercise, drink more water, and eat fruits and vegetables. President Felipe CalderÃ³n said that ""since 1980, the percentage of overweight or obese Mexicans has tripled."" The problem starts early: 4.5 million children between the ages of 5 and 11 are already overweight. Many school districts have banned junk food in their facilities, but it's readily available right outside, much to the chagrin of parents. ""You can see how many stands there are outside. And they're all selling junk food! I think they should also control what they sell out here,"" Daniela PiÃ±a said as she waited for her child outside a grammar school in Mexico City's Doctores neighborhood. Adela Garcia, a stay-at-home mother, said parental responsibility plays a vital role in solving the problem. ""It really starts at home,"" she said. ""We as parents have to take that kind of food away from children so that they eat healthier."" Mexico's Institute for Public Health reports that the number of overweight or obese school-aged children increased from 18.4% in 1999 to 26.2% in 2006. It also says that diabetes -- of which obesity is a contributing factor -- has become the No. 1 cause of death in Mexico. Other statistics provided by the institute are very telling. Mexicans drink 160.1 liters (42.3 gallons) of soft drinks per year. The institute also says that school-aged children get at least a fifth of their calories from drinks with a high content of sugar and other sweeteners. ""We trust that the public interest will prevail over private interests and that the federal government will do, under the law, everything possible so that our proposals are quickly implemented,"" the institute says. Their proposals include increasing physical activity in schools and improving nutrition guidelines. Back at the clothes factory, Adriana Moreno is faced with a challenge: pleasing people in spite of their size. ""It's a very demanding market, very demanding. People are always trying to look good, not seem so overweight. They look for a beautiful garment, a good design that doesn't make them look heavier than they really are,"" Moreno said. The war on drugs has killed 30,000 people in the last four years, and violence is front-page news in major newspapers across Mexico. But obesity, excess weight and their related health problems claim almost five times more lives than the war against drug cartels. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, individual prevention programs could avoid as many as 47,000 deaths from chronic diseases every year. Mexico's Health Ministry reports that obesity and excess weight cost the country $5.5 billion in expenses associated with treating people with diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and heart disease. CNN's Rey Rodriguez in Mexico City contributed to this report.","Diabetes is the No. 1 killer in Mexico, health agency says .
Nearly 70% of the population is overweight or obese .
Mexicans drink more than 42 gallons of soft drinks per person each year ."
"(CNN) -- A top Mexican official says Mexico's drug policy is not a ""war"" against drug cartels, but a comprehensive strategy of the federal government to dismantle criminal organizations while at the same time strengthening institutions. In a blog published by the Office of Mexican President Felipe Calderon, National Security Spokesman Alejandro Poire says the main objectives of the Mexican national security strategy are to strengthen the rule of law and reduce crime. ""This is not 'the government's war against drugs,' but the fight of all Mexicans to build an authentic security, based on the rule of law and justice,"" Poire said. President Felipe Calderon's drug policy has come under scrutiny as violence increases. The Mexican government's estimate indicates more than 35,000 people have died in drug-related violence since Calderon took office in December 2006 for a six-year term. Critics in Mexico and abroad have repeatedly said it is time for the Mexican government to reassess its hard-line drug strategy, because it has become counterproductive. Poire, who recently spoke on the issue of drug violence in Mexico at Harvard University in Boston, addressed the criticism on his blog. ""A policy of omission, simulation, or even worse, of negotiation (with the cartels]) would have been negligent and criminal,"" Poire said. ""It would have postponed the effort to seek solutions much longer and left the population at the mercy of organized crime."" His comments were published six days after the U.S. Department of State broadened its travel warning for Mexico, advising American citizens to avoid certain areas and steer clear of driving at night. The advisory singles out 11 Mexican states, including border states like Sonora, Chihuahua and Tamaulipas. The warning issued Friday strongly urges Americans to ""travel only during daylight hours throughout Mexico, to avoid isolated roads and to use toll roads whenever possible."" It also notes, ""There's no evidence that U.S. tourists have been targeted by criminal elements due to their citizenship."" According to the U.S. State Department, 150,000 Americans cross the border into Mexico every day for study, tourism or business and at least 1 million U.S. citizens live in Mexico. In a recent interview with CNN, a top Mexican tourism official said that in spite of the violence, tourism in Mexico last year was ""very robust."" Rodolfo Lopez Negrete, chief operating officer of the Mexico Tourism Bureau, said, ""Major tourism destinations that we have in Mexico, whether you refer to sun-and-beach resorts or inland destinations, those are perfectly safe."" Lopez Negrete said violence mostly occurs in ""border towns with the United States, in the northeastern section of our country."" However, violence in the beach resort of Acapulco has dramatically increased in the last three years. According to the Acapulco morgue, there were 1,010 violent deaths in the Pacific coastal city in 2010.","Fight aims to dismantle drug cartels, strengthen institutions, official says .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Moammar Gadhafi's military machine pounded the western city of Misrata again Tuesday as France and Britain called for beefed-up NATO airstrikes to stop such attacks on the Libyan people. Witnesses reported heavy shelling in central Misrata, besieged for weeks and the scene of some of the worst fighting in the Libyan conflict. At least 10 people were killed and 30 others wounded in the heavy shelling, a doctor operating in two central clinics told CNN. The doctor, identified only as Dr. Hakim for safety reasons, said medical teams are exhausted from treating the wounded. Rebel fighter Moaath al-Misrati told CNN the shelling came after rebels killed several of Gadhafi's snipers. ""We are expecting a ground offensive by the Gadhafi forces any time now,"" he said. The witnesses said all telephone communications, including mobile service, had been cut. British Foreign Secretary William Hague and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe both called Tuesday for NATO to get more aggressive in Libya, and a rebel leader issued a plea for the international community to carry out the U.N. Security Council resolution of March 17, which calls for ""all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack"" in the North African country. Hague told reporters in Brussels, Belgium, that ""a huge amount has been achieved in Libya, but clearly there is more to be done."" Juppe said NATO needs to fully embrace the role it accepted -- to protect Libyan civilians from Gadhafi's forces. ""NATO wanted to take charge of the military operations, we accepted it,"" Juppe said on France Info radio. ""It has to carry out its role today, which means to prevent Gadhafi from using heavy weapons to bombard the population."" Specifically, Juppe mentioned the attacks on Misrata, where on Monday at least five civilians -- including two toddlers, a 75-year-old man and an Algerian worker -- were killed and more than 20 people wounded in mortar attacks, according to witnesses. In Benghazi, Abdel Hafiz Ghoga, the deputy chairman of the Transitional National Council, issued an ""urgent statement"" calling on the international community ""to intervene and stop the massacres that Gadhafi promised in Misrata, and to implement the UN resolution in any possible means."" Ghoga told CNN that the opposition has submitted a wish list of military equipment to Qatar and France. He said the list was compiled by rebel military leaders and he didn't know exactly what was being requested. Last week, when asked by CNN's Reza Sayah which countries were providing rebels with weapons and training, Ghoga said, ""We are in communication with our brothers in Qatar and also with our brothers in the Egyptian republic and with our friends in Italy and France."" He indicated in the interview that the weapons were on their way to Libya. Meanwhile, Libya's most high-profile defector flew from Britain to Qatar Tuesday for talks on how to break the deadly impasse in his nation. Former Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa flew to the Qatari capital, Doha, to meet with government officials and Libyan opposition leaders ahead of the first meeting Wednesday of the Libya Contact Group, formed in London last month and charged with implementing United Nations resolutions. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will also attend. In a news conference in Benghazi, Ghoga did not explicity reject the idea of opposition leaders' meeting with Koussa in Doha, but said such a meeting was ""not on the agenda."" In an earlier interview with the BBC, Koussa had expressed concern that the situation in Libya was spiraling downward into a grinding war, in the mold of the conflict in Somalia. Koussa, who fled Libya last month and sought safe haven in Britain after resigning his post in Gadhafi's regime, urged all parties to avoid plunging Libya into a civil war. ""This will lead to (much bloodshed), and Libya will be a new Somalia,"" Koussa told the BBC. Koussa, a longtime Gadhafi confidant and a former Libyan intelligence chief, also told BBC, ""The solution in Libya will come from the Libyans themselves through discussion and democratic dialogue."" did not explicitly reject the idea of meeting with Libya's  held a press conference on Tuesday and when asked if the opposition would be open to a meeting with Moussa Koussa - Libya's former Foreign Minister - in Doha, the Deputy Chairman of the Transitional National Council did not explicitly reject the idea. He told reporters a meeting with Moussa Koussa in Doha ""was not on the agenda."" An African Union attempt at forging peace fell flat when Ghoga and fellow rebel leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil rejected it on grounds that it did not provide any solutions to violence against the Libyan people. Gadhafi had agreed in principle to stop hostilities and allow outside forces to help keep the peace, his government and African Union mediators said Monday in a joint statement after a meeting in Tripoli. The African Union plan announced Monday did not address whether Gadhafi will step down, nor is it binding. According to the memorandum detailed by Ramtane Lamara, the African Union's commissioner for peace and security, the plan had four elements: . -- An immediate end to all fighting . -- Libyan authorities' cooperation ""to facilitate the diligent delivery of humanitarian assistance"" -- The protection of foreign nationals in Libya . -- The start of talks involving various Libyan authorities, including opposition figures, with the aim of setting up ""an inclusive transition period"" to adopt and implement ""political reforms necessary for the elimination of the causes of the current crisis."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday that Washington is still ""waiting to get a full readout"" from participants in the African Union's peace mission in Libya. ""We've made it very clear that we want to see a cease-fire,"" Clinton said. But she said there also must be, among other things, a resumption of water, electricity and other services to Libyan cities that have been ""brutalized by Gadhafi's forces."" She also reiterated the U.S. position that Gadhafi needs to step down from power. Ghoga, the Transitional National Council's deputy chairman, on Tuesday said rebel forces were ""fighting in the direction of Brega"" from the western gate of the ""completely liberated"" city of Ajdabiya. ""Gadhafi's forces still have some elements in Brega,"" he told reporters. ""We added more security personnel to protect the oil fields in the city because the regime is trying to strand us economically."" ""The situation in Tripoli is very dire,"" Ghoga continued. He said fuel and food there were depleted ""because all fuel is being for the Gadhafi forces' need(s)."" Ghoga also claimed that ""thousands of demonstrators"" opposing the regime were arrested in the capital and that ""a large number of them were executed in the Saladin military academy,"" but didn't provide further details. CNN could not independently confirm those claims. He added that on Monday, ""there was a massive demonstration in Fashloum in Tripoli, and the majority were hiding their faces, fearing arrest.""

"(CNN) -- The FBI is investigating the death in Mexico of a man who was a U.S. service member, an agency spokesman said Thursday. Jose Gil Hernandez Ramirez was killed Wednesday in Ciudad Juarez. Hernandez was a member of the Texas National Guard, officials said Thursday. Hernandez, a private first class, was a fire direction sensor specialist assigned to Headquarters Battery 3rd Battalion, 133 Field Artillery, the National Guard said. The El Paso, Texas, resident, 22, had been in the Guard since 2007. ""The Texas National Guard family has lost a friend and fellow soldier and he will be missed, but more importantly the soldier's family mourns the loss of a loved one,"" the Guard said in a statement. ""At this time there is no more important and honored duty than to surround the family with our love, and support them through this very difficult time."" Hernandez was a student during the week and reported for National Guard duty on weekends and annual training. The FBI is working closely with the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, said FBI spokesman Michael Martinez, who is based in El Paso, Texas. Hernandez was killed during a drive-by shooting, according to the Chihuahua Attorney General's office. Ciudad Juarez is in the Mexican state of Chihuahua and shares a border with El Paso. Juarez is Mexico's bloodiest city, with more than 2,500 drug-related deaths reported this year. Nationwide, more than 28,000 people have died in drug violence since December 2006, when President Felipe Calderon took office and started his stepped-up campaign against organized crime. Because of the violence, Juarez is considered off-limits for the U.S. military. A memorandum at Fort Bliss in Texas prohibits soldiers from traveling into Chihuahua. In November, a member of the U.S. Air Force was among six people killed when gunmen entered a strip club in Ciudad Juarez and opened fire. Hernandez was standing on the street by a car when he was shot by gunmen about 1 p.m., Mexican authorities said. A second person, Rafael Ramirez Reza, 22, originally from Juarez, was also killed, said Carlos Gonzalez, spokesman for the Chihuahua Attorney General's office. A third person who was not identified was injured in the shooting, Gonzalez said. A local newspaper, El Diario, said Ramirez was negotiating a car sale when he was shot.

"(CNN) -- Doctors in Cuba detected and removed a cancerous tumor from Hugo Chavez's body, the Venezuelan president announced in a speech broadcast on state-run VTV Thursday night. Chavez said he was continuing treatment, but did not specify what that treatment entailed, where the tumor was located or when he would return to Venezuela. The ""abscessed tumor with cancerous cells"" was discovered after doctors had already operated and treated a pelvic abscess, he said. Doctors operated again without any complications and removed the tumor, he said. Chavez said he was ""receiving complementary treatments to combat the different types of cells found,"" and that his condition continued ""evolving satisfactorily."" ""I wanted to speak to you with the sun of the dawn ... I think we have achieved it, thank God,"" he said. Chavez appeared steady but subdued as he spoke, flanked by a large portrait of South American independence hero Simon Bolivar on one side and the Venezuelan flag on the other. He frequently glanced down at his prepared text during the 15-minute speech.The performance showed none of the combative energy that normally characterizes his addresses, where he'll speak extemporaneously for hours on end, skewering his opponents with gusto and sketching out the vision for his ""21st-century socialism."" ""Throughout my life, I've been making the fundamental error of neglecting my health and being reluctant to get checkups,"" he said, explaining how health concerns began to pop up earlier this month while he was in Cuba on a state visit. Chavez closed his speech by saying, ""Now and always, we will live and we will overcome. Thank you very much. Until my return."" He gave no indication of any plans to delegate power during his treatment in Cuba. Venezuelan Vice President Elias Jaua appeared on state television shortly after Chavez's speech. ""There is no time for sadness, but time for reflection, for courage and for work,"" he said, standing beside a group of government ministers. ""Unity is what is required at this time."" Thursday's speech was Chavez's first on the state-run network since doctors in Cuba performed emergency surgery on the Venezuelan leader nearly three weeks ago. The Venezuelan president's typically frequent live television appearances have been absent from the country's airwaves since doctors in Cuba first performed surgery to treat a pelvic abscess June 10. His lengthy stay in Cuba and notable low profile have fueled rampant speculation about his health. Concerns about the seriousness of his condition intensified Wednesday after Venezuelan officials announced the postponement of a high-profile summit of Latin American leaders originally scheduled to take place in Venezuela next month. The government cited Chavez's ""strict process of recovery and medical treatment"" as the reason behind the decision, but provided few details about his health. Over the weekend, several allies of Chavez denied that he had cancer. On Tuesday and Wednesday, VTV broadcast video of Chavez walking and talking with former Cuban leader Fidel Castro in Havana. The video showed Chavez, wearing his trademark track suit, talking with Castro and looking at Tuesday's edition of the state-run Granma newspaper. But while the video showed the pair acting chummy as they talked, neither leader addressed the Venezuelan president's medical condition. The images reaffirmed what Venezuelan officials have been saying, Jaua told state-run VTV Wednesday. Chavez deserves to have the time he needs to recover from surgery, he said.

"(CNN) -- A Colombian drug kingpin who pleaded guilty to smuggling thousands of kilos of cocaine into the United States was sentenced to 22 years in prison, the Justice Department said Thursday. Edgar Vallejo Guarin was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Patricia Seitz Wednesday. Vallejo, 50, was also fined $1 million. A plane worth more than $2 million was also seized, and more than $10 million in drug proceeds in accounts around the world have been forfeited, the department said. In court documents submitted with his guilty plea, Vallejo admitted to running a drug operation that oversaw the shipments of thousands of kilos of cocaine from Colombia to the United States in boats, freighters and airplanes. The drugs arrived in cities like Houston, San Juan and New York, where Vallejo ran criminal groups, in addition to Detroit and Chicago. Vallejo was indicted in 2001, but he remained a fugitive until 2008, when he was captured in Spain. He was extradited to the United States in 2010. The case against him was the result of a joint investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI and Colombian National Police, the Justice Department said.","Edgar Vallejo Guarin was arrested in Spain in 2008 .

"(CNN) -- Billionaire oilman T. Boone Pickens is putting his clout behind renewable energy sources like wind power. T. Boone Pickens talks about the advantages of wind power on CNN in May. The legendary entrepreneur and philanthropist on Tuesday unveiled a new energy plan he says will decrease the United States' dependency on foreign oil by more than one-third and help shift American energy production toward renewable natural resources. ""The Pickens Plan"" calls for investing in domestic renewable resources such as wind, and switching from oil to natural gas as a transportation fuel. In a news conference outlining his proposal, Pickens said his impetus for the plan is the country's dangerous reliance on foreign oil. ""Our dependence on imported oil is killing our economy. It is the single biggest problem facing America today,"" he said.  Watch Pickens discuss plan for wind power Â» . ""Wind power is ... clean, it's renewable.  It's everything you want.  And it's a stable supply of energy,"" Pickens told CNN in May. ""It's unbelievable that we have not done more with wind."" Pickens' company, Mesa Power, recently announced a $2 billion investment as the first step in a multibillion-dollar plan to build the world's largest wind farm in Pampa, Texas. Pickens said Tuesday that if the United States takes advantage of the so-called ""wind corridor,"" stretching from the Canadian border to West Texas, energy from wind turbines built there could supply 20 percent or more of the nation's power. He suggested the project could be funded by private investors. Power from thousands of wind turbines that would line the corridor could be distributed throughout the country via electric power transmission lines and could fuel power plants in large population hubs, the oil baron said. Fueling these plants with wind power would then free up the natural gas historically used to power them, and would mean that natural gas could replace foreign oil as fuel for motor vehicles, he said. Using natural gas for transportation needs could replace one-third of the United States' imported oil and would save more than $230 billion a year, Pickens said. ""We are going to have to do something different in America,"" Pickens told CNN.  ""You can't keep paying out $600 billion a year for oil."" His energy plan could be implemented within 10 years if both Congress and the White House treat the current energy situation as a ""national emergency and take immediate action,"" he predicted. Pickens, a lifelong Republican, says he is not advising either presidential candidate, but is prepared to work with the next president. The Web site for the plan urges people to sign up and help spread the word. Oil analyst Peter Beutel of Cameron Hanover, an energy risk manager, said Pickens' plan could definitely reduce the country's dependency on foreign oil. ""The best thing about it is that it's a definite plan -- it's not something that either party has pitted itself outrightly against. It therefore has a tremendous chance for success on Capitol Hill."" Analyst Fadel Gheit of Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., an investment firm, added that such a plan ""has been on the drawing board for years."" At least 21 states and the District of Columbia have set deadlines or goals for utilities to obtain electricity from clean, renewable sources instead of fossil fuel-burning plants.  See where states stand on renewable resources Â» . The scramble has triggered construction of large-scale wind farms throughout much of the nation, including proposals for the first U.S. offshore facilities. Delaware and Galveston, Texas, have offshore projects in the works, although a farm proposed off New York's Long Island was shelved this year because of high projected construction costs. In Massachusetts, where utilities are under the gun to obtain four percent of electricity from renewables by 2009, builders await federal approval of a hugely controversial wind farm off historic Cape Cod. The Cape Wind project envisions 130 wind turbines each rising 440 feet above Nantucket Sound by 2011. State officials said the farm will eliminate pollution equal to 175,000 gas-burning cars.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Republican Party risks further alienating Hispanic voters if it challenges the nomination of Sonia Sotomayor, who would become the first Hispanic, and the third woman, on the Supreme Court, political analysts say. Judge Sonia Sotomayor would be the first Hispanic U.S. Supreme Court justice if confirmed. On Tuesday, President Obama nominated 54-year-old  Sotomayor -- who is of Puerto Rican descent -- to replace the retiring Justice David Souter. Sotomayor is a judge on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, named to that post by President Bill Clinton when she was a U.S. District Court judge, nominated by President George H.W. Bush in 1992. The barbed comments about Sotomayor began almost as soon as the announcement was made at the White House on Tuesday. Conservative radio personality Rush Limbaugh called Sotomayor a ""reverse racist"" on his show. Limbaugh, who is known for stirring up controversy, said he hopes Obama's nominee fails. ""Do I want her to fail? Yeah. Do I want her to fail to get on the court? Yes. She'd be a disaster on the court,"" he said. ""Do I still want to Obama to fail as president? Yeah. ... He's going to fail anyway, but the sooner the better here so that as little damage can be done to the country."" Limbaugh's attacks aside, many influential Hispanic leaders were optimistic and warned the GOP against rushing to conclusions before she pleads her case before the Senate, which must confirm her. ""I do think Republicans have to be very careful and not oppose this nomination just for the sake of it,"" said Brent Wilkes, executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens. ""Because when you think about that the length of time the Latino community has waited for this nomination, it's been a long time."" ""If they just out of sheer ill-will ... try to block the nomination, that's going to have a big backlash in the Hispanic population,"" Wilkes warned. ""And we won't have to do anything except sit back and watch them destroy themselves, because it's really going to be that bad.""  Watch Sotomayor discuss her nomination Â» . Ruben Navarrette, a syndicated columnist and CNN contributor, said Latinos are simply ""running out of patience."" ""For 20 years I've been hearing the drumbeat from Latinos they been waiting for a Latino on the Supreme Court. ... They're ready and they're due -- not because of what happened in the last election but because what's been going in the past 50 years and what will happen in the next 50,"" he said, referring to the projected rise in the Latino population. According to exit polling from the 2008 general election, Obama received 67 percent of the Hispanic vote and Republican Sen. John McCain received 31 percent -- down significantly from the number of Hispanics who voted for former President George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004. But Republican strategist Leslie Sanchez, who is also a CNN contributor, said senators shouldn't feel obligated to vote for Sotomayor because of the potential for Hispanic outreach, but rather on her qualifications. ""I think many in the Hispanic community are excited about this nomination. There's no doubt about that. As a Latina and as someone who was raised by a single mom I get that,"" she said. ""I think, with all due respect to this confirmation and this process, the fairer we are, the better it is for all people."" Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, a Mexican- American agrees. ""I don't think any gender group or ethnic group is entitled to representation on our courts,"" he said. Alex Castellanos, a GOP strategist and CNN contributor, said Obama may be taking the country back to the era of identity politics. ""He didn't play that card in the campaign, he fought against that. And he said we're now at a new place,"" he said. ""And now the question is ... is he taking us back to identity politics saying that someone is a better judge because of their race or their gender or their ethnicity? Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN contributor, however says it's extremely likely that Sotomayor will be confirmed based on her qualifications and not her ethnicity. ""Not only does she have the compelling personal story, she has the highest qualifications that you can imagine. ... So she has the qualifications of a Chief Justice [John] Roberts, whose life story is about as interesting as a mayonaise sandwich on white bread ... and she has this compelling personal story."" When asked about the risk of alienating Hispanic voters, Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said, ""You have to be careful, you don't want to be seen as a bully in this situation.""  Watch more on the potential battle brewing Â» . ""I think our party will right now avoid the partisan knee-jerks that come with some of these things,"" he added. ""We're not in the business of pillorying someone ... we do have some reservations and concerns on her views on the Second Amendment, her views on abortion, her views on ... property rights."" Potential 2012 presidential candidate Mike Huckabee -- who mistakenly referred to her as ""Maria"" in a press release -- said the pick is the ""clearest indication yet that President Obama's campaign promises to be a centrist and think in a bipartisan way were mere rhetoric."" ""If she is confirmed, then we need to take the blindfold off Lady Justice,"" he added. Another potential 2012 GOP candidate, Mitt Romney, also weighed in, calling her nomination ""troubling."" ""Her public statements make it clear she has an expansive view of the role of the judiciary. Historically, the court is where judges interpret the Constitution and apply the law. ... What the American public deserves is a judge who will put the law above her own personal political philosophy.""","President Obama nominates Judge Sonia Sotomayor to Supreme Court .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Finding one of the newest hot spots for dining in Los Angeles may require Twittering and a GPS, because the locations of the Kogi trucks are always changing. A hungry crowd gathers one night around a Kogi truck in Los Angeles. ""We were like the first ones here, and we didn't know. It's gotta be somewhere around here, so we went around for a good 20 minutes trying to find the place. But we heard the tacos were insanely good,"" said Robert Rabis, who was dining with his wife, Tiffany Tang. Those mouth-watering tacos are a fusion of Korean and Mexican food and are served from two company trucks that have drawn a devoted following over six months. Word from those satisfied mouths and the social network Twitter has people lining up at the trucks for up to two hours. First-time Kogi customer Rabis said it was worth the wait.  Watch how even celebs love the food Â» . ""Plus all of my co-workers are going to know about it. They want to know the new 'in' thing. The whole hospital staff is going to know by tomorrow when I get to work, and they'll be sure to go on the Internet trying to find the next location,"" he said. Two Kogi trucks, named Verde and Roja, roam the streets of the Los Angeles area from noon until about 2 a.m. Kogi co-founder Caroline Shin-Manguera sometimes has a hard time wrapping her head around their success. ""It doesn't make any sense whatsoever. We make our people wait in line for two hours, and we make them wait in the rain, and we don't give them chairs to sit on, we don't take reservations, we're late half the time, but we must be doing something right."" It may be the fresh gourmet food at low prices during a recession. Katherine Clouet, a 20-something who drove 30 minutes in Los Angeles traffic and waited about an hour in line, likes the prices. ""You go to a restaurant, you're going to spend at least 20 bucks. It's only $2 for tacos. I mean so that's great."" Kogi frontman Mark Manguera, who has worked in some of L.A.'s most prestigious restaurants, came up with the idea for Kogi while hungry after a late night out. A small group friends pitched in to make this small business a booming success. The trucks offer customers reasonably priced fare: tacos for $2, and burritos, sliders and kimchi quesadillas for $5. One of Manguera's friends, chef Roy Choi, creates the recipes; another friend, Eddie Gonzales, manages the operation; and his sister-in-law, Alice Shin, handles the tweets from across the country in New York. Choi trained at the Culinary Institute of America and cooked at places like Le Bernardin in New York and Trader Vics in Los Angeles before jumping into the taco truck business. His recipe for success is mixing great ingredients with his passion for good food. ""So if it starts with that love and that passion, it's got to be great no matter what it is. Now you pair that with great natural beef, short ribs, all-natural pork, all-natural chicken, pure sesame, pure sesame oil, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, scallions. Everything made fresh every day, marinating overnight."" The company launched in November 2008 with one truck and basically had no customers, so the owners ate the tacos themselves. Today, they have more than 25,500 followers on Twitter, and they can't even estimate how many people they feed a day. Choi says the goal is to ""serve the best possible food for the cheapest price, and just try to get rid of everything you have, and you made everything fresh that day."" Dining from the trucks late at night can be a community or family affair. ""There's sometimes 600-1,000 people in the street. Sometimes they wait for us even before we get there. Sometimes late at night, even midnight, they bring their 2-year-old, 3-year-old, 4-year-old kids and they wait in line,"" notes Choi. Clouet was pleased with her first Kogi experience and says it's ""something to do. Ya know, to spend an hour of your life in line and mingle with people. You've never seen these people before, but they're here for the same reason."" Locations can change at the last minute, so diners better have a phone or BlackBerry with them so they're not standing in some parking lot by themselves waiting for nothing. Some parking lot owners welcome Kogi, and others do not, but the chef simply takes it all in stride. ""I look at our food as graffiti, ya know, so like some people look at graffiti as a beautiful thing, some people think that it's a menace to society, ya know. I think it's the same thing with Kogi. Some people embrace us, enjoy our food, invite us into their places and their parking lots; some people look at us as a menace."" One song was commissioned by a customer who is wild about Kogi. The Kogi folks have high hopes of expanding, but they want to do it carefully. They rent the two original trucks from a friend, and in a few weeks, two more trucks will be in circulation in Southern California. Shin-Manguera, who handles the finances, says, ""We're looking actively to do a location in New York as kind of one of our goals at the moment. We got a huge response from New York and the New York market wanting us to be out there. Hopefully, a couple of the other major cities. And in the far future, possibly internationally to certain different countries.""","Rain or shine, Kogi fans wait in line to dine in parking lots at night .

"(CNN) -- Joran van der Sloot is willing to confess to a ""simple homicide"" charge in relation to the May 2010 death of a woman in Peru, but not to more serious charges that would carry longer prison terms, his lawyer said Monday. Meanwhile, the victim's family asked a three-judge panel for a more stringent charge that could have the 24-year-old Dutch national's indictment sent back to the prosecutor's office -- a move that could prompt a delay in his trial, if the court assents -- the Lima, Peru, Superior Court said Monday. Both the accused and the victim's family disagree with the indictment proposed by prosecutor Miriam Riveros Castellares. She is asking the panel to indict Van der Sloot on charges of qualified murder and simple robbery, which carry 28-year and 2-year sentences. He would also make a restitution payment of $73,000 to the victim's family. Attorney Luis Jiminez Navarro and his client, Van der Sloot, did not attend the hearing due to what Navarro described as the massive media interest in the case. But the lawyer did submit his response to a proposed indictment in writing, asking for a simple homicide charge that could carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. He said, too, that his client would confess to this charge. But the attorney for the family of the victim, Stephany Flores, told the three judges that the prosecutor's proposed indictment against Van der Sloot had ""mistakes,"" a news release from the court said. It did not specify what mistakes Edward Alvarez Yrala referred to in his arguments. According to Navarro, Yrala asked the court to charge Van der Sloot with a charge akin to aggravated murder, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The panel has 15 days to decide on Yrala's request for a new indictment. If a decision is made not to return the indictment to the prosecutor's office, a date will be set for Van der Sloot to stand trial on murder and theft charges, the court said. Flores was found dead in Van der Sloot's hotel room in Lima last year. Police say Van der Sloot took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested a few days later. Three Peruvian drivers who allegedly helped Van der Sloot flee to Chile are also charged in the case. Prosecutors want five-year prison sentences for them and fines of about $1,800. Van der Sloot was once the prime suspect in the disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway, who vanished while on a graduation trip to the Caribbean island of Aruba. He was arrested twice but never charged in connection with Holloway's disappearance, which remains unsolved. Before he resigned earlier this year as Van der Sloot's lawyer in the Peruvian case, Maximo Altez told In Session his client attacked Flores after she found something on his computer that tied him to Holloway. He gave In Session a copy of a motion he filed asking that Van der Sloot face a lesser charge for a crime of passion. ""My client ... admits having murdered the victim, but not with ferocity, for profit or pleasure, nor any of the other element(s) that make up this murder, but only by violent emotion that overtook him at the time he was attacked by the victim,"" the motion read. Van der Sloot was arrested in June of last year in relation to Flores' death, but was not formally charged until this month. Earlier this month, Flores' family urged prosecutors to file charges, warning that Van der Sloot could be released by December unless the case goes ahead. Under Peruvian law, if a suspect's trial doesn't begin within 18 months of his arrest, he is set free. In Session's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","NEW: Van der Sloot's lawyer wants a charge that could have a 20-year maximum term .

"(CNN) -- The World Health Organization celebrated its birthday Saturday by focusing on aging, including a host of events, research and information under the theme, ""Good health adds life to years."" Leaders and nonprofit organizations took to Twitter to mark World Health Day and toast the WHO, whose constitution was enacted April 7, 1948, to affirm its mission as the ""directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system."" These groups included the Kenyan Red Cross, Grand Challenges Canada, the Cleveland Clinic and the International Diabetes Federation, among others. The U.N. itself also chimed in, with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urging civic and private leaders to devote ""attention and resources to ensuring that people everywhere have the chance to grow older in good health."" That includes realizing the many ways older people contribute to society, as well as knowing what it will take to take care of them as they age. By 2050, the WHO estimates that there will be almost 400 million people age 80 and older -- compared to about 14 million people in that age group around 1950. ""Older people make many valuable contributions to society -- as family members, as active participants in the workforce and as volunteers within communities. The wisdom they have gained throughout their lives makes them a unique resource for society,"" Ban said in a press release. ""But more older people also means an increased demand on health care and social security systems."" The WHO itself marked World Health Day with festivities at its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. The organization's campaign aims, in part, to challenge stereotypes about older people -- like that they can't take care of themselves, can't work or play as well as others, and are no longer attractive. The WHO said it is important that older people are engaged in their societies and in their health, and that citizens and governments are similarly committed. Having sound preparations and actions to address the aging population is not only a moral imperative, but also one that makes sense economically and politically, according to the agency. ""If we can ensure that people are living healthier as well as longer lives, the opportunities will be greater and the costs to society less,"" WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said in the foreword of the ""Global Brief for World Health Day 2012."" ""This great demographic challenge of the first half of the 21st century therefore demands a public health response, and WHO has identified this as a priority.""","World Health Day is Saturday, the World Health Organization's birthday .

"(CNN) -- A British adventurer rescued after a failed attempt to sail solo around the globe says she is relieved to be back on land. Sara Outen tweeted a photo of herself late Saturday from a Japanese hospital where she is undergoing evaluation after the nation's coast guard rescued her when her boat became disabled. ""Relieved to be back on land and with friends,"" Outen tweeted. Outen began her solo circumnavigation April 1, 2011, in London with plans to cycle, row and kayak more than 20,000 miles. She hoped to finish in London in autumn 2013. She was traveling alone when her boat was damaged during a tropical storm, rolling several times. A nearby merchant vessel and a coast guard plane kept watch on her until the rescue ship arrived. Outen kept followers apprised of her ordeal in real time, tweeting from sea: ""Focusing on calm trying2 block out wind and waves. Visualizing family and friends pulling us in."" More from Mainsail: The sailing world's hardest race . She was rescued Friday, though rough waters made it impossible for the Japan coast guard to tow her boat Gulliver back to port. ""As expected, due to adverse sea conditions, it was not possible to tow Gulliver back to land.,"" Outen's support team, London2London, said in a blog post Saturday. The team was ""looking at options regarding Gulliver."" Outen was halfway to her goal when her boat was damaged. Her team says she has cycled and kayaked more than 11,000 miles, going through countries including Germany, Poland, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and China. Meanwhile, a second solo British rower who was stranded about 280 miles northeast of where Outen was found has been rescued, according to his website. Charlie Martell was attempting to row 6,000 miles across the Pacific when his boat was disabled by the same tropical storm that damaged Outen's Gulliver. He was rescued late Friday by a Russian crew, his website said. ""Charlie spoke briefly to his support team to confirm that he is in good shape and uninjured, following a 36-hour wait since issuing the mayday signal,"" according to a posting on his website.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- As a product designer, Agustin Otegui's has to ""think big"" about the objects he creates. From novel portable chairs made out of shovels to chrome radiators that look like modern works of art, he recasts the mundane in a modernist and functional new light. The Nano Vent Skin forms an organic skin around a building providing its energy needs. Yet when he got thinking about how he could help with solutions to mitigate climate change he started thinking small. Very small, in fact. His futuristic concept is called the Nano Vent-Skin (NVS) and the design -- to wrap buildings in an organic lattice skin made up of micro wind turbines -- is radical. It's an intriguing idea and an exciting confluence of cutting edge science and industrial design. Back in 1959 American physicist Richard Feynman famously predicted that we'd be creating atom sized machines in the future. Today, advances in nanotechnology -- the science of impossibly small materials -- are rapid. Scientific discoveries at nanoscale -- one billionth of a meter -- are finding their way out of the lab and into production, creating more efficient computer chips and coatings for glass. It was all the big ""green"" projects around the world that got Otegui thinking about smaller solutions. Otegui told CNN: ""Instead of trying to build these huge turbines which are always getting bigger and bigger, I thought, why not do something on a small scale and use it on existing objects and buildings. I wanted to try to cover them like a crawling plants you see on facades."" Armed with the desire to create something 100 percent organic, Otegui set about researching the possibilities. ""I found out about nanotubes and then I came across some MIT research into nano-manufacturing,"" he explained. Otegui imagines (see photos) merging living organisms to form a complex skin which will absorb and then utilize the energy created by the sun and wind. Solar power is harvested through an organic photovoltaic skin which then transfers the energy to nano-fibres located inside nano-wires. The power is then sent to storage units located at the end of each panel. In addition the turbine blades -- which Otegui envisages to be 25 millimeters in length and 10 millimeters wide -- absorb CO2. He says that on rough calculations each turbine would produce 0.2 watts of energy and a square meter grid of turbines could produce around 90 watts of power. Designs incorporating nanotechnology are a far cry from Otegui's day job which has seen him employed in the design departments of car industry giants like BMW, Citroen and Fiat -- working on the grill and wing mirrors of the new 500 (Cinquecento) -- in recent years. His spare time is taken up by designing anything from external storage units -- ""the urban shell"" -- to multi-use stools and sandals. His dedication has already been rewarded in the shape of awards and exhibitions in London, Barcelona and Milan. The NVS looks set to go the same way with interested parties already contacting Otegui to find out more. There are some controversial branches of nanoscience but Otegui is keen to stress that his take on nanotechnology isn't. ""These micro organisms will not been genetically altered,"" he said. ""They will work as a trained colony where each member has a specific task in the symbiotic process."" He says he's not trying to reinvent or reshape the future. ""It's just acting as a merger of different means and approaches into energy absorption and transformation, which will never happen in nature,"" he said. Otegui concedes that implementation of nano-manufacturing of this type is still years away. ""Even in 10 or 15 years it wont be accessible to everyone, but people will hopefully be developing materials,"" he said. Nevertherless, the NVS offers up a glimpse of the future, where energy might just be greener than anyone could have possibly imagined.","Mexican born product designer creates a radical concept for tackling climate change .

"(CNN) -- Android users beware. Download the wrong version of your favorite pig-killing game and the birds won't be the only ones who are angry. ""Angry Birds: Space,"" the latest installment of the insanely popular mobile game, is being used to mask some fairly nasty malware, according to security experts and Rovio, the maker of ""Angry Birds."" Graham Cluley, an analyst with Web security firm Sophos, wrote on the company's blog Thursday that they had discovered fake versions of the game on unofficial app stores. The fake games contain a ""Trojan horse"" virus. A post on Rovio's blog on Thursday also warned fans to watch out for fake versions of the game, urging them to download the new title from their official store. According to Sophos, the Trojan horse, which it identified in a file called Andr/KongFu-L, appears to be a fully functional version of the game, but instead installs a virus on the user's smartphone or tablet. From there, the code tries to install more malware that essentially puts the phone or tablet computer under the control of the cybercriminals behind it, Cluley wrote. ""It feels like we have to keep reminding Android users to be on their guard against malware risks, and to be very careful, especially when downloading applications from unofficial Android markets,"" he said. Unlike Apple, which screens all its apps and requires iPhone and iPad owners to download software from its official App Store, Google maintains less control over what people can install on devices that run its Android operating system. The company allows Android owners to download programs from official and unofficial sources. Security experts say Android device owners should use the official Android Market if they want to avoid downloading fake apps and potentially harmful programs, although there have been instances of malicious software showing up in that official venue, too. From Harry Potter to Ana Kournikova, it's not unusual for malicious hackers to use popular topics, often from the entertainment and celebrity world, to lure potential victims. ""Angry Birds: Space"" was released March 22 for the iPhone, iPad and Android devices, as well as Macs and PCs. It soared to a mind-blowing 10 million downloads in just three days, three times faster than the franchise's last outing, ""Angry Birds: Rio."" Released in 2009, ""Angry Birds"" is the No.1 paid mobile app of all time, crossing 300 million downloads, across multiple platforms, last year. Based in Finland, Rovio parlayed the game's success into a virtual empire, offering everything from comic books and animated videos to plush dolls and cookbooks based on the game.","Fake ""Angry Birds: Space"" versions may contain dangerous malware .

"(CNN) -- Looking at the world's most beautiful women, from actresses to musicians to models, AskMen.com wanted its users to consider one thing above all else: Would you date them? AskMen released its list of the ""Top 99 Most Desirable Women of 2012"" Tuesday, based on the results of polling both readers and office staff. While Editor-in-Chief James Bassil agrees that it's not as easy to qualify a woman you've only seen on TV as a potential girlfriend, the list isn't just made up of gorgeous models. ""Looks are obviously a big one for guys -- there's no question about that -- but other factors are where a woman is in life, the kind of career she's in and the success or ambition that reflects. Sincerity and loyalty, all of those values that guys appreciate. We ask them to try to really assess the candidates as prospective girlfriends and rank them according to that. That's what really distinguishes the list from a straight-up 'hot women list.' "" ""Modern Family's"" Sofia Vergara nabbed the top honors and, at age 39, is the ""most senior No. 1 we've had,"" Bassil said. ""Seeing her in the show's family context contributes to that desirability perception and those very criteria that we ask users to judge them by,"" he said. ""There's no question that she's hot. She does lots of interviews where she's funny and charming and seems easygoing -- all of those personal characteristics that guys prize in women. It seems like there is a sincerity there too, and that's a huge thing for guys in relationships."" While models have their fair share of representation on the list, a few surprises also sneaked into the top numbers. Kate Upton, Rooney Mara, Miranda Kerr, Nicki Minaj, Emma Stone, Scarlett Johansson, Kim Kardashian, Rihanna and Candice Swanepoel made up the rest of the top 10. While Victoria's Secret models are enjoying more visibility these days because of increased TV specials, Bassil doesn't believe they're at the same level of supermodels from the '80s and '90s, like Cindy Crawford and Claudia Schiffer. Noticeably absent were Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Aniston. Bassil believes men are ""fatigued"" by the two actresses. Jolie's private, reserved life makes her too much of a mystery without allowing insight into her personality, while Aniston has never performed well on the list, Bassil said. Newcomers like Lana Del Rey, Emilia Clarke, Adele, Kreayshawn, and Paz de la Huerta edged standbys from past years aside. Kristen Wiig outranked Tina Fey at No. 36, while Fey dropped to No. 97. Former child stars are also being perceived as the mature young women they've grown into, like Selena Gomez and Emma Watson, ranked respectively at Nos. 14 and 17. Kate Middleton, making the list at No. 11, beat her sister, Pippa, by a long shot. The younger sibling barely made the list at No. 98, but Bassil believes that may be a reflection of the new voting system. The voting, which began in October, lasted just over six weeks, with an initial pool of 170 candidates. Users ranked their top 10 on a personal list, and each woman received points for being added to a list, as well as her ranking on the list. The results created one list of 99 candidates. AskMen's staff also conducted an internal vote, and the two lists combined represent the final product.","Sofia Vergara tops AskMen.com's 2012 list of most desirable women .

"(CNN) -- Police in Bahrain regularly resort to beating anti-government protesters, despite officials' pledges to stop such practices, a human rights group said Sunday. A Bahraini government spokesman denied that allegation and others made in the Human Rights Watch report. ""The allegations are absurd, and unfortunately, we ask for human rights organizations not to rely on unreliable sources,"" said government spokesman Abdul-Aziz bin Mubarak Al Khalifa. Human Rights Watch said interviews revealed at least five instances in the past month in which police severely beat detainees -- some of whom were minors, according to a report issued after representatives from the group finished a five-day visit to the island nation. Visible injury marks appeared to confirm details of accounts from former detainees interviewed by Human Rights Watch, the organization said. Treatment of prisoners inside police stations and formal detention facilities has improved, Human Rights Watch said, and Bahrain appears to have made ""rapid progress"" in eliminating torture inside police stations after a committee last year recommended installing video cameras there. But now, according to Human Rights Watch, beating and torture of prisoners is continuing at informal facilities and in secluded outdoor areas, where detainees have been taken for up to two hours before they're transferred to police stations. ""Bahrain's leaders need to make clear that they will investigate and punish those responsible for abuses when the cameras are off,"" Human Rights Watch said. The Bahraini government spokesman said Human Rights Watch's relationship with political activists ""is such that they don't check the legitimacy or facts behind the allegations."" CNN has not independently confirmed the rights group's report. Al Khalifa said the government has taken steps to implement recommendations made by an independent commission last year. Dozens of officers are currently being investigated under a new government system to look into torture allegations, he said. Sunday's Human Rights Watch report comes amid growing global scrutiny of the human rights situation in the Gulf state. Earlier this month opposition groups in Bahrain and politicians around the world called for officials to cancel a Formula 1 race as violent clashes continued between activists and authorities. The Bahrain Grand Prix continued as scheduled, but protesters used the international spotlight on the race to call for the release of Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, a detained human rights activist who has been on a hunger strike for more than two months. The activist, who was arrested last April for his role in anti-government demonstrations that swept through his country, is protesting his life prison sentence. Last June, al-Khawaja and seven other Shiite opposition activists were found guilty of plotting to overthrow the country's Sunni royal family. On Sunday, Bahrain's information ministry denied that it was force-feeding al-Khawaja, saying in statement that al-Khawaja gave consent for doctors to insert a naso-gastric tube for nutrition after his blood sugar dropped. Demonstrations in Bahrain failed to gain the traction of other Arab Spring uprisings after a crackdown by authorities in the island state, backed by troops from nearby Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In November of last year, Bahrain's Independent Commission of Inquiry issued a report critical of authorities' reactions to the protests, which began in February 2011, spurred by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. The independent commission, set up by Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, found that between February and April of last year, 35 people were killed in unrest there. Two senior international advisers to Bahrain's chief of public security told Human Rights Watch they had visited some of the informal facilities identified by the group, but found no evidence of detainees being taken there and mistreated. The chief said the government planned to improve police training to stop abuse, according to Human Rights Watch. Earlier this month, the state-run Bahrain News Agency published a statement responding to another report by Human Rights Watch that alleged Bahrain had not lived up to its commitments on reform. The nation's Ministry of Human Rights and Social Development dismissed the criticism as rash, saying that Human Rights Watch report ""had ignored the positive developments in the country and the continuation of the reform process,"" and that it was committed to the protection of human rights. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph, Mohammed Jamjoom and Peter Wilkinson contributed to this report.","NEW: ""The allegations are absurd,"" a Bahraini government spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Champion cyclist Lance Armstrong refiled a lawsuit Tuesday against the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency in a bid to halt a doping case against him. One day earlier, a federal judge threw out Armstrong's original suit, blasting the seven-time Tour de France champion in a sharply worded ruling. In his brief order, U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks wrote that the case was full of legally irrelevant claims ""included solely to increase media coverage of this case"" and stir up hostility toward USADA. He urged the cyclist to refile his lawsuit without ""any improper argument, rhetoric, or irrelevant material."" Like the original, the refiled suit asks the court to file an injunction against USADA by Saturday, the agency's deadline for Armstrong to agree to contest the charges or accept sanctions. It is substantially shorter than the original lawsuit, by about 55 pages. USADA has accused Armstrong of using performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong maintains he has never tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs and has said USADA and its CEO, Travis Tygart, are out to get a ""big fish"" to justify the agency's existence. ""Throughout his 20-plus year professional career, Mr. Armstrong has been subjected to 500 to 600 drug tests without a single positive test,"" the refiled suit reads. It contends USADA ""does not have the right to force him to arbitrate those charges without a valid, enforceable legal agreement to do so."" The 40-year-old Armstrong faces a lifetime ban and could be stripped of his Tour de France victories if found guilty by USADA. Armstrong won the tour each year from 1999 to 2005, most of those for a team sponsored by the U.S. Postal Service. He retired twice from cycling -- first in 2005, for four years, and again in 2011. USADA is a quasi-government agency recognized as the official anti-doping agency for Olympic, Pan American and Paralympic events in the United States. In a June letter to Armstrong, a copy of which was obtained by CNN, the agency said it collected blood samples from Armstrong in 2009 and 2010 that were ""fully consistent with blood manipulation including EPO use and/or blood transfusions."" EPO, or erythropoietin, boosts the number of red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the muscles. Armstrong has been dogged by allegations of drug abuse in recent years, with compatriot Floyd Landis -- who was found guilty of doping in the 2006 Tour de France, resulting in him being stripped of the title -- making a series of claims last year. Armstrong came out fighting in May 2011, in the face of fresh allegations made on CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" show by another American, Tyler Hamilton. In the CBS interview, Hamilton, who retired in 2009 after twice testing positive himself, says he first saw Armstrong use EPO in 1999. ""I saw it in his refrigerator,"" Hamilton told the news program. ""I saw him inject it more than one time like we all did, like I did many, many times."" In February, Justice Department prosecutors said they closed a criminal investigation after reviewing allegations against Armstrong. They had called witnesses to a federal grand jury in Los Angeles, but they apparently determined they lacked evidence to bring a charge that Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong has won two half-distance Ironman events this year, and he is suspended from World Triathlon Corporation competitions. The world championships will be held in October in Hawaii. He was a U.S. triathlon champion as a teenager.","NEW: Cycling champ Armstrong asks the court to file an injunction against USADA .

"London (CNN) -- One of England's biggest soccer stars went on trial Monday, accused of hurling racist abuse at another player during a match last year. The normally staid chambers of Westminster Magistrates' Court in London got an earful of shockingly foul language as lawyers and witnesses detailed what Chelsea captain John Terry said to Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand in the match. A lip reader watching a video of the incident told the court what Terry said, including two extremely obscene words. Terry did not deny directing a barrage of foul language at Ferdinand and referring to him as ""black,"" but he denied engaging in racist abuse. The highly unusual criminal prosecution over words uttered on a soccer field comes as English soccer officials fight to stamp racism out of the sport, with mixed results. Liverpool player Luis Suarez was banned for eight matches when the Football Association, the English sport's governing body, found he had racially abused Manchester United defender Patrice Evra. The chanting of racist abuse by fans also remains a sporadic problem in soccer across Europe. The Crown Prosecution Service is pressing charges against Terry for a ""racially aggravated public order offense"" because of the comments during an October 23 match between Chelsea and Queens Park Rangers. Prosecutors played a video of the incident, without sound, as the case opened Monday morning. The alleged abuse came after Ferdinand knocked Terry down during the game, the jury heard. When he got up, Terry made a gesture as if Ferdinand's breath smelled, and he called Ferdinand a ""c---,"" prosecutor Duncan Penny told the court. Ferdinand responded with the same word, saying it described Terry, not him, because Terry had had sex with a teammate's wife, the prosecutor said. Ferdinand also made an obscene gesture related to sex as Terry ran back into position, Penny said. Ferdinand testified that he did not hear the comments Terry made at him, but that he would have been ""hurt and disappointed"" if he had heard Terry call him a ""black c---"" ""When someone brings your color into it, it takes it to another level and it's very hurtful,"" Ferdinand said. Terry maintains that Ferdinand knocked him down before the incident and that the two then exchanged ""normal football verbals."" He told Football Association officials that he then repeated to Ferdinand words he thought the opposing player had said to him, Penny told the court Monday. The maximum penalty for the offense is ÃÂ£2,500 (about $3,900). That would be a drop in the bucket for a player worth millions, but a criminal conviction could lead to action against him by his team or England's Football Association. Terry was captain of England's national team at the time of the incident but was stripped of his captaincy after a preliminary court hearing on the racism charge in February. He remained captain of Chelsea, which went on to win the prestigious Europe-wide Champions League this year. The trial could last up to five days, court officials say.","NEW: A lip reader tells the court what John Terry said, including two extremely obscene words .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- At least 140 Afghan schoolgirls and female teachers were admitted to a local hospital Tuesday after drinking poisoned water, said local health officials, who blamed the act on extremists opposed to women's education. The victims range in age from 14 to 30 and were taken to a hospital in Afghanistan's northeastern Takhar province after their school's water tank was contaminated, according to provincial health department director Dr. Hafizullah Safi. No deaths were reported, but more than half the victims partially lost consciousness, while others suffered dizziness and vomiting. ""Looking at the health condition of these girls, I can definitely say that their water was contaminated by some sort of poison,"" Safi said. ""But we don't know yet what was the water exactly contaminated with."" Taliban say they trained attackers . Local officials said they are investigating the incident at the Rostaq district school and are searching for the perpetrators. ""It is the work of those who are against girls' education and peace and stability in Afghanistan,"" district administrator Malem Hussain said. In 2010, more than 100 schoolgirls and teachers were sickened in a series of similar poisonings. During the Taliban's rule from 1996 to 2001, many Afghan girls were not allowed to attend school, though the schools began reopening after the regime was toppled by the U.S.-led invasion. Observers say, however, that abuse of women remains common in the post-Taliban era and is often accepted in conservative and traditional families, where women are barred from education and commonly subjected to domestic violence.

In January 2011, Afghan Education Minister Dr. Farooq Wardak told the Education World Forum in London that the Taliban had abandoned their opposition to girls' education. But the group never offered a statement confirming or denying that claim.

"Washington (CNN) -- Capitol Hill lawmakers made a fresh push Tuesday to gain passage of a law that punishes those who lie about earning high military honors. The Supreme Court ruled June 28 that the Stolen Valor Act of 2006 was unconstitutional, saying it violated the free speech rights of those making false claims about winning the Medal of Honor and other combat citations. A revised, more narrow version would make it a federal misdemeanor for anyone to benefit financially from lying about military service, records or awards. That would include receiving federal veterans and health care benefits, government contracts or jobs reserved for veterans. Similar state and federal fraud statutes are already on the books, but this law codifies sanctions for those seeking to profit strictly from false military service. ""We must defend the valor of those who have served our country, especially those men and women who have earned awards for outstanding service, but that we also must protect the very liberties for which our service men and women sacrificed,"" said Rep. Joe Heck, R-Nevada. ""The Stolen Valor Act of 2011 would achieve both objectives."" Heck, who is also a colonel in the U.S. Army Reserves, and co-sponsor Sen. Scott Brown, R-Massachusetts, held a news conference on the Hill with supporters of the bill, including Mark Donald, a retired Navy SEAL and 2008 Navy Cross recipient. ""It's not about really a person. The awards represent character, they represent the character of the individual,"" said Donald. ""They represent character of the unit, character of the service, character of the country. Those awards actually don't belong to me, they belong to all of us. It's a trademark of the country is what it is, for what happened that day."" At issue before the high court last month was the constitutional value of false statements of fact, and whether Congress went too far when passing the Stolen Valor Act in 2006. A former California politician was prosecuted by the Justice Department for publicly stating he had earned the Medal of Honor, when in fact the man, Xavier Alvarez, had never served in the military. That conviction -- and the law itself -- were dismissed. Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy said the law violated free speech protections. ""The nation well knows that one of the costs of the First Amendment is that it protects the speech we detest as well as the speech we embrace,"" he said. ""Though few might find (Alvarez's) statements anything but contemptible, his right to make those statements is protected by the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of speech and expression. The Stolen Valor Act infringes upon speech protected by the First Amendment."" The high court has traditionally been skeptical of legislation attempting to limit or regulate ""unpopular"" speech or free expression -- such as burning the flag, picketing military funerals and the marketing of animal cruelty videos. But Brown said the revised legislation would ""punish military liars and cheats in a way that satisfies the court's concerns."" The freshman senator currently seeking re-election is also a 33-year member of the U.S. Army National Guard, a colonel in the Judge Advocate General's Corps. The original Stolen Valor Act was designed to ""protect the reputation"" of military decorations, citing ""fraudulent claims surrounding the receipt of the Medal of Honor (and other congressionally authorized military medals, decorations, and honors)."" Similar laws have been in place since 1948. Spearheading both laws were Pam and Douglas Sterner, former Colorado natives who helped draft the legislation and who lobbied members of Congress to pass it. The couple attended the event Tuesday on Capitol Hill. The Sterners hope technology will soon eliminate many of the military medal frauds. They have been lobbying to secure a government-funded national database of all medal citations, making it easy for the public -- employers, voters, family and almost anyone -- to check to see who has received what. Privacy concerns have blocked previous efforts. At a Pentagon briefing on Tuesday, George Little, a spokesman for Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, said since the Supreme Court decision, the Pentagon had initiated a review of setting up such a database. ""We are exploring options to stand up a database of valor awards and medals, we haven't arrived at a final conclusion yet, but that process is ongoing and the goal is to stand up such a database,"" Little said. The Pentagon review is examining not just a database of recipients of the Medal of Honor, which Little says the Pentagon already has strong informational control over, but also many of the other medals of valor, such as the Silver and Bronze Stars and the Navy Cross. Completing a database with so many awards and matching them to names of recipients going back as early as the Vietnam or Korean wars would pose an organizational challenge, something Little said would have to be addressed in the review. ""There are some complexities involved in looking back into history, we would obviously hope to be able to go as far back as possible, but we also want there to be integrity in the data,"" Little said. One other complexity the Pentagon will have to examine is how to get around releasing names and operations of troops wounded on classified missions. ""Those are the kinds of things that we know we're going to have to look at,"" said Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. John Kirby. CNN's Juanisha Brooks and Mike Mount contributed to this report.","The Stolen Valor Act of 2006 was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court .

"(CNN) -- The man accused of plotting to use model airplanes loaded with explosives to attack the Pentagon and U.S. Capitol agreed Tuesday to a plea deal. Rezwan Ferdaus, a 26-year-old from Ashland, Massachusetts, will plead guilty to two of the six charges against him and faces 17 years in prison followed by 10 years of supervised release, according to a statement from the Justice Department. Ferdaus, a U.S. citizen, will plead guilty to attempting to damage and destroy a federal building by means of an explosive and attempting to provide material support and resources to al Qaeda for attacks on U.S. troops overseas, authorities said. A change-of-plea hearing was scheduled for July 20 in Boston. Ferdaus planned to use large remote-controlled model aircraft filled with C-4 plastic explosive against the targets, officials said. He was arrested in September as a result of an undercover FBI investigation. A law enforcement official said in October that Ferdaus posed no immediate danger to the public because undercover operatives kept in close contact with him. There is no information suggesting that he was connected to a foreign terrorist organization, the source said, adding that he was apparently radicalized by watching videos on the Internet. The investigation also involved a cooperating witness, and authorities began recording conversations between that witness and Ferdaus in January 2011, officials said. Ferdaus began planning a violent ""jihad"" against America in early 2010, according to the federal indictment against him, and he began supplying the FBI undercover agents with cell phones rigged to act as electric switches for improved explosive devices, intended to be used to kill U.S. soldiers overseas. Undercover federal agents gave Ferdaus, who has a physics degree from Northeastern University in Boston, 25 pounds of fake C-4 explosives. Only a very small amount of it was real, the source said. FBI agents also gave Ferdaus six AK-47 assault rifles and three grenades, but they weren't functional, the source said. Between May and September, Ferdaus also ordered and acquired a $6,500 remote-controlled aircraft, an F-86 Sabre, that he kept under a false name in a rented storage facility in Framingham, Massachusetts, the indictment said. He also planned to use other remote-controlled models of military aircraft, the indictment said. The models he planned to use are about one-10th the size of the actual aircraft.

"(CNN) -- The death last month of a 53-year-old former investment banker who collapsed in an Arizona courtroom, minutes after a jury found him guilty of torching his palatial Phoenix estate, appears to have been a suicide, police said Tuesday. Michael Marin was facing a sentence of seven to 21 years in prison on June 28 when courtroom video shows that he appeared to put something into his mouth and swallowed. Minutes later, he appeared to put something else into his mouth, and again swallowed. Shortly afterward, he went into convulsions and was taken to Maricopa County Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. Late Monday or early Tuesday, Marin's adult son received a delayed e-mail from his father ""telling him that if things don't go good in court, Marin's wills are in place and his car can be found at a Mesa location,"" Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio told reporters. The family relayed that information to police, who searched the car's cargo area and found a canister labeled sodium cyanide, he said. Investigators determined that Marin had ordered the quick-acting poison -- typically used in agriculture and gold mining -- from a California-based company and that it was delivered by FedEx to his home in 2011. ""All indications point to suicide but, until the final report, this case still remains open,"" he said. Statutory rape case dismissed after alleged victim commits suicide . The coroner will determine the cause of death. ""We assume that Marin made capsules out of this toxic substance before coming to court on June 28,"" he said. The product, which typically sells for $68 for 200 grams, was on sale this week for half off, Arpaio said. He described the family as ""very distraught,"" but cooperating with investigators. During his career working for Wall Street investment banks, the Yale University Law School graduate had collected Picasso artwork, driven a Rolls Royce and flew his own plane. ""He was en engaging character,"" said Paul Rubin, who profiled Marin in 2008 for the Phoenix New Times newspaper. ""He's the smartest guy in the room, the smoothest talker in the room,"" Rubin told CNN. ""He gets all the girls, he's that guy. And he hit a brick wall."" Marin's brick wall proved to be his 10,000 square-foot home in the Biltmore Estates, an exclusive enclave in Phoenix. Marin bought the house in 2008, as the real estate market was collapsing, with an interest-only mortgage payment of $17,250 per month. But Marin had long before been fired from Wall Street and had not worked in years. Prosecutors say he concocted a scheme to raffle off the house and, in the process, make himself $1 million. Raffle tickets would sell for $25 apiece, with the proceeds going to the Child Crisis Center. Investigators say Marin climbed Mount Everest to generate publicity for the raffle, doing interviews with local television stations from the mountain. But Joe Epps, the forensic accountant who unraveled Marin's personal finances for investigators, told CNN it was all a ploy. Doctors feared mass suicide after deadly 'sweat lodge,' survivor says . ""What happened was he paid $2,550,000 for the house and set up with a couple of friends of his a bogus second mortgage designed to increase the value of the house for $950,000, a second mortgage that didn't really exist,"" he said. Epps said the ploy was intended to make $1 million for Marin while also making him look as though he was helping charity. But in April 2009, the Arizona attorney general ruled the raffle was illegal. By then, Marin was six months from having to make a balloon payment of roughly $2 million to lenders or risk a major jump in his monthly payments. His financial world was collapsing. ""I don't think he really thought this through, and it ended up where he had to do something that was pretty wacky, which was burn down his house,"" said Rubin. Early July 5, 2009, fire engulfed Marin's Biltmore home. He called 911 from his upstairs bedroom, then emerged from the burning home wearing SCUBA gear that happened to have been in his bedroom. ""Every fireman on the scene was, 'You're not going to believe this guy -- he came out of a ladder out of his master bedroom wearing a SCUBA tank, a SCUBA mask and a snorkel,'"" said Phoenix Fire Captain Jeff Peabody. ""Yeah, you're right, I find that odd."" Speaking after the fire from his hospital bed, Marin recounted his improbable escape. ""I realized that I actually had some air left in that tank, and that's what enabled me to get back to the window and deploy that ladder,"" he told a reporter. ""If I hadn't had those two things, we wouldn't be talking."" Peabody says he found four locations in the house where fires had been intentionally set and a line of phone books that helped the fire spread. Marin's attorney said last week that his client had shown no signs of being suicidal. ""It was a gigantic shock,"" he said. ""I think it's fair to say that we certainly had no inkling that this was going to happen. I'm not aware that anybody did.""

"(CNN) -- Venezuela on Tuesday rejected a number of recommendations made by U.N. member countries as part of a human rights evaluation by the world body. Of 148 recommendations made in the Universal Periodic Review by the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland, Venezuela accepted 95 of them, and is considering 15 more. But it rejected 38 recommendations that touched on judicial independence, freedom of the press and protection of nongovernmental organizations. Venezuela's vice minister of foreign affairs, Temir Porras Ponce de Leon, said that the country rejected these recommendations because they were not legitimate. The recommendation process ""saw people who came here to disguise as recommendations what are in fact groundless statements,"" he said, labeling the rejected suggestions ""disrespectful and interfering comments."" Among the recommendations offered by other countries and rejected by Venezuela were: . --""Respect the independence of the judiciary"" (United States) --""Ensure independent, open and transparent selection procedures based on merit for judges and prosecutors"" (United Kingdom) --""Step up its efforts to guarantee freedom of expression as well as the safety of journalists in the country"" (Indonesia) Porras Ponce de Leon called these ""marginal"" recommendations made by ""old empires."" The Human Rights Council is a U.N. body made up of 47 countries and its goal is to address human rights in all U.N. countries. Among the council's duties are a review of every U.N. member's progress on the issue of human rights. The process, known as the Universal Periodic Review, happens every four years. Each country is assigned a ""troika"" of countries who lead the review effort. For Venezuela, its trio was Guatemala, Burkina Faso and the Czech Republic. Another rejected recommendation of note was one asking Venezuela to comply with the rulings of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The court recently ruled in favor of an opponent of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Opposition politician Leopoldo Lopez had argued that he had been unjustly banned from running for office. The court agreed, and Lopez has surged as a top contender to challenge Chavez in next year's election, but it remains to be seen if Venezuela will abide by the ruling. Venezuela also rejected a call to support the independent work of NGOs and to defend human rights activists in the country. The majority of rejected recommendations were related to accusations that have been lobbed at Venezuela, but rejected by its leaders. International groups have accused Chavez of using a friendly judiciary to silence critics and the press. But Chavez maintains that there is robust freedom of expression in his country. But, as Porras Ponce de Leon noted, Venezuela is already implementing a majority of the recommendations that it agreed with. In several cases, the recommendations it accepted sounded similar to ones it rejected. For instance, it agreed to ""support the activities of human rights defenders and independent nongovernmental organizations,"" as suggested by Canada. It also agreed with Brazil to strengthen the protection of human rights workers. It also agreed to ""continue to expand its legal framework for the promotion and protection of human rights,"" a recommendation by Indonesia. During an earlier appearance before the council, Venezuela argued that it had five separate branches of government and noted that women headed three of those. The Venezuelan Constitution protects freedom of expression, but those who exercise it will be responsible for that content, the country argued. Other successes of the Venezuelan government included an increase in school enrollment of 24% between 1998 and 2010, and a social mission that has offered 24 million Venezuelans free health care, it said. ""We must make sure this is not about double standards. We must make sure there is no manipulation of the dialogue of human rights to try to crush countries who fight for their independence,"" Porras Ponce de Leon said.","The U.N.'s Human Rights Council conducted a review of Venezuela .

"(CNN) -- Despite a thrilling victory at the British Grand Prix that saw Mark Webber close the gap on world championship leader Fernando Alonso, Red Bull insist they are in no rush to offer him a new contract. The Australian chalked up his second victory of the season at Silverstone, hunting down the Ferrari of Alonso at the climax of a hugely tactical race. Webber closed the gap between himself and his Spanish rival to 16 points with the halfway point in the campaign fast approaching. Though the 35-year-old is emerging as a leading contender to claim his maiden Formula One title and despite speculation linking him with a switch to Ferrari, Red Bull insist they are relaxed about his contract. Webber pips Alonso to take British GP at Silverstone . ""I think that very simply we have a great relationship with Mark,"" team boss Christian Horner told gathered reporters. ""As always with him, things are pretty straightforward. ""This is his seventh season with the team. He has had all of his success in F1 with this team and we would like to see that continue. ""Inevitably there is an awful lot of speculation surrounding Ferrari, but we are only focused on ourselves. We cannot control what other people say or do, and I think that Mark feels comfortable in the team."" The marque also boast defending double world champion Sebastian Vettel amongst their ranks, and Webber has been outspoken in the past about having to play second fiddle to the German. But Horner confirmed that contract talks with Webber are on the agenda in the not too distant future and praised Vettel for claiming a podium place at Silverstone. ""Mark wants to be in the team next year and therefore, as we have always stated, during the summer we will sit down and talk about the future,"" he said. ""And that period of time is obviously coming up pretty close now, so over the next few weeks we will be talking about 2013. Mark has given me every indication that he is very happy here, and you can see that in his driving. ""He is driving very well this year, he has won two big races now -- the Monaco Grand Prix and the British Grand Prix, and I think his drive at Silverstone was excellent. Latest Formula One standings . ""It was great for him to win for the team at our local race, and obviously coming from just up the road as well, and to have Sebastian up there on the podium after a difficult first lap again was a double bonus."" Meanwhile, Ferrari team boss Stefano Domenicali thinks the constructors' title will be as closely fought as the drivers' championship this year. Red Bull have dominated in each of the last two years and though they are out in front again this season, the gap to Ferrari is only 64 points. Domenicali said: ""If we look at the situation of Silverstone, with the first four cars, it means we have made a step in the right direction from the performance point of view. But it is a very open championship,"" he said. ""I don't believe honestly that the others will stay behind. I am sure McLaren will fight to come back, and the others are very close. ""I was impressed by the pace of Lotus. If you look at (Romain) Grosjean, if you look at the first lap he pitted and then he finished sixth. So the field is very tight.""","Red Bull say they are in no rush to discuss a new contract for Mark Webber .

"(CNN) -- An Egyptian couple has been charged with putting their child at risk and attempted smuggling after security officers at an airport in the United Arab Emirates found their 5-month-old boy hidden in a small handbag. Police said the baby was discovered by an X-ray screening at Sharjah International Airport as the couple was traveling through the airport. The infant is in good condition, police said. According to Sharjah police, the couple arrived in the UAE last Friday but were not allowed to enter the country because they didn't have a visa for the infant.

"Washington (CNN) -- As President Obama announced the first national HIV/AIDS strategy earlier this week, outside the gates of the White House, 3 percent of the District of Columbia's population continues to live with the disease. HIV/AIDS rates in the district are ""on par with Uganda and some parts of Kenya"" where the disease has raged for years, says Shannon Hader, Washington's former HIV/AIDS administration director. Three percent of Washingtonians live with HIV/AIDS, according to a study released by the district in 2009. The accepted threshold for a ""generalized and severe epidemic,"" according to the study, is 1 percent. Flanked by national health care administrators and community activists, Obama said his national strategy is to increase prevention and improve treatment while reducing disparities among groups hardest-hit by the disease. In Washington, that's the African-American community, according to activists. ""In Washington, D.C. there's a huge disparity through race. The African-American community bears a huge burden of HIV in D.C. -- way above and beyond the proportions of the demographics of the D.C. area,"" says Justin Goforth, who works with the Whitman-Walker Clinic, a health center specializing in HIV/AIDS care. And it's estimated that a third to half of Washington residents living with the disease don't know it, Goforth said. Part of the problem is the stigma in the African-American community related to the disease, he said. Guy Jenkins was 17 when he was infected with the virus that causes AIDS. Now 28, the gay African-American man has become an advocate within his community, speaking to groups whenever possible. But he believes the best way to reach his peers is through faith-based organizations, to stop the stigma related to testing and having the disease. ""It's a religious thing, mainly a lot of the churches don't tend to back it [HIV/AIDS testing and education] and because they don't back it and [the church] is the backbone of the black community, we find ourselves hiding behind doors."" ""We don't tend to take to homosexuality or HIV/AIDS very well,"" Jenkins says. ""It's always a tendency to put the blame on someone else. ... We tend to say it's another person, they didn't tell us, they didn't let us know what was going on. It does stand true to this day."" It's something Jenkins knows first-hand. ""For me, it took a long time to get over the stigma, get out of the closet, to stop hiding behind my status."" Goforth also believes faith-based initiatives would be helpful. His organization has worked to identify area churches where regular testing and counseling could occur. He says the effort has yielded some positive results. ""I think in the last three or four years in this community, we slowed the freight train down and we now are looking to turn that freight train around."" Both men are hopeful that more federal dollars might help. ""Money makes the world go round,"" Jenkins said. But more important, they agree the money must be carefully targeted to the communities hardest hit. ""Federal dollars need to pour to those communities, to do education, to do outreach, to do testing campaigns, and to aggressively link those people to care. It really is to get people to medical care and to treatment,"" Goforth said. Obama told the crowd assembled at the White House, ""We're here because we believe that while HIV transmission rates in this country are not as high as they once were, every new case is one case too many."" For Goforth, who tested HIV positive 18 years ago, the daily battle to reduce infections is more than just a job. ""I have a very personal stake in my career,"" he says. ""I sometimes say, I come to work to save myself every day.""","3 percent of D.C. residents live with HIV/AIDS, according to study released in 2009 .

"London, England (CNN) -- Running a technology news site based in South Africa that focuses on tech news from Africa and Emerging Markets it's to be expected that I am a little attached to the region. According to a Mckinsey report ICT spend in Sub-Saharan Africa is approximately $70 billion and will nearly double by 2015. There is also no doubt Africa is on fire right now when it comes to being at the forefront of innovation in mobile (which is where the future of the web lies) with hubs in Kenya and Nigeria. Read more: How mobile broadband can transform Africa . So naturally when the ""all star entrepreneur"" panel took the LeWeb stage, I asked: ""So are any of you investing in Africa?"" The panel: ""No"". No? why not? TechCrunch founder and former editor Michael Arrington says it's because he hasn't been pitched anything from Africa. The rest of the panel, included: YouTube founder Chad Hurley, Digg founder Kevin Rose, and Skype founder, Niklas ZennstrÃÂ¶m. LeWeb is an event that champions the next stage in our online evolution and yet there seems to be very little African presence or discussion around the future of the web there. More: 10 African tech voices to follow on Twitter . More and more are accessing content on their mobile devices, because let's face it, this is where the world is heading. As Africans we arrived late to the internet party and most of the cool innovative party favors were gone. But we are hungry for access and content. Hence the huge potential in Africa for mobile app creators and companies that rely in the mobile space. Few of the companies presenting at LeWeb seems to have a focus in Africa, they seem intent on conquering the European market. Yes some want to conquer China and the rest of Asia too. But why are they ignoring Africa? What did we do? A few questions immediately come to mind. Is it a case of access? Internet penetration? Access . Is that still a major issue? According to the head of GSMA, there are 695 million mobile subscriptions in Africa and it is predicted to hit 735 million by the end of 2012. The most common mobile device in southern parts of Africa is the Samsung E250 and it can access the web. More than 5% of Sub-Saharan Africans own the Nokia N73, according to researchers at TNS Global. Mobile penetration in Africa is about 70% or so. Access? Done. Read more: Mobile phone: Weapon against global poverty . Internet Penetration . According to research from Internet World Stats, Africa still has the world's lowest internet penetration rate at 13.5%. Not an attractive figure for potential investors maybe? No, it says there is huge potential for growth. That figure says that there is an 86.5% growth potential if we want to add numbers to it. Low internet doesn't mean a deadzone. Africa is moving on quite swiftly then. There are companies such as Google, that recognize this growth potential in Africa and they are beginning to invest in the continent. Google has launched the Umbono project in South Africa and Tahrir2 in Egypt. Read more: Humans, lose your cyberphobia . I suppose the argument could be that LeWeb isn't focused on Africa because it is designed for Europe and how technology is shaping the continent. Maybe, but most of the speakers are from the USA. All are innovating in various ways true but there are equally innovative and quite frankly more useful products coming out of Africa. Where are the speakers from Africa? Someone from Ushahidi for instance should be here. The non-profit software company that develops open source software for information collection, visualization and interactive mapping. Surely it has more to say about the innovative use of technology than Path. Then there is innovation in social and communication companies such as Mxit, which is a mobile communication platform across all types of devices, and if you listen to its new CEO Alan Knott-Craig Jnr, it is well on its way to ""conquering the African market"". This particular conference is backed by government. That signals something important: European government cares about innovation in tech and perhaps innovating with it. Take note here African governments. When I bumped into Michael Arrington before his session he seemed to think there isn't much Africa can do for his fund. He also seems to think there is a security issue in Africa. Can this really still be the notion that Africa has nothing to offer when it comes to the web and how we are evolving? Take a trip to Cape Town, Lagos and Nairobi or attend an Africa Gathering event, which champions African tech growth, and see how wrong you are.

"(CNN) -- Within weeks of British student Meredith Kercher's death in the vibrant college town of Perugia, Italy, prosecutors and police declared the case closed. They'd seized two knives in their search for the murder weapon. They took DNA from the room where Kercher was killed. And at least one suspect had confessed to being at the murder scene. Or so they said. Kercher had been stabbed in a sexual misadventure, officials said. And they knew the killers. American Amanda Knox, Kercher's roommate; Italian Raffaele Sollecito, Knox's boyfriend; and Ivory Coast native Rudy Guede, a drifter known in the area, had their pictures splattered across the world's media. Knox's photo was even hung in the police plaza alongside Italy's most infamous mobsters and criminals. The prosecution case seemed a sensational slam-dunk, almost too good to be true. Knox's supporters say that's because it is. ""In the beginning, all of this supposed evidence was being leaked, showing what sounded like a pretty convincing case,"" Anne Bremner, a lawyer and former prosecutor working with the group Friends of Amanda, told CNN. The case couldn't look more different depending on where you stand. Knox's murder trial is entering its final stages, with closing arguments beginning November 20. The jury will begin deliberating December 4. But there is still no agreement on the key pieces of evidence that prosecutors say convict her and the defense says clear her. Behind the Scenes: How we examined the evidence . In Knox's corner: her friends and family from Seattle, Washington. For them, she is the victim - railroaded by an overzealous Italian prosecutor, who faces charges of prosecutorial misconduct in another case. Knox's supporters say he's tried to force the evidence to fit his theory of what happened. And with negative and often false details about the case appearing in the press - all for the jury to read - Knox supporters fear she could be convicted regardless of the facts. On the other side: Perugia's prosecutor Giuliano Mignini. For him and his colleagues, the answer is simple - Guede, Knox and Sollecito are all responsible for leaving Kercher partially clothed, strangled and with her throat cut on November 2, 2007. See a timeline of the case . The knife . The crime scene was gruesome. The 21-year old British student was found under a duvet on the floor by her bed, covered in blood. A bloody handprint was streaked on the wall above her. A source close to the prosecution says Kercher was held down while she was strangled and stabbed. The source says Sollecito's 6 Â½-inch kitchen knife was used to slit her throat and then taken back to his apartment. It is perhaps the biggest piece of evidence the prosecution has presented against Knox. Knox's DNA is on the handle and that of Kercher is on the blade, said a source close to the prosecution who did not wish to be identified discussing an ongoing case. Kercher had never been to Sollecito's apartment and wouldn't have come in contact with the knife, he said, yet there was her DNA. Those ""unmistakable facts"" show the knife played a role in the murder, the source said. Bremner and experts testifying for the defense say there is no way the knife could be the murder weapon. Dr. Carlo Torre, a leading forensics expert in Italy, testified that the knife taken from Sollecito's apartment wouldn't have made the wounds on Kercher's body. ""It doesn't match the size or shape [of the wounds,]"" Bremner told CNN. ""And Sollecito's knife also doesn't match a bloody outline of a knife left on the bedding."" Bremner, who offered her legal advice pro bono to the Knox family, questioned the validity of the DNA evidence, saying the knife had been ""improperly transported in a shoe box."" Watch Amanda Knox's parents discuss the case . Furthermore, Bremner said the jury heard from defense expert Sarah Gino, a geneticist and private coroner in Italy, who said that the DNA sample was too small to be definitive. Bremner said the presence of Knox's DNA on the knife handle was no surprise, as the couple had dinner at his house occasionally. Prosecutors say just because the knife doesn't match everything doesn't mean it wasn't used. The source close to the prosecution said it was possible, based on the wounds, that several different items made them. Damning DNA or 'Fellini Forensics' On the night Kercher was killed, Knox and her boyfriend say they were at his house watching a movie and smoking hashish. Their recollection of events, they admitted, was hazy from the drugs, but both swore they went back to the house the next morning. Knox says she was unable to gain entry - and called police. For their case, prosecutors had to prove that Knox and Sollecito - who had recently started dating - were lying and place them at the home when Kercher was killed. Some reports spoke of a scurry of people - more than one - on the night of the murder around the house. It was a positive lead for prosecutor Mignini - but came to nothing in court. But the prosecution had more evidence in the form of a bra clasp, one that fell to the floor after the murderer cut Kercher's bra in half before she was killed. And on it was Sollecito's DNA. Bremner says that evidence on the clasp is fundamentally flawed, like much from the crime scene collection, calling the work ""Fellini forensics."" ""In the [crime scene] video, you can see it went from being white in color to nearly black because it got so dirty being moved around,"" Bremner said of the clasp, noting that tainted the only evidence that placed Sollecito at the scene. Bremner described other errors she saw on the crime scene video. ""They were putting their fingers in Kercher's wound, they were shaking out evidence, picking up hairs and dropping them,"" she said. ""Some people didn't wear gloves or had their hair draping on the floor, they crashed into a window at one point and threw aside evidence. It was just wrong on all levels."" The prosecution source maintains the crime scene was handled properly, and the evidence shows what it shows. The source says it's up to the defense to prove otherwise. Biggest case for Italy or the 'greatest travesty' ever? Knox's introduction to the world came in a whirlwind of tabloid headlines. The prosecution touted hard evidence early that they said unquestionably showed they had their killers. There was a footprint in Knox and Kercher's bathroom that was attributed to Sollecito - though later analysts admitted it belonged to Guede, who was convicted of Kercher's murder in 2008. The prosecution also presented what they called a confession by Knox, but Knox later said any apparent admission she was at the scene was made when investigators told her to imagine what she might have seen if she had been there. The argument became moot when a higher court ruled the alleged confession could not be used because the statement was made without an attorney or translator present. The tabloid headlines continue as the trial closes. Media around the world focus on Knox's sexual history, what clothes she wears to court and whether a bump on her lip means the girl they dubbed ""Foxy Knoxy"" has herpes. It's all a distraction from the lack of evidence, Bremner said. ""It's the greatest travesty of a prosecution ever,"" Bremner said. ""It's so ludicrous. You've got to have a theory, or a motive, but the theory has to fit the facts somehow. And in this case, there's no solid evidence, no motive and no match whatsoever."" Knox's supporters maintain that the prosecution did get one thing right - putting Guede behind bars. He chose a fast-track trial, separate from Sollecito and Knox, and was convicted of murder and attempted sexual assault and sentenced to 30 years. They believe he was Kercher's sole killer. He is appealing the verdict. They believe Knox and Sollecito are only being prosecuted because they were flaunted so publicly as the killers, and it would look bad for officials to admit they got it wrong. The prosecution source rejects that, and portrays Knox, Sollecito and Guede as three people who together ended the life of the young British woman. And they say the way Knox originally pointed the finger at another man - who was cleared with an alibi - shows she had something to hide. Both sides agree the truth is in the evidence, and it will soon be for the jury to decide which version they believe.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration is lifting the moratorium on deep-water oil drilling -- put in place after the Gulf oil spill disaster -- for operators who comply with tough new rules and regulations, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced Tuesday. ""There will always be risks associated with deep-water drilling,"" Salazar said. ""We have reached a point where we have significantly reduced those risks."" The six-month moratorium was first issued by Salazar in May after the April 20 explosion of BP's Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico that killed 11 people and triggered one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history. An estimated 4.9 million barrels (206 million gallons) of oil gushed into the Gulf before the broken well, 5,000 feet below the surface, was capped. Salazar's initial moratorium was overturned by a federal judge whose ruling was upheld by an appeals court. The interior secretary then issued a second ban in June that was scheduled to expire in November. Critics of the ban, including Republican leaders, Gulf state officials and Gulf Coast residents, said it would only hurt oil and gas workers in the already hard-hit coastal communities, where hundreds of jobs were lost because of the disaster. Environmental groups and other supporters of the moratorium argued it was necessary due to a lack of effective regulation of deep-water drilling that allowed the Deepwater Horizon explosion and subsequent spill to occur. Tuesday's decision came three weeks before congressional elections in which Democrats are expected to lose seats in both chambers, and possibly lose control of the House. Asked if the move was politically motivated to help Gulf state candidates in tough races, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said it was based on the completion of a proper policy review. ""This is a very deliberative policy process,"" Gibbs said. ""It puts in place some important safety steps to ensure that when it is done again, it is done safely."" Salazar said the moratorium provided time to make sure similar accidents involving a failed piece of equipment called a blowout preventer wouldn't occur, and that rig operators were prepared to deal with worst-case scenarios if it did happen. Under the new requirements, operators must show that their proposed development and exploration plans can deal with potential blowouts and undergo detailed inspections and design reviews of blowout preventers by independent third parties, said Michael Bromwich, the new head of the federal agency that oversees offshore oil drilling. Bromwich said it might take time for companies to come into full compliance, but he expected some permits for resumed drilling to be approved by the end of the year. ""We will not approve permits without vital supplemental information required by the rules,"" said Bromwich, director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement. Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, a critic of the moratorium, called Tuesday's announcement a good first step but said more was needed to help the region's oil and gas industry get back to work. ""This means that the administration must continue to accelerate the granting of permits in shallow and deep water, and provide greater certainty about the rules and regulations industry must meet,"" Landrieu said in a statement. Landrieu has blocked Senate consideration of President Barack Obama's nomination of Jacob Lew to become the new director of the White House Office of Management and Budget to protest the moratorium. Her statement said she would study the situation in coming weeks before deciding whether to lift her hold on the nomination when the Senate returns from recess after the November 2 congressional elections. Gibbs told reporters that the Lew nomination was unrelated to the oil spill issue and he criticized Landrieu for playing politics. ""We have said from the beginning that the hold was unwarranted and outrageous,"" he said. The chairman of the House Energy and Environment subcommittee, Democratic Rep. Edward Markey of Massachusetts, praised the moratorium as a necessary step to instill safety in the drilling industry. ""This deepwater drilling suspension was always about keeping the Gulf workers and waters safe from another oil spill, and it has been effective in doing so,"" Markey said in a statement. ""The new rules that the Interior Department has issued will help ensure that if oil companies are going to drill ultra-deep, they are doing so in a manner that is ultra-safe."" Environmental groups questioned if enough had been done to prevent another rig explosion and spills like the one that took oil giant BP and the government months to contain. ""Today's actions are premature,"" said a statement from Peter Lehner, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""The difficult clean-up process in the Gulf has taught us prevention is key. To ensure a disaster like this never happens again, we must know what caused it in the first place. We're still waiting for that answer and until we get it -- the moratorium should remain in place."" David Guest, an attorney for Earthjustice, said it was ""surprising the federal government thinks it has so quickly resolved all the problems that contributed to the spill."" ""We learned from this spill that we have only a tiny fraction of what's necessary to control deep water oil spills,"" Guest said in a statement.

"Seattle, Washington (CNN) -- When Amanda Knox's parents head to Italy for closing arguments in their daughter's murder trial they'll be carrying a present they hope desperately she can use soon: a plane ticket home. In that purchase lies one family's entire hope. Curt Knox and Edda Mellas say their daughter is nothing like the person they've seen depicted before and during her trial. They grimace at the description prosecutors have used in court: that Amanda Knox was a resentful American so angry with her British roommate Meredith Kercher that she exacted revenge during a twisted sex misadventure at their home two years ago. Prosecutors say Knox directed then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito and another man infatuated with her, Rudy Guede, to hold Kercher down as Knox played with a knife before slashing Kercher's throat. ""She is totally nonviolent, almost a passive person,"" Mellas told CNN in a joint interview with her former husband. So passive was Knox, the parents said, that she couldn't even continue a kickboxing class because she felt it was too violent. She was so caring, they said, that she would make her friends stop a car to let a spider out rather than kill it. Knox was an easy child to raise in Seattle, Washington, along with her younger sisters Deanna and Ashley, her parents said. She took to soccer early on but hit the books as hard as she played. It was on the field that she earned the nickname Foxy Knoxy, though they say it was rarely used and taken out of context when Kercher was found killed to portray their daughter as a sex-hungry party animal. ""It was totally associated to soccer and how she prepared herself as a defender, waiting to take on a striker going down,"" Curt Knox said. ""So how people read this nickname is totally wrong."" Eventually, though a star player at college, Knox gave up the sport to focus on her education. She knew she wanted to study in Italy and wouldn't be able to leave the team to go abroad. Her mother said she threw herself into jobs to help the family save for the trip, working as a soccer coach, a barista and in a gallery. They recall a young woman far different from the wild party girl depicted by prosecutors, one they said found more enjoyment in going to a coffee house and reading a book than going out to a club. They say she met her former boyfriend and co-accused Sollecito at a classical concert. Yes, they concede, Knox, now 22, and Sollecito say they were smoking marijuana and having sex at his home the night Kercher was killed, but that was as wild as it got. They reject the idea of revenge as a motive for Knox to kill Kercher. Mellas said her daughter e-mailed and called to tell her about her new roommate regularly. Knox told her they got along great and spent time together, going to libraries and a chocolate festival. What has happened in Perugia, Italy, is unfathomable to them. On November 2, 2007, at 4 a.m. in Seattle, Mellas was awakened by the phone. ""Amanda called [and said] 'I hate to wake you up, but something's not right here, I think someone's been in my house,' "" Mellas recalled. The door to the home she shared with Kercher had been ajar when she came home that morning, and when Knox got out of a quick shower, she noticed drops of blood. Kercher's door was locked, and Knox couldn't reach her, she told her mother, adding that Sollecito was calling the police. Later, when officers broke down the door to Kercher's room, Mellas said her daughter struggled to understand what was going on, hanging on the few words of Italian she understood at the time. ""They were screaming 'A foot, a foot,' that's what they could see,"" Mellas recalled Amanda Knox saying. When she learned Kercher was dead in the room, a hysterical Knox called her mother, Mellas remembered. ""We were constantly on the phone,"" she said. ""She was tired, scared, there was a murderer out running around and she was afraid to be alone."" On the day Knox was arrested, Mellas was flying to Italy to be with her daughter, to comfort her and help her find a new place to live since her home was still a crime scene. But Mellas' plane was diverted to Switzerland, where she switched on her phone and learned that Knox had been charged with murder. ""I felt physically ill, I went to the bathroom to throw up. I was stuck [in Switzerland] for five hours,"" Mellas recalled, beginning to cry. By the time she reached Italy and was allowed to see her daughter, Mellas had already heard news reports that Knox had confessed. She was flabbergasted and confused. See the evidence against Amanda Knox . ""It was horrible. We cried most of the time,"" Mellas recalled of the first meeting. ""But we held each other and it all made sense. She told me what happened in the interrogation, how they asked her to imagine the possibilities. She talked about being hit, screamed at, threatened; it was the most horrible thing she had ever been through in her entire life."" But even with the way Knox has been treated and portrayed, her parents know they are the lucky parents in this case. ""As parents, the Kercher family received the worst phone call they could get,"" Curt Knox said, adding he believes Kercher has gotten lost in the sensational coverage. ""At least our daughter called us."" After the arrest, Mellas was sure there was a mix-up or problems with translation that would soon be cleared up. But they weren't. When Guede was later arrested in Germany, police said he had been speaking to a friend on a Skype call monitored by police and had been talking about being at Kercher's house. Mellas and Curt Knox were sure again that everything would be fixed. During the conversation, despite saying that he knew who Amanda Knox was, he never indicated she was at the home the night of the murder. But after being jailed, his story changed, and he pointed the finger at Knox and her then-boyfriend, Sollecito. Her family said they've tried to shield Knox from knowing how high-profile the case has gotten and how people are talking about her, discussing what she wears to court and what kind of person she is. But she does know she may be going to jail for a very long time. During closing arguments, prosecutors asked for her to be sentenced to life in prison, shocking her family who had expected a demand for 30 years. Read about the case against Amanda Knox . Still, at occasional prison visits, Curt Knox and Mellas try to give Knox a light at the end of the tunnel. ""We have to try and put on a face that it is going to work out,"" Mellas said, beginning to cry. ""We keep telling her it's taking way longer than expected but she will get out of there. They will not put an innocent 20-year-old in jail, they just can't."" They take solace and hold onto the moments the court allows Knox to share with her parents after the trial has recessed each day. ""They allowed us to go into the back room and say goodbye and hug her, tell her we love her,"" Curt Knox said choking up. ""Just those few seconds are worth a lot.""","Parents of Amanda Knox say they still hope murder trial will acquit their daughter .

"(CNN) -- The dangerous heat wave blamed for as many as 22 deaths spread into the eastern United States on Wednesday, extending its reach across nearly half the U.S. population, officials said. About 141 million people in a 1 million-square-mile area were under heat advisories and warnings, Justin Kenney, spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, tweeted. The National Weather Service said, ""These triple-digit temperatures are forecast to remain in place across the eastern U.S. through Saturday before cooling off slightly to the mid-90s by Sunday."" ""After several days of deadly heat and humidity as many as 22 people have died,"" the National Weather Service reported Wednesday afternoon. In Oklahoma, four heat-related deaths have been confirmed since May, said Cherokee Ballard, spokesperson for the state medical examiner. Three of those occurred in the past 30 days, including the deaths of a 3-year-old boy in a car in Norman and a 69-year-old man from Blackwell, she said. Another eight Oklahoma deaths may potentially be related to the heat, Ballard told CNN, with most occurring in July. For parts of the country that have already been scorched, some relief was forecast to arrive later Wednesday, the weather service said. A cold front moving across Montana Wednesday ""will significantly drop temperatures across the north central U.S. for the rest of the week, though locations across the central and southern Plains and parts of the Midwest will not see much change from the extended period of heat."" But in the East, some of the worst temperatures were just setting in. Excessive-heat watches, warnings and heat advisories were in effect in more than 30 states Wednesday, in what the weather service described as ""a large portion of the central U.S. and Ohio River Valley, as well as portions of the mid-Atlantic and northeastern states. Temperatures will feel like 100 to 110 degrees or higher during the afternoon hours."" The heat wave in recent days has brought heat index values -- which measure how hot it feels -- to as high as 131, the weather service said. Heat indices on Tuesday reached 129 in Newton, Iowa; 121 in Taylorville, Illinois; 122 in Gwinner, North Dakota; and 123 in Hutchinson, Minnesota. Minneapolis recorded its highest dew point ever, 82 degrees, on Tuesday.  The dew point temperature is a measure of atmospheric moisture. Part of what makes the heat wave so dangerous is that it offers no break, even at night. Chicago on Tuesday tied its record for the warmest low temperature of 78 degrees.  In Rockford, Illinois, temperatures dropped down only to 76 degrees -- the warmest on record. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said people in areas affected by extreme heat should drink more water than usual -- and not wait until they feel thirsty.  ""Avoid alcohol or liquids containing high amounts of sugar,"" the CDC says. The CDC also recommends taking cool showers or baths and avoiding direct sunlight.  ""Check on those most at-risk twice a day,"" the CDC said.

"LIMA, Peru (CNN) -- A mayor in Peru has suggested that the federal government legalize illicit drugs and administer them through the national health ministry, a newspaper reported Friday. Peruvian authorities show the press 1,500 kilograms of cocaine seized in March 2008. Gustavo Sierra, mayor of the Surquillo district in Lima, said a federal drug law is hypocritical because it allows maximum legally allowed quantities for some drugs and plants but doesn't say where to acquire them, the Peru 21 newspaper reported in a front-page story headlined, ""Say yes to drugs?"" Sierra said the federal government should adopt his position in its war on drugs, adding that he will take the matter up with the nation's executive branch. His proposal has drawn strong criticism as well as support. Milton Rojas, a specialist with a private, nonprofit, anti-drug organization called Cedro, told Peru 21 that the mayor's initiative would lead to greater drug use. ""This is not an alternative that corresponds with Peruvian reality, given drugs' low prices and large production,"" Rojas said. ""There are no serious studies concerning the legalization of stupefacients."" In addition, Rojas said some drugs -- such as PCP -- are addictive and have bad health consequences. ""Legalizing drugs would only bring more insecurity,"" he said. ""It still would be sold on the street."" Others see it differently. Social psychologist Baldomero Cacares told Peru 21 he favors the mayor's proposal because changing the nation's drug laws is indispensable. ""I am in favor of marijuana and cocaine leaf,"" Cacares said. ""They are medicinal plants rejected by science because of the false belief that they are drugs."" It has been demonstrated, he told Peru 21, that those plants can help some diseases, including some eye treatments, anxiety and depression. ""There are modern medical treatments that use these components,"" he said. ""They are not used here."" Cocaine, he said, should be used in pharmaceutical labs again because it has demonstrated pain-relieving qualities. Cacares said he remembers a throat lozenge in the 1950s that used cocaine. Surquillo, in the central part of Peru's capital, Lima, is a lower- and middle-income residential and commercial district, parts of which are considered dangerous. Several travel Web sites warn about crime, one of them saying: ""Surquillo should be avoided, specially at night. Do not ever walk alone there. It is full of thieves and gang violence."" Surquillo is one of 43 districts that make up Lima, the district's Web site says. It has a population of about 100,000. The district has a motto on its Web site: ""Surquillo is changing. ... You change too.""","Mayor: Peru should legalize illicit drugs, administer them through health ministry .

"(CNN) -- Tropical Storm Emily formed in the Caribbean Monday, prompting area governments to issue warnings and watches, the National Hurricane Center said. Tropical storm warnings were in effect for Dominica, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and the islands of Guadeloupe, Desirade, Les Saintes and Marie Galante, meaning that tropical storm conditions were expected within 36 hours. Haiti, the U.S. Virgin Islands and St. Kitts, Nevis, Montserrat and Antigua were under a tropical storm watch. Storm conditions were possible in those areas within 48 hours. Tropical Storm Emily was located some 105 miles west of Dominica Monday night, according to the hurricane center. It was heading west at 17 miles per hour, packing winds of about 40 miles per hour, with higher gusts. Tropical storm force winds extended outward up to 70 miles. The center of the storm is expected to move across the northeastern Caribbean Sea Monday night and approach the island of Hispaniola Tuesday night and Wednesday. A long-term forecast from the National Hurricane Center showed the storm could threaten Florida by the weekend. ""This one is pretty vigorous, so we're watching it,"" said Dennis Feltgen, spokesman for the Miami-based center, before the storm formed. Aircraft was sent to the area on Monday and was expected to resume reconnaissance work on Tuesday, he said. ""This is a great reminder that we're fast approaching the beginning of the peak of the (hurricane) season,"" said Feltgen, calling on residents to get prepared now. Also on Monday, the National Hurricane Center said that Eugene became the fifth hurricane of the eastern Pacific season. Located about 435 miles south-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico, the Category 1 hurricane is not forecast to hit land.","NEW: Tropical storm warnings are in effect for Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, elsewhere .

"New York (CNN) -- In a recent piece by prominent Iranian cartoonist Mana Neyestani, we see one of his favorite characters -- a cantankerous grandfather who along with his two grandchildren is a solid supporter of the Green Movement against the regime in Iran -- having managed to tie up Larry King inside a closet and trying to disguise himself as the world renowned talk show host in order to get to interview Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Sporting his thick moustache and holding a list of tough questions in hand, the grandfather is charging out of the closet yelling at a CNN producer, ""Get out of my way! The language of this Mr. President only I understand,"" while the producer is baffled by the thick moustache that ""Larry King"" has suddenly grown. The point of the cartoon is a deep and pervasive sense of frustration that Iranians all over the world have with the inability of prominent American journalists and talk show hosts to handle the slippery Ahmadinejad. Christiane Amanpour, Charlie Rose, and Larry King in particular are being criticized for providing Ahmadinejad with a global forum to say whatever nonsense he wishes without enough of a serious challenge to his statements -- some of which are flat-out lies. Since the massively contested presidential election of June 2009, scores of peaceful demonstrators have been arbitrarily arrested, tortured, and murdered; prominent human and women's rights activists, reformists, and labor union leaders have been arrested and subjected to Stalinist show trials and given long and punishing prison terms; the leaders of the opposition Green Movement have been systematically harassed and intimidated; the universities have gone through yet another round of ideological purges; yet another cultural revolution to silence and suppress non-conformist ideas is well under way; an entire cadre of independent-minded journalists have been forced into the indignity of exile -- and yet few of these atrocities manages to gain much attention in the conversations that these prominent American journalists have with Ahmadinejad. That sense of frustration is not limited to Iranians. Jon Leyne, the distinguished senior BBC correspondent has written a wonderful essay discussing the difficulties of interviewing Ahmadinejad. Mr. Leyne points out how Ahmadinejad succeeds ""in moving the agenda onto a ground of his own choosing, and few, if any, of the Western journalists who have interviewed him have scored many points off him."" The former USA Today correspondent Barbara Slavin has also written an article, ""How not to get played by Ahmadinejad,"" in which she too testifies that the ""Iranian president has perfected the art of slipping and sliding around even the most seasoned interviewers."" Perhaps the best example of how Ahmadinejad manages to slip away from hard questions is when Christiane Amanpour asked him about the case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, a woman charged with murder and adultery and originally condemned to death by stoning. In response to Amanpour's question, Ahmadinejad point blank said that this report is false and Ashtiani has not been condemned to death by stoning -- which was a plain lie. In anticipation of Ahmadinejad's trip to New York, the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran had in fact prepared a full preparatory list of atrocities perpetrated under the administration of Ahmadinejad's for American journalists -- with key facts and crucial issues that they might raise when interviewing him. To be sure, Amanpour did ask Ahmadinejad about executions increasing fourfold since he took office, as well as about the Iranian regime taking action against opposition leaders, including raiding their offices. And in Larry King's case, after interviewing Ahmadinejad he had a follow-up conversation with Fareed Zakaria, the host of CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS,"" in which the evasive answers of Ahmadinejad were put in proper context with more detailed attention to the internal atrocities in Iran. But still the balance of the result tipped heavily in favor of Ahmadinejad's rhetorical one-upmanship. Slavin has suggested that ""reporters need to be armed with in-depth knowledge of Iran's economy, politics and society -- and even then, they may have difficulty getting Ahmadinejad to admit the truth."" But that is not the modus operandi of a journalistic culture that is conceptually geared towards geopolitics and ""international"" politics rather than domestic matters. Ahmadinejad always wins in these encounters because he points to other atrocities by redirecting the question at the questioner, and there are plenty of atrocities around the globe. The other factor is the language barrier between Ahmadinejad and his interviewers, which he strategically uses to his advantage. ""Mr. Ahmadinejad's technique,"" Leyne points out ""is aided by the fact that most of the foreign interviews are carried out in translation -- leaving the journalist less scope for jumping in, and less time to cross-examine."" Leyne's young colleague, Bahman Kalbasi of BBC Persian has now become a Facebook phenomenon because he accosted Ahmadinejad in a hallway at the UN and shouted a succession of questions at him: ""Mr. Ahmadinejad why don't you talk to Iranian journalists? Why do you just talk to foreign journalists? Why do you run away from Iranian journalists?"" Ahmadinejad left his real surprise for after all his interviews, when during his official address to the General Assembly he effectively accused the United States government of direct involvement in the atrocities of 9/11. But in this case, President Obama had an opportunity during his subsequent interview with Kalbasi to respond to Ahmadinejad. ""For him to make the statement here in Manhattan,"" President Obama said, ""just a little north of Ground Zero, where families lost their loved ones, people of all faiths, all ethnicities who see this as the seminal tragedy of this generation, for him to make a statement like that was inexcusable,"" Obama said. Still, too many of Ahmadinejad's statements went unchallenged last week --particularly those that had to do with the vast array of atrocities in his own country. These are not problems that can be solved by handing to journalists a list of questions to ask a head of state with just too many skeletons in his closet to count. These are problems that American journalism as an institution faces as it tries to cope with and cover a far more globalized planet than we've ever seen before. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hamid Dabashi.","Mahmoud Ahmadinejad presides over regime that commits atrocities, says Hamid Dabashi .

"(CNN) -- Much of middle America baked in a heat wave Sunday, with little respite in sight as temperatures and humidity are expected to make it feel warmer than 100 degrees Fahrenheit through much of this week. Excessive heat warnings have been declared by the National Weather Service in at least 14 states Sunday, most of those in the upper Midwest. Excessive heat watches were in place in Indiana and Kentucky, with heat advisories (the least imminent of the three) in effect for four other states. Several daily temperature records were broken Sunday -- from Alpena, Michigan, south to Miami, Florida. ""This is the hottest it's been for the longest period of time,"" said Emily McNamara from Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where the temperatures were expected to hover in the mid-90s through the middle of the week. Prevent heat-related illnesses . The blistering weather won't end, but rather it will move east, once the alerts expire in most cases Wednesday or Thursday. Extreme heat is forecast to bear down on the eastern United States by the end of this week. Jacob Beitlich, a Des Moines, Iowa-based meteorologist for the National Weather Service, said that two factors contribute to make this current heat wave especially dangerous: the lack of a significant drop in temperatures overnight to allow people's bodies to cool down and relatively high humidity, which makes it feel appreciably hotter than the thermostat may indicate. In Iowa, for instance, he noted that the impact of mid-90s temperatures have been compounded by relatively high dew points in the upper 70s and low 80s. These combine to make the heat index -- a meteorological measure for how it feels outside -- spike so that it feels as hot as 126 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the weather service. ""That takes a toll on your body,"" Beitlich explained. ""When it's more humid, it's more difficult to cool down from sweating."" Gotta Watch: Heat wave solutions . The National Weather Service notes that typically extreme heat is the biggest weather-related killer in the United States, taking about 115 lives each year. That's why it and other government agencies urge people to minimize their time outdoors in periods of extreme heat, drink plenty of fluids, and keep especially close tabs on the elderly and young people. In Missouri, for one, scores of cooling centers have been established in libraries, senior centers, schools and other sites around the state to help deal with continuously high temperatures. At Target Field in Minneapolis, Minnesota Twins supporters stood in long lines to get water from coolers, used spray fans, wrapped wet towels on their head during a Sunday game -- anything to keep cool. ""It is blistering out,"" said one fan, Jeff Ferris. ""Brutal. I've probably lost 10 pounds today -- it's crazy."" Dehydration and youth sports . While the recent stretch has been particularly difficult, it's all part of what's been a continuously long, hot and in many cases dry summer in numerous locales. The weather service indicates that Oklahoma, for instance, already has had 27 days this year in which the temperature surpassed 100 degrees. Not everyone, though, in the region sweat it out this weekend. McNamara notes that the Wild West Waterpark, where she is aquatic manager, has had ""record-breaking days in terms of attendance"" in recent days, with several thousand flooding in to get wet and beat the heat. ""It's awesome,"" she said. ""You see people coming out having fun. It makes for a fast day.""

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited Cuba Wednesday and called on developing countries to unite against ""imperialism and capitalism."" ""Why are the Iranian, Cuban and Latin American people punished by the United States?"" he asked the audience attending his speech at the University of Havana. ""Have we attacked them in some way? Have we asked for more than we are owed? Never, not once. We have only ever wanted justice."" Ahmadinejad did not directly mention a bomb attack that left an Iranian nuclear scientist dead in Tehran Wednesday. But, he said, ""The capitalist system might do damage, sabotage."" Facing increasing sanctions over Iran's alleged development of nuclear weapons, Ahmadinejad is calling on friendly heads of state this week in Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba. He was expected to meet with high-ranking government officials on the island, including President Raul Castro. By Wednesday evening, the Cuban government had not made any announcement about whether Ahmadinejad had met with former President Fidel Castro. U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, a Cuban-American who has called for tougher sanctions against the island nation's government, called Ahmadinejad's itinerary a ""tour of tyrants."" ""Rallying dictators against the United States is the central agenda item of Ahmadinejad's trip to the region,"" Ros-Lehtinen said in a statement. Cuba has been under U.S. economic sanctions for 50 years. Cuba officially recognized Iran shortly after the 1979 Iranian revolution. Then-Cuban President Fidel Castro visited Iran in 2001. Cuba also aspires to become a large oil producer and is working with a Spanish company to develop between 5 million and 20 billion barrels of oil in the straits of Florida.

"(CNN) -- Scientists have discovered methane in Mars' atmosphere, raising the possibility that life might exist on the planet. Mars may be more active than previously believed, scientists say. The methane could have come from past or present subsurface microorganisms, geological activity or comets striking the planet, scientists and NASA officials said. Scientists were not sure how long the methane has been on the planet. Methane -- four atoms of hydrogen bound to a carbon atom -- is the main component of natural gas on Earth. It's of interest to astrobiologists because organisms release much of Earth's methane as they digest nutrients. Other purely geological processes, like oxidation of iron, also release methane. ""It's time, it's prudent that we begin to explore Mars looking for the possibility of a life form that's exhaling methane,"" said Lisa Pratt, professor of geological sciences at Indiana University, at a NASA news briefing Thursday. The team found methane in the Martian atmosphere by carefully observing the planet through NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility and the W.M. Keck telescope, both at Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Using spectrometers on the telescopes to spread the light into its component colors, the team detected three spectral features, called absorption lines, that together are definitive fingerprints of methane. ""Microbes that produced methane from hydrogen and carbon dioxide were one of the earliest forms of life on Earth,"" said Carl Pilcher, director of the NASA Astrobiology Institute, which partially supported the research. ""If life ever existed on Mars, it's reasonable to think that its metabolism might have involved making methane from Martian atmospheric carbon dioxide."" NASA's most recent Mars project -- the Phoenix Mars Lander mission -- came to an end in November after the solar-powered vehicle's batteries ran down as the result of a dust storm and the onset of Martian winter. Robotic instruments on the spacecraft collected and analyzed soil samples, looking for organic compounds that would indicate Mars is or was able to support life. NASA officials had landed the vehicle on an arctic plain after satellite observations indicated there were vast quantities of frozen water in that area, most likely in the form of permafrost. Scientists were able to verify the presence of water-ice in the Martian subsurface, find small concentrations of salts that could be nutrients for life, and observe snow descending from the clouds. The lander also discovered a chemical in soil near Mars' north pole that is toxic to humans but conceivably could be used as an energy source by certain microbes. The lander's findings did not rule out the possibility that life once existed or even exists now, perhaps in a deep underground aquifer, NASA officials said. NASA's next mission to the planet is the Mars Science Laboratory, a large, nuclear-powered rover with a suite of onboard scientific instruments. It is scheduled to launch in 2011 as part of NASA's long-term effort to study the early environmental history of Mars and assess whether the planet has ever been -- or still is -- able to sustain life.","New finding reveals the first detection of methane in the atmosphere of Mars .

"(CNN)  -- Each spring brings major medical meetings from the likes of the American Association for Cancer Research, the American Urological Association and the American Society for Clinical Oncology, to name a few. These meetings began as forums for scientists to meet and discuss findings and generate ideas. They offer opportunities for physicians to learn about new studies and possible new treatments, and for those interested in medicine, the meetings are fascinating and enjoyable. But over the past several decades, these gatherings have more and more become venues for drug companies and medical device manufacturers to tell physicians about their drugs and medical hardware. Today, much of the presented research is sponsored by industry, and these medical meetings are increasingly an opportunity for companies to make a name for themselves by promoting their products. Doctors find themselves asking when promotion of a product or a company stops being education and becomes a naked attempt at advertising. Companies have found that the investors watch these meetings like a hawk, looking for the earliest bit of data that may show promising results for a new drug. Successful promotion of positive findings through meeting abstracts and press releases can double or triple a small company's share price. But observers note a troubling trend. It is a shame that the desire to pump up a stock price often leads to over-promotion and exaggeration of paltry scientific findings. Recently, the economic crisis in the media has led to the disappearance, through layoffs or by choice, of some wonderful, skilled and seasoned science writers. And with that comes genuine concern. The veterans have been replaced by mostly young, inexperienced writers who suddenly find themselves under pressure to turn out compelling stories about difficult scientific medical studies that are all too easy to oversimplify and misinterpret. Meanwhile, to bolster readership or numbers of viewers, the media reward reporters whose stories can lead to the most eye-grabbing headline. These reporters are well-meaning, but if they do not understand medicine and the scientific process, these articles can truly harm public health. And, in my experience, that is happening more and more often. And even more important: Reporters must understand that the motivation of every scientific report must be questioned as part of routine due diligence. The caveats from each report must also be clearly detailed in each story. From where I sit, all too often, that is not happening. This combination of scientists and businessmen enthusiastically promoting products or themselves with sales pitches, and inexperienced reporters struggling to make sense of their claims, has led to some unfortunate articles. I was motivated to write this after reading articles in reputable newspapers in the United States and Europe that a cure for breast cancer was on the horizon and a blood test was coming to market that could detect lung cancer early and save lives. Truth be told, a lab cured breast cancer in six mice. But translating these findings to humans is difficult, and experience has taught us that it likely will never happen. Some of these articles also failed to say that this is a very early piece of scientific progress at best -- and may not even be progress. As for the blood tests, I have read reports of some that are somewhat effective in finding lung cancer. But the articles failed to point out that any test will require years of more development to determine whether it's useful. They also failed to report that the study showed that the test was no more accurate than X-rays, which are not recommended by any major medical organization. Unfortunately, by the time measured voices put these stories into perspective, the media have moved on to a new story. The end result of all this is very harmful. The nonscientific public gets misled, and some of those folks who have an interest in a specific disease get their hopes up, only to be disappointed. I was taught by a wise physician that the worst thing we in medicine can do is deceive our patients. Another event that motivated me to write this opinion piece: One of the good, smart medical writers who toil in this field every day, unheralded and woefully underpaid, asked me a really good question. I realized that these good hard questions are less frequent as the good medical and scientific writers, most of whom I've had the privilege of enjoyed working with over the years, are becoming an endangered species. This decline of the professional medical and science writer is a threat to the public health as important as the latest scare story in the headlines -- perhaps even more so. Unfortunately, this is one health threat that has received little attention. Maybe it's time to change that.

"(CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Wednesday urged Middle East leaders to listen to the voices of citizens who have taken to the streets in masses to demand a change in government -- though such protests in his own country have been crushed with brute force. Ahmadinejad ""strongly recommended such leaders to let their peoples express their opinions,"" the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. ""He further urged those leaders of regional countries who respond to the demands of their nations and their revolutionary uprisings with hot bullets to join their peoples' movements instead of creating blood baths."" Anti-government protests that toppled the regimes in Tunisia and Egypt have spread across a swath of the Middle East and North Africa, including in Iran. There, opposition to the ruling clerics has simmered since the 2009 election, when hundreds of thousands of people filled Tehran's streets to denounce the re-election of Ahmadinejad as fraudulent. The demonstrators have been met with force in major Iranian cities. Security forces have opened fire in some cases and arrested hundreds of protesters in others. Opposition leaders are regularly detained and their homes and offices raided. Hard-line members of the Iranian parliament have demanded the execution of opposition leaders and former presidential candidates Mehdi Karrubi and Mir Hossein Moussavi. But Ahmadinejad, in his remarks, altogether sidestepped the simmering unrest at home. Instead, he held up Libya, saying the world was ""bewildered"" by the actions of the President Moammar Gadhafi. ""The president said it was a wonder that the ruler of a country could kill his own people using guns and tanks, and even stress that he would kill anybody who utters a word against him,"" the news agency said. Reporting from Iran has been difficult in recent weeks -- foreign journalists were denied visas, accredited journalists living in the country were restricted from covering the demonstrations and internet speed slowed to a crawl in an apparent attempt to both limit protest organizing and restrict information from being transmitted out of the country.","He asks the leaders to refrain from creating ""blood baths""

"Washington (CNN) -- As they talked publicly in generalities about a smooth transition to a new government in Egypt, U.S. officials have been working behind the scenes on ways to ""move that process forward,"" a national security spokesman said. Top members of the Obama administration stated Thursday their desire for embattled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to leave office and for inclusive negotiations to begin immediately with his political opponents. National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor added that U.S. officials have also discussed with Egyptian officials ""a variety of different ways"" in which that new government could take shape. But Vietor stressed ""all of those decisions must be made by the Egyptian people."" A senior Obama administration official knocked down a New York Times report that the Egyptians and Americans were near consensus on a specific proposal. ""It's simply wrong to report that there's a single U.S. plan that's being negotiated with the Egyptians,"" the official said. U.S. officials have made clear in recent days their desire to jumpstart talks between opposition and ruling forces in order to lay the groundwork as soon as possible for a governmental transition. That includes pressuring, besides Mubarak's government, opposition groups to engage immediately in talks. Mubarak has announced he will not seek re-election in September. Protesters, however, continue to demand that he step down immediately, with a caretaker unity government running the country until the fall elections. While some, like former Foreign Minister and Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa, believe concessions made by Mubarak presented an opportunity to build upon, members of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood have insisted no talks should take place until the president leaves office. ""It's time for both of them to roll up their sleeves,"" a senior State Department official said. ""The government has to take some steps, but the opposition has to be willing to participate in negotiations as well."" Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman made ""important statements"" about a political dialogue, the senior official said. Still, he added that the Egyptian government should allow the opposition to bring its own ideas, rather than dictate the pace and scope of a transformation to democracy. The urgent call for talks comes as the Egyptian government pushed back on what it described as ""vague"" statements from the Obama administration about the pace of transition. An Egyptian government official told CNN the White House has shown support for its ""roadmap"" for a transition up to when Mubarak's term ends in September, but said President Obama's calls for an ""orderly transition"" are at odds with his call for an immediate one. The official said Mubarak is seen as a ""receding figure"" in Egyptian politics, but warned that deposing him immediately would lead to a murky political process that would make free and fair elections difficult. According to the Egyptian constitution, the presidency would be transferred to the speaker of the parliament if Mubarak leaves power without enacting certain legislative and constitutional reforms. ""Institutionally, there is support in Egypt for this roadmap among the military, vice president and prime minister,"" said the Egyptian official. U.S. officials said they believe what transpires Friday -- when another massive anti-government protest is expected -- will be an important barometer on whether serious negotiations can take place. Demonstrators may be less willing to talk if attacked. ""It's hard to imagine if there is a day of very bad violence, it will lead to the type of dialogue that needs to take place,"" the senior State Department official said. These backroom discussions involving the U.S. and Egyptian political players come as the White House and legislators stepped up their public pressure on Mubarak's regime. On Thursday, Vice President Joe Biden talked with Suleiman and pressed him that ""credible, inclusive negotiations (should) begin immediately"" with opposition political groups, a statement from Biden's office said. That sentiment was reiterated by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, who told reporters ""it is important that we all begin to see meaningful steps, and that negotiations take place between the (current) government and a broadly based group of members of the opposition as we work through the transition toward free and fair elections."" U.S. lawmakers have also chimed in, with foreign policy veterans Sens. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, and John McCain, R-Arizona, among those calling for Mubarak to step aside for the sake of his country and people. Thursday night, the U.S. Senate gave unanimous approval to a resolution calling for Mubarak to ""immediately begin an orderly and peaceful transition to a democratic political system, including the transfer of power to an inclusive interim caretaker government, in coordination with leaders from Egypt's opposition, civil society, and military, to enact the necessary reforms to hold free, fair, and internationally credible elections this year."" The Obama administration also sharply condemned the violence that erupted Wednesday in Cairo, when pro-Mubarak supporters attacked anti-government protesters. At least eight people were killed and 836 injured, according to the Egyptian Health Ministry. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Thursday ""elements close to the government or ruling party"" carried out the violence. ""I don't think we have a sense of how far up the chain it went,"" he noted. The United States continues to walk a fine diplomatic line in the crisis, encouraging Mubarak to transition from power while stopping short of publicly asking him to step down. Officials say the restraint is needed because the White House is mindful that allies in the Middle East are concerned about American loyalty. Government contacts have expressed reservations about how vocal the Obama administration has been in pressing Mubarak, a close American ally of three decades. Other regional allies are concerned about how quickly the United States might turn on them if protests start in their countries, the State Department officials said. The White House, meanwhile, has made a deliberate decision to let Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, take the lead role in communicating with the Egyptian military about its role in the current unrest, according to two senior U.S. officials. Mullen has not told Egyptian military leaders to pressure Mubarak to step down, the officials insisted to CNN. ""That's not his role,"" one official said. Mullen is, however, trying to push the Egyptian military to maintain security, not move against peaceful protesters, and keep the violence from escalating. The U.S. government believes Mubarak will not issue a direct order to the Egyptian army to do anything because he is uncertain his orders would be followed, one official with very direct knowledge of evolving U.S. policy in the crisis told CNN. A refusal on the part of the army to obey Mubarak would spell the end of the Egyptian leader's rule, the official noted. At that point, Mubarak would have to leave the country. The U.S. belief right now, the official said, is that Suleiman is letting the army feel it is ""representing the flag of the nation"" in trying to help without making a massive move against the government. While Mullen is communicating with his Egyptian counterparts, the CIA has set up its own task force to monitor the crisis. ""The Central Intelligence Agency always surges personnel and resources as needed to meet any crisis head-on. This situation is no different, and we've established a Middle East Task Force,"" CIA spokeswoman Jennifer Youngblood said. ""Our 24/7 operations are focused on ensuring we provide the best possible insights and freshest intelligence to policymakers,"" she said. The chaotic situation has raised concerns that terrorist entities could try to exploit the situation. ""People are watching for signs that terrorists or militant groups might try to take advantage of the situation in Cairo and launch attacks,"" a U.S. official noted. ""We expect groups like al Qaeda to take advantage of instability anywhere as a means to promote their cause publicly."" Overall, the Obama administration is handling the Egyptian crisis relatively well so far, according to Nicholas Burns, a former Clinton State Department official. ""We've got to stand up, as the president is doing, for reform and democracy,"" Burns told CNN. The U.S. government needs to ""use our influence behind the scenes, and we've got a lot of influence there with President Mubarak to move him towards a fast transition."" Burns noted the importance of Egypt in terms of the Arab-Israeli conflict, shipments through the Suez Canal, and the containment of Iran, among other things. ""We've got to preserve those very real American interests,"" he said. ""This is about as difficult a challenge diplomatically as I think we have seen in many years."" Michael Rubin, an analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that while it's ""tempting to try to score political points"" in the current crisis, he's not sure Obama has responded any differently than a Republican president would have in a similar situation. In terms of backing Mubarak, all of Obama's predecessors ""kicked the can down the road until the road ran out,"" he said. The real difficulty, Rubin said, will come in the months ahead as U.S. policymakers try to prevent Egypt from following the path Iran took after 1979, when the fall of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi led to the rise of the fundamentalist regime still in power today. The U.S. needs to make clear the Egyptian elections happen ""come hell or high water,"" Rubin said, but at the same pushing to ensure armed extremist militias aren't allowed to claim the mantle of democratic legitimacy.

"Madison, Wisconsin (CNN) -- Tea Party activists supporting a bill that would slash collective bargaining rights of Wisconsin public employees flocked to Madison on Saturday, bringing a new dimension to a budget battle that shows few signs of compromise. As tens of thousands of people marched in favor or against the bill, Republican Gov. Scott Walker indicated he has the votes to pass it. ""We're going to stay firm on it,"" he said on the fifth day of large protests and political wrangling in the capital, which saw the arrival of conservative groups. ""Wisconsin is ground zero,"" said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity. ""I think it is going to determine largely whether the pampered nature of these public employees is finally reined in."" Walker has called on 14 Democratic state senators, who fled the state rather than allow a quorum permitting a vote on the bill, to return to Madison. Bill opponents say they won't allow a vote unless Walker negotiates on the plan to eliminate collective bargaining rights for everything but wages. The legislation also would require most employees to pay more for their pensions and health insurance benefits. ""I have been informed that all state and local public employees -- including teachers -- have agreed to the financial aspects of Gov. Walker's request,"" said Sen. Jon Erpenbach, a Democrat. ""This includes Walker's requested concessions on public employee health care and pension. In return they ask only that the provisions that deny their right to collectively bargain are removed. This will solve the budget challenge."" Walker, who says the state is ""broke,"" is asking legislators to pass his Budget Repair Bill to combat a $137 million shortfall through June 30. An upcoming two-year budget for 2011-13 must address a pending $3.6 billion deficit, he said. Opponents say the proposed legislation is an attack on workers' rights. Until Saturday's counter-demonstrators appeared, the growing protests since Monday were largely made up of those against Walker's plan. They remained the clear majority of those marching; many were drawn Saturday by the arrival of Walker's supporters. There were no reports of major incidents or arrests by late Saturday afternoon, and authorities expressed their gratitude. ""On behalf of all the law enforcement agencies that helped keep the peace on the Capitol Square Saturday, a very sincere thank you to all of those who showed up to exercise their First Amendment rights,"" Madison police said in a statement. ""You conducted yourselves with great decorum and civility, and if the eyes of the nation were upon Wisconsin, then you have shown how democracy can flourish even amongst those who passionately disagree."" Teachers and other public employees kept the pressure on the governor to go to the bargaining table. Madison teacher Karen Kaminsky said she wouldn't have gone to college if her father had not been in a union. ""This will break the backs of middle-class families,"" she told CNN affiliate WTMJ, adding Walker should be willing to negotiate. The governor's press secretary, Cullen Werwie, released a statement Saturday calling on Erpenbach, Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller and other Democrats to return from Illinois. ""These are many of the same senators who, two years ago, rammed through a billion dollar tax hike in 24 hours with no public input,"" the statement said. ""The quickest way to resolve the current situation is for the Democratic senators to stop shirking their responsibilities and debate the bill in Madison."" Saturday's protests inside and outside the Capitol were the largest of the week, numbering about 55,000, said Carla Vigue, spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Department of Administration. Some estimates were higher. Friday saw about 40,000 demonstrators, Vigue said. The conservative group American Majority helped organize the ""I Stand With Walker"" campaign evident this weekend in Madison. ""Buses will be coming from across the state, bringing citizens fed up with big union contracts and bloated government,"" the group said on its website. ""We win here, we win everywhere."" The defecting Democratic lawmakers say they won't return until Walker agrees to negotiate with the teacher's union on the governor's proposals to reduce the state's budget deficit by cutting benefits for its members. They also want language removed from the bill that critics say threatens the existence of all public employee unions in the state. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney addressed the continued protests Friday, saying President Barack Obama ""is very understanding of the need for state governments, governors, state legislatures to reduce spending to make tough choices to be fiscally responsible."" But he added, ""He also feels very strongly that we need not to make this an assault on the collective bargaining rights of workers in any given state. ""He understands public employees need to make sacrifices just like everyone else."" Walker's proposed legislation requires workers to cover more of their health care premiums and pension contributions, although supporters say local governments will decide on health care contributions for their employees . Walker contends the increases are ""modest"" compared to what workers in private industry pay. It also requires collective bargaining units to conduct annual votes to maintain certification, a costly procedure, and eliminates the right of unions to have dues deducted from worker paychecks.

"(CNN) -- When it comes to rock 'n' roll on the radio today -- outside the ghetto of rock-only stations --- to paraphrase punk patriarch Lou Reed, there's almost nothing going down at all. Take a look at the Billboard singles charts in 2011. The only relatively new artists to successfully cross over from the rock and alternative rock charts to the Hot 100 have been Mumford and Sons and Foster the People, and the ubiquitous genre-buster Adele has gone the other direction. As radio has become more stratified, the Top 40 format appears to have marginalized rock, focusing on tempo-driven pop, R&B, dance music and hip-hop. It's like 1989 to 1991 all over again, when the likes of Milli Vanilli, Bell Biv Devoe and Roxette dominated the airwaves and the charts. Twenty years ago, two little-known Seattle-based bands released albums that would change the music industry, both commercially and artistically. Pearl Jam's debut ""Ten"" came first. But that now-revered album, full of weighty anthems, took several months to gain traction. A few weeks later, Nirvana released its second album, ""Nevermind,"" a disc rife with noise, but also verse-chorus-verse pop structures. It quickly burned up the charts behind its lead single, ""Smells Like Teen Spirit."" Nirvana had just finished a two-week tour of Europe, opening for the underground trailblazers Sonic Youth. Filmmaker David Markey documented the tour, then returned home with his film. Soon, he realized his movie, ""1991: The Year Punk Broke"" (which was released on DVD on September 13), was going to have an adjusted focus. ""Every day, we'd come into the editing room (and say), 'Oh, yeah. Nirvana sold another million overnight,'"" Markey recalls. ""It was just surreal. It was also very exciting, because for the first time, something from my end of the world -- you know, something from the left-of-the-dial end of the world that was previously relegated to college radio (made it big)."" The success of Nirvana and the ""grunge"" movement helped open the doors for hundreds of other ""alternative"" (as ""college radio"" was re-named) acts. In reality, none of those definitions told the listener much about the bands that rode the wave to commercial and/or critical acclaim in the early to mid-'90s. Some artists, such as the Gin Blossoms and Counting Crows, sounded a lot like those heard on classic rock stations. Other bands brought some variety to radio. Without ""Nevermind,"" commercial radio stations probably may not have played the singles from underground veterans like Butthole Surfers or Cobain's heroes the Meat Puppets. While many rock bands and ""movements"" have garnered critical acclaim over the intervening two decades, commercial success is harder to come by, as radio is locking rock out of the mainstream again, says Silvio Pietroluongo, Billboard magazine's director of charts. ""You look at the top of the rock chart, and you see all kinds of bands who have had Top 40 radio hits, from Staind and Foo Fighters and Blink-182,"" he said. ""You think there'd be an appetite for Blink-182, and some stations are playing it, don't get me wrong. But on a national level, it's hard ... to get these stations to get these songs on the chart,"" he says. ""It's just not in the lexicon of Top 40 now. Top 40 has moved on away from those acts. And it's going to be a challenge to get it back."" Part of that challenge is today's fractured media landscape. In September 1991, the Internet, satellite radio, digital downloads, iPods and tablets weren't factors. Lee Leipsner, Columbia Records' senior vice president of promotions, helped Adele and Foster the People break through earlier this year. Leipsner started in the industry in the late '80s working in a record store before he moved on to a gig at Mercury Records. He says success is measured differently now, and every band has a different view of what success means. ""A big touring base,"" Leipsner said. ""Merchandise that you sell. Some sales are important. But I think building a community, building a following, building a groundswell. ...There's just so many things to measure now."" ""You've got to consider them all right now,"" he continued. ""Anything gold or platinum in the past used to be a success. Getting a gold record nowadays is very tough. Selling half a million records, albums, is one of the toughest things. The bar is a lot higher now."" The bands that broke through in '91 built communities the old-fashioned way: touring nonstop and mixing with fans in and out of clubs. A lot of those artists, including Nirvana, were influenced by the '80s post-punk and hardcore scenes that filmmaker Markey was part of. He said bands such as Sonic Youth had created benchmarks for success in that culture: a few hundred thousand units sold, airplay on MTV's 120 Minutes and headlining their own tour. Leipsner said getting close to fans is still part of the equation for artist development, but in 2011, that includes an online component. ""If (a new artist) has 200,000 Facebook friends, and he goes on tour for the next six months without a record, doing his own grass roots, selling his own CDs, putting them up when he needs to, doing his own videos, and the next thing you know, you're at 400,000, you have a better chance when you do launch an album,"" he reflected. ""You already have that audience. That tribe's already built in. They're already lined up. They're ready to go. All you have to do is ignite them."" Nirvana ignited an audience that didn't even know it was flammable in 1991, and no one -- even those close to the band -- foresaw that spontaneous combustion. ""It wasn't like anything that was planned. I don't think any great things that happen in culture and music are. It's obviously something people see and respond to. You know, I think that record was in the right place at the right time, combined with being a great record and great songs,"" Markey said. He's skeptical about anyone replicating Nirvana's success. ""The music business has changed so much, and I don't think it will happen in that 20th century way."" Markey said. ""The odds at the time were still incredibly far for what happened for them. It's like the perfect storm."" It may have been the perfect storm for Nirvana. But just like weather cycles such as El Nino, the music industry tends to repeat its trends. ""It wouldn't be surprising if you called us back in a year from now, or a year-and-a-half from now, and suddenly, there's a whole lot more rock acts on our charts, because everything is cyclical,"" said Keith Caulfield, Billboard's associate director of charts. ""Right now, we're in a very dance-pop phase, just as we were in that time in the '90s where everything was Ace of Base and La Bouche. And then in the 2000 thing, Britney and Christina. And now, we're in this Katy Perry, Britney-again era."" Leipsner agreed, with one caveat. ""Music is cyclical and it does change,"" he said. ""I do believe there will be another movement. It's starting to happen already. Will it ever achieve the numbers that it used to have? No. It just won't, because it is a bit too fragmented. But I still think great music rises to the top."" ""It's hard to predict when, but it seems like every decade, there's that bang. And you know what? You just wait for it , and you hope to be a part of it... as a music lover.""","Nirvana and the ""grunge"" movement helped open doors for hundreds of ""alternative"" acts .

"(CNN) -- Iranian lawmakers have summoned President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to answer questions before Parliament about his management of economic policies and key government ministers. The move comes after a power struggle between Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei spilled into public view last year. It is the first time since the Iranian Revolution in 1979 that the Parliament has succeeded in summoning a president to testify before it. The internal political tensions coincide with outside pressure on Iran from the United States and other countries over Tehran's nuclear program. One of the most sensitive questions lawmakers say they plan to ask concerns Ahmadinejad's failed attempt to fire Intelligence Minister Heidar Moslehi in April. When Khamenei vetoed the move, Ahmadinejad retreated from the public eye, skipping Cabinet meetings. Top officials and media outlets close to Khamenei subsequently mounted a campaign of criticism singling out Ahmadinejad. Iranian news agencies reported that Ahmadinejad's palace prayer leader, Abbas Amirifar, faced charges of ""sorcery"" after producing a controversial film. Public criticism also focused on Ahmadinejad's brother-in-law and chief of staff, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, whom Ahmadinejad appeared to have been grooming as a successor. The motion to summon Ahmadinejad, read out in Parliament on Tuesday, contained a long list of issues lawmakers want to take up with him, the semi-official Mehr News Agency reported, including ""the president's alleged resistance to accept the Supreme Leader's decree to reinstate the intelligence minister."" Other topics include ""the dismissal of the former foreign minister while on a diplomatic mission in Senegal,"" several apparently flawed economic policy efforts and ""the president's support for the promotion of the Iranian school of thought instead of the Islamic school of thought,"" according to Mehr. Lawmakers say that the answers Ahmadinejad's administration has provided so far have failed to satisfy them. Article 88 of the Iranian Constitution stipulates that the president must appear before the Parliament within a month of being summoned, unless lawmakers decide to withdraw the motion, according to the state-run Press TV. Deputy Speaker Mohammad Reza Bahonar said Tuesday that lawmakers hoped Ahmadinejad would appear by mid-March. Ahmadinejad has been in office since 2005. He was re-elected in 2009 amid widespread demonstrations by the opposition. Khamenei backed Ahmadinejad through the tumult that followed the election, including a crackdown on protesters, during which security forces were unleashed on crowds and activists were prosecuted and jailed. Khamenei, a former president, became the supreme leader of Iran in 1989 after the death of Ayatollah Khomeini.

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- Residents of the Venezuelan capital on Monday began to experience water rationing as part of a government preservation measure during a drought. The rolling cuts to water service will affect the capital of Caracas and some nearby areas for periods of up to 48 hours, the state-owned water utility Hidrocapital announced. The rationing will continue through the first quarter of 2010, the government said. President Hugo Chavez has urged citizens to take extra steps to reduce water use, including a suggestion last week that taking a shower should take only three minutes. The government says that weather phenomena are behind the drought, while critics of Chavez say that years of lack of infrastructure investment and planning left the country flat-footed when it came to offsetting the drought. Drought conditions have reduced reservoir volume to critical levels, officials say. The level of the Camatagua Reservoir, which supplies Caracas with about half of its water, has been on a downward trend since 2007, according to data from Hidrocapital. However, it's not as low as during the early 2000s. Some water-rationing measures were taken at the time, too, according to Hidrocapital. In Miranda State, which sits adjacent the capital, the Lagartijo Reservoir is at the lowest level ever recorded. ""There will be programmed interruptions in service, with the goal of recuperating the levels of the principal reservoirs that flow to the city and that were affected by the scarce rains this year,"" Hidrocapital President Alejandro Hitcher said at a news conference announcing the rationing. Even schools will have to deal with the water shortages, the government said. Only hospitals will be equipped with water around the clock. Critics, including the municipal agency that distributes Hidrocapital's water to the city, say that poor infrastructure has made it difficult for water pressure to reach some of the poorest parts of the city, according to local reports. The government says that the El Nino phenomenon -- unusually warm waters in the equatorial Pacific that affects weather around the globe -- is behind the dry conditions. Venezuela's National Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology also pointed a finger at something called quasi-biennial oscillation, which affects winds in the stratosphere. ""This other phenomenon,"" the institute said in a statement, ""has a relationship with the rains, and is capable of modifying or changing the magnitude and impacts of the effects that El Nino has brought."" Journalist Maria Carolina Gonzalez contributed to this report for CNN.","Rolling cuts to water service will affect Caracas, nearby areas for up to 48 hours .

"(CNN) -- Thursday's Supreme Court ruling upholding President Barack Obama's signature health care legislation effectively cements the cornerstone of his political legacy, observers said. ""This would be in the first paragraph of Barack Obama's summation of his presidency,"" said University of Minnesota professor Lawrence Jacobs, co-author of a 2010 book on the politics of health care. Obama: Ruling on health care a victory for all Americans . ""I cannot think of a policy by a Democrat or Republican that's going to have the kind of long-lasting impact on the lives of Americans in at least half a century, maybe going back to the New Deal,"" Jacobs said after Thursday's ruling. In a long-anticipated ruling, the court upheld the individual insurance mandate at the heart of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often called ""Obamacare."" The 5-4 ruling allows the government to move ahead with implementing the legislation, some key provisions of which won't take effect until 2014. And it advances a goal of universal health care that has eluded presidents dating back to Theodore Roosevelt, historian Doris Kearns Goodwin said. ""That this has finally gotten through the Supreme Court is the very historic accomplishment that all presidents wish for when they come into office,"" Goodwin said. Ruling plays into campaign narrative for both sides . That titanic clash over health care began shortly after Obama took office in 2009, pledging to expand health coverage to the roughly 45 million Americans without it. It dominated Congress for nearly a year before he signed the bill in March 2010. Conservatives complained that it would bust the federal budget and lead to worse health care, not better. Many liberals, meanwhile, wanted Obama to fight for a Canadian-style model or at least establish a public health insurance plan to compete with private companies. Opponents railed against the bill for a variety of sins real and imagined, including a later-dropped ""Cornhusker kickback"" aimed at securing support from Nebraska Democratic Sen. Ben Nelson and the false claims of ""death panels"" by critics such as ex-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who argued that the bill would lead to patients being denied critical care. Lawmakers found themselves facing angry crowds at usually sleepy meetings with constituents during their summer recess. Breaking down the court's decision . In the end, it passed over near-universal Republican opposition -- the sole GOP vote for it in either chamber was Rep. Joseph Cao of Louisiana -- with nearly three dozen Democrats voting against it as well. The battle fueled the rise of the conservative tea party movement and contributed to a sweeping Republican win in the 2010 congressional elections. One of the politicians elected in that wave, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, called Thursday's decision ""a loss for America."" The Supreme Court's finding that the individual mandate amounts to a tax will give taxpayers more headaches in April, Rubio predicted. ""This has now turned the IRS into an enforcement mechanism for Obamacare,"" he said. How the justices voted, what they wrote . Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, urged followers to rally and ""restore the Constitution to its rightful place."" The group is a leading voice for religious conservatives and filed a friend-of-the-court brief attacking the law. ""Not only is the individual mandate a profound attack on our liberties, but it is only one section among hundreds of provisions in the law that will force taxpayers to fund abortions, violate their conscience rights and impose a massive tax and debt burden on American families,"" Perkins said.

"London, England (CNN) -- Union members representing British Airways cabin crews said Monday they have voted overwhelmingly to strike, though no date was announced. The industrial action by the Unite union is over the airline's plans to change cabin crew conditions. Unite said then that working hours were to be extended and crew levels cut, changes that it said would damage customer service and hit the BA brand. In all, 81 percent of the nearly 80 percent of Unite workers who turned out voted in favor of the plan, the union said Monday. A Unite representative told reporters the vote was an ""indication of deep sense of grievance that our members feel"" and shows that the airline must resolve this ""through negotiation and not through litigation and certainly not through intimidation."" Shop stewards are to meet Tuesday to consider a strike date. British Airways said in a posting on its Web site that it regretted the strike announcement. ""The outcome of the ballot is very disappointing and brings a renewed threat of industrial action, which is completely unjustified,"" the airline said. ""In the weeks before and during the ballot period, Unite claimed that we had breached individual crew members' contracts by making modest changes to onboard crew numbers on flights from Heathrow. We have always said this claim was false, and it was rejected by the High Court three days ago. ""The vast majority of crew who voted in this ballot will have done so before the High Court decision. We hope Unite will bear this fact in mind as it considers its next steps."" The airline said it believed it had made progress in recent talks and said it wanted to resolve the issues. ""However, we will not allow Unite to ruin this company,"" it added. ""Should a strike take place, we will do everything we can to protect your travel plans as far as possible."" Last December, a judge blocked a planned 12-day strike by Unite that was to have begun just before Christmas. The airline, which lost hundreds of millions of dollars last year, has said the changes would save the carrier $665 million.","Union members representing BA cabin crews vote overwhelmingly to strike .

"Below is a commentary from Glenn Beck, who anchors ""Glenn Beck"" on Headline News nightly at 7pm and 9pm ET. NEW YORK -- Over the holidays I decided to have some minor surgery that I'd been putting off for a while. I intended to keep the whole thing private (you'll read why in a minute) and I planned to be back at work just in time for the Iowa caucuses. Well, as the saying goes: ""We plan, God laughs;"" and I guarantee He's still laughing over what happened to me next. After his painful expereince following surgery, Glenn Beck says care is the key to fixing the health care system. My ""routine"" outpatient surgery (which was on my butt -- get all your sophomoric jokes out of the way now) went awry and I was in terrible, excruciating pain. To help, my doctors  who were absolutely fantastic, created a sinister cocktail of pain medications so strong that it's usually reserved only for Hollywood starlets. It included morphine, Percocet, Toradol, some sort of synthetic morphine derivative on a pump, and my personal favorite -- Fentanyl, which my doctor told me is an opiate 80 times more powerful than morphine. That combination took me to an incredibly dark place. I began having trouble breathing, and I started to hallucinate. Every time I closed my eyes it was like I entered my very own movie theater running the movie ""Saw"" on a loop. I would see horrific, unimaginable images of death and after two and a half days, the combination of pain and hallucinations drove me to a point where I was literally suicidal. It felt like there was no hope and, quite honestly, if I could have ended it all right at that moment I probably would have (Sorry to disappoint some of you). After five days in and out of the hospital, and still delirious from pain medications, I had the bright idea to post a video on glennbeck.com describing some of what I was going through. Next thing I knew, the video was picked up by the Drudge Report, posted on the front page of AOL.com, and now over 600,000 people have seen it. Glenn Beck speaks from the bed Â» . But despite the embarrassment, I'm actually glad that the whole episode went public because it's given me a chance to talk about what I believe is the real problem with American healthcare: compassion, or more accurately, a lack of it. At the hospital I was often treated more like a number than a patient. At times, staff members literally turned their back on my cries of pain and pleas for help. In one case a nurse even stood by tapping his fingers as if he was bored while my tiny wife struggled to lift me off a waiting room couch. I've now seen our system at its very best and I've also experienced it at its very worst. But in each case, the difference had nothing to do with whether the hospital had the latest equipment or whether it looked like the Taj Mahal. It had to do with compassion. It had to do with respect. It had to do with treating people the way you'd want to be treated when going through something unfamiliar and frightening. That's why I don't want to hear anymore about universal health care or HMOs or the evils of insurance companies until each and every hospital in this country can look me in the eye and tell me that they their staff is full of truly compassionate people who treat their visitors like patients, not products. Hire and train the right people, and then and only then come talk to me about everything else you need. Our politicians are right; we do have a health care crisis in this country. But it's not going to be fixed by them, it's not going to be fixed by some government agency, and it's certainly not going to be fixed by throwing more money around. No, if you really want to fix our healthcare system then look no further than the word ""healthcare"" itself because the secret is right there. The secret is ""care."" After all, at the lowest of my lows, it didn't matter to me whether the hospital had marble in its bathrooms or plasma televisions on all its walls. The only thing I cared about was finding someone who actually cared about me.

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- A political showdown now looms in Lebanon after a potential kingmaker threw his allegiance Friday behind the opposition Hezbollah. Druze leader Walid Jumblatt said his support lies with Syria and those who oppose a United Nations-backed tribunal's investigation of the assassination of a former prime minister. ""I'm assuring that the party will remain persistently on the side of Syria and the resistance,"" Jumblatt said in a televised news conference Friday. Hezbollah's military wing is often referred to as a resistance movement in the Muslim world. 'Kingmaker' holds the key . ""Hopefully, the democratic game will move away from the tensions and the sectarian alliances, and we should stay open for dialogue, despite the schism that has happened and will continue to happen,"" said Jumblatt, who heads the Progressive Socialist Party. Members of Hezbollah forced the collapse of Lebanon's Western-backed government last week because of now-caretaker Prime Minister Saad Hariri's continued cooperation with the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. It is widely expected that the tribunal will indict members of the militant Shiite Muslim group for the 2005 killing of Hariri's father, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. The tribunal has scheduled a hearing for February 7 but it is unrelated to the indictment, said spokesman Crispin Thorold. A judge is currently reviewing the prosecutor's probe results, a process that could take up to 10 weeks. After the government collapsed, Lebanese President Michel Suleiman asked Saad Hariri to stay on as caretaker prime minister. Suleiman will begin speaking with members of parliament Monday to see who they want to be prime minister. The system of power-sharing that prevails in Lebanon mandates that the prime minister's office be reserved for a Sunni Muslim. The president is a Maronite Christian and the speaker of parliament is a Shiite Muslim. Jumblatt's announcement Friday was key, just days ahead of the key talks with Suleiman. In the past, Jumblatt has supported the tribunal, and his 11-member parliamentary bloc was officially part of Hariri's March 14 alliance. But recently, Jumblatt has become increasingly neutral, and now, he could play a decisive role in deciding who will be Lebanon's next prime minister, given the small majority that Hariri's alliance retains in the 128-seat parliament. ""The course of the tribunal has shifted to become a tool of destruction and has gone off the course of justice to enter the political bazaar and the blackmail market,"" Jumblatt said. Hariri said Thursday he intends to regain his post. That announcement came after a flurry of mediation efforts by regional powers fizzled. If Lebanon's crisis cannot be settled, fears are that the Middle Eastern nation -- no stranger to sectarian strife -- could see more bloodshed. ""There is total mistrust between the parties and this is why a compromise is necessary,"" Jumblatt told CNN. He said he was ""obliged"" to take a side after ""forces of darkness"" obstructed regional efforts to resolve the tribunal dispute and Lebanon's political crisis. But, he said, ""even if I side, I will do my best to find out a compromise."" CNN's Nada Husseini, Nic Robertson and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.","Walid Jumblatt could play a decisive role in choosing the next prime minister .

"(CNN) -- A silver cup presented to the Greek winner of the marathon at the first modern Olympics in Athens in 1896 has sold for a record Â£541,000 ($860,000) at auction in London. It is the highest price paid for a piece of Olympic memorabilia, with the sale at Christie's over in a matter of minutes with the bids leaping Â£50,000 ($80,000) at a time. The previous record was for an Olympic torch from the 1952 Helsinki Games in Finland which fetched $400,000 last year. Spyros Louis became a national hero when he won the only gold medal for Greece in the track and field events 116 years ago so it became a matter of national pride that the cup should return to the birthplace of the Olympics. CNN understands that the Mayor of the Marousi District in Athens, where Louis was born, raised 350,000 euros ($458,000 ) to bid. It wasn't enough. The new owner is the Greek philanthropic organization, the Stavros Niarchos Foundation, named after the late Greek shipping tycoon. The cup will go on display in Athens and will eventually be given a permanent home in the Foundation's new cultural center due to open in 2015. Symbolic value . The cup which fetched such a vast sum is just 15 centimeters high but beautifully decorated in the art nouveau style. Its intrinsic value -- as silver -- isn't very high. But this cup is all about symbolism, an object from the beginning of the modern Olympics. The story of the cup involved three men. Spyros Louis, his grandson and a Frenchman, Michel Breal. Louis had helped salvage Greek pride in the most emblematic of races for the host country. The odds were certainly stacked in their favor. Of the 17 runners, 13 were Greek. But going into the last few miles of the race, an Australian and a French athlete were leading and an expectant crowd waiting in the stadium were subdued. Then suddenly word reached the stadium that the foreigners had both dropped out and a Greek was leading. Spyros Louis wasn't considered a favorite and had only finished fifth in a special trial race before the Games, but he proved to have stamina. By trade, he moved water by mule into the center of Athens and it stood him in good stead. Greek hero . By winning the marathon (then 25 miles) he instantly became a Greek sporting immortal. Even now in Greece, over 70 years after his death, his name remains a synonym for moving at speed. The 2004 Olympic Stadium is named after him. The King of Greece presided over the award ceremony on the last day of the Games. Spyros Louis received a silver medal, a crown of olive leaves, a diploma and, of course, the special silver cup. And this is where Michel Breal enters the story. He was a distinguished linguist (usually credited as the founder of modern semantics) and passionate about all things Greek. He was crucial in persuading his fellow Frenchman, Baron de Coubertin to include the marathon in the first Games. As an incentive, Breal provided the special cup for the winner, Breal's Silver Cup as it became known. It is unclear who designed it, but the relief decoration shows bird and plant life from the ancient battleground of Marathon. So the legend has it, in 490 B.C., the messenger, Phidippides ran from Marathon to Athens to bring news of the Greek victory over the Persians, then collapsed and died. Until now, the cup has always been in the Louis family. During the Second World War, it was apparently hidden in a tomato patch in a garden, but more recently it has had pride of place on the mantelpiece in the house of the great athlete's grandson, also called Spyros Louis, a retired civil servant in his early 70s. Reluctant sale . He agonized for some time, but in these tough economic times in Greece, he reluctantly decided to sell it, to provide for his two children. Two years ago, he did the rounds of various government ministries, offering to sell the cup for a mere 100,000 euros ($130,000) but without response. The Greek Culture Ministry didn't seem to have any reservations about granting it an export license and this has ultimately proved to the financial benefit of the Louis family. Michel Breal's great grand daughter, Katharine Brunt, aged 88, attended the Christie's sale. And just before it started, wearing white gloves, she was able to briefly hold the legendary Silver Cup her great grandfather commissioned. It was a touching moment; she had never even seen the cup before. Katharine Brunt has a mission; The Silver Cup may be going back to Greece for museum display, but Michel Breal's tombstone in Montparnasse cemetery in Paris badly needs restoration. Apparently the authorities are threatening to demolish it. On grounds of neglect. There's evidently a big crack down the middle and $6000 is needed. Mrs Brunt is hoping that the newly-enriched Spyros Louis may able to help.","A silver cup presented at the first modern Olympic Games has sold for Â£541,000 .

"(CNN) -- I am a journalist. I am a teacher. I am a black woman. I am a witness to prejudice. I've experienced it firsthand: Random strangers have called me ""n----r"" on a busy street in Indiana and in Dallas, Texas. So, I know the specter of hate when I see it. Now it is hovering over Tulsa, Oklahoma, where police say Jake England and Alvin Watts confessed to shooting five people on April 6, snuffing out the lives of three and wounding two others. The two have pleaded not guilty. This is a crime filled with hate, most certainly, but is this a hate crime? It took seven days for Tulsa County prosecutors to answer: Yes to charges of first-degree murder, with shooting with intent to kill and with malicious intimidation or harassment -- Oklahoma's equivalent of a hate crime. For many black people in Tulsa, it was a welcome bookend to what was a very angry week. Here's what had been reported: Watts is white, and England has been identified as white and, in some reports, as Native American. All the victims that morning were black, and England's father, Carl, was killed by a black man in a shooting tied to an attempted home invasion in 2010. England's Facebook postings about his father's death have fueled much of the speculation. Jake England is reported to have used a racial slur on his Facebook page, and then wrote, ""It's hard not to go off."" The killings took place on Good Friday, and the men quickly were arrested on Easter Sunday. But as of midweek, many wondered why officials hadn't called the shooting spree a hate crime. You know what they say: If it looks like a hate crime and smells like a hate crime ... There is a lot we don't know about this crime. England is recorded in a video released by his lawyer saying he does not hate blacks and that he counts many black people among his friends. Some allegations say that England knew one of the victims. If that is true, how random were the shootings? Still, many others say the actions of choosing the people by their race clearly make it a hate crime. Residents in the mostly black neighborhood in north Tulsa, where the shootings happened, and many officials in Oklahoma are convinced the charge is correct. In a recent media conference call with several black officials and ministers, state Sen. Constance Johnson, chairwoman of the Oklahoma Black Caucus, said she was concerned about crimes against blacks and requested that the federal government get involved in the investigation to send a message. ""This is a powder keg waiting to explode,"" she said. Gwendolyn Fields agrees. Fields is executive director of the Advocacy Council, a group described as fighting for criminal justice reform in Oklahoma. She paraphrased the state's intimidation statute: ""A hate crime occurs when a person targets a person because of his or her (inclusion) in a group."" She added that the Advocacy Council talked to Tulsa police officials to express its concern. Both Johnson and Fields said they are worried that such crimes are increasing, citing the killing of Trayvon Martin in Florida and crimes against black people in Oklahoma during the past five years -- perhaps the most grisly being the unsolved killing of the Rev. Carol Daniels in Anadarko, whose mutilated body was found in a church. Johnson said these crimes are indicative of ""a pattern of attacks on blacks here, not unlike the old South."" Tulsa has a tortured history. In 1921, after a black man was accused of molesting a white woman, a mob destroyed Tulsa's famous black business district. Greenwood burned. Hundreds died in the riots. After years of forgotten history, the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921 published its findings in 2001, referring to Tulsa's ""emotional and physical scars of this terrible incident in our shared past."" So, nearly 100 years after what clearly was a hate crime, religious leaders quickly met with Tulsa's black community to discuss what's been labeled another one. I asked a colleague who lives in Tulsa for her opinion. Hate crime for sure, she said, but her reason was as eloquent and convincing as any I've heard: ""People are targets just because of who they are, not what they're doing or involved in. Therefore, until these suspects were caught, every black person in north Tulsa could logically fear that he or she could be shot."" Now that the crime is officially labeled hate, people seem to feel justified. But another question lingers, as it does in the Trayvon Martin case: What does it matter if it's officially called hate if the shooters are convicted of murder? For 48 long hours beginning on Good Friday, Tulsa's citizens felt that pain of bigotry, that sting of prejudice, that ache of fear. That's enough to end the national debate and get on with it. Bring justice for these five Oklahoma families. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Yvette Walker.","Three black people were killed, two wounded in a shooting spree in Tulsa, Oklahoma .

"(CNN) -- A secretly taped video by a male and a female posing as sex traffickers purportedly shows a Planned Parenthood employee in New Jersey telling them how to secure abortions and contraception for underage girls, anti-abortion activist Lila Rose told CNN Wednesday. In response, Planned Parenthood described the January 13 video by Rose's anti-abortion group Live Action as a scheme to ""take down"" the abortion-rights organization, Planned Parenthood spokesman Stuart Schear said in a statement. In a CNN interview, Schear added Planned Parenthood has already reported the claims of sex trafficking to federal authorities and on Tuesday fired the videotaped employee. Planned Parenthood of Central New Jersey also condemned the apparent misconduct of the employee. ""The behavior of our employee, as portrayed on the video, if accurate, violates PPCNJ policies, as well as our core values of protecting the welfare of minors and complying with the law,"" Phyllis Kinsler, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Central New Jersey, said in a statement. Last month, Live Action activists with secret cameras visited two Planned Parenthood health centers in New Jersey, where human trafficking has been a major issue, Schear said in a statement. After the visits were over, Planned Parenthood notified local authorities of alleged human trafficking and learned of at least 11 visits to facilities in six states over one week ""in which persons claiming to be involved in sex trafficking with minors asked for services for young women,"" according to Planned Parenthood statements. Planned Parenthood then notified federal authorities, and the FBI is reviewing photos of at least one person making the sex trafficking claims, Schear said. There was no immediate confirmation from the FBI that a review was underway. In the visits, men, sometimes accompanied by a woman, appear at Planned Parenthood without an appointment saying they were seeking health services, but they quickly turn the conversation to a supposed sex ring they claim to be managing, according to a Planned Parenthood statement. ""If a multistate sex trafficking operation is in place, those responsible must be pursued to stop the exploitation of girls and young women,"" Schear said in a statement. ""If these visits are part of a 'dirty tricks' campaign, they must be condemned. Falsely claiming sex trafficking to health professionals to advance a political agenda is an astoundingly cynical form of political activity."" Rose -- president of Los Angeles-based Live Action and, according to the organization's website, a student at UCLA -- said the video from January shows two individuals portraying a pimp and a prostitute. In the past 3 1/2 years, group members have gone ""undercover"" in a total of 11 Planned Parenthood clinics, she said. ""These are actors, and they investigate sexual abuse cover-up going on across the country institutionally at Planned Parenthood clinics,"" Rose told CNN. ""This is the 11th clinic where it shows the worker aiding and abetting who they think is a pimp, a sexual abuser who commercially exploits young girls."" In the CNN interview, Rose, 22, did not detail what happened in the 10 other visits. She said she participated in an unspecified number of the undercover visits. In the video, an female employee at Planned Parenthood's facility in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, advises the couple to have the underage girls lie about their age to avoid mandatory reporting laws for abortion. ""Even if they lie, just say, 'Oh, he's the same age as me, 15,'...it's just that mainly 14 and under we have to, doesn't matter if their partner's the same age, younger, whatever, 14 and under we have to report,"" the Planned Parenthood employee says in the video. The employee also tells the male that he can get cheaper contraception by claiming the girls are ""students,"" according to the video. ""If they're minors, put down that they're students. Yeah, just kind of play along that they're students. We want to make it look as legit as possible,"" the Planned Parenthood employee says on the video. The employee cites another abortion provider to the couple in case an underage girl needs an abortion, according to the video. ""Their protocols aren't as strict as ours, and they don't get audited the same way that we do,"" the Planned Parenthood employee says on the video about the other abortion provider. Live Action said it sent the entire video to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, New Jersey Attorney General Paula Dow, the FBI and other law enforcement officials. CNN could not immediately verify that claim. ""This proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Planned Parenthood intentionally breaks state and federal laws and covers up the abuse of the young girls it claims to serve,"" Rose said in a statement. Rose pointed out to CNN that Planned Parenthood receives federal funding and added: ""These clinics need to be defunded. Young girls are at risk."" Planned Parenthood spokesman Schear said the video posted on the Live Action website was edited and was shot with a secret camera by Live Action activists on January 13. ""The group that has undertaken this secret taping is on the record as saying its goal is to 'take down' Planned Parenthood over the next 10 years by creating 'controversy' in the organization and making Planned Parenthood 'not feel safe,'"" Schear said in a statement. In an interview with CNN, Schear added that the videotaped employee's immediate firing ""is as clear a message you can deliver"" that Planned Parenthood has ""zero tolerance"" for misconduct. ""Live Action is an extreme political group and their goal is to take away health care from women, to end abortion in the United States,"" Schear said. ""There is no training that can prevent this from happening. This is a complete breakdown in judgment: we don't know understand what happened with this employee."" A statement on the Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood website said that ""these secret video tapings of our health centers are being coordinated with anti-choice groups who are pressing for the passage of the federal Pence bill to defund Planned Parenthood. ""This bill would deny federal funds for family planning and preventive care to Planned Parenthood, the largest provider of reproductive health care to women in the United States,"" the statement by Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood in New York state said.","The anti-abortion group Live Action secretly taped a video at a Planned Parenthood facility .

"(CNN) -- A man who survived the April 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech says not enough is being done to keep guns out of the hands of people like the shooter even as a jury found the university failed to warn students earlier that a gunman was on campus. ""As someone who lost a teacher and many friends as a result of the Virginia Tech massacre, I am gratified by the verdict,"" said Colin Goddard, who was shot four times during the rampage by Seung-Hui Cho. A jury Wednesday awarded $4 million to the families of Erin Peterson and Julia Pryde after finding the university should have notified the student body earlier after discovering two people had been found shot to death in a dormitory room on the morning of April 16. Cho went on to kill 30 more people at Norris Hall, home to the university's Engineering Science and Mechanics Department, after chaining the doors closed. He also wounded 17 people, including Goddard, before killing himself. Two years before the shooting rampage, a judge deemed Cho a danger to himself due to mental illness, which should have disqualified him from buying a handgun under federal law. ""We have Congressional representatives and many state legislators who have failed since Virginia Tech to keep the mentally ill and other dangerous people from easy access to guns,"" Goddard said. In the aftermath of the shooting, Goddard went to work as a gun control advocate, calling for among other things stronger measures that keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill. ""It's outrageous that in America people sell guns without background checks and with no questions asked."" Cho's mental health status should have been noted in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, a database of people disqualified from gun purchases. But, in Cho's case, his mental status never went in the system. The reason: The federal government relied on Virginia to provide the information, and Virginia law disqualifies someone from buying firearms only if he has been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital. Cho was ordered to undergo outpatient treatment, but he was never committed. Cho bought one of the guns he used in the massacre online from an out-of-state dealer, picking it up after background checks were complete from a Blacksburg, Va., pawn shop. He bought his other pistol from a Roanoke gun dealer a month before the shooting.","Colin Goddard was one of 17 people wounded in the shooting rampage .

"(CNN) -- A bus explosion that killed one and injured dozens in Kenya was caused by a man believed to have ties to a militant group, authorities said Wednesday. The grenade attack Monday injured at least 40 people in a Uganda-bound bus, Kenyan police spokesman Eric Kiraithe said. It left blood stains and luggage scattered at the site of the attack in Nairobi's central business district. Most of the injured were Ugandans headed home for the holidays, the spokesman said. He said the suspect, a 35-year-old Tanzanian, was the only fatality in the attack. It was unclear whether he had accomplices. ""Police suspected him because he was quite nervous and resisted attempts to have his luggage examined,"" Kiraithe said. After an altercation with the police, the suspect dropped his bag, which exploded. ""We have strong reasons to believe there's a link between him and Al-Shabaab,"" Kiraithe said. He declined to comment on any evidence linking the suspect to the militant group that has been battling Somalia's transitional government for years. The group, considered the al Qaeda proxy in Somalia, has previously threatened attacks on Uganda and Burundi. The two countries contribute troops to the peacekeeping effort in Somalia. Kiraithe said it is ""logical to believe he targeted the bus because it would have Ugandans."" The bus was bound for Uganda's capital, Kampala. The nation's authorities had warned of holiday terror attacks by the Islamist group hours before the blast. Kenya and Uganda have boosted security along their borders. ""We are investigating the crime together with Ugandan authorities,"" the spokesman said. ""This is a busy travel period so we're also adding more security and taking all measures to make sure it's safe.""

"New York (CNN) -- A year after police discovered four bodies dumped along a remote stretch of New York beach, authorities said Tuesday they believe they've found the body of a missing New Jersey woman whose disappearance triggered the search. ""If it is Shannan Gilbert, then her location is indicative of her trying to make it to the causeway,"" situated northeast of where the remains were ultimately found, said Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer. The suspected skeletal remains of Gilbert, 24, were uncovered in a remote marshland on Long Island's Oak Beach. Her disappearance in May 2010 prompted a search that has since unearthed 10 sets of human remains strewn across two Long Island counties, leading to national headlines and a hunt for a possible serial killer. A medical examiner is expected to determine whether the remains belong to the Jersey City, New Jersey, resident, whose death authorities have previously said is not likely attributed to the suspected killer. Police cut through a thicket of brush and bramble this week, expanding their search across swampland before uncovering Gilbert's suspected remains. ""The terrain would have made it impossible for her to get to"" Ocean Parkway, Dormer told reporters. Homicide detectives spotted the bones at 9:14 a.m. Tuesday while riding atop ""an amphibious machine"" after having drained nearby areas last week in an effort to improve access and visibility. The remains were discovered about a quarter mile away from Gilbert's pocketbook, which was found last week alongside a cell phone, shoes and a pair of jeans. ""It is certainly a sad day for the Gilbert family,"" Dormer added. After Gilbert vanished last year, the search for her led police seven months later to four bodies found along a quarter-mile stretch of Oak Beach. Additional remains were uncovered in subsequent months at neighboring Gilgo Beach and along beachfront property in Nassau County, about 40 miles east of New York City. Like the four victims found last December, Gilbert had advertised prostitution services on websites such as Craigslist. Gilbert's sisters have said the missing woman was an escort who was visiting a client. They said she ran from the man's house in a panic, saying someone was trying to hurt her. A man who lives a few miles from where the first set of remains were found told CNN that a young woman who ""looked like she was partying all night"" came to his door around 5 a.m. on May 1, 2010. ""She was screaming, 'Help me, help me!' and said somebody was chasing her,"" said resident Gustav Coletti, who called police. The woman then ran off, he said, just before a man drove up in a dark-colored sport utility vehicle and inquired of her whereabouts. ""This may be just a young lady (who) ran into the brush in hysterical state, fell down and expired for some reason,"" Dormer said Wednesday. The police commissioner last week announced that the investigation into the other bodies now is concentrated on the possibility of a single serial killer -- a departure from his earlier statements in which he said the bodies could be the work of one or more killers. It is unclear what prompted the change in focus toward one killer.","The remains are found a quarter mile from belongings found last week, police say .

"(CNN) -- Colombia's largest rebel group reportedly claimed on Tuesday to be holding French journalist Romeo Langlois, who disappeared over the weekend, and described him as a ""prisoner of war."" A woman claiming to belong to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, also known as FARC, called a group of local journalists and read a statement she attributed to the group. ""The French journalist, dressed as a soldier and captured during battle, is in our hands and is a prisoner of war. He has a slight arm wound, for which he received medical attention, and is out of danger,"" she said. The statement was reported by various media groups in Colombia, including the El Tiempo newspaper and Caracol Radio. Colombia's president has demanded the release of Langlois, who was kidnapped by FARC while on a military raid of drug laboratories. ""We want to tell the FARC to release him as soon as possible,"" said President Juan Manuel Santos. ""Among other things, because we understand he is hurt."" Colombian Air Force helicopter crashes, killing 13 . Colombian Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon said on Sunday that preliminary reports indicated that Langlois was shot in his arm before he disappeared. In April, FARC pledged to stop kidnappings civilians for money. Langlois, who works for France 24 and is a war reporter with more than 10 years experience in the country, was reporting alongside soldiers when the rebel group attacked, the Colombia government said. A sergeant, two soldiers and a national police officer were killed, the Ministry of National Defense said; six others were injured. The attack took place in the southern Caqueta province as soldiers worked to destroy cocaine labs. On Monday, the Colombian air force released a video taken in the same Caqueta region that purportedly showed rebels dressed as civilians shooting at military aircraft. Air Force Commander Tito Saul Pinilla said Colombia will take the video to international bodies, which he didn't specify, as evidence that FARC is in violation of the Geneva Convention. ""The video proves that again (the rebels are using) the civilian population as a shield to commit their criminal acts,"" Pinilla said. ""This causes great difficulty not only to our ground forces but also to our pilots who have to try to locate an enemy that is in plain clothes, white shirts and who runs and hides among the civilian population."" France 24 reported its editors were working with authorities in Colombia and France to gather information on the journalist. ""We know that it's a difficult region,"" said Nahida Nakad, editorial director of Audiovisuel Exterieur de la France, of which France 24 is a part, the television network reported. ""Of course we are very worried, but we have every confidence in Romeo, who knows the territory very well and is an experienced journalist. We hope that he is safe and sound, and we are in constant contact with his family."" A FARC-sympathetic news agency that often publishes official statements from the group blamed the incident on the Colombian government. Langlois' disappearance ""is the responsibility of the government of Colombia for engaging in their ranks a foreign national as a correspondent of war,"" said an editorial posted by the New Colombia News Agency. The rebel group has been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s, and has used kidnapping forces and civilians as a key strategy. Video: Hostages held more than a decade released .

"Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- Ugandan police announced Thursday the arrest of a 22-year-old man who they say confessed to killing gay rights activist David Kato. In a news conference at which suspect Enock Nsubuga was presented to the media, authorities said he admitted using a hammer to bludgeon Kato to death. Nsubuga was taken into custody Wednesday afternoon, though police said they'd been tracking him for several days. The head of Uganda's national police, Kale Kayihura, said Thursday in the capital, Kampala, that Nsubuga was an ex-convict who had been working in Kato's garden at the time of the activist's death. After being detained, Nsubuga admitted to killing Kato and explained why he did so, according to Kayihura. According to the suspect, Kato, 46, promised to pay Nsubuga money for having sex with him. But Kato never followed through. An angered Nsubuga told police that he then took a hammer from the bathroom and fatally beat Kato. Kayihura said he believes the attack was not a hate crime, as has been widely reported, but rather stemmed primarily from Nsubuga's desire to get money from Kato. The police chief denounced elements within the public, as well as the media, for reports that he claimed had fueled aggression against Uganda's homosexual community. He specifically mentioned a report from Rolling Stone -- a Ugandan tabloid that is not affiliated with the iconic U.S. music magazine by the same name -- that published a list late last year of the African nation's ""top 100 homosexuals"" with their photos, addresses and a banner with the words ""Hang Them."" Kato's name and picture were on the list. According to Kato's lawyer, the activist had feared for his safety prior to his death, even alerting police about his concerns. Late last week, human rights activist Naomi Ruzindana said she did not believe the killing was a robbery gone wrong. ""I don't think it's a coincidence that it happened ... he had got threats over and again,"" she said. Nsubuga had a long criminal history, including being jailed recently for stealing a cell phone, police said. According to neighbors, Nsubuga was last seen leaving the activist's house on Tuesday of last week. Kato was found dead the following day. Chaos ensued at his funeral last Friday, after a pastor rebuked homosexuals at the service in Mukono, a small hillside village outside the capital. Mourners took away the man's microphone and police whisked him away from the angry crowds. A sympathetic Anglican bishop stepped in to finish the ceremony. Homosexuality is illegal in most countries in Africa, where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism. In Uganda, homosexual acts are punishable by 14 years to life in prison, according to rights activists. Ugandan lawmakers shelved a controversial ""anti-gay"" proposal introduced in 2009 that would impose tough penalties against homosexuality, including life imprisonment and the death penalty. Even with Nsubuga's arrest and alleged confession, as well as the earlier detainment of Kato's driver, the police chief said Thursday that the murder investigation is continuing.","Murder suspect Enock Nsubuga was arrested Wednesday .

"Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- A top Ugandan opposition leader was arrested again Thursday during a ""walk to work"" campaign to protest rising food prices and increased cost of living. Kizza Besigye was detained a day after he was freed on bail following another arrest. He spent the Easter holiday in detention. Besigye has vowed to ""walk to work"" to protest every Monday and Thursday, contending the government is manipulating prices of fuel and other commodities. He has been arrested a number of times this month. During his latest arrest Thursday, men in civilian clothing smashed his car and pepper-sprayed him. He was then loaded in a police car. President Yoweri Museveni has warned that anyone taking part in the walk is breaking the law and will be prosecuted. The leader of the Forum for Democratic Change lost a February election to Museveni. The incumbent has led the east African nation for 25 years. Besigye, a former doctor to Museveni, lost previous presidential bids in 2001 and 2006.","He has been arrested a number of times this year .

"(CNN) -- An American human rights group documenting widespread sexual violence against Darfuri women in Sudan and Chad has called for ""vigorous prosecution of rape as a war crime."" Sudanese women in a refugee camp in southern Chad in March. Physicians for Human Rights, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, issued a report Sunday ""documenting the scope and long-term impact of rape and other sexual violence"" experienced by women who fled the war-torn Sudanese region of Darfur and now live as refugees in neighboring Chad. The report -- titled ""Nowhere To Turn: Failure To Protect, Support and Assure Justice for Darfuri Women"" -- is based on interviews with 88 female refugees living in Chad's Farchana refugee camp. The study was done with the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative. ""Many Darfuri women refugees live in a nightmare of memories of past trauma compounded by the constant threat of sexual violence around the camps now,"" said Susannah Sirkin, the physician group's deputy director. ""Women who report being raped are stigmatized, and remain trapped in places of perpetual insecurity. There's no one to stop the rapes, no one to turn to for justice for past or ongoing crimes, and little psycho-social support to address their prolonged and unimaginable traumas."" Dr. Sondra Crosby, a Physicians for Human Rights consultant and expert in refugee trauma, said ""the atmosphere of intimidation was palpable as we listened to women describing their profound suffering and fear, and their yearning to return safely and with dignity to their former lives."" Of those refugees interviewed, ""32 reported instances of confirmed or highly probable rape"" -- 17 in Darfur and 15 in Chad, the group said. ""Among the instances of rape reported in Chad, the vast majority (10 of 11 confirmed reports) occurred when women left the camps to gather firewood."" And just over half of the 88 women interviewed -- 46 of them -- live in fear of sexual assaults around the refugee camp. The group supports the issuing of International Criminal Court warrants against the Sudanese perpetrators. The group also called for ""legal reforms in Chad to end impunity for sexual violence,"" and for ""effective psychosocial support to survivors."" And it said increased protections are needed by police and peacekeepers, including ""effective firewood patrols."" The conflict in Darfur began in 2003 after rebels in the western region of Sudan began attacking government positions. Sudan's government responded with a fierce military campaign that has led to some 200,000 deaths and forced 2 million people to flee their homes, according to the United Nations.","88 Darfuri women interviewed in Chad described ""profound"" suffering and fear .

"(CNN) -- A video camera mounted inside the police car of a Virginia Tech police officer slain Thursday showed a man with a weapon who appears to be same person as a man who was later found shot dead about a quarter of a mile away, a Virginia state police official said Thursday night. Maj. Rick Jenkins added that, at this point in this investigation, ""we cannot say definitively"" that the second victim had fired the shots that killed Officer Deriek W. Crouse. But the man does appear on video footage from moments before that officer was killed, and he also matches the description first put out by police of the suspect. In addition, Jenkins said authorities ""have recovered clothing items that lead us to believe that"" the second victim and the man on the video ""are one and the same."" The incident began about 12:15 p.m., when Crouse, a four-year Virginia Tech police veteran, pulled over someone during a routine traffic stop in the Cassell Coliseum parking lot near McComas Hall. The Cassell Coliseum at Virginia Tech houses athletic facilities. McComas Hall houses exercise facilities. Soon thereafter, police ""dispatch was unable to make contact with the officer,"" Virginia Tech Deputy Police Chief Gene Deisinger said. Then, before 12:30 p.m., police received their first call from a witness who said he'd seen the suspect -- who state police Sgt. Bob Carpentieri said authorities ""do not believe ... was in the vehicle that was stopped"" -- approach the officer's car and open fire. A few minutes later, at 12:36 p.m., the first of six alerts was issued to the campus community about the shooting. A visibly upset Julie Fleming described to CNN affiliate WDBJ how she'd been walking nearby and saw police pull up around the vehicle of the officer who had been shot. ""When they opened (the car door), he just fell out toward the ground, and they immediately started reviving him,"" she said, adding that two officers then took off with weapons after the gunman. Brian Walls, an employee in the school's athletic department, told CNN he also saw first-responders trying to resuscitate someone in the same area, which is also near the university's football stadium. The shooter had fled on foot toward a parking lot known as ""the Cage,"" school spokesman Mark Owczarski said. This suspect was ""described as white male, gray sweat pants, gray hat w/ neon green brim, maroon hoodie and backpack,"" Virginia Tech said in posts on its website and Twitter feed. About a quarter-mile from the first shooting, in what's described as the ""I-Lot,"" a law enforcement officer saw a suspicious man and tried to contact him, Virginia Tech Police Department Deputy Chief Gene Deisinger said. ""By the time they turned around and located the subject, that subject was deceased,"" the deputy chief said. Gov. Bob McDonnell said Thursday night that ""another gunshot"" had been heard between 15 to 30 minutes after the first shooting. The clothes tied to the initial suspect description were recovered later. Jenkins, though, did not state they were found on the second dead man, where he was found. While several updates were sent out, it wasn't until 4:30 p.m. that the school announced on its Twitter feed that ""law enforcement agencies have determined there is no longer an active threat or need to secure in place. Resume normal activities."" On Thursday afternoon, authorities similarly did not explicitly state that the second person shot dead had earlier killed the police officer. Carpentieri said only that ""investigators feel confident that they have located"" the officer's shooter. ""When the university lifted the alert, they consulted with several people and they felt that it was safe for students and faculty to go about their day,"" Carpentieri said. ""We like to think that things are safe."" Crouse, 39, joined the Virginia Tech police force six months after the 2007 mass shooting, according to a release on the school's website. A U.S. Army veteran who had worked at the New River Valley jail and with the Montgomery County Sheriff's Department, the Christiansburg resident is survived by his wife as well as five children and stepchildren. The second slain man has not been identified by name. And police also have not given a possible motive for the shootings. The Virginia State Police are taking the lead in the investigation, Deisinger said. Federal agents are involved as well, including six agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives who responded to the scene, ATF spokesman Scot Thomasson said. In addition to reviewing the video from Crouse's car, investigators are sorting through ballistic and DNA evidence and interviewing witnesses, said Jenkins of the state police . The episode rattled a campus where 33 people were killed on April 16, 2007, when student Seung-Hui Cho went on a shooting rampage. Two of those deaths occurred at West Ambler Johnston Hall, across the street from the Coliseum lot. ""In light of the turmoil and the trauma and the tragedy suffered by this campus by guns, I can only say that words don't describe our feelings and they are most elusive at this point in time,"" Virginia Tech President Charles Steger told reporters Thursday. On Thursday, law enforcement and school officials said the alert system put in place in recent years worked well, both from technological and communications standpoints. ""What I observed and experienced was significant cooperation from everybody I encountered,"" Deisinger said of what he saw, on campus, after the alerts went out. ""I think the community received the notification and responded to that, as we asked them to."" Kiersten Todt Coon, a risk management consultant who has worked with other universities on campus management, said it appears that accurate information was communicated quickly and methodically -- in contrast to what happened four years ago. That said, she said school administrators should now review whether that information got out to everyone who needed to get it. ""Did the messages work across the board?"" Coon asked rhetorically. One school administrator said he and other staffers locked rooms and laboratories in Shanks Hall within three minutes of getting the first alert around 12:36 p.m. In the subsequent hours, he said faculty and employees got ""regular and updated information"" that he described as ""very helpful"" and calming. ""We've practiced this over time,"" said Robert E. Denton Jr., head of Virginia Tech's department of communication, told CNN affiliate WSLS during the lockdown. ""This is kind of scary to go through ... It brings back so much."" McDonnell lauded the communications effort not just as governor, but also as a parent: His daughter is a Virginia Tech master's student who was confined to a basement classroom during the four-hour episode. ""Like so many parents who had children on the Virginia Tech campus, I felt a lot of that angst and uncertainty,"" he said. ""Again, I want to express my gratitude to law enforcement for making sure that they kept the faculty (and) parents regularly informed."" Classes for the semester ended Wednesday. Students were preparing Thursday for final exams for the fall semester, though the university announced on its website that Friday's exams had been postponed to Saturday. A small vigil was held Thursday night on the Blacksburg campus, and a similar event is scheduled for for 6:30 p.m. Friday, according to a posting on the student government association's Twitter account. Beyond Virginia Tech, Thursday's incident had ripple effects elsewhere in western Virginia. All public schools in Montgomery County -- where Blacksburg is located -- were also placed on lockdown, county school Superintendent Brenda Blackburn said. Dismissal eventually began at 3:30 p.m., after a delay of more than an hour. In addition, a western Virginia rest area along Interstate 81 was shut down Thursday afternoon, Virginia Department of Transportation spokesman Jason Bond said. The stop, on the highway's northbound side, is about nine miles from the Virginia Tech exit. He did not know whether that move -- which was ordered by state police -- was related to the Blacksburg shooting. Carpentieri noted there was ""some suspicious activity at that location,"" though he also declined to say whether it was related to the Virginia Tech incident. Several Virginia Tech administrators -- including the head of campus police, Wendell Flinchum, and the emergency management director, Michael Mulhare -- were in Washington on Thursday at a federal court hearing on the 2007 shooting on the school's campus, according to U.S. Department of Education officials. Flinchum and the school were criticized after that incident for not notifying students quickly enough that there was a danger on campus. The hearing was an appeal of the Department of Education's fine of $55,000 on Virginia Tech under the Clery Act, a federal law related to campus safety. In April, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli called the 2007 case against Virginia Tech ""Monday-morning quarterbacking at its very worst."" As to Thursday's incident, Carpentieri stressed that there were ""two crime scenes"" -- where the two bodies were found -- and that the probe is ongoing, with many questions still unanswered. At the same time, he voiced confidence that ""things are safe for people to be out again."" ""These are large crime scenes and it takes several hours to put the puzzle together,"" the state police sergeant said. ""We still don't have a lot of the puzzle pieces connected."" CNN's Carol Cratty, Phil Gast, Greg Botelho, Vivian Kuo, Eric Fiegel and Sally Holland contributed to this report.","NEW: A vigil is held at Virginia Tech on Thursday night; another is set for Friday .

"Washington (CNN) -- A divided Supreme Court ruled Wednesday against a California pilot who sued after the federal government publicly revealed his HIV status. In a 5-3 ruling, the high court decided Stanmore Cooper's claims of mental and emotional distress are not covered under the Privacy Act. ""The Privacy Act does not unequivocally authorize damages for mental or emotional distress and therefore does not waive the government's sovereign immunity for such harms,"" Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the conservative majority. Three liberal justices dissented, while a fourth, former Solicitor General Elena Kagan, did not participate. In a statement Wednesday, Cooper said it was ""discouraging that a majority of the court sided with the government."" Cooper became a licensed recreational pilot in 1964, but two decades later, the San Francisco man was diagnosed with HIV. As his condition worsened, he let his private pilot's certificate and his airman medical certificate lapse. In 1996, Cooper applied for long-term disability with the Social Security Administration. ""I was in bad shape, I didn't have long to live,"" he said last year. But his health improved thanks to a cocktail of anti-retroviral therapy. He went back to work and wanted to fly again. ""I found out they were issuing medicals (exemptions) and I reapplied"" to the Federal Aviation Administration ""without revealing my HIV status,"" he said. ""Big mistake."" He received his new pilot's certificate but, unknown to him, a joint local-federal initiative called Operation Safe Pilot was launched in 2002. Using a spreadsheet, the agencies shared and compared the names and personal data of about 45,000 pilots in Northern California, looking for potentially medically unfit individuals who were also receiving federal benefits. Cooper was among four dozen or so pilots tagged as a ""person of interest."" When confronted by government agents, he admitted to a misdemeanor charge of filing a false report. He was sentenced to probation and fined, and his pilot's certificate was revoked. The retired business executive's name was listed in a federal press release and later, through his prosecution, Cooper's medical history suddenly was a matter of public record. ""I had been able to control those (with) whom I shared my information about my HIV status, limited to some co-workers, family, and close friends,"" he said ""And suddenly that was out of my control."" Cooper, who was eventually allowed to fly again, sued. ""I chose not to reveal my HIV infection and that was a very bad thing,"" he said. ""I took responsibility for it and I paid the price. I was punished. And I think now it's the government's turn to own up to breaking the law and take responsibility for what they did."" A federal judge found both the FAA and the Social Security Administration violated the Privacy Act with the information-sharing investigation, but said under the law, only ""actual damages"" could be collected by plaintiffs seeking redress. Since Cooper made no claims for economic harm, such as lost wages or medical expenses, he was out of luck. The judge found ""emotional injury"" alone did not qualify and dismissed the lawsuit. A federal appeals court reversed that decision, ruling for Cooper. The FAA then asked the high court to intervene. During an hour of oral arguments last year, the justices stayed away from the specific claims of emotional harm made by Cooper, focusing instead on what the law says about qualifying for damages. ""The argument you have made -- and I certainly understand it, that this is the Privacy Act and so it's precisely these types of damages that you would be concerned about -- really cuts both ways,"" Chief Justice John Roberts said to Cooper's lawyer. ""What you are saying is this (law) covers a really big chunk of damages, because this is what the whole act was about,"" Roberts said. ""And it seems to me that argument suggests that there is some weight to the government's point: That if you are going to get that, you really do need clearer"" language in the law that would immunize the government to some extent, from a flood of hard-to-disprove lawsuits. The ambiguity has divided lower courts for years, and privacy experts said the ease with which the government can collect and share information in the digital age makes the issue of personal privacy liability ripe for review. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg repeatedly hammered away at the government lawyer arguing for the FAA. She said the federal damages provision in question is similar to state tort claims that include both emotional and financial harm. ""The person who is subject to this, to this embarrassment, this humiliation, doesn't have out-of-pocket costs, but is terribly distressed, nervous, anxious, and all the rest,"" Ginsburg said. ""The act that the Congress is reaching, the impact is of that nature. I mean, pecuniary (monetary) damages ordinarily attend conduct that embarrasses, humiliates you, causes mental distress."" Eric Feigin of the Justice Department said the Privacy Act's language may be interpreted as allowing damages for such things as ""humiliation, embarrassment and mental anguish,"" but said because the phrase ""actual"" damages remains vague, the government should get the benefit of the doubt, tipping the case in its favor. ""Simply because a plaintiff may have suffered an adverse effect"" from the privacy violation, argued Feigin, ""doesn't mean that the plaintiff suffered actual damages."" Raymond Cardozo, Cooper's lawyer, pointed out during the hearing that his client's information was made public and his name and HIV status are still posted on a federal government database. He also made a larger argument, that his client's dilemma is one that may affect all Americans. ""Congress passed this act to restore the citizens' faith in their government, and it made a solemn promise to the American citizens that in cases of intentional and willful violation, the United States shall be liable for actual damages,"" Cardozo said. ""Today, the government is proposing that ""actual damages"" be read in a way that renders this act virtually irrelevant. That makes a mockery of that solemn promise."" Cooper attended the public session at the court and expressed optimism afterward he would prevail. ""They've betrayed my trust and I can't get that back,"" Cooper said at the time. ""There was nothing to lose here. I had to do it. It was the right thing to do."" The case is Cooper v. FAA (10-1024).

"(CNN) -- Before they can bask in glory, Boston Marathon runners on Monday will first bake in abnormally high temperatures -- so warm, in fact, that race organizers are taking several steps to warn participants and allow those concerned about the heat to instead run next year. The race, which began in 1897 and bills itself as the world's oldest annually contested marathon, is typically held in relatively cool weather. The average temperature for an April day in Boston is 47 degrees -- with a usual high of 56 and low typically of 40 degrees -- according to the city and National Weather Service. Still, with its rolling hills, the Hopkinton-to-Boston course is often considered among the nation's most grueling marathons even in ideal racing conditions, which usually imply temperatures in this same 40s and 50s range, light winds and cloudy skies. Dangerous weather from Arkansas to Minnesota . But that's far from what runners will encounter this year. Monday's forecast from the National Weather Service calls for sunny skies and a high temperature of 88 degrees, with sustained winds blowing out of the southwest at between 7 and 15 mph. For this reason, the Boston Athletic Association has taken the unusual step of urging even very fit participants to ""run at a slower pace"" and ""frequently take breaks."" ""This will not be a day to run a personal best,"" the race organizer said in its online statement. ""If you choose to run, run safely above all else. Speed can kill."" The BAA also recommended that those who are ""not highly fit"" or who have ""any underlying medical conditions"" not run, even if they have a much sought after bib number. Besides elite runners, people can get a spot in the Boston Marathon by qualifying based on their time in another marathon or getting a position as part of an effort to raise funds for charity. To that end, the association announced last week that any official entrants in the 2012 race can defer and instead run in the 2013 Boston Marathon. Those taking up this option don't have their entry fee refunded but simply reserve a spot in next year's race. The hot weather forecast early this week is exceptional for Boston, though it's in line with the trend that has been building over the first few months of this year. The average temperature in Boston from January through March was 39.4 degrees, the warmest recorded for that time stretch, the weather service reports. Two runners died while participating in November's Philadelphia Marathon, the race's executive Melanie Johnson said. But weather there was not believed to be a factor, as there were cool temperatures, light winds and most cloudy skies throughout the race. That same month, a 30-year-old male runner at the New York City Marathon collapsed with cardiac arrest and was transported to Mount Sinai Hospital.","The Boston Marathon, the world's oldest such race, will be held Monday .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. State Department has issued a warning to American citizens traveling or residing in Uganda to maintain a high level of vigilance as a major African Union summit gets underway Monday. The security warning comes a week after a trio of bombings killed 74 people in Uganda's capital, Kampala, during the World Cup final. Many of those killed and injured had gathered to watch the match. A Somali Islamist militant movement claimed responsibility for the July 11 bombings at two venues. ""All U.S. citizens should consider the possibility of similar terrorist attacks occurring in conjunction with the African Union Summit,"" officials said in a statement released Friday. The summit, which will focus heavily on maternal and child health, began Sunday and continues through July 27, according to the African Union website. Officials are encouraging Americans to take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness in large public gatherings, which they say can be vulnerable targets for extremist or terrorist groups.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Ugandan opposition leader Kizza Besigye was barred from  boarding a flight back home on Wednesday from the Kenyan capital, where he was undergoing treatment, an airline official said. Besigye flew to Nairobi for treatment two weeks ago after he was injured when police pulled him from a vehicle during protests over the rising cost of living in Uganda. The opposition leader said he was traveling with his wife and aide, and had their boarding passes when a Kenya Airways manager told them that there were instructions not to allow them to board. ""We refused to allow him to board because our intelligence advised us that it would not be safe to do so,"" said Chris Karanja, a corporate affairs manager at Kenya Airways. Karanja did not offer any additional details. It was not immediately clear where the order came from or why the action was taken. Besigye said airline officials told him the plane would not be allowed to land In Entebbe, Uganda, with him onboard. His party officials said the Ugandan minister of internal security denied that the government issued the directive. ""This is an example of the ongoing frustrations, concerns and  violations of rights by the Uganda government,"" Besigye said. ""It is the right of every  Ugandan to be able to return home at anytime. The government does not  respect the rule of law."" Besigye has been thrown in jail several times for spearheading ""walk-to-work"" protests,  contending that the government is manipulating prices for fuel and commodities. Authorities in the east African nation had warned protesters that the gatherings are unlawful and participants will be prosecuted. Despite being held in Kenya, protests will proceed, according to Besigye. ""The walk-to-pray scheduled for tomorrow would still go on even if I'm not in the country. It's not dependent on me,"" he said. ""There are Ugandans and activists in the country who want to advance their rights."" A Ugandan government spokesman did not answer calls for comment.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Ugandan opposition leader Kizza Besigye remained at a private hospital here on Saturday for treatment and observation following his arrest earlier this week, his sister said. Besigye's sister, a medical doctor in Uganda, said her brother has suffered from temporary blindness and serious bruising since his arrest in Uganda on Thursday. She spoke to CNN by phone from Uganda's capital city of Kampala. ""He has had several tests,"" said Olive Kobusingye, ""to test the toxicology of the substance that police sprayed in his eyes."" An assistant to Besigye said the opposition leader is in serious condition and that his doctors have deemed him ""too weak"" to talk to anyone. He will be kept in observation for at least another night, said the assistant in Nairobi. CNN could not independently confirm the reports of Besigye's health. Meanwhile, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni was also in Nairobi on Saturday, addressing a popular private business forum. He spoke just one day after hundreds of angry protesters faced off with security police in the streets of Kampala. At least four people were killed and 120 injured, according to the Ugandan minister of internal affairs. Rioters were angry at the government and upset over Besigye's latest arrest. Besigye has been arrested several times this month. After his fourth arrest on Wednesday, he was released on bail and ordered by the court not to protest for seven months. Defying orders, Besigye hit the streets again Thursday, where men in civilian clothing smashed his car and sprayed him in the face with pepper spray before loading him into a police car. ""Apparently it was after that opposition leader who sprayed the police with that pepper spray first,"" said Museveni. ""I think the lenses of CNN didn't see very well. It was that leader who did that first."" Journalists working for CNN on the scene and videos of the arrest report no attack on the police prior to Besigye's arrest. Responding to opposition claims that several demonstrators have been killed by police using live ammunition, Museveni said that their deaths will be ""investigated."" ""This will not escalate. We will defeat them,"" he said about protesters. ""My democracy is a democracy with discipline."" Besigye lost presidential bids in 2001, 2006 and 2011. Museveni has led the east African nation for 25 years.","Kizza Besigye is suffering from temporary blindness and serious bruising, his sister says .

"(CNN) -- Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, a former politician and militia leader, went on trial Monday in The Hague, Netherlands, accused of crimes against humanity and war crimes including murder, rape and pillaging. ""Jean-Pierre Bemba used an entire army as a weapon to rape, pillage and kill civilians the Central African Republic,"" International Criminal Court prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said as the long-awaited trial began. ""Today, he is brought to account for deliberately failing to prevent, repress or punish mass atrocities committed by his men"" in the central African nation, he said. Bemba, a former vice president in the Democratic Republic of Congo, is accused of leading his militia in attacks on civilians in the Central African Republic for almost five months, according to the International Federation for Human Rights. Under his leadership, his Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC) allegedly murdered, raped and pillaged in the neighboring country between October 2002 and March 2003, the court said. His defense team says the Central African Republic's government was accountable for the actions of the MLC. Bemba sat with his arms folded across his chest as proceedings began, his chin slightly raised. His lawyer confirmed that Bemba understood the charges against him and his rights in court, including the right to remain silent or to enter a plea. Last month, the International Criminal Court (ICC) turned down an appeal by Bemba and cleared the way for the trial. Bemba's defense had challenged his case's admissibility on the grounds that the Central African Republic -- the country the alleged crimes occurred in -- investigated the case and made a ""decision not to prosecute."" The ICC decided that the Central African Republic's action does not prohibit the case from being tried. The British Foreign Office welcomed the beginning of the trial. ""I am pleased that the very serious allegations against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo will be fully investigated in an independent and fair trial,"" Henry Bellingham, the British minister for Africa, said in a statement. ""I also welcome the role that the victims of the crimes committed in Central African Republic will be able to play in the trial proceedings,"" he said.","NEW: Jean-Pierre Bemba used army ""to rape, pillage and kill civilians,"" prosecutors say .

"(CNN) -- Activision is reloading the golden gun to take another shot at reviving a James Bond video game relic. The game publisher plans to unveil a new 007 shooter based on the 16-year-old Pierce Brosnan flick, ""GoldenEye,"" at a news conference later this month, said a spokeswoman helping organize the Activision event. The formal announcement is to take place on July 20 in San Diego at the annual Comic-Con expo. There, Activision will also show upcoming games in the ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men"" series. Activision Publishing registered Web domains last month suggesting the title of the new Bond game may be ""GoldenEye 007: Reloaded."" The next Bond film, which is codenamed Bond 23, is scheduled to open in theaters on November 9, 2012. ""GoldenEye"" was neither the highest grossing nor the most memorable Bond movie. But the ""GoldenEye 007"" game resonates with many people, even today. In the late '90s, the four-player shooting game was part of a nightly ritual at many college dormitories and after-school meet-ups. Rare, which created ""Donkey Kong Country"" and was later acquired by Microsoft, developed the cult classic, and Nintendo published it exclusively for the Nintendo 64 console. Rare's and Nintendo's divorce, along with Activision becoming the exclusive rights holder to develop Bond games, has spun an elaborate web that has left the original ""GoldenEye 007"" landlocked. Nintendo and Microsoft have been unable to come to terms on how to redistribute the game. Rare's ""Perfect Dark,"" a futuristic spy franchise, was billed as the spiritual successor to ""GoldenEye."" Several ""GoldenEye"" designers left Rare to form a studio called Free Radical Design, which develops the ""TimeSplitters"" games. But the ""GoldenEye"" name, story and characters hold a special place in many gamers' hearts. Seeing that opportunity, Activision remade the game and released ""007: GoldenEye"" for Nintendo's Wii in November. Developer Eurocom replaced Brosnan's likeness with that of Daniel Craig, the current Bond actor. The Wii is not typically associated with first-person shooter games, and the ""GoldenEye"" reboot didn't necessarily break that mold. But Eurocom has said it was satisfied with the sales. Treyarch developed a recent Bond game, based on the ""Quantum of Solace"" film. Most recently, it made ""Call of Duty: Black Ops."" Treyarch was not tapped to make the upcoming ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3,"" and it has not said what its next project will be. Game industry watchers suggest the new ""GoldenEye"" will be released on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, two systems where shooting games have thrived.","Activision is planning to announce a new James Bond game later this month .

"London, England (CNN) -- British airlines should stop ""kowtowing"" to American security demands like making passengers take off their shoes and remove laptops from carry-on bags, the chairman of British Airways argued at an industry conference. Some security checks required by the Americans are ""completely redundant,"" Martin Broughton said at the UK Airport Operators conference in London Monday night, BA confirmed to CNN. He also criticized the United States for demanding tighter security on inbound international flights than they do for U.S. domestic travel. ""America does not do internally a lot of the things they demand that we do,"" he said. ""We shouldn't stand for that. We should say, 'We'll only do things which we consider to be essential and that you Americans also consider essential.' ""We all know there's quite a number of elements in the security program which are completely redundant and they should be sorted out,"" he said. A U.S. government security official dismissed Broughton's comments. ""These off-the-cuff comments by an individual representing a private, for-profit entity in no way reflect the close working relationship between the U.S. and the U.K. and are not indicative of the cooperative security efforts enjoyed by our two nations,"" the official said. ""These comments are simply out of touch with current intelligence-driven security policies."" But other industry executives were quick to support the British Airways executive. ""There will no doubt be widespread agreement,"" said the head of the Board of Airline Representatives in the United Kingdom. ""It is about time the industry stepped back and had a look at what is really required and what we can do without, ensuring safety is not compromised,"" Mike Carrivick told CNN. He said the industry should take ""technological advances"" into account when examining the ""layer upon layer"" of security measures that have been added over the years. The umbrella organization represents 85 airlines. Airport Operators Association spokesman Paul Kehoe said industry professionals ""need to look at security again."" ""For the passengers, it's a tedious experience to queue for security, and if there are measures that don't need to be there, they shouldn't be. It's good for someone to challenge the industry,"" he told CNN. Philip Hammond, British transport minister, says that the government is responding to industry concerns. ""I have listened to your concerns regarding the need to reform the regulatory framework for aviation security,"" he said Monday at the same conference where BA's Broughton was speaking. ""And I intend to develop a new regulatory system, one where the government concentrates on setting the security outcomes that need to be achieved, and frees up operators to devise the security processes needed to deliver them in line with EU requirements,"" he said. The United States Transportation Security Administration said it ""works closely with our international partners to ensure the best possible security.  We constantly review and evolve our security measures based on the latest intelligence."" A TSA official said: ""screening shoes increases security at the checkpoint. Shoes remain a security concern because items may be hidden within the shoe and therefore they must continue to be thoroughly screened.  Screening shoes by X-ray is an effective method of identifying any type of anomaly, including explosives."" The flight comparison website Skyscanner said ""passengers are increasingly impatient with the time needed for current security checks."" ""Travellers are in favor of anything which will make security checks faster, but they need to feel confident that safety measures have not been compromised too,"" said Barry Smith, Skyscanner's co-founder and business director, citing passenger surveys conducted by the website. Smiths Detection, which makes airport security equipment, said systems are constantly evolving in response to threats. ""There is no one single solution to aviation security and we strongly agree that there should be common international standards,"" Smiths President Stephen Phipson told CNN. ""These standards should help ensure consistency of security measures, airport efficiency and customer experience,"" he said. Airports began asking passengers to remove their shoes for scanning after Richard Reid, a passenger on a flight from France to the United States in December 2001, hid explosives in his shoes in a failed attempt to blow up a plane. Large quantities of liquid were banned from cabins in 2006 after British authorities broke up what they said was a plot to use liquid explosives to bring down U.S.-bound planes. And airport security authorities have feared for decades that explosives could be hidden inside electronics, going back to the days of the Walkman. CNN's Ayesha Durgahee, Per Nyberg, Carol Cratty and Eileen Hsieh contributed to this report.","NEW: US official: ""Off-the-cuff"" remarks don't reflect US-UK working relationship .

"(CNN) -- Plane makers swooped to conquer at Asia's biggest air show but rather than picking up any huge deals, smaller agreements and partnerships were the order of the day. The event still saw $31 billion worth of deals announced; triple the total of the previous show in 2010. However, two thirds of that was down to Indonesian low-cost airline Lion Air formally sealing its deal for 230 next-generation Boeing 737s, first reported last year. ""The fate of the commercial aviation industry generally follows the fate of national economies,"" says Siva Govindasamy of Flightglobal. ""The mood generally is a little bit uncertain, but (the outcome from the show) is a little better than expected."" Indonesia's economy is one of Asia's fastest growing -- GDP grew there by 6.5% last years -- and Lion Air also announced another deal this week for a fleet of short-haul planes from ATR for its subsidiary, Wings Air. Budget Indian airline Go Air joined the billion-dollar deal club by signing an agreement with engine maker Pratt Whitney, worth around $1 billion. ""(These deals) shows a greater trend that developing countries are leading the world in demand (for new planes),"" says Govindasamy. ""Indonesia is an underdeveloped market; there is no doubt there's great potential in the region."" But on the same day that Air Australia went into administration stranding 4,000 passengers, there is some apprehension that the region could be blighted by airlines with too many planes and not enough passengers to fill them. ""When airlines start to fail that's a bit of a worry. India definitely has over-capacity. Any airline has to be cautious about adding capacity irrationally. Historically the airline industry hasn't done that,"" says Govindasamy. AirAsia has found itself in a good position, and perhaps an example to others, says Govindasamy, by building up a good base in its home market before taking on the world. ""If you don't get the base right, you won't succeed in this industry."" The week also saw Chinese plane maker Comac announcing another corporate client (Bank of China) for its yet to be built C919 jet. But these smaller deals belie the impact China's aviation industry may have in two years' time when the jet is first trialed, believes the Singapore Air Show organizer, Jimmy Lau. ""The market is very dispersed in China, but when the Comac C919 plane goes to market its capability will be stronger,"" he says. China's market is unique and Govindasamy believes its airlines are in a good position to not do things irrationally. ""They are doing a lot of things right, but then they are supported by the government and often fulfilling a national need in terms of flying routes that might not be so profitable.""","Smaller deals and agreements a feature of Singapore air show .

"(CNN) -- The body of a boy was found Friday afternoon near the wreckage of a plane crash in Lake Wales, Florida, raising the final death toll to six, officials said. The plane, which was carrying a husband, wife and their four children, went down Thursday. The other bodies had already been recovered. ""We can tell you that none are now unaccounted for,"" Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said. ""It's just a tragic event of monumental proportion, but we're pleased that we're at least reuniting the entire family."" The last victim to be found was in thick underbrush about half a mile southwest of the main wreckage, Judd said. The flight originated at Treasure Cay Airport in the Bahamas and landed at St. Lucie County Airport at 10:15 a.m. Thursday to clear customs. The plane left St. Lucie just after noon, and the first 911 call came in at 12:36 p.m., said Judd. Its final destination was Junction City, Kansas. The plane began to break apart and crashed, going down in a remote, palmetto-covered stretch near Lake-Walk-In-The-Water that is not easily accessible, officials said. Rescuers and investigators used all-terrain vehicles to get to the scene. Plane parts were reported as far as four miles away. The cause of the crash is not clear but is under investigation, said Tim Monville, an investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board. ""We have parts structurally separated. I don't know what that means yet. We'll have to investigate. That's what we're here for,"" he said. The Polk County Sheriff's Office identified the family as Ronald Bramlage, 45; his wife, Rebecca Bramlage, 43; and their children, Brandon, 15; Boston, 13; Beau, 11; and Roxanne, 8. Boston was believed to be the last one found. The plane is a Pilatus PC-12/47 owned by Roadside Ventures LLC of Junction City. The Bramlage family is well-known in the Kansas State University community. Ronald and Rebecca Bramlage were both graduates, and Fred Bramlage, Ronald's father, was the lead contributor to the Bramlage Coliseum, a multipurpose arena that is home to the men's and women's basketball teams.","The sixth and final body is recovered .

"(CNN) -- One of the main suspects in the killings of 49 people in northern Mexico received orders from the top leaders of the Zetas cartel, a military official said Monday. Daniel de Jesus Elizondo Ramirez hurled a grenade and fired at troops with a rifle as they closed in on him, Brig. Gen. Edgar Luis Villegas told reporters. After his capture Friday outside Monterrey, Mexico, he disclosed details of the brutal slayings, Villegas said. Elizondo, also known as ""El Loco"" (""The Madman""), is a local leader of the Zetas drug cartel in Cadereyta, Nuevo Leon, the northern Mexican city where authorities found the decapitated and dismembered bodies abandoned along a highway last week, Villegas said. The grisly discovery on May 13 drew international attention but was met with a muted response from some Mexicans living in the area, where intensifying turf battles between rival cartels have made violence a daily reality. Authorities announced Elizondo's arrest Sunday and presented him to the media Monday, detailing his alleged involvement in kidnappings and killings in northern Mexico, and in the Zetas' efforts to expand their reach into Guatemala. Orders for abandoning the 49 mutilated bodies last week came from the highest levels of the Zetas, Villegas said, including Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, the group's top leader. Elizondo and an accomplice were ordered to abandon the bodies in the town's central square, but instead left them on the outskirts, Villegas said. Authorities described him as ""one of the suspects responsible"" for last week's killings but did not specify how he was involved in the slayings. He will be detained for 40 days while authorities build their case against him, prosecutors said. The whereabouts of the suspected accomplice, another member of the Zetas who escaped during a prison uprising in February, were unclear. Last week, Mexico's interior minister said the 49 decapitated bodies were the result of a fierce feud over territory and power between the Zetas and members of the allied Gulf and Sinaloa cartels. Banners hanging throughout the country, purportedly from the Zetas, said the notoriously ruthless cartel had nothing to do with the gruesome crime. ""This was part of a strategy to blame the actions on opposing criminal organizations ... to cause confusion among authorities and in the public opinion,"" Villegas said Monday. The Zetas began with deserters from Mexican special forces, who quickly gained a reputation for ruthless violence as hired assassins for Mexico's Gulf cartel. The partnership between the two criminal groups ended in 2010. Now, officials say the Gulf cartel is allied with the Sinaloa cartel, one of the nation's most powerful drug trafficking groups. Elizondo confessed his involvement in other attacks against authorities and members of the Gulf cartel, Villegas said, including carrying out kidnappings and executions and transporting bodies to an area where they were buried or burned. He also traveled to Guatemala with a group of Zetas hit men in 2008, battling over territory with drug gangs there, Villegas said. Authorities have not released the identities of the victims of last week's killings in northern Mexico. Last week, officials said investigators were seeking DNA samples from families of missing people nationwide in their efforts to identify the bodies. That will be the only way to identify the victims -- whose killers cut off their heads, hands and feet -- Nuevo Leon state security spokesman Jorge Domene told reporters. More than 47,500 people have died in drug-related violence in Mexico since December 2006, when Mexican President Felipe Calderon announced plans to deploy troops in efforts to combat cartels. According to Mexico's National Human Rights Commission, more than 5,300 people have disappeared throughout the country in that same time period, and the bodies of 9,000 dead have not been identified. Officials fear the total number of missing could be far higher, because many disappearances go unreported.

"(CNN) -- The Sudanese president has vowed to ""never give up"" a disputed oil-rich region that has escalated tensions with South Sudan and sparked fears of the two neighbors' return to war. Clashes between the two nations soared in the past week after South Sudan declared the disputed Heglig region is under its control. Sudan also claims ownership and has lodged complaints with the United Nations and the African Union, urging them to pressure South Sudan to withdraw troops from its territory. The United States on Thursday called for both sides to stop the hostilities. ""We condemn South Sudan's military involvement in the attack on and seizure of Heglig, an act which goes beyond self-defense and has increased tensions between Sudan and South Sudan to dangerous levels,"" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. ""We also condemn the continued aerial bombardment in South Sudan by the Sudanese Armed Forces."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged both countries to return to the negotiating table. ""The last thing the people of these two countries need is another war -- a war that could claim countless lives, destroy hope and ruin the prospects of peace and stability and prosperity of all Sudanese people,"" he said. China, which has invested heavily Sudan's oil industry, also argued for calm. ""China again calls for the two countries to immediately stop hostility and respect each other's sovereignty,"" Liu Weiming, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a regular news briefing Thursday. During a rally broadcast on state media, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir said, ""We will never give up an inch of our land. And we have said it before, whoever extends his hand toward Sudan, we will cut it off."" The international community has urged Sudan and South Sudan to return to the table amid intensified tensions. South Sudan split from its neighbor in July under the terms of a 2005 peace agreement that ended decades of a civil war. During the defiant speech, the Sudanese leader told citizens that ""Heglig is in Kordofan,"" referring to a border state owned by the nation. ""We will punish them ... and it will be the last lesson for them,"" he said. ""If they do not understand, we will make them get it by force. We extended our hand before for peace and unity. But they deceived us. Heglig is the start."" South Sudan did not immediately respond to the latest speech, but a military official vowed to retain a grip on the region a day earlier. ""We will hold this position,"" said Maj. Gen. Mangar Buong, a deputy commander for the South Sudanese military. Princeton Lyman, the U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan and South Sudan, has been in both countries recently, holding meetings with government officials. There is ""an enormous amount of very emotional, very powerful rhetoric coming from here in Khartoum raising the stakes in many ways and that's worrisome in and of itself,"" he said on a conference call from Khartoum on Thursday. But he said that based on the discussions he'd had in both Khartoum and Juba, ""I can say with confidence that virtually everyone I have talked to has said, 'Look, we don't want to go to all out war with the other, we need to find a way out.' "" Tensions run deep between the two nations, which have outstanding issues despite their divorce last year. Unresolved issues include status of citizens, how much the landlocked South should pay to transport its oil through Sudan and the division of national debt, among others. The fate of disputed border areas is also a point of contention. As long-simmering tensions soar, rights group are warning of deteriorating humanitarian conditions. ""The deteriorating situation right now is making the overall humanitarian issues very challenging,"" said Alex Neve, secretary-general of Amnesty International Canada. Neve, who is in the South Sudan capital of Juba, said supply lines at refugee camps have been cut off and failure to get key supplies before the rains will lead to a humanitarian crisis. In addition, there are reports of human rights violations. ""The refugees coming in across the border have consistent stories of aerial bombardments and ground attacks"" from Sudanese soldiers, he said. CNN's Amir Ahmed, David McKenzie, Faith Karimi and Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. envoy says both sides want to avoid war despite rhetoric .

"(CNN) -- Eight American soldiers died of overdoses involving heroin, morphine or other opiates during deployments in Afghanistan in 2010 and 2011, according to U.S. Army investigative reports. The overdoses were revealed in documents detailing how the Army investigated a total of 56 soldiers, including the eight who fell victim to overdoses, on suspicion of possessing, using or distributing heroin and other opiates. At the same time, heroin use apparently is on the rise in the Army overall, as military statistics show that the number of soldiers testing positive for heroin has grown from 10 instances in fiscal year 2002 to 116 in fiscal year 2010. Army officials didn't respond to repeated requests for comment on Saturday. But records from the service's Criminal Investigation Command, obtained by the conservative legal group Judicial Watch, provided glimpses into how soldiers bought drugs from Afghan juveniles, an Afghan interpreter and in one case, an employee of a Defense Department contractor, who was eventually fired. The drug use is occurring in a country that is estimated to supply more than 90% of the world's opium, and the Taliban insurgency is believed to be stockpiling the drug to finance their activities, according to a 2009 U.N. study. While the records show some soldiers using heroin, much of the opiate abuse by U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan involves prescription drugs such Percocet, the Army documents show. Judicial Watch obtained the documents under the Freedom of Information of Act and provided them to CNN. Spokesman Col. Gary Kolb of the International Security Assistance Force, the NATO-led command in Afghanistan, verified the documents to CNN on Saturday. One fatal overdose occurred in June 2010 at Forward Operating Base Blessing, after a soldier asked another soldier to buy black tar opium from a local Afghan outside the base's entry control point. The first soldier died after consuming the opium like chewing tobacco and smoking pieces of it in a cigarette, the documents show. The reports even show soldier lingo for the drug -- calling it ""Afghani dip"" in one case where three soldiers were accused of using the opiate, the Army investigative reports show. The United States has 89,000 troops in Afghanistan. The U.S. death toll since the September 11, 2001, attacks that triggered the war has risen to more than 1,850, including 82 this year, according to the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Central Command. Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, said his group was interested in soldiers' drug use partly because the risk was present during the Vietnam War. ""You never want to see news of soldiers dying of drug use in Afghanistan,"" Fitton said. ""Our concern is, will the military treat this as the problem that it is, and are the families of the soldiers aware of the added risk in this drug-infested country? ""There is a dotted line between the uses. Prescription abuse can easily veer into heroin drug use,"" Fitton added. ""Afghanistan is the capital of this opiate production and the temptation is great there and the opportunity for drug use all the more."" The group is concerned that ""there hasn't been enough public discussion, and we would encourage the leadership to discuss or talk about this issue more openly,"" Fitton said. In one case, a soldier bought heroin and the anti-anxiety drug Xanax from five ""local national juveniles at multiple locations on Camp Phoenix, Afghanistan, and consumed them,"" one report states. Soldiers also distributed heroin, Percocet and other drugs among themselves, according to the reports. Another soldier fatally overdosed in December 2010 after taking several drugs, including morphine and codeine, though the drugs were not prescribed for him, the Army documents show. One female soldier broke into the Brigade Medical Supply Office at Forward Operating Base Shank and stole expired prescription narcotics including morphine, Percocet, Valium, fentanyl and lorazepam, the documents show. The investigative reports show soldiers using other drugs, including steroids and marijuana, and even hashish that was sold to U.S. servicemen by the Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police personnel, the reports state. CNN's Sarah Jones and Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this report.","Eight soldiers died of overdoses involving heroin, morphine or other opiates in 2010-11 .

"(CNN) -- Italian club Udinese has pledged to ensure the disabled sister of Piermario Morosini is looked after for the rest of her life following the sudden death of the footballer during a Serie B match on Saturday. Morosini's parents and brother died in his teens, and his death at the age of 25 leaves only his sister, Maria Carla. Morosini was playing on loan at Livorno from Serie A side Udinese, which said in a statement on its website that the severely disabled Maria Carla is cared for in a residential facility in Bergamo, and has ""no-one left but an elderly aunt."" ""Our duty is now not to leave her alone after fate has taken away from her all her family,"" Udinese said. The club published the details of a bank account and is inviting donations from other clubs in order to establish a fund that will be administered by Maria Carla's legal guardian. Morosini died after suffering suspected cardiac arrest during the first half against Pescara. He was taken to hospital where doctors tried unsuccessfully to revive him. All of the weekend's matches in the Italian league were postponed, and a period of silence was observed at many other games across the world. Former Italy Under-21 international Morosini moved to Udinese in 2005, but made only five appearances and had been loaned out to several clubs. He joined Livorno in January. ""He was an exceptional lad, so full of life,"" Udinese captain Antonio di Natale told the club's television channel. ""Despite all the problems he had, he was always at the disposal of the team and every day he gave us all strength."" Di Natale said it was the club's duty to look after Morosini's sister. ""We know the situation of his sister and we as a team, the club, and Udinese for Life (the club charity) have decided to help her because she is in real need,"" he said. ""It is essential that we stay at the side of Piermario's sister for her entire life. She needs us and we want to help, both for her and for Mario.""

"(CNN) -- Microsoft is taking its last big step before releasing what promises to be a massive overhaul of its Windows operating system -- and, by extension, how almost all devices running it work. Nearing the end of a long process of tinkering under the hood, the computing giant on Friday rolled out its final preview of Windows 8, which is expected to go on sale this fall. ""Since our first preview release last September, millions of people now use the pre-release product on a daily basis and millions more have been taking it through its paces, totaling hundreds of millions of hours of testing,"" Microsoft's Steven Sinofsky wrote Friday on the Windows 8 blog. ""We genuinely appreciate the effort that so many have put into pre-release testing, and of course, we appreciate the feedback too. Direct feedback and feedback through usage contributed to hundreds of visible changes in the product and tens of thousands of under-the-hood changes."" The post said Microsoft has received about 18,000 comments from 7,000 early testers of Windows 8, which have contributed to ""hundreds of visible changes in the product and tens of thousands of under-the-hood changes."" The release will mark the first major update of Microsoft's operating system since Windows 7 was released three years ago. Unlike previous releases that have, essentially, revamped (or, in at least one case, mercifully killed) existing features, Microsoft is touting Windows 8 as a radical reimagining of its core product. Perhaps its most visible difference from previous versions of Windows will be its compatibility with touchscreen technology. That, combined with the system's ability to connect devices (say, a PC, a tablet and a Xbox gaming console) is what Microsoft hopes will renew the enduring Mac vs. PC war on a new front. ""In our hands-on of Microsoft's Consumer Preview, we declared that your familiar Windows desktop is all but dead,"" Alexandra Chang wrote Friday for Wired. ""In the changes we've seen in the Release Preview, this still holds true,"" she added. ""Microsoft is focused on improving and deepening the Metro [the system's design language] experience, where the desktop is only a portion -- or even an afterthought, for some users -- of a larger, app-based system."" The company has made something of a ripple with its smartphone system, at least among critics. The recently released Nokia Lumia 900 has been heralded as the best Windows phone ever, although, as of March, only about 4% of U.S. smartphones ran the company's operating system. (For what it's worth, that's a month before the Lumia was released.) But Microsoft has barely moved the needle in the tablet space, where Apple still rules the roost, and only a simpler and less expensive device like Amazon's Kindle Fire has been able to put up much resistance. Even as the final Windows 8 trial was being announced, reports were surfacing that Asus, Toshiba and Acer all plan to unveil Windows tablets next week at the Computex trade show in Taipei. Meanwhile, many in the tech world are watching and waiting. With its prowess in the computing world, it's impossible to count Microsoft out. But with Apple and Google's Android system grabbing the attention and market share in the mobile world, Microsoft appears to have an uphill battle. ""There's a long, narrow road ahead for Windows 8,"" reviewer Seth Rosenblatt wrote for CNET. ""It could be the next big thing, but there's not much room for missteps.""","Microsoft rolls out its final preview version of Windows 8 .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Amene Tekele Haymanot thought he had made the right choice when five years ago he escaped war-torn Eritrea and opened a business in sunny Tel Aviv, Israel. But he and his countrymen couldn't escape conflict for long. Haymanot never expected himself - or his store -- to become targets of threats and violence in a metropolitan city known for its tolerance. But it was. His windows were smashed in and his business looted during an anti-immigration protest. ""Now I am afraid here. I cannot live this way. I'm afraid for my life,"" Haymanot, who is an illegal immigrant awaiting refugee status, told CNN. His fear has been growing for many months because illegal African immigrants have attracted anger in certain parts of Israel -- and Haymanot believes the color of his skin makes him vulnerable -- because many here will assume if you're black in his Tel Aviv neighborhood -- you are here illegally. Many Israelis are frustrated with the estimated 59,000 illegal African immigrants in the country and Israel's inability to deal with them. Most of the new arrivals are from Eritrea and Sudan, and the government says they come illegally through the Egyptian border. The police say about 700 African immigrants enter the country illegally every week. Illegal African immigrants are blamed by residents in neighborhoods where there is a large African population for increasing levels of crime, suffocating the infrastructure and changing the fabric of Israel. Many Israelis who sympathize with the plight of African immigrants say they believe racism plays into all this. Some Israelis are asking how a country that founded by Jews trying to escape persecution could turn against anyone trying to escape danger in their own lands. Attorney Asaf Weitzen, who works with the immigrant hotline in the south Tel Aviv neighbourhood of Hatikva, trying to sort out immigrants' legal problems, says: ""There is a very big pressure on the neighborhood, and the structures cannot support so many people."" He adds that the problem is exacerbated because newcomers come from a different background, speak a different language and have a different approach to life as well as by the fact they are a different race. The biggest problem that immigrants and Israel face, Weitzen says, is the lack of a proper and enforceable immigration policy. He says the Eritrea population should be award asylum and given the necessary papers to work. His words echo the call from the United Nations for Eritreans to be given refugee status due to conditions in their home country. But Israel has no diplomatic relations with Sudan, the source of the second largest illegal immigrant group in the country, so repatriating those immigrants is nearly impossible. The current Israeli policy leaves the immigrants in an unsustainable holding pattern, says Weitzen: They are not allowed to legally work but do so anyway, leaves residents frustrated as the number of poor grow in certain neighborhoods, putting pressure on everything from housing to hospitals. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the immigration problem is being dealt with. ""The problem of infiltrators must be resolved and we will resolve it,"" he said last Thursday. ""We will complete the construction of the security fence in several months and soon will start the process of sending the migrants back to their home countries."" Anti-immigrant sentiment is particularly strong in Hatikva, partly due to the influx of large numbers of African immigrants who have moved in there. In May an anti-immigration protest numbering several hundred demonstrators boiled over into all-out violence bashing in a few store and car windows owned by African immigrants. (TRY THIS FIX) Israeli protesters chanted slogans such as ""infiltrators get out"" and ""Tel Aviv: A refugee camp"". Three members of the right wing Likud party -- part of the governing coalition - were among the politicians who attended. One of them, Miri Regev, was quoted as saying that ""the Sudanese are like a cancer in society."" Police arrested 17 Israeli protesters at the demonstration and charged them with property damage. In two separate cases in May, two African illegal immigrants were arrested and charged with raping teenage Israeli girls, sparking even more tension between the communities in some parts of the country. Even mentioning the issue of illegal immigration in the neighborhood where the violence broke out causes crowds of residents to form. One was close to tears about the situation, saying that people feared the influx of Africans -- and sometimes Africans themselves. ""They come by group, by group, by group and I [am] alone, I [am] afraid,"" said long-time resident David Ovady, who has lived in south Tel Aviv for 40-plus years. He held up a container of pepper spray that he now keeps with him at all times when he is walking around the neighborhood. Dror Kahalani, a community activist who has lived in the neighborhood for 45 years, said through tears that he knows the immigrants are human beings and need help -- but that it's not up to residents to foot the bill for them. ""The government must, must in every meaning of the word, starting tomorrow morning,"" said Kahalani, ""gather them all together, build them a tent city and give them solutions, food, medical, everything they need, give it to them. But not here."" In the aftermath of the attacks and arrests, visual reminders of the tension are gone but not the sentiment. ""Someone has to take over the law,"" Kahalani said. The day after the attacks, Netanyahu denounced the violence and what many described as provocative language used against the illegal immigrants. ""I would like to stress that the expressions and acts that we have viewed last night are unacceptable,"" the prime minister said. Amene Tekele Haymanot, who works and lives in Hatikva, says that his Israeli neighbors continue to make threats and intimidate him even after breaking apart his business. He says Israelis in the neighborhood threatened to kill him and burn his place down. With no official refugee status he now wants to close his store and move somewhere where he can live in peace. So far he can't seem to find that, no matter where he goes.","Tension has flared in parts of Israel between some immigrants from Africa and residents of the neighborhood .

"Washington (CNN) -- Ten years ago in September, rescue workers began inhaling a toxic mix of airborne debris that curled out of the World Trade Center's mangle of steel, re-bar and concrete, coating in white the clothes and at times the lungs of emergency responders who worked at ground zero. Thousands descended on New York and Washington in 2001 in a desperate attempt to help those who had perished, or would soon die, after a series of coordinated attacks rocked the nation and redefined its security mandate. But news of the death of Osama bin Laden -- al Qaeda's figurehead killed during a gun battle in Pakistan -- offered Americans a happier reason to gasp. ""It's wild,"" said Tyler Smith, wiping away his swelling tears as he held a cigarette that trembled between his fingertips. He was at the White House celebration. ""It's just very intense."" The young veteran -- who served in Afghanistan in 2004 and 2005 -- then grabbed his baseball cap, pulling it down to shield his watering eyes from view. ""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""I just don't have the words."" Americans celebrated early Monday in a show of patriotism against the man who committed much of his life to attacking U.S. citizens and others. In front of the White House, chants of ""U.S.A.! U.S.A.!"" filled the night air, and the group spontaneously broke into an off-key rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" Other revelers hearkened back to the turmoil of that fateful blue-sky day in September. ""I was in D.C. during 9/11,"" said 33-year-old Mason Wright, recalling his days as a student at American University in Washington, D.C. From his apartment, Wright said he watched television images of the second hijacked plane as it plunged into the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan. ""It's hard to believe 10 years later it's over ... It's finally come to an end."" Dustin Swensson, who recently served in Iraq, echoed those comments, calling the news ""historic."" Alan Comar, a 29-year-old resident of Washington who worked as a U.S. contractor in Afghanistan, clutched his girlfriend as they gazed across the red, white and blue crowd. ""Its one of those 'got-to-be-there' moments,"" he said. The mood was much more somber at the Pentagon memorial a few miles away, where 184 people died when a hijacked American Airlines Flight crashed on September 11, 2001. ""Everyone was at the White House celebrating, and hardly anyone was at the memorial,"" said Jessica McFarland of Arlington, Virginia. ""I felt like this site put things in perspective."" Meanwhile, teenagers, scarcely old enough to remember the near decade-old attacks, dashed toward the White House gates, eager to join the swelling throng of American revelers. ""It's something that defines a generation,"" said Ashley Cummings, a Michigan resident visiting Washington. ""They're not going to pull out immediately,"" she said, referring to the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. ""There's still a lot of work to be done, but this affirms that they were over there for a reason."" Her comment echoes a question likely to be raised in the coming weeks and months over the ways in which an American-led war in Afghanistan can continue without the specter of the Qaeda leader. ""It's a war that I feel we just won,"" said one former New York firefighter -- who says he was forced to retire due to lung ailments suffered from dust at ground zero -- the site where the World Trade Center's twin towers once stood. Private moments of reflection were happening, too, as loved ones of those killed in the September 11 attacks quietly marked bin Laden's death. Patricia Sliwak-Grinberg said she cried when President Barack Obama began to describe the September 11 attacks as he delivered news of his death. Her brother, Robert Sliwak, was a Cantor-Fitzgerald employee who died in the World Trade Center. In New York, strains of ""God Bless America"" could be heard intermittently trickling through the crowd. The area, once a barren and bitterly contested site, has since given way to the beginnings of construction for a long awaited ""Freedom Tower,"" or the 1 World Trade Center. In another sign of the evolving times, a neighborhood Burger King that medics once converted to a makeshift trauma center following the attacks, now houses a younger fast-food staff mostly unfamiliar with the restaurant's storied past. ""A lot of retired cops still come here and talk about it,"" said Joshua Nash, a 22 year-old employee from Bronx, New York. During the ensuing rescue effort, EMTs treated victims atop dinning tables at the Home of the Whopper, while draping intravenous drips across wall lamps. ""Do you want to know what I really think?,"" asked Nash. ""I think a lot of the people around here yelling and celebrating were just looking for an excuse to get drunk and yell."" ""They don't know what this is about."" His words seem to capture an unease with celebrating death that other New Yorkers quietly reflected. Some just seemed relieved to close the final chapter of bin Laden's life. Carie Lemack, whose mother, Judy, was killed on American Airlines Flight 11, said she can't ""express how this feels to my family. ""Relief is one word."" Jim Riches, who lost his firefighter son, Jimmy, when the World Trade Center's north tower collapsed, said the news offered a bit of comfort. ""(My) son still isn't coming home,"" he said. ""(There's) no closure, but at last, at least some justice for the murder of 3,000 Americans, finally."" Elsewhere in New York, police cordoned off stretches of Manhattan's Financial District where crowds had gathered in celebrations through the night. September 11 has since served as a galvanizing symbol of American patriotism and its willingness to doggedly -- and at times controversially -- pursue enemies across borders. But it remains unclear whether decapitating al Qaeda's infamous figurehead will mark a turning point in a war that has left thousands of Americans dead and killed untold numbers of civilians. In July, NATO offered further support for Afghan President Hamid Karzai's objective of taking on greater responsibility for the country's security by 2014. Analysts, however, remain skeptical, citing corruption and patronage networks that they say enjoy a degree of political protection. Meanwhile, Sunday's news comes just a single day after a Taliban announcement of a renewed offensive against allied troops and Afghan security forces in the region. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Emanuella Grinberg, Christina Zdanowicz and Nicole Saidi contributed to this report.","Celebrations break out in Washington and New York, and on college campuses nationwide .

"(CNN) -- Lukas Rosol, who beat Rafael Nadal in one of the biggest upsets in Wimbledon history, came crashing down to earth Saturday with a straight sets exit to Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber in the third round. Czech Rosol had swept the second seed aside under the Centre Court lights Thursday night but out on Court 12 could not recreate that magic. 27th seed Kohlschreiber, who had also beaten Nadal on grass at Halle two weeks ago, cruised to a 6-2 6-3 7-6 victory. ""Rosol is a big server,"" the German told the official Wimbledon website. ""But I read his serve pretty well today. In the first set I think I played some amazing tennis."" Rosol will return to a second tier Challenger Tour event next week, but Kohlschreiber has earned himself a last 16 clash with American Brian Baker. Qualifier Baker, who has made an astonishing return to the ATP after six years sidelined through a string of injuries, beat Benoit Paire of France 6-4 4-6 6-1 6-3. ""It's been unreal,"" said Baker, who is set to rise well inside the top 100 with his recent performances. He is one of two Americans in the last 16, with Mardy Fish going through after a three set win over Belgian wildcard David Goffin, but their compatriot Andy Roddick is out. The three-time Wimbledon runner-up was beaten 2-6 7-6 6-4 6-3 by Spanish seventh seed David Ferrer. Roddick looked on the way to a fine victory when he took the first set in comprehensive fashion, but Ferrrer dug in to level and then took command. The 29-year-old Roddick, who won the warm-up tournament at Eastbourne, waved to all sides of Centre Court as he departed, increasing speculation about his future. He lost finals to Roger Federer in 2004, 2005 and 2009, but has slipped down the rankings over the past year. Ferrer will next play Juan Martin Del Potro of Argentina, who dispatched Kei Nishikori of Japan 6-3 7-6 6-1, while Fish will face French fifth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who beat Slovakia's Lukas Lacko 6-4 6-3 6-3 to continue his easy run through the draw. Sam Querrey also came up short in a marathon bid to become the third player from the United States into the third round as he lost to 16th seed Marin Cilic in a match taking five hours 31 minutes. Croatian Cilic finally triumphed 7-6 6-4 6-7 6-717-15, the final set lasting more than two hours on its own. It was the second longest match in Wimbledon history behind the world record clash between John Isner and Nicolas Mahut in 2010. Cilic will play British fourth seed Andy Murray, who won a late night thriller under the Centre Court lights to beat Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus. Baghdatis leveled at one set all and was a break up in the third set before Murray hit back to win 7-5 3-6 7-5 6-1 in a match that finished at 2300 local.","Lukas Rosol crashes out to Philipp Kohlshreiber in Wimbledon third round .

"(CNN) -- The Australian Senate has rejected a bill that would have revived plans to process asylum seekers in offshore detention centers in a highly emotional vote following the sinking of two boats packed with people in one week. Senators voted down the legislation by 39 votes to 29, after hours of heated debate that saw one politician break down in tears as she described the plight of one 15-year-old boy's journey from Afghanistan. Soon after the vote, Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced that former defence force chief Angus Houston would lead ""an expert group"" to determine the best way forward on asylum seekers, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""I want to be very clear about the role of this expert group,"" Gillard said. ""This expert group will receive the facts from Government and beyond. They will be able at their option to receive briefings wherever they want to get those briefings from. They will be able to assemble all of the material to help them form their views. They will be able to consult as they see fit,"" the ABC reported. The dilemma of what to do with thousands of asylum seekers who attempt the risky trip by boat to Australia each year has long divided the nation's political parties, and its people. However, the sinking of two boats in the past week carrying more than 300 people lent the issue urgency ahead of parliament's long winter break. More than 200 people were pulled from the sea near Christmas Island, north of Australia, after the separate accidents. It's not clear how many died because authorities don't have an accurate count of how many people were on board the vessels. Two years ago, Mujtaba Ahmadi made a similar treacherous journey from Indonesia on a fishing boat packed with more than 70 other people seeking a new life in Australia. He was just 15 years old. ""We came direct from Jakarta to Christmas Island. There are a lot of ways, this is the short way but it's very dangerous,"" Ahmadi said. ""There were too many people on the boat. We didn't have any space to sleep. We didn't have enough life jackets."" The teenager left Iran with his family's blessing; his father borrowed money from his friends and his mother and sister sold their jewelry to raise $11,000. Some was spent on flights, while half was paid to people smugglers for the 50-hour boat trip. ""I heard that there are a lot of human rights in Australia. That's why I decided to come to Australia,"" he said. ""But then I arrived in a detention center, I thought no, there are no human rights in Australia."" Ahmadi spent two months in detention on Christmas Island before being transferred to a hotel in Darwin, the Asti Motel, which for a time was used as a temporary detention center. He stayed there for eight months before being granted a visa to stay. Now 18, Ahmadi is learning English in Sydney and is following the debate among the nation's politicians as best he can, though he still can't understand why he spent so long in detention. ""We didn't do anything wrong. We are not criminals,"" he said. If the bill -- the Migration Legislation Amendment (The Bali Process) Bill 2012 -- had been passed Thursday, it would have allowed Australia to send asylum seekers to Malaysia and the island of Nauru in the South Pacific for processing. It also would have marked a revival of Gillard's controversial ""Malaysia Solution,"" a deal agreed with the Malaysian government to send 800 asylum seekers there each year for processing in exchange for 4,000 refugees to Australia. The deal was ruled invalid last August by the High Court on the grounds that Malaysia has no legal obligation to protect asylum seekers, something required under Australia's Migration Act. Despite fierce opposition from the coalition and the Greens Party, the House of Parliament narrowly passed the bill late Wednesday, clearing the way for the Senate vote. The Greens said they were pleased the government had announced a multi-party committee to look into the issue, but said more could have been done. ""The government could, today, have taken the pressure off these desperate people to get on boats by immediately resettling thousands of people waiting in Indonesia and Malaysia, properly resourcing the UNHCR and increasing search and rescue capability,"" Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said in a statement. The bill's defeat leaves the country without an effective response to attempts by asylum seekers to enter the country. The expert group has been asked to report back before parliament resumes in mid- August, the ABC said. The number of boats attempting the journey rose dramatically after Labor's Kevin Rudd defeated long-term Liberal leader John Howard in a federal election in 2007. During his time in power, Rudd unraveled Howard's policies, including the ""Pacific Solution,"" which involved diverting asylum seekers to detention camps on remote Pacific islands. The Howard policies were slammed by critics as inhumane, however supporters credited them with deterring large numbers of people from boarding boats to Australia. ""They were humane as they possibly could be in the circumstances,"" Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey told the ABC before Thursday's Senate vote. He said the coalition was pushing for a policy of turning back boats when possible, reopening the processing center on Nauru and granting asylum seekers temporary protection visas. The coalition would never support the Malaysia ""people swap,"" he added. Since replacing Rudd as Labor leader, Gillard has adopted a tougher stance on asylum seekers but has resisted calls from the opposition to return to the Howard policies.","Australian Senate rejects vote on asylum seeker bill to resume offshore processing .

"(CNN) -- Researchers believe the number of children who have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is much higher than previously believed, according to a new study published Monday in the American Journal of Psychiatry. By looking at a total population sample in South Korea, the study authors estimate that 1 in 38 children in the country -- or 2.64% -- has some form of autism. The approach is a new one. Previously, researchers have examined only children known to have the neurological disorder or at high risk of developing it. The study authors predicted that if similar studies were conducted in other countries, the prevalance estimates would also go up. The research also led the study authors to believe that more girls than previously thought fall under the autism umbrella. What is autism? In the United States, the most recent estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for autism prevalence are about 1% or 1 in 110 children, based on population studies in a select number of areas around the country. In this new study, researchers looked at all 55,000 school children in a large metropolitan community of Seoul, which they say is representative not only of South Korea, but also many other developed nations. According to the study, researchers began with 55,266 7- to 12-year-old students. Parents and teachers were asked to fill out an autism screening questionnaire. Parents of 23,234 of the children in the regular school system responded. All 294 children already enrolled in special education or on the disability registry were considered to have tested positive for an autism spectrum disorder. From the initial assessments, 1,214 students screened positive for some form of autism. Only 286 went on to get a full clinical evaluation, of which 201 were diagnosed with some form of autism. Using mathematical algorithms, researchers estimate 1 in 38 children in South Korea have an autism spectrum disorder. ""Are we surprised? Yes,"" said Dr. Young Shin Kim, lead author of the study and assistant professor at the Child Study Center at the Yale School of Medicine. Kim said the prevalence estimates in the study, which happened to take place in South Korea, are higher than previous estimates elsewhere, including but not exclusively the United States. Kim said she believes if more studies like this are done in other countries, they, too, will find an autism rate of 2-3%, while acknowledging that more research needs to be done to validate the study results. In depth autism coverage on The Chart . The study doesn't mean that suddenly many more children have autism, Kim said. Instead, she suggests ""they have been there all along but they were not counted in previous prevalence studies,"" and that ""two-thirds are in the community unrecognized and untreated."" Roy Richard Grinker, a cultural anthropologist at George Washington University and one of the co-authors of the study, said he thinks the study's estimates are ""surprising"" but he doesn't think they are alarming. What these estimates tell us, he said, is that ""autism is more common than we think it is."" Autism and communication . Grinker said he would compare the situation in South Korea to where the United States was 20 years ago, as far as autism awareness goes. He said when the study began in 2005, South Koreans believed that autism was rare in their country. He cited one South Korean official who he said estimated the prevalence of autism to be about 1 in 100,000. At that same time, the CDC estimated autism prevalence to be about 1 in 150 children and Australian researchers believed it to be around 1 in 160 children. Since then, new research has led to a 1 in 110 prevalence estimate. When asked about the newest estimates, Dr. Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp, chief of the Developmental Disabilities Branch of the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at the CDC, said, ""We've always said that what we report is an underestimate."" She said there are different ways to determine prevalence and that the CDC is considering a total population study of autism, but that it is not yet under way. Vanderbilt University's director of the Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum Disorders (TRIAD), believes the new data adds to what's already been known about ASD in other parts of the world -- that autism is not rare. But Dr. Zachary Warren, who did not participate in the study, also said, ""In the current study the authors sampled from a population, noted that many folks from this sample did not participate, and performed diagnostic evaluations on a relatively small number of children. As such, these concerns suggest interpreting the 2-3% prevalence rate reported with significant caution as it may in fact be an overestimate related to how they studied this specific community in Korea."" Dr. Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist at Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio, said the results of this study (which he also wasn't part of), suggest that what the numbers tell us is ""that (many) children in this district in Korea have difficulties with social/communications skills."" ""We have to be careful not to confuse them with other conditions that can also cause problems in these realms like ADHD and social anxiety disorders,"" he said. What makes Monday's study different from other autism studies is that researchers sought out children in regular schools. According to the researchers, few children in South Korea are put in special education classes. Grinker said about 10-12% of school children from K-12 classes receive some form of special needs education, but that in Korea that figure is far lower, maybe under 1%. He attributes that to a law that mandates inclusion, which makes it difficult to provide special education. Also, children in regular schools in Korea are in school for up to 12 hours a day, with highly structured, large classrooms, and few opportunities for socialization. Many of the children who were identified with an autism spectrum disorder through this study were found to have a higher IQ, but had poor socialization skills, one of the hallmarks of autism. ""I think many children with autism can do well in that highly structured situation and may not get flagged as having a particular problem,"" Grinker said. This may explain why many children with autism in South Korea may go unnoticed and may explain a significant difference with children in the United States. Dr. Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer of the advocacy group Autism Speaks, which funded part of the study, believes the most important finding is that the research shows that using ""the comprehensive sampling approach ... has the potential to yield an autism prevalence estimate that exceeds previous estimates."" Grinker believes the most important message from the study is not the numbers, but that it suggests that ""autism is more common than we previously thought and that, if we look hard enough, cases will be found and these children need treatment so they can thrive."" Dawson also believes that the study clearly confirms that autism is a significant global public health concern that transcends cultural, geographic and ethnic boundaries. It also shows that it's possible to translate and adopt screening and diagnostic approaches developed in English-speaking countries to effectively assess prevalence in other countries. Autism Speaks is funding similar research in India, South Africa, Mexico and Taiwan, Dawson said.","A new study estimates 1 in 38 South Korean children has some form of autism .

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Soccer has long been a bloody business in Argentina, but 2010 has proved particularly violent with five deaths linked to the so-called ""beautiful game."" Among the dead were two former bosses of hooligan gangs -- known locally as Barra Brava -- associated with clubs in the northern city of Rosario, but the most high-profile was policeman Sergio Rodriguez. Rodriguez was shot in the head as he tried to separate fighting fans of Estudiantes and Argentinos Juniors in the city of La Plata, according to Telam, the official Argentine government news agency. A solution has long been sought to end the bloodshed that for years has plagued Argentina's terraces, but when news emerged of a scheme to offer up to 500 of the country's most notorious hooligans free trips to the World Cup in South Africa, it was met with widespread criticism. When the government was implicated, that criticism turned to disbelief. The idea was the brainchild of a non-government organization called Hinchadas Unidas Argentinas (Argentine Fans United) who claimed the scheme would reduce violence by bringing fans together. The link with the government was seemingly given credence when prominent HUA figure Marcelo Mallo -- a man who previously campaigned for former Argentina president Nestor Kirchner, the husband of current incumbent Cristina -- claimed fans from the barra could become ""tools at the government's disposal"" through their activity with the NGO. Despite the appearance of banners calling for the re-election of Cristina Kirchner at prominent matches, the government steadfastly denied involvement by telling CNN there is ""no connection whatsoever."" However, prominent pressure group Salvemos al Futbol (Let's Save Football) -- a fans organization committed to increasing transparency and reducing violence in the game -- is convinced the government and the HUA are entwined. Mallo has been keeping a low profile after suggesting the HUA's offer of World Cup trips had a political motivation. But Emiliano Tagliarino, a spokesman for HUA, and a member of the Huracan barra told CNN: ""At one point we wanted to get close to the Kirchner government, but they didn't want to have anything to do with us. Politics doesn't interest us. I'm not looking to get elected. What interests us is stopping violence in football. ""Marcelo Mallo is not involved in every aspect of our organization. He is not there in the stands with us at the stadiums every week. He helps us with the legal side of things; he helped us secure our office. But the people who are in charge of HUA are us -- the fans like me."" Pablo Paladino, Undersecretary of the Argentina National Department of Football Security, was unequivocal when he spoke to CNN. ""There is absolutely no connection whatsoever between the hooligans and the state,"" he said. ""The Argentine government has never even considered the idea of sending members of the Argentine Fans United (HUA) to the World Cup in South Africa. ""I consider it impossible that any group except the government be in charge of guaranteeing security at football matches here. ""I really don't see how this group [HUA] can claim to be working to stopping violence when we see some of their members causing problems at the stadiums every week. What they say they want to do is one thing, but what we see them doing every weekend is different."" Mallo originally claimed that up to 500 football fans could benefit from the paid-for trips, but HUA now says between 80 and 100 fans are going and that ""each is paying his own way."" The confusion is a familiar scenario according to Monica Nizzardo, president of Salvemos al Futbol. She told CNN that her group was ""very concerned"" about HUA. ""The Argentinean government has given them a place in their political structure. One of HUA's leaders has been quite clear about that. ""The hooligans have always been involved in trouble at World Cups in various host countries. Why would we believe they'll behave now? They don't even do that here -- despite the pact they signed to get the trip in the first place. ""We are working with the relevant governmental organizations -- but unfortunately it doesn't really seem that there is a strong political will to tackle violence in football."" Paladino disagrees and says the government is now implementing ""technology"" that will allow it to better identify those who misbehave at football matches. He also pointed out that the government cannot employ the same measures to prevent known hooligans from traveling abroad for matches as countries like the UK can. He explained: ""In Argentina, the only way we can legally prevent a hooligan from traveling to South Africa is if a judge orders him detained or if he is already involved in a legal proceeding. But we don't have the authority to take away the passports of hooligans."" One person who has been enlisted by the government to help tackle the problem is behavioral scientist Otto Adang, chair of public order management for the Dutch Police academy. He has been working in Argentina for six years, but admits the complex nature of Argentinean football violence makes it a difficult beast to tame. He told CNN: ""We have to look at all the links -- the links between politicians and clubs and fans. Other interests are the money that is involved and the links that exist between different parties involved, which make the problem in Argentina much more complex. Argentina needs a tailor-made solution because it is a unique problem."" Adang did express his concerns over HUA's proposed World Cup deal, though. ""It doesn't sound like a very good idea at all,"" he said.","Argentine hooligans are being offered free trips to the World Cup in South Africa .
The deal is through an NGO who want a reduction in football violence in return .
Argentina's government has been linked but strenuously denies any involvement .
Pro-government banners have been visible at recent games in Argentina ."
"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Friends of a high-profile Chinese dissident found dead in his hospital room Wednesday slammed official claims that he hanged himself as ""insulting"" and ""ridiculous."" Huang Lihong told CNN that he had visited long-time labor rights activist Li Wangyang at Daxiang District Hospital in Shaoyang, Hunan province, a few days before his death on June 6. ""He was in good spirits... There was absolutely no sign showing he wanted to take his own life. He was also listening to my radio and told his sister to buy him one, too,"" Huang said. Li was blind, deaf and had trouble walking after spending more than 20 years in prison following the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989. He was one of China's first labor rights activists and was jailed shortly after the June 4 massacre for urging workers to strike, according to Human Rights in China (HRIC). After spending 11 years in jail, Li was released in 2000 only to be imprisoned again in 2001 for doggedly petitioning Shaoyang authorities to pay his medical expenses for injuries suffered through torture in prison. They refused and he was sentenced to a further 10 years for ""incitement to subvert state power,"" according to HRIC. He was released last May but his family said he had been under 24-hour police surveillance in hospital. ""It's unbelievable that he could hang himself. He's weak, couldn't really walk down from the second floor on his own,"" his friend Zhou Zhirong told CNN. Friends described a man who was unwavering in his determination to fight for his beliefs. ""It's an insult to say someone like him killed himself this way,"" Huang said. ""Li Wangyang said numerous times to me and others that he would keep fighting till the end of his life. He never quits. It's ridiculous even to think he would commit suicide and none of his friends or family believes what the police say now. He was killed by others for sure,"" he said. Li's brother-in-law Zhao Baozhu told HRIC that hospital staff phoned him and his wife, Li's sister Li Wangling, just after 6 a.m. on June 6 to tell them that Li had committed suicide. Zhao said they rushed to the hospital and found Li's body ""hanging by the window."" He noted that Li's feet were still on the ground. ""They [hospital staff] did not let us get near him, and did not let us take photos. Then they dragged his body away,"" HRIC said in statement on its website. ""I've never witnessed a suicide like this,""said Mi Ling Tsui, communications director at HRIC. ""It raises questions. How do you hang yourself with your feet on the ground?"" Despite the family's claims that they weren't allowed to take photos, three images of Li said to have been taken after his death have been published on Boxun, a U.S.-based Chinese-language news website. Two photos show Li standing by a window with a knotted sheet around his neck, apparently tied to bars on a window above. A third photo shows Li's feet firmly on the ground. He's still wearing slippers. CNN tried repeatedly to contact Daxiang District Hospital where Li died but no one answered the phone. An official who answered the phone at the publicity office of Shaoyang Public Security Station said he hadn't heard of Li's case and advised calling another number. Attempts to call other government offices also failed. It's not known how long Li had been in hospital before his death. HRIC said only that he was being treated for his ""deteriorating health."" Zhao told HRIC that authorities started monitoring Li on May 22. Friends said the phones of Li's sister Li Wangling and brother-in-law Zhao Baozhu don't appear to be working. They say they believe the couple has been detained in a hotel near the hospital where Li died. Earlier, Li's family and rights campaigners called for an immediate investigation and full autopsy to determine his cause of death. ""The Chinese authorities must thoroughly investigate the circumstances surrounding Li Wangyang's death and take seriously the claims made by his family and friends that this was not suicide,"" said Donna Guest, Asia Pacific Deputy Director at Amnesty International. In the hours after Li's death, a petition appeared online urging his ""suicide"" to be investigated by authorities outside Shaoyang province and for the findings to be made public. It was started by Hong Kong-based journalist Bei Feng, Chinese economist Xia Yeliang and literary scholar Wu Renhua. At the time of writing, more than 2,000 people had added their names, including many from who listed their locations China. Some entries written in Mandarin listed their location as ""hell."" Liu Jiayi of Hong Kong wrote: ""Comrade Li Wangyang, you perservered for more than 20 years, no one believes that you killed yourself! But now you can leave the domain of the Chinese Communist dictatorship. You are finally free! I wish you a good journey!"" Chen of Beijing wrote: ""Independently investigate and track down the true murderers. Let the world know who persecuted and murdered Li Wangyang, and bring them to trial."" Li's name recently appeared in a list of ""political prisoners"" who had been detained as of the end of 2011 in the U.S. Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. CNN's Shao Tian contributed to this report.","Friends of Chinese activist Li Wangyang slam suggestions he committed suicide .

"(CNN) -- Charlotte Bobcats owner and NBA legend Michael Jordan has been hit with a fine by the league for comments he made about the collective bargaining agreement which is currently under discussion. The NBA has been in lockout since July when the last collective bargaining agreement, a contract between the teams and the players association which outlines the rules regarding NBA star's pay, expired. The current dispute is centered around the average salary which should be earned by players over the term of their contract. Jordan, a six-time NBA champion and 14-time All Star as a player, broke league rules which prohibit the discussion of players or labor negotiations during the lockout in an interview with Australian newspaper The Herald Sun last month. The Hall of Famer described the current situation as ""broken"" and called for revenue to be shared more evenly between the NBA's 30 franchises. In addition, the 48-year-old also commented on Milwaukee Bucks center Andrew Bogut. ""The model we've been operating under is broken,"" Jordan told The Herald Sun in August. ""We have 22 or 23 teams losing money, I think we have got to come to some kind of understanding in this partnership that we have to realign. ""I know the owners are not going to move off what we feel is very necessary for us to get a deal in place where we can co-exist as partners. We need a lot of financial support throughout the league as well as revenue sharing to keep this business afloat. ""We have stars like Bogut who are entitled to certain type of demands. But for us to be profitable in small markets, we have to be able to win ballgames and build a better basketball team."" Bogut, 26, turned pro in 2005 and has been with the Bucks for the whole six years of his NBA career to date. Talks between the league and the players' union will recommence on Tuesday, with a string of meetings in Manhattan, Dallas and Las Vegas. As a result of the lockout, NBA players have turned their attention to Europe in an attempt to play competitive basketball. New Jersey Nets guard Deron Williams has signed a one-year deal with Turkish outfit Besiktas which will allow him to return to the U.S. once action resumes. Another player to have headed abroad is 25-year-old Sonny Weems, who has joined Lithuanian team Zalgiris Kaunas having played for the Toronto Raptors last season.","Michael Jordan has been hit with a fine by the NBA .

"(CNN) -- While forecasters predicted cooler days ahead for some of the United States, millions endured sizzling temperatures Saturday, with St. Louis marking its 10th consecutive day of 100 degrees and higher. A cold front was expected to bring much-needed relief in communities baking in a lingering heat wave. The front was to move across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes on Saturday, and into Ohio and the northeast the following day, bringing significantly cooler air, according to the National Weather Service. An excessive heat warning ended in the Chicago area. Despite the cold front, temperatures could remain high until Sunday. The heat wave has left scores dead and hundreds of thousands without power. Saturday's high of 107 in St. Louis broke a 103-degree mark set in 1936, said Butch Dye, hydrometeorologist technician for the National Weather Service. But conditions were expected to improve somewhat Sunday, with a high in the lower to mid-90s. Monday's expected 89 will match the normal high, said Dye. Temperatures topped 100 degrees Saturday in a swath stretching from south-central Iowa to the Chicago area to Louisville, Kentucky, to Virginia, the weather service said. Saturday's highs included 106 in Louisville; 105 in Lexington, Kentucky; 104 in Richmond, Virginia; 104 in Nashville, Tennessee; and 101 in Reading, Pennsylvania. A 4-month-old girl in Greenfield, Indiana, died after being left in a car for an ""extended period of time,"" police Chief John Jester said. While it wasn't clear how hot it had been inside the car, temperatures in that community of 20,000 people reached 103 degrees. The baby's grandfather found the young girl and rushed her to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Her father, Joshua Stryzinski, was later arrested and charged with neglect of a dependent, resulting in death. Jester said that charge may change after detectives meet with prosecutors. About 25 miles northwest in the town of Fishers, Meg E. Trueblood was arrested for felony neglect of a dependent after her 16-month-old unattended daughter was pulled from a car at a shopping center, police said. The toddler was rushed to the hospital in critical condition, said police spokesman Tom Weger. The temperature inside the vehicle was 124 degrees, said Weger, adding the baby was inside it for about one hour. An officer broke a window to reach the little girl. Fishers is just northeast of Indianapolis, where the thermometer hit 105 degrees. The heat wave is leaving a significant mark: Nationwide, there have been more than 4,500 daily record highs in the last 30 days, according to the National Climatic Data Center. Also, the heat has brought nearly 240 all-time record highs between June 23 and July 5, CNN meteorologist Alexandra Steele said Saturday. Triple-digit strategies for staying healthy . Forecasters said the cold front will help bring those numbers down some Sunday -- but at a cost. The front is expected to carry damaging storms, with large hail and strong winds, Steele said. ""It's relief at a price,"" Steele said. She predicted a long, hot summer for the country. ""Heat begets heat,"" Steele said. In Maryland, 10 heat-related deaths have been counted since Monday, said the state's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. All 10 victims were men, and all but two were more than 65 years old -- with the exceptions being between ages 45 and 64 -- the Maryland agency said. Five deaths were in Baltimore, two in Baltimore County, two in Montgomery County and one in Wicomico County, according to the department. Meanwhile, about 322,000 customers across 12 states and the District of Columbia suffered Saturday in the heat without the benefits of electricity, including power for their air conditioning and for refrigeration to keep their food edible, according to a CNN count Saturday evening. Because utilities typically define each residential and business account as a customer, the actual number of people affected was not clear. Many of these people have gone without power for a full week, thanks to strong storms fueled by the heat that barreled east from Indiana to New Jersey. Others have watched more recent but similar storms leave them in the dark. Gadgets to help you survive a power outage . The hardest-hit state continues to be West Virginia, where about 116,000 customers had no power Saturday. Residents have been stocking up on ice to try to save food from spoiling in their useless refrigerators to the point that stores have sold out of it, CNN affiliate WSAZ reported. Roger Harrah said he traveled from county to county, some 60 miles, searching for ice Friday and finally found a store with some. ""I thought I better get some while I can,"" Harrah said. ""I tell you what, it is rough living without ice."" The extreme heat has also damaged roads. Wisconsin received about 30 reports of roads buckling Thursday, according to transportation officials. Earlier this week, a viral video showed an SUV airborne after hitting a patch of buckled Wisconsin highway. Missouri has also warned drivers to be on the look-out for pavement buckling from heat. And since June 23, scores of cities have been the hottest they've ever been, on any day ever recorded. That includes 107 in Colorado Springs, 109 in Nashville and 106 in Atlanta. In Washington, the thermometer has gone past 95 degrees for nine straight days -- the longest such streak since modern record-keeping began. CNN's Michael Martinez, Phil Gast, Maggie Schneider and Monica O'Connor contributed to this report.","10 heat-related deaths are reported in Maryland alone .

"New York (CNN) -- Robert F. Kennedy's son, Douglas, faces misdemeanor charges over an incident at a New York hospital last month in which he knocked down a nurse while holding his newborn son, attorneys for both sides say. He was arraigned Thursday on harassment and child endangerment charges, both attorneys said. Kennedy -- a Fox News contributor -- was trying to take his newborn son for a walk ""to get fresh air"" outside Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, when two nurses intervened to prevent him from leaving, they said. Kennedy, who was accompanied by a hospital doctor, allegedly twisted the arm of one nurse to move her away from a door and kicked another after she approached him on January 7, according to Elliot Taub, the attorney for both nurses. The doctor who accompanied Kennedy, Timothy Haydock, was a longtime family friend, who said the nurses had initially agreed to let Kennedy take the baby outside. ""The nurses were the only aggressors,"" Haydock said in a statement delivered by Kennedy's attorney. But Taub said both nurses had not recognized Kennedy as the child's father and intended to protect the baby, who apparently had not been discharged. They were trying to enforce hospital rules, Taub said. Kennedy denied those allegations, saying ""the nurse had no right to grab our child out of his father's arms."" His attorney, Robert Gottlieb, said his client was ""calm and considerate"" and only became aggressive when the two nurses tried to take the baby. Gottlieb said one nurse said to Kennedy, "" 'Absolutely not,' and got very aggressive."" ""Dr. Haydock told the nurses he was going to go with (Kennedy),"" according to Gottlieb, who said the baby was wrapped in a blanket and had a cap on his head. ""He wasn't kidnapping him, obviously."" Gottlieb said one of the nurses then lunged for the baby. He said Kennedy then pushed the nurse with his knee, prompting the woman to fall backwards onto the hospital floor. Mount Kisco police not were immediately available for comment. The late Robert F. Kennedy was the younger brother of slain President John F. Kennedy and a former U.S. attorney general and U.S. senator. He was assassinated in 1968 while campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination.","Douglas Kennedy was arraigned Thursday on on misdemeanor charges .

"(CNN) -- Calling it a mission that may fundamentally change humanity's view of itself, NASA on Friday launched a telescope that will search our corner of the Milky Way galaxy for Earth-like planets. This image shows part of the Milky Way region of the sky where the Kepler spacecraft will be pointing. The Kepler spacecraft blasted into space on top of a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. ""This is a historical mission. It's not just a science mission,"" NASA Associate Administrator Ed Weiler said during a prelaunch news conference. ""It really attacks some very basic human questions that have been part of our genetic code since that first man or woman looked up in the sky and asked the question: Are we alone?"" Watch iReport video of launch . Kepler contains a special telescope that will stare at 100,000 stars in the Cygnus-Lyra region of the Milky Way for more than three years as it trails Earth's orbit around the Sun. The spacecraft will look for tiny dips in a star's brightness, which can mean an orbiting planet is passing in front of it -- an event called a transit.  Watch how astronomers will try to find 'Earths' Â» . The instrument is so precise that it can register changes in brightness of 20 parts per million in stars that are thousands of light years away. ""Being able to make that kind of a sensitive measurement over a very large number of stars was extremely challenging,"" Kepler project manager James Fanson said. ""So we're very proud of the vehicle we have built. This is a crowning achievement for NASA and a monumental step in our search for other worlds around other stars.""  See what the telescope looks like and which part of the galaxy it will monitor Â» . Are we alone? The $600 million mission is named after Johannes Kepler, a 17th-century German astronomer who was the first to correctly explain planetary motion. His discoveries combined with modern technology may soon help to answer whether we are alone in the universe or whether Earth-like worlds inhabited by some type of life are common. ""We won't find E.T., but we might find E.T.'s home,"" said William Borucki, science principal investigator for the Kepler mission. About 330 ""exoplanets"" -- those circling sun-like stars outside the solar system -- have been discovered since the first was confirmed in 1995. Most are gas giants like Jupiter, but some have been classified as ""super earths,"" or worlds several times the mass of our planet, said Alan Boss, an astronomer with the Carnegie Institution who serves on the Kepler Science Council. They are too hot to support life, he added, calling them ""steam worlds."" Europe's COROT space telescope caused a stir last month when it spotted the smallest terrestrial exoplanet ever found. With a diameter less than twice that of Earth, the planet orbits very close to its star and has temperatures up to 1,500Â° Celsius (more than 2,700Â° Fahrenheit), according to the European Space Agency. It may be rocky and covered in lava. Scientists have marveled how strange some of the alien worlds are. ""The density of these planets has been astounding,"" Borucki said. ""We're finding planets that float like a piece of foam on water, [with] very, very low densities. We're finding some planets where the densities are heavier than that of lead."" The Kepler telescope, however, is seeking something much more familiar: Earth-like planets with rocky surfaces, orbiting in their stars' habitable, or ""Goldilocks,"" zones -- not too hot or too cold, but just right for liquid water to exist.  Watch a NASA scientist explain where life could exist Â» . Quest for a 'pale blue dot' Once Kepler spots a planet, scientists will be able to calculate its size, mass, orbital period, distance from star and surface temperature, Boss said. He called the mission a ""step one"" that will tell astronomers how hard it is to find nearby habitable worlds. ""Once we know how many there really are ... then NASA will be able to build space telescopes that can actually go out and take a picture of that nearby 'Earth' and measure the elements and compounds in its atmosphere of the planet and give us some hint as to whether or not it's got life,"" Boss said. Boss believes that there may be 100 billion Earth-like planets in the Milky Way, or one for every sun-type star in the galaxy. He said scientists should know by 2013 -- the end of Kepler's mission -- whether life in the universe could be widespread. The 20-year goal is to someday take a picture of a pale blue dot orbiting a nearby star, said Debra Fischer, an astronomy professor at San Francisco State University, during a NASA news conference. Boss called it a potentially unprecedented time of discovery for scientists. ""Sometimes, people call this the golden age of astronomy. I think it's more like the platinum age of astronomy. It's beyond gold,"" Boss said.","NEW: Kepler spacecraft launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station late Friday .

"(CNN) -- Creativity has taken center stage in recent years, with a slew of books, articles and TED talks extolling the virtues of imagination and exhorting young and old to go out and exercise their creative muscle. In a 2010 IBM poll of CEOs worldwide, creativity was identified as the single most important leadership trait for success, enabling businesses to rise above an increasingly complex environment. The future belongs to ""creators and empathizers, pattern recognizers and meaning makers,"" declared author Daniel Pink in the introduction to his best-selling book ""A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future."" Creativity also matters to our emotional well-being as we find our way in an uncertain, rapidly shifting world. Imagination underpins our ability to remain resilient during difficult and stressful times since creative people tend to be more tolerant of ambiguity and better able to come back from defeat. And yet, despite its growing importance, creativity suffers from an odd sort of paradox. According to psychologist and Wharton management professor Jennifer Mueller, research shows that even as people explicitly aspire to creativity and strongly endorse it as a fundamental driving force of positive change, they routinely reject creative ideas and show an implicit bias against them under conditions of uncertainty. Subjects in Mueller's study also exhibited a failure to see or acknowledge creativity, even when directly presented with it. It would appear that we suffer from a bias against creativity. But we are in denial about it, possibly because of what it may say about us. ""Because there is such a strong social norm to endorse creativity, and people also feel authentic positive attitudes toward creativity, people may be reluctant to admit that they do not want creativity; hence, the bias against creativity may be particularly slippery to diagnose,"" Mueller and her colleagues suggest. Why the bias? ""Creativity is doing something differently than you've done before,"" says Beau Lotto, a neuroscientist and founder of Lottolab, a hybrid art studio and science lab. From an evolutionary standpoint, uncertainty was a bad thing. ""If you weren't sure that there was a tiger in front of you, by the time you were sure it was too late,"" Lotto observes. ""Our brains thus evolved to take uncertainty and make it certain."" Mueller says, ""We are intolerant of uncertainty in general. The more creative something is, the more novel it is. And the more novel it is, the greater the uncertainty we are likely to have about its feasibility."" These negative associations tend to be unacknowledged, and there is evidence that they are unconscious, as in the case of executives who demand creativity but continue to reject creative ideas. Herein, however, lies the dilemma: Creativity is what we need to help us get through times of greatest uncertainty and difficulty. And it's exactly during those times, perhaps when we need it most, that we are least likely to embrace creativity. Imagination scares us because it demands a foray into the unknown. ""But only by going into a space of uncertainty can we do anything new,"" Lotto says. ""That is a tremendous challenge, isn't it?"" Another reason for the bias against creativity may be the perception that something can either be creative or practical, but that much more rarely can it be both. Many (and perhaps even most) people hold the belief that for every success story such as Steve Jobs, the ""patron saint of the creative class,"" there are thousands (or more) chronically unemployed and underemployed ""artists."" This belief gives rise to a duality, where practical and creative endeavors lead largely separate existences -- one slogged at during the workweek and the other indulged on nights and weekends, or dismissed as a luxury. The creativity versus practicality dissonance also manifested in aspects of Mueller's research. She refers to the two separate mind-sets of the ""why"" people and the ""how"" people. People focused on ""why"" tend to frame the world in more abstract ways. In general, they don't tend to have feasibility concerns. Those who are in a ""how"" mind-set, however, are so focused on feasibility that they are likely to overlook or dismiss creative ideas. ""Most boardrooms are all 'how,' and the 'why' is crushed,"" Mueller says. ""This is why Steve Jobs was so remarkable. He had a solid grasp of the 'why' and was also able to overcome objections to the 'how.' He was able to overcome the reality distortion field."" The folly of seeking certainty . There are a number of problems with our obsession with creating certainty, and the most important is that certainty does not exist. ""Certainty is an illusion! A delusion!"" Lotto says. Or, as Clint Eastwood once said: ""If you want a guarantee, buy a toaster."" The second problem is that the more we seek to create tools to make life predictable -- from packaged foods to Starbucks, GPS devices to smartphones, Yelp to Trip Advisor -- the more we diminish aspects of our brains capable of dealing with the unexpected. ""Technology is an amazing empowerment and a huge disablement,"" says Laura Richardson, principal designer at frog design. ""We are losing our capacity for resilience."" Richardson is a big believer in the ""MacGyver"" manifesto. (MacGyver, of course, was the ever-resourceful television character who was able to solve complex problems with duct tape, paper clips and any other material he found handy.) ""I remember being locked out of the house once when I was growing up,"" Richardson says. ""I found an old ruler, somehow prodded up the window latch and got in. It was an amazing sense of accomplishment."" She says some of our best stories are about those times when we were forced into something and had to use ingenuity to find our way out. Richardson says she believes that the future favors the flexible. She quotes MAKE magazine founding editor Dale Dougherty, honored by the White House as a Champion of Change, who wrote: ""Our future security lies in knowing what we are capable of creating and how we can adapt to change by being resourceful."" Becoming comfortable with uncertainty . Is it possible to overcome our inclination toward the predictable? Mueller notes an important exception to our avoidance of the unknown. Research shows that the framing of uncertainty changes the way people react. ""We don't mind uncertainty when it's associated with something positive, like hope,"" she says. ""Frame something positively, and people will behave differently."" David Kelley, founder of the design firm IDEO, observes, ""Creativity is being comfortable with having ideas and not fearing being judged when you put your ideas out there."" Kelley, recognized as one of America's leading design innovators, is passionate about democratizing creativity by helping people develop creative confidence. He's not, however, teaching people how to be creative. ""They are inherently creative,"" Kelley says. ""All we are doing is taking away the blocks."" Those blocks form early, according to Kelley. Though young children are naturally and unabashedly creative, they either opt out of thinking of themselves as creative or have it hammered out of them in elementary school. ""A kind of atrophy sets in, when they start to trust their analytical minds but not their intuitive minds."" Removing those blocks has a great deal to do with fear. He suggests approaching the fear of creativity the same way you would approach any other kind of phobia, such as the fear of heights or snakes. Kelley finds that creative confidence carries over into other aspects of people's lives -- in the way they solve problems, sing karaoke, throw dinner parties. ""Once you have done something dangerous and succeeded, you try it in other places. And you begin to learn how to synthesize your experience and intuition to make complex and important decisions."" With the challenges we are facing, we need to rethink what creativity means, Richardson says. We need to expand what we mean by creative. Creativity is not just about painting or drawing or art. It is about problem-solving. It's the flexibility of your mind, the ability to see things that no one can see and envision something entirely different. We are creating the future, bringing about change. And there is something incredibly empowering about that.","People routinely reject and show bias against creative ideas, Amanda Enayati says .

"Washington (CNN) -- ""Worthy of trust and confidence"" is the motto of the almost 150-year-old U.S. Secret Service, and Director Mark Sullivan now faces the dual task of proving it true and keeping his job. A scandal involving allegations of partying with prostitutes in Colombia shortly before President Barack Obama's arrival last week for the Summit of the Americas has forced a rare spotlight on the internal workings of an agency labeled as secret. Sullivan, a Secret Service veteran for almost three decades who was sworn in as director on May 31, 2006, is the focus of demands by the White House and Congress -- and a perplexed American public -- to figure out exactly what happened. At issue is how 11 agents ended up in a potentially compromising situation in violation of agency standards. More important are questions raised about whether it was a lone incident or indicative of a culture far removed from the legendary discipline and integrity exuded by the agency. So far, three Secret Service members are leaving over the scandal -- one forced out, one retiring and one resigning -- and more resignations are expected. While one member of Congress has called for Sullivan's ouster, other influential legislators and officials quickly defended his initial steps in dealing with the scandal. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Thursday that Obama has ""faith in the director (and) confidence in his leadership,"" adding: ""We are not going to prejudge outcomes and discuss the future of this agency in a press briefing while this investigation is going on."" ""The fact of the matter is this is an incident that requires investigation,"" Carney said. ""The Secret Service has acted with speed in addressing the matter, investigating the matter, holding people accountable, and continuing to push forward with the investigation."" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Pat Leahy, D-Vermont, said he has been in close touch with Sullivan and believes the agency director is taking ""serious action"" to investigate the incident, while House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, said he has a high level of confidence in Sullivan. Steps taken so far include bringing home the agents involved, stripping them of their security clearance and questioning that has included at least one polygraph exam. In addition, sources said Sullivan wants to form an outside panel to examine if the Cartagena incident reflected a problem of wrongdoing embedded in agency culture. ""He's outraged by this,"" CNN National Security Contributor Fran Townsend said of Sullivan after talking to him. Rather than making Sullivan the target or fall guy, members of Congress want to give him the opportunity to investigate it and bring in outsiders to look at the agency culture, Townsend said Thursday. Despite their initial praise, legislators made clear they need more answers. Issa and the ranking Democrat on the oversight committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, sent Sullivan a letter demanding comprehensive information on the incident. Cummings told CNN of a conversation he had with Sullivan on Wednesday -- before the departures of the initial three Secret Service agents were announced -- that explained the culture of pride permeating the Secret Service. ""I could tell that he was very upset, and probably more upset than a lot of the people on (in Congress) can be,"" Cummings said Thursday. ""... I asked him a question. I said, 'Look, I get the impression that there's a culture of pride, of excellence, of being the best.' I said, ""Is it possible that these men might resign?' He said he had absolutely no doubt that they would."" Cummings continued: ""They have this pride they don't want any bad apples and so it probably would be so uncomfortable to them that they would leave. So, yesterday's actions with regard to folks leaving and being fired did not surprise me one bit."" To Congress and the nation, the Secret Service symbolizes the highest level of protective security. Most visible are the agents who guard the president and vice president, familiar to the public by their sunglasses and earphones and through films such as ""In The Line Of Fire"" starring Clint Eastwood in 1993 and ""Guarding Tess"" a year later with Shirley MacLaine and Nicolas Cage. The Secret Service was created as a division of the U.S. Treasury on July 5, 1865, to suppress counterfeit currency. It quickly expanded to take on the Ku Klux Klan, moonshiners and others ""perpetrating fraud against the government,"" according to the Secret Service website www.secretservice.gov. The agency assumed responsibility for protecting the president in 1902, and its role continued to expand in ensuing decades. When the Department of Homeland Security was created after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Secret Service moved over from Treasury. Sullivan has an exemplary record with the Secret Service, rising up through the ranks and receiving the Distinguished Presidential Rank Award in 2005 and 2010, the website said. Born in Arlington, Massachusetts, Sullivan graduated from Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire and joined the Secret Service as a special agent in Detroit in 1983. Among his assignments were stints in the fraud division and the presidential protective division before becoming a supervisor. The Colombia scandal is not the first public problem encountered under Sullivan's direction. In 2009, a couple got into a White House state dinner without invitations, embarrassing the Secret Service. While the agency had ultimate responsibility for security that night, the problem was eventually attributed more to a White House failure to check invitations. Sullivan's challenge now is to make sure that the agency's reputation of excellence as an elite force continues, Cummings said. ""It's just not what happened here, but it's even the appearance that that organization could be pierced,"" he said. ""We don't even want people to even be thinking that that's possible. And so they've got to re-establish trust, and they also have to make sure that any holes they may find, any weakness, will be filled.""
