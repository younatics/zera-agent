You may have thought recruitment to MI6 was wrapped in a veil of secrecy – involving mysterious brown envelopes or a tap on the shoulder. But the Secret Intelligence Service has decided to take the more traditional approach of advertising in a national newspaper. The tongue-in-cheek advert, taken out in The Sunday Times, rubbishes the notion of James Bond-style  ‘high-speed chases and shoot-outs’, instead saying the qualities looked for are ‘far more ordinary’. Working for MI6 is not all about James Bond-style high speed chases or shoot outs according to a recruitment advert in The Sunday Times . It even suggests that while MI6 does have an ‘international focus’ many  of its jobs are based in London and  ‘fit well with family life’. The advert also states that spies often need more ‘subtle’ qualities, such as ‘the simple ability to get on with all sorts of people from all kinds of cultures’. In a reference to John le Carre’s novel Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, the ad also pokes fun at the ‘Tinker, Tailor image of the hyper-intelligent, slightly, dysfunctional oddball’. Dismissing the stereotype, the Secret Service says that ‘in fact, you’ll find that we value both emotional intelligence and academic achievement’. In the full-page advertisement,, MI6 also dismisses the ‘white, male stereotype’, instead saying ‘the truth is we don’t care what sex you are or where you’re from, as long as you’re a British national’. Bosses also opened the job up to as many candidates as possible, saying that they ‘don’t care what you do now, only what you can do’. Gary Oldman as George Smiley in the 2011 film Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy - The ad pokes fun at the ¿Tinker, Tailor image of the hyper-intelligent, slightly, dysfunctional oddball' But while the campaign is one of MI6’s most open recruitment drives, it still emphasises the need for secrecy, telling possible candidates that they cannot discuss their application with anybody. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said that the campaign is ‘designed to attract people from a wide variety of backgrounds who have the skills we are looking for, but for various reasons may not have considered a career in MI6’. The spokesman added: ‘It is crucial that we continue to protect British interests both at home and abroad, so we need to ensure that we have the right skills and capability to do that. ‘As people move on from the Service, it is important that we continue to ensure talented people consider the Service as a career.’ Earlier this month, MI5, the UK’s internal security agency, announced that it was seeking to hire as many as 100 recruits as young as 18 to ‘take a degree in spying’ instead of going to university. MI5 bosses also sought to expel the ‘myth’ that a career in the intelligence services is ‘the preserve of privately educated men’. The Foreign Office said it wanted to harness the talents of the ‘XBox generation’ who have grown up with social networking sites, global internet connections and interactive gaming.","The tongue-in cheek advert taken out in The Sunday Times rubbishes the notion of James Bond-style 'high speed chases and shoot-outs'

An angry father has criticised a school after his eight-year-old son was ordered to wear a fluorescent yellow jacket as a dunce hat-style punishment for misbehaving in class. Abdullah Al-Ameen was ordered to wear the high visibility jacket for three weeks after he was told off for throwing leaves at other pupils who had been bullying him. Furious dad Dr Sanaa Al-Ameen, 59, slammed staff at Forest Fields Primary School in Nottingham - accusing them of making his son wear the equivalent of 'a dunce’s cap'. Humiliated: Abdullah Al-Ameen (left) was forced to wear a fluorescent yellow jacket (file picture right) as a punishment for three weeks. His father Dr Sanaa Al-Ameen (left) said he was shocked by the punishment from Forest Fields Primary school . Sanaa, a retired lecturer at Nottingham University, said: 'It’s like making him wear a dunce’s cap. It’s unacceptable and demeaning for my son. 'There have been times when he doesn’t want to go to school and has been pretending to be ill and it’s because of the jacket. 'I am shocked - this is not the way to treat an eight-year-old and I am sure it is more disruptive to have him wear this jacket.' He said Abdullah was made to wear the jacket after he stuffed leaves down the shirts of children who had bullied him. Humiliated Abdullah, who is the youngest of five children, said: 'I don’t like going to school because I have to wear the jacket. Punishment: Forest Fields Primary and Nursery School in Nottingham make students who misbehave wear a fluorescent jacket as a punishment . 'It makes me feel nervous when I wear it because I know other people are looking at me.' After his son came home in floods of tears after being tormented about wearing the jacket, Dr Al-Ameen demanded the school, which caters for 470 pupils aged 3-11, scrap the punishment policy. But headteacher Sue Hoyland, defended the move - claiming it shames pupils into behaving. She said: 'We have been trialling the scheme of jackets and we have seen improvements in some children’s behaviour. 'They are in no way used to shame the children or to make them look as if they are doing community service. 'When children’s behaviour falls below standards, we are keen to see this change by rewarding children when they make the right decision. Slammed: Parents believe humiliating students is not the right form of punishment . 'With the jackets, the teachers know who to give praise to and reward more.' But parents at the school are demanding the punishment jackets are axed. Dad-of-three John Taylor, 40, whose eight-year-old son attends the school, said: 'The school should be able to control pupil behaviour with words rather than shaming them. 'This policy actually encourages pupils to bully and pick on those who are different, it’s a backward approach which should be stopped immediately.'","Boy forced to wear bright jacket for three weeks by teachers .

Astronomers have called for help in finding 'space warps', rare system that bend light around them, acting as giant lenses. More commonly known as 'gravitational lenses,' they create beautiful mirages, and help give clues to how dark matter helped form the universe. Astronomers have now set up a special site where amateurs can scour images of the sky looking for the strange occurrences. Scroll down for video . UFO! This quasar has been lensed into four images, arranged around the galaxy, by a space warp. This is called the Einstein cross configuration bu astronomers . Visitors to www.spacewarps.org are . given examples of what space warps look like and are shown how to mark . potential candidates on each image. After identifying possible . candidates in images, participants can discuss them via an . online forum with other volunteers and experts, and create computer . models of their discoveries. The final collection of space-warp . candidates will be published for both amateur and expert astronomers to . investigate further. Anyone can participate in Space Warps project at the www.spacewarps.org site. 'Not only do space warps act like lenses, magnifying the distant galaxies behind them, but also the light they distort can be used to weigh them, helping us to figure out how much dark matter they contain and how it’s distributed,' said Dr. Phil Marshall, co-leader of the project at the University of Oxford. The first set of sky images to be inspected in the project is from the CFHT (Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope) legacy survey. 'We have scanned the images with computer algorithms, but there are likely to be many more space warps that the algorithms have missed. 'Realistically simulated space warps are dropped into some images to train volunteers to spot them and reassure people that they are on the right track,' said Dr. Anupreeta More, co-leader of the project at the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the universe (Kavli IPMU), the University of Tokyo. Previous studies have shown that the human brain is much better at identifying lenses than current computer algorithms, and members of the public are as good at spotting astronomical objects as experts. This is a bright blue 'quasi-stellar object' behind a massive galaxy: it has been lensed into two images, one on either side of the lens galaxy . The image configuration in this case is a quad, with two images very close together . 'Even if individual visitors only spend a few minutes glancing over 40 or so images each, that’s really helpful to our research -- we only need a handful of people to spot something in an image for us to say that it’s worth investigating,' said Dr. Aprajita Verma, another co-leader from the University of Oxford. Following the CFHT legacy survey, other surveys will also be using Space Warps as a means to find lens systems in their data. For example, the Dark Energy Survey led by the United States and the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey led by Japan are interested in collaborating with Space Warps, too.","Amateur astronomers can scour special website for odd effects .

Nasa's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will arrive at the asteroid Bennu in 2018 with the aim of collecting cosmic samples to return to Earth. Scientists hope the mission will accelerate technology that will enable humans to mine asteroids for precious metals . For instance, something called an ‘S-type’ asteroid could . contain significant amounts of metal including iron, nickel and cobalt, as well . as trace elements such as gold, platinum and rhodium. ‘A small, 10-meter S-type asteroid contains about 1,433,000 . pounds (650,000 kg) of metal, with about 110 pounds (50 kg) in the form of rare . metals like platinum and gold,’ said Dante Lauretta of the University of .

The problem is it currently costs hundreds of millions and . sometimes billions of pounds to build and launch a space mission. Another obstacle is the lack of experience in mapping and . analysing the resources in asteroids to extract material from them. The OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource . Identification, Security and Regolith Explorer) mission aims to gain this . experience. The spacecraft, scheduled for launch in September 2016, will . arrive at the asteroid Bennu in October 2018 and study it in detail before . returning with a sample of material from its surface. VIDEO:  An artist's concept of how NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will explore asteroid Bennu, take a sample, and return it to Earth for analysis . Its primary purpose is scientific - since asteroids are . relics from our solar system's formation, analysis of the sample is expected to . give insights into how the planets formed and life originated. The spacecraft will also measure how the push from sunlight . alters the orbit of Bennu, to help understand the risk of asteroids impacting . Earth. Nasa has designed triple redundancy into the mission- if the . first attempt fails, the team can try two more times to get at least 60 grams . of sample, and up to 2,000 grams. ‘The mission will be a proof-of-concept – can you go to an . asteroid, get material, and bring it back to Earth?’ said Mr Lauretta. ‘Next, people will have to industrialise it so that the . economy works out, so for the recoverable value in any given asteroid, you're . spending half that to bring it back.’ A computer generated image of swarms of low-cost robotic spacecraft that will enable extraction of resources from asteroids.

Last year a team of scientists, with the backing of Google . and Hollywood film maker James Cameron, unveiled plans for a private space . venture that would mine asteroids. The company, called Planetary Resources, is initially focusing . on developing and selling extremely low-cost robotic spacecraft for surveying . missions. Within five to 10 years, however, it expects to progress . from selling observation platforms in orbit around Earth to prospecting . services. It plans to tap some of the thousands of asteroids that pass . relatively close to Earth and extract their raw materials. Not all missions would return precious metals and minerals . to Earth.

One single asteroid in our solar system - 241 Germania - has $95.8 (£60) trillion of mineral wealth inside it - nearly the same as the annual GDP of the entire world. This is according to Asterank, a website based on publicly available information that aims to catalogue the enormous wealth in the solar system, and also how little is currently known about what lies out there. The site has based most of its estimates - graphing profitability against accessibility - on information from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Information on what is actually inside asteroids is much thinner on the ground - hence Planetary Resources aims to spend much of its early budget on scanners to work out what's out there.The site's charts weigh up how easy it is to get to an asteroid versus how much wealth there is there - often minerals such as platinum, but in the case of 241 Germanium, hydrocarbons such as oil.The site was founded by student Ian Webster, using publicly available data.","OSIRIS-REx will launch in 2016 and arrive at the asteroid Bennu .

A visit by the biggest cruise liner to ever enter the Italian lagoon city of Venice sparked anger among campaigners who claimed the ship blocked views and polluted the air. The 140,000 tonne MSC Divinia swept past St Mark's Square on Saturday while protestors on the shoreline waved banners which read 'No Big Ships'. The liner which can carry more than 4,500 people is named in honour of screen legend Sophia Loren and was christened by the Italian star last month in Marseille. Looming presence: The huge MSC Divina dwarfs the historic domes of Venice during its controversial visit to the lagoon city on Saturday . The protesters, who belong to the No Big Ships Venice Committee have written an open letter to Ms Loren calling on her to ditch her endorsement of the monster ship. The group wrote: 'We can't believe that you want your name, which is a legend in Italy and the world, to be associated with a ship that contributes to the destruction of Venice, part of humanity's heritage. 'We are asking you to give up your role as godmother of the ship. Venice and the world would see that as a divine gesture. Venice belongs to the world. Help us save it.' Looming presence: The huge MSC Divina dwarfs buildings as it leaves Venice after just its stop which sparked protests in the lagoon city . Historic: Protesters from the No Big Ships Venice Committee are angry the 140,000 tonne ship was able to enter Venice claiming it is far too big . Contrast: The 333m long MSC Divina passes in front a gondola station in St Mark's Square on Saturday amid claims it is far to big to enter Venice without damaging the fragile lagoon city . Since the wreck of the Costa Concordia in January, environmentalists have stepped up their efforts to have large cruise ships banned from the lagoon which surrounds the historic centre of the canal city. The Concordia capsized off the coast of the Tuscan island of Giglio after it hit rocks. At least 30 people were killed and two are still unaccounted for. Open letter: Italian actress Sophia Loren (pictured in 2010) is being called on to reverse her endorsement for the MSC Divinia . That disaster put the spotlight on the Venice lagoon, one of Italy's most delicate maritime area. Big cruise ships enter the city to drop off passengers conveniently close to the historic centre and the Grand Canal. The letter to Ms Loren said the big ships pollute the air and their vibrations and the lapping waves caused by the wakes of their passage hurt the foundations of historic palaces and churches. The letter said: 'Venice and its lagoon are both world heritage sites and risk an environmental disaster every day because of the passage of these monsters of the sea.' Italia Nostra (Our Italy), the country's leading conservation group has also long been opposing the entry of large cruise ships into the lagoon. The Divina has a first-class suite named after Loren which is decorated with large pictures of the Oscar-winning actress at various stages of her film career. The liner, which is 330m long and features 1,739 cabins, has a top traveling speed of 23.7 knots. On board the luxurious new ship there are lifts for passengers, an infinity pool, restaurants, casino and disco. Silvio Testa, the campaign group's spokesman, said to The Independent his biggest concern was pollution from the huge vessel. He said: 'This thing produces the same amount of pollution in an hour as 15,000 cars. 'Not only that - the pollution contains 15 times as much sulpher as car fumes. That's why we want this huge vessel banned from the lagoon.' Following the Concordia disaster the Italian government banned the close approach of vessels weighing more than 40,000 tonnes. But liner companies taking passengers to Venice are able to get around the ban because alternative routes in and out of the main port do not exist. Historic: The huge MSC Divina swept passed St Mark's Square as it brought tourists on the cruise liner into Venice's famous lagoon on Saturday .

Tragic: Emma Smith was walking with her dog Bell in a field when she was knocked to the ground and repeatedly sat on by cows . A midwife is in hospital after she was stamped on, thrown and sat on by a herd of cows while walking her dog. Emma Smith suffered serious chest wounds and crushed ribs in the attack as the cows tried to protect their young calves. The 38-year-old was crossing a field when her dog disturbed a herd of cows and their offspring. Miss Smith tripped and fell as the animals chased her and the cows then took turns to sit and roll on her. More cows then joined the attack near St Martin, on the Lizard peninsula in Cornwall, barging Miss Smith from behind as she tried to get up and leaving her drenched in blood. She managed to crawl under an electric fence to escape and was airlifted to hospital where she is still recovering a month after the ordeal. Doctors say she will take at least a year to recover and may never work again. Yesterday Miss Smith warned the public to stay away from cows. She said: ‘I’ve never seen cows act like that before – this must never happen to anyone else again.’ Miss Smith moved to Cornwall from Shrewsbury the weekend before she was attacked to start a job as a midwife at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro. She took her dog, Bell, for a walk on a short lead using a familiar route near her parents’ home. Miss Smith began to cross a field of cattle on a public right of way but soon found herself surrounded by a herd of cows. Emma, 38, was crossing a field near St Martin, Cornwall, when her dog disturbed a herd and their young calves . Her mother Susan Moody explained: ‘Emma assessed the situation and said the cows looked up but took no notice of her or her dog. ‘She was just over halfway across the field when a cow started to run towards her, followed by many others. ‘The cows weren’t going to stop. One charged from behind and she was tossed in the air. ‘She managed to get up after this but she was charged yet again, from the front this time. ‘After she regained consciousness, she . became aware different cows were dropping themselves on top of her – . presumably with the intention of crushing her. She managed to crawl away . between episodes of unconsciousness.’ Shocking: The young midwife managed to crawl across the field in between bouts of unconsciousness .

Variant CJD is an incurable disease . believed to be caused by exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy . (BSE) which affects cattle. The . vast majority of cases are caused by consuming beef contaminated with . BSE. Contaminated meat contains an abnormal protein called a prion.

Symptoms include memory loss, balance . and coordination problems, slurred speech, visual problems and . blindness, abnormal jerking movements, progressive deterioration and . immobility. Most people with vCJD will die within a year of the . symptoms starting, usually from infection. This is because the . immobility caused by vCJD can make patients vulnerable to infection. There . is currently no cure for vCJD so treatment involves helping to relieve . symptoms and making a patient feel as comfortable as possible. This can . include using medication such as antidepressants to improve mood and . painkillers to relieve pain. Assistance with feeding may also be . required.

'I think if you’re just going to sit about and be sad, what’s the point in going on anyway?' A few months ago Mr Kara was forced to give up his job as a barman at the Queen’s Arms pub, Brighton, where he also performed as a drag queen.

Now Mr Kara is now organising a charity event to raise awareness of CJD and money for the National CJD Research and Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh. 'It’s for the future because they have got to find a cure for it one day and any money we raise is surely going to make a positive difference,' he added. What is vCJD? Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is a neurdegenerative condition and the human equivalent of Mad Cow Disease or Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). How is it transmitted to humans? The vast majority of cases are caused by consuming beef contaminated with BSE. Contaminated meat contain an abnormal protein called a prion. Prions accumulate at high levels in the brain and cause irreversible damage to nerve cells.

Antibiotic and antiviral medicines have no effect on prions. A government inquiry in 2000 concluded that the prion was spread through . cattle that were fed meat-and-bone mix containing traces of infected . brains or spinal cords. The prion then ended up in processed meat . products, such as beef burgers, and entered the human food chain. Is eating beef still risky? Strict . controls have been in place since 1996 to prevent BSE from entering the . human food chain and the use of meat-and-bone mix has since been . outlawed. How common is CJD? Between 1996 to March 2011, 175 cases of vCJD were reported in the UK and 49 cases in other countries from October. Following the successful containment of the BSE epidemic in cattle, the number of cases of vCJD in the United Kingdom has declined since 2000. There were only five confirmed deaths in . 2011. Some experts believe that the food controls have worked and that . further cases of vCJD will continue to decline. As of January 2012 there . were no patients with vCJD, but this does not rule out the possibility . that other cases may be identified in future. There is considerable uncertainty about how many people in the UK population are incubating vCJD. A . recent study based on random tissue samples suggested that around 1 in . 4,000 might be infected with vCJD, but show no symptoms to date. What are the symptoms? Symptoms include memory loss, balance and co-ordination problems, slurred speech, visual problems and blindness, abnormal jerking movements, progressive deterioration and immobilityMost people with vCJD will die within a year of the symptoms starting, usually from infection. This is because the immobility caused by vCJD can make patients vulnerable to infection. Is there a treatment or cure?There is currently no cure for vCJD so treatment involves helping to relieve symptoms and making a patient feel as comfortable as possible. This can include using medication such as antidepressants to improve mood and painkillers to relieve pain. Assistance with feeding may also be required.","Ritchii Kara, from Brighton, was diagnosed with Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease last August and was given just 14 months to live .

Tom Cruise, Daniel Radcliffe, Jack Black, Seth Green and Macauley Culkin should probably visit their nearest Cuban heel outlet the next time they're interested in wooing a lady friend. The vast majority of women say a man 'wouldn't stand a chance' in the love stakes if they were under 6ft in height, and 'would struggle' to get their attention... despite the average height of the British man being just 5ft 10ins, two inches below a 'perfect' height. And although men are getting there (slowly but surely), having shot up by four inches in the past 100 years, 71 per cent of females still say the ideal height for a male partner is between 6ft and 6ft 6ins, according to a new poll. Kate Holmes towers above her ex-husband Tom Cruise (5ft 7ins), left, and her co-presenter Danielle Radcliffe (5ft 5ins), right . Meanwhile, the average height of women in the UK is 5ft 4ins - just one-and-half inches more than 100 years ago. And as far as men are concerned, 45 per cent would . date a woman taller than them - if she would have them - and 49 per cent . said the ideal woman was between 5ft 7ins and 5ft 10ins tall, according to the study of 1,400 British women by men's big and tall brand High And Mighty. Of these women, 71 per cent want their man between 6ft and 6ft 6ins, 26 per cent between 5ft 7ins to 5ft 11ins, and three per cent between 6ft 6ins and 6ft 11ins. A total of 63 per cent also said they thought that 'taller men' were sexier than smaller men - mirroring Hollywood's penchant for taller leading men such as 6ft 3ins tall Thor star Chris Hemsworth and 6ft 3ins tall Transformers star Josh Duhamel. Jack Black, 5ft 6ins, promoting Shallow Hal with his co-star Gwyneth Paltrow in 2001, left, and actor Seth Green, 5ft 4ins - but neither of them need worry as they are both already married . Women also said they believe that 'short man syndrome' or 'small man's inferiority complex' - also called the Napolean complex after the famous emperor Napolean Bonaparte, who was 5ft 6ins tall - really does exist, with 62 per cent saying smaller men had an inferiority complex linked to their height. A total of 33 per cent of women polled said they believed tall men were happier than short men. Women were also asked which factors were 'most important in a man', with the top answer being a sense of humour, followed by kindness, height, grooming, physique, fashion sense and hair. The poll found that 72 per cent of men were 'happy with their height', with the most ideal height listed as 6ft by 23 per cent, 6ft 2ins by 17 per cent, and 6ft 3ins by 10 per cent. Some 54 per cent of men polled said they thought 'height made no difference to their attractiveness'. Sally Smith, 32, of Birmingham, said: 'I'm 5ft 8ins and my ex-boyfriend was only 5ft 7ins. After a while I got a bit sick of looking down on him and never being able to wear heels, so after a year I gave him the push.' The accounts worker added: 'I'm now dating a man who is 6ft 2ins, and now I can wear whatever kind of shoes I want without feeling like I'm towering over by boyfriend.' Women also said they believe that 'short man syndrome' or 'small man's inferiority complex' - also called the Napolean complex after the famous emperor Napolean Bonaparte, who was 5ft 6ins tall - really does exist . Psychologist Portia Hickey said: 'Psychological research has found that women tend to describe their ideal man as taller than average. 'Women's attraction to taller men is likely to be driven by both evolution and positive stereotypes about tall men. 'Women are likely to associate a tall man with higher social and professional status as well as reproductive potential, making them seem more attractive.'","Tom Cruise, Daniel Radcliffe, Seth Green and Jack Black are all below 6ft .

For a lot of football fans, they have a specific shirt they wear on game days - a game-day shirt to show support for their team. But for a Wisconsin 6th grader, his game-day shirt is his EVERY day shirt. David Pehl, of Holmen, is a die-hard Green Bay Packers fan and his favorite player is quarterback Aaron Rodgers. So, when David received an Aaron Rodgers jersey for Christmas a few years ago, he started wearing it every day. That was 1,035 days ago - and he's worn it every day since. Super fan: David Pehl has worn his Aaron Rodgers jersey every day for the last 1,035 days . Hero: Aaron Rodgers helped the Packers win the 2010 Super Bowl - right around the time David Pehl got his jersey . 'Everyone asks, ''Is he still wearing the shirt?'' Yes, he's still wearing the shirt,' his mother, Jessica Pehl, told WKBT. Now, David is trying to break the record for most consecutive days wearing a Packers jersey. 'I made the mistake of mentioning the boy that had worn the Brett Favre . jersey just over four years and at that point he said, ''Hm, is there a . record?'' and I said, ''I don't know if there's a record for an Aaron . Rodgers jersey,'' so he said, ''Well, I'm going to try and break the . record,'"" his father, Dave, says. The jersey, however, hardly resembles a Packers jersey at this point - it's so badly worn that you can hardly make out the Packers logo, or Rodgers' name or number. Worn: David's jersey is so worn that you can barely see Rodgers' name on the back . The war at home: David is the lone Packers fan in a family of Vikings fans, Green Bay's biggest rival . But there's a twist: David's entire family are Minnesota Vikings fans, the heated rivals of David's beloved Packers. 'Being a Viking family we tried to convert him, but once we knew he wasn't going to convert we said OK,' his father said. While the rest of the Pehl's home is dedicated to the Vikings, David's bedroom resembles a shrine to the Packers - it even has a Packers logo painted on the wall that David's father swallowed his pride and painted for his young son. 'I told my friends so they didn't think I turned into a Packer fan that I . wore my Viking jersey while I painted (the Packer logo) it on the wall,' Dave Pehl said. Merry Christmas: David got his jersey as a Christmas gift - nearly three years ago! As far as basic hygiene goes, the Pehls say they hand-wash David's jersey every other day to keep it from smelling. David has more than a year to go if he plans to break the record, and he hopes that when he does he'll get to meet his hero Rodgers. The Pehls, however, have plans of their own - David's younger brother is on a mission of his own: to break the record for most consecutive days wearing a Vikings jersey. According to the Pehls, David's younger brother has worn his Vikings jersey every day for the last several weeks.","David Pehl, a sixth-grader from Wisconsin, has worn the same Aaron Rodgers jersey every day for 1,035 days .

Under strain: Britain's obesity epidemic is forcing dentist's to buy new chairs capable of supporting to people up to 71 stone . Britain's obesity crisis is forcing dentists to buy supersized chairs capable of supporting patients weighing up to 71 stone. The £25,000 recliners are four times the price of standard seats. They are designed for overweight and clinically obese patients, but are likely to become standard issue as more people come into those categories. A study published in the British . Dental Journal said the cost implications of replacing equipment to cope . with overweight patients would have a ‘very serious’ impact on NHS . resources. NHS surgeries cannot turn patients away for being too heavy . to be operated on safely. Tam . Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said the development ‘doesn’t . surprise me’. He added: ‘It comes after wider seats in planes and bigger . operating tables, hospital beds, ambulances, wheelchairs, you name it. ‘With . almost all new seats that are being made now for public places people . are having to think about new widths because, with three-quarters of the . adult population overweight, girths are bigger. ‘The obesity problem is going to go on for at least another generation so these chairs are going to be necessary.’ A . spokesman for the British Dental Association said: ‘We are aware that . the rise in the prevalence of obesity within the UK population is an . issue that will affect general dental practice in the near future.’ The study warned: ‘Sadly, the speed of the obesity epidemic has been greater than the recognition of the impending crisis by healthcare services. Many hospitals in developed countries are now recognising the need for bariatric equipment such as beds, hoists, wheelchairs and commodes to take patients weighing in excess of 350kg (55st). Warning: A study has suggested that the cost implications of overweight patients could have a 'very serious' impact on NHS reseources . ‘The cost implications for such re-equipping alone will have a very serious impact on resources, as will the increased width of bariatric beds, reducing the bed capacity of some hospital wards by half.’ At one dental surgery in the West Swindon District Centre a sign has been put up warning patients that the chairs carry a maximum weight of 35st. Other NHS dentists have bought the Barico bariatric recliner, which can accommodate patients up to 71 stone. It would have only just coped with Paul Mason, of Ipswich, who weighed 70st  and was the world’s fattest man before a gastric bypass helped him slim dramatically. In the past two years around 60 Barico recliners have been sold and demand is increasing. David Vandyke, of UK supplier Bariatric Ltd, said the tide of obesity meant the seats were likely to become commonplace. He added: ‘The Barico has a safe working load of 71 stone. Dental chairs at the moment have a safe working load of around 22 stone to 25 stone but they don’t really work at those weights once a patient is sat back. ‘It’s something the NHS is very aware of and obesity is now classed under the Equality Act, which means everyone has the right to access services.’ Obesity rates have more than doubled over the past 25 years in the UK. The costs to the NHS as a whole are projected to double to £10billion per year by 2050.","Designed for overweight and clinically obese patients .

Suicide: Anna Sargent jumped off a bridge into the Thames while suffering withdrawal from a drug she found on the internet . A PR executive leapt to her death from a bridge over the Thames after becoming dependent on a powerful drug she was taking to tackle her alcoholism, an inquest heard today. Anna Sargent had come across baclofen online when she was trying to find a way to get over her addiction to alcohol. But despite being treated at the exclusive Priory clinic, she was unable to deal with the drug's withdrawal symptoms and killed herself while in a depressive spiral. Ms Sargent, 36, was last seen alive on September 18 last year when she left Charing Cross Hospital in Hammersmith, West London, where she was being treated for severe panic attacks. Police searched for her after she went missing but were unable to find her until her body washed up on the shore of the River Thames next to Hammersmith Bridge eight days later, West London Coroner's Court heard. Ms Sargent's parents, David and Margaret, have accused staff at the Priory of mismanaging their daughter's attempts to stop using baclofen, whose withdrawal symptoms include hallucinations, insomnia and confusion. 'Clearly she had to get off baclofen but that led to withdrawal symptoms,' Mr Sargent said. 'When she heard from her consultant that the terrible side effects of withdrawing from baclofen would last for weeks, it caused her to feel more anxiety. Baclofen is a muscle relaxer and an antispastic agent. It is used to treat mutiple sclerosis, including spasm, pain and stiffness. Dr Olivier Ameisen tested the drug Baclofen and was amazed by the effect it had on reducing his drinking. He called for clinical trials to test his theory which he said suppresses the craving for drink and even wrote a book, called Le Dernier Verre (The Last Glass) which became a bestseller in France. The drug, Baclofen, appears to suppress the craving for alcohol. Between 1997 and 1999 he spent nine months in clinics trying everything from hypnosis to acupuncture, without success. Then a friend sent him an article about how a cocaine user with muscle problems had been cured of his addiction after being prescribed Baclofen. Two years later he started treating himself with the drug and noticed 'almost immediately' that his desire for alcohol was diminishing. Dr Ameisen, 55, wrote, 'I detested the taste of alcohol. But I needed its effects to exist in society.' He said the drug was so effective that it enabled alcoholics to return to social drinking rather than cutting it out completely, which is often the route that counsellors recommend. However, it has been known to impair your thinking. You may have withdrawal symptoms such as seizures or hallucinations when you stop using baclofen after using it over a long period of time. In 2012, it was approved for use in the treatment of alcoholism on a case by case basis. 'She couldn't face more of these terrible effects of feeling anxious and suicidal and she couldn't face life - it is down to baclofen.' Ms Sargent first suffered from depression as a teenager before graduating from Manchester Metropolitan University and pursuing a successful career in public relations, the inquest was told. She worked as a press officer at the BBC then became PR manager for Fox Kids Europe and ended up working with law and property firms. Last September, she took an overdose of baclofen, which was still in an experimental phase, and was admitted to the Priory. However, her parents claim that staff at the clinic, which has previously treated celebrities such as Amy Winehouse, had failed to inform them of the details of her treatment and did not send a letter of condolence after her death. A few days after entering the Priory . Ms Sargent was rushed to A&E at Charing Cross Hospital in the middle . of the night suffering severe panic attacks. Returning a verdict of suicide, coroner Sean Cummings called on the Priory to improve its communication with patients' families. 'The . medical cause of her death is drowning,' he said. 'Ms Sargent had a . history of depression for her teenage years and struggled with alcohol . use and was desperate to stopping using alcohol. 'She . researched online and discovered baclofen had some notoriety for the . helping of alcohol dependency. 'She eventually overdosed on baclofen and . was admitted to the Priory for detoxification and on 18 September 2012 . took her own life. 'This has been a very unhappy tale - Ms Sargent was a beautiful girl and she clearly loved her family.' A former colleague wrote on Ms Sargent's Facebook memorial page: 'I'm still shocked and saddened. 'Anna hid her troubles well from her colleagues and we wish we had realised. We were very fond of her.' Treatment: Ms Sargent was admitted to the Priory less than two weeks before her death in September .

Startling documents reveal that the FBI permitted its informants to commit at least 5,658 crimes in just one year, or an average of over 15 incidents a day. These new records, obtained by USA Today yesterday, provide a first public view of just how frequently the agency employs criminals to help with their inquiries. Yet this figure is just the tip of the iceberg. The FBI's set of sources represents a small fraction of the huge amount of informers used by state and local government every year. No data is available on other federal authorities such as the DEA. Nerve center: The J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington DC is headquarters for the FBI, and its network of informants . Vital: Joseph 'The Ear' Massino was the first official Mafia boss to cooperate with federal authorities in 2004. The Bonanno crime family boss agreed to wear a wire during conversations with his successor and implicated many of his former associates . 'The million-dollar question is: How . much crime is the government tolerating from its informants?' Alexandra Natapoff, a professor at Loyola Law School Los Angeles told USA Today. 'I'm sure that if we really knew that number, we . would all be shocked,' she added. This 2011 report, acquired by USA Today under the Freedom of Information Act, has been heavily redacted by the authorities. As such, the document doesn't explain the type or severity of the crimes committed by agency informers, or how many incidents involved the sources without permission of the FBI. The FBI has been required to submit these details . to the Justice Department for over a decade, after the agency allowed . James 'Whitey' Bulger to run a crime ring in exchange for information. The . agency has defended its actions in the past, saying that allowing its . informers - who are often criminals - to commit offences is a necessary . evil. Law change: The FBI has been required to submit informer details to the Justice Department since the agency allowed James 'Whitey' Bulger (pictured center as his trial in July 2013) to run a crime ring in exchange for information. 'It sounds like a lot, but you have to keep it in context,' said Shawn Henry, who worked on FBI criminal investigations until he retired in 2012. 'This is not done in a vacuum. It's not done randomly. It's not taken lightly,' he continued. An FBI spokeswoman declined to give more details. But USA Today reported that the agency had around 15,000 confidential sources in 2007. There are strict rules, enforced by the Justice Department, on what FBI informers are allowed to do. Violent crime for example cannot be authorized by agents and must have federal approval first. Yet a 2005 inspection concluded that the agency often broke these restrictions, as reported by USA Today. 'This is all being operated . clandestinely. Congress doesn't even have the information,' Democrat . Congressman Stephen Lynch told the paper. Betrayal? In 2013, the FBI released documents that confirmed that noted photographer Ernest Withers served as a paid informant from 1958 to 1972. Withers reported on the activity of several Civil Rights leaders, including Martin Luther King, Jr . Lynch has also sponsored legislation that would make federal authorities report serious crimes committed by their informers. 'I think there's a problem here, and we should have full disclosure to Congress,' he added.","Report reveals FBI informants committed 5,658 crimes in 2011 .

The daredevil's lightning reflexes allowed him to force his own plane downwards and miss the other aircraft by 'a quarter of a second' - or 100ft, an air investigation has found. His RAF jet was tearing through a valley in the Highlands on a training exercise when he saw the tiny glider coming towards him. To avoid collision at terrifying speed the fighter pilot .

Incredible: This MailOnline graphic shows how the terrific Tornado pilot used lightning reflexes to avoid a glider, by flying his jet on its back just above the ground .

Helen Gillespie, 30, has never developed breasts, had a boyfriend or moved out of her parents’ home. As a child she was so frightened of becoming an adult that she dramatically restricted her calorie intake to delay puberty. But ironically, far from maintaining a . childlike appearance, her eating disorder has turned her body into that of into a frail old woman's - her bones are crumbling and she suffers from varicose veins. Helen Gillespie (with mother Rachel), 30, has suffered with anorexia for the past 20 years. As a child she dieted because she thought staying thin would keep her young and delay puberty. But her condition has left her with the body of a 70-year-old - her bones are crumbling and she has varicose veins . 'Doctors tell me I’ve got the bones of an 70-year-old woman,' said Helen, from Perth, Scotland. 'They’re so weak that I broke my wrist after a fall when I was 14. If I don’t improve, I’ll continue to age prematurely. 'For a long time I’ve looked like a child - but now I feel like an old lady,' she added. Helen, who weighs six stone, started dieting when she was ten. By the time she was 15 she weighed four-and-a-half stone and was just 24 hours from death. She spent four months in hospital, . but as soon as she went home she starved herself until she had lost . as much weight as she needed to be readmitted. This cycle continued for the next two decades. Part of the problem was that Helen felt her parents had very high expectations of her. She strived to meet impossibly high ideals in her music, dance and academic work. She said: 'It is only recently . that I have realised that it was me, not my parents, who pushed me to do . better and better. I constantly crave praise, love and affection and . was terrified that my every move would be criticised.' Helen, pictured age 14, was hospitalised for four months when she was 15. She weighed just four and a half stone and doctors said she was close to death. Her repeated hospital stays have meant that she has not been able to pass any GCSEs or A-levels . Helen soon realised that one thing she was good at, was losing weight. 'My . weight was something I could control, and losing weight seemed to be a . talent which other people, particularly other girls, admired,' she said. As Helen grew up, her need for praise didn’t diminish and gaining responsibilities terrified her. She . said: 'My friends were starting to have boyfriends and I felt like a . young child inside. That was very scary and alien to me and I didn’t . feel I could connect with that. 'It comes down to having a huge fear of growing up and a huge fear of relationships, responsibilities and expectations.' Helen surrounded herself in a child-like world. She said: 'I lived very much in an imaginary world with my soft toys which I used to take everywhere until I was 11. Helen reached her heaviest when she was 20, but even then she only weighed nine stone (pictured). She said that her 'huge fear of relationships, responsibilities and expectations' has fuelled her behaviour to stay dangerously thin . Helen is pictured trying first bar of . chocolate age 22. At this point in her life, she weighed a healthier . eight stone but this was short-lived and her weight soon plummeted to . below five stone. She said that she was petrified of growing up and of all the responsibilities that came with adulthood . I . had to force myself to grow up - but it was quite painful because I . wasn’t ready. I would rather have just stayed young and innocent. But . now there’s no chance of that because I know what life is like now.' Helen’s fear of becoming an adult meant she missed puberty as a teenager, and didn’t have her first period until she was 26. And tragically, Helen has never developed breasts and has to wear a prosthesis made for patients who have had mastectomies. Helen has opened up about her battle with anorexia to raise awareness about the devastating condition . She said: 'I never developed properly, so I’ve got a child’s frame - I don’t have hips and I’m completely flat chested. 'But I wear the inserts every day and that’s quite important because it makes me feel like a woman.' Helen has spent virtually all of the past 20 years in hospital, meaning she has missed out on an education - she has no GCSEs or A-levels. It is only in the past four months that she has been able to live at home with her parents Rachel Gillespie, 62, who is a retired social worker and Bob Gillespie, a retired teacher, 63. However she is still unable to bring herself to eat a healthy adult diet and still eats just half the amount of calories a toddler would eat each day. She said: 'I’m starting to realise that I have a very childlike view of the world. When you’re a small child you think that everything will just come - you’ll be married, have children, a job, a house and a garden. But I’m starting to realise that actually life is very complicated - and it terrifies me. 'I think on a subconscious level by keeping my body young, I was stopping people having expectations of me.' Over time Helen has come to realise that she cannot live in the body of a child if she wants to achieve her dreams. Over the past 20 years she has battled with anorexia, with her weight increasing to a high of nine stone when she was 20, only to fall to the six stone she weighs now. She said: 'I would love to get married and have children. I go past a bridal shop about three times a week and I look in the window and look at the dresses and think ""if only"". 'I’ve missed out on my education and my rights of passage like relationships, socialising, friends, work. I’m sharing my story because I want to warn others that anorexia can take your childhood away. Sometimes I feel like I’m living in Never-Never Land, and I’m never going to find my way home. 'I do want to get better, but I do wish that I could be a child again and not have all the responsibilities that come with being an adult. 'I don’t believe that I’m beyond help - but I’ll never, ever be normal.'

The lawsuit, which was filed on Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court, seeks at least $10 million from the singer's estate and Sony Music Entertainment, claiming the entities improperly re-edited songs to deprive Jones of royalties and production fees. The music has been used in the film 'This Is It' and a pair of Cirque du Soleil shows based on the King of Pop's songs, the lawsuit states. Jones also claims that he should have received a producer's credit on the music in 'This Is It'. Long-time collaborators: Quincy Jones (right) is alleging he was cheated out of royalties for songs he produced that were re-released after Michael Jackson's death in 2009. Here the two are at the Grammy Awards in 1984 . Music producer Quincy Jones, pictured here in 2012, is responsible for some of Michael Jackson's biggest successes, including the 'Thriller' album . His lawsuit seeks an accounting of the estate's profits from the works so that Jones can determine how much he is owed. The producer worked with Jackson on three of his most popular solo albums, 'Off the Wall', 'Thriller' and 'Bad'. 'Quincy has been frustrated with these matters for a number of years, felt he was not making any progress and needed to take more formal action,' says Henry Gradstein, his attorney. Jackson's estate wrote in a statement that it was saddened by Jones' lawsuit. 'To the best of its knowledge, Mr. Jones has been appropriately compensated over approximately 35 years for his work with Michael,' the statement said. An after-hours message left at Sony Music's New York offices was not immediately returned. Jackson's hits 'Billie Jean', 'Thriller' and 'Don't Stop `Til You Get Enough' are among the songs Jones claims were re-edited to deprive him of royalties and his producer's fee. Jones' lawsuit states the producer's contracts called for him to have the first opportunity to re-edit or alter the songs, in part to protect his reputation. The show goes on: Feeding a huge public appetite for new Michael Jackson material after the singer's tragic death, Cirque du Soleil launched the show Michael Jackson: ONE, in Las Vegas in May. It is one of the post-houmous royalty claims Quincy Jones has included in his lawsuit . Out of his hands: Quincy Jones is alleging he was cheated out of royalties for songs he produced that were re-released after Michael Jackson's death in 2009. Here, Jackson performs at The Apollo Theater in New York in April 2002 . Following Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, the superstar had a resurgence of popularity, causing the executors of his estate and those who had control over his work to try and find ways to release new works. In October that year, 'This Is It', a documentary from AEG Live and The Michael Jackson Company, was released, centering on behind-the-scenes footage of Jackson preparing for what would have been his final concert tour. Two years later Cirque du Soleil launched a traveling theater show called 'Michael Jackson: The Immortal Tour', which has so far grossed an estimated $300 million. In May, Cirque du Soleil premiered a new production called 'Michael Jackson: One'. The 'This Is It' soundtrack included re-edits of 'Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough', 'She's Out Of My Life', 'Thriller', 'Beat It', 'Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' and 'Billy Jean'. The Cirque du Soleil production and album includes re-edits of many of those songs as well as 'Burn The Disco Out', 'Workin' Day And Night', 'Baby Be Mine' and others. Jones claims the terms of his deal were breached when third parties were allowed to exploit these works 'without first providing a reasonable opportunity to Jones to perform such remixes and/or re-edits'. Then the complaint refers to 'clandestine agreements' allegedly made to reduce Jones' royalties.","New lawsuit filed in L.A. on Friday by long-time Michael Jackson collaborator and friend, Quincy Jones .

A beautician and her mother have died within weeks of each other after both losing their fight against cancer. Zoe Phokeerdoss, 38, passed away at the end of June after breast cancer spread to her lungs, pancreas and liver. Her mother, Doreen Bullock, 58, had died just weeks earlier of ovarian cancer in May. They both carried the faulty BRCA-1 gene which put them at a far higher risk of cancer than the rest of the population. Zoe Phokeerdos (left) died after her cancer spread to her lungs, liver and pancreas. Just weeks before, her mother, Doreen Bullock, died of ovarian cancer. They both carried the BRCA-1 gene, which puts them at a higher risk of developing cancer . Mrs Phokeerdoss, a mother-of-four, had already beat the disease in 2009, only for it return in February this year. Ms Bullock, from Birches Head in Staffordshire, died of ovarian cancer on May 20. Tragically Mrs Phokeerdoss was too ill with cancer to attend her mother’s funeral. Just weeks later, on June 30, she then succumbed to the disease. Mrs Phokeerdos (pictured at a wedding 2009) left behind husband Dean, 42, daughters Jordan, 20, and seven-year-old Evan, as well as sons Kyran, 14, and Corey, 13 . Mother Ms Bullock (far left) is pictured with daughter Mrs Phokeerdoss (far right). Ms Bullock died on May 20 but sadly her daughter was too ill to attend . A cell needs to have a number of mistakes in its genetic code before it becomes cancerous. Doctors call these mistakes faults or mutations. They can occur due to substances people come into contact with. Or, they can happen because of mistakes that cells make when copying their genetic code before dividing into two new cells.Most of these abnormal cells die or are killed off by the immune system. It usually takes many years to gather enough genetic mistakes to cause cancer. But it is possible to be born with a gene fault that increases the risk of cancer. Scientists have identified a number of these so-called 'cancer genes'. The first genes to be found were BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 - women with these genes have a 50 to 80 per cent chance of getting breast cancer in their lifetime. Women who tests positive can either have regular breast screenings or have surgery to remove their breasts (and possibly ovaries). Her husband Dean Phokeerdoss, . 42, from Sneyd Green, also in Stafforshire, said: 'Zoe was such a . fighter. Even in the last month we managed to venture out for little . trips. 'Her one big regret was that she couldn’t get to her mum’s funeral, because she was too ill. 'But in the end, when Zoe went it was so peaceful. 'Zoe had time for everyone. She was the life and soul of the party. If she believed in something she was so passionate. 'I remember driving home and we saw four or five down-and-outs drinking near the Sneyd Arms. She told me to stop the car and went over to talk to them. 'There was one in particular that she used to help a lot after that, she helped to get him clean - she did that four or five times for different people. Zoe also left behind daughters Jordan, 20, and seven-year-old Evan, as well as sons Kyran, 14, and Corey, 13. When Zoe wasn't a busy mother-of-three she spent a lot of time at the local church helping with the soup kitchen, giving meals to the homeless. 'She had recently started sending packages to an orphanage in South Africa,' added Mr Phokeerdoss. 'If . the cancer hadn’t taken her, I think in two to three years’ time we . would have been living in South Africa, she wanted to help in the . orphanage and then set up one of her own - that was her calling.' Mrs Phokeerdos (pictured in 2009) worked a beautician and was an active member of the local church where she helped at the local soup kitchen.

The soils and topography of Australia prevent almost all of its rain from running off into the ocean, causing Australia to act like an enormous sponge . A combination of weather patterns over the Indian and Pacific oceans funneled so much rain over Australia that the world's sea levels fell in 2011, scientists said. Unlike other continents, the soils and . topography of Australia prevent almost all of its rain from . running off into the ocean, causing dry areas of Australia to act like an enormous sponge. According to a U.S. study, the effect caused by the La Niña weather pattern around Australia meant global sea levels fell for 18 months during 2010 and 2011, bucking the long-term trend of rising sea levels . caused by higher temperatures and melting ice sheets. The scientists said that as the atmospheric patterns have returned to normal, more rain is falling over the tropical oceans once more and the seas are rising again. Dr John Fasullo, a scientist at the National . Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in the U.S. said: 'It's a beautiful illustration of how complicated our climate system is.' 'The . smallest continent in the world can affect sea level worldwide. Its . influence is so strong that it can temporarily overcome the background . trend of rising sea levels that we see with climate change.' Dr Fasullo said most of the rain that normally falls over land usually travels back to the sea via streams and rivers over months so when there is torrential rain over the land, the effect on the world's sea levels is almost invisible. However, during the La Niña of 2010-11, which saw the temperature of the eastern Pacific ocean drop and more rainfall over land then normal, global sea levels dropped by 0.3 inches for around 18 months. Floodplains shown here in southwestern Queensland in September 2009. According to a U.S. study, the effect caused by the La Niña weather pattern around Australia meant global sea levels fell for 18 months during 2010 and 2011 . The fall goes against the larger trend of sea levels rising by around 0.1 inch per year since 1993, which is believed to be caused by melting glaciers and ice sheets as well as water temperatures warming up, which are linked to global warming. However, since 2011 and the end of La Niña, sea levels have risen faster than before at around 0.4 inches per year. The research, published in Geophysical Research Letters, links the fall in sea levels to more water storage on land, which occurred at the same time as La Niña. Dr Fasullo noted there have been other La Niña events when scientists did not observe a drop in sea levels as dramatic as in 2010-11. By the time this second image was taken in March 26, 2011, a huge amount of rain had fallen across Australia instead of in the ocean. The scientists said that as the atmospheric patterns have returned to normal, more rain is falling over the tropical oceans once more and the seas are rising again . In a bid to explain the phenomenon, the scientists found La Niña coincided with two other weather patterns that effectively funneled the water over Australia's land mass, where it seldom rains. The Indian Ocean Dipole weather pattern, which carried atmospheric moisture across the ocean from the west, met the easterly moving moisture from La Niña. A third pattern called the Southern Annular Mode then caused the rain to fall on the huge continent. Dr Fasullo told NBC News: 'You have this collision of transports in . the Pacific and then southward into Australia — so a big funnel of . tropical moisture into Australia — and that led to one of the wettest . years on record in Australia, if not the wettest.' Almost 1ft of rain fell over Australia during the 18 month period in 2010-11, which was effectively trapped in the Outback (pictured) with nowhere to go. Dr Fasullo said only in Australia could the atmosphere carry such heavy tropical rains to such a large area, only to have those rains fail to make their way to the ocean . Almost one foot of rain fell over Australia during the period and the rain was effectively trapped in the Outback - the dry, interior of the continent - with nowhere to go. Dr Fasullo said: 'No other continent has this combination of atmospheric set-up and topography. Only in Australia could the atmosphere . carry such heavy tropical rains to such a large area, only to have those . rains fail to make their way to the ocean.' Much of the water collected in the Lake Eyre basin, which has been likened to a massive inland sea in the east of the country, while most of the rest of the water was absorbed by the dry soil of the Western Plateau. It is not known whether this strange occurrence will happen more regularly as earth warms up and scientists are not sure how global warming could effect the El Niño and La Niña cycle. Dr Fasullo believes the event if partly due to climate change, but also partly natural as he claims it was a 'serendipitous interaction' of weather patterns that caused global sea levels to temporarily fall.","U.S. scientists said a combination of weather patterns over the Indian and Pacific oceans funneled rain over Australia .

A mother whose tirade of racist abuse at fellow passengers on a tram received millions of viewings on YouTube was bound over to keep the peace today. A judge said that Emma West, 36, was clearly suffering from mental health problems at the time of the outburst on board the tram in Croydon, south London, and had unwittingly overdosed on the medication she took for depression. Footage of the mother-of-two yelling 'what has this country come to? None of you is f****** English' went viral and was viewed by millions around the world. Footage of Emma West yelling at passengers on the tram in Croydon was watched by million of people across the globe . West, from Croydon, was also handed a 24-month community order for offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against her partner and assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty as she appeared for sentencing at Croydon Crown Court. The court heard witnesses described West 'reeking of alcohol' when she carried out the verbal attack. Prosecutor Julius Capon said: 'She in essence persecuted a number of passengers on the tram, subjecting them to some disgusting racial abuse.' He said the things she said included 'you’re not English', 'none of you are English', 'f*** off' and 'get back to your own countries'. Mr Capon said many of the passengers were 'upset' by West’s behaviour. 'Some of them described themselves as being disgusted, shocked and horrified,' he said. Emma West (pictured outside court last month) pleaded guilty to a racially aggravated section 5 public order offence . But he added that it was not them who complained to police, rather that it came to their attention after a passenger who had filmed it posted it on the internet. David Martin-Sperry, defending West, said the defendant’s offending was out of character and she does not harbour any racist views. Mr Martin-Sperry told the court he had heard figures quoted that the footage had received either 11 million or 25 million viewings on YouTube. 'She was a normal, perfectly healthy young woman who held a job for ten years and events took a turn for the worse. There were mental health issues, she was committed more than once for treatment' - Recorder of Croydon Judge Warwick McKinnon . The huge amount of publicity the case generated led her to attempt suicide and she had become reclusive due to the abuse she received when she left the house, he said. It also led her to receive flowers and messages of support from far right supporters. Some have even sent her cheques. 'People gave support to what they thought was a noble cause - they could not be more wrong,' he said. Mr Martin-Sperry said before the tram incident took place West had admitted herself to an institution attached to the psychiatric Maudsley Hospital in Camberwell, south London. On the day of the incident, in late 2011, she had again felt 'overheated' and went to see her psychiatrist who increased her dose of citalopram. After collecting her prescription she took one pill after having already taken one that day and drank a large glass of wine before taking the tram home. West was also handed a 24-month community order for offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against her partner and assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty as she appeared for sentencing at Croydon Crown Court (pictured) Mr Martin-Sperry said that not only had she taken twice her usual dosage, five days later the maximum limit was reduced from 60mg to 40mg, and so she had in fact taken two and a half times the recommended dose when that was taken into account. Following a string of adjournments in which her lawyers claimed her mental health problems meant she was not fit to stand trial, West pleaded guilty to a racially aggravated section 5 public order offence in June - 18 months after the rant. For this offence, West was bound over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for 12 months, and must not engage in any offensive or disorderly behaviour on public transport. 'She in essence persecuted a number of passengers on the tram, subjecting them to some disgusting racial abuse' - Prosecutor Julius Capon . She pleaded guilty in May this year to attacking her partner of 12 years Ricky Metson with an ornamental knife and assaulting a police officer. For this offence she was given a community order for 24 months with a supervision requirement for the period under the supervision of a probation officer and a mental health treatment requirement with her current psychiatrist. Recorder of Croydon Judge Warwick McKinnon said: 'She was a normal, perfectly healthy young woman who held a job for ten years and events took a turn for the worse. 'There were mental health issues, she was committed more than once for treatment. 'After months and months and months of adjournments - not your fault - because the primary concern was your mental health, you did plead guilty and I give you full credit for that.'","Judge said Emma West was clearly suffering mental health problems .

The plans reveal the extent of the enormous development that Reade Griffith wants beneath his mansion . This is the vast two-storey basement that is costing a wealthy hedge fund manager £825,000 in council fees – on top of £4million to build it. The plans reveal the extent of the enormous development – equivalent to the size of 20 two-bedroom flats – that Reade Griffith wants beneath his mansion. He intends to install a swimming pool, spa, wine store, cinema and games room under the existing building and gardens. An ‘appropriately designed’ first floor extension is also proposed. The entire 1,130 square metre project is expected to take two years to complete at an estimated cost of £4million to Mr Griffith, 48, and his 42-year-old wife Elizabeth. But the vast scale of the work, on two four-storey villas in London’s Notting Hill, means it has fallen foul of rules that normally apply only to commercial developments. In order to win planning permission Mr Griffith, a former US Marine who has an estimated fortune of £55million, has agreed to pay Kensington and Chelsea Council £825,000 towards social housing in his community. Under Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act developers are required to make a contribution on any project bigger than 800 square metres. A typical new home in London is around 102 square metres. The payment is in addition to a £20,625 ‘monitoring fee’, a £42,500 community infrastructure levy to the Greater London Authority and a £337 planning application fee. A member of staff at the property, listed as a ‘building of local interest’, said yesterday that the couple are currently in the US. A spokesman for Mr Griffith’s company Polygon Investment Partners, which has offices in Belgravia and New York, said he was not available to comment. However a friend of Mr Griffith said he was ‘surprised’ by the fee. The entire 1,130 square metre project is expected to take two years to complete at an estimated cost of £4million . The development is the latest  in a growing trend for ‘iceberg’ homes where projects dig down below ground to create more space than traditional extensions. Planning applications for basement extensions in Kensington and Chelsea have soared from 13 in 2001 to 307 last year. The huge excavation necessary for the project is likely to cause major disruption to neighbouring properties with scores of lorries removing earth from the site. One neighbour said: ‘It will certainly be one of the “iceberg houses” and sadly, our house will probably be the Titanic.’ Kensington and Chelsea Council . yesterday said the £825,000 figure had been suggested by the developer . and was later agreed by  planning officials. A . spokesman said: ‘It is very unusual for a Section 106 Agreement to . apply to a domestic development but this is a very large project.’ Property experts suggested the couple may be keen to start the project . before new rules are introduced reducing the size of subterranean . developments. The vast scale of the work, on two four-storey villas in London's Notting Hill, means it has fallen foul of rules that normally apply only to commercial developments . Richard Barber, partner at developers WA Ellis, said: ‘I’m shocked at the size of the extension and the size of the fee they’re suggesting. It’s well out of the range of normal extensions. They’re obviously trying to get this in before the big change in October. ‘Kensington and Chelsea are reducing the amount of area that you can create under a garden. We’ll likely be seeing a rush of others doing this before the deadline.’ The development is expected to add around £10million to the value of the combined property, which already has a total of 13 bedrooms. Once finished the property will be worth an estimated £50million, making it one of the most expensive in one of the most fashionable areas in London. The project was applied for in the name of Mrs Griffith, who owns one of the properties. Her husband owns the neighbouring house through a company.","Reade Griffith intends to install swimming pool, spa and cinema in basement .

The group scattered after the attack but police arrested two teens in a Lowe's parking lot shortly after - Kashawn Kirton, 18, and Daehrell Finch, 17. Police say they also arrested the 12-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy. But Kirton, an 18-year-old St Francis College student from East Flatbush, says he was not involved in the attack and was arrested because he was wearing the same outfit as one of the attackers. 'I have relatives who are white. Cousins and stuff,' he told the New York Daily News. 'My school is mainly white. More than half of my friends are white. I wouldn't use words like that.' Kirton was charged with gang assault, harassment, and menacing charges - all as hate crimes. He was released on $50,000 bond and has no prior arrests. Finch also faces gang assault, assault, menacing and harassment but they have not been labeled hate crime charges. Finch's prior record includes assault, theft of services and trespass charges and he is being held on Rikers Island. Police are still looking for six more suspects in the case.","Roland Russo was driving in a car with his wife Alanna, both 30, when a group of 10 black teens were blocking his way during a green light .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 16:08 EST, 27 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:25 EST, 28 February 2013 . For Zaida Saleh, like for many observant Muslim women, manicures have long posed a religious problem. With prayers five times a day, and a pre-prayer ritual that requires washing the hands and arms, traditional fingernail polish has been mostly off limits because it prevents water from making contact with the nails. A new 'breathable' nail polish by a Polish company, Inglot, is changing that. The company and some Muslims say the polish is the first of its kind because it lets air and moisture pass through to the nail. A craze has built up around it with Muslim women in recent months after an Islamic scholar in the United States tested its permeability and published an article saying that, in his view, it complies with Muslim law. Manicures for all! A craze has built up around O2M nail polish after an Islamic scholar in the U.S. tested its permeability and published an article saying that, in his view, it complies with Muslim law . 'It's huge,' said Saleh, a 35-year-old who hadn't polished her nails in many years but immediately went out and bought the product in five colors, including a bright pink, a burgundy and a mauve. 'I am excited. I feel more feminine — and I just love it.' The news of Inglot's breathable polish has in recent months spread quickly from woman to woman and over the Internet. It also has given Inglot a boost in sales of the product, called O2M, for oxygen and moisture. The nail polish now stands as one of the final life achievements of Wojciech Inglot, a Polish chemist and entrepreneur who developed it to create what he billed as a healthier alternative to traditional nail enamels, which block the passage of moisture and oxygen to the nail. He died suddenly on Saturday at the age of 57 after suffering internal hemorrhaging, and is being laid to rest on Wednesday in his hometown of Przemysl. Inspired idea: Wojciech Inglot, late founder of the Polish cosmetics company Inglot, who died on Saturday, invented 'breathable' nail polish . Inglot has been the recipient of several business leadership awards for taking an enterprise that he started in 1983, when Poland was still under communist rule, and turning it into an international success. A Polish award he received last year praised him for 'proving that Poland is a country where innovative technologies go hand-in-hand with beauty.' Today his company has shops in almost 50 countries, including one at Times Square in New York City and boutiques in malls from Moscow to Istanbul to Dubai. Though the Muslim holy book, the . Quran, does not specifically address the issue of nail polish, some . Islamic scholars have said that water must touch the surface of the nail . for the washing ritual to be done correctly. Some . Muslim women might put nail polish on after finishing the last prayer . of the day before going out, and then take it off again before dawn . prayers. They can also wear it during their periods, when they are . excused from the prayers, but some find it embarrassing to do so because . it could signal they are menstruating. Some simply don't want to take . the trouble of getting a manicure that won't last long. 'It . was a big headache for me to put it on only for five days, so I didn't . wear it for a long time,' said Saleh, who was born in Sri Lanka but now . lives in Anaheim, California, where she is a teacher of preschool and . kindergarten level children. 'This was a huge breakthrough for me. We . are supposed to cover up, but nowhere does it say ""don't be . fashionable.""' Nobody was more surprised by the splash it made with Muslims than Inglot himself. 'I don't think there is a single Muslim living here,' Inglot said in an interview with The Associated Press nine days before his death at his factory in Przemysl, near the border with Ukraine. 'We didn't even think about this.' Inglot began about four years ago to develop the formula for the breathable enamel, which uses a polymer similar to that in the newest generation of contact lenses. Word-of-mouth success: The news of Inglot's breathable polish has in recent months spread quickly from woman to woman and over the Internet . Inglot said the chemical formula is 'tricky' and 'quite expensive' to produce, and that the profit margin on O2M is not high. However, he said he was determined to develop a breathable polish knowing that consumers are ever more focused on health and expecting them to welcome a varnish that would let the nail breathe. Low profit margin: Inglot said the chemical formula is 'tricky' and 'quite expensive' to produce . He said the enthusiastic Muslim reaction to the product began after an Islamic scholar, Mustafa Umar, published an article on his blog in November declaring it permissible. The result was a 'serious increase in the sale' of O2M. Inglot said the company was unable to immediately meet all requests for orders, but that the phenomenon was so fresh that he didn't yet have any figures on sales. 'But it looks very promising,' Inglot said. 'We were very surprised and very happy with that.' Umar, director of education and outreach with the Islamic Institute of Orange County in California, said he decided to study the matter because Muslim women had already been discussing the product in online forums. There was uncertainty over whether it would be ritually compliant, and they weren't getting any answers. 'So I decided to go ahead and write an article on this because I know how important it is for Muslim women around the world,' Umar said. The research involved putting the O2M polish and a standard polish on coffee filters, letting them both dry, and then putting water drops on top of each and seeing if the moisture seeped through. In the case of the traditional nail polish it did not, but it went through the O2M polish and even wet a second filter below. Umar said he has gotten an enthusiastic reception to his opinion from women — not only because they are reveling in the chance to accessorize with colorful varnishes. 'Usually when men give a religious ruling or verdict, they tell women that something is not allowed,' Umar, 31, said. 'They felt so good that someone was finally telling them ""you are allowed to do this.""' New possibilities: Muslim women are reveling in the chance to accessorize with colorful varnishes . There are still some outstanding questions, however, about how breathable the nail polish will be if multiple coats are used — say a clear bottom coat, two layers of color plus a top coat, as is common. Before his death, Inglot was working to answer this question and gather other data on the product. The company's other managers are deep in mourning over losing Inglot but plan to continue that effort. Inglot had insisted on having more data before he felt he could responsibly promote the varnish as being compliant with Islamic law. Islam has multiple schools of thought and no universally agreed-upon figure — such as the pope of the Roman Catholic church — to issue final rulings on religious legal interpretation. So it's not clear if all Islamic scholars would agree on O2M's permissibility, or on whether wearing nail polish at all is compatible with Muslim notions of modesty.","The nail polish now stands as one of the final life achievements of Wojciech Inglot, who died suddenly on Saturday at the age of 57 ."

Second wife: Knowing about the insurance payout on his son, when Cindy, pictured, found out her husband took out a $1.2million policy on her, she grew suspicious and feared for her life . Mother and son: Karl Karlsen is awaiting trial for the murder of his son, Levi, but now his daughter believes that he is also behind his first wife's death in a house fire . Justice for Levi: Karl Karlsen's current wife, Cindy, managed to get him to explain how and why his son Levi was crushed whilst fixing parts underneath a truck . Karlsen was arrested and charged with . second-degree murder and insurance fraud last year after his second . wife Cindy - fearing for her life - agreed to wear a wire while talking . to him about his son's death. A judge ruled recently that the never-before-heard tapes could be used as evidence against him in his trial. In 2008, Levi Karlsen, 23, was crushed to death when the truck he was working on slipped off its jack and landed on top of him. His death was initially ruled an accident, but Karlsen collected a $700,000 life insurance payout after the incident, raising suspicions. A family member tipped off the police about the large insurance policy and opened an investigation into his death last year. Authorities in California also opened an investigation into the 1991 California house fire that killed Karlsen's wife and Deroche's mother Christina Karlsen. Karlsen cashed in on a $200,000 life insurance policy soon after. Did he do it? Karl Karlsen's wife, Christina, died in a house fire but his daughter believes that he may have been responsible for her death . Truth uncovered: Christina Karlsen perished in a house fire whilst her children and husband escaped - but her daughter believes there is more to the story . On the tapes, obtained by ABC's Nightline, the 52-year-old can be heard telling Cindy while they were in a restaurant that he had removed his truck's front tires and raised it on a single jack before Levi volunteered to do the repair. 'I . didn't push the truck, I said,' Karlsen said after Cindy asked him for . the truth in Levi's death. 'No, I said I had nothing to do -- . but I said I took advantage of the situation once it happened.' Police arrested Karlsen soon after and interrogated him for ten hours, in which he denied killing his son 75 times. In . the police interrogation tapes, also obtained by ABC News, he said: 'I . found him dead. I f***ing panicked. I don't know. I don't know. I left . him.' Confession: After ten hours of interrogation by police, Karlsen finally admitting playing a part in his son's death and leaving him to die . Suspicious: Karl Karlsen's first wife Christina perished in a house fire after she became trapped in the bathroom - the windows of which, Karlsen had boarded up with wood and 17 nails just days before . Finally he told police he had been there when the truck fell on his son and caused it to fall. 'I . opened the truck door because I had to get inside to move the linkage . for the truck, and when I did, it tipped, and it just, whoosh, f***ing . fell over,' Karlsen said. He maintains it was an accident, but did admit that he left his son to die. 'He . did admit that he caused the truck to fall on his son. He did admit . that he left his son on the floor dying, but he never admitted that it . was a planned, deliberate act,' said Seneca County Lt Investigator John . Cleere. 'The officers . at the scene didn't see anything out of the ordinary,' he told ABC. 'They saw what appeared to be two grieving parents and what appeared to . be an accident.' Knowing . about the insurance payout on his son, when Cindy found out her husband . took out a $1.2million policy on her, she grew suspicious and feared for . her life. Wire-tapped: Karl Karlsen was recorded by his wife explaining how a truck his son was working on was precariously balanced . That's what prompted her to work with . police, leading to second-degree murder and insurance fraud charges . against Karl Karlsen in the death of his 23-year-old son, Levi. And . New York and California authorities are now taking a new look at the . circumstances of the 1991 death of his former wife, Christina Karlsen. Karlsen has not been charged in relation to anything related to his wife's death. During the house fire that killed their mother, Christina, was screaming to get the children out of the house. Christina, was trapped in the bathroom after spilled kerosene . was ignited by a faulty electric light. Although Karl Karlsen is . credited with getting Levi and their other two children out safely, . Christina was unable to escape through the bathroom window because . Karlsen had boarded it up from the outside days before, saying it was . broken. ‘At the time, I was six years old. I didn't understand that my mother was behind that wall dying,’ Deroche said. A week after the fire, Karlsen left California for upstate New York with his three children to be near his family. Levi Karlsen, father of two young children, was crushed to death by a pickup truck at his family's farm . Suspect: Karl Karlsen arriving for a court appearance at the Seneca County Courthouse in Waterloo, New York, last December . As she got older, Deroche said she was . able to process what happened and came to believe that her father . didn't do enough to help save her mother. ‘You . know, that's not how people are supposed to act when someone they love . is trapped and literally burning in front of them,’ Deroche said. It . wasn't until Deroche and her brother Levi were 11 or 12 when she said . they secretly discussed the possibility that their father wasn't being . truthful regarding their mother's death. ‘Between . the two of us...we knew, because he didn't try,’ Deroche said. ‘He . didn't make an effort to save her. He just stood there,’ she told ABC . News. However, when she . and Levi confronted their father, Deroche said, ‘his biggest concern was . that he wondered what the community would think of his own children . accusing him of murdering their mother.’ Karl Karlsen has been charged with murdering his son and will be reinvestigated for a fire that killed his first wife. He collected insurance payouts on both occasions . The family farm in upstate New York where Levi Karlsen died. Karl Karlsen bought the property with insurance money paid out from a suspicious fire that killed his first wife . After she received the news that Levi . had died in an apparent accident, Deroche said she tried to put her . suspicions of Karlsen's involvement in Levi's death at bay, but was . relieved when she learned about the investigation into her father. ‘It was never a question for me,’ Deroche said. ‘It was a matter of fact.’ When . Karlsen was jailed, Deroche said she went to visit her father and told . him that she knew he was involved in her mother's and Levi's deaths. ‘He . won't ever own up to Levi,’ Deroche said. ‘But he did tell me… 'It's . been over 20 years, and they still haven't got me yet. What makes you . think they're going to get me now?’ Karlsen . will be put on trial in two weeks but  a judge ruled that testimony . about the California fire and Christina Karlsen's death is off limits.

Accused: Nek Alam, 71, pictured, and three members of his family are accused of leading a terrifying campaign of violence against Ghalib Hussein . A child-like man nicknamed 'The Clown' by his own family was subjected to a campaign of violence and cruelty by relatives who regarded him as a financial burden, a court was told today. In one of many painful and humiliating punishments Ghalib Hussain, 27, of Accrington, Lancashire, had one end of a pair of jump leads clamped onto his nose and . was hit with the other end because he cannot read and write, Burnley Crown Court heard. On other occasions Mr Hussain was punched in the face when he . failed to learn Arabic text and was also warned he would be buried alive . in a cemetery and have his tongue ripped out. He was also whipped with a belt and a stick by those who should have cared for him, it is alleged. At Burnley Crown Court, his uncle Nek . Alam, 72, and Alam’s sons Janghir Alam, 29, Zahir Alam, 33, and Zahoor . Alam, 32, went on trial accused of false imprisonment, making threats to . kill and causing grievous bodily harm. The jury was told he also had to kiss the feet of his uncle and was not allowed to eat until he was told to. Finally he was rescued by police who found him huddled on a settee at his . home unable to stand due to a broken right hip, said to be inflicted when he was . forced to the ground and jumped on. He had earlier been found wandering around the area and he clung . onto a lamp-post in a distressed state when officers tried to take him . home. These regular beatings and threats over a three year period were because he was seen by his family as 'slow in the head' and a 'mental case.' The jury was told Mr Hussain had been unable to read or write and to speak little or no English and had little or no formal education. Mr Jeremy Lasker, prosecuting, said Mr Hussain came to Britain in about 2006 from his native Pakistan as a result of an arranged marriage to Nek Alam’s daughter, Sofia. She later rejected her husband and the victim was left 'stranded and alone' in the Alam household. Mr Lasker said: 'It’s pretty clear that he was not regarded with much affection by his relatives. Mr Hussain, the crown say, because of his problems, was unable to work in order to pay his way. Brothers: Zahir Alam (left) and sibling Janghir, right, with their father behind, waged war on the man because he had learning difficulties and could not read or write . 'As a consequence of that, the financial burden for his care and upkeep fell upon the rest of his family. 'It’s against this particular background that Ghalib Hussain was ill-treated and assaulted on a regular and continuing basis by his uncle and cousins. Brutal: Mr Hussain allegedly suffered a broken hip at the hands of the family, including Zahoor Alam, pictured outside court . 'Those assaults or beatings appeared to have been carried out for the most part as a result of punishments, either because he had done something wrong or was perceived to have done something wrong.' Mr Lasker said on June 26 2010 police were asked to look out for a man described as vulnerable and found Mr Hussain, in traditional Asian dress walking the streets. A member of the public helped translate and he was asked if the officers could take him home. But he became visibly distressed and was seen to cling to a lamp-post. 'He reported about being beaten and said the people living there would not let him return to Pakistan,' said Mr Lasker. A relative arrived at the scene and took him home where it is claimed he was subjected to another beating for daring to speak out. Four days later, a social worker visited the address with a police officer and insisted on speaking with Mr Hussain alone. He was initially told Mr Hussain was in London but the victim was found huddled on a settee in a front room. The court heard the victim said he didn’t want to speak loudly in case he was overheard and then told the officer of his treatment. Mr Lasker said Mr Hussain, who was unable to stand up, was taken to hospital by ambulance on July 1 and had surgery to insert a number of screws in his broken right hip. He remained there until July 20. On his release, he gave an account of what he claimed had happened to him. The prosecutor said the crown alleged that on June 26, 2010, Mr Hussain had been forced to the ground and Zahir and Zahoor Alam then put their weight on him and jumped on his leg. Janghir Alam hit him with his belt. Mr Lasker claimed: 'The crown say he was made, whilst on the floor, to kiss Nek Alam’s feet whilst he was in a punishment position and told he would be buried alive in a cemetery and have his tongue ripped out. It was alleged that Zahoor Alam took a pair of jump leads, attached one end to the victim’s nose and used the other end to hit the palms of his hands. The father and sons were later arrested. Mr Lasker told the jury: 'These four defendants deny any of this cruel and violent behaviour which the crown say took place.' When interviewed and arrested, Nek Alam said Mr Hussain was 'mentally sick' and was spoilt by his grandmother. Janghir Alam said he was 'a burden', while Zahir Alam said he had 'a childish mind' and would be referred to as 'the clown or the mental case.' All four men deny causing grievous bodily harm with intent and an alternative allegation of inflicting grievous bodily harm, on June 26, 2010, making a threat to kill on the same date, false imprisonment between June 26 and July 1 2010 and putting a person in fear of violence by harassment, between January 2007 and July 2010. Nek, Janghir and Zahoor Aslam also plead not guilty to battery between January 2007 and June 2010.

Collapse: Lieutenant Colonel Michael McErlain, 45, died . during a D-Day run on the clifftops of the Normandy beaches in France . An army surgeon, who treated injured children in Afghanistan, died while competing in a charity D-Day run along the Normandy beaches in France. Lieutenant Colonel Michael McErlain, 45, was one of around 30 runners and was bringing up the rear when he collapsed around two miles into the 44-mile race. Another competitor, an American fireman, tried desperately to revive him but he died at the scene on the morning of June 6. The father-of-three, who worked as a spinal surgeon at Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey, had co-founded the event with wife Joanna and brother-in-law Giles Barnes and had competed in it six times before. Mr Barnes, who was also competing, heard about the collapse and ran four miles to the scene but arrived to find Lt Col McErlain grey and cold. He had died about 20 minutes previously. The event, held in aid of the British Limbless ex-Services Men's Association, aims to raise awareness of the sacrifices made by allied soldiers in World War Two. A post-mortem examination revealed Lt Col McErlain, from Hindhead, Surrey, died from ischemic heart disease. At an inquest into the death held in Alton, Hampshire, Mr Barnes described his brother-in-law as an extremely talented man who was very 'humble' about his achievements in life. Recalling the day he died he said: 'It was about 16 degrees outside. A lovely temperature to be doing it. It was perfect conditions. 'I was going to be doing the support part of the run. Every seven miles giving them painkillers, something to eat and drink and be on their way. 'Mike was used to doing the run. He was the slowest person on the run, but made a point of being the slowest so he could literally bring up the rear. 'I would imagine he was not even running. More of a shuffle. Certainly the runner who was with him was more interested in sightseeing and taking photographs. Lt Col McErlain, who worked as a spinal surgeon at Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey, had co-founded the event with wife Joanna and brother-in-law Giles Barnes and had competed in it six times before . 'He was American and with Mike when he collapsed. They were stop starting. They had been having a conversation about the beautiful weather. 'Some of Mike's last words were that he said it was such a historically wonderful thing to do and the setting of the run itself would be enough to get people to do it. 'It was such a beautiful run. To have that conversation suggests it he wasn't really going for it. 'He did not complain about having to stop and was chatting away and suddenly he collapsed.' The fireman, known as Brian from Colorado, said Michael was gasping for breath and lost consciousness. Despite his best efforts to perform CPR he died in his arms during the race aimed at raising awareness of the sacrifices made by allied soldiers. Recording a verdict of natural death, Hampshire Coroner Andrew Bradley said: 'I would expect this disease in the heart of a 65-year-old, not someone who is 45. 'If your heart is going downhill and you use it more the worse it is going to get. 'This is a degeneration and progressive change. 'He had constant medical check ups with the Army, which showed he was fine. 'It is clearly an ongoing condition. It was not a heart attack this was a degeneration rather than a single event. 'It is sad and very unexpected.'","Lt Col Michael McErlain, 45, collapsed around 2 miles into the 44-mile race .

A pregnant mother who was told her rash was a harmless insect bite, passed on a virus which led to her unborn baby developing meningitis and later cerebral palsy. When Victoria Birtwistle, 38, from Middleton near Manchester, noticed itchy bumps on her abdomen and hips, she presumed they were insect bites. She visited her GP and obstetrician to make sure they were not signs of a more serious problem, but they too believed that she was simply exhibiting the symptoms of a nasty cluster of stings. It was not until her son Lucas, now six, was born that she discovered she had caught the cold sore virus and and passed it on to her unborn baby. When expectant mother Victoria Birtwistle, 38, noticed itchy bumps on her stomach and thighs she and doctors presumed they were insect bites. It would not be until several weeks later that she would discover she had caught the cold core virus and passed it on to her unborn son, Luke, now six . 'When I first saw the rash they looked like horsefly bites and I was just given cream for them,' said Ms Birtwistle, who developed the strange blisters when she was 35-weeks pregnant. 'I didn't have any other symptoms. I suppose I felt quite tired but I was heavily pregnant and I had developed high blood pressure so it seemed natural I wouldn't feel great.' Ms Birtwhistle, who works for British Gas, applied ointment and carried on as normal. But when she gave birth by caesarian section at Fairfield General in Manchester, a seemingly unrelated health emergency occurred. 'When Lucas was delivered he was whisked away because he didn't take his first breath properly - he was totally silent. That moment felt like the longest few minutes of my life,' she said. Lucas eventually started breathing normally and his Apgar score - a measure of a new baby's vital statistics to work out how healthy it is - came out as being very healthy. But that evening Lucas let out an unusual bloodcurdling wail. 'I can't describe how shrill it was - it was like nothing I'd heard before. He sounded as if he was in incredible pain and started to go blue,' Ms Birtwistle said. Ms Birtwistle and her family called for help, but by the time they arrived Luke had returned to normal - he seemed quite happy and was bright pink again. Ms Birtwhistle first noticed there was a problem when Lucas let out a blood-curdling scream and turned blue. he did this several time before doctors realised he was suffering with seizures. It was not until later that they would find it had developed meningitis . Lucas suffered with seizures for many months after he caught the cold sore virus and developed meningitis. The repeated fits have left him cerebral palsy and brain damage . A nurse told Ms Birtwistle that this was common, particularly with babies that had been delivered by C-section. She said that they often had mucous on their lungs and they'd soon stop making the noise and breathe normally. But the shrill scream returned and soon became routine over the next few days. Each time a doctor was a called, staff reassured the new mother that her baby was healthy - especially as he seemed fine by the time they arrived. It was not until Lucas screamed while a doctor was in the room that action was taken. 'The doctor said ""Is that the scream he is making each time?"" and I said it was. At that point he said my baby needed to be taken to intensive care,' remembered Mr Birtwistle. Until recently Luke walked with a specially-made frame which helped to support his weight. He can now walk by himself but is still unable to run or jump . What Ms Birtwistle didn't know was that the sudden shrieks were a sign of infant seizure. Lucas was transferred to North Manchester General Hospital where would spend the following 10 weeks. His health deteriorated rapidly and . the number of seizures had increased. Over the following few days he . experienced between 20 and 30 seizures a day. As a cautionary measure he was put on a cocktail of antibiotics to kill off any infection that might be triggering the seizures, as well a number of anti-epilepsy drugs to stop the fits in the short-term. Doctors carried out a raft of tests on newborn Lucas, but results kept coming back normal. Eventually . they carried out a lumbar puncture which showed that he had traces of . the HSV-1 virus - or cold sore virus - in his body. Despite his ongoing health problems, Lucas loves school (pictured in his uniform). His mother said that his favourite thing to do when at home is to watch people sing - particularly on the X factor, The Voice or on Youtube . Ms Birtwistle said: 'I was totally shocked. How could a newborn have caught the cold sore virus within hours of birth? Not only that, but I'd never had a cold sore in my life.' But the doctor's diagnosis prompted ms Birtwistle to remember the strange rash that had developed several weeks previously. Doctors then concluded that the small red blisters that had spread across the lower half of Ms Birtwistle's body was almost certainly a rare manifestation of the virus. Lucas is pictured here with his scaffolder father Lee Wilson, 34. Doctors said the chances of mother Victoria passing on the virus to her unborn son Lucas were just one in 100,000 . The doctors explained that Ms Birtwhistle must have caught the infection for the first time during her pregnancy and it must have manifested itself in the strange rash. They explained that there was a one in 100,000 chance that she could have passed the virus on to her son. This had in turn caused him to develop meningoencephalitis - a swelling on the parts of the brain called the meninges and the cephalus. It is thought that this swelling or the initial infection that damaged Lucas' brain and caused him to develop cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy is caused by damage to the brain, which normally occurs before, during or soon after birth. Causes of cerebral palsy include infection in early pregnancy, a difficult or premature birth, bleeding in the baby’s brain and  abnormal brain development. Children with cerebral palsy often have other related conditions including epilepsy, learning difficulties and sensory problems such as blindness. Ms Birtwhistle said son Lucas is a very happy boy but that he exhibits slightly obsessive tendencies. He is particularly fond of his school's headteacher, Mr Barnes, who he likes because he uses a megaphone at playtime . Lucas was put on a strong dose of acyclovir - the active compound in many over the counter cold sore . remedies - to fight the infection. Soon after his diagnosis, doctors discovered that Lucas had also developed cerebral palsy when he was unable to clench his fist. Since then Lucas has made slow but steady progress. He has managed to hit his milestones although he didn't crawl until he was 18-months-old and he didn't learn to walk until he was three. But he is happy, Ms Birtwistle said: 'He's never going to be like other kids his age but he's such a cheerful child and that's all that matters.' One charity that has made life much easier for Ms Birtwhistle is Brainwave, a charity that specialises in helping children with disabilities and developmental delays. 'I don't know what I'd have done if I didn't access to them, said Ms Birtwhistle. 'They are so supportive and helped make feel like I know I'm moving in the right direction with Lucas.'","Ms Birtwhistle, 38, developed small blisters in the late stages of pregnancy .

A coroner lashed out at paramedics who refused to get into a water-filled ditch to help a dying man because of health and safety concerns. Road accident victim Michael Thornton was lifted on to dry land only when a policeman arrived, by which time it was too late to save him. At the inquest into the 30-year-old farmer’s death coroner Michael Rose declared: ‘I will not say what I think of health and safety regulations. I was brought up in a country where men risked their lives to save the lives of others.’ Critical: West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose (left) blasted paramedics for not saving drowning man Michael Thornton, 30, (right) because of health and safety fears . Mr Thornton was knocked unconscious . when the Land Rover in which he was a passenger crashed on the Somerset . Levels and flipped into the 10ft-wide drainage ditch. His two friends . managed to haul him on to the side of the upturned vehicle and attempted . to revive him. But they were unable to carry him up . the slippery banks, and when two male paramedics arrived they made a . snap ‘risk assessment’ and refused to get into the water to help. In stark contrast, a policeman who arrived minutes later went straight into the water and pulled Mr Thornton on to the road. His death is the latest in a series of . cases in recent years in which ‘risk assessments’ stopped emergency . crews from going to the aid of victims, in some cases costing lives. Mr Rose, coroner for West Somerset, . said: ‘I was brought up in a country where men risked their own lives to . save the lives of others. That was a period in our history which has . almost ceased. I do praise the actions of Pc Day, who dived in, but by . that stage it was too late.’ Bereft: Michael's father Steve and a woman walk beside the rhyne where their son Michael was fatally injured after the Land Rover he was in crashed . Attack: In a stinging criticism the coroner said: 'I was brought up in a country where men risked their own lives to save the lives of others' At the inquest in Taunton last week, . Mr Rose recorded an accidental death verdict and did not say if Mr . Thornton could have been saved if the paramedics had gone in. The paramedics’ employers insist the . crew had to stay dry to provide ‘advanced life support’ such as . defibrillation, which could have proved fatal for everyone at the scene . if carried out too close to the water. The inquest heard that Mr Thornton, . from East Brent, Somerset, had been drinking with friends Jason Cheal . and Matthew Braddick, 27, at a pub in Brent Knoll before the accident . last November. Mr Braddick was nearly twice over the alcohol limit as he drove them home just after midnight in his Land Rover Discovery. He crashed into the ditch in . Rooksbridge on the Somerset Levels near Weston-super-Mare, claiming . later that he had swerved to avoid an animal in the road. Many unlit roads in the area are lined . by ditches, or ‘rhynes’, which in winter are often filled with water . and can be dangerous to motorists. Mr Braddick was later convicted of . drink-driving and banned from the road for three years but Mr Rose said . he did not think that was the main cause of the accident. He said they had not been doing over . 30mph and may well have swerved to avoid an animal. ‘This is a tragic . case,’ he said. ‘The deceased had his whole life ahead of him.’ The ditch depth was not measured but . is estimated at 5ft, with knee-deep mud at the bottom. The ambulance . response time was not mentioned at the inquest but it was not thought to . have been delayed. The coroner found the primary cause of . death was drowning, coupled with reduced consciousness and a traumatic . head injury, with a secondary cause of intoxication.  Yesterday Mr . Thornton’s family could not be reached for comment. But local Conservative councillor . Peter Burridge-Clayton said: ‘I share some of the coroner’s concerns. I . think we need to see more of a balance between these strict health and . safety laws and letting paramedics do their work. ‘If the legislation wasn’t quite so stringent then perhaps the man could have been saved.’ Paying tribute to Mr Thornton, who had . his own agricultural businesses, his girlfriend Liz Richardson, 35, . said: ‘Michael was a loving, kind and gentle man. His parents and I want . to thank the policeman who tried to save him. ‘Michael is so missed by family and friends. He was a very hard worker and would do anything for anyone.’ At the time of his death last year his . mother Mandy Phillips, 53, said: ‘It still doesn’t seem real and I . expect him to walk back through the door. We will miss him terribly. He . always had a smile on his face.’ South Western Ambulance Trust extended . its condolences but said it was ‘confident the crew made an appropriate . risk assessment and administered the best possible care’. A spokesman added: ‘They would have . been unable to administer any higher standard of life support on an . upturned vehicle, in the middle of the water, than that which was . already being performed by the individual on scene.’ The crew were concerned by the unknown . depth of the water. If one of them got into trouble, it would have . affected the treatment they could provide, the spokesman said. ‘The clinical preference would always . have been to wait for the fire service to rescue the patient from the . water. There is no question the paramedics made exactly the right . choices and performed admirably.’ Tory councillor for neighbouring . Cheddar, Dawn Hill, said: ‘Your natural instinct would be to jump in and . help. It is very sad that health and safety laws stop paramedics from . doing their job.’","Michael Thornton was thrown into a canal after Land Rover overturned .

A new study by psychologists at Stanford University has found that Americans aren't driven by a sense of community. And calls to Americans to act interdependently, rather than independently, could even make things worse. So if you're trying to get people to do something like recycling, it's better to stress that it's good for them individually rather than pointing out the wider benefits. President Obama urged Americans to work together in his inauguration address - but he might have done better stressing the maverick quality of his fellow citizens, according to the Stanford researchers . All in it together? White American students were less motivated when prompted to think about interdependence, the researchers found . 'American culture stresses independence, and the desire for independence fuels behaviour,' says MarYam Hamedani, one of the study's authors. 'People often like the idea of . working together and certainly care about social issues. But our . findings show that thinking about and caring about others doesn't always . translate into effective action.' President Barack Obama urged his fellow citizens to think more about the wider community at his second inauguration last month. Being selfish really does make us happier, researchers have found - so long as we can avoid feeling guilty. Although we are taught the benefits of kindness and altruism, it seems we are happiest when simply told to pursue our own self-interest. Researchers found the key to contentment is feeling we have no choice but to be selfish. In contrast, the study, carried out by psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania, found that those who actively choose a selfish path usually have to battle with guilt. They speculated that because we’re taught as children that ‘sharing means caring’, if we make a decision out of self-interest over others. But that frequently means we forego the things we know will make us happy. Psychological scientists Jonathan Berman and Deborah Small of the . University of Pennsylvania carried out tests to see when people feel . happiest. In one they recruited 216 undergraduates and gave them each 3 dollars. Some were told to donate it to the charity UNICEF, some were told to . keep the money and some participants were told that they could choose . what to do with it. Those students told to keep the money for themselves reported being far . happier with the outcome than those who were told to donate the money . and those who were free to choose. Mr Berman said: 'Often what people really want to do is act in a selfish manner. 'But they don’t do that, because they know they would feel selfish if they did.' The research is published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science. In his speech, he said: 'The American people can no more meet the demands of today's world by acting alone.' But Obama might have been better to appeal to the independently minded Americans as mavericks. The Stanford researchers carried out three challenges to test the participants' motivation. In the first experiment, participants – all Stanford students – were given difficult word puzzles to solve. In the second, they were given a physical challenge to see how long they would stick at it. During both tasks, participants were primed to think either about independence or about interdependence. After the initial priming, the researchers found that white American participants were less motivated to persist at these challenging tasks when they were encouraged to think of the broader good, or interdependence. When working together, the students were less persistent in solving difficult puzzles and applied less physical pressure in a test of their strength. In the third experiment, designed to test these motivational effects in relation to a pressing social issue, students were asked to give their opinions about a class on promoting environmental sustainability after viewing a website about the course. When the course description emphasised working together, being adaptive and taking others' views into account, white American students predicted they would put less effort into the course. They said they were less likely to agree that taking the course should be a university requirement than when the course description emphasised taking charge, being unique and knowing your own perspective. However, the motivation of Asian-American students did not change across the three tasks. The researchers noted that Asian-American students are exposed to both mainstream American culture, which stresses independence, and East Asian culture, which stresses the value and importance of interdependence. As a result, appeals to think and act interdependently or independently were equally motivating. 'Currently, if we want to inspire Americans to think and act interdependently, it may work best to actually emphasize their independence to motivate them to do so,' Hamedani said. 'Tell them, ""Be the change you want to see in the world"" instead of ""We're all in this together"".'","Study says appeals to Americans' individuality more likely to motivate .

Booze: Underage drinkers are using supermarket online delivery services to get alcohol sent to their homes . Children are getting around laws banning underage drinkers by buying alcohol from supermarket online delivery services. Nearly half of underage buyers do not get asked for proof of age on the doorstep at the time of delivery, a report has revealed. A survey of Welsh teenagers aged 14 to 17 found many find it 'easy' to get alcohol delivered to their homes. The alcohol awareness charity Alcohol Concern found 15 per cent had bought alcohol online. While two thirds said they used online shopping to buy alcohol as it was the easiest way to 'bypass ID checks'. All teenagers had to do was agree to the website terms and conditions and use a debit card and email address - and then wait for the alcohol to be dropped off. The survey was carried out in tandem with a police sting operation in which 15-year-olds used supermarket websites to get beer, wine and vodka delivered to their door. In 44 per cent of the test purchases, alcohol was delivered to the underage buyers who answered the door without any requests for proof of age. The South Wales Police operation involved five different supermarkets, tested on two dates in March. Deliver drivers failed to ask the 15-year-old purchasers for proof of age in four out of the nine tests, with one supermarket failing twice. South Wales Police did not disclose which supermarkets had failed the test but all have policies which state they will not deliver to people under 18. Sergeant Scott Lloyd, who led the sting operations, said he was 'disappointed' with the failure rate of supermarket home delivery services and would 'work with the supermarkets' to ensure under-18s cannot access alcohol in this way. Alcohol Concern is calling for supermarkets and other online retailers to review their existing age checking procedures to determine whether they are fit for purpose, following it's On Your Doorstep report. The charity said delivery staff needed robust training in requesting and identifying proof of age. Mark Leyshon, policy and research . officer at Alcohol Concern Cymru in Cardiff, said: 'Retailers offering . home delivery services need to toughen up. 'Their processes need to ensure that children and young people are prevented from accessing alcohol through this channel. 'Buying alcohol online via supermarket websites is unique in that the sale is made in private and with relative anonymity. 'Young . people have told us that these sites offer less robust age verification . practices and provide a quick and easy way to get hold of alcohol, . especially for younger teenagers. 'Alcohol is a potentially addictive and harmful substance, especially for the young, and should be sold and distributed as such.' But the British Retail Consortium, . which represents most of the major supermarkets, said stores took their . obligations not to sell to underage buyers 'seriously'. 'Easy': Two thirds of the teenagers surveyed said they ordered online as it was a way to bypass ID checks (file photo) A spokesman said: 'There are robust systems in place for age-restricted products purchased online, and delivery drivers are trained to ask for ID if they have good reason to believe that age is an issue. 'However, issues occasionally arise as banks are unwilling to identify people under 18 on credit or debit cards, which would be the easiest way of restricting purchases online. 'Parents also have some responsibility for the way in which their own cards are used by their children. 'Any specific evidence of wrongful selling – as opposed to anonymous claims in a survey – can be presented to the retailers concerned who will be most willing to investigate specific examples and ensure their systems are followed.' A Home Office spokesman said: 'We all need to help tackle underage drinking - the police, the public, parents, and the shops and off-licences who sell alcohol. 'The Government will not tolerate under-age selling. It is the responsibility of retailers to ensure those being sold alcohol online are old enough. 'The law has been toughened so those who persistently sell alcohol to children now face a £20,000 fine.'","Police test finds 44 per cent of delivery drivers don't check ID of 15-year-olds .

A bride who was born a man has found happiness with a groom who was born a woman after meeting at a transgender support group. Felix Laws and Helen Morfitt, from Hull, who have both changed sex, hope their love story will give hope to other people struggling with gender identity. Helen, 56, who was born a boy called Leslie, told The Mirror: 'It might seem a bit strange to people on the outside but as far as we’re concerned we’re just like any other man and woman in love. Finally found happiness: Helen Morfitt and Felix Laws will tie the knot this September . 'We’ve been through a lot over the years and had tough times transitioning from one sex to another, but we’ve now found each other and that’s all that matters.' Helen, who is now a support worker at Lincoln University, met Felix, 46, in 2008 when he attended a transgender support group she had set up to help people struggling with their gender like she had. 'There . are a lot of barriers, both socially and psychologically, in the way of . people wanting to switch gender, so I wanted to help others overcome . them using my experience,' she told the Hull Daily Mail. Before she had her sex change operation ten years ago, Helen had married three times and had eight children. She admits it was a very stressful time as she was 'trying to deny who I really was – a woman in a man's body.' The couple met at a transgender support group Helen had set up to help people struggling with their identity . Helen said she remains friends with two of her exes and explained her sex change operation to her children before she went ahead with it. She said: 'I was incredibly ill by then because of the stress. I told my two youngest, who were only five and six, that I was very poorly and the only way I could get better was to become a girl. They accepted it easily.' Meanwhile Felix, a school teaching assistant who was born as a woman called Katy, was struggling with his identity. He said: 'I'd known from the age of eight that I should have been born a boy. My friends were playing with dolls and prams but I wanted to climb trees, play football and get muddy.' Real love: Between them they have ten children and four marriages but the pair say they've finally got romance right after changing their sexes . In a bid to try and repress his feelings, Felix married at the age of 21 and had two sons. While he loved his sons very much, he left them to live with their father when they were aged 10 and 12 because he was struggling so much with his desire to be a man. After he sought help from his GP, Helen's support group was recommended to him and it was there that he met her and they fell in love. He had a full sex change in 2009 and popped the question to Helen in 2011. They will tie the knot in Gretna Green in September. 'I’ve been married three times before but this time I know it’s for real because I know I’m the right sex this time,' Helen said.","Felix Laws had sex change in 2009 after he was born as a woman .

A couple who beat a toddler so severely it was left with two broken arms, a broken right leg and a broken left foot have been spared jail because it was their first offence. Emma Cartwright and partner Neil Gleaves, both 27, then left the child's broken leg untreated for 'at least two days' before taking the toddler to hospital. Cartwright was also convicted of slapping a baby in the face before Gleaves violently shook it. Spared jail: Emma Cartwright, 27, and her partner Neil Gleaves, also 27, were given a 36 week prison sentence suspended for two years after being convicted of child cruelty and neglect . The couple were convicted of child cruelty and neglect at Stoke Crown Court on Thursday but walked free after a judge heard it was their first offence and Gleaves was 'hardworking'. Instead, the couple from Wolstanton, Staffordshire, were given a 36 week prison sentence suspended for two years with a supervision order. Gleaves was also ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work. Recorder Simon Ward told them: 'You’ve both been convicted of very serious offences and you’re going to have to live with the consequences. 'Offences of cruelty and ill-treatment of children are so serious that the courts have to send out a message to people that, if convicted, serious sentences will follow.' The court heard the couple attacked the toddler who was taken to University Hospital of North Staffordshire with serious injuries. Staff found the toddler's leg had been broken for at least two days before she was brought in to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire . On arriving at hospital shocked medics found the child’s right leg had been broken at least two days earlier. David Bennett, prosecuting, said: 'Neither defendant could account for how that injury was caused. The medical staff were concerned and a full radiological survey was carried out. 'The whole body was X-rayed and it was discovered the child had a number of significant injuries to its bones. 'The child had fractures to both arms, both legs, left foot and left shoulder, all of which, it was deemed by the medical staff, were non-accidental injuries and were caused deliberately to the child.' The couple were spared jail after the judge heard how the defendants had no previous convictions. Nick Tatlow, defending, also said Cartwright had experienced a 'troubled' past and had been cared for by 14 different foster families as a child. He said: 'Her actions amounted to a temporary loss of temper.' Anis Ali, defending Gleaves added: 'He is, and was, a hard-working individual. He understands the consequences of this conviction will last forever.'","Child had a broken leg for at least two days before it was taken to hospital .

The earliest surviving portrait of the king is pictured . A group of relatives of King Richard III, whose body was unearthed in a council car park last year, have won the right to bring High Court proceedings to challenge a plan to rebury his remains in Leicester. Many of his relatives want the body buried in York, claiming it was the King’s wish. A High Court judge in London urged the relatives and other parties involved to act with dignity in deciding the King's final resting place or risk embarking on a new legal War of the Roses. The judge gave permission to the Plantagenet Alliance to bring judicial review proceedings against the Justice Secretary and the University of Leicester. Richard III was killed at the battle of Bosworth in 1485 and was hurriedly buried in the church of the Greyfriars in Leicester, which was subsequently lost during redevelopment. Mr Justice Haddon-Cave, in granting permission for a hearing later in the year, said: 'The archaeological discovery of the mortal remains of a former King of England after 500 years is without precedent. 'In my judgment, it is plainly arguable that there was a duty at common law to consult widely as to how and where Richard III’s remains should appropriately be re-interred. 'I grant permission to the claimant to bring judicial review proceedings against the Secretary of State for Justice and the University of Leicester on all grounds.' Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said: 'It is ironic that the Wars of the Roses appear to be returning whence they started - the Temple. Richard III was killed at the battle of Bosworth in 1485 and was hurriedly buried in the church of the Greyfriars in Leicester, which was subsequently lost during redevelopment . 'Legend has it that John Beaufort and Richard Plantagenet picked the symbolic red and white roses in Inner and Middle Temple gardens...I would, however, urge the parties to avoid embarking on the (legal) Wars of the Roses Part 2. 'In my view, it would be unseemly, undignified and unedifying to have a legal tussle over these royal remains.This would not be appropriate, or in the country’s interests.' He said the discovery of the skeleton also involves the royal family, state and church and recommended passing over the responsibility of deciding where Richard III should be buried to an independent advisory panel made up of experts and Privy Councillors. Richard III’s remains were discovered buried under a municipal car park owned by Leicester City Council. Archaeologists from the University of Leicester were granted permission to excavate the car park and to decide where the bones should be reburied by the Ministry of Justice and agreed that the remains should be re-interred at Leicester Cathedral. A High Court judge in London urged the relatives and other parties involved to act with dignity in deciding the King's final resting place or risk embarking on a new legal War of the Roses. His skeleton is pictured . However, opponents argue that he would . have wanted to be put to rest at York Minster as the king grew up at . Middleham Castle in the Yorkshire Dales and visited York several times . during his 26-month reign. Known as Richard of York before his coronation, he also funded part of the city’s medieval gated walls. The alliance is a 'campaigning organisation' incorporated in March by the 17th great-nephew of Richard III, Stephen Nicolay. In a written ruling the judge said: 'In my judgment the merits of the claimant’s challenge are clearly arguable.' The “core submission” of the alliance’s case 'is that the Secretary of State for Justice had a duty in law to consult ‘relevant interests', including descendants, as to how, and where, the remains of Richard III should be reburied, but he failed to comply with that duty prior to issuing the licence or at any time thereafter'. The alliance submitted the 'relevant interests' including the wishes of Richard III himself 'in so far as they can be ascertained or inferred'. Relatives of Richard III argue he would have wanted to be put to rest at York Minster as the king grew up at Middleham Castle in the Yorkshire Dales and visited York several times during his 26-month reign. Philippa Langley, originator of the 'Looking for Richard III' project is pictured with a reconstruction of the king's face . It was a matter which has raised a 'great deal of strong public feeling', said the judge, particularly in the two main geographical areas which assert historical claims as to where Richard should be reburied. A total of 26,553 people have signed a petition that the remains should be re-interred at York Minster and 8,115 people have signed a petition that they should be re-interred at Leicester. The judge concluded that the issues in the case “are of general public importance” and that “the public interest requires that these issues are resolved”. The University of Leicester announced that DNA results confirmed the remains were those of Richard III in February 4 this year. The university said in a statement: 'The university continues to take the view that the claim is without merit and that this is the conclusion which the court is likely to reach once it has had the benefit of hearing detailed evidence and legal argument during the course of the judicial review. It added: 'Statistically, it is expected there will be at least a million relatives of Richard III alive today' and said it has received messages of support from Michael Ibsen, whose DNA was key to identifying the remains found at Greyfriars in Leicester. The location of Richard II's final is a matter that has raised a 'great deal of strong public feeling', according to the judge, particularly in the two main geographical areas which assert historical claims as to where Richard III should be reburied. The illustration depicting the Battle of Bosworth shows Richard III on a white horse . The Battle of Bosworth Field was fought on the morning of August 22, 1485, and marked the end of the War Of The  Roses, the 30-year civil war between the houses of York and Lancaster. One of the most important clashes in English history, it saw the death of Richard III, ushered in the Tudor dynasty and gave Shakespeare one of his best known quotations. The battle marked the final confrontation between the Yorkist king Richard III and his challenger Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond and leader of the House of Lancaster. The seeds of Richard's downfall were sown when he seized the throne from his 12-year-old nephew Edward V in 1483. Support for the monarch was further diminished when Edward and his younger brother disappeared and Richard was involved in the death of his wife. Henry laid claim to the throne from across the Channel. Following an unsuccessful attempt to invade England from his base in France, Henry arrived on the coast of Wales on August 1, 1485. Gathering support as he marched inland, Richard hurriedly mustered troops and intercepted Henry's army south of Market Bosworth in Leicestershire. After Richard's death on the battlefield his rival was crowned King Henry VII and became the first English monarch of the Tudor dynasty, which lasted until 1603.","Relatives of Richard III have won the right to launch High Court proceedings in a bid to have the king's remains re-interred in York Minster .

Major League Baseball is expected to seek suspensions in the coming weeks against 20 players, among them Yankees star Alex Rodriguez, for their connection to a Miami area clinic at the center of the doping scandal. Tony Bosch, the founder of the now-closed Biogenesis of America, agreed to cooperate with MLB's investigation, sources told ESPN's Outside the Line, giving the league the green light to move ahead with the suspensions. If the suspensions are upheld, the MLB doping scandal would be the largest in American sports history, comparable only to the 1919 'Black Sox fiasco,' in which eight players from the Chicago White Sox were banned from baseball for life for intentionally losing games to allow the Cincinnati  Reds to win the World Series. Scroll down for video . Careers in jeopardy: Yankees' Alex Rodriguez (left) and Brewers' Ryan Braun (right) are among 20 MLB players who could be looking at 100-game suspensions for their alleged ties to a Miami clinic . Notorious: The now-closed Biogenesis of America clinic in Miami is a the center of MLB's massive performance-enhancing drug scandal . The commissioner's office might seek as many as 100-game suspensions against Rodriguez, the Boston Brewers' Ryan Braun and others for their suspected connection to the clinic and their denial of the use of performance-enhancing drugs. MLB officials reportedly have clinic records listing the names of about 20 players that Bosch could confirm when he meets with them next week. Ryan Braun                           Brewers .

Cesar Puello                          Mets . Alex Rodriguez                       Yankees . In a recent interview with ESPN, Bosch pleaded ignorance regarding PEDs and claimed that  media accounts accusing him of distributing illegal substances among players amounted to 'character assassination.' 'I have been accused, tried and convicted in the media. And so I think [I] have been falsely accused throughout the media,' he told ESPN's Pedro Gomez. 'I've done nothing wrong.' According to Outside the Line, Bosch's claims that he had nothing to do with PEDs are at odds with accounts from numerous sourced who said he helped provide banned substances to possible dozens of athletes. In exchange for Bosch's cooperation, MLB has agreed to drop the lawsuit it filed against him in March. However, Bosch also could be facing a criminal investigation. He recently received a cease-and-desist letter from the Florida State Department of Health, which referred the case to law enforcement. Bosch's name first surfaced in 2009 after then-Los Angeles Dodgers player Manny Ramirez tested positive for testosterone. MLB officials reviewed Ramirez's medical file and discovered a prescription for human chorionic gonadotropin, which was written out by Bosch's father, Dr Pedro Bosch. Ramirez was suspended for 50 games and was sidelined a second time for 100 games in 2011 after he failed another doping test. Bosch appeared on MLB’s radar a second time last summer in connection to Melky Cabrera, Bartolo Colon and Yasmani Grandal, who also tested positive for testosterone and received 50-game suspensions during the 2012 season, the Chicago Tribune reported. Center of attention: Rodriguez (center) speaks to reporters after arriving at the Yankees' minor league baseball complex in Tampa, Florida last month . ESPN also reported that MLB is working to determine whether Yankees second baseman Robinson Cano was also linked to Bosch and his clinic. A spokesperson for the player's foundation is listed in clinic records. In April, it was revealed that Rodriguez reportedly tried to purchase documents from the Miami clinic in order to keep them from MLB officials. Rodriguez allegedly had an intermediary purchase the papers from the Biogenesis clinic in Miami. After officials in the MLB front office learned of this deal, they rushed to buy copies of the documents as well, which purport to show ties to performance-enhancing drugs. Coverup?: New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez reportedly tried to purchase documents from an anti-aging clinic that has alleged ties to performance-enhancing substances . Rodriguez's purchase was first reported by the New York Times. The New Times said it obtained records detailing purchases by Rodriguez, 2012 All-Star game MVP Melky Cabrera, 2005 AL Cy Young Award winner Bartolo Colon and 2011 AL championship series MVP Nelson Cruz. Its exposé claimed the baseball star received cocktails including Human Growth Hormones (HGH) and testosterone creams on a fairly regular basis, according to handwritten notes viewed by someone familiar with the clinic. Rodriguez's name appears in handwritten notes, reportedly kept by Bosch's clinic, that indicate he received various substances from 2009 up until 2012. 'There was his name, over and over again, logged as either 'Alex Rodriguez', 'Alex Rod', or his nickname at the clinic, 'Cacique,' a pre-Columbian Caribbean chief. Rodriguez’s name appears 16 times throughout,' according to the article. Rodriguez has denied the claims. 'I have nothing to hide': Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers is also being investigated for his links to the Florida clinic which is now closed. He has said his name appears in records because of a payment dispute . Other baseball players the newspaper said appeared in the records include Gio Gonzalez and Yasmani Grandal. Later, Yahoo Sports reported that 2011 NL MVP Ryan Braun's name also appeared in the records. Braun subsequently issued a statement . saying: 'I have nothing to hide.' He has said his name appeared because . of an issue over payment for consultancy work relating to his . successful fight to overturn a 2011 doping ban. Washington Nationals star pitcher Gio Gonzalez's name reportedly appeared in records at an anti-aging clinic with alleged ties to performance-enhancing drugs . Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig has declined to comment on Biogenesis, other than to say it is the subject of a 'very thorough investigation' by MLB. Lawsuit: Anthony Bosch faces a claim for unspecified damages after he was accused of doling out banned substances at his Miami clinic . The Times said the payments by the commissioner's office did not exceed more than 'several thousand dollars.' MLB officials decided to take the unusual step of paying for the documents because, with no subpoena power, its investigators would likely have no access to the material if it wound up in the players' hands, the paper reported. Last month, Major League Baseball sued Biogenesis, and its operators, accusing them of scheming to provide banned performance-enhancing drugs to players in violation of their contracts. The lawsuit in Miami-Dade Circuit Court seeks unspecified damages from Biogenesis and its operator, Anthony Bosch. Several other Bosch associates are named in the lawsuit. Among the banned drugs supplied, the lawsuit said, are testosterone, human growth hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin. Baseball officials also unsuccessfully lobbied New Times editors to share the documents that formed the basis of their story.","New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez among those claimed to be involved with the now-defunct Biogenesis clinic in Miami .

Free at last: Youcef Nadarkhani, 34, spent three years in an Iranian prison waiting to be executed for apostasy . An Iranian Christian pastor who was originally sentenced to death for holding on to his faith in the Islamic fundamentalist country was acquitted of apostasy charges and released from prison on Saturday. Youcef Nadarkhani, 34, spent three years behind bars waiting to be executed to refusing to renounce Christianity. His charges were lowered to evangelizing to Muslims, which carried a three-year sentence. He was released from custody with time served, according to the American Center for Law and Justice, a Washington-based watchdog group that had been campaigning for the pastor's release. ‘After languishing in prison for almost three years, he has been reunited with his family,’ Jordan Sekulow, executive director of ACLJ said in a statement to FoxNews.com. ‘Pastor Youcef’s story is an example of how the world can join together to ensure that justice is served and freedom preserved.’ Nadarkhani was arrested in his home city of Rasht in 2009 soon after calling into question the Muslim monopoly on religious education of children, which he felt was unconstitutional, according to Christian Solidarity Worldwide. Religious freedom: Nadarkhani was arrested in 2009 for questioning the Muslim monopoly of religious instruction for children . Reunited: The married father of two was able to finally meet with his wife and children after three years behind bars . Nadarkhani, who converted to Christianity at age 19, also wanted to register a home-based church. He was sentenced to death for apostasy in 2010, a decision that was upheld by the country’s Supreme Court in 2011. Although the Iranian penal code did not specify death for apostasy, a constitutional loophole allowed judges to refer to Sharia law to justify such a sentence. False alarm: It was feared that Nadarkhani might face new charges on Saturday . Earlier in the week, it was reported that Nadarkhani may face new, unspecified charges during the Saturday hearing, but he was instead released. Nadarkhani's attorney, who also has been jailed, said that that the married father of two faced the death penalty because he refused to renounce his faith. A breakthrough in the pastor’s case signalling a likely positive outcome came earlier this year when an Iranian diplomat told a United Nations panel that Nadarkhani would not be executed. The ACLJ worked with the State Department to try to spring Nadarkhani free, and the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution earlier this year condemning his imprisonment and calling for his immediate release. Nearly three million people have voiced support for Nadarkhani online through the 'Tweet for Youcef' campaign. President Barack Obama, EU foreign policy . chief Catherine Ashton and the governments of Germany, Britain and . France, had all called on the Iranian government to release Nadarkhani, . according to the Jerusalem Post. While the ACLJ praised the pastor’s release, the organization was quick to point out that it was international attention to the high-profile case that forced Iranian officials to release him, and that the Middle Eastern country is poised to continue its pattern of religious suppression. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom has classifies Iran as a 'country of concern' since 1999.

An unemployed Iraqi 'benefit queen' charged £4,000 a week to sublet a taxpayer funded £2million flat, it has been claimed. Bushra al-Rahimi is claimed to have rented out the flat to a family of Kuwaiti tourists, while also being in receipt of housing benefits from Westminster city council to cover the cost of the city centre five-bedroom property. Al-Rahimi and her family have now been re-housed at taxpayers' expense in nearby Islington, in a block of flats where another property is let at £5,000 a month. Bushra al-Rahimi is claimed to have charged £4,000 a week to rent out the flat at Harrowby Court (pictured) to a family of Kuwaiti tourists, while also being in receipt of housing benefits . The alleged offence came to light after director of Lord Estates Hany Hanna was asked to intervene by the head lessor of the flats at Harrowby Court, in a street near Marble Arch, the Sunday Times has reported. Mr Hanna said when he called at the flat, which is close to Tony Blair’s home in Connaught Square, in the first week of July 2011 a man claiming to be the rightful tenant opened the door - in an e-mail to the head lessor Anthony Slingsby, Mr Hanna said he could tell by his accent he was from Kuwait. He said he heard the man talking on the phone after he shut the door and was later called by al-Rahimi who asked him to leave. He accused her of committing a fraud and warned her the matter had been reported to Seymour police station. Mr Hanna, who claims he was told by police the case was a civil, rather than a criminal, matter,  last week said the man in the flat told him he was paying £4,000 a week rent when he told him to leave. Al-Rahimi and her four children moved back into the flat, but she was accused again of unauthorised subletting on December 23. According to the Sunday Times, when the flat's owner, Jean-Francois Destexhe, 42, a multi-millionaire based in Hong Kong, visited the property he found two young Frenchmen paying £800 to £1,000 a week to share a single bedroom. The flat al-Rahimi is alleged to have subletted is close to Tony Blair's home in Connaught Square (pictured) In March 2012 he instructed solicitors to evict al-Rahimi, who is believed to receive jobseeker's allowance of £71 a week, and an order for possession was granted by the Central London county court in October that same year - she was ordered to pay £30,800 in rent arrears, although Destexhe says he is still owed the money. Mr Destexhe said he did not feel he should criticise because he is an overseas resident, but admitted he did not understand, 'why a government would feel it needs every council, including the ones situated in the most expensive areas of Europe, to carry the burden of accommodating these people under the welfare system'. Lindsey Hall, Westminster city council’s anti-fraud tsar, said it was investigating 'for possible illegal subletting last year, and those investigations are continuing'.

Mission scientists today confirmed the probe is 'in a new region' - although scientists are continuing to debate . whether Voyager 1 has reached interstellar space or entered a separate, . undefined region beyond the solar system. Nasa's Voyager 1 probe has finally left the solar system, mission scientists have confirmed . Nasa's . robotic space probes Voyager 1 and 2, both weighing 1,592 lb (722 kg), . prepared for launch in 1977 on missions to locate and study the outer . Solar System and eventually interstellar space. Voyager 2 launched on August 20, 1977, before Voyager 1. Voyager 1 launched on September 5, 1977 moving faster than its sister probe and eventually passing it. On . June 15, 2012, NASA scientists reported that Voyager 1 may be very . close to entering interstellar space and becoming the first man-made . object to leave the Solar System. Voyager 2 will have to be turned off by 2020, and Voyager 1 will have to be turned off by 2025. The results confirm the probe has left the heliosphere. The heliosphere is a region of space dominated by the Sun and its . wind of energetic particles, and which is thought to be enclosed, . bubble-like, in the surrounding interstellar medium of gas and dust that . pervades the Milky Way galaxy. On August 25, 2012, NASA’s Voyager 1 . spacecraft measured drastic changes in radiation levels, more than 11 . billion miles from the Sun. Anomalous cosmic rays, which are . cosmic rays trapped in the outer heliosphere, all but vanished, dropping . to less than 1 percent of previous amounts. At the same time, galactic cosmic rays - cosmic radiation from outside of the solar system - spiked to . levels not seen since Voyager’s launch, with intensities as much as . twice previous levels. The findings have been accepted for publication in Geophysical Research Letters, a journal of the American Geophysical Union. 'Within . just a few days, the heliospheric intensity of trapped radiation . decreased, and the cosmic ray intensity went up as you would expect if . it exited the heliosphere,' said Bill Webber, professor emeritus of . astronomy at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces. He calls this . transition boundary the 'heliocliff.' In the article, the . authors state: 'It appears that [Voyager 1] has exited the main solar . modulation region, revealing [hydrogen] and [helium] spectra . characteristic of those to be expected in the local interstellar . medium.' However, Webber said scientists are continuing to . debate whether Voyager 1 has reached interstellar space or entered a . separate, undefined region beyond the solar system. 'It’s outside . the normal heliosphere, I would say that,' Webber said. 'We’re in a new . region. And everything we’re measuring is different and exciting.' The . 'magnetic highway': Here the sun's magnetic field lines are connected . to interstellar magnetic field lines, allowing particles from inside the . heliosphere to zip away and particles from interstellar space to zoom . in . Late last year researchers said NASA's long-running Voyager 1 . spacecraft has entered a new layer of the solar system that scientists . hadn't known was there, researchers say. Scientists have dubbed this region the . ‘magnetic highway’ and say it's the last stop before interstellar . space, or the space between stars. 'We do believe this may be the very last layer between us and interstellar space,’ said Edward Stone, Voyager project scientist based at the California Institute of Technology, in Pasadena, California. ‘This region was not anticipated, was not predicted.’ Therefore, it's hard to determine how soon the spacecraft will leave the solar system altogether, Stone said at the time. ‘It may take two months, it may take two years,’ he added. The outer limits: This artist's concept shows NASA's two Voyager spacecraft exploring a turbulent region of space known as the heliosheath, the outer shell of the bubble of charged particles around our Sun . Space weather: Voyager is bathed in solar wind from the southern hemisphere flowing northward . In a release, Nasa said it was referring to this new region as a magnetic highway for charged particles because our Sun's magnetic field lines are connected there to interstellar magnetic field lines. This connection allows lower-energy charged particles from inside our heliosphere - the bubble of charged particles the Sun blows around itself - to zoom out, and allows higher-energy particles from outside to stream in. Before entering this region, the charged particles bounced around in all directions, as if trapped on local roads inside the heliosphere. It was data taken from Voyager's low-energy charged particle instrument that showed it first entered the magnetic highway region in July. The instrument includes a stepper motor that turns the platform on which the sensors are mounted, so that the field of view rotates through 360 degrees. This motor was tested for 500,000 steps, enough to reach the orbit of Saturn, and has now completed over 6 million steps. The old-fashioned capacitor bank underneath the motor stores energy needed to provide a 15.7-watt pulse every 192 seconds. However, because the direcrtion of the magnetic field lines has remained the same, the Voyager team believed the new region is still inside our solar bubble. They predict the direction of these magnetic field lines will change when the craft breaks out into interstellar space. Since December 2004, when Voyager 1 crossed a point in space called the termination shock, the spacecraft has been exploring the heliosphere's outer layer, called the heliosheath. In this region, the stream of charged particles from the sun, known as the solar wind, abruptly slowed down from supersonic speeds and became turbulent. Voyager 1's environment was consistent for about five and a half years. The spacecraft then detected that the outward speed of the solar wind slowed to nothing. The intensity of the magnetic field also began to increase at that time. Data from two instruments aboard . voyager that measure charged particles showed it first entered the . magnetic highway region on July 28 last year. The . region ebbed away and flowed toward Voyager 1 several times. The . spacecraft entered the region again August 25 and the environment has . been stable since. 'If we . were judging by the charged particle data alone, I would have thought we . were outside the heliosphere,' said Stamatios Krimigis, chief scientist . on the low-energy charged particle instrument. 'But . we need to look at what all the instruments are telling us and only . time will tell whether our interpretations about this frontier are . correct.' Spacecraft data . revealed the magnetic field became stronger each time Voyager entered . the highway region; however, the direction of the magnetic field lines . did not change. 'We are in a . magnetic region unlike any we've been in before - about ten times more . intense than before the termination shock - but the magnetic field data . show no indication we're in interstellar space,' said Leonard Burlaga, a . member of the team that looks after Voyager's magnetometer. 'The . magnetic field data turned out to be the key to pinpointing when we . crossed the termination shock. And we expect these data will tell us . when we first reach interstellar space.' Voyager 1 and its sister probe Voyager 2 launched 35 years ago on a tour of the outer planets. Voyager . 2 launched on August 20, 1977, about two weeks before Voyager 1. It is . now 9billion miles from the sun. Voyager 1 launched on September 5, . 1977, moving faster than its sister probe and eventually passing it. It is now more than 11 billion miles from the sun. The signal from Voyager 1 takes approximately 17 hours to travel to Earth. After hurtling into space, both probes have continued to travel toward the fringes of the solar system. Interstellar missions: A map of the Voyager tours through outer space . Saturn: an image of the sixth planet taken by Voyager 2 . Neptune: An image of the eight planet taken by Voyager 2 . The Voyagers are NASA's longest-running spacecraft, and will continue traveling after they have left the solar system. As . soon as Voyager 1 breaks through to interstellar space, it will be the . first man-made object to leave the solar system, Stone said. However, it would take at least 40,000 years before either probe came close to another star, Stone said. Long before that both Voyagers will run out of power and transmit their findings back home before shutting off for good. ‘We . will have enough power for all the instruments until 2020; at that . point we will have to turn off our first instrument,’ Stone said.

A new 'stealth tax' assault on Britain's 34million motorists is set to hit drivers of the greenest cars, the Daily Mail can reveal. The move to 'reform' Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) will tighten the tax screw on drivers by increasing  the amount of revenue all motorists have to pay – whether their cars are green or gas-guzzlers. The assault was signalled by Chancellor George Osborne in the small print of the last Budget though not mentioned in his Budget speech. 'Sinister': George Osborne, left, signalled the move in the small print of the last Budget, and Treasure minister Chloe Smith, right, outlined it to MPs last week . Treasury minister Chloe Smith last week told MPs debating rip-off fuel prices and calling for the ditching of controversial 3p duty rise in August that they were 'considering whether vehicle Excise duty should be reformed to support the sustainability of public finances and to reflect the improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency.' The AA said the changes sound 'sinister' and warned drivers to brace themselves for more pain. The motoring group also believe the shake-up is tied to the Prime Minister's controversial plans to privatise the main motorways and trunk roads in England – paying a proportion of the road tax collected to private companies who win the franchise to run them. The will also be allowed to raise tolls on any new roads or lanes they create. Chancellor George Osborne did not mention the shake-up in his Budget speech. But the Daily Mail can reveal that the plan is outlined in one brief paragraph on page 70 of the Treasury 'red book' setting out Government intentions. It says: 'The Government will consider whether to reform VED over the medium term to ensure that all motorists continue to make a contribution to the sustainability of the public finances, and to reflect continuing improvements in vehicle efficiency.' Taxes for vehicles were first introduced in the 1888 budget – before the first motor cars hit the road. Flat rate vehicle excise duty was ring fenced for spending on road construction from 1920. But this ended in 1937, after which it became a cash cow for funding other areas of government spending. The government started to levy varying taxes on cars depending on their CO2 ratings in March 2005. Ministers claimed it was to encourage people to buy cleaner cars. It was reformed along a sliding scale of 13 bands -  from zero to more than £1,000 - and follows the principle that 'the polluter pays.' The more a car pollutes - based on emissions of carbon dioxide CO2 per kilometre driven - the more the driver pays. The beauty of the system from a Treasury perspective is that the cleaner cars become, the more it can tighten the screw. Green car of the year: Drivers of cars like the . Vauxhall Ampera face taxes on the vehicles being hiked as more . environmentally friendly vehicles go on sale . The Treasury told the Daily Mail it had ruled out a return to the original 'flat rate' road tax for cars and said it would be consulting with motoring groups on reform. But the AA says there are two key clues to the Government's intention. It highlights the Treasury desire 'to ensure that all motorists continue to make a contribution to the sustainability of the public finances.' That suggests drivers of even the cleanest vehicles could lose their tax exempted status, and that the level of tax paid at each level will rise. The call 'to reflect continuing improvements in vehicle efficiency' also suggests the tax screw will be ratcheted up to account of the  fact that ever-cleaner cars mean that yesterday's 'green' car is tomorrow's 'gas-guzzler.' Vehicles are currently divided into 13 'bands'. From April 1 drivers of the least polluting vehicles in 'Band A' below 100g/km pay nothing. Those in Band B between 101g and 110g/km pay £20. This rises steeply to top 'Band M' where drivers of cars in excess of 255g/km  will pay £475 – though in the first year of ownership this soars to £1,030 as a further disincentive. But AA spokesman Paul Watters pointed out that many mainstream diesel cars already have sub-100g/km  emissions – and therefore pay no tax. There are currently 57,000 vehicles in this zero bracket, nearly 500,000 in Band B and more than a million in Band C. Public highways? The AA believes the new tax hikes are linked to David Cameron's controversial plans to privatise the motorways and trunk roads . Mr Watters said:'The Governmnent is . going to tighten the tax screw. Cars are getting cleaner so the Treasury . risks losing tax. Tightening the Bands is one way to ratchet up the . income. 'They can't have too many cars which are clean and tax free. So they may scrap the tax-free status for the cleanest cars.' But he added:' The timing is also key. The Prime Minister has raised the spectre of privatised motorways and trunk roads. He suggested they would receive a proportion of the road fund licence. To do that he might have to reform vehicle excise duty.' He added: 'Rising fuel prices mean people are driving less so the Government is getting less fuel tax. This may be a way to plug the gap. It's a bit sinister. We'll be disappointed if they ratche up the  tax'. Labour's Shadow Transport Minister John Woodcock MP said: 'Instead of tackling the soaring price of fuel, the Chancellor has hidden plans for another stealth tax hike on motorists in the small print of the budget. 'The Conservative-led government must come clean about how much extra they plan to charge hard-pressed motorists by whacking up the rate of vehicle exercise duty.' A Treasury spokesman said:'We are asking questions. We are consulting.'","Treasury will tighten the screw on drivers by increasing taxes on greener models to maintain revenue .

The wife of actor Andrew Sachs criticised the BBC last night for an interview with Russell Brand in which he blamed the Sachsgate scandal on ‘dishonest’ reporting. Melody Sachs said yesterday’s edition of flagship Radio 4 programme Desert Island Discs featuring the comedian was ‘very, very nasty to hear’ and an ‘insult’ to her husband. And she accused the corporation of helping Brand promote his new comedy tour by allowing him on a string of recent programmes, including Question Time and The Andrew Marr Show. Brand used his radio appearance to provide his own version of the 2008 scandal, in which he and presenter Jonathan Ross left a series of obscene messages on Mr Sachs’s answerphone during Brand’s Radio 2 programme. The incident provoked 42,000 complaints after Brand boasted of sleeping with Mr Sachs’s granddaughter and joked that the 83-year-old former Fawlty Towers star might hang himself as a result of the phone calls. Brand later resigned while Ross was suspended. But interviewed by Desert Island Discs presenter Kirsty Young, 38-year-old Brand suggested the controversy was manufactured by the Daily Mail and media outlets with a ‘pre-existing agenda’. Brand insisted he is now ‘contrite’, but Mrs Sachs said last night: ‘He didn’t apologise. It was a pathetic little rendition of what actually happened. ‘And the thing that upset me the most was that he claimed people weren’t upset by what he and Jonathan Ross did to Andrew. He said it was the Daily Mail which had whipped up public opinion. That simply isn’t true. People were very upset because of the terrible abuse we endured.’ Tasteless: Russell Brand, left, and Jonathan Ross singing an apology to Andrew Sachs on Radio 2 . Criticising the BBC’s decision to invite Brand on Desert Island Discs, the 79-year-old added: ‘What we had to listen to was disgusting and unnecessary. It was very, very nasty to hear. Andrew has spent a lifetime working at the BBC. This was an insult.’ Brand has appeared on a string of BBC programmes since announcing his Messiah Complex world tour last month, including Question Time, The Andrew Marr Show and the Radio 1 breakfast show. Criticising the BBC for giving him so much airtime, Mrs Sachs said: ‘A lot of water has passed under the bridge since that humiliating phone call and, knowing how the BBC always look after their own, I am surprised that they consider Russell Brand to be one of them. ‘My husband and I are rather surprised that he’s got away with it. We try not to think about what happened and remember the hundreds of letters of support we received at the time. But he did not apologise [on Desert Island Discs].’ Further controversy: Russell Brand suggested it was a 'dishonest scandal' that was hijacked by those against the BBC . During his Radio 4 appearance, Brand insisted he was sorry for making the notorious phone call, saying: ‘I am contrite. Anything that damages something I love, I’m going to feel sorry for. 'And I feel sorry also because the story I tell myself, of myself, is not that I’m a man that is rude to people who are in a position of vulnerability.’ But he said the subsequent controversy was the product of ‘a pre-existing agenda in privately owned media to destabilise, attack and diminish the BBC’. Despite admitting that those who complained in the wake of the scandal were genuinely offended, he added: ‘That was a dishonest scandal... The thing that the 42,000 people were offended by is offensive. It is offensive if someone calls up an answerphone, does some swearing, hangs up. 'But if incrementally that act is led to by a series of innuendos and in-jokes, then it’s a different thing. It’s still a thing that is wrong, but it’s not the thing that they’re offended by.’ Following the Sachsgate scandal the BBC was fined £150,000 by Ofcom, the controller of Radio 2 resigned and the BBC issued multiple on-air apologies. Last night a BBC spokesman said: ‘Desert Island Discs features a range of people from scientists to politicians, academics and actors. Kirsty asks and challenges the castaways about the defining and at times controversial moments in their lives, as she did on this occasion as well.’","Russell Brand, 38, left obscene messages on Andrew Sachs' machine .

Christopher Johnston was working as a longline fisherman in the Indian Ocean when a pregnant blue shark was hauled aboard  somewhere between 200 and 900 . miles off West Australia in September, 2008. When he cut open the creature, the freak foetus was discovered inside. He decided to share the photographs after scientists confirmed the discovery of a different two-headed bull shark foetus, off the coast of Mexico. Never seen before pictures of a two headed shark have been revealed by an American fisherman . Christopher Johnston, a former longline fisherman, discovered the shark foetus inside a pregnant blue shark was hauled in on September 27, 2008 . It was the first time the condition had ever been recorded in a bull shark. The former commercial fisherman, currently a fishing guide for royals in Dubai,  contacted National Geographic News to share the photos. Unlike the two-headed bull shark, the two heads on the blue shark foetus are separated completely in a freak of nature. He told National Geographic News that fishermen often cut open pregnant sharks because they are only allowed to keep 20 blue sharks on a boat at a . time, including foetal ones. He said that normally when they cut open a pregnant blue shark there could be almost a hundred pups in there. He said: 'We toss them in the water . and they usually swim off fine. I cut open quite a few and that was the . only strange one I ever saw.' While there have been only about a half dozen reported cases of two-headed sharks, the condition has been seen in a number of animals, including human beings. It occurs when the embryo does not finish splitting into twins, in the same process which produces conjoined twins. Experts said had the two-headed shark . been born, it would not have survived since it wouldn’t be able to swim . away from predators. It comes after scientists confirmed the discovery of a two-headed bull shark foetus - which at the time was believed to be the world's first ever. It was found in the Gulf of Mexico, by a fisherman when he opened the uterus of an adult shark . MRI scans of the shark revealed two distinct heads, hearts and stomachs. The rest of the body then rejoined to form a single tail . The condition of having more than one head is known as polycephaly, with two-headedness described specifically by the terms bicephaly or dicephaly. But the creatures rarely live beyond a few months. Each head of a polycephalic animal has its own brain, and they share control of the organs and limbs, though the specific structure of the connections varies. Such animals often move in a disoriented and dizzy fashion, with the brains 'arguing' with each other leading some specimens to simply zig-zag without getting anywhere. In snakes, each head may attack and even attempt to swallow the other. He said: 'I didn’t think it was that . special but apparently it is.

The single bullshark - with two heads . - was found in the Gulf of Mexico, according to a study by Michigan . State University and reported in the Journal of Fish Biology. It was discovered by a fisherman when . he opened the uterus of an adult shark in 2011, around a year after the . Deepwater horizon oil spill, in the Gulf of Mexico. While other species of sharks have . been born with two heads - including blue sharks and tope sharks - this . is the first record of it in a bull shark. Bull . sharks are one of only a few species of shark that attacks humans, and . are also popular with fisherman, as they put up a 'good fight'. Michael Wagner, MSU assistant professor of fisheries and wildlife, told the Register: 'They're hardy little critters. 'But . despite this, the two-headed specimen probably would have died after . birth. It was near-to-term, but should have been a lot larger – the body . looks to have invested so much energy in growing a separate head that . the rest of the body was foreshortened.' Most of the two-headed creatures shortly after birth, and in this case the creature died shortly after it was discovered, . Mr Wagner said there were many  more cases of two-headed lizards and snakes, because they are often bred in captivity where breeders can observe and monitor the oddities. After it was discovered, the shark was taken to the marine science department at Florida Keys Community College and then to Michigan State’s campu where Mr Wagner and his team used magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) to study it. They revealed two distinct heads, hearts and stomachs. The rest of the body then rejoined to form a single tail. While the professor noted in his research that some may link the deformed shark to exposure to pollutants, to link it to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill would be 'unwarranted'. He added: 'We simply have no evidence to support that cause or any other.' According to the International Shark . Attack File, there were 80 instances of unprovoked shark attack against . humans in 2012, with seven deaths.","Christopher Johnston found creature in adult shark uterus in Indian Ocean .

A woman who was dragged into . an alleyway and raped after a night out was subjected to a second . horrifying ordeal by another man as she lay recovering from the attack. Mustafa Yussuf was the first to prey . on the woman as she walked through Manchester city centre on New year's Eve, marching her . into Church Street car park and raping her in a nearby lane. After the assault the then 20-year-old fled the scene, leaving the woman helpless. It was then that, instead of assisting her, another man pounced on the woman and raped her. The distressing details of the double rape emerged as Yussuf, now 21, from Manchester, was jailed for seven years for the attack. He claimed to have had a consensual encounter with the woman but denied rape. But a jury at Manchester Crown Court trial rejected his account and found him guilty. Judge Martin Steiger QC, sentencing, . said he ‘hadn’t the slightest doubt’ that Yussuf was ‘perfectly aware’ the woman was too drunk to consent to any activity. The court heard that the ‘mature’ woman had drunk to excess because of relationship problems, with CCTV showing she was unable to stand. She was refused re-entry to the nightclub when she asked to be allowed in to search for her lost handbag. In the aftermath of the double-rape attack she needed strangers’ help to get home and she was unable to remember what had happened to her for two hours. Zoe Nield, defending, said: ‘This offence does appear to be an isolated incident - it was out of character for this defendant.’ The double rape happened in an alleyway near Church Street car park in Manchester city centre, pictured, on New Year's Eve . The victim told court that her life had been shattered by the attack and had been isolated by a fear of going out. Judge Steiger said: ‘At some point in the course of her ordeal she was raped by another individual. ‘There was never any charge laid against this defendant [Yussuf] for being party to that incident, which the complainant found in many ways the most traumatic feature of her ordeal.’ Another man was arrested for the second rape but released without charge.","Mustafa Yussuf, 21, was jailed for seven years for raping the woman on New Year's Eve .

The Obama administration convened a cabinet-level meeting Tuesday afternoon to decide whether U.S. military aid to Egypt will continue, just hours after an aide to a Democratic senator told a reporter the aid had already been placed on a temporary hold. The U.S. is on schedule to provide Egypt, the most populous nation in the Arab world, with about $1.5 billion in various aid packages, a majority of which is in the form of aid to the nation's military. 'POTUS's Situation Room meeting on Egypt started on time, at 2:30pm,' a White House pool reporter wrote at 4:15pm. 'It's unclear whether pool will have [an] end time.' Supply: The U.S. provides Egypt with military equipment as part of a $1.3bn foreign aid program . On Tuesday a staffer in the office of Vermont Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy told The Daily Beast that most military aid and weapons deliveries to Egypt had been halted by the administration, along with civilian economic aid. But the White House quickly denied those reports, saying no decision had been reached. Its afternoon meeting of top brass marks a critical moment in the history of U.S.-Egypt relations. The Obama administration's choice of whether to cancel future military aid will be seen as a sign that the White House is choosing sides in the urban warfare that has claimed the lives of more than 1,000 so far. Islamist protesters are demanding a return to power by former president Mohamed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood. A military coup seized power on July 3. The White House has taken pains to avoid calling it a coup, however, as that designation would have forced the government to cut off aid immediately. The Foreign Assistance Act, which dates back to 1961, declares that funds allocated to foreign countries become an option exercise if the target nation's 'duly elected head of government is deposed by military coup or decree'. Presidents since then have displayed great flexibility in interpreting that language, however, despite the lack of a written exception in the law for national security emergencies. The Obama administration understands that American interests are served by maintaining a working relationship with Egypt's politically powerful armed forces. But in addition to a desire to avoid being the administration that 'lost' Egypt, Obama's senior team wants the administration to seem outraged by the military's attacks on pro-Muslim Brotherhood protesters. Most U.S. aid comes in the form of cash transfers to American military contractors, who then produce and deliver small arms and heavy equipment, including the M1A1 Abrams tank, the F-16 fighter jet and the M16 assault rifle. Aid: Cash transfers are given to military contractors who deliver equipment such as Apache helicopters . Order: Tanks, such as this one pictured guarding Cairo, are also supplied . In addition to those weapons, . American defense contractors provide training and spare parts, requiring . constant contact with military officers in Egypt. It's that contact, . experts say, that allows the U.S. to give the Egyptians a westernized . frame of reference - one that's favorable to the United States. Israel is the only nation to get more U.S. aid than Egypt since the end of the 1940s. Through 2011, the U.S. had committed $71.6bn in military and economic aid to maintaining good U.S-Egyptian relations and peace between Egypt and Israel.The Huffington Post published a list of some of the weapons packs that have been included:125 M1A1 Abrams tanksCost: $1.3 billion in 2011Defense Contractor: General Dynamics; Honeywell; Allison Transmission24 F-16 fighter aircraftCost: $3.2 billion in 2009Defense Contractor: Lockheed MartinSix Frigate WarshipsCost: $210 million in 2010Defense Contractor: VSC Global6,900 anti-armor missilesCost: $319 million in 2008Defense Contractor: Raytheon12 Apache helicoptersCost: $820 million in 2009Defense Contractor: Boeing400 Hellfire missilesCost: $51 million in 2009Defense Contractor: Hellfire Limited6 Chinook helicoptersCost: $308 million in 2009Defense Contractor: Boeing2,000 TOW missilesCost: $99 million in 2007Defense Contractor: Raytheon4 Blackhawk helicoptersCost: $167 million in 2008Defense Contractor: Sikorsky . 'We . want them to be addicted to U.S. military technology because that gives . us leverage,' Middle East expert and national security columnist . Richard Miniter told MailOnline. 'Our . equipment requires lots of ongoing training -- think aircraft avionics . -- whereas the Chinese stuff, for instance, doesn't require as much. Military-to-military contact creates a military culture that's . friendlier to the rule of law and democracy. 'Informal contact between military officers can be more productive, over time, than diplomatic summits.' In addition, the U.S. is delivering aid to Egypt in part to buy preferential access to the Suez Canal and military jet flyover rights. The two countries' relationship dates to 1979, when President Jimmy Carter brought Egypt and Israel together with pledges of peace from both, and economic aid from the U.S.At present, the $1.5 billion in aid to Egypt is the United States' fourth-largest such commitment. Israel gets $3 billion each year; Iraq receives $2.1 billion; and the U.S. sends Pakistan $1.7 billion. If the White House were to decide to forgo the benefits it receives and pull back its aid packages, it's unlikely the Egyptian military would feel any kind of budget pinch. Saudi Arabia promised Monday that it would make up for any shortfall Egypt's military had as a result of western nations canceling their commitments. The Saudis already provide the bulk of a $12 billion annual aid package from wealthy Arab countries. And killing what amounts to a make-work program for favored military contractors - Egypt, according to an August 8 NPR analysis, already has more heavy weaponry than it needs - would cost U.S. jobs. A manager at Lockheed Martin told MailOnline on background that while Egypt's acquisitions of U.S. hardware isn't the difference between any one company's life or death, the total of military aid to foreign countries represents a significant part of their business. 'There are companies that would lay . off 500 to 1,000 people if the government stopped subsidizing all this . equipment to overseas.' Mr Miniter said another reason to be wary of disconnecting with Egypt's military leaders is that recent history shows the U.S. can find itself in a predicament if it tries to intervene later for national security reasons. Unrest: A military checkpoint in Cairo checks vehicles after a curfew was imposed . 'When we disengaged from the Pakistanis in the 1990s, all the military-to-military contact declined,' he recalled. 'But after 9/11 - after just a decade or so - the military leaders there suddenly were Islamists, bearded, different. Working with them became much more challenging. The same thing could happen in Egypt.'","$1.5 billion due to go to Egyptian leaders as part of U.S. aid package .

Warning: Professor J Meirion Thomas, pictured, says the NHS levy is something the Government 'really should not do' Plans to make foreigners pay a £200 NHS surcharge would create the ‘best travel insurance on the planet’, a leading surgeon has warned. Professor J Meirion Thomas said the Government’s move would be a ‘disaster’ and simply attract more ‘health tourists’. The proposals, which affect migrants and foreign students staying in the UK for more than six months, came as the Government estimated that health tourism was costing the NHS up to £2billion a year. Professor Thomas, a cancer specialist, was one of the first whistleblowers to expose the financial impact of non-British residents seeking free healthcare on the NHS. He said: ‘It [the levy] is the worst thing they could do. The biggest disaster that can happen to the solution of health tourism would be to accept this £200 levy for migrants wanting to come to this country and for students.’ He added: ‘If you sell to the visitor what is essentially a travel insurance of £200, the health tourists will go, “Wow, that’s even easier than it was before with all the loopholes; we had to jump a few fences before. '""All we are going to do is pay £200, which is the best travel insurance on the planet and it gives us entitlement to NHS care”. ‘Of all the things that the Government are proposing, that is the one thing they should really not do – allow visitors and students to pay £200 at the border for access to the health service. That would be an absolute disaster.’ Professor Thomas also said the £2billion figure quoted by the Government regarding the cost of health tourism was wildly inaccurate. ‘I don’t accept those figures; they grossly underplay the total cost,’ he said. ‘For example, I know of examples where the bill for individual health tourists has been between £500,000 and £1million. I know of one district general hospital where they get about 15 health tourists a month.’ He pointed to British citizens who have retired in the sun and then return to the UK when they find out they have cancer or another illness. Costly: A report estimated the health tourism costs the NHS up to £2billion a year . Extra strain: According to Professor Thomas, the NHS levy will make coming to the UK for treatment even more attractive . ‘The longest example I have is 48 years, but I have other examples of 20, 30 and 40 years, who then suddenly just walk back into the country with a serious illness. They are impossible to identify.’ For years Professor Thomas has criticised how the three main political parties subscribe to the mantra that the NHS should be ‘free at the point of use’. ‘The consequence of such altruism - all at the UK taxpayer’s expense - is health tourism and abuse of the NHS by ineligible patients. The general public seem unaware of this deception despite being rightly exercised about other examples of similar abuse, such as benefit fraud. How is this any different?’ A report from the Department of Health this week concluded the Health Service had ‘some of the most generous rules in the world’. And it even found evidence of relatives of migrants taking advantage of visits to Britain to have free treatment. The bill was put at between £1.9billion and £2billion – with only about 16 per cent of the money clawed back. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt hopes to recover up to £500million a year, arguing Britain cannot afford an ‘international health service’. The Home Office plans a new annual levy of £150 on foreign students and £200 on temporary migrants. The surcharge is expected to generate £200million. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘The surcharge proposed is very competitive with the level charged by other countries and strikes a careful balance between making a fair contribution and maintaining the UK as an attractive place to visit, study and do business.’","Professor J Meirion Thomas attacked plans for an NHS surcharge .

There, vets discovered 80-100 BBs lodged in the dog's face, back and legs. The one-year-old Labrador, who has since been adopted, miraculously escaped any eye or organ damage and is doing well but Lincoln County Animal Control and the Waldoboro Police Department are trying to track down her attackers. Hunt: The Lincoln County Animal Control Office is looking for the culprits who covered one-year-old black Labrador Lady with pellets from a BB gun . Boothbay Animal Hospital veterinarian Dr Dean Domeyer, who treated Lady, said the BBs appear to be brass and therefore only need to be removed if they start to infect the dog's skin. 'She's a lucky dog,' Peter Blanton, Lady's new owner, told WCVB.com. 'I mean, she doesn't have any eye damage... and she doesn't seem to have any organ damage, so I think she's going to have a wonderful life. She's very lucky. I think I'm very lucky.' Dr Domeyer said he thought something was odd when he felt a bump on Lady's snout after she was first brought to authorities. Riddled: An Xray, pictured, showed some 50 BBs in the animal's head alone . Lucky: There were scores more in Lady's abdomen but she was lucky to get away relatively unharmed . Love: Lady, pictured in an Xray, has since been adopted and is in the care of her new owner . 'It wasn't just another little lump. You could feel something that was hard and round, and it felt like a BB, . so we decided to take an X-ray,' Dr Domeyer told the station. One X-ray revealed 50 BB pellets in the dog's head and another showed there were many more scattered throughout her body. 'There are BBs everywhere. There is one pellet and multiple, multiple BBs,' said Dr Domeyer. Dr Domeyer said the dog appears to be happy and healthy enough but they'll keep monitoring her to ensure she doesn't develop any health concerns at a later date. Wandering: The stray lab was found two weeks ago wandering in Waldoboro, Maine, before she was taken to the Lincoln County Animal Shelter . 'It still remains with Lady whether we are going to have to do anything about these BBs or not,' he said. 'Right now, none of them pose any threat to her. We have also not done any lead levels or blood cell count to make sure there is no issue, and that’s probably on the docket.' Meanwhile, the adorable hound is settling in well with her new owner, who is treating her like the high class character she is. 'In just one day, she follows me like a shadow.

Snowden, 30, who has been inundated with offers from Russian women of a home and marriage, may have already left Sheremetyevo Airport, where he has been living for a month since fleeing Hong Kong after the US called for him to be arrested, several unconfirmed Russian reports said on Tuesday. He is expected to be allowed a temporary Russian visa while his asylum application is formally considered. In Russia, Vladimir Putin has refused to hand him over to America but has also made clear he does not want Snowden to become an issue destabilising relations with Washington. The American wants to make a permanent home in exile in South America but the US has called on countries he would overfly or transit to arrest him and hand him to the US authorities. A spokesman at the Air Express transit hotel said Tuesday: 'He is not here.' His lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said last night: 'As far as I know, Snowden is in Sheremetyevo's transit zone.' Putin has denied his secret services are tapping the former CIA employee for his intelligence knowledge. 'I am receiving calls from people who ask me to convey their offers of help.

Authorities issued mandatory evacuation orders for low-lying areas south of New Orleans on Friday as the weakened Tropical Storm Karen closed in on the Louisiana coast after disrupting U.S. energy output in the Gulf of Mexico. Karen's top winds dropped to 45 mph, down from 65 mph a day earlier, although National Hurricane Center forecasters in Miami said the storm was expected to strengthen slightly on Saturday but remain a tropical storm.

Karen began losing its punch after a busy day of preparations along the Gulf Coast for the storm, a late-arriving worry in what had been a slow hurricane season in the U.S. Karen would be the second named storm to make landfall in the U.S. - the first since Tropical Storm Andrea hit Florida in June. Oil output in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico had been cut in half as oil and gas firms shut platforms and evacuated some workers in preparation for the storm. The Gulf accounts for about 19 per cent of U.S. oil production and six per cent of natural gas output. The mayor of Grand Isle, Louisiana, clamped a mandatory evacuation on the popular vacation and fishing destination on a barrier island south of New Orleans. Evacuations were also ordered in Lafourche Parish in the south, and residents in much of Plaquemines Parish, southeast of New Orleans, were told to be out of their homes before nightfall. Karen's projected path shifted slightly westward and it was expected to move ashore over Louisiana on Saturday night and into Mississippi and then Alabama on Sunday. Alabama joined Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida in declaring a state of emergency. The Federal Emergency Management Agency and Interior Department recalled workers, furloughed because of the government shutdown, to deal with the storm and help state and local agencies. Evacuated: Jonie Harvey carries items as she loads the family cars as her family prepares to leave, due to a mandatory evacuation in advance of Tropical Storm Karen, in Belair, part of Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana on Friday . By late Friday afternoon, the storm was centered about 235 miles south-southwest of the mouth of the Mississippi River. It was moving north-northwest but was forecast to turn to the northeast as it crossed the coast.At the Port of New Orleans, cargo operations continued normally, but the harbor pilots who guide ships through the mouth of the Mississippi had ceased operations. 'No ships are coming in or out the mouth of the river,' said port spokesman Matt Gresham. Forecasters said late Friday that Karen was expected to dump one to three inches of rain on the central Gulf Coast and southeastern United States by Monday night, less than originally predicted, with up to six inches in isolated parts. The storm was expected to dump up to six inches of rain in its path and to push a surge of seawater over the shoreline, the hurricane center said. Batten down: Al Baumer of Madisonville, Louisiana unties his boat to take it out of the water before Tropical Storm Karen arrives at Point Cadet Marina in Biloxi, Mississippi . Ralph Atkins, owner of Southern Fish & Oyster Co on a downtown dock in Mobile, Alabama, said he expected to see a 'good squall' from Karen but nothing he couldn't deal with. 'Our big trouble is water. Water can build up and make it bad,' Atkins said. 'It's just another day in the fish business. Nature just needs to take a bath every now and then,' he added. At Alabama's Grand Mariner Marina on Dog River and Mobile Bay, boaters were tying down the larger vessels with double ropes and putting the smaller ones on trailers to haul them up the river to sheltered coves. 'It's like New York City at lunch time here. We are really busy,' said marina manager Steve Penny. 'We are doing everything we can to make room for four to six feet of water. Anything we can move, we get out.' Calm before the storm: Maintenance crews with Plaquemines Parish lift a heavy gate across an opening where train tracks are located in anticipation of Tropical Storm Karen . Valuables: Tamisha Isidore, 16, carries her shoes to the family car as they prepare to leave, due to a mandatory evacuation in advance of Tropical Storm Karen, in Pointe a la Hache in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana yesterday . Weakening: Tropical Storm Karen is seen in a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) East infrared enhanced satellite image taken at 21:45 EST October 4 . Marina workers were adding fuel to their 8,000-gallon (30,280-liter) tanks to weigh them down and keep them from floating away. A hurricane watch for the coast from Grand Isle, Louisiana, to Destin, Florida was dropped. Tropical storm watches and warnings were still in effect in other areas including metropolitan New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain. Tropical storms carry winds of 39 mph to 73 mph. In Washington, White House spokesman Jay Carney said President Barack Obama was being updated about the storm, which put an undisclosed number of FEMA workers back to work. Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, which oversees offshore drilling, is providing updates on oil and gas drilling in the Gulf that has been shut-in as a result of the storm. The National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service were securing parks and refuges in the storm's path, officials said. The Bureau of Indian Affairs contacted the three federally recognized tribes in the storm's path to coordinate responses and assess needs, and the U.S. Geological Survey is monitoring for flood levels.","Authorities issued evacuation orders for low-lying areas of Louisiana Friday .

'Killer': Michael Chadd Boysen admitted to strangling his grandparents, Norma and Robert Taylor . A mentally unstable man has pleaded guilty to strangling his grandparents after they welcomed him home from prison with a party. Michael Chadd Boysen, 27, was arrested following a manhunt in March for allegedly killing Norma and Robert Taylor at their home in Renton, Washington. Boysen, who has suffered from a range of mental illnesses and has tried to kill himself 12 times since his arrest, on Friday pleaded guilty to aggravated first-degree murder. His plea has been modified so while he has not actually admitted he is guilty, he has agreed he would be convicted if the case were to go to a jury, the Seattle Post Intelligencer reported. He now faces a mandatory sentence of . life without parole at his sentencing later this year. The County . prosecutor opted not to seek the death penalty for the alleged murderer. Boysen . killed his grandfather, 82, and grandmother, 80, just hours after they . threw him a party celebrating his release from state prison on March 8. He had served nine months for a burglary conviction and authorities said . there was nothing particularly alarming about his record . Scene: Their strangled bodies were found in their bedroom the next day and police launched a manhunt . But . family members revealed after the killings that Boysen had made threats . against members of his family and law enforcement officers while he was . behind bars. The Taylors' strangled bodies were found in their bedroom closet the next day by their daughter. Investigators . soon determined that Boysen had killed the couple and then fled in . their car, taking cash and a credit card from their home. He also . allegedly took jewelery he then sold at a pawn shop. As police launched a manhunt, staff at a motel in Lincoln City, Oregon recognized Boysen from a news report and alerted police that he had checked in. Officers swarmed the scene. During the siege, police pointed rifles at the motel, fired blasts from a water cannon and used a bullhorn to try to persuade Boysen to give up. Caught: He was found in a motel and taken into custody after a stand-off with police. He now faces life in prison without the possibility of parole and officials say he has repeatedly tried to kill himself . Officers eventually stormed his room, finding him inside with self-inflicted wounds. He was taken into custody, where he has been deemed mentally ill. No motive has been given for the killings. He . has harmed himself 12 times since his arrest and now spends much of his . time strapped to a bed or a backboard, the Seattle PI reported. According to King County Jail staff, he has harmed himself with a variety of items including an orange seed and has pulled out his stitches.","Michael Chadd Boysen killed Norma and Robert Taylor in March after he finished a nine-month stint in prison for a burglary .

This is the cheeky seal who pops into London city centre every day for a free salmon lunch at Billingsgate Market. For around 10 years the large marine mammal has been fed by the finest fish usually destined for some of the capital's top restaurants. Despite being in the heart of London just yards from Canary Wharf the grey seal has resisted any attempts to release it into the wild. Scroll down for video . Dinner time: Sammy the seal visits Billingsgate Market, Canary Wharf, where he is fed salmon by dockside porters who bang on metal to signify feeding time . Attempts have been made to release Sammy into the wild but the seal keeps returning to be fed at the dock . Instead the seal - dubbed Sammy - seems to prefer the des-res address surrounded by marinas and the city's high-flying financial market in Docklands. Dockside porters at Billingsgate have become so used to Sammy they even 'call him' for dinner by banging at metal bar at the side of the dock. Billingsgate constable Gary Meeks . said: ‘They've tried to release Sammy into the wild in the past but he . just comes back, he's obviously happy here or he wouldn't. ‘Sammy . usually turns up in the morning and the porters bang on the metal bar . at the side of the dock and up he pops out of the water. ‘He's . obviously well fed and he must have been coming here for the last 10 . years, I'm a Londoner and you don't see many seals about to be honest. ‘His favourite fish is salmon, I'm not surprised given the size of some of the ones thrown over the fence to him.’ Sammy's favourite food is salmon and seal experts have said it would be cruel to stop feeding him now . Experts have said the markings on the seal's coat suggest Sammy could be a female . But seal experts have cast doubt on Sammy's credentials - and now believe his markings show he might actually be female. Amy Hudson, from the Cornish Seal Sanctuary, said Sammy may be a Samantha rather than a Samuel due to the markings on the seal's coat. She said: ‘We normally advise people not to feed seals in the wild but as Sammy...has been there so long it would be cruel to stop.’ Sammy has been spotted by workers from the area and market shoppers over the years and one wildlife enthusiast even uploaded footage of the seal online. He is such a regular face around the docks at Billingsgate the he has been included in Zoological Society London's Marine . Mammal Survey since 2008. ZSL’s Marine and Freshwater Conservation Programme Manager, Alison . Debney, said: 'Sightings such as Sammy are very important; they help to . build up a picture of the rivers’ role in the ecology of British marine . mammals. 'We need people to keep an eye out and to detail their sightings . at www.zsl.org – it could help conservationists in the future.' Sammy was first named by Samantha Davenport, who spotted him when working at Canary Wharf's Barclays Bank building. She named Sammy after after a children’s book by Syd Hoff. She told ZSL: 'It was so . exciting the first time I saw the seal, I almost jumped in – it’s a . lovely and quite grounding experience to see such wildlife amongst all . this steel and glass.' Billingsgate became associated . exclusively with the fish trade in the sixteenth century and in 1699 an .

Transatlantic fares from under £150 will be on offer from the UK when a low-cost carrier begins new long-haul services from Gatwick next summer, its Scandinavian boss announced. From the beginning of July 2014, budget carrier Norwegian is to fly from Gatwick to New York, Los Angeles and Fort Lauderdale in Florida. Starting on July 3, the thrice-weekly services to New York will have an introductory one-way fare of £149, while the Los Angeles service, starting on July 2, will be twice a week with an introductory fare of £199 one way. From the beginning of July 2014, budget carrier Norwegian is to fly from Gatwick to New York, Los Angeles and Fort Lauderdale in Florida .

Norwegian also announced it would be starting five new European services from Gatwick next year - Budapest, Cyprus, Sicily, Santorini and Corfu. Norwegian's chief executive Bjorn Kjos (KJOS) said: ‘There's great demand for high-quality flights at a low fare between the UK and the US, particularly to and from Gatwick. ‘We are looking forward to welcoming many new customers on board our brand new aircraft.' Gatwick chief executive Stewart Wingate said: ‘This is one of the most exciting route developments since Gatwick's change of ownership four years ago. ‘It shows the benefits to passengers of Gatwick competing with . Heathrow on routes, price and service. 'Norwegian’s decision to . re-establish London Gatwick's links to strategic destinations in North . America.

In 2009, its number of weekly flights from the airport stood at 198, but by the end of this summer, that figure will have been boosted to 320. In January 2012, it announced Europe’s largest ever mass aircraft purchase, ordering 122 Boeing 737 aircraft as part of a significant expansion. Norwegian currently offers 320 weekly flights and 25 routes from London Gatwick. It means the budget airline is taking on . established rivals such as British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and big US . carriers in a new transatlantic price war. Norwegian said it is also adding  more frequencies to existing destinations Malaga, Ibiza, Split, Dubrovnik, Majorca, Faro, Tenerife, Copenhagen and Barcelona. The U.S. flights will be on the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane (interior pictured) Norwegian’s boss Mr Kjos added: ‘Launching long-haul routes between London Gatwick and the United States is also an important part of our strategy to expand internationally and get a stronger foothold in markets outside Scandinavia.’ Last month Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary announced he is planning ‘ten buck’ transatlantic flights to the United States. The ebullient budget airline chief executive said he wanted tickets to start from as little as US$10  – or around £6.30 at current exchange  rates – to bust open the strangle-hold of the major airlines  including rivals British Airways.

A former paratrooper who was jailed for butchering two migrant workers but escaped after he dug a 30-metre long tunnel has been caught after four months on the run. Vladimir Avdeyev, 38, was jailed for 25 years in 2006 for brutally killing two migrant workers and badly disfiguring four others in a gruesome attack near to Irkutsk, Siberia. In May, Avdeyev escaped a high security . jail near Markovo, north of Irkutsk, by digging a 30-meter long tunnel under the facility with two other murderers and a robber. Residents of the city were warned to stay in their homes after the violent man escaped. At the time, a former comrade of his said: 'He can kill any number of people with his bare hands - and will not be taken alive,' the Siberian Times had reported. A prosecutor warned on local news site vsp.ru that he could 'hold out in the taiga for a month with a knife and a . single match'. The criminal says he lived in the dense Taiga forest near to the prison for four months, foraging for food in the wilderness. Avdeyev - nicknamed the Rambo of Taiga by Russian media - says he had . not seen another person during his entire time on the run. However, some reports have suggested that foresters may have told police of his whereabouts after he . worked for them as a lumberjack. He did not offer any resistance when captured, the Irkutsk Region branch of the Federal Prison Service said on its website. On hearing he had been found, one of Avdeyev's relatives is reported to have said: 'It is strange that he surrendered alive.' Avdeyev's three accomplices were caught by the authorities earlier. A police probe was launched following the escape but the results are yet to be published. The criminal will now serve an additional five years on top of his sentence for double murder.

The new model has a more powerful processor and an improved resolution which is considerably better quality than its mini-tablet rival - the iPad mini. 'However, the new Nexus 7’s Achilles heel - as with all Android tablets - is the quality of the apps available compared to the iPad mini and other Apple tablets. 'The relatively slim volume of Android apps optimised for tablets is also a problem, meaning that even if they work, they often have limited functionality.'

Like many other dogs, Boomer loves nothing more than roaming his neighborhood, barking at passing cars and fellow canines before returning home for a bowl of biscuits and a nap in his kennel. The only difference is that Boomer was born a human. Gary Matthews, 47, has been living the life of a playful pooch for years - donning a white-and-grey costume made from paper with an over-sized collar proudly displaying his new name. This summer, Boomer welcomed National Geographic's Taboo USA to his home in Pittsburgh to look at his life as a 'furry' - people interested in animals with human personalities or characteristics. Scroll down for video . Living ruff: Gary Matthews, pictured left and right, believes he is a dog and goes by the name of Boomer. When he is not wearing his homemade dog costume, left, he ties his hair into 'ears' and wears a collar, right . Matthews adopted the persona after watching the NBC hit show 'Here's . Boomer', which is about a stray dog who travels the world to help people, when he was a child. In an interview with Vice three years ago, he described having a 'transformation' in 1979 after he headed inside after a hot day and laid on the basement floor to cool down. 'I had this waking dream of actually transforming into a dog,' he explained. 'It felt like I was stuck in the floor because I was really into the whole emotion of changing into a dog. 'And I laid there for like 15 minutes, thinking about how I would break it to my parents about how I had transformed. It was like, wow, that was a turning point moment for me.' Watch video from WPXI: . Proud: Boomer dons his paper suit and walks around the community, where people call him by his dog name . Dinner time: A video on YouTube shows Boomer eating dog food from a bowl on the floor . He now eats dog food, slurps water from bowls on the floor and sleeps in an indoor doghouse fitted with a bed - which he insists is much more comfortable than a human bed. He doesn't wear his full costume at all times; when he wakes up in the morning, he ties his long hair into two bunches atop his head - for 'ears' - and wears a smaller collar around his neck. And when he leaves the house, he carries a squeaky toy under his arm. In 2010, he tried to legally change his name to Boomer the Dog but a judge refused, claiming that the change could 'put the public welfare at risk'. Ronald W. Folino, an Allegheny County judge, said it could cause 'confusion in the marketplace' and that it could prove problematic if Matthews was required as a witness to a crime. 'Consider the following example,' Judge Folino wrote, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. A dog's life: Boomer stands outside his house in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he lives alone . Inspired: He explained that he loved the TV show 'Here's Boomer' and felt his transformation to a dog in the 70s . 'Petitioner witnesses a serious automobile accident and telephones for an emergency medical response. The dispatcher on the phone queries as to the caller's identity, and the caller responds, ""This is Boomer the Dog"". It is not a stretch to imagine the telephone dispatcher concluding that the call is a prank and refusing to send an emergency medical response.' Boomer, who is an unemployed IT . technician, explained that his friends, family and neighbors still call . him by his dog name - which he puts down to being open about his dog . persona since childhood. He told Vice that he has had a lot more positive responses than negatives ones, but he has yet to meet a 'puppy girl' who shares his obsession. National Geographic explains there are other people like Boomer living as furries, a subculture that was first recognized . in the United States in the 1980s. Furries celebrate anthropomorphic animals with human characteristics including high . intelligence, the ability to speak and walk on two legs, among others.","Gary Matthews, 47, has believed he is a dog since childhood .

What was she thinking: Investigations are underway to see what caused Miriam Carey, 34, to go on her dangerous drive . The sisters of the woman who was shot to death by police officers after ramming her car into a White House barricade have spoken out about how she was a 'vibrant woman and had a lot of dreams and aspirations'. Miriam Carey, 34, was killed on Thursday after she slammed into a Capitol Hill barricade following a police chase and it was only after the officers approached the vehicle did they realize she had her young daughter in the backseat. 'She was fun, she was loving. She was filled with dreams for her new daughter,' Miriam's sister Amy Carey-Jones said during an exclusive interview with CNN. 'We don't know what happened. 'We're still trying to put the pieces together. It's very sudden. It still doesn't seem real. We're still waiting for the real story.' The investigation into the use of . force by the Capitol police and the metropolitan police during the . shooting is underway, and the sisters say that may prove one area where . they can get some closure on their unanswered questions. 'Was there some other way that she could have been helped so that it didn’t end tragically?' the woman's sister Amy Carey-Jones asked. 'Personally, I feel that as professionals there has to be another way other than shooting and killing an individual.' Since the shooting, police have revealed that Miriam suffered from post-partum depression following the birth of her now-18-month-old daughter, whose name has not been released. Speaking out: Miriam Carey's sisters- Valerie Carey (left) and Amy Carey-Jones- held a press conference near Amy's home in Brooklyn on Friday . Searching for answers: The sisters have said that they are awaiting the results of the investigation into the use of deadly force, saying that there should have been another way to stop Miriam during her car chase . Heartbreaking: Amy said that they spoke regularly and she knew that Miriam had been working closely with her doctors about tapering off the medication the prescribed for her post-partum depression . Her sisters have spoken out about the . wide-ranging claims about Miriam's mental state, saying that while she . had mental issues in the past, they were under the belief that it was . under control. ‘I didn’t . know she was in DC. I was on my way to work- the call was very sudden,’ Amy said, telling Anderson Cooper how her first reaction was ‘“That . could not have been my sister.”’ 'I immediately went to the television to see what was being reported… I did recognize the car. It just didn’t seem real.' After searching Miriam's Stamford, . Connecticut home, police found files confirming her former mental . diagnosis, though the clearest reports come from the interview with the . victim's sisters. The people who knew; Miriam's sister Amy Carey-Jones spoke to Anderson Cooper about the doctor's decision to taper her off medication he had prescribed for post-partum depression . Surrounded: Police officers surround the car with their weapons drawn after the female driver rammed a barricade close to the White House on Thursday . Luxury Car: Police swarm around the Nissan Infiniti car on grass near the U.S. Capitol October 3, 2013 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC . 'My . sister was not a bipolar schizophrenic individual. I can’t say as to why . she was in DC. Regardless as to why, she was in dc her life should not . have ended there,' Valery Carey, one of Miriam's sisters, told CNN. Amy . described the medical issues as something that was carefully monitored . by her doctors, who felt that she only needed to be on the medication . for a year following the initial diagnosis given her lack of any prior . issues. 'I just know that my sister did experience post-partum depression along with psychosis,' Amy said. 'She worked very closely with her doctor to taper her off the medication. 'It wasn’t something that was displayed- it was a momentary breakdown… She didn’t appear to be unstable. Questions: Sisters Valerie (left) and Amy (right) said that there is no clear reason why Miriam drove down to DC where she met her death on Thursday . Investigation: A federal agent removes evidence from the apartment complex where Miriam Carey is believed to have lived in Stamford, Connecticut, this morning . 'There (were) not moments of her walking around with delusions- that's not what was going on. 'She . had her challenges as a new parent and I always spoke closely with . her,’ Amy said, describing those challenges as ‘nothing out of the . ordinary’. 'She seemed to be overwhelmed.' The . biggest question- why she did it- will be one that remains with family . members for the rest of their lives as Valerie Carey said that 'she was a . law-abiding citizen. She had no political agenda'. 'We will never know what Miriam was thinking in those last hours before she died. We can only speculate,' her sister Amy said. Miriam's boyfriend has told investigators that she feared her house was under surveillance by President Obama, though her sisters dispute that theory. 'What I can say is she has never disclosed of anything of that nature and since my sister is not here to speak for herself, that statement in itself is very questionable,' Valerie told Anderson Cooper during the Friday interview.","Miriam Carey, 34, was killed by police on Thursday when she drove into a barricade near the Capitol and the White House .

A Montana newlywed accused of pushing her husband off a cliff to his death in Glacier National Park pleaded not guilty Friday to murder charges. Jordan Linn Graham, 22, appeared in U.S. District Court in Missoula to face charges of first-degree murder, second-degree murder and making a false statement about the July death of husband Cody Lee Johnson. The accused murderer made no comments as she entered the courthouse serenaded with questions from a large crowd of reporters eagerly awaiting her arrival. Michael Donahoe, Ms Graham's attorney,  entered not guilty pleas on her behalf. Her day in court: Jordan Linn Graham, 22, pleaded not guilty Friday to murdering husband Cody Lee Johnson this past July . The Kalispell woman has insisted from the very beginning that her husband's death was an accident. Their tragic story has garnered national media attention almost from the very beginning, with Ms Graham even pleading her case on magazine covers. Married only eight days when Mr Johnson, 25, disappeared July 7, Ms Graham first told investigators that Johnson's 'buddies from Washington probably came and got him,' according to the indictment. Investigators have accused the widowed woman of pushing her husband off a cliff down onto a viewing area known as the Loop during a July 7 argument after having second thoughts about the marriage. Reported missing July 8 when he did not show up at work, Authorities were unable to find Mr Johnson's body until July 11 when Ms Graham told officials she found it in the hard to reach spot after she thought to look there. Second thoughts: Ms Graham told a friend the morning of the day her husband went missing that she was doubting the viability of the ill-fated marriage . Ms Johnson cryptically told investigators 'it was a place he wanted to see before he died.' As time wore on, and investigators began piecing together their case against Ms Graham, her story began to change. Having first told authorities that her dead husband drove off in a dark car the night he disappeared, Ms Graham admitted July 16 they had an argument at the park the night he died. Ms Graham told investigators she and Mr Johnson . argued on the trail. When he grabbed her . arm as she turned to walk away, she pushed him with both hands in . the back, causing him to fall head-first from a steep cliff, according to an . affidavit. Still free: Jordan Linn Graham, center, leaves the federal courthouse after pleading not guilty to three charges stemming from the death of her husband . Doomed: Ms Graham's second thought about her marriage to Mr Johnson saw the union tragically end only eight days after they were married . Earlier that day, Ms Graham told a friend she was having second thoughts about getting married and meant to talk to Johnson about it, according to the affidavit. She said if the friend didn't hear from her again that night, 'something happened.' Two people who knew the couple told local Montana newspaper that they had their doubts about the wedding. 'We . all had our reservations about their relationship,' Levi Blasdel told . the Daily Inter Lake. 'She seemed so remote from the relationship, so . withdrawn.' That emotional distance carried over to her husband's funeral. 'At the funeral, a number of us had spoken, and while I gave my memorial for Cody at the podium, she was messing around on her phone,' said Mr Blasdel. 'It was very hard for all of us to be there crying and mourning the loss of our friend and she was so unresponsive to that, really no emotion, no crying, very sober,' he added. Not a care in the world: Those who knew her said Ms Graham carried on with her life like nothing happened in the days after her husband's death . Her behavior stood in stark contrast to the crying woman seen before she walked down the aisle at her wedding, Mr Blasdel explained. Despite Ms Graham's unusual reaction to the death of her husband, no one suspected her in the death. It was not until she kept trying to explain the circumstances surrounding his disappearance that doubt began to creep in. 'I don’t think anyone suspected her directly until all of us heard different stories from her,” Lytaunie Blasdel told the Daily Inter Lake. 'That’s when it got weird.' Another friend told authorities that Ms Graham confided during a church service that her husband had died after falling off a cliff - this conversation is said in the affidavit to have happened the day before she 'found' his body at the base of the cliff. Ms Graham had appeared in court last month on a second-degree murder charge and was released after the judge deemed her not to be a flight risk. She is currently in the custody of her parents. If convicted of first-degree murder, Ms Graham faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison. She is due back in court Oct. 15.","Jordan Linn Graham and Cody Lee Johnson were married only eight days when he disappeared .

Thousands of cancer patients will lose out when the Government's special drugs fund for England is wound up next year . Thousands of cancer patients will lose out when the Government’s special drugs fund for England is wound up next year, claim campaigners and leading doctors. Access to cancer medicines will revert to being the worst in Europe, with more than 16,000 patients a year denied help, they say. Cancer charities are calling for the Government to pledge it will not go back to the days when patients ‘had to beg’ for life-prolonging drugs on the NHS. It comes as a new survey shows four out of five people believe Britons should get cancer drugs widely available in other countries but not here. Almost three-quarters of people surveyed said the NHS should pay for people to get the drugs they need, including the terminally ill. The £200million a year Cancer Drugs Fund which began in April 2011 has led to 30,000 patients in England getting drugs banned on the NHS by Nice, the rationing body. The Government's aim, which was a Tory election pledge, was to enable NHS doctors to prescribe any drug if they believed a cancer patient could benefit. But it was a temporary stopgap for three years, until the introduction of a new method of assessment for drug pricing in January. Top cancer charities and specialists say the new system will not cover existing drugs that have become a lifeline for patients. Mark Flannagan, Chief Executive of Beating Bowel Cancer, said: ‘The Government gave a pledge that if your doctor thinks that you should have a cancer drug that will help you to live a longer and better life you should get that drug. ‘The Cancer Drugs Fund has given better access to vital medicines and improved outcomes for thousands of patients. ‘With it due to end, we fear that patients’ lives will be put at risk.  We simply can’t go backwards to a time when cancer patients had to beg for life-extending treatment.’ A survey of 2,000 adults found 80 per cent said the NHS should offer treatments at least as good as other countries. Cancer charities are calling for the Government to pledge it will not go back to the days when patients 'had to beg' for life-prolonging drugs on the NHS . Half believe the NHS should be a world leader in treatments available to patients and pay for them all, with a further 40 per cent saying the NHS should ensure patients in the UK are not worse off than other countries. The survey was commissioned by drug companies Novartis, Roche and Sanofi. Annwen Jones, chief executive of Target Ovarian Cancer, said the charity does not directly or indirectly receive funding from any of the companies involved, but called for the future of the fund to be urgently clarified and extended. Access to cancer medicines will revert to being the worst in Europe, with more than 16,000 patients a year denied help . She said: ‘Without the Cancer Drugs Fund, hundreds of women with ovarian cancer now, and thousands of women with ovarian cancer in the future, will not be able to access vital treatments. ‘Women with ovarian cancer already have extremely limited treatment options, with no new treatments developed in over 20 years. To lose access to drugs like Avastin, the most significant development in a generation, will be disastrous.’ The survey also showed that cancer is people’s top health concern, with two thirds saying it was the disease they feared most. Dementia was the second most-worrying condition for 16 per cent of people. Almost two thirds of cancer treatments considered by Nice (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) are rejected. It is estimated that ending the Cancer Drugs Fund will deny more than 16,000 patients annually from getting potentially life extending drugs. Dr Rob Glynne-Jones, consultant clinical oncologist and Macmillan lead clinician in gastro-intestinal cancer, at the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre said: ‘Cancer is a complex and devastating disease. ‘In the past patients and the public were anxious they wouldn't have access to treatment, but the Cancer Drugs Fund has made it possible for patients to receive the best possible treatments for their cancer - and I can do the job I trained for.  We simply cannot afford to turn the clock back now.’","16,000 patients will be denied drugs when the fund is wound up .

Teenagers who play violent video games over a number of years become more aggressive towards other people as a result, according to a new long-term study. Researchers said the study was the first to show a clear link between a sustained period of playing violent games and subsequent increases in hostile behaviour. Girls who play violent computer games during their school years were found to be affected just as much as boys. Study findings: Those who play violent games over a long period may become more likely to react aggressively to unintentional provocations (file picture) The research team at Brock University . in Canada said their results were 'concerning' and wrote that violent . games could 'reinforce the notion that aggression is an effective and . appropriate way to deal with conflict and anger'. Evidence suggests that long-term . players of violent games may become more likely to react aggressively to . unintentional provocations such as someone accidentally bumping into . them, they added. The findings come after a coroner . urged parents to stop children using adult video games following the . death of Callum Green, 14, from Stockport, who hanged himself after . playing the Certificate 18 game Call of Duty, which features gruesomely . realistic scenes of soldiers trying to kill each other. Anders Breivik, the Norwegian who . killed 77 people, claimed earlier this year that he had played Call of . Duty to train himself for his 'bloody and horrendous' operation. The study, published in the journal . Developmental Psychology, involved 1,492 adolescents at eight high . schools in Ontario, 51 per cent of whom were female and 49 per cent . male. Surveys were carried out annually . across four school years with the participants aged 14 or 15 at the . start of the study and 17 or 18 at its conclusion. Influenced? Anders Breivik, the Norwegian who killed 77 people, claimed earlier this year that he had played video game Call of Duty to train himself . The teenagers were asked a series of . questions such as how often they pushed or shoved people and whether . they they frequently kick or punch people who make them angry. Psychologists used this to give each individual a score for their . aggression level at each point in time. 'This is an important and concerning finding, particularly in light of the hours that youth spend playing these games' Professor Teena Willoughby, lead researcher . They were also asked whether they . played action or fighting video games. In the final two years of the . study they were also asked how frequently they played such games, . ranging from never to for five or more hours per day. Analysis showed that teenagers who . played violent video games over a number of years saw steeper rises in . their aggression scores during the study. Others who regularly played non-violent games did not show any evidence of increased aggression. The trend remained even after taking . into account other variables that could be linked to aggression such as . gender, parental divorce and marijuana use. In reverse: The Canadian study found no evidence that aggressive teenagers were simply more likely to play violent games (file picture) Importantly, the study found no . evidence that teens who were more aggressive to begin with were simply . more likely to play violent games. Pupils with high aggression scores in . Grade 10 were not more likely to play violent games in Grade 11. But . those who played violent games regularly in Grade 11 were rated as more . aggressive the next year. 'The study as a whole does provide one of the strongest pieces of empirical evidence to date that there is a direct relationship between playing violent video games and subsequent aggressive behaviour' Professor Mark Griffiths, British video-game specialist . Lead researcher Professor Teena . Willoughby said: 'The current study is the first to demonstrate a . relation between sustained violent video game play and the progression . of aggressive behaviour. 'It is clear that there is a long-term . association between violent video games and aggression. This is an . important and concerning finding, particularly in light of the hours . that youth spend playing these games.' Professor Mark Griffiths, director of . the International Gaming Research Unit at Nottingham Trent University, . said: 'The study as a whole does provide one of the strongest pieces of . empirical evidence to date that there is a direct relationship between . playing violent video games and subsequent aggressive behaviour.'

Teenage boys should also be given the HPV vaccine to prevent cancers, a leading health expert has said. Michael Douglas (pictured) has spoken out about the link between the viruses and throat cancer . Teenage boys should also be given the HPV vaccine, a leading health expert has said. Professor John Ashton, President of the Faculty of Public Health, says vaccination should not be restricted to teenage girls. He believes that giving boys the injection would be a good way to reduce the number of people suffering from cancers caused by oral sex. Professor Ashton said: ‘We need to talk more about the risks of oral sex and educate people about them. ‘The actor Michael Douglas’ recent comments have helped raise awareness of the links between certain types of HPV and cancer. ‘The biggest risks for cancer are, of course, smoking and drinking. But many people, particularly teenagers, don’t realise the risks of unprotected oral sex.’ He added: ‘It’s important we give our children and young people all the information they need so that they fully understand what safe sex is and how to protect themselves by using condoms and dental dams. ‘That’s why it makes sense to give teenage boys as well as girls the HPV vaccine, which is already happening in Australia. ‘We need to protect everyone from the risks of HPV, particularly men who have sex with men.’ Currently, in the UK the vaccine is offered to all girls aged 12 and 13. Also supporting the call is the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH), the lead professional representative body for those managing sexually transmitted diseases and HIV in the UK. BASHH President, Dr Janet Wilson said: ‘With increasing HPV-related cancer risks from oral sex, we clearly need to raise awareness and promote safer sex among young people and high-risk groups, such as men who have sex with men. ‘However, more urgently, we need to take action to address the lack of protection men who have sex with men receive from the current all-girls HPV vaccination programme. ‘There is now widespread agreement, including within Government, that it is unfair that they remain unprotected.’ Professor John Ashton, President of the Faculty of Public Health, says giving boys the vaccine would be a good way to reduce the number of people suffering from cancers caused by oral sex. Picture shows Michael Douglas with his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones from whom he has recently separated . She added: ‘We are pleased that the . Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisation is looking in to the . possibility of widening the HPV vaccination programme to look . specifically at men who have sex with men. ‘However, it is now ten months since the consultation closed and we still await their response. HPV, also called human papillomavirus, is a group of more than 150 viruses. More than 40 of these viruses can be spread through skin-to-skin contact during sex and oral sex. More than half of sexually active people are infected with one or more HPV at some point in their life. Low-risk HPVs do not cause cancer but can cause warts. However, some high-risk HPVs can cause cancer. High-risk HPV infection is responsible for about five per cent of all cancers. Persistent infection with high-risk HPVs can cause lesions that if untreated, may develop into cancer. Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV infections. HPV also causes anal, vaginal and penile cancer. Recently, the virus has also been linked to throat cancer. ‘We hope that the committee report back at the earliest possible opportunity and that the Government acts swiftly on all recommendations they make. ‘The serious and increasing rates of HPV-related cancers specifically among men who have sex with men mean that we simply cannot afford to delay.’ HPV, also called human papillomavirus, is a group of more than 150 viruses.

Taking paracetamol before a workout can stop you overheating, a study indicates. Researchers found the drug helps cyclists exercise for longer in hot conditions by reducing the impact of heat exertion. It was already known that paracetamol swallowed before exercise can lift performance through a reduction in perceived pain. Work out pills: Paracetemol helped the test subjects perform better . The latest study shows the positive effect in hot conditions. Researchers at the University of Kent said the drug appears to reduce the body’s temperature during exercise, which subsequently improves tolerance to stifling heat. The study involved 11 young recreational exercisers, all male, who were given three exercise challenges. They consumed single doses of paracetamol, or a placebo, before cycling at a fixed intensity for as long as they could in temperatures of 18C and 30C. During the exercise, measures of core and skin temperature were recorded, alongside the participants’ perception of the heat. The results showed the drug allowed them to cycle significantly longer at 30C – by an average of four minutes. Men had a significantly lower core, skin and body temperature and found the exercise produced less heat strain. Tested: The study was carried out on 11 cyclists, who were given three challenges to complete . Dr . Lex Mauger, who led the study at The University of Kent’s School of . Sport and Exercise Sciences, said the study raised questions that needed . to be settled by sports bodies, including ‘rescue remedies’ for people . undertaking exercise in hot climates. He said ‘Firstly, consideration . by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and local anti-doping . authorities should be made about the use of non-steroidal . anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in sport - on both health and . performance grounds. ‘Secondly, the utility of paracetamol as a . first-response drug to exertional heat illness should be investigated.’ The same research team have previously shown that paracetamol can . improve endurance performance through a reduction in exercise-induced . pain. Dr Mauger said ‘Whilst we have found that paracetamol improves . the time someone can exercise in the heat, and that this occurs . alongside a reduced body temperature, we did not measure the specific . mechanisms by which this may have occurred. ‘It is important now to . try and isolate how paracetamol reduced participants’ body temperature . during exercise.’ In a 2008 study, researchers at the University of . Bedfordshire gave paracetamol to 10 cyclists before they completed a . simulated 10-mile time trial. On average, they completed this time . trial 30 seconds faster after taking the drug than when they performed . the same test after taking a placebo. The cyclists’ ratings of . perceived exertion were the same on both occasions, which led to the . conclusion that paracetamol was improving performance capacity by . reducing pain.

Energy bills have almost  doubled since 2000, turning up the heat on Britain’s already hard-pressed families. Households last year spent an  average of £1,339 on gas and electricity – 85 per cent more than the £710 at the turn of the century, research shows. The figures – adjusted to 2012 prices to take inflation into account – show that gas bills went up by 119 per cent and electricity bills by 47 per cent between 2000 and last year. British Gas are the worst offenders, with prices 8 per cent higher on average than their newer rivals . Utility firms have been accused of raking in massive profits as customers struggle to make ends meet. In the past two years alone, gas bills surged by 19 per cent and electricity by 11 per cent. The worst offenders are British Gas and the former regional electricity monopolies, according to the study by the House of Commons Library. More than 20 years after privatisation, they are still charging far more than their rivals, it says. British Gas charges 8 per cent more for gas than the average bill from their newer rivals, researchers said. The figures came as it emerged the firm was planning another price rise before winter. High energy prices are particularly devastating for older people, who often live off modest pensions. In recent years, hypothermia cases have been on the rise as the worst-off are forced to choose between heating or eating. In recent years hypothermia cases have risen as older people on fixed pensions struggle to cope with the surge in prices . Experts warn that prices could rise further in coming years thanks to the Coalition’s green policies. Last year ministers admitted electricity prices were 15 per cent higher than they should be, thanks to Government charges to fund renewable energy projects. Tom Lyon, of the moneysaving website uSwitch.com, said last night: ‘It’s vital that everyone shops around to find the best deal. ‘With £231 between the cheapest and the most expensive deals,  consumers have the power to cut their bills in time for winter and make sure they aren’t paying more than they should be. ‘Unfortunately, consumer apathy and loyalty end up costing them, but benefiting suppliers. Consumers must vote with their feet.’ British Gas is preparing to introduce an inflation-busting price rise just before winter. The increase could come next month even though the company pledged earlier this year to use a profits windfall from the cold weather to keep a lid on tariffs. British Gas, which supplies 12million homes, is planning an increase that could add £100 a year to family energy bills. The average dual fuel bill will rise from £1,232 to more than £1,300 if, as expected, the company brings in an increase of 8 per cent – almost four times the level of inflation. It is understood that British Gas has begun preparing to print flyers to send to customers warning of the increase. Last December the firm increased prices by 6 per cent, and benefited after gas use soared by 18 per cent during the bitterly cold winter. In May, parent company Centrica, run by chief executive Sam Laidlaw, pledged to use its increased profits ‘to effectively hold prices for as long as possible’. Critics branded the planned price rise a ‘slap in the face for consumers’. All the prices in the Commons research have been converted to 2012 prices so they can be compared without being skewed by inflation. It shows that in 2000, the average domestic gas bill was £383, when adjusted to 2012 prices, more than doubling to £839 in 2012. It was a similar story for electricity bills, which were £341 in 2000, soaring by a half to £500 in 2012. Caroline Flint, Labour’s energy spokesman, said: ‘The Government must get behind Labour’s plans to break the dominance of the energy giants, protect the public from being ripped off and create a tough watchdog with the power to force companies to cut prices when costs fall.’ British Gas queried the report, saying it was based on figures from the energy watchdog Ofgem that do not take into account its customers’ lower-than-average energy usage. A spokesman added: ‘Our customers’ energy consumption is much lower than that of the  average energy customer due to the steps we’ve taken to make our customers’ homes more energy efficient and help them manage their energy usage.’ A spokesman for Energy UK, which represents energy providers, said: ‘Britain’s energy prices are relatively low compared to most European countries. ‘Companies try and cushion price rises for customers, but becoming more reliant on imported gas has meant prices have become increasingly influenced by global events.’ The Department for Energy and Climate Change said the forthcoming Energy Bill would help customers, adding: ‘The Bill will ensure that all consumers are on the cheapest tariff to suit their needs. ‘This means getting people off poor-value tariffs, cutting the number of tariffs and giving consumers clear personalised information on their bills so they can compare and switch.’","Homeowners spent an average of £1,339 on energy last year .

They also warned of a ‘chasm of inequality’ between youngsters from the richer south and poorer north. A study of 133,000 children by Public Health England (PHE) showed 27 per cent of children aged five have tooth decay, with on average between three and four teeth affected by decay. More than a quarter of five-year-olds in England have tooth decay, experts have said. Affected children have an average of between three and four decayed teeth . Children in the north and in poor areas have significantly worse oral health, the report found. The British Dental Association said the variations showed a ‘chasm of inequality’ in the oral health of youngsters. However, four-year trends show overall improvements in decay and its severity in young children, PHE said. Overall tooth decay in five-year-olds has reduced from 30.9 per cent to 27.9 per cent and the proportion of children with untreated decay has reduced from 27.5 per cent to 24.5 per cent. Some 72.1 per cent of five-year-olds are free from tooth decay, up from 69.1 per cent in 2008. But levels of decay vary regionally, with more children in northern regions with tooth decay than in the south and eastern regions. There is a 'chasm of inequality' between youngsters from the richer south and poorer north . Levels of decay ranged from 21.2 per cent of five-year-olds in the South East to 34.8 per cent in the North West. Health Minister Lord Howe said: ‘We know more work is needed to make sure good oral health is more consistent right across the country. ‘Every child should have the opportunity to grow up with a healthy smile. ‘However, we have some of the lowest decay rates in the world and more than 70 per cent of children in England are completely free of tooth decay.’ Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said: ‘This latest survey shows the numbers of five-year-olds free from tooth decay has improved but there is still much to do, dental decay is preventable. ‘Parents should brush their children’s teeth for at least two minutes twice a day, once just before bedtime and at least one other time during the day. ‘Also supervise tooth brushing until your child is seven or eight-years-old, either by brushing their teeth yourself or, if they brush their own teeth, by watching how they do it.’ Dr Christopher Allen, the Chair of the British Dental Association’s Dental Public Health Committee, said: ‘This report highlights a welcome improvement to the overall oral health of five-year-old children across England, but it also reminds us of the deep chasm that exists between those with the best and worst oral health. ‘That divide is based not just on geography, but also on deprivation. ‘The fight to close this divide must continue. Crucial to its success are ensuring that a full dental public health workforce is available to advise on initiatives and funding made available to implement preventive programmes that can make a difference, and that children have access to dental care in all parts of the country.’","There is a 'chasm of inequality' between children in the north and the south .

Residents of a Syrian town besieged by President Bashar al-Assad's forces appealed to the world to 'save us from death' in an open letter describing desperate conditions and suffering. Hundreds of men, women and children in Mouadamiya had died and thousands had been wounded, they said. Mouadamiya, on the southwest outskirts of the capital Damascus, was occupied by anti-Assad rebels last year and the government has been trying to win it back since then. 'Save us from death': The residents of Mouadamiya begged the world for help as the country remains in turmoil. Pictured is people trying to extinguish a fire that ignited at a local fuel station in the Bustan al-Qasr neighbourhood of Syria's northern city, Aleppo, yesterday. 'For nearly one year, the city of Mouadamiya has been under siege with no access to food, electricity, medicine, communications, and fuel,' said the letter, distributed by the opposition Syrian National Council today. 'We have been hit by rockets, artillery shells, napalm, white phosphorous, and chemical weapons,' it said. The writers, who did not give their names, said they had managed to find enough power to run a computer and connect to the internet to send the letter. The SNC said nearly 12,000 people face starvation and death in Mouadamiya. About 90 percent of Mouadamiya has been destroyed, few doctors remained, and residents were eating 'leaves of trees. Civil war: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad (speaking here during an interview with Russian State broadcaster Rossia 24) More than 100,000 people have died during the war, which started with peaceful protests against four decades of Assad family rule in March 2011 . It has not been possible to confirm reports from the besieged town due to government restrictions. The government says the residents of Mouadamiya are being 'held hostage' by terrorists, the term it uses for armed opposition groups. It denies using chemical weapons. United Nations humanitarian chief Valerie Amos said last week that despite the government evacuating 3,000 people this month, thousands more remain trapped inside Mouadamiya. She said that United Nations teams had been denied access. Local doctors say hunger has become severe in recent months.

Save us from the hell of Assad's killing machine.' More than 100,000 people have died during the war, which started with peaceful protests against four decades of Assad family rule in March 2011 then escalated into a civil war with sectarian overtones.

But the caption on the website read 'Fridge Raider' instead. 'That picture was taken late in the evening,' she explains. 'I was red-faced from the heat, my makeup was sweating off and I was lacking proper boob support.' While to her, the photo showed how much fun she was having at the time, commenters - most of them women - took a different view, cruelly remarking on her appearance. Some of the critics wrote that she was a 'waste of space,' while others suggested she should die to 'spare everyone's eyes.' Despite her sadness and shock at the comments, Ms Seida admits she understood why these internet users sunk so low. 'No one thought about the possibility that I might read those words. Far less that I would talk' 'Of course, they hadn't really thought . of me as a person. Why should they? These images are throwaways, little . bursts of amusement to get through a long workday. 'No one thought about the possibility that I might read those words,' she writes. 'Far less, that I would talk.' And . talk she did. Instead of wallowing in self-pity, Ms Seida decided to . take action by retaliating against her hateful critics, and taking back . her dignity. Getting back: To regain her confidence she did a pin-up girl photo shoot with a friend (pictured) Her own terms: Ms Seida said the new photo shoot helped her see herself as she wanted to be seen . She started by . finding out who had written the comments and sent them messages that . read: 'You're being an a******. 'Why don't you just do the right thing . and delete the post and stop sharing it?' 'I got a number of them taken down, but once something like this spreads it's out there forever' Next, . she used her training as a paralegal to send out hundreds of copyright . violation notices to each of the websites that had hosted her image. 'I . got a fair number of them taken down, but once something like this . spreads, it's out there forever,' she writes, adding that she still gets . concerned friends asking her if she knows her image is being used on . the internet.

Since the incident, she has taken to sticking up for people on similar websites, and she's also learned to keep a close watch on her privacy settings online. She also enlisted a photographer friend to do a retro pinup photo shoot with her, which helped her regain self-confidence and see herself as she really wanted to be seen.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 11:14 EST, 8 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:08 EST, 9 October 2013 . Betty Halbreich had something to share over brunch the other morning. 'I'm wearing a panty girdle,' allowed the 85-year-old personal shopping guru at the legendarily tony Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue - not a shocking revelation for a woman of a certain age who's spent her life impeccably attired. 'I've NEVER worn a panty girdle,' replied her brunch companion and co-panelist, Lena Dunham, the 27-year-old creator and star of HBO's Girls. Meeting of minds: Betty Halbreich, the legendary personal shopper at Bergdorf Goodman (left) appeared on a panel with Girls creator Lena Dunham (right) on Sunday . 'I know!' replied Halbreich. Big laugh from the crowd. Opposites may attract, but still, at first blush, it's a little hard to imagine what would unite Halbreich, the no-nonsense Bergdorf's doyenne who's been catering to her well-heeled clientele for nearly four decades, and Dunham, whose oft-scrutinized fashion choices - or, choices to wear little of anything at all on her show - seem as far from Halbreich's world as conceivably possible. But in a potentially delicious convergence of two radically different orbits, Dunham and Halbreich, 58 years her senior, are coming together for a project based on Halbreich's life. Dunham and co-writer Jenni Konner (also of Girls) are slated to write a comedy series, currently in development at HBO. Whenever that might happen, it's a proposition that raises lots of tantalizing style questions, as was clearly demonstrated at Sunday's brunch at Bergdorf's BG restaurant, an event put on by the New Yorker Festival and moderated by fashion writer Judith Thurman. 'Not my finest hour': Halbreich tells Dunham that the eyeshadow she wore to the Emmys made her eyes tear . For example: Jeans. Betty: 'I have to tell you, I've never worn a pair of blue jeans in my life. I've tried them on. Behind closed doors. They're very uncomfortable!' Lena: 'True. You need jeggings. Like these. Highly stretchable.' 'I've never worn a . pair of blue jeans in my life. I've tried them on. Behind closed doors. They're very uncomfortable!' Or eye shadow. Betty: 'I told you, that blue eye shadow at the Emmys made your eyes tear.' Lena: 'I know. The Emmys weren't my finest hour.' Or backsides. Betty: 'You realize that most people have never seen the back of themselves. They've never used a double mirror.' Lena: 'Maybe they don't want to know.' Or Dunham's controversial taste in fashion. Lena: 'I've been told I have terrible taste.' Betty: 'Who told you?' Lena: 'US Weekly.' Showing off her shorteralls: Dunham pictured with Patrick Wilson in a scene from season two of Girls. Both the actress and her character, Hannah Horvath, are known for their unguarded approach to style . The Sunday crowd was a refreshing mix of Upper East Side - undoubtedly clients of Halbreich - and younger fashion types closer to Dunham's age. Refreshing because each cultural subgroup seemed to appreciate the other. 'There's a pragmatic principle behind the way Betty dresses people,' Dunham said. 'It's very inclusive. There's room for everyone in her process.' She also noted how Halbreich 'is able to be in the fashion world, but also take it down a peg at the same time.' In her ninth decade, the engaging, blunt-spoken Halbreich is enjoying a rash of publicity; earlier this year she was highlighted in the documentary Scatter My Ashes at Bergdorf's. She likes to tell how her adventures in . personal shopping began. Working initially at the second-floor Geoffrey . Beene boutique, the store's head came to her after a year and asked her . why there was no record of any of her sales. Retail legend: Halbreich is the 85-year-old personal shopping guru at Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue . Turned out, she said Sunday, she was letting others register her sales, because 'I didn't want to use the cash register.' Even today, she notes, 'My hands have never touched a computer.' She asked the boss to set her up as a personal shopper, and the rest was history. Of course, Halbreich doesn't dress Dunham, and she didn't say much about her clothes, though she did seem to like Dunham's stylish red pointy boots. And they bonded over their nightgown collections - though Halbreich implied hers were private, whereas Dunham said she liked to share hers on Instagram. And as for Girls, the show that has made Dunham one of the best-known young personalities on TV? 'I've never seen it,' Halbreich said, without a trace of self-consciousness.","Dunham is writing a comedy series for HBO based on Halbreich's life .

"By . Ryan Gorman . PUBLISHED: . 00:03 EST, 21 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:00 EST, 21 September 2013 . One Yankee drugs cheat stole the spotlight from another on the day he announced his retirement. In a sequence of events almost too bizarre to be true, Alex Rodriguez hit his 24th career grand slam to pass Yankee legend Lou Gherig on the all-time list and set a new record only hours after admitted drugs cheat Andy Pettitte announced his retirement from baseball. Despite all three holding major records and having Hall of Fame caliber careers, only one was never called a cheat – and he wasn’t in pinstripes Friday night. Alone at the top: Alex Rodriguez watches his record-breaking home run . Up to the plate with the bases loaded in a tie game in the bottom of the seventh inning, Alex Rodriguez mashed the first pitch he saw from reliever George Kontos for a grand slam home run. The shot was his 24th career home run with the bases loaded, passing Lou Gherig (who has 23 such homers) to go into first all-time. It also gave the Yankees a badly needed 5-1 victory over the defending World Series Champion San Francisco Giants. A-Rod has a penchant for stealing others’ spotlights. In 2004, during the middle of the first World Series won by the Boston Red Sox since 1918, the shamed slugger shocked the sport by opting out of his then-record $250milloin contract with the Bronx Bombers. Only hours before, Mr Pettite announced his second retirement from baseball. Having retired after the 2010 season to spend more time with his family, the admitted HGH user came out of retirement prior to the 2012 season. Mr Pettite pitched 15 of his 18 seasons with the Yankees, the other three with his hometown Houston Astros. His 255 career wins place him among the all-time greats, but it's his playoff resume that turns heads. Hangin'em up: Andy Pettitte announced his second retirement at a Friday afternoon press conference at Yankee Stadium . With 19 postseason wins, he is the career leader – by a wide margin. These wins were against great teams playing at their peaks, remarkable by any measure. He is considered one of the greatest pitchers of his era, but will never make it to the Hall of Fame – instead eventually fading into obscurity with Mr Rodriguez. After admitting to using HGH during the 2004 season to heal an elbow injury, Pettitte likely sealed his fate despite having better career number than several pitchers enshrined in the Hall. Never needed help: Lou Gherig never used drugs, and played until ALS - eventually named after him - robbed him of the strength needed to play, and then eventually his life . While Pettitte has been allowed to go out on his own terms, Alex Rodriguez still has a legal battle ahead of him. An arbitrator’s hearing scheduled for Sept 29 looms large, and could force him into retirement whether he’s ready or not. A 39-year-old fading slugger suspended for 211 games does not return to baseball. While Pettitte’s story comes to an end, Rodriguez’s is long from over.","Alex Rodriguez hit his 24th career grand slam home run, breaking a tie with Lou Gherig for 23 .

Banksy has unveiled one of his most politically charged installations to date, which features a 1-800 number to a recording of a U.S. airstrike in 2007 that killed two children and a Reuters journalist. The work in New York is Banksy's comment on the Iraq war and shows a spray-painted car set in front of charging horses wearing night-vision goggles. The car, on the lower East Side, is surrounded with oil barrels and Banksy has stenciled a number on the side of one. The Banksy installation in New York's Lower East Side has been hailed as some of his most political work to date . A 1800 number stencilled on an oil barrel next to a spray-painted car takes the caller to a 39-minute recording of a 2007 air strike in Baghdad . The political installation has been cordoned off behind a chain link fence that is part of a month-long New York street art residency . The phone number takes callers to a disturbing 39-minute recording of an airstrike in Baghdad that was released by Wikileaks in 2010. Eighteen people, including a Reuters photographer and two children, were killed in the strike. The clip ends after an Apache helicopter crew is told that children have been hurt in the gun strike and are being rushed to hospital. A soldier is then heard saying: 'Well, it's their fault for bringing kids into battle.' Another soldier is also heard saying 'Think I just ran over a guy', followed by a burst of laughter. Hundreds of peole have already visited the site of the work since it was unveiled in Ludlow Street. It is part of Banksy's project, Better Out Than In: An Artists Residency On The Streets Of New York. This picture apparently shows Banksy dressed in overalls and a flat cap after a van broke down as he tried to prepare his installation in New York . Hundreds of people have flocked to see Banksy's latest installation, called Crazy Horses Riding Through the Lower East Side to a WikiLeaks Soundtrack . The installation features two spray painted vehicles, including depictions of men staring up at the horses with gun cross hairs pointing at them . The month long project began with photographs of Banksy’s work on the website BanksyNY.com. ‘The plan is to live here, react to things, see the sights - and paint on them,’ Banksy told the Village Voice in an email. ‘Some of it will be pretty elaborate, and some will just be a scrawl on a toilet wall.’ Starting on October 1, Banksy has used his stenciling technique to turn New York City buildings into his canvas. Naughty paperboys, a dog peeing on a fire hydrant, and a Band-Aid covered balloon have now appeared in Manhattan and Brooklyn - or did until they were quickly painted over. The stampeding horses are painted on the side of what appears to be a van. The politically charged work is Banksy's comment on the Iraq war . Banksy said in an email interview that some of his work during the residency will be 'pretty elaborate' while others 'will just be a scrawl on a toilet wall . The installation called Crazy Horses Riding Through the Lower East Side to a WikiLeaks Soundtrack is the largest of the residency so far. Fan Phillip Schoultz told New York Daily News: 'I thought someone was playing Call of Duty at first and then I realized. 'It's definitely one of his more serious pieces.' The eye-catching work comes after the reclusive Bristol-born tagger was apparently caught on camera for the first time. A man in a flat cap and paint-spattered overalls was photographed trying to fix a 'moving painting' in a van which had broken down, as part of the artist's month-long 'exhibition' in the U.S. The artist's real name is thought to be either Robin Banks or Robin Gunningham, but all that is known for sure is that he is from Bristol. Previously photographs purporting to show Banksy were taken in Santa Monica in 2011 and East London in 2007.","The 1800 number takes the caller to a 39-minute recording of a 2007 airstrike in Baghdad .

"By . Helen Carroll . PUBLISHED: . 16:59 EST, 9 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:08 EST, 9 October 2013 . My hairstyle had been the same for years; the heavy fringe I hid behind as a shy teenager was the exact same one I now used to hide my frown lines in my 40s. The heavy locks hanging below my shoulders were the same ones I’d scraped into a ponytail for PE as a schoolgirl, and which I now bundled up hastily as a mum on the school run. I'd tried with varying degrees of success to steer away from this hairstyle, but it remained my default setting for more than four decades. I admit I was starting to get a bit bored of the same image staring back at me from shop windows and mirrors. I'd long adapted my wardrobe to reflect my advancing years, so why had my hair remained frozen in time? Rolling back the years: Helen is happy with her new crop, right . Then I read I was not alone in feeling I'd reached a crossroads with my hair: a survey revealed that 46 - the age I'm about to turn - is seen as a pivotal age for women and their hair. This is the age at which many finally accept they’re nearer to 50 than 40, and opt for a more mature style. All my contempories agreed: it really was time to go for the chop and embrace life as a more groomed and - dare I say it - middle-aged woman. However, I was at a loss to know what would be the right style for a woman who may be past her prime but isn’t quite ready for the knackers' yard. So I was apprehensive when celebrity hairdresser Jo Hansford - whose clients include Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, no less - recommended a short layered bob, as sported by the evergreen Cameron Diaz. She assured me that, far from making me look middle-aged, it would actually knock ten years off my appearance. Star style: Cameron Diaz looks younger than her 41 years . Cameron does indeed look more youthful than her 41 years, but could that really be down to her hairstyle? The cut alone, I was told, would not be enough to complete the transformation. Although I'm a natural blonde, over the past few years so much grey has grown through that my crowning glory had begun to look more witchy-white than golden. So Jo recommended an all-over golden caramel tint with low-lights at the crown and highlights at the ends to give me a more youthful, sun-kissed look. As a mother of three with a demanding career and little spare cash to spend on myself, I was nervous about making changes that sounded so high-maintenance. 'As we age, longer hair can appear to drag our facial muscles down while shorter styles create the illusion of pulling them up, giving gravity a helping hand,' Jo Hansford told me. 'Your old haircut was triangular  - very heavy at the bottom and the length was weighing it down. 'You have a square-shaped head and chin (really?) so we'd suggest taking the length up above the shoulders, and putting in some graduation at the front, to soften these angles. Your hair would then frame your face, and we'd reshape the back to give it more bounce. 'Your fringe should sweep over to one side, like Cameron Diaz's, as this would soften your features, taking years off you. 'You look like the sort of woman who's too busy fussing with her hair to look after her children' 'Your old hair colour was luminous, so we will tint it all over to a more translucent, softer blonde, using golden caramel shades. This will look more sophisticated and should need re-doing no more than every couple of months.' While Jo's stylist, Evie Perkins, did my colour, the cut was done by senior stylist Marcio Oliveira, who insists the Cameron Diaz cut is the perfect style for fortysomethings like me. My hair, he told me, is twice as thick as and much curlier than the Hollywood star's, so he pared it right down to get it to lie as flat and look a little choppy like hers. And as my fringe was shorter than Cameron's, he created a kind of sweep-over, taking a chunk of hair from the right side of my head and training it to fall over to the right. 'Cameron will have a team of people whose job it is to make sure she always looks her best in public,' said Marcio. 'But with the right cut and blow-dry, women like you can achieve this look.' Not all happy: Helen's three children preferred her old hair style . So what was the verdict? If I'm honest, when I looked in the mirror after my blow-dry I got a shock. My hair has never been so short - or indeed dark, although, of course, it's still blonde. I felt immediately lighter, and more carefree, having shed several inches from the length, and a considerable amount more from the width of my hair. And, conscious that I'm wary of change, I decided to give it a day or two before deciding how much I liked the new me. But I wasn't bargaining on the reaction from my children - Daniel, 11, Isobel, nine, and Christian, five - when I arrived home. All three were visibly perturbed by my new appearance, insisting that I no longer look like their mother. 'We look as though we're out with a young childminder, not our mum!' Isobel, with her knack for getting to the nub of things, spoke for them all when she said: 'You look like the sort of woman who's too busy fussing with her hair to look after her children properly.' Sobbing at bedtime and insisting I could be an impostor pretending to be her mum, she begged me to go back to the salon and return to my old cut and colour, then left a note on my pillow saying: 'I want Mummy back!' The boys were equally unsettled, if a little less vocal about it. I'm sure Isobel thought she was just being reassuring when she called to them: 'Come and sniff her, she still smells the same. It must be Mummy.' My husband said I looked lovely and was amused by our children's reaction. Highly observant, he said he would never have known I'd had a tint if I hadn't mentioned it. His main concern then became how much it would set us back should I decide to maintain this new celebrity style (£380 every couple of months, though I didn’t tell him that). My sister, Louise, arrived later that night and told me the new look had indeed knocked a decade off my appearance. The following day I went for a walk with the children when Isobel, still giving me sideways looks, said: 'I hardly recognise you. We look as though we're out with a young childminder, not our mum!' Her brothers solemnly nodded their agreement. It was then I knew for sure that this is the cut and colour for me. johansford.com; 020 7495 7774 .","Helen Carroll had her hair styled like Cameron Diaz .

Innocent child: Chance after chance was missed to save murdered four-year-old Daniel Pelka, a report found today . The former children's chief who was blasted for failings by his former council over murdered schoolboy Daniel Pelka has stepped down from his new child protection post. Colin Green retired as director of children's services at Coventry City Council at the end of last month -  and promptly took up up the post of independent chairman of Tower Hamlets Safeguarding Children Board in London. However, he has now decided to withdraw from the post of chairman of the Local Safeguarding Children Board 'with immediate effect' - just two days after the move was announced. The news comes the same week a serious case review into the death of four-year-old Daniel Pelka found key opportunities were missed to intervene in his case by the city's children's services team, together with health professionals, school staff, police and other child protection agencies. Geoffrey Robinson, Labour MP for the area of Coventry where Daniel and his family lived, said he was 'stunned' when the news of Mr Green's appointment broke, which he claimed was 'an affront to public opinion'. He also called on the chief executive of the city council Martin Reeves, who this week apologised for the council's failings, to state what he knew of Mr Green's appointment and asked whether the council provided him with a reference for the job. Mr Robinson had said he planned to raise the appointment with the Government. Today, a spokesman for Tower Hamlets Council said: 'The new chair of Tower Hamlets Local Safeguarding Children Board, Colin Green, has decided to withdraw from the post with immediate effect.' The London borough council said Mr Green had been appointed by a multi-agency panel in June with all such decisions 'based on the merits of each applicant'. Daniel died of a head injury in March 2012, after a systematic campaign of emotional and physical abuse by his mother Magdelena Luczak and brutal former soldier and stepfather Mariusz Krezolek, both originally from Poland. Scroll down for video . Colin Green, head of Coventry's children's services, pictured right, that let down murdered schoolboy Daniel Pelka was awarded a new role in London.  Geoffrey Robinson, Labour MP for the area of Coventry where Daniel and his family lived, pictured left, said he was 'stunned' at the news . He was beaten, suffering a broken arm which needed hospital treatment, and arrived at school one day with two black eyes. He . was also kept locked in a box room at home, fed salt, and starved to . the point where he stole food from other pupils' lunchboxes and raided . school bins for scraps at playtime. Despite these signs, the serious case . review report authors found that nobody had ever spoken to Daniel . independently about his home life nor acted decisively to intervene in . his care. It also found the . child protection agencies had been taken in by the 'web of lies' spun by . Daniel's mother and stepfather, and should instead have been 'thinking . the unthinkable' about what was really going on. The . serious case review by Coventry Safeguarding Children Board, published . on Tuesday, concluded the young boy had become almost 'invisible' to the . people who were supposed to protect children from abuse and recommended . improvements to working practices, record-keeping and inter-agency . communication. Callous: Magdelena Luczak, the mother of Daniel . Pelka, and Mariusz Krezolek, his stepfather of Daniel Pelka battered him . to death after subjecting him to systematic starvation and . 'incomprehensible' cruelty . All agencies involved said they had learned lessons to avoid another case like Daniel's happening again. Luczak . and Krezolek were jailed for a minimum of 30 years each after being . found guilty of the defenceless youngster's murder in a trial at . Birmingham Crown Court this year. Mr Robinson, who had previously called on Mr Green to resign despite reports he was already planning to retire, said: 'Like myself, I am sure the whole of Coventry will be stunned to learn that Colin Green, former director of children's services at Coventry City Council has gone off to become chair of the safeguarding children board at Tower Hamlets. 'This is a clear example of senior . civil servants operating their own network for the benefit of . themselves, at the expense of front-line staff who have faced the real . challenges on a daily basis. 'The appointment is an affront to public opinion and confirms that I was right to call for a wholly independent inquiry. 'These boards are not truly independent.' Schoolboy: Little Heath Primary School in Coventry, West Midlands, where Daniel Pelka was a pupil. He used to scavenge food from bins in the weeks before he died because he was so hungry . He . added: 'Martin Reeves, Coventry City Council's chief executive, should . state publicly whether he knew of the appointment before it was made and . whether he or any of his senior staff provided a reference for Mr . Green. 'I shall be meeting . with Edward Timpson, minister for children and families, in the near . future and will raise this appointment with him as well as my concerns.' A Department for Education spokesman said: 'Local safeguarding children boards are independent of government - appointments are made by the chief executive of the local council.' He added the minister had already met with the MP. A spokesman for Tower Hamlets Council said: 'We can confirm that a new chair has been appointed to Tower Hamlets Safeguarding Children Board. 'The multi-agency appointments panel sat in June 2013 and all appointment decisions are based on the merits of each applicant, their suitability for the post and information available at the time.' Mr Robinson has applied to have an adjournment debate in the House of Commons on the wider issues surrounding Daniel's death. He has also called for a clearer line of responsibility for reporting for people with concerns about child abuse or neglect. There have also been calls for a public debate on whether a change in the law is needed, placing a mandatory legal duty on anyone who works with children to report their suspicions of child abuse. Local safeguarding children boards were introduced under the Children Act 2004 and bring together representatives from health, education, social and children's services and other agencies responsible for protecting children from the area where they operate, and are chaired by an independent person. The boards' aims are to foster greater co-operation between the different agencies, leading to better joined-up working, improving the safeguarding and welfare of vulnerable children.Another key role of such boards is to carry out serious case reviews whenever a child dies where there is a suspicion of abuse or neglect.","Colin Green retired as children's director at Coventry City Council .

A mother suffered 'horrendous' burns after setting herself on fire because she repeatedly failed her driving test, a court heard. Yamkala Sapotka snapped when she learned she had not passed her test on the fourth attempt - despite having had more than 90 lessons, it was said. Today she walked free from court having admitted recklessly endangering the lives of others after the judge took pity on her. Free: A visibly scarred Yamkala Sapkota leaves court with her husband Yaduman, left, after a judge decided she should not be jailed for recklessly endangering others by setting herself on fire when she failed her driving test . The High Court in Edinburgh heard that Mrs Sapotka felt her failures were putting a burden on her family's finances and led to frequent rows with her husband. Judge Lord Bannatyne told her: 'I don’t believe there is any likelihood this will ever happen again.' Sapkota suffered 12 per cent burns to her face, head, neck, shoulder, right arm and back and under went operations to graft skin. She was psychiatrically assessed but was diagnosed as not suffering from any mental illness. Defence advocate Sarah Livingstone suggested that the 31-year-old had already paid a price. 'She has been punished by the terrible injuries she suffered. She is still receiving treatment for them.' Ms Livingstone said the scarring to . Sapkota’s back was 'horrendous' and she had to wear a special suit. Doctors took the view that she will be permanently scarred. When Sapkota appeared at the High Court in Edinburgh in August last year she admitted culpably and recklessly starting the fire, severely injuring herself and endangering the lives of others and property on June 28 2011. Judge Lord Bannatyne deferred sentence to allow Sapkota to show she could stay out of trouble. Trouble: Yamkala Sapotka failed her driving test four times despite having more than 90 lessons . As he admonished her today, the judge said it had been the right way to deal with the case. The court heard that Sapkota had failed her driving test for the fourth time despite taking more than 90 lessons. Her doomed efforts to get on the road had placed a burden on the family’s finances and led to rows with her husband. Sapkota set herself alight after leaving a suicide note penned in her native Nepalese, saying she no longer wanted to live. A neighbour was alerted and a 999 call brought firefighters to her flat in the Leith area of Edinburgh. They used breathing apparatus managed to rescue the semi-conscious woman. She had suffered burns to her face, back and arms. The court heard that the offence was wholly out of character. Sapkota was a first offender and has had a clean record since the fire incident. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said Sapkota was trying to harm herself and no one else. Sapkota and her husband moved to Britain nine years and he was working as a chef at the time. Advocate depute Stephen O’Rourke, prosecuting, said that on the day of the incident he had left for work. Sapkota said her husband Yadumen had told her to 'die if you want' after another row about the driving lessons and she was very upset. Mr O’Rourke said: 'The family’s financial circumstances were limited and it appears that the cost of the lessons were significant in that regard.' After the alarm was raised by the 999 call police arrived and could see smoke coming from under the door of the flat. As officers evacuated the stair a constable managed to force open the door but, as he went into the hall, he was stopped from going any further by the heat. Firefighters wearing breathing gear managed to reach Sapkota and she was taken out of the flat and paramedics gave her morphine and oxygen as she was taken to hospital.

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 06:50 EST, 17 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:21 EST, 17 May 2013 . Europe's most valuable living artist has found himself at the centre of an £8million lawsuit over a painting said to be one of his earliest works. Peter Doig has long admitted that as a teenager he ran away from home and moved to Canada, where he wandered the landscape taking LSD. But now a parole officer claims the future artist was arrested for drug possession, and spent several months in juvenile detention. The officer says that he spotted the young Mr Doig's artistic talents, and bought a painting from him for $100 - and now he is demanding that the painter authenticate the work, which could be worth millions. Dispute: A former parole officer is suing artist Peter Doig over this painting, claiming he bought it from the Scotsman while he was serving time in detention for drug possession . The Scottish-born artist, 53, insists the picture is not in fact his work, and dismisses the allegations as a fabrication. Mr Doig set a record for the highest price ever fetched by a living European artist in February of this year, when his work The Architect's House in the Ravine was sold for $12million (£7.8million). Before attending art school in London . as a young man, he spent several years in Canada - but has never made . it entirely clear what he was doing there. Robert . Fletcher, who worked as a parole officer at Thunder Bay Correctional . Centre in Ontario in the mid-1970s, claims he came across the teenaged . Mr Doig while he was serving a five-month sentence for possession of . LSD. Denial: Mr Doig insists the work is not by him and says he was not arrested as the man claims . In papers filed at a federal court in Chicago, he described seeing him work on a painting of a desert landscape, painted on a linen canvas measuring 34in by 41in. According to the Courthouse News Service, the documents continue: 'Fletcher helped Doig in his search for employment, and helped him to obtain employment through the Seafarers Union in Thunder Bay. 'Fletcher also encouraged Doig to pursue his artistic talent, and accepted Doig's offer to sell the work to Fletcher for $100. 'Since that day in or about 1976 and to the present, Fletcher has owned the work.' The painting is signed with the name 'Pete Doige', which Mr Fletcher claims was the name Mr Doig used during his time in detention. The former parole officer says that a friend suggested to him that the work could be by the artist, due to its similarities to other landscapes by Mr Doig. Some experts have pointed out that its eery atmosphere and empty landscape are reminiscent of the artist's other works, but others claim that it is not impressionistic enough to be by him. Mr Fletcher is now attempting to sell the work through a Chicago gallery - but the painting will only be considered valuable if it is authenticated by the artist himself. Mr Doig has vehemently denied that the picture is his, saying he has not been to Thunder Bay and was never jailed on drugs charges. Record: The Architect's Home in the Ravine by Mr Doig was sold for $12million (£7.8million) in February . Similarities? Some experts compare the painting to works such as Canoe-Lake, pictured, but others disagree . His dealer, Gordon VeneKlasen, wrote in an email to Mr Fletcher: 'Not only does Mr Doig not know the owner of this work, he has never been to the place it is supposedly painted. 'The painting is NOT by Peter Doig. Anyone can see that. We are not interested in any further communication related to this. 'Good luck in finding the real artist for this. Any attempt to attribute this painting to Peter Doig in any way will be dealt with by our attorneys.' Mr Fletcher is hoping a judge will declare that the work is in fact by Mr Doig - which could raise its value to many millions of dollars. He is also seeking damages from the artist, claiming that he has 'interfered with prospective economic advantage' because his denial lowers the painting's value. Mr Doig's lawyer told the Independent: 'The case has absolutely no basis in fact. The painting is not a Peter Doig and the allegations have been entirely fabricated.'","Parole officer claims he bought artwork from teenaged Doig in prison .

As creative consultant for luxury leather goods brand Smythson and ambassador to the British Fashion Council, Samantha Cameron is usually admired for her chic, pared-back style. However, opinion was divided on the unusual 'half-calf' boots with neoprene panels she wore yesterday on the school run. As the name suggests, ‘half-calf’ boots . sit higher than ankle boots but fall some way short of the knee. Unlike . ankle boots, which stop at the narrowest part of the leg, these draw . attention to the calf. Unflattering: Samantha Cameron wore a pair of £80 'half calf' boots on the school run in the London sunshine on Tuesday but fashion critics weren't impressed . Some critics carped that the usually . impeccably dressed . 42-year-old had missed the sartorial mark - mainly due to pairing them . with a knee-length skirt, which had the effect of truncating her long, slim legs. As Samatha has found, they are not the easiest style to pull off. But whoever said fashion was easy? They have been identified in fashion circles as a key trend for autumn, with similar shapes appearing on the Stella McCartney, Chloe and Jason Wu catwalks and now filtering on to the high street. So, if you're tired of ankle boots and bored of bikers, why not give them a whirl? On trend: Teaming these boots with a knee-length skirt was a mistake, say fashion critics . If you're looking to jump on the trend without breaking the bank, Topshop offer their AEON Neoprene Chelsea Boots for £78. Got some cash to splash? Then Charlotte Olympia's £911 'Lucinda' mid-calf boots will fit the bill. To help you avoid a SamCam-style footwear faux pas, we have called in some of the industry's most reputable stylists to give their verdict on how to pull off the look. Toni Jones of blog 30ish Stylist, said: ‘SamCam’s feet are suffering from transitional trend issues. 'Most women with their finger on the fashion pulse will have snapped up key pieces for their autumn wardrobe already, especially coats and boots as these are the first things to sell out, but the long summer is leaving us itching to wear our new season buys. 'It seems that Sam couldn’t wait to wear her Stella copies with trousers or tights and has taken a leaf out of the street style stars hanging around fashion week tents in midi skirts, bare legs and clumpy ankle boots. '""F-ugly"" boots are the ultimate way to toughen up a girlie look and very hot right now. 'Samantha definitely has the legs for this look, but unfortunately only a 20-something can pull of such a contrasting style with conviction.

Principles by Ben De Lisi black cross strap high ankle boot, £65 . Fashion stylist Courtney Smith who has worked with Kelly Rowland and Sarah Harding, said: ‘Actually, as far as half-calf boots go, these aren’t the most unflattering I've seen. She's lucky she has slender legs, however it definitely isn't doing any favours at lengthening them or making them appear slimmer. 'Black tights would work really well here, as they would elongate the leg and blend into the boots. 'The main problem is the length of the skirt teamed with those boots. If the skirt were shorter, it would balance out the legs and body better than the midi style she's chosen.' Laura Puddy, who styled One Direction on X Factor, added: 'SamCam is always super stylish but wearing these boots with black opaque tights or jeans would be much better than a bare leg as it would streamline the look.'

Speaking about recovering from her own surgery, Elle said: 'I couldn't move without being in terrible pain. The bra the hospital gave me to wear while I recovered was so uncomfortable. 'I had no idea women were having to make do with such uncomfortable bras after surgery. I realised I needed to come up with a new design.' In her former career, Elle modelled lingerie and swimwear for magazines including FHM. Her hostessing work saw her attending celebrity parties, but she decided the perks were not enough to offset the constant physical pain.

The Hospital Bra was designed with ease of access and comfort in mind, and is made from naturally antiseptic bamboo derivative . Explaining, Elle said: 'I developed quickly and by the time I was in my late teens, life with my breasts was a nightmare. 'In school, I was badly bullied. The girls suggested I was padding my bra, while boys just didn't leave me alone. 'Worst of all was the agonising pain. My breasts were just far too big for my frame, leading to chronic back and neck ache.' She was eventually approved for NHS surgery in March 2012 to reduce her breasts from size 32HH to 32F. She said: 'Lying in my hospital bed, I struggled with the post-operation pain. I was in agony. My chest was unbearably sore and tender. 'What made matters worse was that the standard recovery bras I was advised to wear by the hospital were incredibly uncomfortable. 'The bras available were very difficult to put on, weren't easily adjustable and quite inaccessible for medical staff when it came to changing dressings and aftercare. 'I realised my uncomfortable bra was the last thing I should be worrying about. So I took out my notebook and designed a completely new bra.'

Elle, pictured before her surgery, had the NHS reduction due to chronic back pain as a result of having large breasts on a small frame . The Hospital Bra was designed with ease of access and comfort in mind, and is made from naturally antiseptic bamboo derivative. Elle, who had a benign growth removed from her breast following a cancer scare when she was 19, has found loyal customers for the £45 bra among women who have had treatment for breast cancer, including those who have had mastectomies. She said: 'The first run of 100 bras sold out very quickly. In June I took delivery of my first main batch of 2,500 bras. 'I've visited very poorly women in their homes for fittings, and I'm honoured to serve them. 'I understand something of the emotional turmoil women go through when they deal with cancer. If the bra I've designed can do anything to help them, then I consider myself very lucky. 'Helping those women has been the most rewarding experience of my life. I'm hoping to open up a sanctuary for women to have a place where they can have wigs altered, have recovery bras fitted and get nipple and eyebrow tattoos, all under one roof. 'I've met some amazing ladies and learned a lot. Many of them have become great friends.'

Tracey Norris, of the Tring Bosom Buddies cancer support group, left with Elle Terry-Dawson . Elle, who owns Gorgeous lingerie boutique in her hometown of Tring, Hertfordshire, is currently in talks with NHS Trusts about introducing the Hospital Bra to recovery wards. The bra is already in use in private surgeries, and has been recommended by Bosom Buddy therapy groups. Tracey Norris, 56, leader the Tring Bosom Buddy cancer support group said: 'Elle has done a brilliant job listening to the difficulties women experience with post-surgery bras. 'What you get in an NHS hospital is often not very good, but Elle's bra is so comfortable it can be worn even after you leave hospital. 'Approximately 55,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year in this country, and they deserve access to meaningful, personalised service during and after their treatment. This is exactly what Elle provides.'","Elle Terry-Dawson, 27, from Tring, designed the Hospital Bra .

Wanted: Samuel Nathan Duran is suspected in the shooting of at least three, maybe four, police officers . A thug who shot three officers - including one in the jaw - has surrendered after hours spent barricaded in a California home. Samuel Duran, 32, of Roseville, initially shot an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Friday afternoon before shooting three local police who pursued him, said authorities. Mr Duran took cover in a nearby home and was engaged in a long standoff with police before they had him surrounded. A SWAT team was stationed around the property, as police made repeated calls for him to emerge, calling: 'We have the house surrounded. Come out with your hands up'. Meanwhile family members gathered outside encouraging him to give up the fight. After a robot was sent in at 11pm, and a negotiator spoke to Mr Duran on the phone at 12.30am, he emerged and was taken to hospital for a medical examination in an ambulance, CNN reported. He will then be taken to jail. Armed with an assault-type rifle, Mr Duran had taken hostages but they somehow were able to sneak out of the home's back door, according to a police spokesperson. A known gang member currently on parole, Mr Duran's criminal record shows charges for carjacking and resisting arrest, according to News 10. The violent thug fled the scene of the first shooting - where he shot an ICE officer in the leg just after 3pm - ran to a nearby house and kicked in the door while being chased by authorities, according to reports. The other three officers shot were hit in the shoulder, jaw and an unspecified body part, police said. Police had been searching for the wanted man for the past week, according to the Roseville Police Department. He was wanted for recent incident involving a knife, family members told News 10. He also fired at officers trying to establish the six-block perimeter, according to reports and may have been wounded in the exchange, according to the Roseville Press Tribune. The officer shot in the jaw is in serious condition, two are stable, according to Roseville Police Chief Daniel Hahn, who briefed local media. The officer struck with a bullet fragment has been released from a local hospital, the department announced. 'They came to work today to do their job… and a very violent . person injured them, we’re just hoping they recover quickly,' he added. Chief Hahn declined to name the officers and federal agent, but did confirm they are all force veterans, and are male. Mr Duran's aunt claimed late Friday . night to CBS Sacramento that the fourth officer was actually shot by his . partner, and that she has it on video. 'Sammy, you didn't shoot that cop, Sammy,' the woman cried out. 'Sammy, that other cop shot that cop.' 'Just . surrender yourself, get out, come on baby, come home, it wasn't your . fault Sam,' she continued. Her claims are unsubstantiated as of this time, the video has not yet surfaced. Going to be there a while: Officials have set up a command post and have dug in for what may be a long, tense negotiation . On the move: A sheriff's deputy is among the officers converging on the house where Mr Duran is holed up . Going over the game plan: Officers from multiple agencies, including the nearby Sacramento Police Department, plan their next course of action . Other family members who spoke to CBS Sacramento  also pleaded to him to turn himself in. 'We love you Sam, if you're watching please come out,' a cousin told the station. 'We want him to surrender, but we want it to be a safe surrender,' the family member said. 'We want him to have a fair chance.' The home owner fled as soon as she saw him run through her yard, she told KCRA. ‘It's really scary to know that he's in there,’ said Brenda Bell. Her pets remain in the home. Another neighbor told KCRA that he saw Mr Duran enter Ms Bell’s backyard holding a handgun and immediately called it to the attention of police in the area. Move along people: A Sacramento Police officer directs bystanders away from the potential line-of-fire as police converge on a house where Sammy Duran is suspected to be residing . Spring in their step: Two sheriff's deputies jog during the standoff . ‘We have the perimeter surrounded, we have him locked down,’ Roseville Police Lt. Cal Walstad said during an evening briefing. The known gang member was targeted in a joint investigation being conducted by federal agents and the Roseville Police Department, according to the Sacramento Bee. Police had been searching for Mr Duran for a week when the ICE agent came in contact with the violent criminal. The initial shooting put area schools on lockdown throughout the afternoon, Fox 40 reported. It is not clear if those student have yet been allowed to return home. Roseville Police announced late Friday evening that lockdown orders had been lifted. At one point, three-quarters of a mile of the town, about 20 miles northeast of Sacramento, was completely locked down, KCRA noted. 'This is the biggest police operation of its kind in the region in recent history,' said Chief Hahn.","Samuel Duran has surrendered himself after hours barricaded in a home .

But for the Royal Family yesterday, it seemed to be little more than a distraction in their hectic schedule. The Queen spent the morning hard at work on official papers – which arrive daily at her desk in battered old red boxes – before breaking off to be at her great-grandson’s christening. As well as attending to her paperwork, she managed to fit in both morning and evening appointments either side of the brief service at St James’s Palace.

The talks, which also included a tour of Clarence House’s private gardens to see a tree the peace campaigner had planted there last year,  began at 1.45pm and ended at 2.30pm. This gave Charles and Camilla just a few minutes to freshen up before meeting William and Kate with baby George at neighbouring St James’s Palace. If they were smarting at the lack of an invitation, they were determined not to show it. From the wilds of Canada to the West Country, senior royals who failed to make the cut for the christening were out in force. The Earl of Wessex – William’s uncle, Prince Edward – had a breakfast meeting at the Lanesborough Hotel in London in his role as trustee of the Duke of Edinburgh Awards.

He had several meetings, including with Bui Thanh Son, a Vietnam foreign affairs minister, and members of the Outward Bound Trust, as well as a holding a lunch for the Patron’s Company. His daughters Princess Eugenie, who is working in New York, and Princess Beatrice, were also left to read about the christening in the newspapers along with the rest of the public. Princess Anne was in Canada undertaking a series of engagements with a ‘military theme’. There was also no invitation for the Duke of Cambridge’s other uncle, Earl Spencer. He famously pledged at the Princess of Wales’s funeral to protect Princes William and Harry, who he described as his ‘blood family’. In recent years he has criticised the parenting skills of the Prince of Wales and his failure to visit Princess Diana’s grave at the Spencer family estate, Althorp in Northamptonshire. Delight: Kate holds George and walks with her husband Prince William and the Archbishop of Canterbury . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge decided not to invite several senior royals because they wanted the occasion to be an ‘intimate, family affair’. William and Kate had already chosen to break with recent royal tradition and have their son christened at the Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace, because it was smaller and ‘more personal’ than Buckingham Palace. By contrast, William’s christening in August 1982 was attended by more than 60 guests. Prince Andrew, who was serving in the Falklands War, and Princess Margaret, who was holidaying in Italy, were the only senior royals not in attendance.","Queen fits in morning and evening appointments either side of service .

California producer Truett-Hurst has launched the world’s first range of wines in square bottles. The range, called California Square, comes in three varieties: Russian River Valley Chardonnay, Paso Robles Cabernet and a red blend. Design firm Stranger and Stranger created the ornate bottles with embossing and vintage graphics. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Hip to be square: The new square bottles are world's apart from traditional rounded wine bottles . The unique square bottles are modeled on classic spirit bottles. The Dry Creek Valley wine producer felt a change was in order for the 'old, stodgy, ""square"" looking wine bottles' wine drinkers are accustomed to. Big deal: Actor Chris Noth reportedly enjoyed California Square wine at a pre-Emmys party last month . Why use the default option just because its been the standard for hundreds of years, went the thought behind the bottle. 'Square bottles take up less space but you never see them on the wine shelves. If the wine industry turned over to square instead of round bottles we'd save almost a million trees in outer cardboard boxes alone,' a press release for the product claims. In addition, says the company, the bottles won't roll away if placed on their sides, they can be repurposed as olive oil dispensers or vases, and they are easy to store - you 'don't need a wine rack, just some book-ends.' 'Introducing an alternative package is tricky,' Truett-Hurt winemaker Virginia Marie Lambrix says. 'The wine inside has to over-deliver and create a memorable impression for the consumer.' So, does the wine inside match up to the packaging? 'The three wines were a huge smash when Truett-Hurst and Total Wine & More featured them in a sneak preview prior to the 65th annual Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles in late September,' according to Truett-Hurst. The Truett-Hurst winery creates its California Square wines using biodynamic farming principles in Sonoma County, California.

The age old belief that people living on the West Coast of the United States are more relaxed and creative than those living in the east is now scientifically proven, following a 13 year study to map the moods of America. Researchers led by psychologist Jason Rentfrow, an American now working at the University of Cambridge in the U.K., analysed personality test data from over one million people to identify three distinct personality regions. They found people living in north eastern states tended to be temperamental and uninhibited, while those living along the West Coast were more creative and relaxed. The United States of mind: A 13 year study has created a personality map showing the varying moods of America from state to state . Meanwhile people living in the central and southern region were found to be more friendly and conventional. The study, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, collected data from over 1.6 million people over a 13-year period. The respondents were recruited by a range of methods including websites, advertising in the academic community and even social media platforms such as Facebook. They were given a choice of taking one of three different personality surveys, including one known as the the Big Five Inventory. This test was designed to measure a personality according to five key criteria -  Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism. And it was the results of this Big Five test threw up some of the most intriguing results. Utah was found to be the the most agreeable place in the country with Washington, D.C., the least. Split personalities: Laid back West Coast residents such as Californians . tend to be creative and relaxed while people living in the north . eastern states such as New York tend to be more temperamental and . uninhibited . And Utah was also determined to be the least neurotic place in the U.S., while West Virginia was found to be the most. If you live in Wisconsin you're likely to be an extrovert while but if you live in chilly Vermont, you're more likely to keep things to yourself. Hard-working South Carolina came top for conscientiousness, while it appears the people of Maine take a more relaxed attitude. Washington DC, was found to be the most open place - despite also being the least agreeable - while North Dakota finished bottom for openness. Professor Rentfrow told Time magazine: 'Political values may exaggerate the temperamental differences and a sense of tribalism may emerge. 'But these things all come from a mix of common personality types. The Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic may be very different from the Rockies and the West, for example, but openness is a big part of both personality profiles.'","13 year study used personality test data taken from over 1.6 million people .

A four-year-old girl accidentally drowned her younger brother in a tragic bath accident by turning on the taps, an inquest heard. Muhammad Hayan Khurram, two, died in just inches of water while his parents were out of the room. Muhammad, known as Hayan, had been left in a large bucket which was a third full with water and placed in the bath tub at his family home in Bradford. His older sister, who was the only other person in the room, had also wanted a bath and turned on the water while their mother was away collecting towels and tidying up. Tragic: Mary Burke, assistant coroner at Bradford Magistrates Court, above, recorded a verdict of accidental death after it was established that the four-year-old girl was strong enough turn on the taps . The four-year-old got undressed and turned on the taps, before climbing into the tub alongside her brother's bucket. Somehow the bucket, which the hearing heard that Hayan loved being bathed in, tipped over sending the young boy face down in the water where he drowned. His mother told the inquest, at Bradford Coroner's court, that his sister had been crying because she wanted a bath first on the evening of November 24 last year. She had left them alone for a few moments at their house in Crawford Street, Bradford, but when she returned she saw Muhammad face down in the water. Mrs Khurram said her daughter looked shocked and was now undressed and standing in the bath with taps running, saying 'Hayan fell over'. Mrs Khurram lifted her son out of the bath before taking him downstairs where she tried to revive him and dialled 999. Paramedics tried to revive the toddler but he later died at Bradford Royal Infirmary. A police investigation, which included a forensic post-mortem examination and testing, concluded that the young girl would be able to turn on the taps herself. Mrs Khurram told police her daughter loved her brother, was kind and caring and wanted to include him in everything she did. Earlier in the investigation Hayan's parents had been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter when Mrs Khurram lied to police about how the accident had occurred. Emergency: Hayan's mother called paramedics immediately when she found the youngster face down in the bath, they took him to Bradford Royal Infirmary but attempts to resuscitate the boy were unsuccessful . She told investigating officers that her son had been in the bath in a secure seat which had tipped forward. But after police questioned that version due to the seat's stability, she admitted that the toddler had been left kneeling in the bucket instead. Police later decided that no further action should be taken against Mr and Mrs Khurram. Hayan had previously been diagnosed with developmental problems, which included difficulties with communication, sitting upright and also meant he had to be fed with soft food. The day before his death the two-year-old had been to a clinic for a check-up, the inquest heard that there was nothing medically that contributed to his death. Recording a verdict of accidental death, assistant Bradford coroner Mary Burke said: 'This is a most tragic set of circumstances that certainly was never predicted and certainly not intended.'","Hayan Khurram was sitting in a 'third full' bucket of water in an empty bath .

Costa, which has 1,212 UK stores, saw like-for-like sales rise 7.1% in the 13 weeks to November 29, compared with 6.8% in the first half of the year, parent firm Whitbread said. The strong performance came as it emerged that Starbucks paid just £8.6million in corporation tax in 14 years of trading in Britain and nothing in the last three years. Perking up: Costa Coffee reported a big increase in sales today as rivals Starbucks and Caffe Nero face growing anger over their tax avoidance practices . While Starbucks has since changed its tax arrangement so it will pay around £10 million in corporation tax this year, the revelations sparked a customer boycott and protests, and analysts have suggested that Costa could benefit from the bad publicity. Meanwhile, Caffe Nero reportedly paid no corporation tax last year despite making profits of almost £40 million. Costa saw total system sales in the 39 weeks to November 29 rise by 21.9% to £733.9 million, within which franchise sales were up 18.7% to £295.7 million. Its UK retail store sales grew by 20.1% to £399.2 million in the period. Whitbread plans to open 330 net new stores worldwide and around 1,300 Costa Express self-serve coffee bars in the full year.

Starbucks last week said it would make changes to its tax arrangements that will see the firm pay above what is required by law. The American firm made the announcement amid increased public pressure on multinational corporations to pay a fairer share of tax. The chain, along with Google and Amazon, was accused of 'immorally' minimising UK tax bills in a damning report by spending watchdog the Public Accounts Committee. It was reported that Costa paid £15 million in corporation tax on £377 million sales last year, compared with Starbucks’ £398 million in sales, on which it paid no corporation tax.

As politicians and cable news pundits spent the 16-day shutdown of . the federal government describing the apocalyptic scenario of the shutdown, the vast majority of ordinary citizens weren't . even phased by the fed being closed for business, according to a new survey. The Washington Post/ABC News survey, released Tuesday, finds that . 78-percent of those polled say they were not inconvenienced by the . shutdown at all. Of the 22-percent who said they were inconvenienced, 11-percent described their troubles as a 'minor inconvenience.' Barely missed: Only 11 percent of Americans say they were majorly inconvenienced by government shutdown . The survey was conducted October 17 through the 20th - after the shutdown had come to an end. The surveyors polled 1,002 adults, asking the question 'Were you . personally inconvenienced by the partial shutdown of the federal . government or not?' If a respondent answered yes, they were asked the followup question of 'was it a major inconvenience or a minor inconvenience?' Prior to the shutdown, the Associated Press explained how it would effect regular people, noting that it would have far-reaching consequences for some, but minimal impact on others. Deal: a deal to re-open the government was achieved on October 17 . AIR TRAVEL . Federal air traffic controllers would remain on the job and airport-screening staff would keep funneling passengers through security checkpoints. Federal inspectors would continue enforcing safety rules. Shutdown: The tourist trips to Alcatraz would stop running if the federal shutdown goes ahead on Monday . INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL . The . State Department would continue processing foreign applications for . visas and U.S. applications for passports, since fees are collected to . finance those services. Embassies and consulates overseas would continue . to provide services to American citizens. BENEFIT PAYMENTS . Social Security and Medicare benefits would keep coming, but there could be delays in processing new disability applications. Unemployment benefits would still go out. FEDERAL COURTS . Federal courts would continue operating normally for about 10 business days after the start of a shutdown, roughly until the middle of October. If the shutdown continues, the judiciary would have to begin furloughs of employees whose work is not considered essential. But cases would continue to be heard. MAIL . Deliveries would continue as usual because the U.S. Postal Service receives no tax dollars for day-to-day operations. It relies on income from stamps and other postal fees to keep running. Lunch is served: School students who qualify for free school lunches and breakfast will not go hungry even if the shutdown goes ahead this week . RECREATION . All national parks would be closed, as would the Smithsonian museums, including the National Zoo in Washington. Visitors using overnight campgrounds or other park facilities would be given 48 hours to make alternate arrangements and leave the park. Among the visitor centers that would be closed: the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island in New York, Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Alcatraz Island near San Francisco and the Washington Monument. HEALTH . New patients would not be accepted into clinical research at the National Institutes of Health, but current patients would continue to receive care. Medical research at the NIH would be disrupted and some studies would be delayed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would be severely limited in spotting or investigating disease outbreaks, from flu to that mysterious MERS virus from the Middle East. FOOD SAFETY . The Food and Drug Administration would handle high-risk recalls suspend most routine safety inspections. Federal meat inspections would be expected to proceed as usual. HEAD START . A small number of Head Start programs, about 20 out of 1,600 nationally, would feel the impact right away. The federal Administration for Children and Families says grants expiring about Oct. 1 would not be renewed. Over time more programs would be affected. Several of the Head Start programs that would immediately feel the pinch are in Florida. It's unclear if they would continue serving children. Safety first: Airport-screening staff will remain at work during the shutdown with safety being a top priority . FOOD ASSISTANCE . The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, could shut down. The program provides supplemental food, health care referrals and nutrition education for pregnant women, mothers and their children. School lunches and breakfasts would continue to be served, and food stamps, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, would continue to be distributed. But several smaller feeding programs would not have the money to operate. TAXES . Americans would still have to pay their taxes and file federal tax returns, but the Internal Revenue Service says it would suspend all audits. Got questions? Sorry, the IRS says taxpayer services, including toll-free help lines, would be shut as well. LOANS . Many low-to-moderate incomes borrowers and first-time homebuyers seeking government-backed mortgages could face delays during the shutdown. The Federal Housing Administration, which guarantees about 30 percent of home mortgages, wouldn't underwrite or approve any new loans during the shutdown. Action on government-backed loans to small businesses would be suspended. SCIENCE . NASA will continue to keep workers at Mission Control in Houston and elsewhere to support the International Space station, where two Americans and four others are deployed. The National Weather Service would keep forecasting weather and issuing warnings and the National Hurricane Center would continue to track storms. The scientific work of the U.S. Geological Survey would be halted. HOMELAND SECURITY . The majority of the Department of Homeland Security's employees are expected to stay on the job, including uniformed agents and officers at the country's borders and ports of entry, members of the Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration officers, Secret Service personnel and other law enforcement agents and officers. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services employees would continue to process green card applications. MILITARY . The military's 1.4 million active duty personnel would stay on duty, but their paychecks would be delayed. About half of the Defense Department's civilian employees would be furloughed. PRISONS . All 116 federal prisons would remain open, and criminal litigation would proceed. VETERANS SERVICES . Most services offered through the Department of Veterans Affairs will continue because lawmakers approve money one year in advance for the VA's health programs. Veterans would still be able to visit hospitals for inpatient care, get mental health counseling at vet centers or get prescriptions filled at VA health clinics. Operators would still staff the crisis hotline and claims workers would still process payments to cover disability and pension benefits. But those veterans appealing the denial of disability benefits to the Board of Veterans Appeals will have to wait longer for a decision because the board would not issue any decisions during a shutdown. WORK SAFETY . Federal occupational safety and health inspectors would stop workplace inspections except in cases of imminent danger. Cultural abyss: The National Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. would be one of many to close during a shutdown .

A woman walks past a building in Yemen where a father burnt his 15-year-old daughter to death . A father has burned his 15-year-old daughter to death for keeping in touch with her fiance. Police said a 35-year-old man had been arrested after the teenager's death in a remote village in the central Taiz province, in Yemen. The police website read last night: 'The father committed this heinous crime on the pretext that his daughter had been keeping contacts with her fiance.' Local news websites have reported that the father had caught the girl chatting by telephone with her fiance. Traditional tribal customs in parts of Yemen prohibit contact between men and women before marriage. Poverty and concern about 'family honour' prompts many Yemenis to marry off their daughters young, often below the age of 18 - a practice criticised by international rights groups. Yemeni authorities said last month they were investigating the death of the eight-year-old girl in northern Yemen. It was believed the child died from internal bleeding on her wedding night after being forced to marry a man five times her age. The girl, identified only as Rawan, died in the tribal area of Hardh in northwestern Yemen, which borders Saudi Arabia. Activists are now calling for the groom, who is believed to be around 40 years old, and her family to be arrested so they can face justice in the courts. Child bride: The practice of marrying young girls is widespread in Yemen and has attracted the attention of international rights groups seeking to pressure the government to outlaw child marriages . They say arrests would help put a stop to the practice of marrying very young girls to older men in the impoverished region. However, days later authorities presented a girl to reporters they said was Rawan alongside a man claiming to be her father. On camera he insisted angrily that only one of his six daughters is married, and it is not Rawan. 'They are all in good health and not suffering from anything and I deny this news.' Alive?: Yemeni 'child bride' said to have died on her wedding night has appeared in a video, it is claimed . There are currently 57.5 million child brides across the world, 40 per cent of which married in India. At this rate, the figure is expected to rise to 140 million by 2020. It . is a common custom among poorer families who rely on their daughter to . help herself and the rest of the family to build their income. In Yemen, more than a quarter of females marry before age 15, according to a report in 2010 by the Social Affairs Ministry. In Africa, 42 per cent; Latin America and the Caribbean, 29 per cent. In . India, almost half the population (46 per cent) of girls are married by . the time they reach 18, according to the National Family Health Survey. The practice of marrying young girls is widespread in Yemen and has attracted the attention of international rights groups seeking to pressure the government to outlaw child marriages. Yemen's gripping poverty plays a role in hindering efforts to stamp out the practice, as poor families find themselves unable to say no to 'bride-prices' that can be hundreds of dollars for their daughters. More than a quarter of Yemen's females marry before age 15, according to a report in 2010 by the Social Affairs Ministry. Tribal custom also plays a role, including the belief that a young bride can be shaped into an obedient wife, bear more children and be kept away from temptation. In September 2010, a 12-year-old Yemeni child-bride died after struggling for three days in labour to give birth, a local human rights organisation said. Yemen once set 15 as the minimum age for marriage, but parliament annulled that law in the 1990s, saying parents should decide when a daughter marries.","A 35-year-old man has been arrested in a remote village in Taiz province .

A Kansas judge is expected to make a ruling on whether a sperm donor who answered a Craigslist ad and signed away parental rights is responsible for child support. William Marotta and his wife are fighting the state’s efforts to seek child support from him after the Topeka mechanic provided sperm to a lesbian couple in 2009 for the purposes of artificial insemination. A decision is expected by the end of the year. Mr Marotta found the couple through an ad on Craigslist and signed a contract voiding his parental rights. The state of Kansas alleges he is the father and owes support, he is fighting that claim. Not my problem: William Marotta argues he is not responsible for the child's welfare . Lawyers for the state are moving to have Mr Marotta named the child’s father and have even requested a DNA test, which he said is not necessary because he is the father, according to the Topeka Capital-Journal. Though not contesting his blood relation to the child, Mr Marotta has argued the contract he signed with Angela Bauer and Jennifer Shriner disavowing his parental rights voids his monetary responsibility for the child. The state’s position is that since the semen donation was not made through a licensed physician, rather through the use of a catheter and syringe after he provided the semen sample in a cup, that Mr Marotta’s responsibility to the child is the same as if he fathered the child naturally. 'This is not a case about a sperm donor contract, it’s about child support,' Timothy Keck. an attorney for the state, said Friday, according to NBC News. Raising the child: Jennifer Schreiner (left) and Angela Bauer (right) signed a contract with Mr Marotta absolving him of all parenting responsibilities . Where it all began: Mr Marotta answered an ad placed by the couple on Topeka Craigslist . '[Marotta] cannot get out of his support obligations because he didn’t follow state law,' Mr Keck continued. 'The contract they drew up means nothing.'' State lawyers have cited a statute they believe pertains to this case as the reason for proving Mr Marotta’s need to pay child support. ‘The donor of semen provided to a licensed physician for use in artificial insemination of a woman other than the donor’s wife is treated in law as if he were not the birth father of a child thereby conceived, unless agreed to in writing by the donor and the woman,’ the law states. Mr Marotta’s lawyers argued that since this donation was done outside the presence of a doctor, the law has no application, nor does it provide guidance for how to proceed in such a case, according to the paper. The case ended up in court after Mr Marotta was ordered last year to pay child support to the couple, which has since split up. Lawyers for both sides have moved for a summary judgement in the matter, relinquishing their right to a trial, and have said they expect a decision by the end of the year.","William Marotta donated sperm to a lesbian couple after finding them through a Craigslist ad .

With years of training required to become an itamae - a traditional Japanese chef - it's not surprising that food is something of an art in Japan. But one creative cook has taken her technique even further - by literally creating 'sushi artworks'. Tama-chan - otherwise known as llustrator Takayo Chioyta - shapes her rice and seaweed rolls into a  range of designs, from bite-sized cartoons of cats and flowers, to copies of famous portraits such as Vermeer's Girl With A Pearl Earring and Edvard Munch's The Scream. Sa-scream-i: Tama-chan has created works of art that are exposed when she slices her rice and seaweed rolls . The Tokyo chef uses food dye, soy sauce and green wasabi to colour the rice to make her 'makizushi' or 'rolled sushi' creations. In traditional fashion, seaweed, rice and other ingredients - such as raw fish, ginger and vegetables - are laid out on a bamboo mat to be rolled up into one cylindrical wrap, ready to be cut into six or eight pieces. This is when Tama-chan lines up the components of her own makizushi, visualising how the cross-sections will look when everything is sliced up. 'I never know what the inside looks like so I'm never sure if it will come out the way I imagined,' the artist wrote. 'And I can't make edits when I'm done. 'Facial expressions are especially difficult because small ingredients or putting on too much force when you're wrapping the rolls can completely throw things off. 'It's always a special moment when I make the first incision to reveal an image.' Rice kitty: A plate featuring cats and flowers is one of the classics Takayo Chiyota recreates as a traditional Japanese dish . Sublime to ridiculous: Vermeer's Girl With A Pearl Earring - or a pot of instant noodles - the Tokyo illustrator lets her creativity run wild . Treasure trove: A full set of fish, seaweed and veg accompanies this bento box of delights . On her kookily-named website 'Sushi . smile of Tama-chan', the ]artist describes her mission to 'encourage . food education and enjoyment and get people to communicate' through her . fun food. 'When you see . that roll of rice, the thrill and excitement of not knowing what that . picture will look like until you cut it is unbearable!' she promises. Traditionally, Japanese sushi chefs train for up to 20 years - although shorter apprenticeships are more common in less exclusive restaurants, particularly outside Japan. An itamae - which translates as 'in front of the board' - needs to know the correct etiquette around customers, how to move about the kitchen and how to handle utensils. Sea-weird: Some of the creations echo the childlike cartoons of Japanese manga . Designer diner: Tama-chan often uses coloured rice in her creations . Under the knife: Skulls and a baby in the womb are among the more bizarre creations that Tama-chan exhibits to people who take part in her sushi-making workshops . Knowing by sight whether the raw fish is safe to eat or not is also a key skill. It . takes around five years of training for an apprentice chef to be . allowed to prepare the rice to the restaurant's particular recipe. They then graduate to 'wakiita' level . ('near the cutting board'), with the duty of preparing fresh . ingredients, before becoming a fully-fledged itamae. But . Tama-chan has set up workshops offering Tokyo residents the chance to . watch her make her sushi artworks and have a go under her watchful eye. The sushi designer also offers courses in English to give foreigners the chance to prove their credentials as the next rice Rembrandt.

The Queen is being urged not to sign a Royal Charter drawn up by politicians to oversee regulation of the Press . A powerful group of the world’s leading Press freedom organisations has written to the Queen urging her not to sign a Royal Charter drawn up by politicians to oversee regulation of Britain’s 300-year- old free Press. In a strongly-worded letter, they warn that the ‘toxic’ charter – written by the three major political parties and the Hacked Off lobby group – will have a ‘chilling’ effect on journalism in the UK. But it will also be used by dictators around the world to muzzle the Press in their own countries. They also say Britain will be unable . to exercise a leadership role in arguing for human rights at next . month’s Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Sri Lanka if the . charter is approved by the Privy Council and signed by the Queen next . Wednesday. The letter – . signed by bodies including the World Press Freedom Committee, . International Press Institute and Commonwealth Press Union Media Trust – . came as a poll suggested that 68 per cent of the public believed . politicians would exploit the proposed framework to dampen criticisms . and restrict free speech. Only 13 per cent of those questioned by pollsters Survation for the Free Speech Network agreed the Royal Charter would result in a ‘more vibrant and independent Press’ while 62 per cent said the new system should not give politicians the final say on regulation. This month, the three main political parties agreed the detail of a charter designed to impose a system of newspaper regulation in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry. An alternative charter proposed by the Press – which would have given an independent regulator strong investigative powers and the right to impose fines of up to £1million, up-front corrections, with inaccuracies corrected fully and prominently, and independence from the industry and politicians – was rejected. It is thought to be the first time that the Queen has been asked to sign a Royal Charter forcing a system of regulation on an unwilling industry. In their letter, the organisations told her: ‘No one should be in any doubt that the charter which politicians are forcing Your Majesty to sign is, despite the camouflage, a set of repressive statutory controls being imposed on the Press. ‘That should not be the function of a Royal Charter. By laying down rules about how that regulator must work and how the ethical codes that bind the Press should be written, this toxic charter brings Parliament for the first time ever to the heart of the newsroom. ‘It breaches the fundamental principle that politicians must never get involved in editorial content regulation. And it lays the foundation for fully fledged statutory controls. ‘That will have a chilling impact on journalism throughout the United Kingdom – from the biggest national newspapers to the smallest local and regional papers and magazines – weakening democracy.’ This month, the three main political parties agreed the detail of a charter designed to impose a system of newspaper regulation in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry . If the UK moves to control the Press through the law, it will have ‘a terrifying knock-on effect throughout the Commonwealth and much of the developing world where  Britain has a key leadership role’, the letter warned. ‘The fact this is being done by Royal Charter – an instrument traditionally used to grant rights – will make that infinitely worse because of the respect in which you personally, and the Crown institutionally, are held. ‘The actions of Britain’s Parliament will be used as an excuse by those who want to muzzle the Press in their own country – and there are many governments who would love to do so. And it is your name, Your Majesty, that will regrettably be taken in vain. ‘If it is good enough for the Queen, it is good enough for us.’ ‘Already we have seen the chill winds of what is happening in the UK in South Africa, Botswana and Sri Lanka. Many more will follow.’ It warns the charter would be ‘seized on by enemies of free speech everywhere eager to impose similar controls’. It added: ‘This issue is of huge importance in the UK. It is important for Britain’s standing in the world. But above all, it is important for the impact on countries not nearly so lucky as the many of us in Europe who until now have enjoyed fundamental freedoms.’ Guardian editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger, who has been critical of the rival publishers’ plan, said the charter is a ‘medieval piece of nonsense’. Speaking in a debate on Tuesday organised by the London Press Club, he condemned the cross-party regulation plan.","Press freedom organisations write to Queen urging her not to sign a Royal Charter drawn up by politicians to oversee regulation of the British Press .

Jailed: Youth baseball coach David Scott Engle has been sentenced to 25 years for child pornography . A youth baseball coach who amassed thousands of child pornography images and videos was  sentenced to 25 years in prison on Monday. David Scott Engle, a divorce lawyer from Lake Lucerne in Washington, will now stand trial on child rape charges after investigators found dozens of videos of him allegedly raping two boys. The 50-year-old, who was arrested in November after buying child pornography online, also had a collection of 450 images showing the clothed genitals of the boys he coached. Engle was sentenced on federal child pornography charges but allegations that he raped one boy 'countless' times over six years remaining outstanding in state court. When police searched his house and a storage unit they found the stash of home-made and bought child pornography, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. The baseball coach for 11 and 12 year olds had gone to great lengths to have contact with children, and amassed an extensive collection of child pornography featuring boys the same age as the ones he coached, the court was told. Before his arrest, Engle had coached a youth baseball team, was president of Maple Valley Pony Baseball and Fast Pitch, served on two regional baseball organizations and one baseball business. Assistant U.S. Attorney Marci Ellsworth said the former coach abused the trust parents placed in him. 'While [Engle] was purportedly serving as a role model and mentor for these young boys, he was sexually interested in them,' Ms Ellsworth said in court papers. 'When [he] was taking pictures and shooting video of baseball games, his camera was focused on the players’ crotches, not on their batting stance, pitching arms, or any other aspect of their athletic performance.' Engle pleaded guilty in July to federal child pornography charges and admitted possessing hundreds of videos of children being sexually abused. Now he has been sentenced on those charges, the child rape case can proceed with any state sentence following on from the 25-year term just handed to Engle. King County prosecutors have charged him with three counts of child rape over allegations that he was shown raping a boy in several videos. About 1,400 photos and 40 videos allegedly show Engle raping one boy, and three videos show abuse of a second child. 'Betrayal of trust': The court heard the Maple Valley coach went out of his way to have contact with children . In one Engle filmed himself watching baseball on TV as the boy he was raping struggled and told him 'No'. The assaults only stopped after his arrest. 'This . is a heart-wrenching betrayal of trust of the victims and the . community,' U.S. Attorney Jenny A. Durkan said in a statement. Engle was caught after postal inspectors joined an international investigation into a website dealing in child pornography. He spent $2,300 on videos and photos sent to him by the company between 2005 and 2011, according to Q13Fox, but when police raided his home they found child pornography well beyond the purchases he made from the website they had been investigating. His 'collection of child pornography consisted predominantly of young boys in the same age range as those [he] coached in youth baseball,' Ms Ellsworth told the court. She added: '[Engle] had many pictured of the boys he coached – including nearly 450 pictures of their clothed genital regions – which, although … not pornographic in nature, are nonetheless disturbing.'","David Scott Engle jailed for 25 years over child pornography charges .

Boris Johnson has been named the most influential man in Britain, edging out George Osborne, Prince Charles and even Prime Minister David Cameron. The Mayor of London, who won plaudits for his handling of the widely-praised Olympic Games, triumphed over luminaries in politics, showbusiness and top executives in a list published by GQ magazine. The list is heavily influenced by the Summer Olympics, with cyclists Bradley Wiggins and Chris Hoy reaching 15th place, and runner Mo Farah hitting 34th following his two gold medals. Power: Boris Johnson has been named 'The Most Influential Man in Britain' by GQ magazine . Gamesmaker: The London Mayor was praised for his handling of the Olympic Games and is noted for his high-profile appearances, such as his encounter with a faulty zipwire in London's Victoria Park . Other top Tories in the list include Cameron, Chancellor George Osborne, Education Secretary Michael Gove and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. The Royal Family was also represented, with the Prince of Wales in 12th and Prince Harry at 18th. Prince Harry was deemed far more . influential than his brother Prince William, the third-in-line to the throne, who was . given 33rd place in the list. The Prince hit the headlines for both his military service in Afghanistan and the pictures that emerged of him partying naked in a Las Vegas hotel room. In what appears to reflect the television programme Yes, Minister, where a civil servant guides the decisions of the minister he is meant to be serving, Sir jeremy Heywood, cabinet secretary, was voted more influential Prime Minster David Cameron. Cycling heroes: Gold medalist and Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins (left) and Sir Chris Hoy (right) were both in the top 20 . The list, which is out in the February . edition of the magazine that will hit stands tomorrow, the top 20 is . heavily dominated by government figures, with seven political players . being included. A spokesman for GQ told the Telegraph . that the Leveson Inquiry had replaced press power with 'institutional . scrutiny and new-media guruism'. She said that the list had a large . proportion of old-Etonians and wealthy figures who were more guarded . about their private lives after the explosion of web gossips who . discussed the details of the rich and famous. She added: 'Untrammelled power like that wielded by Rupert Murdoch is replaced by institutional scrutiny and new-media guruism. 'In reaction there has been a resurgence of the old guard – former Etonians dominate public life once more, including the mayor of London, the archbishop of Canterbury and the prime minister. Keeping it in the family: Prince Charles and his youngest son Prince Harry both made it into the top 20 - but surprisingly the Duke of Cambridge only made it to 33rd place . 'Meanwhile with the rise in power of web gossip factories, businessmen are much less willing to court the public eye. 'The flamboyant tycoons of the past have been replaced by more retiring figures who avoid the limelight. 'Money no longer shouts, it murmurs.'

But today police moved in on the largest Roma gypsy camp in the heart of Marseille days after the order was issued to dismantle the site. But by the time they arrived they found the ninety families who lived there gone, having slipped away into the night. All that was left was a forgotten ghost town of ramshackle huts, mounds of rubbish, wood, tyres and corrugated iron.

It is not known where the itinerants went as the long task of clearing up their village began. It comes a week after police sparked riots in France after officers dragged a 15-year-old Roma schoolgirl off a bus in front of classmates so she could be expelled to Kosovo with her family. Leonarda Dibrani was on a school trip when immigration officials boarded the school bus and arrested her. She later described being escorted from the bus. A teacher 'told me to say goodbye to my classmates. I told her it wasn't fair,' she said. Leonarda, who was deported to Kosovo with her family on October 9, said her life was now 'a nightmare' and that all she wants is 'to come back to France with my family'. The government says her family, who had been living in Levier in the Doubs region of eastern France, had been denied asylum.

Threatening: Released from the Vatican archives for the first time, this 1530 letter - a 3ft-wide parchment with 81 wax seals attached to red silk ribbons - sent by English noblemen urged Pope Clement VII to annul Henry VIII's marriage to his first wife so the king could marry Anne Boleyn . A group of English noblemen threatened the Roman Catholic Church when they wrote to the Pope urging him to annul Henry VIII's marriage to his first wife so the king could marry Anne Boleyn, a letter released by the Vatican has revealed. The document, signed by MPs and clergy including the Archbishop of Canterbury, alluded to the 'extreme remedies' they could pursue if Pope Clement VII refused their request. The 1530 letter - a 3ft-wide parchment with 81 wax seals attached to red silk ribbons - preceded Henry's divorce from Catherine of Aragon and clearly illustrates his rejections of the Pope's authority. It is one of 100 documents from the Vatican Secret Archives that yesterday went on public display in Rome's Capitoline Museums for the first time. The exhibition also marks the first time the documents have been allowed outside Vatican City. Henry VIII's split from Catherine of Aragon led to his breakaway from the Catholic Church and the establishment of the Church of England. The letter is considered a 'priceless document of great historical significance.' In historical terms, it has only recently been discovered, having been found in 1926 by Angelo Mercati, Prefect of the Archives, hidden in a chest built under a chair. The peers warn the Pope in no uncertain terms that 'a refusal of annulment would require recourse to extreme measures for the good of the kingdom which we would not hesitate to take,' and was sent from London in July 1530 taking two months to arrive on the Pope's desk. The Pope refused to annul the marriage, setting in motion a chain of events that led to a split from the Catholic Church and the start of the English Reformation. Among the other items on display is a 60-metre parchment scroll documenting proceedings of the Trial of the . Knights Templar medieval Christian military order, accused of heresy and . sexual misconduct. It is partially rolled out in one room of the museums, . alongside secret manuscripts, letters and codices. Elsewhere, a . register containing the excommunication of 16th century German reformer . Martin Luther, and a report on the 1633 trial of Italian astronomer Galileo . Galilei for asserting that Earth . revolved around the Sun, are on show. A . letter dated May 1887 from the Ojibwe Indians of Ontario to Leo XIII, . written on bark . birch and thanking him for sending missionaries to convert them, . colourfully alludes to the Canadian Spring as 'where there is much grass . in the . month of the flowers'. Sensitive . letters from before and during the Second World War have not been released - . the period is a contentious one as many historians have questioned . whether then Pope Pius XII did enough to speak out against Adolf Hitler. Archivist . Pier Paolo Piergentili said this is the first time in the archive's . 400-year history that it is opening up a selection of documents for . public display. He said: . 'The aim is to physically show the sources of history, and make . available the documents that have created history in Europe, and not . only Europe.' Documents . in the Vatican Secret Archives span the 8th to the 20th century and are . stored on 85km of shelving at different sites within the sovereign . state. Part of the collection is open for researchers upon request. Founded by Pope Paul V in 1612, the archives contain all deeds and documents pertaining to the government of the Church.

She died in 1535 . Among the other items on display is the 60-metre parchment scroll (right) documenting proceedings of the Trial of the Knights Templar in the early 14th century . Author . Dan Brown's blockbuster novel, and its subsequent film adaptation . Angels and Demons, focused heavily on the Vatican's archives with its . miles of dusty bookshelves and musty, . centuries-old documents. The . film shows it as a state-of-the-art building with bullet-proof glass . and electronic records. But in reality the archive is very different, with . a painstakingly complied handwritten card index. It is set across two floors below the . Vatican, is built to resist the effects of an atomic blast, and is . known affectionately to the archivists who work there as 'the bunker'. In . Angels and Demons, hero Robert Langdon - played by Tom Hanks - is seen . consulting 400-year-old documents relating to the trial of heretic . Galileo Galilei as he tries to crack a secret code. In a race against time, his assistant Vittoria Vetra decides . the best way to examine it is to rip the papers out as guards chase them out of . the archive with Langdon firing a gun wildly. Real-life, of course, is slightly more mundane. The signature of Galileo Galilei is seen on a document displayed as part of the exhibition. A report on the Italian astronomer's 1633 trial for asserting that Earth revolved around the Sun, is on show . The register of the Oaths of Fealty (1356-1359) to Pope Innocent VI is also on display.

But those who have tried and failed to take a quick nap on their keyboard without detection would do well to take a few tips from this baby squirrel. Because the tiny animal, called Rob, has proved he can sleep almost anywhere, from the inside of a coffee mug to its owner's laptop. Tired: Rob the squirrel falling asleep on Paul William's laptop. He lives with the wildlife expert after being seperated from his mother . Curled-up: Rob, the orphaned palm squirrel, is so small he can fall asleep inside a mug . Safe: The orphaned squirrel likes to keep warm in Paul William's breast pocket while he is at work . The baby palm squirrel, was taken in by wildlife film maker Paul Williams, 34, after it was separated from its mother and has spent a month nursing . him it back to full health. During the day, the palm squirrel sleeps in his owner's breast pocket to keep safe and warm, and when it crawls out, it has been seen catching forty winks in a coffee mug, outside a temple and on the side of a tree. Mr Williams was in Sri Lanka filming leopards and ancient temples when he found Rob in a car park in the dark. He said: 'I thought he was dead until I noticed a little twitch. I scooped up his weak, cold body and warmed him in my hands. 'My first thought was to try and put him back with his parents in the nest, so I put him into a safe spot as high as I could in the tree that I guessed he had fallen from. 'I covered him in a layer of tissue to help him keep warm. I hoped his mum would be looking for him and would hear him squeaking. Attached: When he is not inside Paul William's breast pocket, Rob clambers onto his shirt . Awake: The baby squirrel pops its head out of the mug after having a nap inside . Yawn: Rob the squirrel clambering on a branch and exploring, even though his eyes are closed . 'The next morning I came down to check on him, but he was still there.' Mr Williams, from Bristol, persuaded the rest of the crew from the BBC’s Natural History Unit to use high-tech equipment to search for the baby squirrel’s family. He said: 'We searched the area for any sign of other squirrels but we didn’t spot any. 'We then used our thermal camera, . which we are using to spot and film nocturnal animals in the car park. It’s great for showing warm patches where small animals are nesting. 'Unfortunately it showed us no thermal hotspots in any of the trees where Rob could have come from. 'I couldn’t just leave him. He would have died if I hadn’t have found him and so for now he’s an honorary part of the crew.' Small: The Indian palm squirrel is distinctive because of the three stripes on its back . Asleep: Rob having an impromptu snooze in front of a temple in Sri Lanka . Mr Williams has started nursing Rob the squirrel back to full health. He feeds the squirrel baby formula using a plastic syringe. The robust rodent, who was found in Wilpattu National Park in Sri Lanka, is fitting in with life among the television crew. He added: 'It’s not the smoothest of worlds to grow up in as we are often . travelling large distances in vehicles packed and loaded with kit, and . we spend all day - and much of the night - in the field. 'I’m concerned about monkeys and . stray dogs getting hold of him and so I tend to keep him in my breast . pocket during the day so that I can keep him warm and feed him . regularly. 'Since he opened his eyes he’s also become much more active and he doesn’t like being in his box. 'He’s jumped out once and to my surprise he ran straight into my hands where he curled up and fell straight to sleep. 'My aim was to fatten him up, get him . strong and then find a solution for releasing him. I can’t bring him . home, as much as I’d love to try. Orphaned: Paul Williams placed the baby squirrel high up in a tree and used thermal imaging to try and reunite the palm sqirrrel with its mother . Photogenic: It seems the baby squirrel is becoming as interested in wildlife as its owner while it perches on a camera in front of a temple in Sri Lanka . 'I’m looking into animal rescue centres or looking for someone to continue raising him and reintroducing him slowly. 'But for now I think I’m the safest pair of hands he has as in the past I’ve worked at an animal rescue centre in America to rehabilitate and release animals, mostly birds of prey, back into the wild.' Rob is an Indian palm squirrel which are distinctive due to the three stripes across their back. Palm squirrels, so named because they often make their homes in exotic trees, are usually weaned by their mother for ten weeks. They can live for more than five years in captivity. Young . Indian palm squirrels are often born with their eyes shut and it is . common for them to be orphaned in the early stages of their life. Their mothers are killed by predatory animals or suffer a serious injury which means they can no longer care for their infant. The young then start wandering further away from their nest in search of their mother and many become displaced. This . means, in the early stages of their life, they may seek another . individual to carry out their rehabilitation before they can be released . back into the wild. While they are being cared for, they will often find conditions which are similar to their nests so they can sleep. This means they will look for a well ventilated, but enclosed area so they are comfortable and not too hot .","Wildlife film maker Paul Williams, 34, took looks after the tiny palm squirrel .

A retired civil servant who spent 10 years sneaking out at night to put garden gnomes all over his tiny village kept the secret to his grave. The antics of Peter Leighton were only revealed in a eulogy by his son - and had mourners in hysterics. The 61-year-old had run rings round his 100 neighbours in the village of Brattleby, Lincolnshire - most of whom suspected it was a 'joker named Howard' who supplied gnomes to discount shop Poundland. But the secret was revealed at Mr Leighton's funeral on Monday after he lost an eight-year battle with prostate cancer. Peter Leighton, left, with his son David and proof of the family secret. They fooled neighbours for 10 years . Peter Leighton, 61, and his son David had to avoid crunching gravel, security lights and dogs to put the cheeky figurines on neighbours' lawns in their tiny village. Some were 'adopted' and kept there permanently . The gnomes' origin had villagers scratching their heads. Most suspected a man who supplied Poundland . His son David, 32, confessed in the final eulogy of the service. He said: 'Initially . we made the decision that in my eulogy that the truth behind the gnome . mystery had to figure and that it was appropriate. 'The funny thing is mum thinks gnomes are pretty tacky. Apparently they lower the value of your house by £500.' Mr Leighton's . wife of 34 years Erica, a retired midwife, said: 'I always knew Peter . was behind the gnomes. I didn’t want him to do it at first because I . thought it was a daft idea. A troupe of gnomes appeared under the village sign in Brattleby, Lincolnshire, in 2005. Mr Leighton's son David said: 'I remember being on the phone to dad saying there were reporters and film crews in the village and he was really laughing' 'He . loved to make people laugh and thought the idea that people would draw . their curtains and see a load of gnomes outside might raise a smile. He . was right, it did. 'When . he found out he was dying he said it was right to come clean and admit . it was him. He wanted his funeral to be happy and to amuse people. 'When . David read out the eulogy confessing all the people in church started . to laugh. It is exactly how Peter would have wanted it.' Pharmaceutical worker David was in on the prank from the start. He said: 'My cousin came round one day after his first ever visit to a pound shop in Lincoln, and one of the items he bought was a gnome. 'Dad said it would be funny to scatter gnomes around the village. He said he would pay for them but I would plant them. 'Me and my friend Ben had a map of the village and worked out a route of who had security lights and who didn’t. 'We carried two big rucksacks full of gnomes and had to contend with barking dogs and gravel. 'It was so much fun dad decided we should do it again.' As the prank grew it attracted the attention of the local and national media. 'I . remember being on the phone to dad saying there were reporters and film . crews in the village and he was really laughing,' said David. 'He couldn’t believe . it.

This is the dramatic moment a ferocious lightning bolt crashed against the Grand Canyon as dusk fell over one of the world's greatest natural wonders. The spectacular images captured the breath-taking landscape, which is thought to be 17million years old, being electrified into life as mother nature fired the fierce bolts towards the canyon walls. Huge streaks of white light illuminated the surrounding skies as the thunderstorm's gloomy, grey clouds gathered in Nevada in front of the setting sun. Electrifying: Stunning images show lightning striking the Grand Canyon . Landscape: Photographer Rolf Maeder managed to capture multiple strikes hitting the canyon under atmospheric stormy skies. Natural: The Grand Canyon is awe-inspiring as it is, but these jaw-dropping shots of lightning bring more drama to the natural wonder . Using low exposure techniques, photographer Rolf Maeder managed to capture multiple strikes hitting the canyon under atmospheric skies for the photo titled 'Night of Lightning at Grand Canyon. Mr Maeder specialises in taking photos of . wide-ranging landscapes. He told National Geographic Magazine: 'It was . such a wonderful experience to witness this beautiful thunderstorm far . across the Grand Canyon.' In his blog, Photography Sedona, he wrote: 'The raw power of it thrilled me equally as much as the fragility and simplicity in a picture of a seagull flying with the ocean gusts. 'Scott Stulberg, Holly Kehrt and I decided to do a sunset trip to the Grand Canyon, a two hour drive from Sedona. The evening and sunset was very hazy. So we decided soon to return home, taking it slow and visiting some more viewpoints. 'And then, at the Moran Point, we could enjoy this incredible lightning storm emerging at the east end of the canyon.' Gloomy: Grey clouds gather over the Grand Canyon as lightning starts to strike in the distance next to a break in the clouds . Backdrop: Rolf Maeder used low exposure techniques to capture multiple strikes, which are caused by humid conditions in late summer . According to the National Park Service, Grand Canyon National Park alone averages more than 26,000 lightning strikes per year. The lightning strikes are a probable result of the late summer North American . Monsoon, where storms can be seen every day in a variety of locations across the area. The monsoon delivers waves of moisture from the southeast, causing . dramatic, localised thunderstorms fueled by high temperatures. The other time the area receives showers is during winter when Pacific storms deliver widespread showers and snow at the highest points . The Grand Canyon is 277 miles long, up to 18 miles wide and is of over a mile. Nearly two billion years of the Earth's geological history has been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut their channels through layers of rock while the Colorado Plateau was lifted. Recent evidence suggests the Colorado River established its course through the canyon at least 17 million years ago. Since then, the Colorado River has continued to erode and form the canyon to its present-day configuration.

One in ten claimants stripped of the £15-a-week spare room subsidy have come off benefits altogether, figures show. The scrapping of the subsidy caused protests by Left-wing activists, who called it ‘the bedroom tax’ and claimed it would inflict misery on less well-off families. But Freedom of Information requests show that, in tens of thousands of cases, the move encouraged people to find a job. The scrapping of the subsidy caused protests by Left-wing activists who called it 'the bedroom tax' As a result, they no longer require any state support – delivering a huge saving for the taxpayer. Ministers had estimated that by removing the subsidy, paid to social housing tenants who have a spare room, the bill would be cut by around £500million a year. But, by encouraging people to stop claiming benefits such as jobseekers’ allowance altogether, this figure doubles to around £1billion-a-year. The new rules apply to housing benefit, typically worth between £50 and £100 a week. Since April, claimants of working age with a spare bedroom have received a reduced payment. The figures were revealed by Harry Phibbs, a Tory councillor, in an investigation for the ConservativeHome website. He surveyed councils across the UK and 141 responded. In their areas, 25,238 of the 233,732 people stripped of the spare bedroom subsidy – or nearly 11 per cent – were no longer claiming any benefits. Figures show the move has encouraged thousands to look for work . Mr Phibbs said that extended across the UK, it would be the equivalent of 71,000 out of the 660,000 claimants predicted to be affected stopping claiming benefits. ‘Before this change it wasn’t rewarding for people to work,’ he said. ‘This is giving people a reward for working – they are able to stay in their homes rather than downsizing into a smaller home. ‘Because work is now being rewarded, many people are coming off benefits altogether and getting full-time jobs. ‘I would expect you will see far more people coming in to jobs in the coming months.’ The ending of the subsidy means that if tenants have one spare room, the amount of rent eligible for housing benefit is cut by 14 per cent. If they have two or more spare rooms, the reduction is 25 per cent. On average, claimants receive £15 a week less from the taxpayer. Council tenants get about £14 a week less, while those in housing association properties get £16 a week less. The savings to the taxpayer from removing the subsidy are an estimated £505million in 2013-14, and £540million the year after. Figures obtained by Mr Phibbs show that in Tower Hamlets, East London, 948 out of 3,000 people (32 per cent) stopped claiming housing benefit, but in Liverpool only 300 claimants came off, out of 11,600. Bromsgrove in Worcestershire saw 178 out of 605 come off benefits (29 per cent). The responses do not give the reasons why individuals came off housing benefit, but any suggestion that the policy is helping families back into work is a huge boost for the Government. Left-wing politicians and campaign groups repeatedly said the ‘bedroom tax’ would inflict misery on thousands. Labour leader Ed Miliband pledged to reintroduce the subsidy, claiming its withdrawal was ‘unfair’ and would force families into real hardship.","Freedom of Information requests show thousands who were stripped of tax have been encouraged to find work .

A four-year-old boy who died after being deprived of food and locked in a homemade prison was abused for putting his shoes on the wrong feet, his stepfather told a court today. Daniel Pelka, of Coventry, West Midlands, died of a suspected head injury in March 2012 after being beaten and forced to sleep on a stained mattress in an act of 'incomprehensible cruelty'. Magdalena Luczak, 27, and her partner Mariusz Krezolek, 34, who are being tried at Birmingham Crown Court, both admit child cruelty but deny murder and causing or allowing the death of a child. On trial: Magdalena Luczak, 27, and her partner Mariusz Krezolek (both left), 34, of Coventry, West Midlands, are being tried at Birmingham Crown Court following the death of Daniel Pelka (right) in March 2012 . Today Daniel's stepfather gave evidence for the first time in the trial, saying how his partner would often shout at Daniel just for putting his clothes on inside out or his shoes on the wrong feet. He also claimed Luczak had an alcohol problem and often smoked marijuana, which led to her losing her tempter. Speaking through a Polish interpreter he said: ‘She shouted and sometimes would shake him. For example, when Daniel put his clothes on he would put them on inside out and confused his shoes. ‘Sometimes she wouldn't say anything and put them on for him herself - sometimes there was some shoving or shouting.’ Krezolek said of Daniel: ‘You know, normally like every child, he was a cheeky boy - but he was completely normal.’ He then spoke of how little Daniel, - who spoke no English and only a few words of Polish - preferred to play on his own when they would go to the park. He added: ‘Daniel usually would stay on the side, he enjoyed playing on his own. He didn't contact other kids, he didn't talk to them. ‘Often, in the park a child approached him and showed willingness to play with him, but Daniel showed no such interest.’ Hearing: Mariusz Krezolek (centre) gives evidence at Birmingham Crown Court today through a Polish interpreter (far left). Magdelena Luczak, 27 is also drawn (bottom right) Defence barrister Nigel Lambert QC went on to question Krezolek about his relationship with Daniel's mother. Krezolek told the court Luczak was a 'wonderful woman' at first. He said: ‘We started to see each other on a daily basis. It was very good, every day I came back from work, home to her, and on New Year's Day she told me she was pregnant.’ 'She (Magdalena Luczak) shouted and sometimes would shake him. For example, when Daniel put his clothes on he would put them on inside out and confused his shoes' Mariusz Krezolek . However within a few months he found out his new partner had been lying about the pregnancy to trick him to move in, jurors were told. He added: ‘Most of the time she was a wonderful woman but sometimes out of the blue she would explode and cause arguments. ‘At the very beginning it started with the computer, I couldn't stay in touch - or maybe she didn't wish I did - with a female friend in Poland. ‘She would not wish me to speak to anyone, then the phone number erasing started. ‘I used to have many number of friends in . the UK and after three months they'd gone. Later she admitted she . deleted them when I was asleep so I wouldn't get a temptation to call . anyone. Daniel Pelka's teachers said the schoolboy looked emaciated in the weeks leading up to his death . ‘There was a sick jealousy that came - it is hard to explain.’ The jury also heard how the couple regularly argued. He claimed Luczak would 'smash computers' and that 'four or five' computers were broken in total. 'Most of the time she was a wonderful woman but sometimes out of the blue she would explode and cause arguments' Mariusz Krezolek . He also claimed how the couple were forced to move from a property after her cannabis habit became more frequent and she made friends with a neighbour, who was also a drug dealer. Luczak called police on numerous occasions claiming she had been assaulted by her partner, which he denied. The court heard how Krezolek left Poland in 2005 to come to the UK and was employed at a bricklayer and plasterer within three days. After arriving, he met a woman whom he married, although later found out she was having an affair. He said: ‘I focused on work, I took an extra job and this is how I pushed her into another man's arms. I came back earlier one day from work and I saw them together in bed.’ The trial continues.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:52 EST, 4 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:21 EST, 5 August 2013 . Health and Safety in the workplace began with an illustrated magazine for workers on the railways 100 years ago this month, according to a historian. The magazine paved the way for today's health and safety laws, said Dr Mike Esbester, of the University of Portsmouth. The feature attempts to inform workers for Great Western Railway of the dangers they face in August 1913. Modern attempts to inform workers of the dangers they could face at work began with this illustrated magazine published in 1913 . The railway workers were reminded to carry out their work as safely as possible, whether crossing the railway line, wearing goggles to protect their eyes or loading and unloading goods. Having studied the evolution of health and safety messages over a century, Dr Esbester says that the country has seen enormous changes in the way we have been 'taught, cajoled, encouraged and warned' by the authorities to safeguard ourselves. He said: 'Before 1913, safety warnings to workers were very top-down and text heavy. 'August 1913 saw an entirely different tone and style, it was a massive change. The railway workers were reminded to carry out their work as safely as possible, whether crossing the railway line, wearing goggles to protect their eyes or loading and unloading goods . 'It spoke ""man-to-man"", using an informal, conversational tone and showed people how to be safe rather than just telling them what to do.' He said that initially the focus was on workplace safety, but from 1916 road safety was an increasing concern. In the 1920s thousands of people were being killed on the roads each year, and tens of thousands injured. Reducing the toll of mass motorised transport became a pressing issue. Health and safety moved into the home in the 1930s in response to more people dying and being injured in incidents at home than on the roads or at work. Dr Mike Esbester discovered the magazine which informed workers at Great Western Railway how to be safe in their jobs . Common causes of death or injury in the home were burns, trips, falls and drowning. Over the past 100 years health and safety messages have appeared on a wide selection of items, from children's handkerchiefs, beer mats, milk bottle tops, cigarette cards - which were highly coveted and collectable - and Christmas wrapping paper, to the more commonly known films, posters, leaflets and booklets. Dr Esbester became an expert in the subject after he came across the Great Western Railway feature whilst researching railway history. It included a single black and white photograph of multiple pairs of goggles which had been smashed while protecting their wearers' eyes from flying shards of metal. Similar illustrated articles were carried in the following months. He said: 'I'd never seen anything like it before, and wondered what made this a turning point - why then and there? 'It turned out the magazine feature was a response to the threat of new laws. 'The railway companies didn't want the state to tell them what to do. They were famously opposed to any new government powers, so they were trying to head off more regulation by introducing changes themselves. 'Their message was ""it's up to you, as the worker, to look after yourself"".'","The feature attempts to inform workers at Great Western Railway of the dangers they face in August 1913 .

In addition to her role as the sharp-tongued and imperious Dowager Countess of Grantham which has turned Downton Abbey into a global success, Dame Maggie Smith has also recently starred in two films: last spring’s The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel which was a surprise hit and new film Quartet. And at the age of 78, Dame Maggie has admitted she has no intention of slowing down. Rather she looks forward to ‘whatever other old biddy comes along’ because working fills the loneliness that engulfs her life. Candid: In a rare interview, Dame Maggie Smith says that acting 'fills a void in her life' In a rare interview with 60 Minutes in the US, Dame Maggie reveals that losing the love of her life, the playwright Beverley Cross, has left a void that she fills by immersing herself in a role. Asked: ‘Is it lonely?’ She replied: ‘I don’t know. It seems a bit pointless. Going on one’s own and not having someone to share it with.’ Warming to the theme of aging she also said she didn’t like it and added: ‘I don’t know who does. Noel Coward-- and I don’t mean to name drop. 'But he said,”The awful thing about getting old is that you have breakfast every half-hour.” And that’s sort of what it is. I can’t understand why everything has to go so fast. ‘ . Interviewer Steve Kroft asks her: ‘But you have no interest in finding someone else?’ Dame Maggie replies: ‘Absolutely not. I – no way’. The actress has enjoyed a 60-year career despite early advice from her grandmother that she wasn’t pretty enough to be an actress and that she should learn to type. She made her Broadway debut at 21 and was later recruited by Sir Laurence Olivier to join Britain’s National Theatre. She made her name in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie which won her an Academy Award for best actress. Dame Maggie has won two Oscars, three Emmys and a Tony award in total. Star turn: Dame Maggie Smith starring in Downton Abbey . Her personal life has been just as eventful. Dame Maggie, who was married to Cross for 23 years until his death from heart disease in 1998, initially met him when she was 18. Despite already being married, he proposed to her and she agreed to wait. However, it was while waiting for his divorce to go through that she met Robert Stephens. She went on to have two sons with Stephens, actors Chris Larkin, 45 and Toby Stephens, 43. However, they split in 1973 after seven years of marriage and she married Beverley two years later. Dame Maggie admits she enjoys spending time with her grandchildren and describes them as ‘wonderful’. It was several years ago that the veteran star also admitted she was still struggling to come to terms with her husband’s death, saying: ‘Everybody says it gets better, but I don’t think it does. It gets different. The Dame is pictured with actress Pauline Collins in the 2012 film Quartet . ‘Jane Birkin’s mother Judy Campbell once said an extraordinary thing to me when her husband died; that it was a strange feeling you were not number one with anybody. ‘I have many good friends but I tend to keep to myself anyway. It’s odd, doing things and having no one to share them with.’ A breast cancer survivor, off-screen Dame Maggie admits she likes to use the f-word and accepts that she is spiky because she has high standards.

Paedophiles could find it easier to prey on teenagers online after Facebook changed its rules to allow under-18s to share pictures with anyone on the internet. Until now, all Facebook users aged between 13 and 17 have been barred from making their posts visible to all users. They have been restricted to those they had already decided to link with on the social networking site and were allowed to share posts only with ‘friends of friends’. But, following what it claims are demands from teenagers themselves, that protection has been removed and Facebook will allow children to share their images and videos with the entire public. 'Disaster': Campaigners have condemned the move by Facebook. They say it will lead to pictures of teens ending up in the wrong hands. Picture posed by a model . The move has been condemned as a ‘disaster’ by campaigners, who warn that explicit self-portraits taken by youngsters could fall into the wrong hands. The change brings Facebook in line with other social networks such as Twitter, which allows all users to post publicly. Another change means teenage users will be given a default setting of ‘friends only’ – meaning that to post publicly they will have to change the setting themselves. Technically, Facebook is open only to those aged 13 and above, but in fact thousands of children younger than that have become members of the site by lying about their age. Facebook does not carry out  an age verification check. It  means that thousands of children under 13 could also be at risk of seeing their photos fall into the hands of paedophiles. Helen Goodman, Labour’s media spokesman, said Facebook’s change of policy would be a ‘disaster’ for teenagers. ‘This is a very foolish development,’ she said. ‘Many young people do not understand that photographs which can be put into the public domain can be taken and used by paedophiles. ‘And we know from experience that young people are groomed and bullied on social media, sometimes with tragic consequences. I’m just appalled about this and I really do urge Facebook to think again before we have any more tragic episodes.’ Claire Lilley, of the NSPCC, said the charity was pleased that Facebook has made ‘friends only’ the default setting for 13- to 17-year-olds, but she attacked the decision to allow them to share posts publicly. No age check: Facebook doesn't carry out an age verification check . ‘It’s simply not acceptable for Facebook to expect children to take 100 per cent responsibility for managing not just their settings but their levels of risk too; teenagers aren’t always going to be careful about what they post,’ she said. Earlier this week, the Mail revealed that tens of thousands of explicit pictures shared by teenagers are stolen and end up on websites viewed by paedophiles. A search of only 40 hours by analysts at the Internet Watch Foundation, which takes down child abuse images, found more than 12,200 self-generated pictures and videos of teens on paedophile websites. A survey by the charity ChildLine has found that more than half of teens have been pressurised into sharing intimate photos, either via their mobiles or on sites such as Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat. Simon Milner, director of policy for Facebook in the UK, said: ‘One of the requests we hear direct from teenagers most often is the ability to share things in a public way, just as they can on other services. ‘Teens are among the savviest people using social media, and they want to be heard.’ He said the changes were designed to ‘improve the experience’ for teenagers. ‘They’re expert at controlling who can see what they say and do on Facebook,’ he said. As a protective measure, Facebook will warn minors opting to be more open that they are exposing themselves to a wider audience. This will repeat before every post, while the settings remain on ‘public’. Kathryn Montgomery, professor of communications at the American University in Washington, criticised what she described as a money-making move by Facebook. She said that allowing teenagers to share more about themselves will enable advertisers to collect more personal data about them. Facebook denied the move would enable it to make more money.","Until now 13 to 17-year olds barred from making posts visible to all users .

Mrs Ruckinger, who had been estranged from her family for years, rang the doorbell at her her family home and ambushed her mother Roberta Frew, 64.

Ruckinger was shot dead in the head. Mr Frew was not injured and called 911 when the shooting stopped. Upon their arrival, police found Mrs Ruckinger still alive but with a gunshot wound in the head. She was rushed to Altoona UPMC Trauma Center where she was later pronounced dead. Toxicology tests have yet to be completed on the deceased.

Krokodil, the deadly skin-rotting drug that originated in Russia, may have hit the New York club scene. Following reports over the past month of cases of krokodil abuse in both Arizona and Chicago, Illinois, the drug is now believed to have hit New York. A source has claimed that the drug is being sold in at least two nightclubs in New York City’s hip Meatpacking District. Krokodil fears: Unconfirmed reports suggest that the drug has spread to New York City after previously being reported in Illinois and Arizona . The Verge reports that Sal Ramirez, who witnessed the effects of krokodil while serving in the Peace Corps in Kazakhstan, saw a man being throw out of Le Bain for selling the drug, and was approached by a deal at Westway, who reportedly tried to sell him krokodil and clean syringes in the bathroom. Krokodil, whose medical name is . desomorphine, has been called a 'moonshine drug' because addicts are . often able to cook the narcotic at home. Mixing the substance can leave . traces of toxins in the final product which addicts then inject. The drug is made of readily available ingredients such as . codeine, iodine and toxins such as gasoline, industrial cleaning oil, . lighter fluid and paint thinner. Users filter and boil ingredients . together, then inject the drug. An opioid eight to 10 times stronger than morphine, krokodil is so-called because it leave addicts with scaly green skin near the injection site. The high lasts only a couple of hours, but the drug is significantly cheaper than heroin. Fears that the drug could head to the . United States have been rife since 2011, when a Drug Enforcement . Administration official said the agency was aware of its use overseas. But . even with a drug treatment physician publicly announcing medics have . now treated four users within the U.S., the DEA has said it is not ready . to recognize it as an immediate threat. This man's ankle (left) shows symptoms of gangrene and another individual's fingers are rotting away (both cases are from Russia). Doctors fear an epidemic of the cheap heroin substitute in the U.S. Agency spokeswoman Dawn Dearden told FoxNews.com: . 'We, the DEA, are not seeing cases of it. Nothing’s been turned into . any of our labs. As far as the DEA is concerned, we have not seen any . cases.' The announcement comes after a worrying wave of some victims injecting themselves with krokodil because they think it is heroin, doctors said. The first instances of its use in the U.S. were recorded in Arizona last month. It is already widely used in Russia. Three cases have now been reported in Chicago and doctors say two of . the women did not even know they had been sold the drug. The victims were all aged between 18 and 25 and come from middle-class backgrounds. Pictures and videos of users in . Russia show blackened fingertips, large open wounds, and even exposed . bone where skin has fallen off. Prolonged or even short-term use can damage blood vessels, muscle, cartilage, and bone, and amputation is frequently the . only way to save a patient’s life. Doctors . have warned of the horrifying side effects of the homemade drug, which . is said to give a more powerful high than heroin. The . flesh rotting that is specific to the drug occurs directly at the . injection site, often leaving users with wounds to their feet or arms. Dr . Abhin Singla said he instantly recognized the smell of rotting flesh at . Presence St Joseph Medical Center in Chicago and realized krokodil use . had arrived in the city. Dr . Singla, the hospital's director of addiction services, told Joliet.Patch he was surprised at how quickly krokodil use had spread from . Arizona. He said: 'If you want to kill yourself, this is the way to do it.' Rabid use of the drug in Russia has caused up to 2.5 million people to register and seek treatment as addicts. The average life span for a user is only two to three years. 'When drug users do it repeatedly, the skin sloughs. It causes hardening of their skin. It will cause necrosis,' explained Dr Frank LoVecchio. Dr. Frank LoVecchio at Banner's Poison Control Center says he believes the two cases found in Arizona to be the start of a problem in the United States . He added two patients had arrived at hospital asking for help to . wean themselves off heroin without realizing they had actually been . injecting themselves with krokodil. Dr Singla said he hoped warnings about the drug would spread through word of mouth among . addicts. He told the website: 'The goriness of the pictures of rotting arms . and legs are hard to look at, but I think parents really need to share . them with their kids.' Krokodil's, medical name is desomorphine and is created by mixing codeine with gasoline, paint thinner, hydrochloric acid, iodine and red phosphorous.There are reportedly nearly three million users in Russia and the epidemic began in Siberia and the Russian Far East.The drug causes flesh to rot from the inside out and the addict's skin becomes scaly, like a crocodile's, hence the name. Blood vessels burst and the surrounding tissue dies. Gangrene and amputations are a common result and sometimes bone can be exposed.The drug high lasts around an hour and a half. It is three times cheaper to produce than heroin. Last month, Banner's Poison Control Center in Arizona . encountered the drug when two addicts arrived in emergency rooms with . their flesh hanging off their body, exposing bone. 'We've . had two cases this past week that have occurred in Arizona,' said Dr LoVecchio, the co-medical director at Banner's Poison Control . Center to KPHO.Com. 'As . far as I know, these are the first cases in the United States that are . reported. So we're extremely frightened,' he continued. Dr LoVechhio . said the two cases he encountered are most likely linked and . he declined to comment on the appearance of the two users. 'Where there is smoke there is fire, and we're afraid there are going to be more and more cases,' he said. Some addicts in Russia have developed brain damage and speech impediments in addition to the horrific scars. Prevalent in Siberia and the Russian Far East, the explosion of users first began in 2002. The numbers of Russians using the drug is thought to have trebled over the past five years. In 2011 alone, Russia's Federal Drug Control Service confiscated 65 million doses.","Krokodil is reported to have been sold at trendy Meatpacking District clubs .

Diplomats in Libya knew the assault on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was a terrorist attack 'from the get-go,' the number-two American official in the country will testify this week. The revelation by Gregory Hicks, the deputy chief of mission in Libya, shows that the Obama Administration knew the the September 11, 2012 attack was not the result of a popular protest over an anti-Islamic YouTube video - as the American public was initially told. Hicks is one of three State Department 'whistle blowers' expected to appear in front of the House Oversight Committee Wednesday to give evidence of a 'coverup' by the Obama administration over its response to the attack that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. The combined testimony is likely to . re-ignite criticism of the Obama . Administration's handling of the run-up to the Benghazi attacks and its . handling of the aftermath. Witness: Gregory N. Hicks, a veteran officer of the Foreign Service - was in Tripoli on the night of the attack when he received a distress call from Ambassador Stevens . Tragic: The September 11, 2012, assault on the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi resulted in the deaths of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. 'Cover-up': Congressman Darrell Issa, the Republican in charge of the Benghazi attack hearings, says the testimony from the whistle blowers could reveal an Obama Administration 'cover-up' 'I thought it was a terrorist attack from the get-go. I think everybody in the mission thought it was a terrorist attack from the beginning,' Hicks said, according to excerpts of interviews released to CBS' Face the Nation. Hicks, a 22-year veteran of the foreign service, says he was furious when U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice appeared on TV five days after the attack and declared that U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans died as part of an anti-American 'demonstration' by Libyans. 'I've never been as embarrassed in my life, in my career, as on that day,' he told Congressional interviewers. He added: 'I never reported a demonstration. I reported an attack on the consulate. Chris's last report - if you want to say his final report - is, ""Greg, we are under attack.""' Utah Congressman Jason Chaffetz, a . Republican and members of the House committee, said told Fox News that Hicks was in Tripoli on the night of . the attack when he received a distress call from Ambassador Stevens. Eric Nordstrom, who was the regional security officer in Libya, also testified on Capitol Hill on October 10 . Mourned: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Foreign Service Officer Sean Smith were both killed inside the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya . Defenders: Glen Doherty, left, and Tyrone Woods, right, were former Navy seamen who responded to the call for help from the consulate and were killed in a counter-attack by the terrorists . 'We're under attacks! We're under attacks' Stevens reportedly yelled into his cell phone. According . to the Utah congressman, Hicks reacted to the news by calling . Washington to alert officials and set off an 'inter-agency response.' Another witness of the attacks, Mark I. Thompson, a U.S. Marine veteran and a State Department counter-terrorism adviser, plans to testify that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to leave her department's own counter-terrorism bureau out of . the loop as government in the hours after the attacks as officials figured out how to respond to the attacks. The third witness is Eric Nordstrom, a former State Department diplomatic security officer in charge of regional security in Libya. Allegation: One of the Benghazi 'whistle-blowers' will reportedly claim on Wednesday that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to silence the State Department's own counterterrorism bureau . 'Clearly, there was a political decision to say something different than what was reasonable to say,' House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa told Face the Nation. He said State Department and White House officials launched 'what is a misinformation campaign, at best, and a cover-up at worst.' Two major targets of the Republican-controlled investigation are Clinton and Under Secretary for Management Patrick Kennedy. Spokespeople for both the state department and Clinton denied the allegations. For Nordstrom, the upcoming hearing would not be the first time that he was called to testify on the events of last September. 'For . me the Taliban is on the inside of the [State Department] building,' the former mission deputy chief angrily said while speaking at a hearing . chaired by California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa in October 2012. Co-worker: The claims will reportedly also finger Under Secretary for Management Patrick Kennedy . During . his testimony at the time, Nordstrom detailed for lawmakers how he and . the late ambassador had repeatedly asked to increase security at the . embassy in the months leading up to the attack, but said that their . pleas fell on deaf ears as the situation in the country continued . deteriorating. The two other State Department officials have never publicly spoken about the attacks. Hicks and Thompson are believed to be . represented pro bono by Joe diGenova, a former US attorney, and his . wife, Victoria Toensing, a former chief counsel of the Senate . Intelligence Committee. Of the three men, Nordstrom is the only one who does not consider himself a whistle-blower. According . to diGenova and Toensing, their clients' accounts of the attacks in .

'People here have nothing for their children. I am on strike because I want to help save food for others.' Hunger: A boy eats maize as people shop ahead of the Muslim festival of Eid-al-Adha in Aleppo . Rubble: A girl pushes plastic containers of water past rubble and damaged buildings in Homs . Hard life: Children play with plastic guns in Aleppo . In some areas children have died from severe malnutrition, according to one NGO. For . Muslims, Eid is a time for children to receive new clothes and play . with friends after sharing a festive meal with their families. But in a string of rebel-held areas under a months-long army siege south and east of Damascus, activists say food has all but run out and doctors lack the means to treat their patients. 'Of course there is no Eid for the children here' in Moadamiyet al-Sham, a suburb southwest of Damascus, said activist Abu Malek. 'For them, Eid will come when they see a plate of rice and bulgur,' he added, speaking to AFP via the Internet. Residents of Moadamiyet al-Sham are surviving on herbs and vegetables they have planted. Shelling: A Syrian girl blows a balloon beside ruins her family fled to in fear of shelling in Jabal Al-Zawiya near Idlib . Supplies: In a string of rebel-held areas under a months-long army siege south and east of Damascus, activists say food has all but run out and doctors lack the means to treat their patients . 'We no longer have any food in the stockpiles. Everyone is planting in the orchards and the streets,' said activist Abu Hadi, adding that no bread had entered the area for months. But harvesting the food is dangerous, 'and people have died in the orchards because of the shelling', he said. Rami Abdel Rahman, director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said many children in Moadamiyet al-Sham were malnourished. 'Children are worst off because they need the right kinds of food in order to grow. Adults can survive on whatever they can find, but what about the children?' The army says 'terrorists,' its term for the rebels, have trapped civilians against their will. But activists accuse the military of using the siege to try to turn people against the rebels. 'It is a war crime to besiege civilians,' Abdel Rahman said. Shocking amateur videos have been distributed by activists from the town, showing visibly malnourished children. Free Syrian Army fighters gathered inside a cave in Maaret al-Naaman village, in Idlib . A Free Syrian Army fighter prepares ammunition inside a cave .

Another video shows a girl with her two baby siblings, appealing for help so her family can secure baby milk. 'There is no road... The road is closed... What are we going to do?... We are feeding them milk but it's expired,' says the little girl, as the babies cry. For some, relief came earlier this week, when the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Syrian Red Crescent evacuated 3,500 people from Moadimayet al-Sham with the agreement of the authorities. But only children, women and old men were able to leave, with the wounded left behind and aid workers prevented from entering the area.

Civilians and firefighters try to put out a fire at the roof of a building which activists said was shelled by forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, in Raqqa, eastern Syria . 'There are many more, including children, who remain in the town,' said Magne Barth, head of the ICRC delegation in Syria. The situation is just as bad for children in other rebel-held areas near Damascus. 'On any given day in the emergency room, some four out of 10 patients I see are malnourished children,' said Abu Mohammad, a doctor working in a field clinic in the Marj area east of the capital. 'Many children have very low blood pressure, fatigue, dizziness, and a reduced (disease-fighting) white blood cell count. The worst affected by the food shortages are children aged under two years,' he added. The hardest part is not having the right medical equipment or food to fight malnutrition, he told AFP. 'I get depressed in the clinic, because we don't have what we need to fight this.' Also affected is Yarmuk, a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Damascus that has turned into a battleground in recent months. 'Nothing, not even bread or flour has been allowed in for 96 days,' according to Palestinian-Syrian activist Ali Abu Khaled, who said he is 'lucky to get one small meal a day.'","Muslims around the world are marking the Eid al-Adha holiday .

The supermarket giant says they have seen a big increase in the sales of exotic fruits. Mango have risen by 40 per cent compared to last year, while pomegranates are up 30 per cent and persimmons are up 60 per cent. Also known as grenadilla, passion fruit is native to South America and was first introduced to the UK in the 19th century. Usually the size of an egg, the crunchy, slightly sour seeds inside are often used in desserts or salads, but the Kenyan variety, because of its sweeter seeds, can be eaten straight away. The Kenyan passion fruit is grown by smallholder farmers with funding from the Department for International Development and it is hoped exports of the fruit will help boost local economies in rural Kenya. The fruit is twice the size of its purple relative (pictured), and tastes much sweeter . International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: These new fruits are an excellent example of how leading British companies are joining the fight against global poverty. They taste pretty good too.  Making sure Kenyan farmers can sell their goods will create new jobs, boost incomes and ultimately help end their dependency on aid.’ A pack of two passion fruits costs £1 and is currently available in 69 stores, with plans to roll out to 113 later on. Gemma Barlow, from Asda’s Fresh Produce team said: ‘We’re constantly looking for new and exciting products to bring into Asda and the ‘sunshine’ passion fruit brings a ray of sun to the family fruit bowl this autumn, and is sure to be a hit with exotic fruit fans.’","'Sunshine passion fruit' is named for its bright yellow skin .

A stream of brightly-coloured butterflies have been spotted smothering the heads of turtles as they try and drink their tears. The strange sight occurs because the orange Julia butterflies and yellow Sulphur butterflies require the nutritional benefits of salt. Being a long way from any source of sodium in the Amazon rainforest, the butterflies take advantage of the turtles' salt-rich tears and surround their heads looking for a drink. Scroll down for video . Eying up their target: A stream of butterflies cover a turtle's head in the Amazon jungle as they try to drink its tears to ingest much-needed sodium . Travel photographer Jeff Cremer and . biologist Phil Torres worked together in Tambopata, Peru to capture the . sight and said they had never seen so many butterflies gather at once. Mr Cremer, 35, from Pueblo, Colorado, said: 'We thought it was hilarious. 'We're used to one or two butterflies on a turtle but these ones seem to be absolutely smothered in butterflies. 'I would say there were about 15 turtles in all up and down the river but there were loads of butterflies.'

According . to Mr Torres, a 27-year-old PhD student in ecology and evolutionary . biology at Rice University in Houston, Texas, the still turtles are an . easy target for the feeding behaviour, which is known as mud-puddling. Cooperative animals: The turtles seem unperturbed by the intrusion into their personal space and are apparently very patient with the gentle touch of butterflies. However, they are not as placid when bees try to drink their tears . Sweaty benefits: Much like humans, a turtle's sweat is rich in salt and orange Julia butterflies and yellow Sulphur butterflies rely on the unusual source for their sodium . He said: 'As you go further from the Atlantic Ocean, the general availability of salt decreases in the environment because there is less of it in the rain. 'So, in the western Amazon region far from the Atlantic, odd behaviours pop up to account for this, including drinking the tears of turtles and caiman. 'The butterflies tend to attract each other, so if one butterfly is feeding, its bright colors invite other butterflies to that site to feed as well.' Some experts believe that the insects cleanse the turtles' eyes in return for the drink, but Mr Torres said 'I don't believe that's very likely' Amazingly, the turtles are apparently unperturbed by the intrusion into their personal space and are apparently very patient with the gentle touch of butterflies. However, they are not as placid when bees also come to drink turtle tears for sodium. Mr Torres said: 'When bees come by to drink from the turtles' tears, they appear to get agitated and will dodge their head around and try and swat the bee away. 'I imagine the butterflies are a bit gentler and have narrower mouth parts that the turtles seem okay with. Snap happy: Travel photographer Jeff Cremer and biologist Phil Torres worked together in Tambopata, Peru to capture the sight and said they had never seen so many butterflies gather at once . Some experts believe that the insects cleanse the turtles' eyes in return for the drink, but Mr Torres said 'I don't believe that's very likely.' 'More likely is that this relationship is a form of commensalism, in which the butterfly benefits from the turtle and the turtle isn't really affected either way. 'Butterflies in this area will do anything for salt, including drinking from your sweaty skin or backpack,' he said. 'I bet that if you laid out with your skin covered and your eyes open, you may eventually have a swarm of colorful butterflies imbibing on your tears, too.' Special relationship?

Britain could pull out of the controversial European Convention on Human Rights which stops dangerous terrorists from being ‘chucked out’ of the UK, David Cameron said today. For the first time the Prime Minister revealed he was ready to end the right of foreign courts to interfere with British justice. He said cutting ties with the Strasbroug courts could be the only way to ensure a future Conservative government can keep the people of Britain safe. Threat: David Cameron said he would do whatever it takes to keep Britain safe, including leaving the European Convention on Human Rights. He is pictured on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show with US band Haim . Controversial: Britain may pull away from the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg . Schools, courthouses and immigration centres should be free to ban religious veils, David Cameron said. The Prime Minister said he did not believe there should be a general ban on wearing the niqab - which conceals the whole face - in the streets. But he made clear he was 'happy' to look at the issue of whether the state needed to do more to back up institutions which choose to implement a ban. Mr Cameron told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: 'We are a free country and people should be free to wear whatever clothes they like in public or in private. 'But we should support those institutions that need to put in place rules so that those institutions can work properly. 'So for instance in a school, if they want that particular dress code, I believe the Government should back them. The same for courts, the same for immigration. 'I think we should back those institutions that want to have sensible policies that actually have a particular purpose.' The European Convention has been . responsible for deeply controversial decisions including repeatedly . blocking the deportation of radical cleric Abu Qatada and insisting . offenders in British prisons should have the right to vote. Home . Secretary Theresa May and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling have both . argued that leaving the ECHR is the only way to give Britain control of . its laws, without dangerous criminals and terrorists being able to . appeal to European courts. Mr Cameron said the UK could start by scrapping the Human Rights Act, and replacing it with a Bill of Rights. But . he suggested he was now ready to go further. Asked if he backed Tory . MPs who want the Britain to leave the ECHR, Mr Cameron replied: ‘It may . be that that is where we end up.’ The . Prime Minister said he wanted to ‘think about what is the outcome we . want’ rather than focus on conventions the UK remains signed up to. He told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘As Prime Minister I want to know can I keep our country  safe. ‘So for instance are we able to chuck out of our country people who have no right to be here, who threaten our country, I say we should be able to do that. ‘Now, whatever that takes we must deliver that outcome. That’s what I think we have the next 20 months to do and put into our manifesto whatever measures need to be taken so we can get the effect we want which is basically to have greater ability to keep our people safe. ‘There are a range of options. You can write a British Bill of Rights so that when cases go to the European Convention on Human Rights you have a proper margin appreciation. ‘The judges there can say well the British have got their own Bill of Rights, they have made they own decision and we should respect that. ‘That is one possibility. But we have some time now to get this right before the manifesto.’ ‘But people should be in no doubt that under a Conservative-only government led by me, there will be the ability to throw out of this country far more rapidly people  who threaten us and our way of life.’ Block: The ECHR repeatedly blocked attempts by the UK government to deport hate cleric Abu Qatada . Out: Home Secretary Theresa May finally succeeded in deporting Abu Qatada in July after a decade-long legal battle . The ECHR was set up after the Second World War to prevent torture and human rights abuses. The court was established in 1959, giving complainants direct access to justice at a European level. But critics say the court has grown out of all proportion, and its judges do not even need to have any judicial experience in their homeland. In theory, the Council of Europe, a body with 47 member states which oversees the Strasbourg court, could retaliate against Mrs May by expelling Britain. But this has not happened to other countries found guilty of flouting human rights laws in the past. Opposition to the ECHR in Britain has been fuelled by a series of high-profile cases. The court wants to see tens of thousands of prisoners, including murderers and rapists, being given the vote, regardless of the offence that they have committed. Its ruling, in defiance of a 100-year ban on votes for prisoners in the UK, came after the ECHR backed a complaint by John Hirst, a convicted axe killer. David Cameron has denied claims that he regretted his decision to put same-sex marriage into law. A new book about the coalition government has suggested that Mr Cameron had told allies he would not have gone ahead with the reform if he had known how fierce opposition would be from Conservative MPs. The Prime Minister admitted he was surprised by the level of anger provoked in his own party's ranks by gay marriage, but insisted he was glad to have introduced the change. Furore: David Cameron admitted he did not predict the public backlash against his plans for same-sex marriages . Mr Cameron was speaking after the publication in the Sunday Telegraph of an excerpt from Matthew d'Ancona's book In It Together, suggesting that Mr Cameron told an ally: 'If I'd known what it was going to be like, I wouldn't have done it.' The PM told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: 'I don't regret it. Britain is a more equal and fairer country for having done it. 'It's certainly true to say that this is an important change. I don't think I expected quite the furore that there was. It's clearly been very difficult for some people to take on, and I completely understand and respect that. 'I'm not sure perhaps at the beginning we got across to people that this was about marriages that could take place in registry offices, that this was not going to change what happened in church, mosques or synagogues.' He added: 'I am passionate about marriage. I think it's a great institution, and I think it should be available to people who are gay as well as those of us who aren't.'","Prime Minister reveals frustrations at interference from foreign courts .

Mothers are being advised against buying milk from websites after a study found three quarters of samples from one site contained harmful levels of bacteria (file picture) Human breast milk being sold online contains dangerous levels of bacteria including potentially-deadly salmonella. Three quarters of samples taken from one popular website were found to contain harmful levels of bacteria. Several babies have already been made ill by drinking contaminated milk, according to the study by the Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. While human milk is also provided through milk banks to hospitals, their donors are carefully screened and all the milk is pasturised to remove harmful germs. Sarah Keim, the lead author and a researcher said that with Internet sites, 'you have very few ways to know for sure what you are getting is really breast milk and that it's safe to feed your baby.' 'Because the consequences can be serious, it is not a good idea to obtain breast milk in this way.' The study tested 101 samples from one popular site, which they didn't name. Seventy-four percent of the samples either had disease-causing bacteria like E. coli or harmful levels of bacteria such as Streptococci. As a control 20 samples from a milk bank were tested, and seven tested positive for containing disease-causing bacteria. Dr. Kenneth Boyer, pediatrics chief at Rush University Medical Center in . Chicago, who was not involved in the study, called the results 'pretty . scary' adding: 'Just imagine if the donor happens to be a drug user. You . don't know.' The study does not say where the bacteria comes from, but possible sources include donors' skin, breast pumps used to extract milk, or contamination from improper shipping methods. While researchers admit that all milk will contain some bacteria which is essential for building up babies' immune systems, these were not the bacteria they looked at. Salmonella microbes, also found on raw chicken and in animal feces, cause diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps and in extreme cases can lead to death from dehydration. Mothers' excess milk is sold online through various sites for between $1 and $2 an ounce (file picture) Babies are among the most vulnerable as their immune systems have yet to properly develop. Administrators of one site that facilitates the sale of milk, www.onlythebreast.com, said that they recognize the problem and are trying to address it. A statement read: 'We have made the decision to transition away from offering breast milk classified ads and in the near future completely remove them with the goal (of stopping) all...activities related to informal milk sharing.' 'We will be shifting our focus from mother to mother internet sales to helping qualified Only the Breast donors provide milk to a new milk banking program.' The company says it will screen its donors and process their milk in partnership with Medolac Laboratories. Supporters of milk-sharing also say that a line needs to be drawn between donors, who give away their milk for free and have nothing to gain from lying about their health, and sellers. Breanna Clemons of Dickinson, N.D., is a donor who found a local woman who needed breast milk through one of the online sites where milk is offered free. 'A lot of people are like, ""Ewww, it's weird,"" but they haven't been in a situation where they didn't want their child to have formula,' or couldn't produce enough milk, Clemons said. She said she shared her medical history with the recipient. Clemons is breast-feeding her 7-month-old and stores excess milk in her freezer. Every few weeks, she meets up with the recipient and gives her about 20 6-ounce bags. Clemons said the woman has a healthy 9-month-old who 'loves my milk.' The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends against feeding babies milk bought over the Internet, but doesn't regulate its sale.","Nationwide Children's Hospital, in Ohio, carried out study .

The controversial ‘Go home or face arrest’ poster vans targeted at illegal immigrants are to be axed because they have been ineffective. Sources close to Home Secretary Theresa May said she had examined the evidence for continuing the Government’s billboard campaign which resulted in the voluntary repatriation of just one person. The campaign has been piloted in six London boroughs featuring leaflets and posters with the message: ‘In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest.’ Axed: Billboards carrying a warning of 'Go Home or Face Arrest' to reduce illegal immigration this summer . Two vans were driven around displaying the slogan and advertising a telephone helpline offering support and advice to illegal migrants who want to leave the UK. The campaign proved hugely controversial. Liberal Democrat ministers called for it to be scrapped, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper accused the Tories of using the ‘language of the National Front’ and it even attracted criticism from the Right-wing UK Independence Party. But polls showed almost 80 per cent of the public backed the message, and it has been robustly defended by Conservative immigration minister Mark Harper. Only last week, he told the BBC’s Question Time that the campaign could be rolled out across the country. ‘I don’t see any problem with saying to people who have no right to be in the United Kingdom they can’t be here any more,’ he said. Rethink: Sources close to Home Secretary Theresa May claim she has assessed the poor results of the vans . But sources close to Mrs May said that after examining an internal report on the impact of the scheme, she has determined that it will not be extended. ‘She doesn’t think there was anything wrong with the principle of the scheme but it is clear it has not been effective,’ said one source. Earlier this month, Mr Harper told MPs that just one Pakistani man had been persuaded to leave the country as a result of the campaign over the summer. He had not seen one of the vans, but contacted the Home Office after reading about them in the Guardian. The minister insisted the single voluntary repatriation meant the £10,000 campaign had ‘already paid for itself’, since arresting, detaining and deporting an individual typically cost the taxpayer around £15,000. Mark Harper (pictured) signed off the provocative 'Go home or face arrest' billboards that piloted around London . Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper accused the Conversatives of using National Front terminology . The source close to the Home Secretary insisted the Government would press on with a separate campaign of sending warning text messages to suspected illegal immigrants. The Home Office says just 14 people out of a total of 58,800 contacted were mistakenly asked if they had overstayed their visas. Miss Cooper will today attack the Government for ‘resorting to ineffective and offensive ad vans, gimmicks or incorrect text messages to people who have lived here for 30 years’. Labour will table amendments to the coalition’s Immigration Bill which it says would tackle exploitation in the labour market and address problems with border controls and enforcement. The party’s plans include making it illegal for recruitment agencies to target and recruit only foreign workers, or to run shifts only for them. It also proposes to introduce a requirement that every large firm hiring a migrant worker from outside the EU has to offer an apprenticeship in return, although it concedes these would also have to be open to foreigners.","Just one Pakistani man was persuaded to go home by Tory campaign .

Rubbing shoulders: Chris Martin, left, is pictured with TV chef Gordon Ramsay on June 5, just days before he was arrested for having oral sex on a plane on June 21 . 'I have made many mistakes in my life, none greater than this one,' he told the Mail Tribune in a written statement. 'I have lost my job, my reputation and damaged the legacy I had worked 10 years to nurture and grow. I will learn from this and move on to the next chapter in my life.' The pair were initially charged with a federal misdemeanor crime of lewd, indecent and obscene acts on an airplane. That charge carried a maximum sentence of up to 90 days in jail and a $500 fine. Martin complained that he had been persecuted by the press, claiming the media had done 'everything to paint me in nothing but the worst possible light.' He said in the statement that he believes he would have been exonerated if his case had gone to trial but he pleaded guilty to move on with his life. Big mistake: Martin, left, said on Wednesday he had made many mistakes in his life but this was the worst despite being fined just $250 . He also apologized for hurting his friends, family, Troon staff and other passengers. 'My actions were clearly inappropriate and inconsiderate,' Martin wrote. 'Seeing and hearing the level of venom directed at these people has been hardest for me and I am truly sorry for that.' On the winery's Facebook page, Martin can be seen chatting and posing with Ramsay as the pair enjoy a meal together and taste the vineyard's produce. It was reported in August that Martin had been forced to take a leave of absence by his father after the embarrassing sky-high performance. Troon Vineyards announced on its Facebook page that Martin had been replaced pending the court case against him. Martin and Stroble, 33, were arrested on June 21 after getting off an Allegiant Airlines flight from Medford, Oregon to Las Vegas, where they were attending a conference. They engaged in a number of sex acts several different times on the plane while young families were on board. Guilty plea: Chris Martin, 44, right, and Jessica Stroble, 33, . left, were arrested in June after stepping off an Allegiant Airlines flight . from Medford, Oregon . Troon Vineyards: Martin's father Larry Martin wrote in August: 'Former Director of Troon Vineyard Chris Martin has taken an indefinite leave of absence following a complaint filed last week in U.S. District Court' One horrified mother complained to staff: 'This is not the sex education I wanted to give my teenage sons.' The announcement, which was signed by Chris' father Larry Martin said: 'Former Director of Troon Vineyard Chris Martin has taken an indefinite leave of absence following a complaint filed last week in U.S. District Court.' Passengers, including children, looked on in horror as the beauty salon worker allegedly grew increasingly intimate with the exposed Martin before performing oral sex on him shortly after takeoff. Court papers describe in graphic detail how they then engaged in a second sex act mid-way through the 90-minute flight and did not even reign in their passionate . exchange when confronted by airline staff. They did take a break, however, when the mid-flight drink and snack service came down the aisle, but resumed shortly after. This time it was Stroble who exposed herself as the tryst became even more heated. At one point, according to another passenger, Martin appeared to be 'in his own world' as passions grew. Official statement: The notice posted on Facebook to inform customers that Chris Martin was taking an indefinite leave of absence, written by his dad Larry Martin . Martin's attorney, Larry C. Hill, . said passengers on the plane exaggerated events and because there was a person in the aisle seat no one would have been able to have a full view of what was taking place. 'Mr Martin is prejudicially . characterized by the media as a reckless individual, which is contrary . to his long-standing ties and contributions to the southern Oregon . community,' he told Fox5. 'He's already being deemed guilty by the media. There are customers canceling contracts with him. There's orders that are not being renewed.' When . approached by The Smoking Gun in August at the beauty salon where she works, . Stroble claimed she had no idea about the court action. And when asked to comment on the specific allegations, she replied: 'None of that happened.' She . also refused to expand on the nature of her relationship with Martin . other than to confirm that they are not married and that she had no . contact information for him. Shock: 'This is not the sex education I wanted to give my teenage sons': Stroble and Martin were arrested as they stepped off the Allegiant Airlines flight from Medford, Oregon, to Las Vegas after horrified passengers complained to staff . Full account: Documents tendered at the Nevada court go on to describe Martin and Stroble's actions in graphic detail, leaving the judge in no doubt about the nature of their conduct . On Troon's Facebook page, customers have been divided on whether or not to stick with the company. Leah Jolma wrote: 'Why does one have . to have anything else to do with the other? Chris may or may not have . done something. So what? 'Troon wine is delicious. If you need to pass judgement on him so be it. That is just more great wine for me. Thanks.' Ian Shelley said: 'I'm pretty sure that I'm . actually going to buy more Troon wine because of this incident. I'm a . big proponent of sometimes doing things you shouldn't.' Liam Soslowe did not agree and . posted: 'Come on community, take a stand, there are TONS of other local . & incredible wineries, that know how to be professional, take your . business somewhere else till they clean this mess up!' Kristina Smith Stader said: 'The . problem I have is the fact that he is not an employee , he is the owner . of the company. So any dollar I spend there adds to his profits. 'He has a . true lack of respect and consideration for others.  If I knew he would . not profit at all from the business any longer than I would reconsider . doing business there.' Others took the situation lightly . with one guy posting: 'Can I order a bottle of whatever Jessica was . drinking for my girlfriend??'","Christopher Martin, 44, and Jessica Stroble, 33, pleaded guilty in absentia to a federal misdemeanor charge of disorderly conduct on Wednesday .

It may sound like something out of the Matrix but a groundbreaking new invention could transform the way we power our lives by using our bodyheat to generate electricity. Fujifilm has developed a light-weight film that sticks to skin and gathers heat energy emitted from the body which is then converted in to electricity. The device - called a thermoelectric converter - means we may soon be able to charge our smartphones while out and about by simply using our own energy. The development could bring an end to the traditional method of using battery chargers from electrical points to power our phones. Demonstration: Fujifilm has created a high-efficiency Thermoelectric Converter with organic material which can convert heat off the human body in to electricity . And with the aid of solar panels to make the conversion more effective, the generator may also be able to charge larger electrical items such as laptops and eReaders. As well as powering our ever-increasingly high-tech lives, the inventors also hope the device can be worn on the skin by patients to charge their medical devices. The organic polymer material was created by Fujifilms jointly with Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST). It can detect a temperature change from the surrounding environment of just one degree celsius meaning it starts producing electricity the moment it touches the skin. Similar organic products have been created in the past but the new material is far more efficient than any other converter seen before. Breakthrough: Scientists have created an organic polymer material which sticks to the skin and is activated by a temperature change of just one degree celsius . It can also be made in a printing press meaning it can be made to almost virtually any size needed. The material is also flexible so can be wrapped around different body parts. The Fujifilm device was unveiled at the Nanotech 2013 conference in Tokyo where the latest inventions and gadgets are revealed to the world. A live demonstration was given at the show where a person pressed their hand against the material and a toy car began moving around a track. The new conversion material was not the only product the company unveiled - they also showed off new speakers that can be rolled up. Fujifilm will release futher details of the device at the 60th JSAP Spring Meeting 2013, taking place between March 27 to 30,in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.","New device - called a thermoelectric converter - has been created by Fujifilm .

Notorious: 'Cheriegate' conman Peter Foster, 51, has arrived in Fiji on a false passport after going on the run from a three-year jail sentence in Australia (library picture) Notorious ‘Cheriegate’ conman Peter Foster, on the run from a three-year-jail sentence in Australia, has surfaced in Fiji, after arriving in disguise on a false passport. In an audacious attempt to remain out of prison after being sentenced for his continuing involvement in the weight loss industry against a court-ordered ban, the 51-year-old former ‘friend’ of Cherie Blair, is now seeking protection in the Pacific island nation. He has refused to reveal how he managed to escape from Australia, but has admitted travelling in disguise and using a false passport. ‘I’m a stranger again,’ he said. ‘I just feel incredible sadness.’ Foster, who helped Cherie Blair purchase two discounted flats in Bristol in 2002, sparking alarm that she had used a notorious conman, was last week sentenced in his absence to three years imprisonment by a judge in Queensland for breaking an order not to be involved in the slimming industry. He should have arrived in court to hear the judge deliver his punishment, but instead sent a rambling letter in which he said he had got the date wrong and even hinted that he had contemplated suicide because of the hounding he had received from authorities over the years. A warrant was issued for his arrest but until he made contact with an Australian newspaper at the weekend his whereabouts were unknown. He said he now regards Fiji as his version of Ronnie Biggs’ Brazil - a reference to the Great Train Robber who lived in the South American country for years after escaping British justice. Foster told Brisbane’s Sunday Mail that his escape to Fiji - where he had once lived and where he had been formerly arrested for allegedly conning a bank out of a large sum of money - had left him exhausted and ‘sick to the stomach’. He added: ‘There is a sense of exhilaration. But I’ve left a beautiful home and a beautiful family now. ‘I’m a stranger again. It’s hard to celebrate. I know I should be happy, but I’m not. I just feel incredible sadness.’ He revealed that, fearing a jail sentence was looming, he had been planning a possible escape from Australia for six months. Referring to Justice John Logan, who sat in the Queensland Supreme Court to deliver the three year sentence last week, Foster said: ‘If the judge had given me three months which in itself is severe for a contempt charge, I probably would have served it. Help: Foster helped Cherie Blair to purchase two discounted flats in Bristol in 2002, sparking alarm that she had used a notorious conman . ‘There isn’t a lawyer you could ring in Brisbane who wouldn’t say the sentence was savage and wouldn’t stand up on appeal.’ He has previously told the court in a letter that he would give himself up once he knew that his ageing, ailing mother, Lou Foster, could be cared for if he was in prison. Now he has told the Brisbane paper that ‘this is not about avoiding jail. ‘This is bigger than me. It’s about my mother. She will not spend the twilight days of her life in a nursing home. She will spend it being cared for by me and she will spend it with a cool sea breeze in her hair, in the shade of a coconut palm. ‘Her therapy will be floating in a blue lagoon. I just know this place (Fiji) will be my mother’s fountain of youth.’ He insisted that he had been maliciously prosecuted because he was Peter Foster. The self-promoted ‘international man of mystery’ said the steps he had put in place to leave Australia were always an ‘in case of emergency, break glass’ situation. Family ties: Foster has previously told the court in a letter that he would give himself up once he knew that his mother, Lou Foster, could be cared for if he was in prison. The pair are pictured together with Fijian police officers in 2006 . ‘As it was, this judge broke the glass for me when he handed down probably the highest sentence for contempt ever in this country and for one of the most insignificant contempt ever.’ He then made a ‘playing with fire’ comment in which he said what the Judge could do with his sentence. Foster, . who has been imprisoned in Britain, the US and Australia in relation to . his banned involvement in the weight loss industry, knows Fiji well. He . spent many years in the country when he was younger and had rented a . villa with his mother. But . he became heavily involved in Fiji politics and then he was arrested and . charged with money laundering. He literally ran from police but was . caught when he dived into a river and hit his head on a boat. Later, . however, he escaped on a yacht and swam ashore in neighbouring Vanuatu, . where he was arrested again and deported to Australia. Paradise: Foster told a newspaper that he wanted his mother Lou to spend the her twilight years with a 'cool sea breeze' in Fiji . He told the Sunday Mail at the weekend that he was now being looked after by friends in Fiji and that he hoped to have an audience this week with acting Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama to talk about receiving permanent asylum. But whether he is successful remains to be seen - Australia is expected to put enormous pressure on the Fijian authorities to arrest the fugitive and deport him to Brisbane. His flight from his prison sentence, which has embarrassed police and immigration authorities, is certain to bring an added jail term. While he has refused to reveal just how he got out of the country, there would be only two ways - by air or sea. Had he attempted to use a false passport at an airport, it would have been picked up by a sophisticated scanning system - particularly as a watch has been issued for him. His most likely escape would have been by sea, using a yacht to slip away from a ‘quiet port’ and head direct to Fiji.","Peter Foster, 51, broke an order not to be involved in the slimming industry .

Just an average British girl: A photo of 'White Widow' Samantha Lewthwaite taken from her fake South African passport released by Kenyan police . The father of White Widow Samantha Lewthwaite is appalled by the idea that his daughter may have masterminded the massacre in the Kenyan mall, neighbours have said. Former soldier Andy Lewthwaite came face to face with the toll of terror attacks when he served in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles in the 1970s. Now he is struggling to come to terms with allegations that his daughter - already the world's most wanted woman - was behind the attack that has killed more than 60 people in Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi. A neighbour told the Daily Mirror: 'Andy is aware of how appalling indiscriminate shootings are. 'For him to imagine his own daughter is involved in this is very painful. 'He has been very dignified... his daughter is apparently tarnishing both his reputation and his country's reputation.' Their comments come after it emerged that Lewthwaite's frail 85-year-old grandmother has been admitted to hospital because of the stress of her granddaughter's notoriety. Elizabeth Allen, from Banbridge, Co Down, was given a panic alarm to contact security services in case terror suspect Lewthwaite ever made contact. Family friends say the pressure of the situation and Lewthwaite's now-global notoriety have taken their toll on the frail pensioner's health and mental well-being. Joan Baird, a veteran Ulster Unionist councillor in Banbridge who knows the family, said: 'This is so distressing for everyone. Mrs Allen is 85 and she is in and out of hospital. It is just so distressing. 'Certainly, everybody in the town is shocked and distressed by the news.' Lewthwaite from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, who converted to Islam age 17, was married to Jermaine Lindsay before he blew himself up in the July 7 terror attacks in London in 2005, killing 26. The 29-year-old mother of three is already wanted by Kenyan police over alleged links to a terrorist cell that planned to bomb the country’s coast. Moody: Lewthwaite from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, who converted to Islam age 17, was married to Jermaine Lindsay before he blew himself up in the July 7 terror attacks in London in 2005, killing 26 . Now it is suspected that she was the mastermind behind the four-day gun and bomb attack on Westgate Shopping Centre in Nairobi, which has led to a continuing siege in which more than 60 people have lost their lives. However, Somali terrorist group Al Shabaab claimed today that no women were involved in the attack. Born to English soldier Andy . Lewthwaite - who met and married Irish Catholic Christine Allen while . serving in Northern Ireland during the 1970s - she enjoyed an . unremarkable childhood on Banbridge's Whyte Acres estate. Lewthwaite was still at primary school when her family moved to Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. In 1995 her parents split. Councillor Raj Khan, whose family knew Lewthwaite’s family socially in Aylesbury, said he is surprised at speculation she is involved in the attack in Kenya due to how he remembers her. Read all about it: A Kenyan vendor sells a newspaper with an article on its front page about Lewthwaite's alleged involvement in the terror attack which began on Saturday in Nairobi and has claimed more than 60 lives . 'She was an average, British, young, . ordinary girl. She had a very great personality. She didn’t have very . good confidence,' he said. Lewthwaite at school aged 16 or 17: She is the daughter of a British soldier father and an Northern Irish Catholic mother who split up in 1995 . After . becoming a Muslim, Lewthwaite changed her name to Sherafiyah and . married suicide bomber Lindsay, who she had met on an Islamic internet . chatroom. Mr Khan recalled a meeting with . Lewthwaite and Lindsay regarding a housing issue which took place three . or four weeks before the July 7 bombings, and he said she was just as he . remembered her. 'Certainly when I was around her, she was the same person, lacking in confidence. 'She . was not strong-headed. And that’s why I find it absolutely amazing that . she is supposed to be the head of an international criminal terrorist . organisation,' he said. Mr Khan said he was 'perplexed' that . someone he knew, who was so 'empty in confidence', was being linked to . international terrorism. He . said he prays that she is not involved, adding: '...and of course my . worry is that if she in involved, is she under some kind of duress? Is . there other factors involved? 'Or indeed, is it Samantha? I mean there are so many questions to be answered at the moment before one can make a view.' Mr Khan said her family will be 'very upset' if she is involved. 'Of . course like anyone else, they will be very hurt, very upset, very, very . upset, but I think they too will be waiting for proof, not . speculation,' he said. Suspicion . that Lewthwaite was in the attack in Nairobi were raised after the . Kenyan foreign minister claimed that a British woman who has has . allegedly been involved in terrorism 'many times before' was among the . militants. The Aylesbury home of Andy Lewthwaite, Samantha's father: Lewthwaite was still at primary school when her family moved from Banbridge, Northern Ireland to to Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire . Amina Mohamed . said the woman acted alongside 'two or three' Americans as security . forces began a fourth day of fighting at the shopping centre where at . least six Britons are known to have died. A British policeman has testified in Kenya in the trial of a Briton accused of plotting attacks and who has ties to al-Shabaab, the Somali group behind a weekend attack on the shopping mall. Jermaine Grant (pictured below today in court), of East London, was arrested in December 2011 in a raid by Kenyan anti-terrorism police on his apartment in the Kenyan port city of Mombasa, along with a female accomplice, Warda Breik, who police said was his wife. Police said a third suspect, believed to be Samantha Lewthwaite, escaped in that raid. Grant and Warda face charges of being found in possession of explosive material recovered from their apartment, and a conspiracy to commit a felony, charges they both deny. Robert Garric, a detective constable with New Scotland Yard police, working in the forensic management team under the counter-terrorism command, told the court he had been part of a team deployed to assist Kenyan police. Mr Garric said he and his team were told by Kenyan police that ‘they were looking at a plot to detonate explosives in parts of Kenya.’ He said he had been informed that a Briton, Grant, had been arrested using a false Canadian identity. The detectives were led to a government laboratory where they were conducting tests on chemicals recovered from Grant's apartment, Mr Garric said. Mr Garric, a bomb scene examiner, manager and counter-terrorism investigator, said the kind of chemicals found, if mixed for a short time, could make explosives that ‘could detonate easily when exposed to shock or flame.’ Earlier this month, Grant was acquitted by a Nairobi court of robbery with violence, charges that could have carried the death penalty, but remained in custody because of the trial in Mombasa. Prosecutor Jacob Ondari said three detectives from Scotland Yard were among his witnesses. However . there was confusion over Ms Mohamed’s comments - made while attending . the United Nations General Assembly in New York - with no confirmation . either from the authorities in Nairobi or the Foreign Office in London. They . directly contradict the Kenyan interior minister Joseph Ole Lenku who . yesterday told a news conference that all the attackers were male - . although he suggested that some may have been dressed as women. The Foreign Office said only that it was aware of the foreign minister’s comments. 'We . continue to liaise very closely with the Kenyan authorities and to . support their investigation into this attack,' a spokesman said. After . her husband Lindsay detonated his suicide bomb at on a Piccadilly line . tube train between King's Cross and Russell Square stations in 2005, . Lewthwaite had told how she was horrified by the massacre. But the Jamaican-born Muslim convert, who grew up in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, had never made a secret of his extremist views, alarming teachers by attempting to radicalise younger pupils. In 2009 Lewthwaite disappeared with her three children but resurfaced two years later after travelling to Kenya on a false passport. The Kenyan authorities issued a photograph of a white woman in a veil who they said was wanted for questioning about a bomb factory in the coastal resort of Mombassa. The woman was Lewthwaite. It is understood she has had little contact with relatives in Northern Ireland since her conversion to Islam. Mr Khan said he does not think the speculation surrounding Lewthwaite will cause divisions in Aylesbury due to the community’s maturity. 'Of course if it is Samantha indeed, of course they’ll be very hurt, very upset, as indeed any human being would be, but in terms of causing any differences in our community I think the community is far more mature for that kind of thing,' he said. Stuart Osborne, who was until recently the Met's Head of Counter Terrorism Command, told ITV News that any role Lewthwaite has with Islamist militant group al-Shabaab is unclear. He said: ‘Lewthwaite has obviously been involved in terrorism or connected with terrorists for some considerable time now. Her role in al-Shabaab is very unclear or even if she has a role within (it). ‘She is currently wanted by the Kenyan authorities in relation to an investigation for those who have committed acts of terrorism. But as yet she is untried and unconvicted for those offences. ‘Traditionally she would be seen to be somebody as a sympathiser, a facilitator or an instigator of terrorism. ‘She has certainly got a large media profile, certainly in the British media press in relation to her activities and her involvement in terrorist activities is still yet to be proven, but as I said she is still wanted for terrorist offences.’","Andy Lewthwaite 'fears his daughter has tarnished him and his country'

The peer who was once the most powerful civil servant in Britain has laid into ministers for their ‘ludicrous bias’ in favour of elderly people. Sir Gus O’Donnell has also criticised their determination to bring down immigration. In an outspoken article, he said that continuing to let the young subsidise the old was ‘bad economics and bad social policy’ – but governments were afraid to upset pensioners as they were more likely to vote. The former Cabinet Secretary, who served three prime ministers from 2005 to 2011, questioned whether it was right that the elderly get free bus passes and prescriptions while public finances were so tight. Writing in The Political Quarterly, Lord O’Donnell also warned that the UK will be in the ‘global slow lane for years to come’ and that its productivity performance was ‘far from stellar’. ‘The government’s determination to bring down net migration may lower future potential output,’ he said. In a wide-ranging article about how to achieve a ‘better politics for a better Britain’, the peer said radical change was needed as the country was in a ‘bad place’. He also suggested politicians should not be able to stand as an MP unless they met certain ‘pre-qualification criteria’. And he controversially called on all new government policies to be overseen by an independent body made up of ex-ministers and civil servants – called the Office for Taxpayer Responsibility. As Cabinet Secretary, Lord O'Donnell was seen as being so powerful in Whitehall that he was nicknamed ‘GOD’. A year after retiring to the Lords, he has now written that public spending needs to reined in because ‘the rising trend in obesity, the growth of dementia and Alzheimer’s and mental health issues in general make it hard to see how the state can afford to help all who need it’. Part of the problem, he said, was that ministers are too wary of powerful lobby groups who mobilise to prevent any effort to cut their benefits. ‘One obvious example is the plethora of special payments and perks given to the over-60s like free bus passes or prescriptions,’ he said. 'Should all over-60s get free prescriptions?' questions Lord O'Donnell. He says part of the problem was ministers are too wary of powerful lobby groups . ‘Should all over-60s get free prescriptions? Why are we paying winter fuel allowances to millionaire pensioners on the Costa Brava? ‘This is all part of the ludicrous bias whereby the old are subsidised by the young. It is bad economics and bad social policy. Unfortunately it has been judged to be good politics as the old have a higher propensity to vote.’ 'The public are being faced with a choice . between a free, but second rate, public service following the cutbacks; . and an expensive, but very customer-focused private sector’ - Lord O'Donnell . Lord O'Donnell said the failure to control costs meant that in ever more areas, ‘the public are being faced with a choice between a free, but second rate, public service following the cutbacks; and an expensive, but very customer-focused private sector’. He said the NHS was ‘expensive and inefficient’, and claimed the education system does not produce the skills that businesses need. Lord O’Donnell also called on MPs to receive training to prepare them for jobs as ministers. But he did not spell out what criteria he thought candidates for Parliament should meet as part of his ‘pre-qualification criteria’. However, a spokesman for the Cabinet Office said: ‘At present they undergo rigorous scrutiny by the electorate. It’s called democracy.’","Sir Gus O’Donnell wrote in the Political Quarterly .

Mohammed Inayat, the father of Kalsoom Bibi (pictured), tried to wipe out his family after she told him she wanted to marry for love, a court heard . A father tried to wipe out his family and killed his wife after their daughter said she wanted to marry for love, a court heard. Mohammed Inayat flew into a rage when his daughter Kalsoom Bibi told him she planned to move to Dubai to marry a policeman. He said she had brought ‘dishonour on the family’ and allegedly threatened to kill her, before pouring gallons of petrol over his family home and setting it alight. On the night of April 17 Inayat killed his wife Naika and injured his three daughters in a blaze that took seconds to engulf the house, Birmingham Crown Court heard. Naika died of carbon  monoxide poisoning and one of his  daughters, 16-year-old Saimah, who jumped from a bedroom window, suffered 50 per cent burns. The father-of-six soaked seven parts of his home in petrol at about 5am as his family slept – only hours before Miss Bibi, 28, was set to fly to Dubai to marry the CID officer. Inayat, 56, denies murder and also faces four charges of attempted murder and arson with intent to endanger life. After initially telling police the fire was started by ‘a gang led by a white middle-aged woman’, he admitted one count of manslaughter. ‘You will hear about the intention of Kalsoom Bibi to marry a man she had fallen in love with,’ Philip Bennett QC, prosecuting told the court. ‘For this defendant a love marriage was not appropriate. He was traditional in his beliefs  that marriage should be arranged.’ Miss Bibi, who is already divorced from a marriage arranged by her father, met her lover in 2011 but had to travel in secret to see him in Dubai. When her family discovered the affair in December last year, they disapproved, and her father became increasingly angry and upset, the jury heard.

European countries could be billed for benefits paid to foreign nationals who arrive in Britain, MailOnline can reveal. Ministers are examining the idea that welfare payments made to EU nationals could be charged back to their home countries. The recharge scheme would apply for the first two years that a migrant was in the UK, and would seek to tackle the impression that Britain was a soft touch on benefits. Recoup: The costs of paying benefits to foreign nationals would be reclaimed from their home countries under plans being considered by ministers . The government has stepped up efforts to limit access to Britain’s welfare system for new arrivals. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has vowed to fight European Commission demands to water down rules on benefit claims by EU immigrants. The UK government will go to court in a battle with the Commission, who want to challenge a key part of our safeguards to ensure that benefits are only paid to people who are legally allowed to live in Britain. The controversial ‘Go home or face . arrest’ poster vans targeted at illegal immigrants are to be axed . because they have been ineffective. Sources . close to Home Secretary Theresa May said she had examined the evidence . for continuing the Government’s billboard campaign which resulted in the . voluntary repatriation of just one person. ‘She doesn’t think there was anything . wrong with the principle of the scheme but it is clear it has not been . effective,’ said one source. The . campaign has been piloted in six London boroughs featuring leaflets and . posters with the message: ‘In the UK illegally? Go home or face . arrest.’ Two vans were driven around displaying . the slogan and advertising a telephone helpline offering support and . advice to illegal migrants who want to leave the UK. Ministers want to tackle the ‘pull factors’ which attract migrants from the rest of Europe to Britain. Bureaucrats in Brussels insist there is no evidence people are attracted to the UK by its welfare system. But now ministers are examining the idea of having the cost of benefits for foreigners refunded by the country they came from. A growing number of northern European countries are thought to be keen to tackle the cost of benefits paid to people from elsewhere in the EU. A Foreign Office source said: ‘Officials have been asked if it is possible to return to the system that was in place until the 1990s. 'For the first two years someone was here, we would pay the benefits and then charge the cost back to their home country. ‘It might not raise huge sums but it would send a clear message about who is picking up the bill for these people.’ Almost one in 10 people claiming Jobseekers' Allowance is not British. Latest figures show 142,300 foreign nationals were on the dole, including 35,000 from the EU. The move comes as ministers vow to step up efforts to recoup the costs of NHS treatment for foreign nationals. A major new government study puts the cost of ‘health tourism’ at £2billion, up to 100 times more than previously thought. It concluded the Health Service has . ‘some of the most generous rules in the world’. And it even found . evidence of relatives of migrants taking advantage of visits to Britain . to have free treatment. Ministers . have vowed to improve the way the NHS claims back the cost of treating . visitors’ treatment from the European Economic Area from their home . countries. At present the . habitual residence test applies to most people from the EEA, which . includes all the member states of the EU and Iceland, Liechtenstein and . Norway. Claimants: Official figures show how tens of thousands of foreign nationals are on benefits in the UK . Bill: The cost of health tourism has been put at £2billion by a new government study . It covers benefits including Jobseeker's Allowance, housing benefit, council tax benefit and Income Support. To receive welfare payments they must prove they have a right to reside, including being able to support themselves, be working and planning to stay in the UK for some time. Government officials have warned ministers that reclaiming the cost of benefits from home countries could be hard to reintroduce, because the EU has expanded markedly since it was phased out. However, the Tories are determined to take a tough line on immigration ahead of the lifting of restrictions on migrant workers from Bulgaria and Romania coming to Britain.","Officials asked to draw up plans to bill EU countries for welfare costs .

Diphenhydramine, which is an ingredient in allergy drugs such as Benadryl (pictured), plays a role in blocking the recall of painful, haunting memories in humans, according to Swiss scientists . Almost eight million people are plagued by bad memories and have the disorder in the U.S. alone, according to the National Institutes of Health. Geneticists from the University of Basel, Switzerland believe tiny traits in a person's genome might be to blame. They compared the genomes of 2,500 healthy, young volunteers who had completed an emotional memory performance test and found a cluster of gene traits that were common in the volunteers who more easily recalled painful memories, Medical Daily reported. The scientists them cross-checked the traits with a list of commonly used drugs to see if any of them had a positive effect on helping to block bad memories. Eliminating compounds known to trigger unhelpful side effects, the geneticists focused on a set of nine gene-drug pairings. The research could have have huge implications for people who have lived through a traumatic experience, such as soldiers at war, and suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder . Concentrating on these nine genetic traits, the scientists looked at biological data from a group of 340 holocaust survivors. By studing this group of people, the scientists aimed to finally target a single gene that was found to be linked to the recall of bad memories and discovered it is the gene for histamine receptor H1 (HRH1). This is the same gene that when overstimulated by allergies, triggers a runny nose and even asthma in certain people. To test whether allergy medication could block negative memories, 40 individuals took diphenhydramine and were asked to recall upsetting events in their lives. The scientists discovered that while the drug reduces the recall of bad memories, it had no effect on neutral and happy recollections. Professor Andreas Papassotiropoulos, of the Psychiatric University Clinics at the university, and co-lead author of the study, said: 'The rapid development of innovative methods for genetic analysis has made this new and promising approach possible. 'In a further study, we will try to identify and develop memory enhancing drugs,' he added.

"CO2 may have been trapped into rocks in a process called carbonation . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 05:19 EST, 23 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:27 EST, 23 October 2013 . Scientists have discovered how the atmosphere of Mars turned to stone. British researchers believe they have worked out how Mars lost its early carbon-dioxide-rich atmosphere to become the cold and arid planet it is today. The research provides the first direct evidence on Mars of a process called 'carbonation', whereby a chemical reaction between carbon dioxide, water and chemicals within solid rock react to 'suck in' the carbon and trap it within the rock. The process exists here as well, and scientists believe understanding and harnessing carbonation could make it an ally in controlling climate and CO2 emissions on Earth. Scroll down for video . British researchers believe they have worked out how Mars lost its early carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere to become the cold and arid planet it is today . It is widely recognised that accumulation of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere is contributing to global warming. However, the loss of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of Mars around 4,000 million years ago is likely to have caused the planet to cool. The research was carried out at the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre, the University of Glasgow, and the Natural History Museum in London . In a paper published in the journal Nature Communications, the research team describes analyses of a Martian meteorite known as Lafayette, sourced from the research collections of the Natural History Museum and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. Researchers found evidence of carbonation by studying a meteorite known as Lafayette (pictured). The meteorite is thought to have landed on Earth roughly 3000 years ago . The latest theory is the CO2 in Mars' atmosphere was sucked into rocks, in . a process called carbonation. The process occurs naturally on Earth, and if harnessed, could be used to combat climate change. Researchers at the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre, the University of Glasgow and the Natural History Museum in London found evidence of this by studying a meteorite known as Lafayette. The meteorite is thought . to have landed on Earth roughly 3,000 years ago. They found patterns of carbonate minerals in the meteorite by using an electron scanning microscope. These patterns form . when carbon dissolved in liquid water seeps into rocks containing the . mineral olivine. The carbon replaces the olivine, locking it away in the rock. It formed from molten rock around 1,300 million years ago, and was blasted from the surface of Mars by a massive impact 11 million years ago. Since its discovery in Indiana, US, in 1931, Lafayette has been studied by scientists around the world. The new research focused on a carbon-rich mineral called siderite. Although found in Lafayette previously, the team discovered that the siderite had formed by the process of 'carbonation', whereby water and carbon dioxide from the Martian atmosphere reacted with rocks containing the mineral olivine. These reactions then formed siderite crystals, replacing the olivine, and in so doing captured the atmospheric carbon dioxide and permanently stored it within the rock. Lafayette provides direct evidence for storage of carbon dioxide in the fairly recent history of Mars, some time after 1,300 million years. However, as all of the ingredients for . carbonation were present on early Mars - in the form of olivine, water . and carbon dioxide - this reaction may explain how carbon dioxide was . removed from the planet's atmosphere, changing its climate from warm, wet . and hospitable to life, to cold, dry and hostile. The research may explain how carbon dioxide was removed from Mars' atmosphere changing its climate from warm, wet and hospitable to life, the hostile one that Nasa's Curiosity rover (pictured) is exploring today . While this process also occurs naturally on Earth, and is the focus of research examining methods of permanently locking up carbon dioxide from power stations, the magnitude of the effect on early Mars indicates that it has the potential to be effective on a planetary scale. Lead author Doctor Tim Tomkinson, of the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre, said: 'Mars once had a thick atmosphere that was rich in water and carbon dioxide, and so this process of carbonation may help answer the mystery of why the Martian climate deteriorated around 4,000 million years ago. 'This discovery is both significant in terms of the way in which scientists will study Mars in the future but also to providing us with vital clues to how we can limit the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere and so reduce climate change.'","CO2 may have been trapped into rocks in a process called carbonation .

The FBI has released its latest statistics on violent crime in America and the dubious honor of most violent state belongs to Tennessee. Where there is low income and low rates of education, there are higher rates of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, according to the numbers. There are exceptions, though. Also on the list of 10 most violent states are Alaska, Delaware, and Maryland, which all have better income and education rates than the national average. Scroll down for the list of 10 most violent states... Violent: A lively shot of the famous Beale Street in Memphis may hide Tennessee's brutal truth--the state has the nation's highest rate of violent crime . Using the 2012 FBI data, 24/7 Wall St. identified the 10 states with the highest violent crime rates per 100,000 residents. In addition, they looked at each state’s income, poverty, and education statistics. In all but a few cases, the correlation appeared clear. Number 9 on the list Maryland may be wealthy and educated relative to the rest of the country, by extremely high crime in crime-riddled cities likely keeps the Old Line State on the list. The same is likely true for the tiny adjoining state of Delaware, which comes in at number 6 on the list. And what of sparsely populated Alaska’s appearance on the list? The relatively better educated and richer than average Last Frontier comes in at number 3, reports 24/7 Wall St., because of its nation-leading rate of forcible rape. Feeling lucky? Due in part to the gambling and casino industries, Nevada is the second most violent crime riddled state in the union . Surprise: Most data show that violent crime follows high poverty and low education. But Alaska is above average in those areas. Nonetheless, it has the nation's highest rate of forcible rape . For every 100,000 people in 2012, there were 79.7 incidents of the crime in Alaska. Number 1 Tennessee had the highest rate of aggravated assaults in 2012 and was near the top for murders and robberies. Like other states on the list, Tennessee’s crime is concentrated in the more densely populated cities of Nashville and Memphis. Using FBI data for 2012, 24/7 Wall St. assembled a list of the top states for violent crime rates per 100,000 residents. Instead of showing that with the highest populations come the highest crime, the study found that crimes like rape, assault, and murder follow trends in high poverty and low education. 1. Tennessee . 2. Nevada . 3. Alaska . 4. New Mexico . 5. South Carolina . 6. Delaware . 7. Louisiana . 8. Florida . 9. Maryland . 10. Oklahoma . But unlike Maryland and Delaware, Tennessee fits the national mold with its high poverty and low education rates. At number 2 is the state of Nevada, where the gambling and casino industries bring with them the nation’s highest robbery and assault rates. The Silver State also has some of the worst high school and college graduation rates. Fans of the recently concluded AMC series Breaking Bad will recognize number 4 on the list. New Mexico, where violent crime is the fourth worst in the U.S., also lays claim to one of the highest rates of drug use in the nation. At number 5 is South Carolina, where the poverty and higher education rates rank among America’s worst and where the murder rate is the fifth worst in the country. Number 7 Louisiana is number 1 for its murder rate. The Bayou State, which has a poverty rate of almost 20 percent, saw 495 murders in 2012 and 427 people were shot in New Orleans alone. In Florida, crime rates have been on the decline for 20 years, which is also reflected in the national trend. The Sunshine State has been improving as far as rape, murders, and other crimes and has seen improved high school graduation rates. However, at number 8, the state has quite far to rise. Finally, Oklahoma comes in at number 10. The state had the sixth highest incidence of forcible rape last year, its worst showing in that area since 1994. Also on the rise is aggravated assault, with 337.3 such crimes for per 100,000 residents in 2012. Urban Institute senior fellow John Roman tells 24/7 Wall St. that violent crimes occur with more frequency where people are racially segregated. According to Roman, the more integrated a place becomes, the more markedly crime is seen to decline because those at the bottom of the economic totem pole may more easily climb into the middle class.","A list compiled using 2012 FBI crime data shows that murder, rape, robbery and assault tends to occur most often in the poorest, least educated places ."

In a twist on the 1980s TV comedy-drama Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, Angela Merkel’s administration wants to poach the cream of the UK’s young workers into the service of her country’s formidable industrial machine. Berlin is launching a £120million drive to lure hundreds of Britons aged 18-35 on to all-expenses-paid, three-year apprenticeships with German firms to plug the skills gap in the EU’s most prosperous economy. Comedy: The German economic miracle - which for years attracted building workers from Britain, including the hapless Geordies at the centre of Auf Wiedersehen, Pet (pictured) - has so far survived the eurozone crisis . The hope is that many recruits will stay permanently in the country, which is worried about a looming lack of well-qualified workers because of its ageing population. At 7.5 per cent, Germany’s youth unemployment rate is a fraction of that in the UK, where the proportion of jobless under-25s is just over 20 per cent, leaving almost a million youngsters looking for work. The Germans see the recruitment drive as an altruistic offer of work to youngsters who are starved of opportunities at home. But it has inevitably led to fears they will cherry pick some the most gifted young Britons. Candidates, who must be educated to A-level standard, are being offered a work-and-study package including wages of nearly £700 a month after tax plus 170 hours of free language lessons. They will also receive relocation costs, two expenses-paid visits a year home, plus training at one of Germany’s highly-regarded vocational schools. New recruits: Angela Merkel's administration in Germany wants to poach the cream of the UK's young workers into the service of her country's formidable industrial machine . The German economic miracle – which for years attracted  building workers from Britain, including the hapless Geordies at the centre of Auf Wiedersehen, Pet – has so far survived the eurozone crisis but the country has 33,000 unfilled apprenticeships. 'British employers will have to try harder to get the best young apprentices as it is more competition' Bob Bischof, German-British Chamber of Industry and Commerce . Bob Bischof, of the German-British Chamber of Industry and Commerce, said: ‘This is a great offer for young Britons to get top-flight training in Germany. 'We hope many of those who come over will like the life, maybe meet a German partner, and stay for good. It means British employers will have to try harder to get the best young apprentices as it is more competition.’ Apprentices in Britain are paid a minimum of around £345 a month if under 19, though some employers pay more. This goes up to a minimum of £785 a month for those over 21. Wulf Schroeter, of the International Business Academy, which is running the scheme in the UK, said: ‘Generally, the brightest youngsters don’t like to be unemployed. Therefore they wouldn’t leave their country if there are enough alternatives. ‘It’s the job of the governments everywhere to establish conditions for the economy to invest their money and create jobs.’","Idea is a twist on classic 1980s TV comedy-drama Auf Wiedersehen, Pet .

Mars may once have been rocked by titanic supervolcano eruptions that could have shaped the planet's climate, scientists believe. Crater-like features which could be the footprints of the cataclysmic events have been discovered at several sites in the Martian northern highlands. Scientists believe they were left behind by massive volcanic explosions that blasted ash and lava out of the planet's surface more than three billion years ago. Mars may once have been rocked by titanic supervolcano eruptions that may have shaped the planet's climate. This image shows an area of Mars known as Eden Patera looking which is a 70-kilometre wide caldera formed by formed by the collapse of land. Scientists believe the collapse may have followed a supervolcanic eruption . Supervolcano eruptions are thousands of times stronger than those of ordinary volcanoes, and powerful enough to alter global climate and cause mass extinctions. They have occurred in Earth's past, and a plugged supervolcano is said to be simmering beneath Yellowstone National Park in the UK today. Rather than producing typical conical mountains of lava and ash, supervolcanoes erupt suddenly in huge explosions. Because they do not build mountains, evidence of ancient supervolcanoes can be hard to detect. But scientists think they may have formed a series of irregularly shaped craters in an area of Mars known as Arabia Terra. If future work shows that supervolcanoes were present more widely on ancient Mars, it would completely change estimates of how the atmosphere formed from volcanic gases, how sediments formed from volcanic ash and how habitable the surface might have been . A volcano becomes a 'supervolcano' if it erupts more than 1,000 cubic kilometres of magma. Their eruptions are thousands of . times stronger than those of ordinary volcanoes, and powerful enough to . alter global climate and cause mass extinctions. Supervolcanos occur when magma in the mantle rises into the crust from but is unable to break through. Pressure builds in a large and growing magma pool until the crust is unable to contain it. Yellowstone is one example of a supervolcano on Earth. The last eruption was 630,000 years ago, and was 1,000 times bigger than the Mount St Helens eruption in 1980. The ancient, crater-pockmarked region is covered by layers of fine-grained material of unknown origin that could have been left by explosive eruptions. One of the best examples of what might be a supervolcano remnant is Eden Patera, a depression in the Martian surface 85km wide and 1.8km deep. It is linked to at least three other depressions in what scientists describe as a ‘caldera complex’. Other supervolcano candidates include the 700 metre-deep Euphrates Patera, and Siloe Patera, a nest of deep craters extending up to 1,750 metres below the surrounding plains. The volcanoes may have produced powdery deposits identified by Nasa rovers at two landing sites, Meridiani Planum and Gale Crater. Many Martian volcanoes are easily recognised from their massive shield-shaped structure, similar to what we see in Hawaii. 'But these are relatively youthful features on Mars and we have always wondered where the ancient volcanoes are,' said Dr Joseph Michalski, from the Natural History Museum . Gases released by the eruptions would . have altered the Martian climate, according to the scientists writing in . the journal Nature. ‘Discovering supervolcanic structures fundamentally changes how we view ancient volcanism on Mars,’ said lead researcher Dr Joseph Michalski, from the Natural History Museum. ‘Many Martian volcanoes are easily recognised from their massive shield-shaped structure, similar to what we see in Hawaii. ‘But these are relatively youthful features on Mars and we have always wondered where the ancient volcanoes are. ‘It is possible that the most ancient volcanoes were much more explosive and formed structures similar to what we now see in Arabia Terra.’ He added: ‘It makes sense that supervolcanoes might have been more common on ancient Mars, particularly if the ancient crust was thinner than it is now. ‘This would allow magma to rise to the surface more quickly, before it could release gases within the crust. ‘If future work shows that supervolcanoes were present more widely on ancient Mars, it would completely change estimates of how the atmosphere formed from volcanic gases, how sediments formed from volcanic ash and how habitable the surface might have been.’","Supervolcanoes are 1000s of times stronger than ordinary volcanoes .

It was a cheesecake date with mayoral front-runner Bill de Blasio to finish the working day in Brooklyn. So naturally President Barack Obama was looking forward to getting home to the family. Making a surprise visit to a Junior's Restaurant, where he greeted every person in the place, Obama - who briefly lived in the New York borough in his younger days - left with two cheesecakes - one traditional and the other strawberry. And he was sure to grab some black-and-white cookies 'for his girls'. The check came to $73 and he paid with $80 cash, according to owner Alan Rosen. 'He said (his daughter's) were going to eat the cookies on Air Force One on the way back to Washington,' Mr Rosen told Politicker. All set: U.S. President Barack Obama walks out with two bags of cheesecake from Junior's Restaurant next to Democratic Mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio in Brooklyn on Friday afternoon . 'He greeted every single customer and every single employee in the building': Onlookers recount Obama's visit to a Brooklyn Junior's with New York City Democratic Mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio . Getting around to everyone and then home: Obama hugs a young girl in the restaurant before going to see his family . 'He greeted every single customer and every single employee in the building, which was quite gracious and amazing to me. 'Literally every single person. 'It was pretty incredible. We're pretty honored.' The president also left behind a signature on one of the eatery's large holiday pumpkins. Brooklyn resident Deborah Howard said she was enjoying her dinner when the president suddenly walked into the restaurant and couldn’t believe her eyes as he walked around the room, hugging people and shaking hands. 'It was great! … He said hello to everybody. They were hugging him and calling out,' she said. 'They applauded him leaving: ‘Thank you for coming. We love you!’ It was really great.' One last thing: President Obama leaves behind an autograph on a Halloween pumpkin before getting his sweets at Junior's restaurant in Brooklyn . Friday night crowd: Plenty were on hand for Obama's visit . Earlier in the day, the president admitted at least two of America's three branches of government needed to brush up on their math. During a visit to the Pathways in Technology Early College High School (P-TECH) in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, Obama observed a level two algebra class, joking that he needed one of the students to help him keep his daughters' math skills up. 'The president joked with one of the girls that he needed her to tutor Sasha and Malia, because he's not very good at helping them with math anymore,' according to a pool reporter traveling with Obama. Sasha and Malia, the Obamas' children, are in the seventh and tenth grades. '""I liked math, but then it started to get harder. And so that can be frustrating,"" the president said, referring to his days as a student,' the pool report continued. But when Obama recalled the classroom visit an hour later in his speech to 600 students and teachers, it was Congress – not he – who needed help with numbers. Real world math: Obama jokingly solicited math tutors for his kids while admitting that he was no longer up to the task . Obama's speech at P-TECH high school touched on immigration, government budgets and education issues and . Adulation: Obama's job approval ratings nationally are abysmal, but he is still wildly popular in politically stalwart 'blue' states like New York, where he arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Friday . 'I know that budgets aren't the most interesting topic for a Friday afternoon,' he said while scolding legislators for the recent government shutdown tussle in Washington, 'even in a school where young people like math.' 'And by the way, I just sat in on a lesson called ""Real World Math,"" which got me thinking whether it's too late to send Congress here for a remedial course.' But the president's ribbing at Congress will be quickly forgotten, at least where it concerns those on the political left. Obama will deliver another speech on Friday night – this time to a New York fundraiser for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee expected to raise up to $32,400 per person. Don't tell FEMA: Obama tried to help build an ""Earthquake Tower"" during a math class, but didn't manage to balance his load .

A lorry driver and passenger are lucky to be alive after their truck lost control on a bridge in China and swerved violently on two wheels before toppling over and crashing. The footage was captured on CCTV as the vehicle travelled over a long sea bridge, which joins the island city of Zhoushan to China's mainland. The white lorry appears to swerve suddenly to avoid hitting another truck in front. The vehicle rolls onto two wheels, but stays upright, before hitting the central barrier and swerving in the other direction. Scroll down for video . Near miss: The two-wheel balancing act starts off with a violent swerve to avoid hitting a lorry in front . It then lurches over to the other side, balancing again on just two wheels before hitting the far barrier which saves it from toppling over the side of the bridge. Remarkably the lorry bounces from one side to the other, rarely with all four wheels on the ground, and looks as though it may have gained control, before it swerves violently and eventually tips over. Cars following the heart-stopping incident grind to a halt behind it. According to media reports, the passenger in the truck suffered a minor head injury. The incident happened on one of the enormous sea bridges that joins the island city of Zhoushan to the Chinese mainland. The 28-mile(46.5km) Zhoushan sea-crossing bridge was opened nearly four years ago and is the longest sea-bridge of its kind in China. The lorry then veers from left to right, bouncing off the crash barriers and balancing on little more than two wheels at a time before eventually crashing . It took 10 years to build and cost 13.1 billion yuan (£193 million). The bridge has opened up trade to and from Zhoushan - the only city among China's more than 1,000 islands - and now lorries are a common sight on the lengthy bridge. The crossing starts at Zhoushan and passes the islands of Lidiao, Fuchi, Cezi and Jintang. It connects with the national expressway network at Zhenhai District in Ningbo, an economically strong city of Zhejiang Province.

Reports say the firearms instructor thought his handgun contained blanks when he shot a man in the arm . A firearms instructor has accidentally shot a student during a gun-safety class in Ohio - the second time he has shot someone by mistake. Shooting range master Terry Dunlap, 73, shot Michael Piemonte in the arm when he accidentally fired a .38 caliber handgun. The bullet first hit a desk at a shooting association training centre, ricocheted off and embedded in his arm. News of the accident has angered another former Dunlap student, Cathy Schmelzer, 50, who was also shot accidentally by the instructor. She told Disptach.com that when she was 14, she was shot in the leg by Dunlap when he fired his weapon to scare his daughter and friends during a Halloween 'haunted hay ride' on his property in Fairfield County, Ohio, US. Dunlap was a police department auxiliary lieutenant at the time, and reports said he thought the gun was loaded with blanks. On reading the latest Dunlap firearms error, Ms Schmelzer, of Prairie Township, Columbus, Ohio, was alarmed that the instructor had done it again. Quoted by the news service, she questioned: 'He’s supposed to be teaching classes and he doesn’t know there’s a live bullet in there?' No criminal or departmental actions were taken against Dunlap because the shooting was deemed accidental, Dispatch.com said. Fairfield County Sheriff, Dave Phalen, told the news service a decision had not yet been made on whether to charge Dunlap for the latest August 10 shooting. The accident happened towards the end of a 12-hour day of training in gun handling and safety, according to Dispatch.com. Weapon: Dunlap thought his .38 handgun contained blanks, reports say, when he fired it and hit a pupil in the arm . Dunlap is qualified to teach classes for Ohioans who are getting their concealed-carry permits. The shooting occurred at the Carroll-based home of the Central Ohio Coonhunters Association Inc., in Fairfield County. Victim Mr Piemonte, 26, of Pataskala, Ohio, told the news service he felt 'torn' about what had happened. On the one hand he said Dunlap was a good instructor, whose class had been 'very informative' and 'well laid out'. On the other hand he pointed out that he got shot, but said he and his wife, who was also in the class, had forgiven Dunlap and keep him in their prayers. Dunlap was formerly a Pickerington police department captain and later served as the community’s safety-service director. He is one of five directors of the Central Ohio Coonhunters Association, in Carroll, Ohio - a hunting and wildlife conservation group founded in 1968. The 73-year-old is also a Violet Township trustee and is seeking re-election in November.

A man waiting for a New York City subway lost his cell phone on the tracks Monday afternoon and then lost his life trying to get it back. The straphanger was reportedly waiting for a train at Manhattan's Christopher Street stop when he dropped his phone and jumped down onto the tracks to retrieve it. When the man made contact with the electrified 'third rail' he was killed. Killed: A man at the Greenwich Village subway stop in Manhattan died Monday when he was electrocuted by the 'third rail' while trying to retrieve a cell phone . This, according to a DNAinfo.com report that puts the time of the Greenwich Village incident, and thus the man's death, at around 3:30pm on July 15. 'Apparently a customer went onto the roadbed and came into contact with the third rail,' a spokesperson for the MTA and the FDNY said. Reached for comment, an NYPD spokesperson declined to say if the unnamed victim had been identified by authorities Monday evening. Traffic: The tragic incident occurred just before rush hour and caused a commuter headache into the late afternoon . Dangerous: Subway deaths are on the rise in 2013. MTA officials have ramped up education efforts aimed at warning riders never to jump to the track to retrieve dropped items, as Monday's victim reportedly did . The incident occurred at rush hour and caused several reroutings and delays for Manhattan commuters into late afternoon. Though relatively rare, electrocutions do occur in New York City's vast system of rail tunnels. And 2013 is shaping up to be a memorable year for subway deaths. This past February, nine subway injuries occurred over the course of just six days, three of which were fatal. Most subway deaths are ruled suicides and occur as a result of a victim being hit by an oncoming train. Few of the deaths are caused by electrocution. Calamity: Just this month, Brooklyn man Matthew Zeno, 30, (pictured) was fatally electrocuted as he urinated on a third rail . But just this month, a Brooklyn man was fatally electrocuted when he urinated on the third rail after a night out to a few bars. Matthew Zeno, 30, decided to walk along the tracks in the early morning hours of July 8. When he relieved himself on the electrified rail, he was killed. A friend who came to Zeno's aid was also electrocuted but was merely injured. The 'third rail,' aka contact rail, operates on 625 volts, easily enough to kill a grown man. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has ramped up education efforts in 2013 aimed at cutting down on subway deaths. Audio announcements and signs throughout the system warn riders never to try retrieving items dropped on the tracks. Powerful: Though subway deaths are rare, they are on the rise in 2013. Most do not occur from electrocution, but the MTA warns riders of the dangers of jumping to the tracks near the deadly 625-volt third rail .","The unidentified man died in the Christopher Street station in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan on Monday afternoon .

American paleontologists have discovered a new species of prehistoric shark, complete with devilish horns and sinfully sharp teeth. The shark, named Devil Tooth or Diablodontus Michaeledmundi, was extracted from a piece of limestone in Flagstaff, Arizona. Scientists at Northern Arizona University believe it was an incredibly tough species that survived the Permian Triassic extinction - the world's largest extinction event. A simple reconstruction of Devil Tooth or Diablodontus Michaeledmundi that was extracted from a piece of limestone in Flagstaff, Arizona . In this event, commonly known as 'The Great Dying' a staggering 96 per cent of life on Earth was wiped out. As the name might suggest, the Devil Tooth shark had incredibly sharp teeth as well as hook-shaped spikes on its head, which are thought to have evolved for defense of even sexual selection. The spikes could have evolved to catch the eye of devil tooth sharks of the opposite sex, just as some animals use them to find a mate today. The fearsome creature was plucked from the Kaibab Formation in Arizona and details of the fossil were published in the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin, Discovery News reported. The scientists believe the fish lived 260 million years ago and was a hybodont, or hump-toothed shark. Devil Tooth had incredibly sharp teeth (its rear teeth are pictured) as well as spikes on its head, which are thought to have evolved for defense of even sexual selection. The spikes could have evolved to catch the eye of devil tooth sharks of the opposite sex, just as some animals use them to find a mate today . This group of sharks is now extinct but were close ancestors of modern sharks, according to Northern Arizona University post-graduate John-Paul Hodnett, who was lead author of the study. 'Hybodont sharks evolved during the late Paleozoic  - approximately 300 . million years ago - and miraculously survived the Permian Triassic . extinction event into the . Mesozoic,' he said. The Devil Tooth shark terrorised the seas for around 50 million years and lived into the 'age of reptiles' 252 million years ago. As well as the hook-like horns on its head, the fish sported spines on the front and back of its fins as well as the asymmetric tail associated with most modern sharks. Mr Hodnett describe the shark's teeth as advanced and said they were: 'well developed pointed cusps with slight . cutting edges, a feature which was not seen until later hybodonts during . the beginning of the Mesozoic.' Judging by the size of its teeth, the Devil tooth shark was around three-and-a-half feet long - slightly smaller than a leopard shark (pictured). Mr Hodnett believes the predator's hunting style might have been similar too as it is thought Devil Tooth searched for small fish and soft-bodied marine creature to eat . Judging by the size of its teeth, the well-equipped predator was around three-and-a-half feet long, which is slightly smaller than a leopard shark. Mr Hodnett believes that the creature's hunting style might have been similar to its modern spotty cousin as it is thought Devil Tooth sharks searched for small fish and soft-bodied marine creature to eat as well as possibly extra sea life living in coastal waters  midway to the surface. The plains where the fossil was found were once a shallow sea that bordered a great desert some 270 million years ago. Hodnett said: 'At this time the ancestors of modern sharks were just starting to diversify, but remained small.' However on dry land, reptiles, dinosaurs, birds and mammals were diversifying at a greater pace.","American Archaeologists discovered Devil Tooth or Diablodontus Michaeledmundi in the Kaibab Formation of Flagstone, Arizona .

Jailed: Gordon Leighton who admitted sexually abusing a child and then had his wrongdoing covered up by the church . A Jehovah’s Witness who sexually abused a child and then had his wrongdoing covered up by the church has been jailed for 13 years. Gordon Leighton, 53, admitted sexually abusing a child when he was confronted with the allegations by church elders at Washington, Tyne and Wear. The elders knew about the 53-year-old’s admissions for three years but refused to co-operate with the criminal investigation, and said what they had heard was confidential. Leighton hit the headlines in the 1990s when his wife Yvonne, 28, died after refusing a blood transfusion after childbirth on religious grounds. Judge Penny Moreland said that he had subjected his victim to 'untold damage' as she sentenced him at Newcastle Crown Court today. The judge said: 'You manipulated her with a combination of affection and attention and violence and threats.' The defendant was found guilty of two charges of indecency with a child and six of indecent assault after a trial. Prosecutor Katherine Dunn told the court it was in 2009 the victim, who is now an adult, broke her silence about what Leighton had done to her. The court heard that at a special meeting at Lambton Kingdom Hall aimed at 'keeping the congregation clean', Leighton 'admitted sexual abuse' and made excuses for his vile behaviour. Miss Dunn said: 'The elders conducted their own investigation. A meeting was arranged and the defendant was confronted with the allegations. 'After initially denying the allegations he broke down and admitted sexually abusing the complainant.' The court heard Leighton, of Washington, refused to answer any questions when interviewed by detectives and claimed his confession at the meeting was limited to reading pornographic material.

Cover girl: McQuiston is on the cover of the May issue of Tatler and gave an interview to the society magazine . But the daughter of a Nigerian oil baron says she faces racism and snobbery from the upper classes unwilling to accept her. ‘There has been some snobbishness, particularly among the much older generation,’ she told society magazine Tatler. ‘There’s class and then there’s the racial thing. It’s a jungle and I’m going through it and discovering things as I grow up. ‘I’m not super-easily offended but it’s a problem when someone’s making . you feel different or separate because of your race. I have never had . anything horrible said or happen, but it is something you sense. You can . just tell with some people.’ The 26-year-old aspiring television chef will marry Ceawlin Thynn, .

He . said he was diagnosed with the rare disease, which causes lumpy bone . formations to grow along lengths of existing bone causing significant . pain, at age 10. After numerous operations and unsuccessful treatments, he discovered in 1971 that smoking a joint helped relieve his pain. Mr . Rosenfeld was one of a small number of lucky patients to be signed up . to be studied as part of a 'Compassionate Investigational New Drug' program with marijuana. The .

Twelve . other states are also in the process of considering loosening the laws . around cannabis possession and use, including Kentucky. Senator .

Rosenfeld's . medical history has been studied by the government for the last 30 . years and Mr Clark and the group want him to address senators and . representatives at the interim joint committee on health and welfare, on . Wednesday, at the capitol annex. The . IND program with cannabis was closed to new entrants by the George H. W.

From the age of 10, Mr Rosenfeld has suffered with a rare and painful bone disease which causes growths on his bones, like this one pictured . At its peak, the program had thirty active patients. Mr . Rosenfeld is one of four survivors, and the only one to have the rare . bone disorder.

Jailed: Jonathan Revill, 38, defrauded his employers of £19million over the course of three years . An IT manager who defrauded his employers out of £19million to fuel his gambling addiction has been jailed for seven years. Jonathan Revill, 38, exploited his position at a multinational energy company to order computer equipment which he then sold for a fraction of its worth, using the proceeds to bet online. He gambled as much as £300,000 on a single sporting fixture and even blew £20,000 in one night after he had been arrested over the deception. During a three-year period he made £5.6million from selling the equipment, but all he had to show for it was a £500,000  family home in West Yorkshire. His wife did not learn of his criminal behaviour – or his secret gambling addiction – until he was caught and she was told they would lose their home. Revill, a father of one, pleaded guilty at Leeds Crown Court to four offences of fraud and three of transferring criminal property – selling goods obtained by crime. He was employed as a service delivery systems manager at a Leeds-based subsidiary company of GDF Suez – one of the world’s biggest energy companies with a billion-pound turnover. Mehran Nassiri, prosecuting, said Revill was earning a £55,000 a year with a £400-a-month car allowance but had a ‘serious addiction to gambling’. Less than a year after he started working for the firm he realised he could place orders that would not be noticed. Although he was limited to £3,000 purchases without further approval, he forged signatures and over the next three years ordered equipment worth £18,976,000. It was delivered either to his home in Huddersfield or to a storage unit, Revill then either auctioned it on eBay or sold it for a fraction of its value to one of six companies. Home: Revill used the proceeds of his fraud to buy this £500,000 family house in Huddersfield . Addiction: Revill once spent £300,000 in a single session of gambling on websites such as Bet365 . His deception came to light in May . when an audit at GDF Suez revealed financial irregularities – but by . then he had gambled away nearly all of the £5.6million he raised from . selling the goods. Jailing . him for seven years, Judge Geoffrey Marson QC said: ‘This was a vast . amount of money.’ He warned Revill that his wife and daughter would now . have to look for somewhere else to live. After his arrest, Revill was granted bail on condition that he stopped gambling and sought immediate help for his addiction. However, on June 2 he accessed more than £20,000 in an Isle of Man-based account and gambled it in a single evening. Benjamin . Hargreaves, mitigating, said Revill had placed a bet for £11,200 on a . Roger Federer tennis match and £13,000 on a football match during the . betting spree. He added: ‘Winning or losing didn’t matter.’ Big game: After his arrest, the IT manager gambled thousands on the result of a football match between England and Brazil, pictured . Loss: Revill wasted £11,250 betting against Roger Federer, pictured, on the same day . Mr . Hargreaves said Revill had tried to win big to pay back the company and . at one time had £3million in his account ‘trying to get myself out of . the hole I’d dug’ – but that had gone. Revill was relieved to be finally caught and was shocked at the total involved, he said. ‘He . accepts over the last ten years a gambling problem has got bigger and . bigger. The problem is his own and he should have sought help and by his . lies and trying to hide it he brought himself to this.’ Detective . Chief Inspector Mark  Griffin, who heads the Leeds District Proceeds of . Crime Act Team, said: ‘Revill abused his position of trust. ‘His . actions have destroyed his life and affected a number of businesses. This case clearly highlights the very serious consequences of gambling . addiction.’ The court heard . that Revill had built up debts during four months of unemployment . before starting his job at GDF Suez in April 2009. He had also been made bankrupt in 2005, but had not told his wife.

Social media users should compose a ‘famous last Tweet’ to go out after they are dead, according to legal experts. Although it may sound grim, experts claim the move is only a digital extension of the last requests many people make in a will. This advice has been given in a new guide from experts SagaLegal.co.uk which advises people on how to sort out their 'digital legacy.' Social media users should compose a 'famous last Tweet' to go out after they are dead, according to experts . And it includes getting Facebook and Twitter users to prepare their final messages to go out to friends and followers from beyond the grave. That way, the news will go out far beyond immediate family and friends and could prevent accidental but insensitive messages on a social media page such as birthday greetings from those who did not know. As well as this, many people have a large online presence that may need to be sorted out once they die, said Sagalegal.co.uk's Digital Legacy Guide. This can include online subscriptions to clubs, retailers, websites and money being either paid or owed to the deceased from online betting sites and others. Emma Myers at Saga Legal said: 'In the same way you would not want your loved ones falling out or being inconvenienced over a missing will when you die, it's also imperative to plan ahead for the great internet cafe in the sky' Millions have accounts with sites like Amazon and others who would keep sending email offers to the address of the deceased unless the accounts are closed.

A teenager has been sentenced to life in prison for helping his brother murder his own children in a house fire. Jeremy Wand teamed up with his elder brother Armin to kill his three young nephews as well as an unborn baby girl in exchange for $300 in insurance money. In court yesterday the children's mother Sharon Wand broke down in tears as she recalled how the boys considered their uncle a role model when he taught them how to count and ride a bike. Jailed: Jeremy Wand was yesterday sentenced to life in prison for helping his brother murder his children . Brothers: Three children were killed in the blaze. Joseph, center, Jeffrey, left and Allen, right . 'You were not just an uncle, a brother-in-law - you were like a son to me,' she said during the 19-year-old's sentencing hearing in Darlington, Wisconsin. 'Now I do not know how to feel about you. I still love you - but I hate you for what you did.' Jeremy Wand, who turned 19 yesterday, was handed three life sentences after pleading guilty to six charges, including three counts of being a party to first-degree intentional homicide. The soonest he could be eligible for parole is in 35 years, a judge said during the hearing. Killed: Joseph, left, and Allen Wand, right, died in the blaze set by their father and his brother . Mastermind: Armin Wand III, pictured in court last year, planned to collect insurance money over the deaths . Devastated: Sharon Wand, left at the time of the blaze, gave an emotional speech to court yesterday recalling her three sons who died including Jeffrey, right, who was just five years old . The defendant's 33-year-old brother, Armin Wand III, planned to kill his wife and their four children - including a daughter who survived - then claim insurance money and make a 'fresh start'. The teenager agreed to help his brother, who is serving life in prison without parole, burn down his house in Argyle in return for $300. The pair set fire to some paper in the living room near the plug for the television, so it would look like an electrical blaze. Mrs Wand, 27, was woken up by the fire with her clothes aflame, ran outside and rolled around on the ground. She tried to break the window of the room where her sons Allan, seven, and five-year-old Jeffery were sleeping, but was unable to save them. Heartless: The teenager, pictured arriving in court, was 'like a son' to the mother of the dead children . Sentencing: Judge Thomas Vale, left, told Wand that he would be eligible for parole in 35 years . The frantic mother, who was pregnant with a baby girl, managed to rescue her two-year-old daughter Jessica - but Armin then tried to thrust the girl back into the flames. As well as Allan and Jeffrey, three-year-old Joseph died in the fire, while Mrs Wand miscarried. Her bravery in risking her own safety to help her children was 'nothing short of heroic', a Department of Justice official told the court. Her brother-in-law was seen running away from the scene, and later arrived at school wearing a t-shirt which smelled of smoke. During the hearing, Mrs Wand addressed Jeremy, saying: 'I don’t understand, Jeremy, how could you do something this terrible for $300? 'I wake up every morning hearing my sons begging for help. I have nightmares of them begging for help. And I can’t get to them. 'I’m awake every minute of every day knowing my children are gone due to my brother-in-law’s selfishness.' The 19-year-old's lawyer acknowledged the heinous nature of the crime, but claimed that the youth was being controlled by his elder brother. Judge Thomas Vale ruled that Wand should eventually be eligible for parole, saying he was influenced by the desire of the victims' mother to allow her brother-in-law to rebuild his life.","Jeremy Wand helped brother Armin carry out killing in exchange for $300 .

These new ice cubes will not water down or change the taste of a drink - because they are made from stainless steel. The inert metal cubes will suit connoisseurs who prefer their liqueur on the rocks but cannot stand their drinks being watered down by ice. The stainless steel cubes, known as a 'Puc', also let the drinker more accurately control the temperature as they become colder the more are added. The stainless steel cubes are designed to cool drinks without watering them down like ice cubes . The stainless steel is inert meaning it will not add anything to the drinks or change the taste . Designer Dave Laituri, 51, from Wayland, Massachusetts, said he was inspired by the former trend of using cold ball bearings to 'ice' drinks. He said: 'Early in my design career, I heard a . story that famous designer Raymond Loewy used to drink scotch with . chilled with ball bearings. 'He was quite the classy guy and I've . heard of other famous people from that era using ball bearings to chill . their drink of choice. 'By using ball bearings, it doesn't . dilute the drink with excess water, and that image has always stuck with . me for some reason.' However, he changed the shape because he said the balls would move around too much as the drinker sipped. He said: 'The ball bearings were too mobile and would often take a leap for freedom and roll across the floor when given the chance. 'But with the marshmallow-like ""puck"" shape, they tend to stay put, live at the bottom of the glass for the . duration of the drink and are easier to manage. The designer was inspired by a trend in the early 20th century to cool drinks with ball bearings . 'They are a classy, non-diluting alternative to ice.' Each Puc weighs 70 grams and are 25mmm by 19mm. Stainless steel is 100 per cent inert and therefore will not absorb anything around it and will not add or subtract from the drink. The size of the Pucs has been chosen to allow the customer to add them to suit their liking. Mr Laituri, who set up the company with his son Calvin, said it is up to people to choose how cold they have their drinks when using the cubes. He continued: 'If people want their drink cooler faster, they can simply add another Puc, and after, they can rinse them off and put them back in the freezer. 'Pucs not only chill room temperature drinks, but can also bring blazing hot coffee to a more manageable drinkable temperature for those on the go.'","The metal pucks will cool down drinks without watering them down .

Just a fortnight ago, the former South African president was said to be in a persistent vegetative state and near death. He has been in a Pretoria hospital since June 8 and officials say his condition is critical but stable. It was anticipated that the . anti-apartheid hero may be discharged to mark his birthday but he is . still in hospital with a recurring lung infection. The . Nelson Mandela Center of Memory and other groups have called on people . to volunteer 67 minutes to charity in honour of the 67 years that . Mandela served his community. The United Nations has also recognised the Mandela's struggle against apartheid and say his birthday is an opportunity to honour his legacy, and activities are planned around the globe. The UN said the donation of time is fitting as Mandela worked for 67 years as a human rights lawyer, a prisoner of conscience, a peacemaker and then South Africa's first black president. Mandela's birthday, July 18, was declared Nelson Mandela International Day by the UN General Assembly in 2009 as a recognition of his contribution to the culture of peace and freedom. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s said this year Mandela's birthday comes at a time of 'deep reflection on the life and work of Madiba, as the universally revered leader remains in the hospital'. Since the anti-apartheid hero was hospitalised last month, South Africans have held vigils, sang and prayed for the former president outside his hospital in Pretoria . He added: 'Nelson Mandela gave 67 years of his life to the struggle for human rights and social justice. 'The heart of Nelson Mandela International Day is good works for people and the planet. 'This is the best tribute we can pay to an extraordinary man who embodies the highest values of humanity.'

The defectors claimed in the report that leader Kim Jong-un had handed out copies of the Nazi dictator's manifesto to top officials for inspiration. An unnamed source in China who claims to have seen the defectors' report said the book had been translated and handed out to officials in Pyongyang at the time of Kim's birthday in January. News has emerged from highly secretive North Korea that its leader, Kim Jong Un, has distributed copies of Hitler's Mein Kampf to senior officials to see what they can draw from it . 'Mentioning that Hitler managed to . rebuild Germany in a short time following its defeat in World War 1, Kim . Jong-un issued an order for the Third Reich to be studied in depth and . asked that practical applications be drawn from it,' said the source. The source added that Kim had told his . generals that sports had played a key role in cementing unity and . spreading Nazi ideology in Germany and he had called for policies to . encourage sporting activities among North Koreans. Pyongyang was furious, describing the defector's report as a 'thrice-cursed crime' which was aimed at belittling Kim. Officials threatened to kill the 'human scum' behind the report. Mein Kampf, published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926 offers a mixture of Hitler's autobiography with his political ideology. In it the Nazi leader spoke of the 'Jewish peril', an alleged conspiracy by members of the religious and ethnic group to seize control of the world. He also says Germany needed to seize new territories to the east as 'Lebensraum' (living space) to properly nurture the 'historic destiny' of the German people. During Hitler's years in power, the book was given free to every newlywed couple and every soldier fighting at the front until, by the end of the war, around 10million copies of the book had been circulated in Germany. Owing to its overtly racist content, and the historical consequences of the ideologies it promoted, it remains a hugely controversial volume, banned in some countries. 'We are determined to take substantial . measures to physically remove despicable human scum who are committing . treasons,' the state-run Korean Central News Agency said. 'Sordid human scum will never be able . to look up to the sky, nor be able to find an inch of land to be buried . after their death.' Kim's men also vowed to launch . 'merciless punishment of justice' against Seoul and Washington, capitals . which were accused of encouraging defectors to defame the North Korean . leader. The controversial distribution of Mein Kampf was uncovered by New Focus International, a North Korean-focused news organisation working to get news out of the highly secretive country. The infamous Nazi tome was distributed in a limited edition, called 'a one-hundred copy book' in North Korea, which is published in secret for the country's top officials to read. The source behind the revelations said: 'Kim Jong Un gave a lecture to high-ranking officials, stressing that we must pursue the policy of Byungjin (which translates to the word 'tandem') in terms of nuclear and economic development. 'Mentioning that Hitler managed to rebuild Germany in a short time following its defeat in World War One, Kim Jong Un issued an order for the Third Reich to be studied in depth and asked that practical applications be drawn from it.' Mein Kampf is a mix of Adolf Hitler's biography with his political ideologies . I'm in charge: The report, from underground sources in the country, says Kim Jong-ll has taken on a more authoritarian tone of late . The threat to eliminate 'scum' so they will not be able to have an inch of land to be buried in was not made lightly. A general who had shown disobedience last year was lined up against a wall and blown to pieces by a mortar shell. Hitler's memoir, which translates as . My Struggle, was written in 1924 while he was being held in a prison in . Bavaria before he became Germany's leader. In it he strikes out against Jews who he said were conspiring to gain world leadership. Kim Jong-un toured North Korea's east coast last month in a 95-foot luxury yacht, a boat that could be prohibited under U.N. sanctions, a website that tracks events in the reclusive state said. The NK News website said the yacht, a Princess 95MY made by British-based Princess Yachts, was possibly a recent purchase by the leader of the impoverished pariah state. North Korea's KCNA news agency released a photograph of Kim on May 28 that showed him walking along a dock with henchmen. The starboard side of a luxury boat is visible to the right of the picture. Living it large: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un walks with his henchmen along a dock, with the starboard side of a luxury yacht that could be prohibited under UN sanctions clearly visible in the background . Will Green, sales director for Princess Yachts International, told NK News it suspected the boat was a 95MY. 'Given we launched the 95MY some years ago, many of them will have since changed hands on the private brokerage market,' said Mr Green, adding the company was looking into the matter. Princess Yachts is part of LVMH, the world's top luxury group by sales. An updated version of the 95MY, the Princess 98MY, sells for more than $8.7million (£5.6million), NK News said. New sanctions imposed in March in response to fresh nuclear tests included examples of luxury items North Korea could not import, such as yachts and racing cars. Measures aimed at crimping the lifestyle of the elite were first imposed in 2006 but until now they had never given examples of such goods, leaving it up to individual countries to decide what constituted a luxury product.",Pyongyang condemns leak as a 'thrice-cursed crime' aimed at belittling Kim .

It is an unavoidable downside to becoming the world's youngest billionaire. But international fame has forced Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to hire a 24-hour personal security team. Like many A-list celebrities, the 27-year-old is now so well-known that he has a bodyguard permanently parked outside his house in Palo Alto, California. Mr Zuckerberg's domestic security . arrangements have come to light after fellow online entrepreneur Drew . Houston, the founder of web-based file-sharing service DropBox, recalled . a recent visit to his home. Mr . Houston, 28, told Forbes magazine that the guard stationed outside Mr . Zuckerberg's property caused him to consider the pitfalls of . unparalleled success. He said: 'I'm not sure I want to live that life, you know?' With . a staggering fortune of $13.5billion, the Facebook CEO only treated . himself to the £7million five-bedroom Palo Alto house - his first home - . in May. The house is believed to be a 5,617 . square-foot property in the Crescent Park neighbourhood - a convenient . ten-minute drive from Facebook’s offices in Menlo Park. Until then, the computer genius had . been living in a relatively modest two-storey house on a street that . neighbours described as ‘absolutely average’. Mr Zuckerberg is sharing his new house with his girlfriend of seven years, Priscilla Chan. First home: The $7million property in Palo Alto that Mr Zuckerberg is thought to have bought in May . The 1903 home with its outdoor walls and trees offers far more privacy than his former 3,800 square-foot rented house. An entertainment pavilion with outdoor fireplace and built-in barbeque has been added along with a salt water swimming pool and spa. According to information from the estate agent earlier this year, a wide rocking chair porch at the front of home leads to an impressive entrance hall and reception area. There is a large living room, with a banquet hall sized dining room and . wood-panelled family room. The large kitchen opens into a glass sun . porch. The house has five bathrooms. Former home: The billionaire lived in this two-storey . rented house on a street that neighbours describe as 'absolutely . average' Unremarkable: One of the other rented homes that Mr Zuckerberg has lived in since moving to Palo Alto . Mr Zuckerberg has lived in Palo Alto, . California almost continuously since he moved Facebook to Silicon . Valley straight from his Harvard dorm room in 2004. Despite . the great success of the site, which now has 600million members, the . New York dentist’s son has always previously lived in rented houses. Tyler Winklevoss, one of the Harvard twins who claimed Mr Zuckerberg stole their idea for Facebook, was quoted as describing him as ‘the poorest rich person I’ve ever seen in my life’. Even with the move to the larger mansion, Mr Zuckerberg’s home is still dwarfed by those of his Silicon Valley rivals. Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison’s house is 8,000 square-foot and Microsoft founder Bill Gates lives in a home that is an impressive 66,000 square-foot.","The 27-year-old is now so well-known that he has a bodyguard permanently parked outside his house in Palo Alto, California ."

Formula One female test driver Susie Wolff has announced that she will appear in a BBC documentary this spring about her life as the only woman in F1. 30-year-old Susie, from Oban, Argyll, is tipped to become the only female racing driver in the sport and the film, The Fastest Woman In The World, follows her life and career as a test driver. Directed by her BAFTA-nominated . brother David Stoddart, 31, the film also features appearances from . Formula One race ace Lewis Hamilton and racing legend David Coulthard. Susie, who is a developmental driver for the Williams F1 team began go-karting when she was . eight and now lives in Switzerland with her husband, Austrian racing . driver Toto Wolff. She said: 'Shooting the film was one . of the hardest things I’ve ever done. I . '’m a fairly private person, so to . have my brother follow me for nine months, through some pretty . difficult times - let’s just say it was a big challenge.' David said: 'It was tough combining . the role of documentary maker and brother. I had to remind myself that I . was there to film Susie's story, but during the more difficult moments . my instinct as a brother kicked in. 'It was challenging at times to strike the balance, but it's a great story that needed to be told.' He . added: 'Susie was very open and honest, and I’m enormously grateful to . her for that, and for giving me a rare glimpse into life in Formula . One.' Other names to have driven for Williams in the past include Nigel Mansell, Damon Hill and Jenson Button. Susie . said: 'I don't race to prove how good women can be against men. 'I race . because it’s my passion and I hope this documentary will give an insight . into a very competitive world, in which I’ve been racing since I was a . young girl.' Susie is currently the only female driver in the sport and the film, directed by her brother and BAFTA-winning film maker, David, will follow her career in the traditionally male-dominated industry . 30-year-old Susie, who is married to Austrian racing driver Toto Wolff, is a developmental driver for the Williams F1 team . She revealed the news at the Circuit de Catalunya in Spain where she joined her Williams F1 teammates to launch Williams 2013 race car, the FW35 . As a test driver Susie is currently the only female driver in the sport after Spaniard Maria de Villota lost her right eye in a testing crash in July 2012. Speaking to the BBC as she drove a 2011 Williams race car at Silverstone following the accident Susie said: 'She told me to drive for us both now, that I would be out there representing us both. 'I had Maria's star on my helmet. It's with pride I have that and without doubt I was driving for the two of us.' She added: 'She is an incredible lady. Before you even talk about her as a racing driver, she is an incredible person, an inspiration. 'After the publicity surrounding Maria's accident without doubt I felt an extra need to go out there, do a good job and show that her accident was a freak one-off and it doesn't generalise women in motorsport.' Only five women have ever competed in Formula One, including Brit Divina Galica who failed to qualify for the opening two South American races in the 1978 competition. The last female to compete was Italian Giovanna Amati in 1992. Susie became the only female F1 driver after test driver Spaniard Maria de Villota lost her right eye in a testing crash in July 2012 .

This is the latest in a long line of achievements for one of the most prominent women in motorsport. Patrick posted a qualifying lap of 196.4mph in her number 10 Chevrolet, completing the 2.5mile-long route at the Florida superspeedway in 45.817 seconds on Sunday. She will line up alongside four-time Nascar champion Jeff Gordon on the front row of the grid this Sunday, for the first race in the 2013 Sprint Cup Series. The Daytona 500 is the series' most prestigious race - considered to be Nascar's equivalent of the Super Bowl. Before making the switch to Nascar, Patrick raced in the IndyCar series. Her Indy Japan 300 win in April 2008 made her the only woman so far to win an IndyCar race. In 2005 she was voted Rookie of the Year at the Indy500 after finishing fourth in the race. By 2009, she recorded the highest finish by a woman at the Indy500 when she finished third behind Helio Castroneves and the late Dan Wheldon. Sir Richard Branson tried and failed to woo her to Formula 1 to join his Virgin Racing team for the 2010 season.

Grief: Hasnat Khan has said he believes Princess Diana is still with him and that her memory has helped him to cope . Princess Diana’s former lover Hasnat Khan has told how he believes she is still with him and that her memory has helped him cope with this month’s release of a film about their relationship. The heart surgeon, nicknamed ‘Mr Wonderful’ by the princess, said the pair were ‘inseparable’ during their two-year romance and revealed he is still struggling to come to terms with her death 16 years on. He said her determination to help others through charity work has inspired him to embark on a surgical mission in Africa. Dr Khan said: ‘It’s been difficult for me to get my head around Diana’s death or talk about it.‘After she died things were difficult, very difficult. 'We all have our own traumas and get on with it. But when it’s there in your face year in, year out, it’s hard.’ Dr Khan is based at Basildon University Hospital but this month will be setting up a surgery in Ethiopia with charity Chain of Hope, which cares for children with heart conditions across the third world. He said: ‘Sometimes when I do a job like this I do have these very strong feelings that Diana is still with me somehow. ‘Not in a religious or spiritual sense, but in the way you feel when you’ve known someone really well in your life and instinctively know how they’d react in a given situation. ‘The past few weeks have been tough and I know Diana would be saying, “Stay focused and keep getting on with your life. Help these children. Be happy”. ‘I also know she would be proud of the sort of work we’re doing here in Ethiopia . ‘She was a great humanitarian and that’s how she should always be remembered.’ Dr Khan branded the movie Diana, starring Naomi Watts, a ‘betrayal’ of their relationship. He said: ‘I haven’t seen the film and I haven’t met anyone who has seen it, but I can tell you for sure that it’s based on a superficial idea. I have kept things very discreet, but now this film is trying to open things up again.’ And he said that contrary to claims in the film, his family never objected to their relationship. One scene depicts a supposed meeting between Dr Khan, played by Naveen Andrews, and one of his uncles, who encourages him to choose between marrying the princess and his Muslim family. 'Betrayal': Actress Naomi Watts as Princess Diana and Naveen Andrews as Dr Hasnat Khan in a scene from the film Diana released this year . Mr Wonderful: Hasnat Khan said the pair were ‘inseparable’ during their two-year romance . Dr Khan said: ‘Both my parents, grandmother and all close relatives who met Diana liked her very much and my parents and grandmother never objected to our relationship. ‘They were very much happy for us to make a decision ourselves and made it clear they would support it 100 per cent. We both had their blessing. ‘This amounts to the film projecting a betrayal of our relationship and my relationship with my immediate family... It’s all based on presumptions.’ Now 54, Dr Khan is single after an arranged marriage in 2006 ended in divorce. Friends said Diana wanted to marry Dr Khan but their relationship ended weeks before her death in a Paris car crash in August 1997. The film is based on Kate Snell’s 2001 book Diana: Her Last Love, which suggests that Diana was seeing Dodi Fayed, who died with her, to make Dr Khan jealous.","Heart surgeon said pair were 'inseparable' during their two-year romance .

A miniature donkey is being hand-reared by a farmer - and now follows her ‘mum’ everywhere she goes. Baby Hope, who is no bigger than a dog, was rejected by her real mother Tuppance when she was born on a farm in Carlisle a month ago. Farmer Jane Nelson whisked Hope away from her new mother after Tuppance started biting her and kicking her over. But the frightened foal survived after Ms Nelson hand-fed her goat milk in a baby’s bottle every two hours. The young donkey now thinks Jane is her mother. A mother's love: Rare 25-inch-tall donkey Hope survived rejection by her mother after farmer Jane Nelson, pictured, hand-fed her goat's milk from a baby's bottle every two hours. She thinks the farmer is her mother . Can I help with anything? Baby donkey Hope follows her new 'mother' everywhere, including the kitchen . Surrogate mother Jane Nelson, 49, said: 'She just puts her ears back and runs straight into your bottom' For a while it was touch-and-go for the rare Mediterranean donkey, but now Hope enjoys nothing more than charging at Jane’s bottom. At 25 inches tall, the miniature donkey is the same size as a Labrador and has become best friends with a Shetland pony called Dixey. Ms Nelson, 49, already keeps four alpacas, eight miniature Shetland ponies, another donkey and two cuny pigs at Floshes Farm in Carlisle, Cumbria. She said: 'It’s like having another child. 'She follows me around, she comes in the house and follows me around in the morning to skip about or be cheeky. 'She just puts her ears back and runs straight into your bottom - she’s quite a character.' There are only around 400 Mediterranean donkeys in the UK, and a female costs about £2,500. When fully grown the donkeys are no bigger than a Shetland pony. Going for a walk: At 25 inches high, miniature donkey Hope is smaller than some dogs . 'She’s just happy when she’s out messing about in the yard,' said her owner. 'If there’s people about she follows them, she loves people.' Hope’s mother Tuppance rejected another baby last year, and turned on Hope almost instantly after she was born on September 17. Ms Nelson said: 'Tuppance cleaned her up and licked her and then just stared biting her and knocking her over and we couldn’t leave her with her that night at all because she was born at seven in the evening. 'I was up every two hours throughout the night feeding her. 'I tried for a week to put Hope onto Tuppance to feed but every time she just wanted to kill her.' Despite the rejection, Hope has become a firm favourite on on the farm, said Ms Nelson. 'We put Hope with a one-year-old Shetland called Dixey,' she added. 'She’s young herself but she’s very gentle. 'She grooms Hope and looks after her - they’re happy together. 'They’re all looking after Hope - everybody loves her.'

The government may have announced this week it will ban khat, but in recent years shipments of the herbal stimulant have poured into the UK from Africa. One photographer who ventured into a khat packing factory in a deprived district of Nairobi, Kenya, has shared her images of the stimulant's journey from the city's backstreets to Britain, where it is popular among Somali communities. Celeste Hibbert documented Kenyan workers - who depend on UK sales for their welfare - wrapping up the plant into banana leaves and packing it into boxes. Workers: Kenyan labourers pack bunches of khat into banana leaves so they can be shipped to the UK . Export: The packing factory sends thousands of boxes of the stimulant to the UK every week . Labour: The export business is owned by Somali families who use Kenyan workers as they are cheaper . From just one packing depot in Eastleigh, Nairobi, 2,500 boxes of khat are flown to the UK four times a week. Khat, also known as cathonine, is . popular in parts of the Middle East and Africa, where users chew the . leaf to release stimulants that produce an amphetamine-like high. It has been banned in the US and most . EU states, with British Home Secretary Theresa May announcing this week . she would enforce a UK ban on khat - despite advice against the move by . an official advisory body. Khat 'houses' in Britain have been linked to terrorism, with police targeting those in Woolwich amid fears they are recruiting grounds for Islamic extremists. Mrs May's proposed ban means khat will be treated as a class C drug, like anabolic steroids and ketamine. Stimulant: Mohammed, a resident of Eastleigh, Nairobi, chews khat every day . Cheap: A bunch of the best quality khat is £27 ($40) but a bag of khat leaves can be bought for as little as 67p . Ban: Khat will be defined as a class C drug after Home Secretary Theresa May decided to ban it . Trade: Somali families monopolise the export of khat to Europe in Kenya. They create links with Somalis in UK and send initial supplies based on trust . Customers: Sacks of khat are delivered to local people in Eastleigh every afternoon . In Eastleigh, bundles of khat arrive every day at 2pm from a farm around 140 miles away in Meru. Much of it is bundled up and put into sacks for delivery locally. Known as 'Little Mogadishu', Eastleigh is a Somali suburb of Nairobi and khat is popular with locals. One local Kenyan trader said: 'I live outside, not here. Khat is more of a Somali thing, but I have to chew to show people (in Kenya) it is not a bad thing.' Four days a week thousands of boxes are flown to the UK, mainly for British Somali customers. Plant: Khat is a stimulant native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula . Wealth: International distribution of Khat is worth millions and run by individual Somali-Kenyan multimillionaires . Welfare: The Kenyan workers rely on the export of khat to Britain for their livelihoods . A bunch of best quality khat costs around £27 ($40) but bags of its leaves can be bought for just 67p. The export trade to Europe is . monopolised by Somali families, many of whom create links with Somali . customers in Britain and initiate deliveries based on trust.

An Albanian immigrant who has been forced to leave Britain after 12 years has spoken of his desperation to be reunited with his family. Edmond Danushi moved to the UK when he was just 18, but has been unable to meet his newborn daughter since moving back to his native country a year ago. His wife Theresa says she is struggling to cope without him, and has launched an appeal to the authorities to allow him to return to Britain. Couple: But Edmond Danushi, left, has been forced to abandon his wife Theresa, right, and return to Albania . Family: Mrs Danushi and her children (left to right) Aalissia, Keiren, Eli and Aaliyah can only communicate with Mr Danushi via Skype . Mr Danushi, 30, has been continuously renewing his visa for the past 12 years, and recently applied for 'indefinite leave to remain' so he could stay in his adopted home permanently. He says the Home Office advised him to return to Albania in August last year to get his papers in order - but new legislation means he is unable to re-enter the UK. He lost his job last Easter, meaning that for him to settle permanently his wife must have savings of at least £18,600, which she does not. The Danushis met in Worthing, Sussex in 2001, when they were both teenagers, and now live in South-East London with their children Eli, 10, Keiren, eight, Aaliyah, two, and 10-month-old Aalissa. Together: The couple have been married for a decade after meeting when they were teenagers . Fury: Mr Danushi, pictured talking on Skype, is not allow to stay in the UK because he and his wife do not have enough money saved up . 'It is a disgrace they have taken me from my wife and family,' Mr Danushi said via Skype from Albania. 'I am most hurt for my children who are forced to grow up without a father. 'No one can understand the pain I feel. The worst part is not having been there when my daughter was born, and not being able to hold her.' Mrs Danshi, 28, said: 'We have been together for 12 years and married for 10. We speak on Skype every day but his son won't talk to him because he gets too upset. 'My 10-year-old daughter Eli keeps saying, ""I want my dad."" He never claimed from the state, he always did a range of jobs.' She has been prescribed anti-depressants to cope with the stress of her situation, and says she has developed a skin condition. Distraught: The family say they are finding it difficult to cope without their father . 'There is so much I have had to cope with on my own,' she added. 'We have four kids and the youngest has never met her dad. 'The older ones have been referred for counselling because they've found it so hard to cope. 'Some people come to this country and abuse the system but he was never like that.' Heidi Alexander, the MP for Lewisham East, is helping the family with its troubles, and a tribunal to settle Mr Danushi's fate is set to be held in February next year. A Home Office spokesman said: 'We welcome those who wish to make a life in the UK with their family, work hard and make a contribution. 'But family life must not be established here at the taxpayer's expense.

Close: Prince Charles shares a laugh with Emma Thompson at a film gala in aid of the Prince's Trust, one of several keen interests for the future king . New interview: Prince Charles has spoken to TIME magazine about his life in a piece where his close friend Emma Thompson described dancing with him as being 'better than sex' TIME . says Charles fears that becoming king would mean he would be forced to . drop charity work and projects he has run all his life to be replaced . with 'joyless' duties. In an interview at his Scottish estate in the Highlands he said: 'I’ve had this extraordinary feeling, for . years and years, ever since I can remember really, of wanting to heal . and make things better. On the dancefloor: Prince Charles doing a tango with Adriana Vasile in Buenos Aires, Argentina in the 1990s . 'It’s my duty to worry about everybody and their lives in this country, . to try to find a way of improving things if I possibly can.' He . also paid tribute to the influence of his family and his 'wonderful . wife. And of course now a grandson, which is what this is all about', he . said. Prince Charles formed the The Prince’s Trust in 1976 to help young people on to the job ladder and explains why he set it up. 'A few people are lucky enough to know exactly what they want to . do. But there’s a hell of a lot of others who don’t really know and may . not be obviously academic, who suffer from low self-esteem,' he said. He also supports PRIME – The Prince’s Initiative For Mature Enterprise - set  save the spiralling number of over-50s shattered by redundancy from the scrapheap. His other pet issues include rural affairs, climate change, health and town planning. The piece, released today is made up of 50 interviews with people who know Charles, and describes him as a 'mass of contradictions'. 'Engaged yet aloof, indulged and deprived, a . radical at the pinnacle of Britain's sclerotic establishment, surrounded . by people but often profoundly alone,' editor-at-large Catherine Mayer writes. But It is Emma Thompson who gives the most effusive praise of the future king. 'Dancing with Charles, an old friend, is better than sex.' the star says. 'There’s a long history of relationships between Princes of Wales . and actors—not just actresses, not just the rude relationships as . [Charles] would say, though god knows I’ve tried. He wasn’t having any . of it.' Meanwhile the Prince of Wales and the . Duchess of Cornwall were given good wishes today ahead of their trip to . India and Sri Lanka next month. Charles and Camilla hosted a reception for members of British Indian and Sri Lankan communities at St James's Palace.

A disturbing YouTube video filmed on a New York subway in which a woman accuses a man of giving her AIDS has been revealed as a 'prank' posted by a New York City 'actress'. Every seasoned New Yorker has at least one subway horror-story, but the altercation between the man and woman would surely reach the top of the list for most. The premise of the prank is a woman getting into a fight with a man on the subway because he gave her AIDS. Scroll down for video . Subway horror: A bewigged Waters gets into a fight with her 'boyfriend', accusing him of giving her AIDs . Quite a performance: Zaida Waters describes herself as an actress - but fortunately not a comedian . The video was uploaded to YouTube earlier this week and has since been viewed more than 23,000 times. The end of the video flashes up with a Facebook page for a woman named Zaida Waters. That page contains is a link to the video, as well as many others, described as 'pranks'. Waters describes herself as an actress on her Facebook page and also has a YouTube channel full of other offensive pranks, including one in which she pretends to go into labor at Coney Island (complete with fake blood and gore) and one in which she spits on a man presumably in on the 'joke' and gets into a physical fight with him on a subway. For someone who professes to want to bring happiness to people's lives, Waters has strange way of going about it. 'Hey everyone,’ reads her YouTube channel description. 'Welcome to Msmuffin’s channel..if you like to watch comedy pranks, you’ve came to the right darn channel ;p..I hope you enjoy my videos... I wish the best to you all and stay strong ..and oh do me a big fav keep a smile on them beautiful faces, life’s too short to be stressing ;)..stay tooned you guys have a great day.' Full uncensored video can be seen here (WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT) In training: Passengers must listen to this couple scream obscenities during what must have seemed like the longest subway ride ever . At an early point in the latest video in response to the woman's violent shoving, the man says, 'What are you going to do now? You got AIDs, you can't do nothing about it... What, you going to give it to other people?' To which she responds, 'Yeah! I'm going to give it to him, and him, and him,' she says pointing out men around the packed carriage. Other people in the carriage appear upset and uncomfortable while the couple push and slap at each other and employ some colorful language. Confrontation: The fight continues apace (left) while a passenger tries to reason with the pair before giving up (right) The man calls the woman 'disgusting' and forcefully grips her arms as she accuses him of giving her AIDs and having a 'dirty d**k.' The script was decidedly lackluster, consisting mostly of, 'Get off me, you gave me AIDS,' from the woman, and 'You gave yourself AIDS,' from the man,interspersed with obscenities and physical violence. As if her idea of AIDS being comical didn't already let on, it appears Waters has a fundamental misunderstanding of the illness which, if she had indeed been infected, would have manifested as HIV and not full-blown AIDS. Bystanders: The man physically lifted Waters and tried to drag her bodily from the carriage . At risk: One brave woman stepped in to try and help Waters, unaware the pair were playing an elaborate and distinctly unfunny prank . An education: It's unclear what Waters intended viewers of her video to learn . As the six-minute-plus video progresses, the fight escalates to violent pushing and terrifying screaming and yelling. When the crowded train pulls into a station other passengers on the train gratefully move towards the doors as the couple continue their act. Suddenly, the man grabs the woman and begins to physically carry her from the carriage as she screams and holds onto the pole. Other passengers run to help and demand the man let go of her, which he eventually does. 'MsMuffin' published the video on her YouTube channel with the message, 'Let this be a lesson learned,' but it's unclear exactly what the viewer is supposed to glean from the video - except, perhaps, beware of the subway.","A YouTube video of a woman accusing a man of giving her AIDs was posted to YouTube earlier this week .

The Seil backpack allows cyclists to trigger a range of displays, including indicators, stop signs and even their own custom messages for particularly irritating drivers . Designer Lee Myungsu has been working on the bags since 2010, which he designed to try and make the roads a safer place for cyclists. The bags show the intentions of a cyclist as well as warning signs and messages . ‘The Seil Bag is designed in order to illustrate traffic signals such as the cruise signal, stop signal and emergency signal directly on the backpack,’ says Lee Myungsu, the Korean designer behind the project. He has been developing the idea since 2010, and has now launched a Kickstarter project to put it into production after winning a major design award. It uses a specially developed flexible LED display Mungsu says is also waterproof, so should survive British weather.

"By . Becky Evans . PUBLISHED: . 03:17 EST, 21 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:09 EST, 22 October 2013 . A British artist has created his own Hollywood-style Transformer out of a humble Ford Fiesta. Hetain Patel spent three months working on his first sculpture, in which he turned the car into a real-life 'robot in disguise'. The rear wheels of the Fiesta have been converted into the legs and feet of the squatting Transformer and the doors have been turned into long arms. Artist Hetain Patel has taken a 1988 Ford Fiesta and morphed it into a towering Transformer . Hetain Patel (left) worked with his father (right) on the three month project that explores identity . The artist was joined on the project by his father, whose job is to convert vehicles into hearses, and his engineer brother Pritum. Mr Patel said the work is more than just a reference to pop culture but explores the issues of identity, reality, fantasy and transformation. He said it reflects his identity as the son of an Indian immigrant and looks at the relationship between class, immigration and family. The artist, whose work is featured on his website, deliberately chose a 1988 Ford Fiesta for the sculpture as it was the first car he drove, aged 17. The car's number plate also almost perfectly spells out 'family', which was unintentional but 'perfect' for the work. Mr Patel said: 'Born in the UK to immigrant Indian parents, the passing of a car between 1generations provided me with my first taste of independence. Mr Patel chose the Ford Fiesta because it was his first car and the number plate is 'perfect' because it almost spells out 'family' 'Manufactured in England, this car stands as a symbol of working class Britain — a native body, albeit a metal one.' He said, as well as reference the Transformers franchise, the project also reflects his own family. As well as choosing a car that was personal to him, Mr Patel said the squatting pose was also a deliberate choice. Mr Patel wrote: 'Unlike the popular toys and films, however, the car here is not a high-powered sports car or truck transformed into a powerful warrior, but rather a small, inexpensive Ford Fiesta transformed into a human, calmly squatting. 'This posture is a recurring image in my work and forges a link between the lower classes in India and my immigrant family in the UK, both of whom sit comfortably this way. 'Naturally this introduces a tension in this sculpture between the seemingly submissive nature of the squat and, in this case, its oddly larger than life scale.' He said he chose the squatting position because it reflects how his father and many lower class Indians sit . Transformers were originally launched in Japan in 1984 and featured factions of alien robots, who can disguise themselves as cars of other electrical equipment, and struggle for peace or dominance. It has expanded into comic books, animation, video games and three Hollywood films, starring Shia LaBeouf. In his work Mr Patel has used them as a metaphor for a real life conflicts and struggles. He wrote: 'For me, these ""robots in disguise"" (as per the cartoon’s theme song) stand as a metaphor for the other, in a fantasy world where they can transform out of a marginal position into one of empowerment.'","Hetain Patel took three months to convert vehicle into squatting Transformer .
