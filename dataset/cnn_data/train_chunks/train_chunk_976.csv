"Expected: Kate's due date was widely reported as being Saturday, July 13, but reports today said the due date might actually be today . The world has been impatiently waiting for the royal baby to arrive, but it was claimed today the Duchess of Cambridge might not be overdue after all. Kate’s due date was widely reported as being last Saturday, July 13, but it has now been suggested that the official due date is actually today. The world's press has been camped outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in London for a fortnight to ensure they don't miss her arriving. And social media is continually awash with rumours that she has gone into labour. But the only confirmation from Kate has . been that she was due in ‘mid-July’, and last night a source claimed she was actually given . today’s date. This means the baby could arrive as far away as August 2, because expectant mothers are only usually induced if the baby is two weeks late. The . Royal source said: ‘A small number of staff at St Mary’s who might be . called upon when the Duchess gives birth were told they had to remain . teetotal for a month before the due date.’ Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, they added: ‘They were told the due date was July 19.’ William and Kate's private office at . Kensington Palace has refused to confirm the Duchess's exact due date, . although Kate herself let slip during a public walkabout earlier this . year that it is 'mid-July'. William . was said to have had a few days off from his job as an RAF Search and . Rescue pilot in Wales this week, which he was thought to have spent with . his wife at their Kensington Palace residence. Kate, . 31, stayed at the home of her parents Carole and Michael Middleton in . Berkshire last weekend, while William played in two long-standing . charity polo matches. Scroll down for video . The world's press has been camped outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in London for a fortnight . The Duchess of Cornwall dropped a . tantalising hint on Monday that the wait could soon be over, telling . well-wishers she expects the little boy or girl to arrive imminently. Camilla revealed during a visit to a . children's hospice near St Austell, Cornwall: 'We are all just waiting . by the telephone. We are hopeful that by the end of the week he or she . will be here.' However, on Wednesday the Queen appeared to suggest that the baby was already late. She told a 10-year-old schoolgirl on a trip to Cumbria: 'I would very much like it to arrive because I’m going on holiday . soon... I wish it would hurry up.' Thrilled: Fay Batey (left) asked the Queen: . 'Would you like the baby to be a boy or a girl?' To which the Queen . replied she would like the royal baby to 'hurry up' before she goes off . on holiday to Balmoral a week today . Magic moment: Fay Batey, 10, (with her back to the camera) asks the Queen her question whether she would like the Royal baby to be a boy or a girl on her trip to Cumbria . Outside the hospital are scores of people from all over Britain and the world, who are waiting for the royal arrival. Pat and Norman Bate took two months to . get to St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington because the retired fruit and . veg merchants travelled from their Liverpool home to London via . Britain’s canal network  at four mph. Their 55ft canal boat Ellie May, is moored just behind the royal . hospital, filled with bagfuls of cards and presents for the baby, and its cabin draped with bunting. ‘As soon as we heard Kate was pregnant, I . said that we should aim to get there for the birth, so we left home on . May 1,’ Mrs Bate said. ‘And we hope to be here as long as it takes. After . all, we’re not paying for a hotel.’ Dedication: Pat and Norman Bate who have sailed down from Liverpool on their narrowboat to be near the hospital for the royal birth. With a top speed of 4mph the journey took two months . Terry . Hutt is now in his second week of living on a wooden bench opposite the . street entrance to the Lindo Wing, St Mary’s private maternity unit. The . retired carpenter from  Cambridge has been a familiar fixture at major . royal events for years, always dressed head to toe in Union Jack clothes . beneath a Union Jack umbrella hat. The Royal Family, he says, know him . as ‘The Umbrella Man’. Terry, . 78, has been here so long that, a few days ago, he felt compelled to . take himself back to Cambridge for a bath and a change of clothes. He . then returned to London with enough spare Union Jack kit to last him as . long as it takes. ‘What’s another week?’ he says. ‘It’s not boring and it gives my wife a rest from me.’ NBC presenter Natalie Morales has been knitting a pink bootie live on NBC’s flagship Today programme. ‘I think it may be even bigger news at home than it is here,’ she said, adding: ‘Once Kate goes into labour,’ she says, ‘we’ll be sleeping . right here.’ Prime position: Terry Hutt, who has been living on a bench outside the hospital for over a week waits patiently . Royal baby fever may have gripped . much of Britain and indeed the rest of the world, but as one American . interviewer found out, not everyone is in a frenzy of anticipation. When . CNN anchor Christiane Amanpour asked Margaret Rhodes, the Queen's first . cousin and close friend, if she was excited about the baby, her answer . took the journalist by surprise. 'Not terribly,' admitted the 88-year-old, hooting with laughter. Scroll down for video . British sangfroid: The Queen's first cousin, 88-year-old Margaret Rhodes, says she is 'not terribly' excited about the impending birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's baby .

'Heir to the throne?' prompted Amanpour. 'History?' Eventually, possibly more to move on to more interesting topics than anything else, Mrs Rhodes conceded: 'Yes, all right. I'm prepared to be excited.' The US TV host . asked Mrs Rhodes, the youngest daughter of the 16th Lord Elphinstone . and his wife Mary Bowes-Lyon, sister of the Queen Mother, what sort of . life the baby, which will be third in line to the throne, would have. Mrs Rhodes said she hoped it would have 'just a jolly, happy, ordinary child's . life', something she said the Royal Family managed with the then Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret. She added: 'The king and queen in those days made an . enormous effort to give -- to keep their childhood sort of sacrosanct. I . mean, it was just a time for learning and enjoying.

"Alleged racist rants on Twitter about the England players who missed penalties against Italy are being investigated by police it has emerged. The messages were aimed at Chelsea defender Ashley Cole and Manchester United winger Ashley Young following their team’s defeat in the Euro 2012 quarter finals in Sunday night. The Football Association has launched a strong attack on any online abuse branding it 'appalling and unacceptable'. Solemn: Ashley Young, left, and Ashley Cole, right,  pictured after . England's defeat yesterday, have been hit with racist abuse for missing . penalties and police have confirmed they are investigating . Someone calling himself Steve, using . @Lapwnage as his Twitter ID, praised Italian star Andrea Pirlo, adding: . ‘He could give those two black m******* Ashley Young and Ashley Cole a . lesson or two.’ He said the two players were ‘worthless n******’ who ‘should be deported to Africa’. When other Twitter users condemned his remarks, he accused one of being a ‘smelly Paki’. ‘Steve’ later backtracked, saying: . ‘Just a joke, you guys need to relax, police know I was kidding around . and they won’t bother me hopefully.’ And in another message, he claimed . defiantly: ‘The police won’t bother me mate. I can assure you of that.’ However, West Midlands Police got in touch with the user telling him: 'Wrong. Your comments may constitute a public order offence.

"Nine people who illegally named a woman raped by a footballer were told to pay her just £624 each in compensation yesterday. The nine, who included a woman teacher, posted messages on Twitter and Facebook accusing the 19 year old of being a ‘money-grabbing slut’ who had made up the attack. Some are on benefits and will be able to pay the debt off at £6 a week – denying the teenager full compensation for two years. Last night the former Tory MP who reported the internet bullies to police said the judge’s lenient sentence ‘sickened her’. Fined but not jailed: Daniel Cardwell, 25, left, arrives at Prestatyn Magistrates' Court, where he and Paul Devine, 26, right, were fined for naming a woman raped by footballer Ched Evans . Court appearance: Gemma Thomas, 18, left, and Michael Ashton, 21, right, were among the nine condemned for making comments on social networking sites . ‘A teenage rape victim was insulted, . demeaned and named – and the perpetrators get fined just a few hundred . quid. The law must change to protect victims,’ said Louise Mensch. Sandra McNeill from Rape Crisis Leeds . said: ‘The fine is outrageous. The law, which protects the anonymity of . rape victims, needs to be adequately applied. ‘If somebody breaks the law they . should go to jail – and not be given paltry fines. Someone senior needs . to have a word with that judge.’ Arrested: Dominic Green, 23, was one of the nine held and later convicted over the naming of the victim . The teenager is said to have been . traumatised by the heated online discussion after Ched Evans was . convicted in April of raping her the previous May. The nine posted the messages about her . with ‘deliberate malice’ after the 23-year-old Wales and Sheffield . United striker was jailed for five years for the hotel room assault. The defendants appeared at Prestatyn . Magistrates' Court in North Wales charged with publishing material likely . to lead members of the public to identify the complainant in a rape . case. They claimed not to know that identifying a rape victim was a criminal offence. Policing the internet is proving a . challenge for constabularies and the case involving such a large group . is believed to be unprecedented. The offence – in a case which went to . the Attorney General for consent before charges were laid – carried a . maximum fine of £5,000. District judge Andrew Shaw rejected other sentencing options in favour of ordering the payment of compensation. Technically, this means the nine – . including a biology teacher, a cousin of the player and football . supporters – were not even fined. ‘Rape is a taboo in every civilised . society,’ said the judge. ‘It is viewed in this way because it is a . crime against women which subjects them to the most intimate personal . violation. ‘For reasons which I had thought were . within the common knowledge of most intelligent people in this country . we offer further protection for the victims of rape by prohibiting the . publication of their names and personal details.’ But Christopher Hutchins, a lawyer, said: ‘No fine can put back into the box the fact that the victim has been identified.’ Guilty: Benjamin Davies, 27, left, and Craig MacDonald, 26, right, were among the group who passed round comments such as 'money grabbing whore' about the victim . Shamed: Shaun Littler, 22, covers his face outside court, left, while Holly Price, 25, right, faced obscured by umbrella, is also publicity shy . He said the case sent a ‘public health . warning’ to all those who use social media and treat it ‘as a . conversation’ when it has a ‘far greater ability to spread virally and . cause serious harm’. Last night campaigner Jill Saward, who . was the victim of the Ealing Vicarage rape in 1986, said the punishment . should have been stiffer. Convicted: Footballer Ched Evans was found guilty of rape in April and today nine people admitted revealing the name of the victim online . ‘I don’t think it’s enough,’ she said. ‘It’s very difficult for victims to come forward when you are dealing . with celebrity cases. ‘Questions are raised about your . integrity and people will slag you off because you have made a claim . against someone who is famous. ‘Sentences need to be a lot stiffer than they currently are. It is not much of a deterrent.’ The judge told the offenders they had identified the victim, some with abusive comments and others with ‘deliberate malice’. He added: ‘You did so without proper knowledge of the facts and without any heed of the feelings of the victim. ‘Your actions have revictimised this . woman again. It is not for you to take the law into your own hands as . you did. In my view you best atone for what you have done by paying . compensation.’ He ordered them to pay a total of £5,616 in compensation as their only punishment. Nita Dowell, prosecuting, told the . court the case attracted a huge amount of interest nationally and . internationally and there were 6,000 mentions on Twitter. She said North Wales Police received . numerous complaints from members of the public and from groups such as . Rape Crisis about the victim’s treatment online. Holly Price, 26, a college biology teacher from Prestatyn, retweeted a comment calling the victim a ‘money-grabbing slut’. Price later told police that she had been an idiot and wanted to apologise to the victim. Admission: The nine said they didn't realise what they had done was a crime, Prestatyn Magistrates' Court heard . Star: Evans was an established striker with Sheffield United (pictured scoring against Swansea City) - and some of the people involved in naming the rape victim were Blades fans . Gemma Thomas, 18, a pub worker and . cousin of Evans from Rhyl, described the victim as a ‘money-grabbing . little tramp’ and ‘dirty slapper’. The maximum penalty for revealing the identity of a rape victim is just a fine. But other social media users who have broken different laws online have gone to jail. After . the footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed on the pitch from a heart . attack during a Bolton Wanderers match, student Liam Stacey, 21, was . sent to prison for inciting racial hatred over abusive texts. He was sentenced to 56 days in prison. Dominic Green, 23, also from the . player’s home town, named the victim on Facebook in what he accepted was . ‘an act of utter stupidity’. Jobless Paul Devine, from Sheffield, wrote . on Facebook: ‘She’s to blame for her downfall. Let’s find her address.’ His lawyer said the 26 year old had no intention of doing so and deleted the post four hours later. Jobless Benjamin Davies,  a 27 year old from Rhyl who was a friend of the footballer, made an abusive comment on Twitter. Michael Ashton, 21, of Llanddulas, Colwyn Bay, tweeted she had ‘cried rape’ and she ‘made him sick’. He removed the post after his law student girlfriend told him it was illegal. Shaun Littler, a 22-year-old hotel . receptionist and football fan from Sheffield, suggested on Twitter the . victim had ‘cried rape before’. He later told police he was ‘devastated’ that Sheffield United had lost Evans as a result of the trial because . he was the team’s best player. Another fan Daniel Cardwell, 25 and from Sheffield, told police he was drunk when he insulted the victim on Twitter. And jobless Craig MacDonald, 26, from Prestatyn, tweeted the woman was a ‘money-grabbing slut’.","As well as naming Ched Evans's rape victim, they also posted vile abuse - calling her a 'money grabbing whore' and a 'poor little victim'
Under British law no victim of rape or sexual assaults can be named but the maximum penalty is just a fine .
Some of the nine did not name her themselves, but 'retweeted' her identity, which was still enough to be convicted ."
"Millions of households could suffer interference with their television signal or even lose it entirely as thousands of 4G masts are switched on over the coming weeks. The company tasked with overseeing the launch of new super-fast mobile phone services has given companies the go-ahead to start their roll-outs in Greater London. Experts fear this will cause chaos with TV sets because three major operators would be able to use 4G signals on very similar frequencies to Freeview. Bad reception: Millions of households could suffer interference to their TV signal or lose it entirely when 4G masts are switch on over the coming weeks, experts warn . A source told The Daily Telegraph: 'From July, London is going to start to light up. 'By the end of the year, there could . be thousands of masts carrying 4G. The broadcasters in particular are . getting very jittery about this.' In postcards advising Londoners of the roll-out, at800, the industry-funded body responsible for steering the launch, insists only a 'small minority' of people are likely to be affected. But it admitted it has ordered in 'a few million' filters that concerned householders can fix to the aerial to remedy any interference. Ofcom, meanwhile, estimates that up to two million people could suffer nationwide due to the number and power of the 4G base stations. Interference? The company tasked with overseeing the launch of new super-fast mobile phone services has given companies the go-ahead to start switching on their 4G masts . New generation: 4G services, first rolled out by EE, offer download speeds at least five to seven times faster than those of existing 3G networks . The regulator warned in February that one per cent of UK households could be left with no broadcast television at all. Three operators - 02, 3Mobile and Vodafone - could be able to launch on the 800mhz frequency in London, close to the 700mhz used by Freeview, leading industry insiders to warn that some homes could lose sounds, pictures or even entire channels. Further launches will also be phased in throughout the country. Tests have been carried out by at800 in Brighton and York. EE - the only operator to have so far launched 4G packages - uses the 1800mhz frequency, well clear of the TV band. With the switch-over of TV services to digital, a band of frequencies previously used by TV is being made available for phone firms to offer high speed 4G services. In certain circumstances, it is possible that new 4G services at 800mhz could interfere with some existing terrestrial digital TV signals. This means viewers may need to fit a filter or, in around 40,000 cases, use cable or satellite providers. at800 spokesman Ben Roome, said: 'We are scaled up for anticipated problems. 'But so far in tests in south-east London, although we have received calls from lots of households, any problems they have been having with their television has not been caused by interference from 4G.' Satellite and cable TV services are unlikely to be affected by 4G at 800 MHz. For the typical user, download speeds of initial 4G networks should be at least five to seven times faster than those of existing 3G networks. EE, which was formed from the merger of Orange and T-Mobile, was the first company to offer a 4G network in the UK. It plans to extend the service to around 80 locations - and approximately 55 per cent of the UK population - by this month. Since launching 4G, the company said it had observed a 'huge shift' in the way people use mobile phones. This includes an increase in the number of consumers using video, maps and sat-nav tools.","Companies to roll-out super-fast mobile phone services in coming weeks .

"Humans have evolved to look physically different from each other because our eyes play such an important role in social interactions, research suggests. Most animal species use smell or sound to identify each other - but people rely primarily on sight to differentiate individuals. Many animals are visually almost indistinguishable from each other, particularly those which are active at night. Researchers from California compared DNA from around the world. They found genetic regions controlling facial features were more varied than those influencing other body parts. This indicated that facial variation in humans (left) has an evolutionary advantage, compared to other more identical-looking species (right) But humans have developed to be physically unique, according to the new research, giving rise to a wide variety in hair colours, eye pigmentation, height and facial features. Behavioural ecologist Dr Michael Sheehan, from the University of California at Berkeley, said: ‘Humans are phenomenally good at recognising faces; there is a part of the brain specialised for that. Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley compared DNA from around the world. They found that genetic regions controlling facial characteristics were more varied than those influencing other parts of the body. This was a clear sign that facial variation had an evolutionary advantage. Facial traits were also independent of each other, unlike most body measures. People with longer arms tend to have longer legs. But individuals with wide noses or widely spaced eyes do not have longer noses, for example. The most variable facial traits lie within the triangle of the eyes, mouth and nose, the researchers found. They assessed human facial variability with the help of a 1988 US Army database of personnel body measurements. ‘Our study now shows that humans have been selected to be unique and easily recognisable. It is clearly beneficial for me to recognise others, but also beneficial for me to be recognisable. Otherwise we would all look more similar.’ The scientists, whose findings are reported in the journal Nature Communications, showed that facial traits are much more variable than body features such as the length of the hand. Facial traits were also independent of each other, unlike most body measures. People with longer arms tend to have longer legs. But individuals with wide noses or widely spaced eyes do not have longer noses, for example. Comparing DNA from around the world showed that genetic regions controlling facial characteristics were more varied than those influencing other parts of the body. This was a clear sign that facial variation had an evolutionary advantage. Co-author Professor Michael Nachman said: ‘Lots of regions of the genome contribute to facial features, so you would expect the genetic variation to be subtle, and it is. But it is consistent and statistically significant.’ The most variable facial traits lie within the triangle of the eyes, mouth and nose, the researchers found. They assessed human facial variability with the help of a 1988 US Army database of personnel body measurements. Facial traits were also independent of each other, unlike most body measures. People with longer arms tend to have longer legs, according to the research. But individuals with wide noses or widely spaced eyes do not have longer noses, for example. These charts show the correlation between width and height of hands and noses . The scientists also used data from the 1000 Genome Project, which has catalogued nearly 40 million genetic variations among humans worldwide. ‘Genetic variation tends to be weeded out by natural selection in the case of traits that are essential to survival,’ said Prof Nachman. ‘Here it is the opposite - selection is maintaining variation. All of this is consistent with the idea that there has been selection for variation to facilitate recognition of individuals.’","Researchers from California compared DNA from around the world .

"Arsenal defender Mathieu Debuchy will be out for around three months following surgery on an ankle injury, manager Arsene Wenger has confirmed. Debuchy, signed from Newcastle for £12million in the summer, was taken off after catching his studs in the turf against Manchester City on September 13. It had been hoped the full extent of the injury would not prove severe, but the France full-back now faces an extended spell on the sidelines. Mathieu Debuchy looks anguished after suffering ankle ligament damage against Manchester City . Debuchy was clearly distraught as he was lifted onto a stretcher at the Emirates stadium . Speaking to Arsenal Media, Wenger said: 'He had surgery on Friday and will be out for three months. A reasonable delay is three months. 'All went well, but it can be a week or two earlier or a week or two later, but it will be around three months. 'It is a blow of course, how big it will be we will only know afterwards because it will be down to how well we replace him. We bought (Calum) Chambers for that.' Chambers is, along with Hector Bellerin, expected to feature for Tuesday night's Capital One Cup tie against Southampton at the Emirates Stadium. Wenger intends to utilise his squad for the clash against the Saints, who are second in the Barclay Premier League following their win at Swansea.

'Tomorrow night you might see Hector Bellerin, Francis Coquelin and Isaac Hayden. In the squad, we also have Chuba Akpom and Semi Ajayi as well. These are the players that are the closest,' said Wenger. The Arsenal manager also confirmed Nacho Monreal and Yaya Sanogo were still not match-fit, while England forward Theo Walcott should return after the international break from the knee injury which ruled him out of the World Cup. Wenger is confident 18-year-old Akpom, who impressed during spells at Brentford and Coventry last season, has the needed attributes to make an impact at the top level. 'I am happy that he has developed as a goal scorer, because when he was a younger kid, his problem was finishing. That has gone now,' said Wenger. 'He is a very good finisher and he has now to learn the tactical side of his game. Then he will be ready, because he is a huge talent.' The Gunners will have to rely on 19-year-old defender Calum Chambers as their only established right back . As well as Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Chambers is another Southampton Academy graduate now in the Arsenal squad. Wenger has been impressed by the calibre of players produced by the south coast club, who also schooled the raw talents of Real Madrid star Gareth Bale. 'I think if you look at the talents they have sold over the years, they could have been contenders to win the Premier League because they lost Oxlade-Chamberlain, Walcott, Bale plus all the players they lost last season, plus all the players they still have. They have done a fantastic job at Southampton, they deserve a lot of credit,' said Wenger. Youngster Daniel Crowley (centre) is put through his paces by Wenger (right) on Monday . Arsenal have been left short of defender as Nacho Monreal (centre) is also out until mid-October . The Gunners boss has been impressed by the achievements of Ronald Koeman, who took over a difficult job in the summer following the departure of former boss Mauricio Pochettino to Tottenham as well as the sale of several key men. 'They are miracle workers at Southampton and you must say everybody expected them to collapse, they lost the spine of their team, they lost their manager and they bounced back in a such a way,' added Wenger, whose side put recent inconsistencies behind them with an impressive 3-0 win at Aston Villa on Saturday. 'I must say when I saw them against Liverpool where they lost the game, I thought straight away that this team is very strong and very good.' Click here to like Sportsmail's Arsenal Facebook page .

"One of the FBI's most wanted men is believed to be hiding out among Mormon church members, the agency has said. Jason Derek Brown, 43, is being sought in the fatal shooting of an Arizona armored truck courier in 2004. The FBI is offering $100,000 for information on him. The one-time Salt Lake City resident and Laguna Beach native could be taking advantage of philanthropic Mormon church members to remain at large, the FBI's lead agent on the case said. Scroll down for video . On the run: Jason Derek Brown has been wanted by the FBI since 2004.  He is pictured, right, around the time of the alleged murder and left, with age progression of what he might look like today . The FBI believe Brown could have targeted Mormons because he once was a devout follower of the religion and could easily integrate. He served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in France in 1988 after being ordained into the religion by his grandfather. Although he returned to his native Laguna Beach after the mission, got married and lived the LDS lifestyle, he is believed to have abandoned the church in the Nineties. He left his wife and became interested in fast cars, nightclubs, women and alcohol, running up thousands of dollars in debt, according to the dailybeast.com. Blending in: With his 'surfer dude' persona and generic name, Brown has evaded the FBI for eight years . Brown is accused of shooting Robert . Keith Palomares five times in the head at close range with a .45-caliber . handgun on November 29, 2004, outside a Phoenix theater. The last confirmed sighting of Brown, a former toy salesman, was in August 2008. A . friend spotted the fugitive at a stoplight near the Hogle Zoo in Salt . Lake City, where he lived just months prior to the murder. Brown bought a handgun at a Kearns gun store two weeks before the crime and the weapon was later linked to Palomares' death. He is a skilled liar and convincing people that he's someone else. He could be taking advantage of a Mormon church member's philanthropy and be using an alias, FBI Agent Lance Leising said. Leising said Brown's ability to blend in is one reason he's on the Top 10 Most Wanted list. 'With the commonness of his name and how he looks, like a surfer dude in California, we've had more tips (about this) fugitive than any other on America's Most Wanted. 'It's caused us to chase leads all around the world,' Leising said. Brown has an uncanny resemblance to the actor Sean Penn - a fact that once led to the actor's body double being arrested after police thought he was Brown. He later earned a master's degree in business, started two companies and is fluent in French. An Arizona arrest warrant was issued in 2004 charging Brown with first-degree murder and armed robbery. Brown was later charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution in a federal arrest warrant. The matching fingerprints came from an application Brown submitted weeks earlier in Utah for a concealed-weapons permit. Utah authorities held the license because of the shooting and it was never issued. The fugitive is 5'10' and weighs 170-180lbs, with blond hair and green eyes. Although it is suspected he is in Utah and was last seen in Salt Lake City, other possible locations include Mexico, Laguna Beach, California and the west Coast of Canada where he has been known to vacation in the past. Fast-living: Brown was once a clean-living Mormon but descended into a life of drugs, women and fast cars . Often seen: The FBI said that the hunt for Brown has lead them all over the world .","Jason Derek Brown, 43, 'shot dead armored truck driver in 2004'

"Shawn Bair, the 22-year-old gunman who shot two women at an Indiana grocery store on Wednesday night, was a serial killer-obsessed loner who had suffered drug problems according to a friend of one of his victims. The killer's two victims have been named as 20-year-old Krystie Dikes, a supermarket employee who knew Bair, and a 44-year-old shopper called Rachelle Godfread. Natasha Sellers, 22, a friend of Dikes, told The Elkhart Truth that she believed her friend had known Bair and that he had suffered from problems with drugs. Scroll Down for Video . Shawn Bair, 22, walked into Martin's Super Market in the city of Elkhart, Indiana, on Wednesday night and shot two women before cops killed him . ‘I . did know him. He dated one of my friends in high school. He always . seemed like a really nice guy,’ she said. ‘I had heard he had a few . drug problems, but I never would have thought of this.’ According . to Sellers, Dike had only moved back to Elkhart in November after spending . the past year living in Muncie. Both were Elkhart Central High School . graduates. The son of Bair's second victim, Joe Godfread, posted on . Facebook on Thursday: 'For those who don’t know, my mom . was shot and killed last night at a grocery store. R.I.P. Rachelle . Godfread we love you.' According to local county court records, Bair had a criminal record and had been convicted of several petty criminal offenses. The killer's first victim has been named as 20-year-old Krystie Dikes, a supermarket employee who knew Bair . In 2009, he was convicted of possession of a controlled substance, a Class D felony, and misdemeanor marijuana possession, receiving 12 days of jail time altogether and additional suspended jail sentences. In 2010, he was sentenced for theft, also a Class D felony, receiving an 18-month jail term with 12 of those months suspended. He was also ordered to pay $5.89 in restitution to Martin’s Super Market, although the incident occurred at a different store from where the shootings occurred. According to court records, Bair was ordered to obtain 'addictions assessment... and follow-up' as part of his sentence in that matter. He also received an 'order of commitment' and, after a probation violation, another commitment order. 'If the (defendant) becomes involved in the outreach program as directed by Oaklawn as well as attends individual therapy and obtains a primary doctor or nurse practitioner,' the court records said, 90 days jail time in the probation violation would be suspended. Oaklawn Psychiatric Center is a psychiatric treatment facility based in Goshen, Indiana. Bair's second victim was a 44-year-old shopper called Rachelle Godfread . Bair's Facebook page gives a clear indication that had an interest in serial killers and scenes of violence. His profile photo is a man holding an axe under another man’s throat as two young girls look on in shock. His Facebook listings contain quotes about violence and death attributed to notorious serial killers such as Ted Bundy, Richard Ramirez, H.H. Holmes and Gary Ridgeway, as well as several serial killers’ mugshots. He had also 'liked' pages . included the National Rifle Association, National Association for Gun . Rights, Serial Killer Central and God. Since August 2011, Blair had been relatively quiet on the social media forum, but one of his final comments from just before he stopped posting was: 'I may be going to hell but at least I'm going honest and you know what that's all I've even been you look at me and see this freak I see a God because I embrace my fucked up side.' Officials visited Elkhart's home on Thursday morning to collect evidence and are looking into his criminal background for clues. 'He was going to the store with a mission,' said Indiana State Police spokesman Trent Smith. Martin's supermarket in Elkhart, which was flanked by police and fire officials after a shooting last night claimed three lives, including that of the gunman . Bair's Facebook page includes this photo, right, of the killer plus quotes from serial killers such as Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer and John Wayne Gacy . Smith said it was a 'huge crime scene' and that shots had been fired from one end of the store to the next. The . victims were found 10 to 12 aisles apart. Bair is believed to have walked to the store from his home and entered at about 9:30 p.m. on Wednesday. He then walked around for 30 or so minutes before the first shooting occurred, that of Dikes, at around 10:05 p.m. Then Bair headed toward another employee and confronted her. She ran and Bair shot in her direction, but the bullet missed. Meanwhile, the initial call about the incident went into authorities at around 10:07 p.m. After . shooting at and missing the Martin's employee, Bair shot a 44-year-old . woman, a customer in the store and the second fatal victim, Smith said. Subsequently, Bair located the store manager and held him hostage, apparently, pointing a gun at him and taunting him. A large knife was also found near Bair's body inside the supermarket . Elkhart police, by that time, arrived on the scene. When Bair saw them, he ran. The manager ran as well, exiting the store. Shortly thereafter, Elkhart police shot and killed Bair, according to authorities. No motive has been established so far, . but officials are looking into a possible connection between Bair and . one of the victims. Two police officers, who were on a routine call nearby, were able to quickly respond to the scene, Smith said. No other people were injured, . which Sgt. Smith credited to the . prompt response by the police officers. He said: 'The . quick action of the Elkhart City Police Department responding to this . active shooter undoubtedly saved several lives tonight.' The Indiana State Police will investigate because the Elkhart Police Department was involved in the shooting, Smith said. The shooter was pointing his gun at a third person when the officers found him in a store aisle . 'We do have a lot of things to look at as far as video surveillance,' Smith said, noting that state and city police were also interviewing witnesses. Martin's Super Market posted a statement on its Facebook page, saying: 'Thank you to our community for your thoughts and prayers tonight. We will comment further when we can do so responsibly and appropriately.' Elkhart is in far northern Indiana, just south of the Indiana-Michigan border, and about 15 miles east of South Bend.","Shawn Bair, 22, opened fire in Martin's supermarket in Elkhart, Indiana, on Wednesday night before being shot by police .

"Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil accepts he will always be an easy target for the critics and says he has nothing to prove to anybody. The German World Cup winner answered the growing doubters with a masterful display in the 3-0 demolition of Aston Villa on Saturday. He swept in the opening goal and created the second for Danny Welbeck at Villa Park when deployed in a more central role by Gunners boss Arsene Wenger. The 25-year-old has continually found himself under scrutiny since becoming Arsenal's £42million club record signing from Real Madrid on deadline day in September 2013. Mesut Ozil scored his first goal of the season during an excellent display away to Aston Villa on Saturday . Arsenal's German superstar also provided an assist for new striker Danny Welbeck as his side won 3-0 . However, Ozil is not about to let anyone else's opinion get in the way of his continued progress with the Gunners. 'I don't play to prove anything to anybody, I play for Arsenal,' Ozil told German news agency DPA. 'I have the feeling that I am criticised more, that happened to me in the Bundesliga and also at Real Madrid. 'We have only just started the season (at Arsenal), we have new players in key positions. Ozil looked back to something like his brilliant best as his dismantled Aston Villa from his free role . The Gunners' midfielder says he knows his own ability and has nothing to prove to critics . Ozil had been widely criticised for a poor start to the season, particularly after Arsenal lost in Dortmund . 'The collective game, which is something I have a lot to do with, cannot then just work well from one day to the next.' Ozil added: '(Just) 10 weeks ago I was elected to the team of the season in England (via an internet poll on the Premier League website). 'I was world champion then. It was the summer break and after a few games (of the new season) everything is called into question again. This is strange, but I know what I can offer.' Ozil says he can't understand the criticism so early in the season after winning the World Cup . Ozil played every game in Brazil, scoring once, as Germany won the World Cup this summer . The playmaker believes his role is as part of Arsenal's 'collective game' and that will take time to gel . Ozil is likely to be one of several first-team players rested by Wenger for the Capital One Cup tie at home to Southampton on Tuesday night, but should again be the key man for Saturday's north London derby against Tottenham at the Emirates Stadium. The cup tie could see a debut for Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina, who has yet to feature apart from on the bench after regaining fitness following a summer move from Nice. Costa Rica forward Joel Campbell may be another deployed against the Saints, along with fit-again midfielder Abou Diaby.","Arsenal playmaker scored one goal and made another in 3-0 win .

"With a car boot full of fizzy drinks, crisps and sweets, it is hardly surprising that he is popular with pupils. But parents and teachers are furious at the mobile trader who has set up shop at the gates of their school. They accuse him of shamelessly cashing in on their children’s appetite for junk food – and in one of the worst areas for childhood obesity in the country. Cashing in: The unnamed trader has converted his Suzuki Wagon R into a fully-stocked sweet shop. He parks the customised vehicle outside Ellis Guilford School in Nottingham every morning . Using his people carrier as a . makeshift shop complete with signs and a till, the trader was selling . 500ml bottles of fizzy drinks for 50p and bags of crisps for 30p – . around half the price  of shops. But his days of dubious enterprise could be numbered. The . local council is considering outlawing him from the vicinity of the . school after receiving complaints from parents. Ellis Guilford School in . Nottingham, catering for 1,350 children aged 11 to 16, is in an area . where a staggering 40 per cent of teenagers are overweight. Parent . Richard Glaves, 40, said: ‘You see in the news about children getting . fat because of chocolate, crisps, that sort of thing, and this man is . ruthlessly exploiting that. Sour taste: Teachers say the man is exploiting teenagers in an area where 40% are obese . ‘It’s . disgusting the way he is deliberately targeting children when he knows . their parents will not be looking. To me, it’s no different than a drug . dealer peddling drugs to addicts. He must see overweight pupils and . think he’s quids in.’ Schools in the area have also reportedly had problems with vans selling chips, burgers and kebabs. Parent and school governor Henrietta Robinson said yesterday: ‘I don’t want my children exposed to these traders. ‘My . children say there are often mega-queues, often snaking out on to the . road, and they know some students have to run off the road because . traffic is coming. ‘My . children also say they have heard that some students are often late to . classes, as the trader will always stay until the last student is . there.’ Headteacher Sally . Coulton, said: ‘We have an issue with a tuck shop van parking outside of . the school gates at the start and end of the day.  I have had numerous . conversations with the owner of the van about the issues that he is . causing.’ Nottingham City Council has now said it will ban the man from operating outside the school gates. Councillor . Alex Norris said: ‘It is worrying the easy access that schoolchildren . have to junk food outside the school gates, and that they are . potentially spending their dinner money on fizzy drinks and chocolate . bars instead of, or on top of, a balanced school meal. Cheap: The man sells 500ml bottles of fizzy drinks for 50p and bags of crisps for 30p, half the price they can be bought for in shops. The prices attract hundreds of pupils every morning . Crowds gather: Parents say their children form 'mega queues' beside the vehicle, which often snake into the street. There are calls for the man to be banned from selling sweets anywhere near the school . ‘It’s . up to all of us, including schools and parents, to make sure . schoolchildren are making better choices about what food and drink they . choose.’ The trader refused to comment. The . scenario carries echoes of one at Rawmarsh Comprehensive School near . Rotherham, where mothers delivered fast food to children in defiance of . Jamie Oliver’s 2005 healthy school meals campaign.","The unnamed trader has converted his Suzuki Wagon R into a sweet shop .

"Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe’s loyalists have paid tribute to Kim Jong Il, describing the 69-year-old North Korean despot as a ‘lovely man’, who ‘was chosen by his people and regularly conducted elections’. Didymus Mutasa, the secretary of administration for Mugabe’s Zanu-PF party, told Zimbabwe state radio: ‘He was our great friend and we are not ashamed of being associated with him.’ The . dead North Korean leader was involved in the training and equipping of a . para-military group in the African country in the early 1980s. Popular leader: A loyalist of Robert Mugabe, left, paid tribute to the dead Korean leader Kim Jong Il, as his son, Kim Jong Un, right, prepared to assume dual control of the country with his uncle . Mugabe . sought help to train the infamous Fifth Brigade unit - which killed . almost 20,000 people in an operation named Gukurahundi, meaning the . first rains that wash the chaff. It has since been described as genocide. Kim Jong Il played an instrumental role in training the crack special killer unit that operated outside normal Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) command. But Methuseli Moyo, spokesman for the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (Zapu), which was at the receiving end of the massacres, said his party had 'no option but to welcome' the demise of the dictator. Jang Song Thaek, who will share power with his nephew, Kim Jong Un, and the military . He said: 'We will not shed any crocodile tears for the trainer of Gukurahundi, the only problem about his death is that it was before he could account for his actions, we are not apologetic about that.' Meanwhile, in Cuba citizens are observing three days of mourning in a show of solidarity for its fellow communist state. Following his father's death, North Korea's new young leader will be Kim Jong Un, who will rule the country alongside his uncle and the military, sources it was revealed today. Jang Song Thaek will work alongside his inexperienced and untested 28-year-old nephew - the first time since the end of World War Two a collective rather than a dictator from the family dynasty will be in charge. The army's backing of Kim Jong Il's third son, his proclaimed successor, has also calmed fears there could be a military coup. And it has prompted speculation there . will now be a smooth transition of power - meaning little change for the . millions of impoverished and poverty-stricken citizens. A . source also revealed that the test-firing of a North Korean missile on . Monday, following the announcement of Kim Jong Il's death on Saturday, . was a warning shot against the U.S. The source said: 'With the missile test, North Korea wanted to deliver the message that they have the ability to protect themselves. 'But North Korea is unlikely to conduct a nuclear test in the near future unless provoked by the United States and South Korea.' Jang Song Thaek's appointment was widely . expected after his addition to the National Defence Commission, the . supreme leadership council led by his brother Kim Jong Il as head of the . military state, in 2009. Collective: North Korean soldiers are continuing to mourn for Kim Jong Il . Lying in state: The woman was pictured during footage of tributes being paid to North Korean leader Kim Jong Il at the Kumsusan Memorial Palace in Pyongyang . Mysterious: One of a select few images of Kim Jong Il with any members of his family, but no sign of his daughters . UN food experts urged immediate food aid for the isolated nation just months before Kim Jong Il's (pictured) death. Three groups described the urgent need for food, reporting 'acute malnutrition' among North Korean children, 'widespread consumption of grass' and elderly people on a 'knife edge'. There was 'substantial evidence' of a growing food crisis for millions who live in the countryside - beyond the relative comfort of Pyongyang. 'What we saw was extensive chronic malnutrition and cases of acute malnutrition, which is where the person is basically dying,' said David Austin, director of North Korea's Mercy Corps. He added: 'More than 50 per cent of people who are reliant on (state-provided grain) were out seeking out alternative food - things like bark, wild grass, and leaves - and mixing it in with food. We found there was no protein or fat in people’s diets.' And when he returned in September, government grain rations had been cut by more than half to about 150 grams per day - the equivalent of one potato. Alongside Kim Jong Il's younger sister Kim Kyong Hui, he is expected to guide the 'young general' during his formative days in power. As part of the consolidation of power, security was stepped up in cities and troops put on high alert as South Korean activists launched giant balloons containing tens of thousands of propaganda leaflets across the border. Some showed graphic pictures of former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi's battered corpse and described his gruesome death. They oppose a hereditary transfer of power in North Korea - where Kim Jong Il ruled for 17 years after inheriting power from his father, national founder and eternal North Korean President Kim Il Sung, who died in 1994. And in another sign of border tension, Chinese boatmen along a river separating North Korea and China said North Korean police ordered them to stop giving rides to tourists, saying they will fire on the boats if they see anyone with cameras. Meanwhile, the young Kim on Tuesday led a procession of senior officials in a viewing of Kim Jong Il's body, which is being displayed in a glass coffin near that of Kim Il Sung. Publicly presiding over the funeral proceedings was an important milestone for his successor, strengthening his image as the country's political face at home and abroad. State media showed video of Kim Jong Un receiving mourners, including foreign envoys, as he stood near his father's body with an honour guard. He was sombre during the greetings, although footage at one point showed him teary-eyed. A report in the North's official Korean Central News Agency did not specify which foreign countries the envoys represented. According to official media, more than five million North Koreans have gathered at monuments and memorials in the capital since the death of Kim Jong Il. Hundreds of thousands visited monuments around the city within hours of the official announcement that Kim had died. The . North has declared an 11 day period of mourning that will culminate in . his state funeral and a national memorial service on December 28 to 29.

"Tory defector Douglas Carswell is on course to romp home as Ukip's first Member of Parliament, a new poll suggested last night. A survey of more than 1,000 voters in the Essex constituency of Clacton put support for Mr Carswell - who quit as its Conservative MP last week to stand for Ukip - on 56 percentage points, well ahead of the Tories on 24 points. Labour is on 16 points while the Liberal Democrats are on a miserable two percentage points, according to the poll commissioned by former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft. Douglas Carswell (right) sent shock waves through Westminster last week by announcing he was joining Ukip . Lord Ashcroft said: 'Even allowing for some movement in vote shares as the campaign unfolds, the likely outcome is clear. 'What happens to the seat at the general election seven months later is rather less settled. As things stand, the indication is that Carswell could hold the seat, but perhaps with a reduced majority.' The Conservatives have decided to get the contest over with as quickly as possible - announcing yesterday that it will take place on October 9, which is David Cameron's 48th birthday. Mr Carswell, speaking in detail about his decision to defect, said the final straw came when he attended the Konigswinter Conference in Cambridge, an annual meeting of senior German and British policymakers, where he heard senior Whitehall officials pouring scorn on Mr Cameron's plan to claw back powers from Brussels. 'I was shocked, I thought the Government was serious about change. And I sat in rooms listening to some very senior people, who unlike me are not democratically accountable, who clearly decide things, and who were just contemptuously dismissive,' he told the ConservativeHome website. 'They were smirkingly, eyeball-rollingly contemptuous of even the most modest treaty reforms.' After Mr Carswell's deal with party leader Nigel Farage (left), a poll suggests he'll win a by-election in Clacton . However, Mr Carswell's potential differences with senior figures in Ukip emerged as he argued with one supporter who suggested the NHS was being exploited by immigrants. 'Remember the Olympics, the [multicultural] opening ceremony, I don't know about you but that made me feel so good about this country,' he told the voter. 'We were all together and we've got to have that sense of we're all together.' Later, out of earshot of the Ukip supporter, he told his interviewer: 'I dislike that nativism.' Last night Mr Cameron told a meeting of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers to focus on the 'big issues'. London mayor Boris Johnson (left) has brushed off suggestions he rejected a plea to stand in the by-election, which falls on the birthday of Prime Minister David Cameron (right) The Prime Minister said: 'Let's go down to Clacton, do the job, fight for every vote. The future of our country lies in who can best run the economy.' The Tories are considering a fullscale open primary - in which anyone in the constituency could vote - to choose their candidate to take on Mr Carswell. It would embarrass the defector, who has previously supported their use but has been imposed on the local Ukip association. This triggered a furious response from Roger Lord, its existing general election candidate. London Mayor Boris Johnson brushed off suggestions that he rejected a request from Tory HQ to fight the seat. He said he had already 'whacked in the CV' for the west London constituency of Uxbridge.","Douglas Carswell caused shock in Westminster by defecting to UKIP .
Poll in Clacton, Essex suggests he will easily win coming by-election .
Win would make him first Member of Parliament for Nigel Farage's party .
Result would be setback for David Cameron and his policies on the EU ."

No hazardous chemicals were on the premises, Kanger said. One 50-year-old man taken was . taken to hospital in a critical condition and was described as suffering . from possible hypothermia, according to Omaha.com. Paramedics said the man had been submerged in cold water after an object fell on him. At least one other man was being treated by hospital workers after inhaling limestone dust. The Nebraska Medical Center was treating four men who work at the plant, according to spokeswoman Jenny Nowatzke: a 37-year-old with a collapsed lung, a 38-year-old with minor injuries, a 50-year-old with hypothermia, a 30-year-old with minor injuries. In addition, a firefighter that arrived at the scene needed stitches in a hand. Three patients sent to Alegent Creighton were listed in critical, serious and fair conditions.

Some had received cellphone calls and texts from their loved ones inside who told them one or two people may be missing or trapped. Kari Cook struggled to fight back tears as she waited for news on her boyfriend, John Broderick, a 53-year-old shift supervisor. He sent her a text at 10.09 am saying: 'Major accident. I'm hurt and trapped. Love you.' Cook thought Broderick was joking. 'Honey, answer me,' she replied. He never responded.

'They're all friends there.' Larry McElhinney, a driver with Curry's Transportation Service Inc. of Muscatine, Iowa, was making a delivery to International Nutrition when the explosion happened. He said he was sitting in his truck just outside the plant when he heard debris hitting the roof of his cab and saw dust flying. 'The next thing I knew the wall was caving in,' he told The Journal Star. 'I just got out of the truck and went out where everybody else was at.' According to International Nutrition's website, the company has operated globally for more than 20 years and in the United States for more than 40, working with animal health distributors, feed manufacturers and producers. An Occupational Health and Safety Administration report indicates a worker died at the plant on Aug. 30, 2002, after falling into a 5-foot deep by 20-foot long mixing tank that had an auger conveyor running through the center of it. The machine was running while the worker cleaned it, and he was mutilated by the moving auger conveyor and killed, the OSHA report says. Normal procedure for cleaning the tank required that it be locked out and the person washing it to jog the auger conveyor to clean all surfaces. The company paid $13,600 to settle seven related OSHA complaints. In 2012, the company paid more than $10,000 to settle half a dozen OSHA complaints informally for a variety of alleged safety violations. The categories included storage, first aid availability, safety guards on machinery, hand-power tool protection and electrical systems coverings.

"The High Court in Dublin has dismissed an application to extradite a senior Irish Republican Army veteran wanted in the U.S. over alleged links to a North Korean counterfeiting plot. Seán Garland, from Navan, County Meath, has been fighting extradition from the Republic of Ireland since his arrest in Dublin in 2009. Authorities in the U.S. want the 77-year-old former IRA adjutant-general to face charges over distribution of high-quality counterfeit U.S. dollars produced in North Korea. IRA veteran Sean Garland outside the High Court in Dublin. A U.S. application to extradite him has been dismissed . Garland had previously absconded on bail from Northern Ireland, which remains under British jurisdiction, when facing extradition on the same charges in 2005. High Court Justice John Edwards said today that he will explain his reasons for refusing the U.S. extradition request on January 13. A Marxist, Garland was one of a generation of IRA leaders who attempted to introduce a left-wing political agenda into the organisation. He became a key figure in the Official Irish Republican Army after its split from the Provos at the beginning of the Seventies, and rose to the position of president in Sinn Féin, the militant group's political wing, which was subsequently renamed the Workers Party under his direction. The U.S. Justice Department indictment accused Garland of circulating North Korean counterfeit $100 bills in the Nineties. According to some estimates, one in 10,000 U.S dollar bills is a 'superdollar' counterfeit. So called because of the calibre of the forgeries, the name derives from the fact that their quality exceeds that of real dollar bills. The notes are said to be made with the high quality ink printed on a cotton/linen blend using the intaglio and typographic printing processes. The U.S. Government believes that these notes are most likely being produced in North Korea. Based on the testimony of defectors they allege that the bills are produced in a factory based in the city of Pyongsong and distributed around the world through North Korean embassies. The U.S. Secret Service estimates that North Korea has produced $45million in superdollars since 1989. Other speculated sources include Iran and Syria, criminal gangs operating out of China and Russia - or even the CIA itself. It alleged he worked in cooperation . with the Russian Communist Party and British criminal contacts to . organise the distribution and resale of the 'super-dollars' - so called . because of their high quality of the forgeries. In an affidavit to the High Court, the . U.S. stated: 'This case involved a long-standing and large-scale . supernotes distribution network based in the Republic of Ireland and . headed by Seán Garland, a senior officer in the Irish Workers' Party.' The U.S. alleges that Mr Garland and . six co-conspirators, a Russian, a South African and four Englishmen, . used couriers to transport supernotes around the world. On a number of occasions between 1997 . and 2000, Garland was allegedly seen visiting the North Korean embassy . in Moscow along with some ex-KGB officers. According to the U.S. indictment, he . visited to collect forged US dollars which, with the help of associates, . would be transported to Dublin and Birmingham where the notes would be . exchanged for pounds or authentic dollars. The indictment also refers to Garland . as 'the man in the hat' and identified specific dates when he had . transported forged currency from North Korean embassies.

"An FBI-style ‘Food Crime Unit’ should be set up to stop international gangs smuggling horse meat into processed food and takeaways, according to a new Government report. Unannounced spot checks on factories and abattoirs should also be introduced alongside a ‘zero tolerance’ approach on anyone caught contaminating food, Professor Chris Elliott said in a review into last year’s horse meat scandal published this morning. The food crime unit will be a new specialist team within the Food Standards Agency. It has been set up amid growing concerns that international gangs are moving away from drug trafficking and armed robbery into food crime. Food experts have warned that the Government cannot be sure that there is no risk to public health from beefburgers contaminated with horse DNA . Prof Elliott said the British food industry was under pressure to 'reduce costs and maximise profits’, leaving families at risk. He said: ‘Consumers are reliant on the leadership, good intentions and good practices of those who supply food and regulate it. Consumers expect government and industry to provide a food system which is safe, resilient and free from criminal interference. ‘Consumers must be able to trust that the food they consume is what it claims to be.’ He said that while all consumers were at risk from food fraud, poorer families spent a higher proportion of their income on processed foods which were more susceptible to fraud. And he said: ‘Some consumers are at risk if they have to rely on others for food preparation, such as those in care homes, or hospitals. ‘Recent surveys by local authorities such as Leicester City Council, West Yorkshire, North Yorkshire and West Sussex, and the consumer organisation Which? have shown that consumers using fast food outlets in inner city areas are often buying food which is not what it claims to be. ‘In some cases the evidence suggests that problems arose because of unintentional labelling mistakes, but there is a concern that other fast food outlets may have been sourcing cheaper meat which increased the risk of food fraud. ‘ . French supermarkets stock horse meat - including this product from Scotland . Michael Ellis, assistant director of Interpol, said criminal gangs were turning away from drugs and trafficking to food fraud. He said: ‘Criminals have realised that they can make the same amount of money by dealing with counterfeit food. Invariably the sentences are much lighter. ‘In my experience, the patterns used by criminals involved in counterfeiting are very similar to those used in the dealing of drugs. ‘They operate front companies, they employ front bank accounts, they will have false declarations for the movement of their goods, they will mis-declare their shipments.’ Prof Elliot said British consumers needed more protection from food crime gangs exploiting soft sentences to rake in huge profits by lacing food with chemicals and cheap meats. And he said consumers must be put first by ensuring that their needs in relation to food safety and food crime prevention are the ‘top priority’. Coordinated police raids  across 33 countries in North America, Asia and Europe last year found widespread abuse. More than 131,000 litres of oil and vinegar, 20 tonnes of spices and condiments, nearly 430,000 litres of counterfeit drink and 45 tonnes of dairy products were seized. In addition, 96 people were arrested. Findus lasagnes were found to have contained horse meat last year, forcing the firm to withdraw the frozen meals from its French supplier, Comigel . Food crime can have deadly consequences. In China in 2008, an industrial chemical called melamine was added to baby milk to increase its protein content. Six babies died of severe kidney damage as a result. In the Czech Republic in 2012, more than 40 people were killed by vodka and rum that had been laced with methanol. Government advisor Prof Elliot has called for a series of measures to tackle the threat of similar tragedies happening in Britain. In his report this morning he called for: . Food crime can have fatal consequences. In China in 2008, an industrial chemical, melamine, was added to increase the protein content of baby milk. Six babies died of severe kidney damage as a result. In the Czech Republic in 2012, more than 40 people were killed by vodka and rum that had been laced with methanol. Mr Ellis told the BBC: ‘Counterfeiting impacts on everyone. The criminals have no care at all for the hygiene or bacterial content in the end product. They just want the brand name in order to get their money.’ In Britain the consumer group Which? tested 60 lamb takeaways and found that 24 of them contained other meats such as beef or chicken. The meat in five samples couldn't be identified at all. Following the report, the Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said: 'When a shopper picks something up from a supermarket shelf it should be exactly what it says on the label, and we’ll crack down on food fraudsters trying to con British consumers. 'As well as keeping up confidence here, we need to protect the great reputation of our food abroad. We’ve been opening up even more export markets, which will grow our economy, provide jobs, and support the Government’s long-term economic plan. 'The action we’re taking gives more power to consumers - meaning they’ve got better labelling on food, better education about where their food comes from, and better, locally-sourced food in schools and hospitals.' But Maria Eagle, Labour’s shadow environment secretary, said: 'Consumers were rightly outraged by the horsemeat scandal, yet the Government has dragged its heels and made absolutely no progress in the 18 months since it happened. 'David Cameron approved changes to the structures of government that weakened consumer protection, culminating in the horsemeat scandal. The confusion this caused is highlighted in today’s report yet the Government have totally failed to admit they got this wrong and have still not reversed the misguided decision to fragment the Food Standards Agency. 'The food industry is the largest single manufacturing sector in the UK, millions of jobs depend on consumer confidence. The Government must now show leadership and establish an effective food crime unit as recommended in the report that can protect the integrity of the food we eat as soon as possible.'","Official report calls for 'Food Crime Unit' to be set up to fight contamination .

"On her 19th birthday, Amy Pejkovic received the earth-shattering news that she had a tumour on her brain stem. Now 21, the champion high jumper and model has made a remarkable recovery, and she is training hard for the Rio De Janeiro Olympics in 2016 after fighting her way back to the number two ranking in Australia. In February 2012 Miss Pejkovic, from Turramurra on Sydney's North Shore, was gearing up for the London Olympics, but her preparations were complicated by the fact she was suffering excruciating headaches, dizziness and was vomiting every day. Scroll down for video . Amy Pejkovic, from Turramurra in Sydney, said she thought she might die when she found out she had a brain tumour in 2012 . Miss Pejkovic has recovered and is now training hard for the Rio De Janeiro Olympics in 2016 . Despite multiple doctors diagnosing her with a middle ear infection her mother and coach Leanne Pejkovic's instincts told her it was something else. After feeling sick during her 19th birthday party she was taken to hospital and where she described her symptoms to a nurse who sent her for an MRI straight away. It was then that he found out she had a baseball-sized brain tumour. 'I was quite scared… Extremely frightened,' Miss Pejkovic told Daily Mail Australia. 'I never thought that something like that would ever happen to me and when it did the first thing I thought was ""Am I going to die?"" 'I thought I was potentially going to be dead in the next few weeks.' Miss Pejkovic, now 21, found out she had the baseball-sized tumour on her brain stem on her 19th birthday . The position of the tumour meant it was blocking fluid from her brain so she had to be admitted to the intensive care unit, and doctors did not know whether the tumour was benign or malignant. After the operation to remove the tumour from the back of her head Miss Pejkovic received her first piece of good news – the operation had gone smoothly and the tumour was benign. Miss Pejkovic had to get the strength to walk again with the help of a walking frame . But the illness had taken its toll – her weight and muscle mass had dropped dramatically and she was too weak to even sit up in bed. 'I lost 10kg in two weeks, I was just skin and bone, it was horrible,' she said. 'Day by day I'd start to sit up until I felt sick and then I'd just lie back down. 'The physio would come in and try to get me to swing my legs off the bed.' Miss Pejkovic had to get the strength to walk again with the help of a walking frame. She had intended to start university that year but put those plans on hold so she could rest and get her strength back. 'I kind of just let myself rest and go on walks and go to training sometimes, but training would consist of walking around the oval once,' she said. 'I started jogging then slowly started doing the drills everyone else was doing.' At the same time she also did a number of modelling jobs. 'Every time they'd  go to do my hair they pull it up and go wait, hold up, why is there a massive strip missing?' Miss Pejkovic said. 'I loved looking at the reactions on their faces when they saw the massive bald patch on my head.' After being back at athletics training for months she felt like she would never be able to get back to her previous standard. That is, until January this year, when she equalled her personal best jump of 186cm at a competition Canberra. The tumour was removed from the back of her head it it was was benign . 'It took a while for me to realise I was back in it… I think it kind of really hit me in Canberra,' she said. 'It was amazing. I started crying actually.' But Miss Pejkovic realised she was definitely back in the game in February, when she beat that record and jumped 187cm at the Queensland State Championships. 'That was the first time I've jumped a personal best in four years,' she said. 'That was quite exciting.' At the same time her modelling career has been taking off, with Miss Pejkovic walking in three shows at Fashion Week in Sydney this year including Talulah and Bec and Bridge. Miss Pejkovic beat hire personal best record and jumped 187cm at the Queensland State Championships in February . She said her recovery has completely changed the way she looks at life . She also has a 'big' campaign for a major sportswear label coming out in October, which she is unable to talk about in detail. Miss Pejkovic is not sure whether she enjoys athletics or modelling more and for now she wants to pursue them both. 'I just sort of balance both of them because they go hand in hand. Even though there are not many models that are also elite athletes,' she said. 'A lot of clients find it quite interesting… They like the fact there's a story behind it.' She is also doing a university bridging course and is hoping to start studying a journalism degree next year.

"Furious visitors to the new  £27million Stonehenge visitor centre have criticised English Heritage for ‘chaotic scenes’ as the site struggles to cope with the crowds. Tourists have slammed the centre – which opened three weeks ago – on travel website TripAdvisor, with positive reviews plummeting by almost half. Most of the criticism centred on the transportation from the centre to the stones. Visitors have moaned about queuing for more than an hour to board a ‘land train’ – three carriages pulled by a Land Rover – which carries 45 people and takes ten minutes to travel to the stones. Scroll down for video . Complaints: Ratings on TripAdvisor have plummeted in the three weeks since the visitor centre opened . With just two land trains operating, . English Heritage has been forced to put on extra regular coaches, hired . from local bus companies, to deal with numbers. Visitors say the system is a ‘farce’ and have asked how the centre will cope when thousands a day visit during the summer. One . reviewer, Paco G, from Spain, said: ‘There are two Land Rovers towing . some wagons and some mini-buses that mysteriously are stopped half of . the time. ‘People were getting angry after one and a half hours of queuing.’ Others . told English Heritage to ‘learn from Disney’ on how to manage crowds, . while more slated the price rise for adult tickets from £8 to £14.95. One . volunteer, who declined to be named, added: ‘When it’s windy or . raining, those in the ticket office can’t open the windows to serve . people because the rain blows in – it’s been built facing the wrong . direction.’ English Heritage asked tourists to be patient while it solved the problems. Previously, Stonehenge enjoyed four- or five-star reviews from 75 per cent of visitors on ratings website TripAdvisor, despite politicians branding the 1960s visitors centre 'a national . disgrace'. But in just 21 days, positive reviews have plummeted to 46 per cent. Negative reviews, giving the site a one-star rating, have jumped from eight per cent to a third. Delays: Visitors waited for an hour-and-a-half for a shuttle bus to take 45 people at a time to the stones . Even those giving Stonehenge a good overall score complaining of the chaos surrounding accessing the stones. A section of the A344 road, which runs past Stonehenge, was permanently closed in June during the construction of the visitor building. The centre, designed by architects Denton Corker Marshall, lies a mile-and-a-half to the west of the stones. English Heritage has admitted there have been 'some issues' and asked tourists to be patient while they solve the problems. One reviewer, ‘Paco G’, from Spain, said: 'There are two Land Rovers towing some wagons and some mini-buses that mysteriously are stopped half of the time. 'People were getting angry after one and a half hours of queuing.' Others told English Heritage to ‘learn from Disney’ on how to manage crowds, while more slated the price rise for tickets from around £8 to £14.95 for an adult. Conflict: The centre had already come under fire from New Age Tribes for exhibiting the skeleton of a Neolithic man rather than burying him . Staff and volunteers have also spoken of their frustrations at the new system. One volunteer, who declined to be named, said it was immediately obvious the centre would not be able to cope with the numbers of people visiting. He said: 'The problem is the transport, getting people to and from the stones. 'They have abandoned the idea of only using the Land Trains, we’ve got coaches now, which kind of defeats the object. 'Also, when it’s windy or raining, those in the ticket office can’t open the windows to serve people because the rain blows in, it’s been built facing the wrong direction.' Kate Davies, Stonehenge’s general manager, yesterday played down the fiercely negative reviews of the new centre, and asked people to be patient. She said: 'There has been huge interest in Stonehenge since the new visitor centre opened towards the end of December. 'On one day alone we welcomed 5,000 visitors which is along the same levels as during our peak summer season. 'This is a brand new operation, on a completely different scale to the old visitor centre, and naturally during these early days, there have been some issues. 'But we are solving them, we have increased our shuttle service taking people to the stones and from 1 February, our timed ticketing system will swing into place. 'The majority of feedback has been overwhelmingly positive; visitors have been fascinated by our new exhibition and love the sense that the stones are now reconnected with the wider landscape. 'We appreciate all the feedback we’ve received and we would ask people to be patient while we iron out the few remaining issues.'","Good ratings on TripAdvisor plummeted by half in just three weeks .

Forty-year-old Miss Mountain, who is a slender 8st, asked for his hand in marriage as they appeared live on ABC's The View, BBC News reported. And that wasn't the only surprise Mr Mason had in store, as the show's hosts announced that as an engagement present they would donate towards the amount needed to fund surgery to remove excess skin following his dramatic weight loss. Asked if a date had been set for their wedding, Miss Mountain told The View: 'There’s so many things we need to do to take care of Paul first.

New York-based plastic surgeon who had agreed to carry out the . procedure for free. Dr .

Mr Mason's binge eating began in his 20s at the time of his father's death and a deterioration in his mother's health. He quit his job as a postman when his weight stopped him from finishing his rounds. As his weight soared he was left unable to stand or walk before finally becoming bed-ridden and being looked after full time by council carers. Firefighters had to demolish the front wall of his former home so they could drive a fork lift truck inside to lift him out and put him into an ambulance when he needed a hernia operation in 2002. Mr Mason was later given a purpose-built housing association home with extra wide doorways so he could move around.

"By the time people wake up tomorrow morning it will be clear whether Scotland is to become an independent country or remain in the United Kingdom. Scotland’s chief counting officer Mary Pitcaithly is pencilled in to announce the historic result at 7am from the Royal Highland Centre in Ingliston outside Edinburgh. Hints of what the outcome is likely to be will drip in through the night as Scotland’s towns and cities release their results. Scroll down for video . Nationalist supporters hope to be able to set off fireworks over Edinburgh in the early tomorrow morning, but need a strong showing in the wealthy capital city . Scotland's central belt - between Edinburgh and Glasgow - will need to turn out heavily for 'Yes' to ensure a Salmond victory . 2am: . North Lanarkshire . Inverclyde . 3am: . Dumfries & Galloway . Dundee . Falkirk . 5am: . Edinburgh . Glasgow . 6am: . Aberdeen . But tonight it emerged that thick fog in the Western Isles could disrupt the count in the  referendum. Western Isles Council is working with the pilot of a chartered plane which is waiting in Oban to fly to Benbecula to take ballot boxes from the southern half of the Western Isles. Discussions are ongoing over when to make a final decision to abort the flight and call-in a fishing boat to transport the ballot boxes by sea. However, the contingency plan to get a shellfish boat to carry the ballot boxes may also be hindered if the sea route is also affected by the heavy mist. Despite that, the first results will be announced at 2am with the key areas of Inverclyde and North Lanarkshire ones to watch. Both are fertile ground for the ‘Yes’ campaign and Alex Salmond will be desperate for a strong show of support for independence. The two central belt local authorities are relatively poor with few voters born outside Scotland. A strong ‘Yes’ showing in Inverclyde and North Lanarkshire will give an early sign that Scotland’s future in the Union really is hanging by a thread. Working class Scots – and in particular, middle aged men in deprived towns – have moved strongly into Mr Salmond’s ‘Yes’ camp. But if the No campaign manages a good turnout, Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling will be able to breathe a sigh of relief that the result is shifting their way. The next counts to watch for are Dumfries and Galloway, and Falkirk – which are both being called at 3am. Dumfries and Galloway is a rare Tory strong hold in Scotland which is heavily unionist. The ‘No’ campaign needs a strong showing on a good turnout to keep any momentum it may have gained earlier in the night. But if the nationalists manage a good showing in this ‘No’ heartland it will point to problems for the Union. Falkirk is the next big hope for the Yes campaign, with Mr Salmond needing a strong showing here before Scotland’s big cities take their turn to announce. The Union flag, held aloft over Edinburgh last night, may fly in Scotland for the last time if the 'Yes' campaign mobilises its working class supporters today . Glasgow and Edinburgh are both scheduled to declare at 5am – and with 860,000 voters between them account for one in five Scots. Both cities are expected to reject independence – but stronger than expected support for independence could tip the referendum to Mr Salmond. In recent polls the ‘No’ campaign had a 12 per cent lead in Glasgow. If this ends up being right, the Yes campaign will have needed to build up a big lead beforehand – or hope for a miracle afterwards.","Today's historic referendum result could be announced by 7am tomorrow .

"Telling results: David Cameron is running a 'Government of chums' where 'who you know' matters more than 'what you know' David Cameron is running a ‘Government of chums’ where ‘who you know’ matters more than ‘what you know’ – and he is becoming  dangerously out of touch with voters as a result. That is the finding of a new poll in the wake of the longest run  of political and public-relations blunders by the Tories, many self-inflicted, since Mr Cameron became Prime Minister. The hostile reaction to the ‘granny tax,’ the ‘pasty tax,’ the petrol panic and the Downing Street ‘donorgate’ scandal appears to have led to a growing feeling that Mr Cameron and his Ministers are elitist and remote. The phrase ‘a Government of chums’ was first coined in a leader column in The Mail on Sunday last week, which asserted that ‘a small group of people from very similar backgrounds, who have known each other for years, are running the country mainly by talking to each other – and to nobody else’. The idea was then taken up by former Tory Cabinet Minister Norman Tebbit in The Times the following day. Now, a poll by Survation for The Mail on Sunday provides convincing evidence that the public concurs. More than six out of ten say Mr Cameron heads a ‘Government of chums’ – fewer than one in seven disagree. Nearly two out of three say entry to Mr Cameron’s elite inner circle depends on ‘who you know’ against just one in five who say ‘what you know’ matters more. Perhaps the most damning verdict came when voters were shown two photographs of Mr Cameron – one in his Oxford University Bullingdon Club days and a more recent one showing him dressed in jeans drinking a pint of beer in a pub – and then asked to identify the ‘real David Cameron’. The Bullingdon Club emerged as the ‘real Cameron’ by a margin of 63 per cent to 37 per cent. Nearly three-quarters of the population view the Conservatives as ‘out of touch’ and 61 per cent say the Tory leader is ‘more style than substance’. The rest of the Cabinet fares little better when it comes to sharing the pain of the recession. Nearly seven out of ten say that Ministers are not personally committed to their ‘we’re all in it together’ slogan. Competiton: Three out of ten pin the same ‘snob’ label on George Osborne, left.  Yet the ratings of the Prime Minister’s fellow Old Etonian Boris Johnson, right, show that it is possible to have a privileged background and still be popular . Four out of ten say Mr Cameron is a ‘snob’ and he polled a lowly average of 13 per cent for being ‘in touch’, ‘caring’, charismatic’, ‘sincere’ and ‘trustworthy’, while nearly one in four said he was ‘competent’. Three out of ten pin the same ‘snob’ label on George Osborne. A dismal one in 25 say the Chancellor is ‘caring’. Yet the ratings of  the Prime Minister’s fellow Old Etonian Boris Johnson show that it is possible to have a privileged background and still be popular. When asked who they would invite to dinner, the public put Mr Johnson way ahead with 22 per cent, followed by Mr Cameron on eight per cent. Unpopular: Only one in ten regard state school-educated Ed Miliband, left, as a snob, yet a mere five per cent would want to sit next to him at dinner, making him a less popular guest than ex-Labour MP George Galloway, right . Only one in ten regard state school-educated Ed Miliband as a snob, yet a mere five per cent would want to sit next to him at dinner, making him a less popular guest than ex-Labour MP George Galloway. Similarly, London Mayor Mr Johnson is seen as ‘most in touch’ by 14 per cent, followed by Mr Miliband on ten, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls on nine and Mr Cameron on eight. But the poll shows the Budget backlash is fading, with Labour’s lead down to five points from its eight-point margin two weeks ago. Labour now stands at 35 and the Tories 30. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg’s woes grow as anti-EU party UKIP has caught up with his Lib Dems on 11 per cent. Mr Cameron will be relieved that despite the Budget backlash, he still beats Mr Miliband on economic trust by 34 per cent to 26. And Mr Miliband’s lack of flair remains a fatal flaw: only one in 33 say he has charisma, against 17 per cent for Mr Cameron. Mr Osborne has edged back in front of Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls on economic trust. However, Mr Balls’ ‘man of the people’ image appears to have helped him achieve a notable victory when voters  were asked who would get the best bargain at a car boot sale. More than one in four chose Mr Balls, with 13 per cent for Mr Osborne; Ed Miliband nine; Mr Cameron eight and Mr Clegg seven. Survation interviewed 1,039 people online on Thursday  and Friday.","Nearly two out of three say entry to Mr Cameron’s elite inner circle depends on ‘who you know’

"Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne netted a winner during a local fishing event near his home in Dorset. The troubled star, who was recently treated in hospital after being found staggering in the street during an alcoholic relapse, was seen chatting with fellow anglers at a private event in Boscombe Bay. He left three hours later clutching his one prized catch, before being taken home in the same taxi which dropped him off. But, despite leaving with a fish, Gazza's mood appeared to be a far cry from his jubilant manner during another fishing excursion last week. Scroll down for video . Former England footballer Paul Gasgoine went along to a local fishing event in Dorset on Saturday . The 47-year-old was seen leaving the lake near Boscombe Bay with one lone fish after three hours of fishing . The ex-footballer looked somber as he left Saturday's event, wearing aviator-style sunglasses and carrying his lone fish. A week earlier, the 47-year-old had been seen beaming as he reeled in two huge trouts during an outing with a friend to a trout farm near Fordingbridge, Hampshire. But on both occasions, the star was looking in much better health, compared to pictures taken in August. Those shocking images showed him clutching a bottle of gin in the street near his rented apartment in Sandbanks, Poole. He was seen wandering the streets outside his expensive apartment block, holding a carrier bag full of cans of Stella Artois, and sitting with his head in his hands. After that, Gazza was taken to hospital when neighbours called 999 for help after finding the midfielder slumped against a wall. An ambulance arrived to take the former England star to hospital. When those pictures emerged - showing him looking gaunt with sunken eyes - QPR manager Harry Redknapp, who also lives Sandbanks, offered him the chance to work alongside him in football. He said: 'I saw him about a month ago and said ""I'll pick you up in the mornings, Gazza, come training with me and do a bit of work with the kids"". I’d love it if he could do that. It's an open invitation. 'He's a great lad and it's sad to see what’s happened to him and how he's looking at the moment.' Catch of the day: Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne netted two huge fish during an outing with a friend in Hampshire last week . He clearly has a knack for the sport, having reeled in two trouts last week . In a TV documentary shown last September, Gascoigne described the pain of fearing he might start drinking again, despite knowing it could kill him. He was first sent to rehab in 1998 by Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson, having found been unconscious after drinking 32 shots of whisky. Since then he has fought a public battle against both drink and drugs, particularly after leaving the world of professional football a decade ago. Last month, he was seen crashing a golf buggy into a ditch after losing control of the 15mpg vehicle at the Playgolf course in Bournemouth. He was said to be dazed but unhurt after the incident. Days later he was photographed cradling a chicken at a pub in Hampshire, and the next day apparently being turned away from an off-licence in Poole. During the trip in Hampshire, the star appeared to be toasting his success on the water with a lager, apparently sipping from a can of Stella Artois beer . For the past four years, Gascoigne has been living in Poole, where he is an occasional patient at the nearby Providence Project rehabilitation centre, but was reportedly due to be evicted from his penthouse flat earlier this month after a string of disturbances. The director of the management company in charge of the flats has dismissed claims he is being forced to leave, but said his landlord was not renewing the rental contract. On September 10, he was arrested for allegedly throwing a brick at a van outside his home in Sandbanks and questioned on suspicion of criminal damage. It is believed it followed an altercation with a photographer. He was released on bail until October pending further enquiries . Can: Fellow fishermen said he had pulled the can from a blue bag bearing the slogan 'Keep Calm And Carry', but had just stuck to one beer, and appeared to be sober . In 2010, he called a radio station to inform them he was off to search for fugitive Raoul Moat while he was hiding from police officers, taking with him a fishing rod, lager and some chicken. He later admitted he did not realise that the former bouncer had shot a police officer in the face and admitted he feels 'guilty' about the incident. Moat died following a stand-off with police. Gascoigne said in a radio interview at the time: 'He is willing to give in now. I just want to give him some therapy and say ""come on Moaty, it's Gazza.""' Gazza seen during his earlier days playing for Newscastle . He later told the Daily Express: 'I thought I could take him fishing because stuff like that has worked on me. But his situation was different from mine.' In a TV documentary shown last September, Gascoigne described the pain of fearing he might start drinking again, despite knowing it could kill him. Last year his friends DJ Chris Evans and ex-England cricketer Ronnie Irani paid for Gascoigne to attend a rehab clinic in Arizona. Hunter Davies, who co-wrote the former star's 2004 autobiography, said: 'He doesn’t even like alcohol. He hates the taste of it. 'I’ve been with him when he’s poured it into flower pots, because he finds it so revolting. But then he will get depressed, and just want to get obliterated.' Despite his demons, he is still remembered fondly by fans of the clubs he played for - including Newcastle United, Lazio, Rangers, Everton and Middlesbrough - for his brilliance on the pitch. He starred in midfield for Terry Venables' England side during Euro 96, where his virtuoso goal against Scotland was topped off with an equally memorable celebration. Six years earlier he was seen crying on the pitch after being booked in the semi-final of the 1990 World Cup against West Germany. The booking making him unable to play in the final.","Paul Gascoigne went along to a local fishing event near Boscombe, Dorset .

"Australia beat Pakistan by five wickets to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the one-day international series. Having won the toss and seen openers Ahmed Shehzad and Sarfraz Ahmed put on 126, Pakistan crumbled to 215 all out as Mitchell Johnson took three for 40. Australia's top three failed to produce big scores but Glenn Maxwell carried them through with 76 and, having won the opening match by 93 runs thanks to Steve Smith's century, they appear well set to complete a series clean sweep in Abu Dhabi on Sunday. Australian players celebrate after the dismissal of Pakistan batsman Mohammad Irfan . Umar Akmal (right) looks on after being dismissed as Australia wrapped up a series win against Pakistan . Pakistan, though, had started well and Shehzad glanced Johnson's leg-side loosener for four as seven came from the first over. James Faulkner's first ball brought a loud lbw appeal against Sarfraz but he survived and the batsmen's partnership passed 50 in the 12th over. The last ball before drinks saw Sarfraz launch Xavier Doherty for six but Shehzad was first to his half-century, from 63 balls when he hit Lyon for his fifth four to also bring up Pakistan's century. He was uncharacteristically dropped by George Bailey at mid-off before Sarfraz followed him to 50, from 60 balls with four fours and a six. It all changed, though, when Shehzad pulled Doherty to mid-wicket to depart for 61 and Johnson returned to have Sarfraz caught at point for 65. Australia batsman David Warner strikes the ball on the way to scoring 29 runs . Captain Misbah-ul-Haq was run out for 15 and Umar Akmal made just five before becoming Johnson's second victim, again with the first ball of a spell. Asad Shafiq hit Kane Richardson for six and Lyon for four but was then caught off the latter, chipping straight to Johnson for 29. Shahid Afridi and Wahab Riaz contributed only two apiece and debutant Raza Hasan was run out without scoring - as was the lumbering Mohammad Irfan to finish the innings. Hasan nearly had a wicket in each of his first two overs, but replays showed Aaron Finch's edge dropped short of Umar Akmal before a leaping Fawad was unable to cling on to Warner's sweep. Finch made 14 before being given out on review after edging Irfan to keeper Sarfraz, who also caught Smith for 12 off Babar to leave Australia 39 for two. Pakistan batsman Sarfraz Ahmed receives encouragement from Ahmed Shehzad after he scored half a century but it was not enough to prevent Pakistan slumping to 215 all out . Pakistan batsman Misbah Ul Haq hits the ball before being run out for just 15 runs in the one-day international . Warner fell for 29 when a lusty blow was only prevented from going for six by the presence on the boundary of the 7ft Irfan, who took a good catch. Maxwell had made only two when he edged Hasan to slip and was dropped by Akmal but he and Bailey put on 85 for the fourth wicket to all but make the game safe. Maxwell crashed Afridi for six and his 56-ball half-century also featured six fours, and he added two more off Hasan in the next over. Bailey was run out superbly for 28 by a direct hit from Shehzad but Maxwell reached 76 from 81 balls before being caught off a top edge. Brad Haddin announced himself with a four and a six in succession off Hasan and with seven needed from six overs, James Faulkner finished the job with back-to-back boundaries.","Australia strolled to victory to move 2-0 ahead in series with one to play .

"Five years after the brutal rape and murder of a 23-year-old Tennessee boy, his mother and stepfather are finally going on trial. Joshua Starner, 25, has been charged in the beating death of Keegan Metz, who suffered severe head trauma. A medical examination revealed that the boy had been sodomized before the slaying. Both Starner and Keegan's mother, 26-year-old Caitlyn Metz, are facing two counts each of felony first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and aggravated rape of a child. Monstrous charges: Joshua Starner, 25, is . accused of sodomizing his 23-month-old stepson, Keegan Metz, and then . beating him to death in February 2009 . Mother on trial: Caitlyn Metz, 26, faces charges of murder and child abuse and rape in connection to her son's death, which prosecutors say she had a part in . Starner and Metz's murder trial was originally scheduled to begin back in January 2011, but the proceedings were delayed as the prosecution continued analysing medical evidence, The Leaf Chronicle reported. On Tuesday morning, the joint jury trial of Starner and Metz got under way, with Judge Mike R. Jones presiding over the case. The tragic incident took place February 7, 2009, when 23-month-old Keegan was rushed to a Nashville hospital with forehead trauma and bruises all over his body. The following day, the toddler succumbed to his injuries, which doctors at Vanderbilt Children's Hospital ruled to be non-accidental. The child’s stepfather, then-20-year-old Fort Campbell soldier Joshua Starner, was arrested on the day of the incident and charged with aggravated child abuse. Keegan’s mother, Mrs Metz, initially told police that her son looked healthy when she left him in the care of his stepfather in their apartment on Ballygar Street in Clarksville so she could go to the store. When she returned home about two hours later, Metz told investigators she found her son lying unresponsive in his bed. Just before 1pm February 7, 2009, the mother called 911 and the boy was taken to Gateway Hospital, and later transferred to Vanderbilt for treatment. Doctors who examined little Keegan noted that besides brain swelling, the toddler suffered from severe tearing of the anus and bruises all over his body consistent with abuse. What she claimed: Metz, pictured here with an unidentified child, told police that her son looked healthy when . she left him in her husband's care for two hours to go to the store . When questioned by police, Starner said his stepson may have slipped and fallen while he was giving him a bath. In the course of the five-year investigation, the prosecution said that medical evidence produced new theories that implicated Caitlyn Metz in her son's murder. The woman was arrested in Oregon in February 2012 and extradited to Tennessee to face charges in connection to her child's sexual abuse and death. It has been alleged that Mrs Metz may have been aware of her son's abuse and the circumstances of his killing. Joshua Starner has been jailed on $1.45million bond since his arrest more than five years ago.","Keegan Metz was rushed to a hospital in February 2009 suffering from brain swelling, bruising and severe tearing of his anus .

"Concerns: MP Patrick Mercer¿s views reflect growing concern within the Tory party about the proposals . Secret court hearings will hand a major propaganda victory to terrorists, a former security adviser to David Cameron has warned. Senior Tory MP Patrick Mercer said he had ‘grave’ concerns about the Government’s plans, which he warned would erode centuries of open justice. The former Army officer, who served as the party’s homeland security spokesman until 2007, also claimed the measures would succeed in destroying British values – effectively doing the  terrorists’ job for them. He pointed out that Britain had successfully fought tyrannies throughout history without having to resort to secret court hearings. Mr Mercer’s views reflect growing concern within the Tory party about the proposals, which extend ‘closed material procedures’ – ensuring cases are conducted behind closed doors – to any civil or inquest hearing. The comments came as it emerged ministers are preparing to backtrack over plans to allow ministers to decide which hearings can be conducted in secret. Mr Mercer said: ‘My grave difficulty with this – particularly in cases of counter terrorism and security – is that any changes to what we have at the moment will erode the very thing for which we are fighting: freedom of speech, and free and open trials which are an immensely important element of British justice. ‘It is an element with which we fought tyrannies successfully down the years. We countered Nazism, communism and Irish republicanism without having to resort to these sort of measures. 'The point about terrorism and subversion is that it endeavours to change the way we live our lives and the tenets upon which we base our justice. ‘By imposing these changes  upon ourselves, we are doing the subversives’ jobs for them.’ Open: The Royal Courts of Justice, London. A U-turn by ministers would be a significant step in the fight to maintain transparency in the British justice system, ruling out plans to allow inquests to be held in secret . Mr Mercer also drew comparisons with the Diplock courts in Northern Ireland, where cases were heard by a single judge without a jury. ‘While they satisfied the short term desire to put some terrorists behind bars, they laid us open to accusations of injustice and authoritarianism – the very things we were fighting,’ he added. ‘They eventually ceased to operate because the propaganda value they handed to our opponents outweighed the usefulness of the product. I strongly suspect, having got as far as . we have in the so-called war against terror, that to apply these . changes to terrorist cases will be to shoot ourselves in the foot.’ Mr Mercer’s remarks are another blow to the Government’s plans to extend ‘secret justice’. The Lib Dems and Labour are refusing to . back the proposals as they stand, meaning the draft Bill appears to have . no chance of becoming law. The Daily Mail has led criticism of plans for more secret courts as an affront to traditions of open justice. As the debate has grown increasingly fractious, Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke and Home Secretary Theresa May have issued a last-ditch letter to Tory MPs to boost support for the plans. The Cabinet ministers have been accused of making ‘spurious’ claims that failing to back secret courts would lead to terror suspects being granted British passports. They have also claimed that U.S. spies have been holding back on sharing information with Britain for fear it would end up in open court – a claim disputed by some security sources in Washington. Under the plans in the Justice and Security green paper, defendants or claimants would not be allowed to be present, know or challenge the case against them and must be represented by a security-cleared advocate rather than their own lawyer. Parliament’s joint committee on human rights has produced a report damning the plans as ‘inherently unfair and dangerous’. Senior sources have revealed that Mr Clarke is looking at backing away from allowing secret justice hearings in all but a ‘tiny’ number of terrorism cases.","Senior Tory MP Patrick Mercer said he had 'grave' concerns .

"Ben Ford is a big bear of a man. Big beard, big hands, big build. By his own admission he is 'the spitting image' of his father Harrison Ford, and thinks his dad would be his size if he hadn't spent much of his life on a Hollywood diet. Both men love to eat. Ben loves nothing better than to cook huge macho meals. He's big on meat. Big on barbecues. Big on potatoes. In fact his new book Taming The Feast, with its instructions on how to build a barbecue from scratch, is possibly the most macho cookbook ever written. Scroll down for video . Ben loves nothing better than cooking huge macho meals . We're at Ben's restaurant, Ford's Filling Station, in LA. The menu has years of experience behind it and a secret ingredient of homeliness he says he inherited from his mother, former cheerleader Mary Marquardt. Ben wants a new generation of men to get out there and barbecue for a crowd. 'I want to inspire people who've done it before and give them something more. Most of the recipes in the book are for eight to ten people, and I have great memories of sitting around big tables with lots of food and a little too much to drink. I wanted to reproduce those experiences.' Ben, at 46, is the eldest of Harrison's four children (two by Mary, two by his second wife, screenwriter Melissa Mathison). His parents' 14-year marriage fell apart when Ben was about 12, just as Harrison was starting to make it as an actor; for most of Ben's childhood his father was a carpenter. In the past Harrison has blamed his split with Ben's mother on his new-found fame, and it was while he was going through that first divorce that he met his second wife. Harrison Ford with his first wife Mary Marquardt (Ben's mother) in 1977 . Their marriage lasted 18 years before he met Calista Flockhart, who played Ally McBeal, in 2002 and they married in 2010. Ben says that his father and Calista often come to his restaurant with Calista's 13-year-old son Liam – Harrison loves the food – and they all get on very well. 'But there weren't so many celebrity friends when my parents were together,' he adds. 'As the eldest son I missed out on the fun. My father was doing a lot of carpentry back then, and he only started to find success as I was becoming a teenager. Dad was always fixing up the house, and he'd often take me to building sites, show me the floor joists, how everything fitted together. Seeing how meticulous he was at his craft has stayed with me as a chef. 'As you might expect from the life-changing times when he became Han Solo in Star Wars, my parents split up. But I had a wonderful stepfather in Bob Becker, who was a director of shows like Dallas and Knots Landing and loved to cook. I feel like I got the best of it, it was a good situation.' Ben with his father and stepmother Calista Flockhart . Harrison's career began to take him all over the world – he's in England at the moment, of course, shooting the new Star Wars film; he broke his left leg on set last month – but Ben says the two were never estranged. 'My father was definitely around when I was growing up. He was a constant, and he likes to cook too. I gave him a copy of my book for Father's Day, so I hope he's cracked it open and is experimenting for summer, but it's difficult for people to enjoy food in Hollywood. I'm a much bigger version of my dad, so I understand what it takes for him to look like he does. I cook all the time. He doesn't.' Ben grew up wanting to play baseball professionally until a serious knee injury put paid to his dreams and he switched careers at a time when chefs thrived on a culture of aggression in the kitchen. 'It was hard at first,' he says. 'I had a couple of instances where I had to work for tough, belligerent chefs. It's fiercely competitive if you're working anywhere worth its salt. It takes a particular kind of muscle, which is something I find a lot of satisfaction in because not everyone can do it. You're on your feet 14, sometimes 16 hours a day, six days a week. It's a lot of sacrifice.' It certainly takes its toll on the personal life. 'Yes,' he nods wearily. His first marriage to TV news producer Elizabeth Winkler produced a  13-year-old son, Ethan, and he has four-year- old Waylon from his happy second marriage to Emily, who works in his restaurant business. Growing up with a famous parent can open doors but it can also create a lot of pressure. 'I found it more difficult than rewarding at times,' he admits. Ben's cookbook, Taming the Feast contains some of Ben's most manly meaty recipes . 'You want to be one of the guys you're working with, but sometimes that was hard for me. Also there was less trust in my commitment to the profession. People thought, ""He doesn't need it as much as the next guy."" It has its advantages too. It would be silly to shun the attention. But when I was younger I felt unworthy of that attention.' Ben says he'll always remember when his father first started making money and they had a fancy holiday in Hawaii. He saw a whole pig being cooked on the beach and it was a pivotal moment for him. A whole roasted pig is now one of his signature dishes. He got his passion for roasting when he came to visit his father shooting Raiders Of The Lost Ark at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire. 'They were shooting so many films there at that time. Wandering around the sets would be fun, there was James Bond and Pink Panther. At weekends we always seemed to go to someone's home, never to a restaurant, for a Sunday roast. I watched everything.' Ben was one of the first to offer whole-animal cuisine – now in vogue – at his first restaurant back in 1999. He was also one of the first restaurateurs to employ foragers, who gather wild ingredients from hedgerows and woods, which is ultra-chic in LA right now. But none of it would have happened, he says, without his mother's cooking. 'When I was growing up my mum would make a simple roast chicken but it was the best I've ever had. I still can't reproduce it after 28 years of trying. She still makes the roast chicken,' he says sadly. 'She has MS and it's progressive.' At times it's seemed as though the nurturing force of his mother's chicken has got the family through her health crisis. 'Food is more of a nurturing force in my mother's house than in my father's. My mum is a very special person. She and my father are still friends. That she was able to stay friends for her children says how special she is.' I get the impression that however competitive Ben is, he doesn't ever want to make a roast chicken better than his mother's.

"Alastair Cook has broken his silence on the Kevin Pietersen affair to hit out at accusations of a bullying culture in the England cricket team and to defend coach Andy Flower and team-mate Matt Prior, who bore the full brunt of Pietersen's bile in his controversial autobiography. The England captain took the decision to speak on behalf of his team on Saturday at the end of a week which has seen one of the greatest of all England teams being under repeated attack from the man they jettisoned in January. 'It's been a really sad week for cricket,' said Cook. 'After talking to quite a few of my teammates on the England team, we have to draw a line under it at some stage and this is a good time to do that. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch .

Flower's regime led to cliques (and Trott telling Prior and Swann to 'f*** off') Flower was a 'f****** horrendous' 'Mood Hoover' 'I am very proud of the era I have played in; to win three Ashes, to become the best side in the world; to play with some great players. I really only have fond memories of that. I am incredibly proud to have contributed in that period. 'To play under Andrew Strauss, to have played under Andy Flower as coach, I have only got respect for these guys. I do believe that era has been tarnished, and I am sad about that. I have known Andy [Flower] since the Essex dressing room, when he took me under his wing as a player. Obviously, your relationship changes as a coach and captain and I only have respect for him as a man, and as a coach. 'He was an amazing coach for our side. Chatting to some of the guys about it, they feel the same; a lot of the success was down to his drive and determination to make us a tough England side.' Cook's relationship turned sour with Pietersen after the batsman was sacked from England's team last winter . In reference to accusations about Prior in the book Cook said in an interview with the BBC: 'That was probably the biggest shock for me. He is a great man who has been a fantastic servant for English cricket. 'Hopefully if he can get through his really nasty injury, we could see him again in an England shirt. He has to be remembered as a guy who put his heart and soul on the line for England all the time, and the team was all that mattered to him. 'He has put everything into the England shirt and he should be incredibly proud of that.' Asked if he recognised the accusations of a bullying culture in the book Cook was adamant. 'No I don't,' he said. 'International cricket is a tough place and as a team you are striving for excellence at all times. Pietersen and England captain Alastair Cook are all smiles after England's Ashes win in 2013 . Pietersen and Matt Prior, who Cook believes has been wrongly criticised, celebrate England's 2011 Ashes win . 'Certainly at some stages those frustrations probably boiled over more than they should have done, but that was only people desperate to succeed and wanting to know the other ten blokes around them were committed 100 per cent to them. 'Did it over step the mark a couple of times? Possibly, but we addressed those issues – this is something that always happens in teams. It certainly wasn't a 'bullying environment' at all in my eyes.' 'As the captain over the last couple of years, I have tried to make it as successful as I can for the young players coming in and to make them feel comfortable. 'International cricket is a tough environment to perform in compared to county cricket because of the level of scrutiny. It's a big step up and it is a tough environment. Pietersen's autobiography has rocked the world of cricket with various scathing revelations . Fans flocked to Waterstone's in Canary Wharf for Pietersen's book signing . 'From this summer you have seen those young guys coming in and I take a lot of pride from that – seeing people like Gary Ballance, Joe Root and Chris Jordan really thriving in this environment playing international cricket.' Cook finally emphasised his determination to carry on leading England next year when they will compete for the World Cup and the Ashes. 'Without a doubt. It's been an interesting summer for a number of reasons, but we finished off in great style by winning the Test Series against India. 'You always learn as England captain and I made great strides forward and I will continue to do that.

"It was fight night at the Charlotte Motor Speedway rally when two drivers began fighting between two trucks after the race. Tension between drivers Matt Kenseth and Brad Keselowski reached a boiling point in the aftermath of Saturday night's event. Kenseth, who struggled for large portions of the race and was penalized by NASCAR before the start for an unapproved adjustment made to his car, was incensed that Keselowski hit his car on pit road after the checkered flag. Kenseth had already taken off his seatbelts and lowered his window net, and he felt the contact from Keselowski could have caused injury. Watch as Matt Kenseth attacks fellow driver Brad Keselowski in the paddock after the race . Kenseth quickly approached Keselowski from behind and nearly tackled him. He had Keselowski wrapped in his arms when crew members quickly peeled him off, and Keselowski crew chief Paul Wolfe pulled Kenseth out of the scrum in what appeared to be a choke hold. There is no room for error in the Chase, and a bad night will put a driver on the brink of elimination. 'If you want to talk about it as a man, try to do that,' Kenseth said. For his part, Keselowski said the hit on Kenseth was warranted because Kenseth had driven across his nose under a caution with six laps remaining. That contact caused front-end damage that Keselowski believed contributed to his 16th-place finish.

"Christian Wade's latest scorching demonstration of predatory try-scoring reignited his England prospects on Sunday, but wasn’t quite enough to propel Wasps to a famous European victory. Ultimately, Leinster asserted their status as an established force in continental competition by fighting back from a 20-11 deficit in this Pool Two clash to record a 26th win in their last 30 home matches at this exalted level and avoid a first defeat at the RDS Arena since 2009. Yet, they were given an almighty scare by one of the Aviva Premiership’s rising clubs, as Wasps surged in front courtesy of Wade’s solo masterpiece. Leinster's Darragh Fanning (centre), scorer of two tries, leaves the field after the victory . Fanning goes over in the second-half for Leinster's second try of the match against Wasps . Leinster : Madigan; Kirchner, D’Arcy, Reid, Fanning; Gopperth, Reddan (Boss, 61); McGrath, Cronin (Strauss, 65), Bent (Furlong, 65); Toner, McCarthy (Douglas, 47); Ruddock, Heaslip (capt), Ryan. Tries: Fanning (2), Ryan. Cons: Madigan (2). Pens: Gopperth, Madigan. Wasps : Masi (Miller, 21-24; 28); Wade, Daly, Leiua, Tagicakibau; Goode (Bell, 44-48; 63), Simpson; Mullan (capt. McIntyre, 72), Festuccia, Cittadini (Cooper-Woolley, 61); Launchbury, Davies (Gaskell, 63); Johnson, Hughes, Thompson (Jones, 41). Tries: Leiua, Wade. Cons: Goode (2). Pens: Goode (2). Referee: Leighton Hodges (Wales). Att: 17,558. Nothing was on, or so it seemed, when the ball came to the diminutive 23-year-old in the 34th minute. The visitors had a penalty advantage, so he just tried his luck and it paid off gloriously. Wade darted to his right and swerved past the flailing Ian Madigan. That created the space, but he still had plenty to do. Flicking on the turbo jets, he raced past Darragh Fanning down the flank and, as Zane Kirchner charged across to make a try-saving cover tackle, Wade leapt past him and kept his balance to touch down. It was a staggering exhibition of finishing class and a very timely one, too. England head coach Stuart Lancaster and his assistants are announcing their squad for the autumn internationals on Wednesday and wing is an area of uncertainty. Wade is among a clutch of contenders jostling for a place next month and this wonderful strike will have done him no harm, although any reservations about the uncapped Lion have always focused on his defending rather than attacking. ‘Christian has struggled with his confidence this season and he has struggled to get into games,’ said Dai Young, Wasps’ director of rugby. Fanning celebrates in the Pool two European Rugby Champions Cup clash in Dublin . ‘But we all know he is capable of doing something special. He is always a threat and he has been getting better every game since he came back from injury. On the big stage, he can always do something like that and he also defended well today.’ While that will have come as good news for Lancaster and England as well as Wasps, less welcome was the sight of Joe Launchbury needing treatment near the end, after being tackled by Kane Douglas and Tadhg Furlong. The lock played on to the end, but he will be assessed by his club’s medical staff today. ‘Joe took a bit of a knock from the side on his knee,’ said Young. ‘The physios will have a look at him. I don’t expect it to be anything too serious, but we’ll have a look at it tomorrow.’ Leinster captain and Man of the Match Jamie Heaslip applauds the supporters at the RDS Arena . Before Wade’s dramatic intervention, Wasps had already seized the initiative in stirring fashion, despite Leinster’s early onslaught led by their barnstorming No 8 and captain, Jamie Heaslip. Jimmy Gopperth’s early penalty put the hosts in front but Andy Goode responded with two shots of his own at the other end, before Young’s men claimed the game’s first try. Leinster were moving forward with intent near halfway but Noel Reid’s pass was intercepted by Alapati Leiua and the centre burst clear to score by the posts. Goode added the routine conversion. Stunned by that setback, Leinster responded promptly. Heaslip broke tackles by Launchbury and Elliot Daly on the left, then Gopperth sent a clever low kick towards the corner and Fanning chased through to score. Wade’s try re-established Wasps’ advantage, with Goode adding the conversion from a tight angle, but a Madigan penalty just before the break gave Leinster momentum and they took charge after half-time, with the wind at their backs. Christian Wade of Wasps races clear to score a try, but the English side's lead diminished . Devin Toner created a second try for Fanning by charging down Joe Simpson’s kick and driving deep into Wasps’ 22 seconds later, and the conversion by Madigan reduced the gap to two points. The force was with the home side and hooker Sean Cronin blazed a trail through the visitors’ defence on the hour, to pave the way for Dominic Ryan to touch down the match- winning try. Again, Madigan added the extras and Leinster should have extended their lead in the closing stages, but Wasps hung on gamely to earn a backs-to-the-wall bonus point which may be decisive in a potentially close pool battle. Wasps host Harlequins at Adams Park on Sunday and they are optimistic that captain James Haskell — who missed this game with flu — will be available again. They know they need to win that home tie to galvanise their European campaign, but Young was bullish after this game. ‘We’ve lost the battle today but we haven’t lost the war,’ he said.

"Brian O'Driscoll has recalled being wrongfully arrested for assault and how the shock of a friend's death left him a sobbing wreck. The arrest happened on a trip to New York with friends to watch an REM concert and left him fearing he would face prosecution and a media scandal until just days before the 2009 Six Nations, when the case against him was dropped. After the gig O'Driscoll and two friends were accused of pushing in a crowded lift. The book says his friend Damien O'Donoguhe used his elbow in self-defence to stop a drunk audience member from punching him. Brian ODriscoll has revealed that he was arrested in New York in his autobiography, The Test . O'Driscoll was on a trip to New York with friends to watch an REM concert when the arrest happened . The police were called and the man claimed he was attacked by O'Driscoll. The legendary Irish rugby player  - widely regarded as one of the best centres of all time -  recalls the details in The Sunday Times, which is serialising his book The Test. It details how he was taken to a notorious Manhattan jail known as The Tombs where his mug shot was taken and his fingerprints entered into the US justice system. He says he was forced to sleep on the floor alongside the 'most wasted looking guy in the cell' who was 'shaking from the DT's, dribbling and moaning, twitching and farting'. The investigation hung over O'Driscoll for the rest of his holiday, turning it in to a 'nightmare' during which he was weighed down by a 'sense of panic, the worry about what's coming next', the book says. In it he also remembers his friend Barry, who committed suicide, and tells how he began to sob when he called the man's fiancee. O'Driscoll played 125 times for Ireland and also had eight appearances for the British and Irish Lions . The former Irish centre (left) with Ben Kay as a BT Sport pundit for their coverage of Leinster against Wasps . He says: 'She listens as the emotions pour out of me, more than I knew was there.' After the New York arrest, O'Driscoll feels he is still not believed even after Mr O'Donoguhe came forward to clear his name, . The book says he believes the prosecutors 'suspect his motives: taking a bullet for his buddy, the well-know Irish sports guy'. It says: 'Even after Damo files a sworn affidavit, absolving me of any responsibility and stating that he acted in self-defence, it drags on through the summer.' He says he was stunned that the story did not leak to the media and was told the case against him had been dropped about 10 days before the 2009 Six Nations. O'Driscoll counts captaining the Ireland Rugby team from 2004 up until the 2013 Six Nations and captaining Leinster Rugby for three seasons from 2005/6 - 2007/8 among his career successes. He also captained the British and Irish Lions for their 2005 tour of New Zealand. He has 133 Test caps, including 125 for Ireland and eight for the British and Irish Lions.","Brian O'Driscoll releasing new book called The Test .

"Sam Champion has officially switched over to the competition as he made his first appearance on longtime morning show rival, the Today Show. The former Good Morning America weatherman left the ABC morning show to become the managing editor of The Weather Channel where he will anchor his own three-hour show. Since The Weather Channel is owned by NBC, he went on The Today Show briefly Thursday morning to tease his new show where he was welcomed with open arms and stories of his longtime friendship with Al Roker. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Joining the other team: Sam Champion was an unusual sight on the Today Show this morning after being the weatherman for rival Good Morning America for years . 'This is a weather vortex!' co-anchor Savannah Guthrie joked about having both Roker and Champion in the same place after being on competing channels for so long . The scene would have been a difficult one for his former colleagues at Good Morning America to stomach, as media critics regularly attributed their record-breaking ratings coup over the Today Show to the easy chemistry that the GMA cast shared. The Today Show crew were clearly trying to mimic it with Champion's appearance this morning. The show's Twitter feed was quick to publicize the visit, posting a picture of the smiling anchors on set. Warm front moving in: Champion is now running his own three-hour morning show on The Weather Channel which is owned by NBCUniversal as is The Today Show . Excited: Champion said that the goal is to have more people watch The Weather Channel for longer as opposed to their regular consumption habits of tuning in quickly and leaving . Longtime pals: Champion said that Al Roker was his first friend when he moved to New York 25 years ago . The segment only lasted less than three minutes, but Champion used it as a way to show his longtime ties to the network through Roker and his plans for the yet-untitled Weather Channel morning show. 'This is awesome because everyone watches the Weather Channel in the morning- they dip in and they dip out,' Champion explained. 'We're going to present a really good, focused weather cast with a lot of live events and a lot of pictures from all over the planet of what's going on in the weather that morning. We want people- you know, folks who are interested in the weather- we want them to get that full compliment in the morning.' Still close: He clearly isn't forgetting his ABC pals as he posted this picture with Josh Elliott just two days ago . While no logistical details about the show have been announced, it is extremely unlikely that Al Roker will be leaving his work on The Today Show to be alongside Champion, but the fact that they are both under the same parent corporation appears to have come as a welcome fact to the ABC transplant. 'We've known each other for 25 years and this is the first chance we've had to actually work together,' Champion said of Roker this morning. 'Do you know when I got to New York and started local news- my very first live shot, I don't know if you remember this- but it was a circus was in town. You were the first person and my first friend in New York because when I moved here, I didn't know anyone, and Al came up and we made friends during that live shot.'","Sam Champion has made his first appearance on an NBC show after working for rival network ABC for years .

"Sentiment is a limited currency in horse racing as Lady Cecil has found out this summer. The goodwill which carried her Newmarket stable through the second half of last season after the death of her much-loved husband Sir Henry Cecil has largely been replaced by a more pragmatic mood. Winners are the only commodity which count in a sport where you can go out of fashion faster than last summer’s Royal Ascot frock. Noble Mission, here in May's Huxley Stakes in Chester, is third favourite in the Qipco Champions Stakes . But an ally entwined in the final magnificent chapter of Sir Henry’s career has quite literally kept the Warren Place flag flying. Lady Cecil ensured tradition was maintained after Frankel’s not-so-little brother Noble Mission won the Group One Tattersalls Gold Cup at the Curragh in May by flying the Cecil family standard above her Warren Place stable. The colt subsequently secured a second success at the highest level in the Grand Prix de Saint Cloud. But on Saturday at Ascot, Noble Mission could secure a win of infinitely more significance in the Group One Qipco Champion Stakes - the race Frankel won in 2012, 12 months after he had landed the two-furlong shorter Queen Elizabeth II Stakes on the same stage of British Champions day. The five-year-old, owned by Prince Khaled Abdullah, is 9-2 third favourite behind French-trained 11-8 favourite Cirrus Des Aigles, the French gelding beaten under two lengths by the slow-starting Frankel on an emotionally-charged afternoon when Cecil admits her heart nearly stopped from nervous excitement. Lady Jane Cecil, carrying on the work of her late and great husband Sir Henry Cecil, with Noble Mission . Lady Cecil, who runs Frankel’s half sister Joyueuse in the Challenge Stakes at Newmarket on Friday, said: ‘I hardly dare dream. Noble Mission is in great form and has done well for his break. The race can’t come quick enough. ‘We know he likes soft ground – it is just a shame Cirrus does too but it is going to make it hard for some of the others. ‘To even think we are having a runner in with a chance on such a huge day is a huge privilege. ‘He has been a real flag bearer since we have decided to use more forcing tactics. ‘I can’t tell you what it was like that day in Ireland, it was very special, especially him being Frankel’s brother. That was one of things I really wanted to achieve and how likely did it seem last year?’ Lady Cecil, with Noble Mission after the Irish 1000 Guineas in May, says the horse is in 'great form' Eighteen wins this season, but only six since the start of June, have been landed by Lady Cecil from a much-reduced string of around 50 horses. But she insists she has had no reason to regret the decision to keep her late husband’s stable going. ‘At the beginning, I know it is not a reason to do it, but it was a way of staying close to Henry,’ Lady Cecil said. ‘If it had all had to finish, that would have been more difficult. ‘I haven’t got the numbers of some Newmarket trainers but I think we have done well with what we have got – two Group One wins, two Group Three and a Listed race. ‘I am quite a determined person. I think it has gone well. You always want more and we all want winners but you can’t expect to have them continually. I have a lot to look forward to next year.’ Trainer Sir Michael Stoute has confirmed that a Champions meeting at Ascot on Saturday stripped of many of its biggest names will at least have the Queen’s Estimate lining up in the Long Distance Cup. It had been feared soft ground might prevent the 2013 Ascot Gold Cup winner running but Stoute said: ‘We’ll give it a shot.’ Ascot Gold Cup winner Estimate, pictured being ridden by Ryan Moore, will race in the Long Distance Cup . Encke, the Godolphin-trained 2012 St Leger winner who became embroiled in the Anabolic Steroid scandal involving trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni, sustained a fatal hind limb injury while working on Tuesday.

"Mark Wotte has left his role as Scottish Football Association performance director. The Dutchman joined the SFA in June 2011 to oversee the SFA's performance strategy across all age groups. In an SFA statement, Wotte said: 'I am proud to have been the Scottish FA's first performance director leading this nationwide project and I leave safe in the knowledge that this great football nation is on the rise again.' Mark Wotte has stepped down after three years in his role as performance director of the Scottish FA . There have been signs of major improvement with the Scottish national side, particularly in recent matches . Wotte believes he has achieved what he was asked to do, by putting a strategy in place which has seen seven regional performance schools set up. The former Southampton manager said: 'With the performance schools now into their third year, the successes in qualification for finals by our national youth teams, and of course the great work by Gordon Strachan and Anna Signeul in the men's and women's A squads, I am confident that Scottish football is on the path to success again. 'I have absolutely loved my time in Scotland and have been grateful for the excellent support of my coaching team, performance department staff and, of course, the member clubs. However, my job was to implement the strategy to move Scottish football forward: clearly the structure is now fully in place and Scottish football will continue to see the benefits in coming years. Wotte's job was to implement performance strategy across all age groups in Scottish football . 'I feel I have completed the tasks I was set and I am delighted with the swift progress but I am really looking forward to a new challenge.' SFA chief executive Stewart Regan added: 'On behalf of the board and staff at the Scottish FA I would like to thank Mark for taking the performance strategy from an ambitious goal in the early days of our strategic plan, Scotland United: A 2020 Vision, to an exciting reality. 'In just over three years, we have already seen signs of great progress and I would reiterate my thanks to Mark for providing such a solid foundation on which to build future success for Scottish football.'

"A fist-pumping run down the line, a rare win and a red card for the new boy. Life is rarely dull for Neil Lennon and his start to life as a manager in England was no different. He waited six months for this chance, first eyeing a position in the Premier League and then, in time, the vacancies at Cardiff and Fulham. Some of his calls around the houses were answered, a few were ignored. No-one seemed to want a man who led Celtic to a win over Barcelona not so long ago. So here he is at Bolton. They were bottom of the Championship going into this one; they finished it with only their second win of the season and their new boss in the stands. Bolton defender Matt Mills (centre) scored the only goal of the match heading home on 20 minutes . Mills (right) is congratulated by his team-mates for his goal which moves the Trotters off bottom spot . Mills (left) celebrates his strike with Neil Lennon (centre) as he scores the first goal of his reign as Bolton boss . He demonstrated his energy for management with a Mourinho-style dance down the line when Matt Mills headed Bolton in front in the first half. He ended up in the stands for leaving his technical area one too many times when Bolton won a late penalty, which Craig Davies missed. ‘A few times the lady (the fourth official, Amy Fearn) warned me,’ Lennon said. ‘I tried dealing with it with a bit of humour. I wanted to make a decent impression. ‘She said I was consistently doing it. But you have to understand it was my first game.’ And with it, Bolton are off the bottom of the table. ‘It is a start,’ Lennon said. ‘Let’s get out of the bottom three quick as we can. One out of one is all I can ask. For us it is a huge win - a clean sheet away and three points. I am delighted for the club.’ For Birmingham, it means they have now won only once in 11 games in all competitions. It is a run made more understandable when you consider how they defended in the first half here. Lennon took charge of his first game as Bolton manager on Saturday against Birmingham . Birmingham's Koby Arthur (left) and Bolton's Rob Hall battle for the ball during their clash on Saturday . Dean Moxey (right) tries to dispossess Birmingham's Arthur (left) at St Andrews . Time and again, they failed to mark in a competent manner. With deliveries of quality from Jay Spearing, it was only going to be a matter of time before they found themselves in a familiar situation. It was from a Spearing cross after 20 minutes that Mills headed past Darren Randolph for the winner. Yet this was as much a game where Birmingham could have taken a point, such were the chances they had. David Cotterill and Demarai Gray both hit the bar, while Gray drew two other good saves from Andrew Lonergan. ‘We are frustrated,’ said Birmingham manager Lee Clark. ‘It seems to be that way (at the moment). We don’t get our rewards.’ Randolph was sent off for fouling Craig Davies in the 83rd minute, prompting Lennon to leave his area to advise Spearing or Lee Chung Yong to take the penalty. He was sent off and the message didn't get through. What drama. Craig Davies (left) won a late penalty for Bolton after being brought down by Darren Randolph .

"Jose Mourinho says he believes Liverpool were everyone's favourites to win the Premier League last season, until Chelsea's refused to play their part as 'clowns at the circus' and ruined the day.

"Hibs head coach Alan Stubbs insists he’s confident he won’t be plunged into a goalkeeping crisis ahead of Sunday’s crunch derby with Hearts at Easter Road. Hull boss Steve Bruce has said the Tigers might have to recall shot-stopper Mark Oxley from his six-month loan in Leith after Steve Harper suffered an arm injury in Saturday’s 2-2 draw at Arsenal. Bruce is already without Allan McGregor who is not expected to return until next month with a shoulder problem. Speaking after the match at the Emirates, Bruce said: ‘We have a goalkeeper at Hibernian so maybe on Monday we will probably have to call him back.’ Goalkeeper Mark Oxley is on loan from Hull City, but Alan Stubbs believes he can't be recalled until January . But Stubbs reckons the English Premier League side can only recall Oxley, who has played in all of Hibs’ games this season, during a transfer window. ‘He can’t do it until January so that’s not something to worry about just now,’ said the head coach, who only has untried 19-year-old goalkeeper Kleton Perntreou as back-up. Meanwhile, on-loan Celtic playmaker Dylan McGeouch insists Hibs can use the visit of Hearts to launch themselves back into title contention. McGeouch helped Stubbs’ side rack up a 4-0 victory at Livingston on Saturday that propelled them into the play-off slot for the first time since the opening week of the season. Steve Bruce is in need of goalkeepers with Allan McGregor and now Steve Harper injured . Stubbs won Scottish Championship Manager of the Month, with Hibernian in fourth place . A League Cup win over Ross County and stunning triumph at Ibrox are part of a five-game unbeaten run that has lifted the mood ahead of the Edinburgh showdown. ‘We’re confident for next week and hopefully we can get a good result as well and push on for the top of the league,’ he said. ‘It hasn’t been the best of starts but we’re starting to put performances in and get the results now. We’re unbeaten in five but we need to start getting three points like we did on Saturday.’ Hearts are 14 points clear of fourth-placed Hibs but McGeouch, who added the third goal from the penalty spot, insists the gap is not insurmountable. ‘A win would definitely give us a boost in terms of trying to catch Hearts. If we can get closer to them and put in a wee challenge it would be great and good for Scottish football.’ Hull City's Harper receives attention from the physio during the 2-2 draw with Arsenal on Saturday . Hibs went ahead after 31 minutes with a helping hand from Lions goalkeeper Darren Jamieson. The shot-stopper spilled David Gray’s cross and Dominique Malonga pounced on the rebound. Jason Cummings then set up Danny Handling with a clever flick and he swept a drive into the corner of the net after 53 minutes. McGeouch scored the third with a cool penalty after Cummings was tripped by Craig Sives before sub Paul Heffernan completed the rout. Livingston boss John McGlynn, whose side now sit bottom on goal difference, said: ‘It’s a sore one but the best team won. Hibs are a better side than their league position has shown.’","Hibernian face Hearts on Sunday in the Edinburgh derby .

"Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson are part of an 11-strong 'task force' created to examine all aspects of the US Ryder Cup process in the wake of last month's defeat at Gleneagles. But the man praised by Mickelson as creating a winning formula, 2008 captain Paul Azinger, has turned down the chance to formally take part. In a statement on their website, the PGA of America said the task force would examine the selection of Ryder Cup captains and vice-captains, the qualifying system, the dates by which the team is determined and the timing of wild card selections. Tiger Woods attended a football game at Stanford, his alma mater - against Washington State on Monday . Woods was ruled out of the Ryder Cup in Scotland with injury but is now part of a US strategy task force . The American team have lost eight of the last 10 Ryder Cups: . 2014 - Gleneagles: Europe 16½ USA 11½ . 2012 - Medinah: USA 13½ Europe 14½ . 2010 - Celtic Manor: Europe 14½ USA 13½ . 2008 - Valhalla: USA 16½ Europe 11½ . 2006 - The K Club: Europe 18½ USA 9½ . 2004 - Oakland Hills: USA 9½ Europe 18½ . 2002 - The Belfry: Europe 15½ USA 12½ . 1999 - Brookline: USA 14½ USA 13½ . 1997 - Valderrama: Europe 14½ USA 13½ . 1995 - Oak Hill: USA 13½ Europe 14½ . 'The Ryder Cup is our most prized competitive asset and the PGA of America is committed to utilising our utmost energy and resources to support one of the biggest events in all of sport,' PGA of America president Ted Bishop said. 'The Ryder Cup Task Force, co-chaired by (PGA vice president) Derek Sprague and (PGA chief executive officer) Pete Bevacqua, is an exciting and comprehensive initiative that will guide the PGA in developing the right strategy and building ongoing processes and infrastructure for future generations of US teams.' In addition to Sprague and Bevacqua, the members of the task force are former captains Raymond Floyd, Tom Lehman and Davis Love, former players Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Mickelson, Steve Stricker and Woods and PGA secretary Paul Levy. Phil Mickelon's criticism of Tom Watson's captaincy caused a huge stir after the defeat at Gleneagles . Europe celebrated their eighth victory in he last 10 Ryder Cups in Scotland last month . Woods, who was not part of the team in Gleneagles, said: 'I think this is a great step by the PGA to accomplish what we all want - to win the Ryder Cup. 'The Ryder Cup is very important to every player who has the honour to represent his country. I'm excited to be part of this group.' Azinger is the only man to lead the United States to victory in the biennial contest this century and his approach was hailed by Mickelson in the US team's press conference in the immediate aftermath of the five-point loss in Scotland. The 43-year-old Californian also made implied - but strong - criticism of Tom Watson's leadership at Gleneagles in his comments. Azinger, 54, has not ruled out being captain for a second time but did not want to be part of the task force. 'I think Paul felt more comfortable with us talking in a small setting,' Bevacqua was quoted as saying by the Golf Channel. Lee Westwood, who made his ninth Ryder Cup appearance at Gleneagles, hailed the creation of the task force as positive news for Europe. 'What a massive pat on the back & confidence booster it is for Europe that team USA needs to create a Ryder Cup task force!!!' the former world No 1 wrote on Twitter. 'Maybe because Paul Azinger is not on this task force means he's in the frame for the next captaincy. Must be something the TF is discussing.'

"Toronado has joined the growing list of absentees from Qipco Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday. The prospect of testing going has prompted trainer Richard Hannon and owner Sheik Joaan Al Thani to switch the colt's target from the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes to the Breeders' Cup Mile at Santa Anita in California on November 1. Hannon is still expected to be doubly represented in the race with favourite Night of Thunder, this season's 2,000 Guineas winner, ridden by Richard Hughes and Toormore, the likely mount of Ryan Moore. Toronado, pictured being ridden by Richard Hughes, will not race at Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday .

But Harry Herbert, racing manager for owner Sheik Joaan's Al Shaqab Racing, confirmed the Breeders' Cup was now the intended target. He said: 'The decision has been taken today that, due to the ground, we will bypass Ascot a head for the Breeders' Cup Mile instead. 'He loves fast ground and conditions at Ascot don't look like they will suit. It's disappointing for us, and Champions Day, that he won't be running but we have to do what's best for the horse.

"Hull defender Curtis Davies believes Arsenal lack the 'strong, battling players' of Barclays Premier League title rivals Chelsea and Manchester City - and is glad they did not sign powerhouse midfielder Mohamed Diame when they had the chance. The Tigers were within minutes of inflicting defeat on the misfiring Gunners at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday, before England forward Danny Welbeck netted a stoppage-time equaliser to secure a 2-2 draw. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger accepted his side had failed to match Hull's aerial superiority, which was shown when Abel Hernandez headed the visitors into a 2-1 lead right at the start of the second half. Hull defender Curtis Davies (right) tries to shut down Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck at the Emirates Stadium . There was also little Arsenal were able to do to stop Diame marauding into the penalty area to quickly cancel out Alexis Sanchez's opening goal, although the hosts claimed Mathieu Flamini had been pulled back in the build-up, which Hull boss Steve Bruce dismissed as 'an individual piece of grappling'. Diame joined Hull from West Ham on transfer deadline day, the Senegal midfielder having long been linked with a switch to Arsenal. Davies is glad the move worked out in Hull's favour. Hull midfielder Mohamed Diame (right) was outstanding against the Gunners . 'Mo has been brilliant. His quality, his composure, he has definitely added to our squad. I was expecting a hustle-and-bustle midfielder, a strong, get-about player. I thought the goals would come but to get four in five is ridiculous,' said Davies. 'Arsenal were meant to get him on about two or three occasions. He nearly went there when he was at Wigan and when he was at West Ham. 'I am not sure if it was something to do with the medicals, so I don't know why it didn't happen - but I am delighted it didn't and that he came to us instead.' Steve Bruce's men looked on course to claim a 2-1 victory before Welbeck's stoppage-time equaliser . Davies believes Arsenal do lack something, but remain one of the most technically gifted squads in the Premier League, which was highlighted in the 13th minute on Saturday by Sanchez's excellent finish after cutting inside from the right. 'When you compare them to Chelsea and (Man) City, those two have got the quality as well as big, strong, aggressive, athletic players. When you look at Arsenal, I guess they have got the footballers, but you can't really see the strong, battling players,' he said. 'But with the football they play they don't really need that because if you have got the possession more often than not, you don't need to chase the ball and have big, battling midfielders. That is how Arsenal have always done it. 'They got to this level with Wenger playing this football and why should they change it now?'","Arsenal lack 'strong, battling players' of title rivals like Chelsea and Manchester City, says Hull defender Curtis Davies .

It's going to be a difficult week.' Poyet appeared to lay the blame on his players and did not feel it appropriate that he say sorry for their performance.

'I don't think I want to watch that again. Sometimes I make clips. I wouldn't have time to make as many clips as I need. 'Maybe the players will watch it.

We played great football, we scored great goals and it was a great afternoon.' The former Feyenoord boss also revealed he spoke to his opposite number after the game. He said: 'I know Poyet very well. At Spain we played a lot of times against each other, he at Zaragoza me at Barca. I said unlucky you didnt deserve this score. They played well at the beginning.

"If Saido Berahino makes it into the full England squad next month then nobody at West Brom will be more proud of him than James Morrison. After seven years at the club Scottish international Morrison is passionate about Albion's prospects – an attitude that spilled over last season during a furious dressing room row in which a punch was allegedly thrown at the young striker. In the fall-out to the incident there were fears that Berahino might try to force a move – and former player Peter Odemwingie claimed he'd been picked on during his time at the club. Saido Berahino (centre) is knocking on the England door after an impressive start for West Brom this year . James Morrison (pictured playing for Scotland in Poland) would be proud of Berahino if he earned the call . But as Albion take on Manchester United at the Hawthorns on Monday Morrison is unrepentant about the incident and says the club's senior players are not bullies but simply proud to set high standards. And with Berahino earning rave reviews as the Premier League's top English goal scorer so far, he revealed: 'We have just had a meeting about standards. The manager sets them really well and demands us as players to meet them every day. 'He starts it and we follow. I wouldn't say there is bullying involved, I just think it is professionals trying to be the best that they can be. 'The dressing room is 100 per cent a better place now. New players have come in and mingled really well, and we have got a few good leaders in there. 'And as for Saido, he has been terrific, his goal scoring speaks for itself. You give the lad a chance and he will put it away, he's proven that, and he's even stepping up for penalties.' Morrison has been at the heart of Albion's bright start to the season, played by new boss Irvine in a deeper role that he repeated with success for Scotland in last week's Euro 2016 qualifiers. Berahino starred for Gareth Southgate's England Under 21 side against Croatia last week . And he's relishing the football which Irvine, initially an unpopular choice among the club's fans, is encouraging the team to play. The 28-year-old said: 'We are trying to pass the ball a lot more. If you look at the Burnley game we played something like 600 passes. The Geeks in the back room say that was Barcelona standard. 'I think we had 11 new players as well as a new manager so it was going to take time, but everybody has got fit, we have a group who are willing to work for the manager. That's the start, and now we need to keep going. 'Everybody has gelled just on the training pitch. We've had a lot of fun, the coaching staff have put on good sessions, and that is how we have got together, as simple as that.' Now Albion aim to prove it after studying how Leicester shocked United's star-studded side in their last away game. Morrison said: 'We are working on some stuff going into the game thinking we can hurt them. We think that they love to go forward and that leaves some opportunities to hit them on the counter.'","James Morrison heaped praise on youngster Saido Berahino .

It has been difficult but he probably had to do a little better,"" said Claridge, who scored 42 goals in 120 games for Blues between 1994 and 1996. ""Yes, there are extraneous circumstances but he'll be disappointed. ""If you've not got the players then you say 'OK, fine' but the players have shown they are capable of winning games.

"Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has admitted his side were incredibly lucky to claim all three points against Queens Park Rangers on Sunday. The Reds were gifted the win in the 95th-minute when Steven Caulker turned the ball into his own net to make it 3-2 to Liverpool. Caulker's defensive partner Richard Dunne also scored an own goal to open the scoring for Brendan Rodgers' side. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch... Steven Gerrard admitted his side were lucky to claim all three points against Queens Park Rangers . Liverpool skipper Gerrard vented his frustration during his side's clash against QPR . QPR defender Steven Caulker scored a late own goal to hand Liverpool the victory on Sunday afternoon . Gerrard, speaking to Sky Sports moments after the dramatic finish to Sunday's encounter at Loftus Road, said: 'I am still in shock to be honest. We were very lucky to come away with three points. Our performance needs to be a lot better. We never gave up and got rewarded at the end. 'We are going to go away really happy but going forward we have to improve. Football is a strange game, I am sure Harry Redknapp is in shock as well. 'We conceded two sloppy goals. We are coming up against the best team in Europe [Real Madrid] over the next few weeks so we need to improve.' Gerrard's Liverpool team-mate Raheem Sterling, who has been making headlines this week for admitting he was tired while on international duty with England, added:  'We were not at our best but we hung in there and came away with three points. 'It is always good to play football and I am just happy we got the three points.' Raheem Sterling, who played a key role in Caulker's own goal, was happy to be playing football once again . Liverpool boss Rodgers echoed Gerrard and Sterling's comments and lauded  Redknapp's side. 'QPR didn't deserve to lose. We were very luck to get the win. We showed tremendous character but they certainly deserved something. 'We didnt pass the ball in the first half, our movement was too slow. Joe Allen and Philippe Coutinho coming on gave us a lift. 'Sterling was outstanding in his running and his quick thinking for the first goal. 'The best players come alive when the game goes dead, whether it's a throw-in or in the game. 'Some players look for a rest or try to get organised, but the bright players come alive. Brendan Rodgers was far from happy with his side's first-half display against the league's bottom side . 'He spotted it, played it early, it was a great run from Glen Johnson to invite the quick ball, and obviously a great cross that the defender turned in. 'And the breakaways for the other two goals, they are just all about his speed, his technique, his courage to carry the ball, run with the ball. 'It was great courage and cleverness from him.' Rodgers' opposite number Redknapp said he did not give a 'monkey's about speculation' surrounding his job while QPR striker Bobby Zamora blamed 'naivety' for his side's sixth Premier League defeat of the season. 'There was a lot of naivety. We should have got bodies behind the ball. It would have been good to go in at half-time with a lead but unfortunately the chances did not go in.

"Alan Irvine has never sought an explanation why he was left behind at Everton when his friend David Moyes took over at Manchester United last year and took other members of the Goodison Park backroom team to join him. ‘I was never asked and I didn’t expect to be asked,’ said West Brom head coach Irvine, who had worked with Moyes for eight years on Merseyside, first as assistant manager and then academy director in a second spell at the club. ‘David is a very loyal person and he would have wanted to look after the first-team staff he had at Everton. I was in the academy so I wasn’t surprised not to get a call. I’m glad the way things worked out for me.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alan Irvine: Berahino is an extremely talented player (archive) West Brom head coach Alan Irvine admits to not knowing what some of his players earn per week . The Scot can afford to be relaxed about it. Sitting in his office awaiting the visit of Louis van Gaal’s ‘new United’ on Monday night, he is enjoying his unlikely opportunity in the top flight limelight. Known as a hard-working and diligent coach, his days as a No 1 appeared over after being sacked by lower league clubs Preston and Sheffield Wednesday, despite a 40 per cent winning ratio at both. But when West Brom decided they could do with less drama after dressing-room fights and Nicolas Anelka’s infamous quenelle gesture last season, they turned to the healing powers of Irvine, who helped develop the talent of Wayne Rooney, among others, in his career. ‘It’s a chance I didn’t really expect but I’ve got unfinished business,’ says Irvine. ‘My other two jobs in management were extremely tough. I was at clubs where I had to do everything myself. ‘Preston only had one scout and Wednesday didn’t even have that. I’d spend my nights up and down the motorways checking on players and then have to go in the next morning bright and bubbly for training. Forward Saido Berahino (centre) has praised Irvine's personable approach to management this season . Irvine doesn't hold a grudge after David Moyes didn't offer him a role on moving to Manchester United . Irvine was sacked by both Preston North End (left) and Sheffield Wednesday after unforgiving tasks . ‘I once signed seven players while I was on holiday because the deals wouldn’t have been done otherwise. But West Brom is different. I can concentrate on what I do and enjoy best, working on the training pitch and analysing games. There are other people to do other things. ‘At Wednesday I did the contract negotiations but here I don’t even know what some of the players earn... and that’s fine by me.’ Irvine’s summer appointment underwhelmed many Albion fans who wanted a bigger, more experienced name. The dissenters were not exactly pacified by two draws and two defeats in Albion’s opening four games. But evidence the players were buying into Irvine’s methods were underlined by a run of three wins in a row against Tottenham, Hull and Burnley. They were unlucky to lose their last match 2-1 at Liverpool. England Under 21 striker Saido Berahino has emerged as the country’s hottest young striker with six goals this season under Irvine’s watchful eye. Last season Berahino stunned United and Moyes with the winner as Albion won at Old Trafford for the first time since 1978. Grey-haired Irvine may resemble a friendly neighbour rather than someone who would headbutt an opposing player or shove a rival, as other Premier League managers have done. But it would be wrong to dismiss him as a boardroom patsy simply because he carries the title of head coach rather than manager. ‘People make a thing of that but there’s no real difference between the power I’ve got compared with other Premier League managers,’ he says. ‘Yes, I am sure West Brom would sell a player I don’t want to lose if the price is high enough. But that happens everywhere. Do you think the Spurs manager wanted to sell Gareth Bale? Once a value is met, the club decide. ‘On signing players, the club were already down the line with Craig Gardner and Brown Ideye before I was appointed. But it doesn’t mean I don’t consider them my players. ‘Craig has been brilliant and played every game. I do my own research on potential targets. I rang Neil Lennon about Georgios Samaras because he knew him well from Celtic. The club take my views into account. We’ve pulled the plug on one or two if they’ve not been a good fit.’ Goalkeeper Ben Foster has continued his fine form between the sticks for the Baggies since Irvine's arrival . Berahino has gone on record that Irvine’s approachable manner has helped after losing his way under Pepe Mel. Also, centre-half Craig Dawson has become a regular after being overlooked by previous managers. ‘Craig wanted to go to Burnley in the summer, (but) I promised him if he got in the team and played well, I’d keep him in,’ said Irvine. ‘And that is what’s happened.’ The experience of older players Joleon Lescott, Gareth McAuley, Chris Brunt, Ben Foster and Jonas Olsson is also valued. Lescott, who left Manchester City in the summer, has been quizzed by Irvine about any useful tips picked up with the Premier League champions. Irvine has always been thorough, bordering on workaholic. But he accepts that learning when to switch off can be vital. For the first time, he has just taken a mid-season break, spending four days in Spain during the international fixture list. ‘Terry [Burton], our technical director, said I should go away, it was a new thing for me but I’m glad I did,’ he says with a smile. Irvine was heavily involved in bringing through a teenage Wayne Rooney at Everton over a decade ago . He has seen United live three times this season to prepare for Monday. ‘Of course they have fantastic players but every team has a weakness somewhere and it’s up to us to try and exploit it,’ he says. Rooney will miss the game with suspension and an additional bonus for Irvine is that several of his players have returned after positive results with their country, most notably the Northern Ireland trio of Brunt, McAuley and Chris Baird. United sacked Moyes and his assistants Steve Round and Jimmy Lumsden (who both followed him from Everton) after just 10 months and have changed half of their team since then, with stellar names like Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao and Daley Blind signing for big money. Loyally, Irvine feels he should have been facing his friend across the technical area. ‘David would have got it right at United, I am sure of that,’ he said. It is just another incentive for the Premier League’s most surprising manager to pull off another tale of the unexpected.","West Brom head coach has enjoyed a positive start at the Hawthorns .

"Walking through the notorious St Raphael’s Estate in the shadow of Wembley Stadium, 13-year-old Raheem Sterling took care to put an extra sweater over his QPR tracksuit on the way to training. To do otherwise would be to invite intimidation or even a beating. Not because of club affiliations but because blue was the ‘wrong’ colour according to gangs who controlled the estate. There are many similar stories which help explain why England’s most talked about footballer is such a potent mix of ability, stubbornness and vulnerability. Raheem Sterling is set to return to QPR when Liverpool travel to Loftus Road on Sunday . The 19-year-old has received heavy criticism after not starting England's Euro 2016 qualifier in Estonia . ‘We can all talk about his tough upbringing. He was the one living it,’ says his first footballing mentor, QPR youth coach Steve Gallen. ‘He had the talent which coaches see once in a lifetime, if they’re lucky. But he needed support and guidance. We only knew half of what went on, otherwise we would have tried to help him even more.’ On Sunday, 19-year-old Sterling is due to return to Loftus Road for the first time since he left four years ago to join Liverpool, a move he admits was motivated by a need ‘to get out of London’. Assuming Brendan Rodgers feels the teenager can cope with the emotional baggage of the day, Sterling will arrive at his old ground with a higher profile than the Prime Minister. He has been caught in the middle of a slanging match between club manager Brendan Rodgers and England boss Roy Hodgson over whether he was too tired to start for his country in Estonia. England manager Roy Hodgson (left) and Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (right) have had a war of words . Sterling started England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia in Tallinn on the bench . The Liverpool star played in the 5-0 win over San Marino at Wembley the Thursday before . Gallen, who is still at QPR as Under 21 head coach, remembers vividly the first proper game he saw Sterling play in. ‘It was an Under 12 match against Wycombe,’ he says. ‘Wycombe would score, Raheem would score, Wycombe would score, Raheem would score. It was ridiculous. ‘I think Wycombe ended up winning 5-4 against our one-man team. When I got back to the club, I said I’d just been watching Raheem Park Rangers. He was totally running the show.’ Even then, there was another side to the skinny little kid who was vulnerable and defiant at the same time. Gallen adds: ‘I remember how good he was because of his athleticism and brightness, but when someone kicked him, he walked off crying. ‘It wasn’t the physical stuff that caused it. I’d go over to him and say, “Look, you can’t walk off, come on”. But he wasn’t really hurt by the foul, he was hurt because of losing. ‘He knew the rest of the team weren’t on his level. He was thinking, “I am trying so hard, scoring all these goals and they are letting them in, making me lose”.’ It was not long before every club in the country knew about Sterling. But his spiky, immature attitude was well-known, too. Concessions about his behaviour were made at QPR, who knew his story, a Jamaican-born kid who moved to London at the age of five, lost his father early and whose mother — with whom he was close — was often too busy caring for the rest of the family to watch Raheem play. Sterling played 120 minutes in Liverpool's Capital One Cup tie against Middlesbrough that went to extra-time . The area surrounding Wembley Stadium in north London where Sterling grew up . For most other clubs, however, Sterling represented a major risk. Remarkably, when he was put up for sale at 15, only two clubs — Liverpool and Fulham — backed up their interest with firm bids for England’s most talented teenager. ‘Arsenal, Chelsea, Spurs, they all knew about Raheem. But their attitude was: “Too small, too much baggage”,’ says Gallen. ‘At the time, I wanted him to stay at QPR. I persuaded the reserves to give him his debut at 15 so he’d feel he was being fast-tracked. But at one meeting, after training, Raheem said “Steve, I have to go”. ‘I could see how genuinely upset he was and I thought, “I can’t do that to a kid”, so we reluctantly agreed to listen to offers. ‘Now, with hindsight, I can see it was the right thing for him to leave, as much for a change in environment off the pitch.’ Andrew Whorms, 20, who played schools football with Sterling, believes his friend’s upbringing has played a key part. ‘He is humble. He took all the pressure that was on him and put it into his football,’ he says. ‘He’s worked hard; never took no for an answer. He’s got his reward and he deserves it. ‘A lot of people don’t realise how hard it is to get on in football. A few of us managed to stay in there and get a long way and he’s worked for everything. He was never afraid to take things in his own hands.’ Sterling moved to England from Jamaica aged five, and grew up on the St Raphael's Estate . A young Sterling in action for the QPR youth team before he made his move to Liverpool . When Fulham initially bid just under the £500,000 asking price to try to get a bargain, Liverpool had a clear run for the winger. What a bargain he looks now. He has already achieved more at Anfield, good and bad, than most players manage in a lifetime. His thrilling club form earned him a place in England’s World Cup team, where it is generally regarded he superseded Wayne Rooney as England’s best player. Less positively, an appearance in court just over a year ago earned a reprimand from Rodgers about his lifestyle, even though assault charges against an ex-girlfriend were dropped. He is a father now and can provide a lifestyle he himself never had. He hasn’t lost his feelings for QPR. ‘He texted me two days after we won the play-off final at Wembley to get into the Premier League,’ says Gallen. ‘He’d been at the match, gone there quietly and watched in one of the corporate boxes. My seven-year-old son can’t wait to meet him, so we’ll go down to the Liverpool dressing room afterwards.’ If Sterling plays, his every move is bound to be analysed for signs of fatigue. Hodgson claimed he had left Sterling on the bench in Tallinn because the player said he’d felt tired. Liverpool have turned on the England manager in fury despite Rodgers warning about the dangers of burn-out all season. Paul Lawrence, a football coach at Sterling’s old school which is now known as the ARK Elvin Academy . There are other factors at play that have helped the issue escalate. Rodgers is furious that his striker Daniel Sturridge was injured on England duty and Hodgson is resentful at the way he was treated as Liverpool boss during his brief, disastrous spell at Anfield. The 67-year-old also has an awkward personal relationship with Sterling, finding his teenage ways irritable. Liverpool and England team-mate Glen Johnson, who himself fell out with Hodgson at Anfield, has come out strongly in support of Sterling and says the player has been misrepresented, presumably by his international manager. ‘The way it’s been presented, Raheem was asking for a lie down. But obviously anyone with half a brain would know that’s not the case. He’d play every week if he can,’ says Johnson. ‘He was asked a question “How does he feel?”, and he’s said his thighs were tired. There is a difference between aching and demand a break from games to actually saying “I’m tired and I can’t play”. ‘You are never 100 per cent, certainly not when you are playing games every four days, you are going to play with knocks and pain and aches. I think club and country should support him, support young players. With Raheem, he is still growing, so he is going to have a demand on his body.’ The ARK Elvin Academy in Wembley where Sterling used to go to school . A certificate from 2007 which shows Sterling winning a Year 7 boys' high jump competition . So, what next for Sterling? A new deal at Liverpool is being talked about but remains unsigned. Interest from Real Madrid is genuine but not yet backed up by hard cash. QPR must hope Liverpool do sell in the summer. They would be entitled to 25 per cent of the fee, which would be about £60million on current market value. But Sunday afternoon is about remembering where it all started for Sterling. Paul Lawrence, football coach at Sterling’s old school, now known as the ARK Elvin Academy, says: ‘Raheem is an inspiration. He has gone to the highest level and that allows other kids here to dream. He’s a 19-year-old boy from Brent and he proves that if they’re serious and put in time and effort, they can achieve what they want. ‘There are so many I know who lose heart and stop playing football and don’t even play on the park with their mates any more. Raheem was different.’ His school pal Whorms adds: ‘In PE, the goals were tape on the walls of the gym and at lunchtime we’d put down bags and play in the cage with a tennis ball. ‘We saw them knock down the old Wembley and the new one coming to life. For a lot of us, it was always our dream to play inside. Raheem did it. He’s got true grit.’","Liverpool star set to return to QPR on Sunday in Premier League clash .

"Gus Poyet says he hates the trend of footballers betraying dressing-room secrets in their best-selling books.

Poyet, though, will not be writing his own memoirs, nor will he be reading Keane’s. ‘I’m sorry Roy, I won’t be buying your book,’ he said. ‘I enjoy telling stories when I am having dinner or a barbecue – that’s the best part of fans and friends listening to you telling a story, but not going public like that.’ And, on the subject of dressing-room music, he added: ‘I went to see Mamma Mia and I enjoyed it. But no, I don’t have an ABBA CD. ‘We still have music in the dressing-room. They boys decide between themselves and I haven’t heard anything that has upset me. ‘Me? I like to talk, so too much music means I cannot talk. But I also think the music can hide the silence in the dressing-room. If there is silence you sometimes worry as a manager. Music can bring a bit of atmosphere and I don’t mind that.’ Former Manchester United stars Wes Brown and John O'Shea will form Sunderland's defence against Saints . Poyet, meanwhile, will pair Wes Brown, 35, with his former Manchester United team-mate John O’Shea, 33, at the heart of Sunderland’s defence on Saturday. O’Shea signed a two-year extension to his current contract this week and Poyet is delighted with his veteran duo. ‘I think the hunger is the most important thing,’ he said. ‘When you win, win, win, you can relax, but these two are not that type of characters. That’s very good because they want to keep playing, keep fit and keep helping the team. ‘The way they conduct themselves is exactly what you want to see from your senior players.’","Sunderland manager does not like footballers writing their memoirs .

"Bayern Munich maintained their unbeaten start to the season after hammering Werder Bremen 6-0 at the Allianz Arena in the German top flight. With winger Franck Ribery making his comeback as a substitute on the hour, league leaders Bayern were in complete control with Philipp Lahm and Xabi Alonso giving them an early two-goal cushion. With Werder unable to counter the Bavarian attacks, a 43rd-minute penalty from Thomas Muller and Mario Gotze's shot two minutes later killed off the game before half-time.

"Per Mertesacker remains confident Arsenal's consistent performance levels will eventually see them claw back lost ground in the Barclays Premier League title race. The Gunners looked set for a comfortable afternoon when they took an early lead through a fine finish by Alexis Sanchez against Hull at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday, only to quickly be pegged back by a controversial equaliser from Mohamed Diame, who looked to have pulled Mathieu Flamini in the build-up. A lapse in concentration at the start of the second half saw Abel Hernandez - drafted into the starting XI following injury to Nikica Jelavic in the warm-up - head the visitors in front. Per Mertesacker claims he has seen enough of Arsenal to know they can climb back up the table . Arsene Wenger's side, who have been hit by a series of injuries, continued to press as Hull sat deep, but appeared set to be frustrated before Danny Welbeck swept the ball home in the first minute of stoppage time. Arsenal, who came from 2-0 down to beat Hull in the 2014 FA Cup final, almost snatched victory during the additional six minutes added on by referee Roger East as full-back Kieran Gibbs ghosted in at the far post, but he was denied by a point-blank save from substitute goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic. It is now just one victory in their past seven league matches for Arsenal, who were beaten at Chelsea before the international break and find themselves 11 points adrift of the leaders. Mertesacker, though, feels he has seen enough in recent performances to believe Arsenal can soon build some momentum of their own. Danny Welbeck lifts the ball past substitute keeper Eldin Jakupovic to hand Arsenal a crucial point against Hull . 'We have to take the responsibility for that, to have dropped points again, but what really makes me confident is the way that we play at the moment, because no matter what happens, we just carry on and have great potential, that just has to come out much more,' said Mertesacker, who captained the team on Sunday with Mikel Arteta on the bench following a calf injury. 'We started really well and put the pressure on them, did a great job to score that opener and were really confident to keep on going like that, but they came back all of a sudden. 'For me, the decision (to disallow the first goal) was clear, everybody had stopped already because he pulled Mathieu Flamini seriously, but the referee thought it would be his strength which had brought him back into the action. Arsenal's vice-captain believed Hull's first goal should have been disallowed for a foul on Mathieu Flamini . 'Afterwards, we kept on going, even after they had scored the second. With the crowd together, we were able to come back and draw that match. 'We nearly scored a third, which would have been more lovely, but at least we have one point and good morale.' Flamini knows Arsenal 'have to fix something' if they are to challenge. 'We will try to find a solution for the next games,' he said. 'At the moment we are having a bad period, but we didn't lose. 'We came back, so it was great character and very important to recover well with another game on Wednesday (away to Anderlecht in the Champions League).' Alexis Sanchez was a bright spark for Arsenal in front of their fans, but even he showed his frustration . Bruce revealed he had opted against starting with Hernandez because of the Uruguayan's travel schedule during the international break, one of several Hull players away. 'We deserved maybe to hang on, but a lot of them have been all over the world this week and we were running on empty,' he said. 'The first goal was an individual piece of grappling, maybe we have got a (fortunate) decision, but you don't get many of them at Arsenal so it was a good one to have, but I would rather talk about our second goal because it was an excellent team goal.' Hull will assess Jelavic and also defender Michael Dawson (ankle), but goalkeeper Steve Harper looks set for an extended spell on the sidelines with the torn bicep which forced Bruce to introduce Jakupovic.

"West Brom head coach Alan Irvine insists Manchester United are still a force and warned his side to treat them with respect. The Baggies host United on Monday and Irvine reckons the former champions are still a top draw. United chief Louis van Gaal has seen his side lose 5-3 at Leicester and stunned 4-0 in the Capital One Cup by MK Dons already this season.

'When the fixtures come out most people up and down the country look to see when they are playing Manchester United at home.

'They will work the ball out and we've got to make sure they don't get moves started easily,' he said. 'We've done our video work and there are clips of them scoring goals where it starts with the goalkeeper and ends up in the back of the net. 'Clearly that involves a lot of control and a lot of movement and good positioning of their players. 'We've got to be really well organised when we don't have the ball in order to stop them building these attacks.

"Bernie Ecclestone has surprisingly been denied a place on the Formula One board, a snub that casts doubts on his future as the sport’s all-powerful Svengali. Although grand prix’s octogenarian puppeteer walked free from a German court in August after a prolonged bribery trial, he has failed in his attempt to win back his place at Delta Topco, the board comprising the sport’s shareholders. Sources have told Sportsmail that when the board met they insisted on conditions being imposed on Ecclestone’s return. Bernie Ecclestone will not be returning to the board of formula one despite the end of his bribery trial . Some within the sport are said to be unhappy about the adverse publicity Ecclestone's trial has brought . The sport's boss paid £60million to end the trial with his innocence intact in August of this year . The delay undermines Ecclestone’s bullish back-to-business mantra, summed up by his post-trial declaration: ‘I shall follow my old idea in life, “Don’t get mad; get even”. I haven’t got mad, but I am going to get even.’ It also contradicts his insistence in January, when he stepped down from Delta Topco to fight the accusations in Munich, that he would return in total command the moment the case was resolved. He paid £60million to end the trial and left with his innocence intact. However, several shareholders were embarrassed when a High Court judge described Ecclestone as an ‘unreliable witness’ in a civil action earlier this year. The wildest, but not necessarily ill-informed, rumours suggest that Ecclestone could be discarded within a fortnight. It remains equally likely that his critics on the board are trying to impose rules to govern his future conduct in the business. Either way, it seems, he no longer has carte blanche to act as he wishes. However, even though he turns 84 at the end of the month, Ecclestone is showing no inclination to give in to time or pressure. The Formula One season moves on from Singapore to Japan, with Lewis Hamilton in the championship lead . Ecclestone had insisted that it would be business as usual after his trial, but things may not be as simple . Ecclestone’s long-term protector and greatest admirer has been Donald Mackenzie, the chairman of Formula One’s majority owners CVC. An affable man in private, Mackenzie is publicly reticent to the point of invisibility. He declined to comment. As did Ecclestone, who is not expected at Sunday’s Japanese Grand Prix but will be in Sochi, Russia for the inaugural grand prix there next week. Yesterday the Land of the Rising Sun was a blanket of rain and cloud, with Typhoon Phanfone expected here at the end of the weekend. Despite that, and with not a single car running, the main grandstand was full. They adore Formula One here, a love affair that started when James Hunt drove through life-threatening rain in Fuji 1976 to beat Niki Lauda. The typhoon has been gathering potency in the western Pacific Ocean and is due to arrive in mainland Japan, possibly during the grand prix. The FIA’s latest weather forecast indicates it will strike either very late on Sunday or on Monday. But some rain, at least, is expected to interrupt the race. Lewis Hamilton seemed affronted when it was suggested he did not want a wet race in Japan this weekend . There is no chance of the main event being moved to Monday. This travelling circus is scuttling off to Sochi with barely time to pack, as it is. Ecclestone’s right-hand man, Pasquale Lattuneddu, is missing the Japanese race and will go straight to Russia to make sure everything is shipshape for his master and his master’s big buddy, President Putin. Neither of the two world championship participants, Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, view the rain as entirely unwelcome. ‘The more the better,’ said Rosberg, who trails Hamilton by three points after an electrical problem in Singapore a fortnight ago. As for Hamilton, two of the most stellar drives of his career were victories in the wet. In Fuji in 2007, when the safety car literally almost ran out of fuel because it stayed out for 19 long laps, and at Silverstone the following year. He was understandably indignant when he was asked how he fared in bad conditions, replying: ‘Have you not been watching Formula One for the last eight years?’ Along the paddock at Ferrari, Fernando Alonso could not commit to the team or, indeed, to a move away. The smokescreen, mirrors and conjecture surrounding his future was, it was suggested by a French journalist, being whipped up by Alonso’s manager Flavio Briatore. Ferrari’s PR chief nodded knowingly as the old bronzed plotter’s name was mentioned. Cash-strapped Caterham, who were recently bought out by an unidentified ‘consortium of Swiss and Middle Eastern investors’ said that they are planning to race despite bailiffs seizing items from their Oxfordshire factory this week.","Ecclestone walked free from bribery trial in August .

Alexandru Epureanu's header earned Moldova a surprise 1-1 draw with Russia in Moscow, paving the way for Austria to take the top spot in their European Championship qualifying group. Russia struggled to break down a dogged Moldovan defence until the 73rd minute, when Artyom Dzyuba earned and converted a penalty following a foul by Victor Golovatenco. Moldova responded within seconds of the restart as Epureanu headed home from Alexander Dedov's corner.

Sydorchuk, on target as a substitute in the 2-0 win away to neighbours Belarus on Thursday, finished off a swift counter-attack in added time at the end of the first half. The speedy Evgeny Konoplyanka created the goal with a cross to the far post with Sydorchuk arriving to fire in from close range. In Vienna, the Pakistan-born, half-Nigerian Rubin Okotie's 24th-minute goal won the game for Austria against a flat Montenegro side. Montenegro went into the qualifying group with hopes of reaching Euro 2016, but had already been struggling after an opening win over Moldova was followed with a goalless draw against Liechtenstein last week. Ukraine's players head back to their own half after celebrating Serhiy Sydorchuk's goal . Diego Costa fluffed his lines in the first half, but the Chelsea forward did eventually get on the scoresheet . Diego Costa ended his long international scoring drought with the third goal in an uninspiring 4-0 win for Spain away to minnows Luxembourg in Euro 2016 qualifying Group C on Sunday. Brazil-born Costa had failed to find the net for his adopted country in six previous appearances but broke a duck lasting more than 500 minutes when he netted from close range in the 69th minute in a rain-lashed Luxembourg City. David Silva opened the scoring in the 27th minute with a fine long-range strike and set up Paco Alcacer to make it 2-0 three minutes before half time. Substitute Juan Bernat added the fourth two minute from the end. Without captain Zlatan Ibrahimovic for a second straight game, Sweden struggled to convert their chances but still beat Liechtenstein 2-0 in their Group G Euro 2016 qualifier at the Friends Arena on Sunday. Jimmy Durmaz pokes the ball past Lichtenstein goalkeeper Daniel Kaufmann to put Sweden 2-0 up . Slovenia's players celebrate after scoring; Lithuania,though, remain second in the group . Erkan Zengin broke the deadlock after 34 minutes with his second goal in three qualifying games, his thumping shot taking a deflection off a defender and looping over the goalkeeper into the net. Jimmy Durmaz doubled Sweden's advantage in the first minute of the second half, stabbing the ball home from close range after Bicer horribly sliced a left-footed clearance into his path.

"New signing Toni Kroos has said playing for Real Madrid is a 'step up' from Bayern Munich and that he moved to Spain to win trophies. The former Bayern Munich man signed for a fee thought to be £24m after failing to extend his contract with the German champions. Kroos has had considerable success for a player of his age, having already won 13 major trophies including the World Cup, Champions League, World Club Cup and German title.

"One of the men accused of murdering honeymooner Anni Dewani appeared in court today looking frail and refusing to reveal his face. In bizarre scenes, Xolile Mngeni, who is suffering from a malignant brain tumour, was told his trial will begin on Wednesday. Speaking at a pre-trial hearing at the Western Cape High Court in South Africa, Judge Robert Henney said he would accept no further delays in the case against Xolile Mngeni. Mrs Dewani, 28, was shot in an apparent car hijacking while on honeymoon with her husband Shrien in Cape Town in November 2010. South African Xolile Mngeni, pictured shielding his face with his jacket in court, will go on trial on Wednesday in Cape Town, South Africa, accused of murdering honeymooner Anni Dewani . Shrien Dewani, a 32-year-old care home owner from Bristol, is accused of arranging the contract killing of his wife, which he denies. He is currently being treated by psychiatrists in Britain while he fights extradition to South Africa. Dewani had married Swedish national Anni Hindocha in India before taking her on a honeymoon to South Africa which included a safari in the Kruger Park and a visit to Cape Town, where they stayed at the five-star Cape Grace hotel. During an evening out, Mrs Dewani was killed by a shot in the neck after an apparent car hijacking in Gugulethu township. The court heard today that a recent medical report confirmed Mngeni, one of two men accused of the contract killing, was fit to stand trial, even though he had a malignant brain tumour. His lawyer Matthews Dayimani said the report concluded his client's 'attentional focus' was slightly reduced. Happier times: Shrien Dewani (left) is accused of arranging the murder of his wife Anni (right) Anni Dewani was killed on the second night of her honeymoon in Cape Town by armed robbers who hijacked the couple's taxi . Frail: South African Xolile Mngeni, left,  hides his face with his jacket as he walks with a policeman to the dock from holding cells at court in Cape Town . Mngeni looked frail today and had to be led in through the public entrance by a policeman . Judge Henney said it would be costly to order transcripts of proceedings, but he would see if an exception could be made. He suggested Mngeni sit next to his lawyer during the trial, taking notes where possible, and consult during adjournments. Mngeni looked frail today and had to be led in through the public entrance by a policeman as the courtroom was not linked to a basement holding cell. Guilty: Mziwamadoda Qwabe has admitted to the murder of Anni Dewani . He leaned heavily on a walking frame, using one arm to keep a jacket wrapped around his face. A frenzy ensued when several photographers jostled around the benches to get to him. His trial had been set down until the end of the court term on September 21. The prosecution originally intended calling 16 witnesses, but this is likely to be whittled down after his co-accused Mziwamadoda Qwabe's confessions, which implicated Mngeni. Dayimani said he was still waiting for the witness list and media footage. The prosecution said all footage had been handed over. Mngeni faces charges of kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances, murder, and the illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition. Qwabe pleaded guilty to the same charges last week as part of a plea bargain. He was sentenced to 25 years in jail. The plea bargain offered insight into the apparent sequence of events on the night of the murder and implicated Shrien Dewani as the conspirator in a contract killing. Qwabe said he and Mngeni agreed to the job in exchange for 15,000 rand (about £1,200). He alleged Mngeni pulled the trigger. Shrien Dewani has repeatedly denied the allegations against him. He is being treated in the UK for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. At the end of July, his lawyer Claire Montgomery told Westminster Magistrates' Court that keeping her client under medical treatment in the UK for 12 months would speed up his recovery and sending him to South Africa would jeopardise it. The hearing was adjourned to September 18 for a psychiatrist to examine Dewani and give the court more information about his condition. Only then would a decision be made on whether he was fit to stand trial in Cape Town, the court heard.","Court rules Xolile Mngeni is fit to stand trial, even though he had a malignant brain tumour .

"West Ham are facing a huge battle to keep starlet Reece Oxford after Chelsea joined the race to land the teenage defender. The 15-year-old is viewed as one of the Hammers' best emerging talents and has been likened to former academy graduate Rio Ferdinand. Sportsmail revealed earlier this month that Arsenal are chasing the central defender. Tough: West Ham face a battle to keep Chelsea (manager Jose Mourinho pictured) target Reece Oxford .

"Atlanta Hawks general manager Danny Ferry has been disciplined by CEO Steve Koonin for making racially charged comments about British forward Luol Deng when the team pursued the free agent this year. The team did not provide any details of the discipline. Atlanta's WSB-TV reported it obtained a letter from Hawks co-owner Michael Gearon Jr. which cites Ferry telling the ownership group that Deng 'has a little African in him' and was 'a two-faced liar and cheat.' Punished: Atlanta Hawks general manager Danny Ferry was disciplined by the team for racist remarks . Target: Ferry said that Britain's Luol Deng 'has a little African in him' Power: Michael Gearon Jr (left) and Bruce Levenson . Hawks spokesman Garin Narain said the team's investigation of Ferry's comments uncovered the racially inflammatory email written by co-owner Bruce Levenson. That discovery led to Levenson's announcement on Sunday that he will sell his controlling share of the team. Ferry apologised on Tuesday but said he was only repeating comments he had heard about the Sudan-born Deng. 'In regards to the insensitive remarks that were used during our due diligence process, I was repeating comments that were gathered from numerous sources during background conversations and scouting about different players,' Ferry said in the statement released by the team. 'I repeated those comments during a telephone conversation reviewing the draft and free agency process. Those words do not reflect my views, or words that I would use to describe an individual and I certainly regret it. I apologise to those I offended and to Luol, who I reached out to Monday morning.' In his letter to Levenson, Gearon compared Ferry's comments to comments made by former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who was forced to sell the team this year when his racist comments were disclosed. 'We believe these comments by Ferry were far worse than Sterling's because they were not from a private personal conversation - they were in a business environment on a business matter in front of a dozen or more people,' Gearon wrote. 'If Ferry would make such a slur in a semi-public forum, we can only imagine what he has said in smaller groups or to individuals.'

"Manchester City are showing interest in Keiren Westwood. The goalkeeper, 29, is a free agent after leaving Sunderland and would aid City's home grown quota. Sunderland are keen on former City keeper Costel Pantilimon and have revived interest in Hamburg's Rene Adler but the German has damaged knee ligaments. The Premier League champions have already confirmed the signings of former Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna and are expecting to anounce the signing of Brazilian midfielder Fernando. Making up the numbers? Keiren Westwood would provide Manchester City with another homegrown player . Sagna has joined City on a free transfe, signing a three-year deal worth Â£150,000-per-weekÂ  - inclusive of add-ons and bonuses. As revealed exclusively by Sportsmail in May, the 31-year-old will officially join City on July 1 - ending his seven-year spell with the Gunners. City failed with a bid to sign Fernando in the January transfer window, but appear to have finally landed the Porto midfielder. Manuel Pellegrini has been interested in the 26-year-old for some time and sees him as the ideal player to assist Yaya Toure and Fernandinho in central midfield next season, as City try to challenge on four fronts.

"Roberto Di Matteo takes over the managerial reins at Bundesliga club Schalke 04 this week. He is not in for an easy ride. The Italian, who has spent two years in the wilderness since being fired by Chelsea in 2012, has received a three-year contract at Schalke, with the club’s chief executive calling him 'a coach with international experience, who will bring us forward'. Di Matteo, though, has experienced the brutal nature of managership before at West Brom and Chelsea, and he should not expect to be cut any more slack at Schalke. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Di Matteo gives his first Schalke 04 press conference in German . Roberto Di Matteo (centre, reading his pad) is confident of success having taken over at Schalke . Di Matteo shakes hands with Schalke striker Chinedu Obasi during an open training session . Di Matteo will be assisted at Schalke by former Crystal Palace star Attilio Lombardo . Di Matteo has been out of work since leaving Chelsea in 2012 after winning the Champions League . Di Matteo directs his players during an opening training session in Gelsenkirchen . Roberto Di Matteo (left) shakes hands with Schalke 04 general manager Horst Heldt on Wednesday . Nationality: Italian . Age: 44 . Clubs manged: MK Dons (2008-09), West Brom (2009-2011), Chelsea (2012), Schalke (2014-) Major honours: 1 Champions League, 1 FA Cup (both 2012) Far from being the epitome of a steady German ship, the Gelsenkirchen club can be as trigger happy as Roman Abramovich, having had eight managerial changes in the last six years. If things don’t go well for Di Matteo, he could soon be the ninth casualty. His predecessor, Jens Keller, was expected to leave at the end of this season anyway, so Di Matteo’s appointment is without doubt an emergency measure. Schalke, whose financial situation and wealth of coveted young stars mean that Champions League football is essential for them, are currently languishing in 11th place, with a chronic inability to beat lesser teams. Di Matteo needs to change that fast if he is to survive more than half a season in Germany. He is highly respected in Germany, largely due to the way his Chelsea team beat Bayern Munich in the 2012 Champions League final. He was also linked with the Eintracht Frankfurt job last summer. But doubts remain as to whether Di Matteo will be able to change Schalke’s fortunes. A poll on the website of local paper WAZ revealed the majority of Schalke fans are entirely unsure as to whether the club have made the right decision in replacing Keller. A major worry for the pessimists is the fact that Di Matteo shares many similarities with his predecessor. The Italian lifts the Champions League trophy after winning it as Chelsea manager in 2012 . Di Matteo is thrown up in the air by the Chelsea squad after winning the FA Cup, also in May 2012 . Julian Draxler is Schalke's star man and was part of Germany's victorious World Cup squad . Di Matteo has been out of management for nearly two years after being sacked by Chelsea in November 2012 . Both Keller and Di Matteo are tactically astute, but both have had problems in the past dealing with big egos in the dressing room. Keeping the likes of Kevin Prince Boateng onside often unsettled Keller, and Di Matteo will have to prove he has learned the lessons from his time at Chelsea and can be a much more authoritative force than Keller has been. Should he navigate the first year unscathed, the Italian will have a chance to build something impressive at Schalke. The club has produced some impressive young players such as Julian Draxler, Max Meyer and Sead Kolasinac in recent years and there is a foundation to be built upon. Without Champions League football, however, those talents would almost certainly be heading for greener pastures. That is why Schalke have let Keller go. That is why Schalke need Di Matteo to make an immediate impact. If he doesn’t, the German side will prove to be no more merciful than West Brom or Chelsea.","Roberto Di Matteo appointed Schalke 04 manager earlier this week .

"The Ospreys opened their Champions Cup campaign in emphatic fashion by posting a bonus point 42-7 victory over outclassed Liberty Stadium visitors Treviso. Wales fly-half Dan Biggar ran the show, kicking 17 points and orchestrating Ospreys' best attacking moments as full-back Dan Evans touched down twice, while wing Jeff Hassler, scrum-half Rhys Webb and number eight Dan Baker also scored tries. Treviso wing Ludovico Nitoglia scored a late consolation try, converted by former Worcester and Wasps fly-half Joe Carlisle, but there was little for the Italians to cheer on another dismal European occasion for them. Dan Evans scores his second, and Osprey's fifth, try of the match in what was a routine win over Treviso . It meant the unbeaten Guinness PRO12 leaders took early charge of Pool Five, teeing up nicely next Saturday's clash against reigning Aviva Premiership champions Northampton at Franklin's Gardens. Saints will start as favourites - they beat Ospreys twice in last season's Heineken Cup - but Biggar and company can head to the East Midlands confident of making an impression. The only worrying note on an otherwise routine afternoon was Wales autumn squad hopeful Baker being carried off midway through the second period after suffering what appeared to be a neck injury. There was a 10-minute stoppage while Baker received attention from medics. Dan Biggar ran the show, kicking 17 points and orchestrating Ospreys' best attacking moments . Treviso, back in Swansea little more than a month after they suffered a 44-13 PRO12 defeat against the Ospreys, were soon under pressure when Biggar sparked a brilliant counter-attack from deep inside home territory. And although Treviso halted that move, two successful Biggar penalties during the opening eight minutes hinted at a long shift to come for the lowest-ranked team in this season's competition. There was a fluency about Ospreys' play and after Biggar completed his penalty hat-trick inside 13 minutes, their opening try arrived shortly afterwards following strong set-piece play, slick handling and a neat Biggar pass than sent Hassler over. Biggar added the conversion, and Ospreys were well on their way to a potential bonus-point victory, leading 16-0 early in the second quarter of a one-sided encounter. Dan Baker was carried off midway through the second period after suffering what appeared to be a neck injury . Treviso's cause was not helped by the loss through injury of captain Antonio Pavanello, and they were then temporarily reduced to 14 players when Pavanello's replacement Marco Fuser was sin-binned by French referee Pascal Gauzere for pulling down a maul deep inside his team's 22. Ospreys then kept up the pressure, and Webb sniped his way over for a sixth try in seven starts this term - form that suggests he will strongly challenge Mike Phillips to wear the Wales number nine shirt against opening autumn Test series opponents Australia on November 8 - and Biggar's conversion made it 23-0. The Ospreys forwards looked to maintain their grip in the second period, and their dominance led to a further Treviso indiscretion that saw substitute prop Salesi Manu yellow-carded, which as with Fuser's caution cost the visitors dear. Justin Tipuric of Ospreys is tackled by Treviso's Italian No 8 Alessandro Zanni . Within a minute of Manu's exit, the Ospreys struck for their third try when Evans grounded possession underneath a pile of bodies, and Biggar's conversion left Treviso 30 points adrift with more than 30 minutes remaining. The bonus-point try arrived with just 54 minutes gone as Treviso's defence found itself scattered to all parts, enabling Baker to enjoy an unopposed run-in before Biggar maintained his 100 per cent success rate by landing a seventh successful kick from seven attempts. Baker's injury did not noticeably disrupt the Ospreys' rhythm, and their fifth try arrived 17 minutes from time following a sharp break and a superbly-timed scoring pass by the impressive Webb to an unmarked Evans. Treviso showed plenty of commitment and desire, despite the scoreline, but their technical, tactical and skill limitations mean it will be a major surprise if they win a European game this season, especially as their other pool opponents are Northampton and Racing Metro. With the game long done as a contest, Ospreys head coach Steve Tandy had all eight of his substitutes on well before the end, including Wales internationals Justin Tipuric, Aaron Jarvis and Duncan Jones, but he knows the European campaign is about to crank up considerably as Northampton lie in wait.","Ospreys beat Treviso 42-7 in their Champions Cup opener .

"Borussia Dortmund's nightmarish start to the Bundesliga season continues. After eight games, the Champions League finalists of 2013 have notched up a mere seven points, and conceded fourteen goals. Defeat to newly promoted Cologne on Saturday meant that they were unable to haul themselves off a miserable 14th place in the table. No wonder Jurgen Klopp looks more exasperated with each passing weekend. Neither the charming sense of humour nor the defiant bursts of anger are anywhere to be seen at the moment. Klopp simply looks at a loss. 'We're playing a kind of football which doesn't make any sense. Our passing is dreadful, we're making simple mistakes. There are various explanations for it,' he said after the defeat to Cologne. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Koln 1-1 Borussia Dortmund: Ciro Immobile opens scoring . German giants Borussia Dortmund have made a nightmare start to their domestic season . Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp could not prevent his side slipping to another defeat at the weekend . Japan international Shinji Kagawa (centre) looks devastated at the full-time whistle against Cologne . Ciro Immobile (left) scored for Dortmund in their 2-1 Bundesliga defeat by Cologne on Saturday . Dortmund won back-to-back Bundesliga titles in 2011 and 2012 (pictured) Those explanations are difficult to identify, though. It would be easy to think that it was a personnel issue. Dortmund have lost Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski to Bayern Munich in the last 18 months, and players like Marco Reus, Ilkay Gundogan and Henrikh Mkhitaryan are only just returning from injuries. Gundogan aside, however, the absentees are all forwards. Dortmund's problems are not in their attacking play, where new signings Ciro Immobile, Adrian Ramos and Shinji Kagawa have proved themselves to be reasonable replacements. It is in defence that Klopp's team are becoming a laughing stock. 'We're constantly creating chances, and most of the time we're converting chances. That's usually enough to win games,' said Klopp. Dortmund were hampered by injuries to Marco Reus (left) and Ilkay Gundogan ahead of the season . He is right. Dortmund's defence has been an eight-episode comedy box set of errors this season, complete with sloppy passing, dreadful positioning and embarrassing individual mistakes. The defence has not been overrun by superior opposition, it has gifted goals to significantly weaker teams like Hamburg, Mainz, Stuttgart and most recently Cologne. That last defeat sparked an angry response from director of sport Michael Zorc. 'We're seeing serious slip-ups from players who are supposedly leaders,' he ranted. It was quite clear to whom he was referring. Mats Hummels, newly crowned captain and target of many a Premier League club, has failed catastrophically to organise a coherent back line this season. It isn't just Hummels, of course. As Klopp says, the whole team has a problem at the moment. The coach has taken primary responsibility, but insists he is staying in his job: 'If I thought for a moment that I was somehow the thing disturbing the team, I would say, ""thanks guys, it's been great, but my time's up"". But I don't think that.' Dortmund captain Mats Hummels (right) has been scrutinised for his side's defensive problems at the back . Klopp is certainly in no danger from above. His success with the club over the last few years means he has a lot more breathing space than most coaches, and rightly so. Even the media are not on his back. One opinion piece in WAZ even said that Dortmund 'can be relaxed, even in crisis'. There are also some positives to be taken from the Champions League. Dortmund top their group after two games, and look an altogether different team when playing in Europe, as Arsenal found to their dismay last month. A victory over Galatasary on Wednesday would be exactly the kind of thing Klopp's side are in need of. A confidence boost, but also a reminder that if they are going to be playing in the same competition next season, they had better get their act together in the Bundesliga.

"TweetDeck was hacked Wednesday after an Austrian programming teenager made a cute love heart symbol. The teen, whose name is Florian, said he discovered early yesterday that '&hearts' made a heart symbol in HTML and in turn created an opening in TweetDeck's software. This allowed someone to inject computer program commands via a tweet, in other words a software bug. 'It wasn't a hack. It was some sort of accident,' he told CNN, choosing to withhold his last name. He tried it again, and again, until he made it create a pop-up on his own TweetDeck dashboard. He then announced 'Vulnerability discovered in TweetDeck. \o/' before informing Twitter about the problem. Alert: The teen, who's name is Florian, said he discovered that '&hearts' made a heart symbol in HTML and in turn created an opening in TweetDeck's software. It was then abused by @derGeruhn, pictured . But it was too late. A hacker with the handle @derGeruhn had already attacked the vulnerability causing more than 40,000 users to automatically, involuntarily, retweet a cryptic line of code. That account belongs to a 'single, strange, arrogant' German programmer and college student named Andy Perdana. Perdana, according to the Washington Post, has been on Twitter with the handle @derGeruhn since 2012, a year after he began studying computer science at the University of Applied Science in Karlesruhe, Germany. He’s contributed code to online gaming projects on Github, and maintains a profile on the encrypted messaging site Keybase. And @derGeruhn later Wednesday tweeted that his message was a prank. Meanwhile, Florian, who goes by Firo, feels terrible about the whole thing. 'It's horror that TweetDeck made that mistake,' he told CNN. 'It's horror that [hackers] are using this issue. I don't know. I'm sad in a way.' Twitter was forced to shut down its popular application for several hours following the major security alert. Users of the Tweetdeck Chrome plugin were greeted with this message after hackers found a flaw in its code . The vulnerability allows attackers to place computer code in a tweet. Once the tweet appears inside TweetDeck, the code can run actions and be re-tweeted to other accounts, further propagating the problem. Users of the Chrome browser version of . the app reported getting random pop-up windows containing messages such . as 'Yo!' or 'Please close now TweetDeck [sic], it is not safe.' he firm took to Twitter to acknowledge the bug, first saying 'We've temporarily taken TweetDeck services down to assess today's earlier security issue,' it said. 'We'll update when services are back up.' Earlier in the day, Twitter pushed out a code fix that was supposed to close the security hole but did not. At that point the company tweeted 'A security issue that affected TweetDeck Wednesday morning has been fixed. 'Please log out of TweetDeck and log back in to fully apply the fix.' However, it is believed the problem continued, until the firm later tweeted: 'We've verified our security fix and have turned TweetDeck services back on for all users. 'Sorry for any inconvenience.' Experts say the flaw could have been used to steal data. 'Cross site scripting or XSS is a type of exploit that usually works in a website or a web application. It allows the attacker to run a script on the users device, which makes XSS vulnerability so dangerous,' said George Anderson, of security firm Webroot. The firm took to Twitter to acknowledge the bug following complaints from users . 'The script is able to send any sensitive information accessible from within the browser back to the hacker, so a potential attacker can gains access to the user’s private information – such as passwords, usernames and card numbers.' He advised users to log out of the app and remove their saved passwords as a precaution. 'As Tweetdeck is a web app, signing out might help to contain the infection, as long as users devices are not already infected. 'Because XSS steals the cookie sign-on information, users should get rid of all saved passwords, as well as sign-in again on a secure browser session and change their logins. 'It's also best not to use TweetDeck as long as it remains infected.' TweetDeck is a free download for desktop computers, iPhones, Google's Android devices and the Google Chrome browser. The software allows users to organize their Twitter streams and offers a more user friendly view of Twitter feeds. Twitter bought TweetDeck in 2011 for about $40 million.

"Rafael Nadal will keep on playing at Wimbledon even if it risks shortening his career, according to the 14-time grand slam winner's coach Toni. Nadal's uncle said the clay-court supremo, on a revenge mission against his one-time conqueror Lukas Rosol on Thursday, will not countenance avoiding Wimbledon in a bid to lessen the damage to his long-term knee problems. Toni Nadal said on Wednesday that the two-time Wimbledon winner has shaken off a host of knee-joint concerns to approach this year's tournament in rude health. That's more like it: Rafael Nadal got off to a winning start against Martin Klizan of Slovakia on Tuesday . The nine-time French Open king suffered a first-round exit last year and second-round slump in 2012. He has encountered pain when playing on grass in the past, but the world No 1's coach said playing and winning Wimbledon was a lifelong 'dream' that Nadal will not forego at any point in his career. 'Last year he lost in the first round, and it's the same - we want to play here,' said Toni Nadal at a Lavazza Coffee event. 'For us it's very important to play here, it's a dream for us. 'When Rafael was young my dream was that he could win at least once here. Every year when we come here it's a dream, and we'll try to keep coming. 'If we play bad this year we'll come back next year, so still we have a little chance to make a good tournament when we come here. 'When he's good, his knees and his body, then grass court is a good court for us, and he is good now. 'We'll always come back, the knees are not an issue in that, sometimes he has played with problems in the past, and we could do that again.' All smiles: Goran Ivanisevic, Toni Nadal, Judy Murray and Guiseppe Lavazza at Wimbledon on Wednesday . Nadal will face Rosol, knowing exactly what to expect. The Czech knocked him out at the same stage in 2012, causing a stunning upset, and Toni Nadal admits Rosol poses a tough assignment for his nephew once again - but confirmed his 28-year-old charge from Mallorca is ready for the challenge. 'You want to play here, and it's a special tournament,' said Toni Nadal. 'People said Rafael doesn't play well here, but maybe that's because people have a short memory. 'We made the final in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2011. 'Five finals and then we have problems, with the knees.' Toni Nadal joined Judy Murray and Goran Ivanisevic to hand out free coffee to fans queuing for Wimbledon tickets. The coach of 14-time grand slam winner Nadal said humility remains central to his nephew's success. 'It's unbelievable when I see some players when they think they are so high in the sky,' said Toni Nadal. 'To be modest you need to be somewhere between special and stupid. Relief: Two-time champion Nadal celebrates his first win at SW19 in two years on Tuesday . 'Rafa is not special or stupid. Only the people who are stupid enough think they are high in the sky. 'Rafa is a normal man, he knows that if he were here now, he's just like you, like me, like everybody, no problem. 'It's not about being modest, it's about thinking how other people are. And Rafael is good at only one thing, and this thing is playing.' Nadal is closing in on Roger Federer's record haul of 17 men's grand slam titles, but Uncle Toni said: 'We don't think about four more, or the record. 'We have many fantastic victories - anything more would be amazing.'","Nadal is two-time winner at SW19 but has twice lost in first round in recent years and has history of serious knee injuries .

"Hearts officially exited administration on Wednesday and brought to an end one of the most painful and worrying periods in the club’s history. Now the priority is to fight their way back to Scottish football’s top flight under the stewardship of Ann Budge. With Hibs and Rangers vying for the Championship title next season that will be no easy task. Saved: Hearts owner Ann Budge, left, and Foundation of Hearts chairman Ian Murray MP, right, celebrate the club's exit from administration alongside Jordan McGhee . But when the very survival of the club was in doubt for much of the last 12 months, Wednesday’s announcement was another reason for optimism for Hearts fans. In a statement, new owner Ann Budge said: ‘By now you will have all heard and, yes, it's true, we have formally exited administration! ‘Everyone associated with the club is ecstatic and now we can really begin to  move ahead in implementing our plans for the future. ‘So what now? Well, the first thing is to get season tickets on sale as quickly as possible and the club will be issuing information regarding this tomorrow. ‘Following this, we will shortly be issuing information on new signings and more pre-season friendlies which, I know, is what all the fans are desperate to here. ‘However, for today, let's just celebrate the news!’ Building: Budge says she wants to move the club forward and has big plans for the future . Ian Murray MP, chairman of Foundation of Hearts, added: ‘We are obviously delighted. We were always looking forward to this day and we were hoping it would have come a lot sooner, but we were never confident until (administrators) BDO left the Court of Session with the paperwork all signed,  sealed and delivered to say the club is officially out of administration and can progress towards fan ownership. ‘I am naturally a fairly optimistic person at the best of times but even the most optimistic person would have, at various points along the way, feared this  day was not going to come and that we should prepare for the worst-case scenario. ‘But to be fair to BDO they have used all their skill and professionalism to  push things through and deal with all the frustrations to reach this historic  day for Hearts. ‘It’s important to stress that this is not the end of the process, it’s the start of the process of rebuilding the club, a club which has been hollowed out by the previous owners, and it’s now about getting the finances healthy again  and getting the team back into the Premiership. ‘But Hearts fans are the same as supporters of other clubs, we want to be  talking about football and this means we can get on with that.’ Difficult: Coach Robbie Neilson will have a tough job turning the club's fortunes around in the Scottish First Division . FoH have already ploughed £1million into the club to help clear over £500,000 of football debt taken on by Budge’s new regime and the organisation’s more than 8,000 monthly contributors will finance £1.4m over the next two seasons. Surplus cash raised by FoH will be banked to allow the fans to pay off Budge’s  £2.5m ‘loan’ within the next five years and give the supporters full control of a club brought back from brink. Joint administrator Bryan Jackson, who has now successfully overseen the administration exits of Hearts, Dunfermline, Dundee and Motherwell, was a satisfied man last night after finally being able to pass the club back to new owners with the prospect of a bright future ahead. He said: ‘This has been a challenging and complex process which has, fortunately, had a successful conclusion. ‘In entering into an administration you can never be sure of the outcome and it is often a case of dealing with the day-to-day issues whilst also pushing for the final goal of exiting administration. ‘There have been many people involved with this process over the last year and many have lived and breathed every minute of this administration in their efforts to produce this result. ‘I would again like to thank Ann Budge and her team at the club, the Foundation, the fans, Peter Duff and all at Morisons LLP for their outstanding legal advice and patience, as well as the staff at BDO who have all put up with  a lot to ensure the great name of Hearts survives to fight another day.’ Best interests: Hearts director Craig Levein has had to oversee drastic cuts made at the club to safeguard its future .","Hearts exit administration and can begin to plan for fiscally secure future .

During another, the spider decoy glows in the light from the camera, which also acts to highlight its long, spindly legs. Following the initial discovery, Torres contacted Linda Raynor, an arachnologist at Cornell University, . who agreed it was an unusual find. She told Wired it was likely to be an . unidentified species. Even . among the decoy-building species of Cyclosa, she said, decoys with legs . and the web-shaking behaviour have not been observed before. After . speaking with experts, Torres returned to the trails around . Tambopata and found a further 25 specimens of the novel spider in the . same floodplain. The spider (pictured left in close up) was first spotted in 2012 in Peru, and was later found separately in the Philippines by entomologist Lary Reeves. Biologists are curious as to how two similar creatures, so far apart, have both managed to evolve this defence mechanism . Biologist and science teacher . Phil Torres discovered the spider in September 2012 as he led tourists in a . floodplain around Tambopata River in the Peruvian Amazon. After speaking with experts, Torres returned to the trails around Tambopata and found a further 25 specimens of the novel spider in the same floodplain . William Eberhard, an entomologist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute who studies web-building, said he had never before seen a structure like the ones found in the Amazonian. Cyclosa are known for decoy building, but most of their constructions are clumpy rather than something which resembles and actual spider. 'Known Cyclosa don’t have that spider-with-leg looking thing, which is why we think it’s a new species,' Torres said. He hopes to return to the area in January with a permit to collect samples, in preparation for submitting a study and getting the new species officially recognised. The spider was also found separately in the Philippines by entomologist Lary Reeves in March 2012.

"Liverpool midfielder Suso is facing two months out with a groin injury. The 20-year-old, who is poised to join AC Milan next year, travelled to Switzerland for Wednesday's 1-0 defeat to FC Basel in the Champions League but did not make the substitutes' bench. Suso made his first appearance of the season when he came off the bench to score in last week's League Cup tie with Middlesbrough but has aggravated a groin injury and will undergo surgery next week. Liverpool forward Suso confirmed the news of his groin injury by posting a picture on his Instagram account .

"This was never going to live up to last season’s sensational semi-final at Twickenham but, as opening Pool games go, it really was very good. Saracens have been unable to reach the stratospheric heights they touched that day, when they routed the French giants in April with one of the most astonishing English club performances ever witnessed. Back-to-back defeats in domestic and European finals proved a bitter pill to swallow. But Saturday’s bonus-point win over the star- studded Top 14 outfit proved that performance was no fluke and reminded everyone that Mark McCall’s team are likely to be serious contenders again this season. This was precisely the sort of advert the European Champions Cup organisers had in mind when they streamlined the competition. David Strettle impressed for Saracens as they beat Clermont 30-23 in the Challenge Cup . Chris Ashton is congratulated by his team-mates, both England wingers scored two tries on Saturday . Six tries from wingers and two wonderful fly-half displays —although, sadly for Stuart Lancaster, not from Owen Farrell — and some typically thunderous defence left the crowd delighted. Charlie Hodgson was outstanding as he played all but five minutes of the match before being replaced by Farrell in his first game for a month following a quad injury. Two penalties and two conversions were Hodgson’s haul, but his all-round contribution in the pivotal No 10 position deservedly earned the 33-year-old former England fly half the man-of-the-match award. It will be hard to omit him against Munster at Thomond Park on Friday night, however much Lancaster would love Farrell to have more time on the field ahead of the autumn internationals. ‘Charlie’s been good all season and I thought he was good again,’ said McCall. ‘We’ll always do what’s best for the team but we’ve also got a plan in place which you’ll find out on Thursday.’ Ashton goes over for a try during the match at Allianz Park . The likelihood is that Farrell —whose knee was heavily strapped — will start next week. But Hodgson has done his side proud once again in the younger man’s absence. ‘We’ve been to Thomond Park a few times over the years and not come away with very much,’ said Hodgson. ‘But we’ve definitely come on over the past couple of years and we’ll see if that’s enough.’ In David Strettle and Chris Ashton — who scored a brace of tries each — Saracens also possessed two razor-sharp wingers. And their pack, led manfully by captain Alastair Hargreaves, proved a match for the hulking giants from the Massif Central. ‘The two of them have been in outstanding form for quite some time,’ said McCall. ‘Not just this season but for the past 18 months. It depends what you want to do with England. Do you want to go for youth or do you want to go for experience? You’d be doing well to find two better finishers. Strettle will be unlucky not to be selected in the England squad after his performance . ‘I’m just chuffed we showed this energy and intensity against a high-class team like that. They are the best team we’ve played all season.’ Scrum half Richard Wigglesworth was also on top of his game for the home side, creating Strettle’s first try with a superb, darting break and kicking intelligently. ‘He’s definitely the form scrum half in England and I hope Stuart Lancaster and his coaches agree with that,’ said McCall. ‘What he did for the second try was brilliant. He’s playing some great rugby.’ Ashton and Strettle both scored a try in each half with the sides going in at the interval level at 10-10. Charlie Hodgson was the man of the match on Saturday after a fine outing . Zac Guildford had touched down and Clermont’s excellent fly half Camille Lopez kicked a penalty and a conversion. After the break, Strettle’s second try was world class, courtesy of sublime footwork in a tight space down the left-hand touchline. Ashton crossed again on 63 minutes, just seconds after Sebastien Vahaamahina’s try had been ruled out for crossing, as Saracens took a seven-point lead which they held until the end. The only downside for Saracens was a nasty-looking knee injury suffered by substitute hooker Schalk Brits when his boot stuck in the artificial Allianz Park pitch surface as he attempted to step off his right foot. Saracens insist the composite rubber crumb pitch is no more dangerous than a normal grass playing track but McCall’s unnecessarily prickly response to legitimate questions about the subject seemed overly defensive.","Chris Ashton and David Strettle both scored two tries at Allianz Park .

"Brendan Rodgers heaped praise on Raheem Sterling after the wonderkid powered ‘lucky’ Liverpool to a dramatic 3-2 win at QPR. Sterling — who has been at the centre of controversy after complaining of tiredness ahead of England’s win over Estonia — had a hand in all of Liverpool goals, with Steven Caulker’s own goal in the dying seconds securing three points for the visitors. Rodgers said: ‘He (Sterling) was outstanding. (He showed) his brightness for the first goal. The breakaways for the other two are all about his speed, his technique, his courage to run with the ball.’ Raheem Sterling helped Liverpool record a narrow 3-2 win over QPR at Loftus Road on Sunday afternoon . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers heaped praise on his team, but admitted they were fortunate . Roy Hodgson was at Loftus Road on Sunday, but Rodgers said that he did not speak to him. Hodgson insisted, however, that there is no issue between himself and the Liverpool boss. ‘There’s no problem with Brendan. There’s no problem with the player (Sterling),’ said Hodgson. ‘There’s no meeting planned with Brendan. I’ve left messages for him.’ Sterling’s match-winning performance helped overshadow an uncomfortable defensive display from Rodgers’ side ahead of their Champions League clash with Real Madrid on Wednesday. Liverpool took the lead through Richard Dunne’s 10th Premier League own goal before a manic last eight minutes. Eduardo Vargas levelled for QPR, then Coutinho put the Reds back in front. Vargas equalised for a second time but Caulker’s nightmare finale handed Liverpool the win. ‘I thought we were fortunate,’ admitted Rodgers. ‘We have to let it go, we will learn from it, analyse the game and look back on it. QPR defender Steven Caulker scored a late own goal to hand Liverpool victory on Sunday afternoon . England manager Roy Hodgson was in the stands and sat in between Les Ferdinand and Tony Fernandes . ‘But Real Madrid are playing as well as they have played for the last five to 10 years. The quality they have... and they are the reigning champions. ‘So I really look forward to that and I know the players won’t be overly happy with how they played. But the character and attitude of the team, I don’t think anyone can question that. ‘We have got our three points and we will look to improve.’ Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard also said that Liverpool were very lucky to come away with three points . His captain Steven Gerrard agreed, saying: ‘We would have had no complaints if we came away with nothing, we would have no complaints if we came away with a point. ‘I think we’re very lucky to come away with three points.’ Meanwhile Rodgers, despite admitting he can’t replace Luis Suarez, has backed misfiring striker Mario Balotelli to find his form after another frustrating afternoon.But the Liverpool manager added: ‘It’ll drop for the boy, the most important thing for me is his work rate. The guy is doing his best and working really hard. ‘He is seen as the direct replacement for Luis. And as I said before, Luis is irreplaceable. A real world-class talent and that is not what is being asked of Mario. ‘He has come in and wants to improve. It is not going to happen overnight.’ Mario Balotelli endured another frustrating day as his wait for a first Premier League goal for Liverpool goes on .

"If you regularly check your Facebook account, respond to messages and like posts you could be an easy target for cybercriminals. In a recent study, researchers subjected students to phishing attacks on Facebook, using a fake profile. They discovered that the majority of regular Facebook users will accept fake friend requests, but  those who use the site habitually are more susceptible to fraud and phishing attacks. Students at the University of Buffalo were asked to participate in an online survey about technology use, including how often they used Facebook, and how concerned they were about security and privacy. Each student was then sent a fake friend request, followed by a phishing message . The research was carried out by Dr. Arun Vishwanath, author of the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication study. He asked 150 students at the University of Buffalo to participate in an online survey about technology use. Recent research by Kaspersky Lab discovered the number of internet users who faced phishing attacks over the last 12 months has grown from 19.9 million to 37.3 million, an increase of 87 per cent. Facebook, Yahoo, Google and Amazon are among main targets of cybercriminals. Phishing is a form of Internet fraud in which criminals create a fake copy of a popular site -an email service, a banking website, a social networking site, or more - and try to lure the users to these rogue web pages. The unsuspecting user enters their login information and passwords into these forged websites as they normally would, but these access credentials are instead sent to the cyberiminals. Buried among the questions were measures to determine each student’s Facebook usage, habitual Facebook use, total size of their Facebook social network, and their concern for privacy. Six weeks later, each student was sent a friend request from a fake Facebook account, created specifically for the study, and all requests were sent to the 150 students within minutes of each other. A further two weeks later, all the subjects who accepted the fake friend were sent a Facebook message from the fake profile. To appear similar to a phishing email attack, this message had a grammatical error and a deadline in the body of the text. The phisher stated that someone he knew was looking for interns, and that interested individuals should respond within three days with their student ID number, email user name and date of birth. The majority of students who used the site regularly accepted the fake friend request. But, only the most habitual users fell victim to the phishing attack. The phishing messages (pictured) stated that someone the user knew was looking for interns, and interested individuals should respond with their personal details. The majority of students who used the site regularly accepted the fake friend requests, but, only the most habitual users fell victim to the phishing attack . ‘In social media platforms such as Facebook, messages sent within the platform show the picture of the sender,’ said Dr Vishwanath. ‘It is conceivable that habitual Facebook users see the pictures, presume it is from a friend, and automatically respond to such requests without considering how they are connected with the person, how long they have known him, or who else is connected to that individual. ‘Perhaps being connected to a large number of people makes it difficult to discern a friend from a stranger; or frequently interacting with the platform makes individuals more likely to overlook the nuances in the message that might reveal deception. ‘Hence, habitual Facebook users appear significantly more likely to be inattentive and automatically provide the information requested by a phisher.’","Students were asked to participate in an online survey about technology use .

Midfield: Adam Lallana . Attack: Rickie Lambert . 'For me I was so happy to see that because he deserves it but obviously I'm also sad that he has left. He has proven himself in every league, especially in the Premier League that he is more than capable of being one of the best players. He's a great goalscorer and his all-round play is brilliant.' It remains unclear when Rodriguez will be back in action for Southampton, who are also on the lookout for a new manager after Mauricio Pochettino left for Tottenham, but he is pleased with the progress so far. 'It's going really well,' he added. 'I'm hitting my targets and working hard. It has been kind of enjoyable so far so it's quite good. The first thing I can think of is to get back and have a season playing again, that first game is what I'm looking for.

"Paul Keating unleashed a scathing assessment of his relationship with former Prime Minister Bob Hawke claiming he basically ran the country in the nude while Mr Keating did most of the work. Mr Keating, a former Prime Minister himself, said he ran the country for five of the nine years Mr Hawke was in office while he served as his Treasurer between 1984-89. He added that Mr Hawke regularly sunbathed in the nude by the pool at the prime minister's Canberra residence, even when cabinet ministers had come around to talk about important issues. Scroll down for video . Former Australian Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating (left) has launched a scathing critique of fellow former PM Bob Hawke (right) during his reign from 1984-89 . Mr Keating's comments came as he launched the diaries of Gareth Evans, a former Labor minister, in Canberra on Wednesday. The diaries give an account inside the Hawke Keating Government between 1984-86 and Mr Keating used segments of the book to critique his testing relationship with Mr Hawke, including having to talk to him in the nude. 'I'd arrive at The Lodge at 10.30 and find Bob sunning himself by the pool,' Mr Keating told the launch audience, according to News Corp. Mr Keating (right) who served as Mr Hawke's (left) Treasurer says he pushed the government's agenda from 1984-89 . Mr Keating said Mr Hawke regularly sunbathed in the nude by the pool at the prime minister's Canberra residence, even when cabinet ministers had come around to talk about important issues . 'He often used to do this nude.' He even recalled joking about the size of Mr Hawke's manhood. 'I did have a few things to say about midgets... on the occasion, but this is not the occasion for elaborating,' he said. 'Gareth and I went out there is suits one day, sweating, and there's Bob in the nude.' After one particular meeting, Mr Keating recalled Mr Evans saying 'it does take a certain chutzpah' to meet ministers in the nude, Fairfax reports. Mr Keating's comments came as he launched the diaries of Gareth Evans (right), a former Labor minister, in Canberra on Wednesday .

"The hype over tennis's ""next big thing"" Nick Kyrgios exploded in Australia on Wednesday as news of the teenager's stunning upset of 14-times grand slam champion Rafa Nadal at Wimbledon broke. Once a global superpower in the sport, Australia has waited in vain for a new men's talent to take the mantle from an ageing Lleyton Hewitt and 19-year-old Kyrgios's stylish advance to the Wimbledon quarters propelled a tidal wave of accolades from former players, Hollywood celebrities and politicians. 'Extraordinary performance @NickKyrgios. Australia couldn't be prouder of you - what a win & what an amazing attitude!' Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott tweeted. Aussie rules: Kyrgios looks in disbelief as he celebrates his shock win over Nadal . Stunned: The world No 1 was overwhelmed by the power and finesse of his teenage opponent . 'Aussie Aussie Aussie @NickKyrgios. Such composure and class! But hard off to @RafaelNadal ... one of the greatest of all time!' Australian actor Hugh Jackman also posted on Twitter. A lead story on all of the major news networks and websites, Kyrgios's hopes of ""keeping it real"" may be undermined by the constant comparisons to other barnstorming teenagers of yesteryear. Where American great John McEnroe saw in Kyrgios a 17-year-old Boris Becker on the rise, Australian doubles great Todd Woodbridge gleaned a young Pete Sampras. Australia's 1987 Wimbledon champion Pat Cash likened Kyrgios to another big-server with Greek heritage in Mark Philippoussis, the twice grand slam finalist. The outrageous between-the-legs winner that Kyrgios finessed from the baseline to leave Nadal flat-footed was seized upon as proof the 144th-ranked Kyrgios had the confidence and the game to mix it with the world's greats. Proud: Australian A-list actor Hugh Jackman tweeted his delight at Kyrgios' win . By Royal appointment: Jackman watched the match from the Royal Box at Wimbledon . National hero: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott was also quick to congratulate Kyrgios . 'The ""tweener"" perfectly summed up Kyrgios's approach at Wimbledon - fearless, fun and a finesse-to-firepower ratio to match it with the world's elite,' News Ltd media enthused. Amid the feverish hype, Kyrgios's vanquished opponent struck a rare note of caution. 'For me it's very easy to say he can be top 10. I think he can do. It's not an issue that I think he can not do it,' said Nadal. 'But when we see a young player that arrives to the tour and plays a great match or plays a great tournament, people say he will be the next big star. 'Some things are right - sometimes arrive, sometimes not. So it depends how the things improve over the next couple of months, years, for him. So if he is able to keep improving, he will be. If not, will be more difficult.' Australia has previously been tantalised by the exploits of a rangy, local teenager who stormed into the quarter-finals at Wimbledon. In with a shout: Kyrgios is through to the quarter-finals at SW19 . Bernard Tomic's exhilarating run to the last eight in 2011 as a care-free 18-year-old was seen as the springboard to a top-10 ranking and grand slam success. Now 21, Tomic, who was dumped from the second round by Czech Tomas Berdych, is ranked 86th in the world and has not since advanced beyond the fourth round at the majors. Compared to Kyrgios, now glowing in the light as the ""golden boy"" from Canberra, Tomic's brand has been tainted by a string of controversies. He was kicked out of the Davis Cup team for attitude problems and stuck by his hot-headed father-coach John Tomic, who was convicted by a Spanish court of assaulting his son's former hitting partner last year. False dawn: Bernard Tomic (above) has not been able to kick on since breaking through in 2011 . 'The last couple of years have been tough for Aussie tennis fans as we've watched Bernard Tomic occasionally show his talent, but mostly abuse it, mock it, waste it,' wrote one News Ltd critic prior to Kyrgios's Nadal clash. 'Yet still we've cheered for him, hoping against hope that it's surely just a matter of time until his infantile mind catches up with his oversized body. 'Hasn't happened yet and maybe it never will. Either way, it now scarcely matters because Nick Kyrgios is No 1 in our hearts. 'This likeable young Canberran has a lovely vibe about him. He's aggressive but controlled, a killer on the court and a puppy dog off it.'","Australian Nick Kyrgios beat Rafael Nadal in four sets .

"Men across the country will be sporting a colourful look on their fingernails for the first two weeks of September as the the Polished Man campaign kicks off to raise awareness of violence against children. Participants, who will wear nail polish on one of their fingers, include AFL player Chris Judd, Logie award winner Gyton Grantley from Underbelly, Aria award winner Dan Sultan and Tripple M's Anthony 'Lehmo' Lehmann. Grantley, who began to show his support a little earlier than required, told Daily Mail Australia: 'I'm already sporting a nice kind of pink with blue sparkles on top'. Scroll down for video . Underbelly's Gyton Grantley and AFL star Chris Judd are two of the ambassadors for the Polished Man campaign who will wear nail polish on one finger from September 1-15 to raise awareness of Child abuse . 'I've been wearing it everyday and that's the great thing about the campaign - you don't often see nail polish on a man and it definitely prompts the question of why you're wearing it from others and that results in the exclamation of why and really brings the campaign to life.' The campaign is largely focused on getting men to participate as approximately 90 per cent of all violence committed against children is perpetrated by men. As a result, the campaign aims to encourage men to challenge their mates on 'what it means to be a man' and to not accept violence, as well as painting one fingernail to represent the one-in-five children globally who experience violence. The idea sprung from the founder and CEO of social change advocacy group YGAP, Elliot Costello, who met 10-year-old Thea while in Phnom Penh, Cambodia last year. The idea sprung from the founder and CEO of social change advocacy group YGAP, Elliot Costello (left) who met 10-year-old Thea (right) while in Cambodia last year . Thea was rescued from a safe house by Hagar International after suffering from abuse there. She and Elliot (right) became friends during his stay and before he left she painted his nails (left) Thea suffered physical and sexual abuse at the hands of a paedophile for two years while at a 'safe house' where she was taken after her father passed away. She was eventually rescued by Hagar International and upon meeting Mr Costello who was working alongside the organisation, built a strong relationship with him. The inspiration for the Polished Man campaign came the day before Elliot left Cambodia, when Thea drew a love heart on his hand and painted his fingernails. Grantley revealed that his decision to become an ambassador for the campaign came from his exposure to similar experiences. The campaign asks men to paint one fingernail to represent the one-in-five children globally who experience violence . 'I've done charity work in Thailand for World Vision and I've also worked in the slums of Nairobi in Kenya for Oasis Africa, so I've done work for children over there and seen quite in depth some of the experiences they've been through,' Grantley said. 'More importantly it's in our own backyard and basically one in 29 children, or one kid in every class is being abused and we might not be aware of it or know it. 'What's important is to raise more awareness and encourage more conversations amongst ourselves, to bring the subject more light.' The mechanics and salesmen at Heritage Motors in Maitland have also decided to take part in the charity event . The workers held a barbecue for staff and clients to raise money and will have their nails painted for the fortnight . One group of men who are proud to be displaying their colourful fingernails over the next fortnight are the mechanics from Heritage Motors in Maitland. The Service Operations Manager, Rob Reeve, told Daily Mail Australia that everyone from the salesmen to the tow-truck drivers have painted their nails bright pink and purple. 'Matt the tow-truck driver came up with the idea to get involved and it just snowballed from there and everyone got involved - the salesmen, all the service staff, the whole dealership got behind it,' he said. In Australia, one in 29 children - or one child in ever classroom - experiences some form of abuse . The campaign is largely focused on getting men to participate as approximately 90 per cent of all violence committed against children is perpetrated by men . 'They are all young fellas and they just want to say not to that sort of behaviour.' The Motor group kicked off the event by throwing a barbecue for staff and clients in which the proceeds were donated to the charity. 'I think once they started to do it everyone was egging each other on and they seemed to enjoy it actually, I'm a bit worried,' Mr Reeve jested. Funds raised during the Polished Man campaign will contribute to preventative measures to address violence against children . He added: 'I was serving on the front counter and I've only got one nail done and someone noticed and said ""did you bruise it?"" ' I tell them the reason why and they get involved. It becomes a focus and talking point for people and it has certainly boosted the awareness around people so far because they've asked a lot of questions.'

"Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and his wife have been indicted on federal corruption charges for illegally accepting luxury clothes, free vacations, large loans and private plane rifes from a wealthy Richmond businessman who allegedly expected political favors in return. Authorities alleged that McDonnell and his wife received gifts from Jonnie R. Williams a former chief executive of Star Scientific Inc, a dietary supplement maker. McDonnell has not been charged with any crime. The indictment alleges that the McDonnells worked together to bestow the prestige of the governors office to Williams' firm - which was a former cigarette manufacturer. The 14-count indictment against McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, includes one count of conspiracy to commit honest-services wire fraud; three counts of honest-services wire fraud; one count of conspiracy to obtain property under color of official right; six counts of obtaining property under color of official right; and one count of making false statements to a federal credit union. Bob McDonnell is also charged with an additional count of making a false statement to a financial institution, and Maureen McDonnell is charged with one count of obstruction of an official proceeding. Indicted: Outgoing Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, wait in the old Senate Chambers prior to the inauguration of Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe at the Capitol in Richmond, on Saturday, Jan. 11, 2014 . Acting Assistant Attorney General Raman said in a news release. 'Ensuring that elected officials uphold the public's trust is one of our most critical responsibilities.' One term: Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell gestures as he delivers his State of the Commonwealth address before a joint session of the 2014 General Assembly at the Capitol in Richmond, Virginia on Wednesday, January 8, 2014 . 'Today's charges represent the Justice . Department's continued commitment to rooting out public corruption at . all levels of government,' McDonnell left office earlier this month after four years in the governor's office. Virginia law limits governors to a single term. A federal investigation overshadowed the final months in office for the once-rising star of the Republican Party, with authorities looking into gifts he and his family received from a political donor. In July, McDonnell apologized and . said he had returned more than $120,000 in loans and other gifts from . Johnnie Williams, the CEO of pharmaceutical company Star Scientific. He . insisted that he had done nothing illegal on behalf of Star Scientific . but said he'd do 'things differently today than choices I made a couple . of years ago.' On Tuesday, McDonnell repeated that apology but insisted he had done nothing wrong. 'I . deeply regret accepting legal gifts and loans from Mr. Williams, all of . which have been repaid with interest, and I have apologized for my poor . judgment for which I take full responsibility,' McDonnell said. Rain: Outgoing Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell (back R) and his wife Maureen sit behind Huma Abedin, aide to Hillary Clinton and wife of former U.S. congressman Anthony Weiner at the start of the swearing-in ceremony of Terry McAuliffe as Virginia's governor . 'However, . I repeat emphatically that I did nothing illegal for Mr. Williams in . exchange for what I believed was his personal generosity and friendship. The scandal unfolded around the same time as a separate politically embarrassing case involving a former executive mansion chef who was accused of embezzlement and, in turn, accused McDonnell's children of taking mansion food and supplies for personal use. The governor later reimbursed the state. The fallout seeped into the general election, with McDonnell playing a low-key role in support of Republican Ken Cuccinelli, who lost to Democrat Terry McAuliffe. Asked why he hadn't been more visible, McDonnell replied, 'That's a question for the candidate.' McDonnell, 59, is the first governor ever to face criminal charges in Virginia. Gov McDonnell was accused of used the influence of his office to promote Star Scientific's anti-inflammatory supplement, Anatabloc, for Jonnie R. Williams Sr and his company. Bob and Maureen McDonnell, pictured in 2012, married in 1976 and they have five children together, while Jonnie Williams is married to Celeste and they have four children . Virginia First Lady Maureen McDonnell, left, and her daughter Cailin McDonnell react to their tandem parachute jumps with members of the U.S. Army's Golden Knights at the Dinwiddie County Airport Friday, April 29, 2011 . Jeanine McDonnell, daughter of Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, received a $10,000 engagement check from Williams . They contributed more than $100,000 to McDonnell's political organizations and gave the governor's family personal gifts worth thousands of dollars. Some of the 'luxury items' were said to include cosmetic dentistry work for the mother-of-five, as well as jewelry and a $15,000 Bergdorf Goodman shopping spree for Maureen. The governor made a public apology in July and repaid $50,000 in loans as well as another $70,000 loan made to a small business McDonnell set up with his sister. He then returned what he called 'tangible' gifts his family accepted from Williams. According to a person close to the McDonnells and familiar with the PAC's operations, Maureen had complained to the committee she did not have enough funds to keep up the style she believed a first lady should uphold. This May 5, 2011 photo shows McDonnell campaign donor Jonnie Williams left, and Maureen McDonnell during a reception for a  NASCAR race at the Executive Mansion in Richmond . The family were allegedly struggling after their finances were hit by the real estate market and properties they bought totaling $3.84million lost value. Maureen McDonnell was given a PAC credit card after she made the complaint, according to the source. Indeed, in August, McDonnell announced on his hourm long monthly show on Washington's WTOP radio that he is working with his private legal team to return all gifts still in his family's possession to Williams. Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, however, said he won't return Williams' gifts or reimburse him for their reported $18,000 value because they include vacations, dinners and private jet travel - not things that can be given back. There are some bells you can't un-ring. You can't un-take an airplane flight,' Cuccinelli said. '...I didn't get loans, didn't get cash, didn't get shopping sprees.' Maureen McDonnell spent $6,000 around the time of Bob McDonnell's January 2010 inauguration and complained to the PAC the family did not have enough to finance her first lady wardrobe . Asked why he wouldn't reimburse Williams for the gifts' value, he said because, 'No money changed hands.' Cuccinelli, the Republican nominee to succeed McDonnell as governor, disclosed his gifts from Williams on his required statements of economic interest, although he accepted some of them years before they were reported. Cuccinelli amended four years' worth of financial disclosure reports in April, listing a $3,000 family vacation and a $1,500 catered Thanksgiving dinner at Williams' luxury waterfront villa on Virginia's Smith Mountain Lake among items he had earlier overlooked. McDonnell's gifts from Williams, however, came to light through weeks of news reports, not his own economic interest filings. His gifts were more numerous and more tangible, including a $6,500 Rolex watch inscribed to the '71st governor of Virginia,' the check for 28-year-old daughter Cailin, and a $10,000 engagement check for daughter Jeanine, 32, before her May wedding. Both wedding gifts have already been returned, McDonnell said. Spokesman for the governor and first lady Rich Galen told the Washington Post in July that Maureen McDonnell was borrowing the expensive clothes and they would be donated to charity once her husband's term is complete . 'I am working with my counsel to return gifts that have been given,' McDonnell said. 'My eldest daughter returned her engagement gift and my daughter Cailin has returned her wedding gift, and there are other substantial items that are in the process of being returned, and I'll let you know more when I do.' In July, McDonnell said he had repaid nearly $125,000 in personal and business loans that Williams made, and the governor, through his private legal and public relations team, issued an apology to Virginians. The governor did not disclose either the loan from Williams or gifts from him which candidates and public officeholders are required to file annually broadly sketching out their personal finances. McDonnell, entering the final five months of the single, non-renewable term to which Virginia uniquely limits its governors, defended his decision not to report the gifts, noting that the state's ethics laws compel disclosure only of gifts given directly to officeholders or candidates themselves, not to their immediate families. Iconic:The governor's career began to unfold when a tip to a fraud hotline alleged the head chef at the governor's mansion was stealing food . The McDonnells, both 59 years old, believe they have done nothing illegal and plan to fight the charges in court, they said in separate statements through their lawyers. McDonnell, a Republican, said in July he had repaid $120,000 in loans from Jonnie Williams, a major campaign donor and the founder of Star Scientific. He also apologized for the embarrassment the gifts and loans to him and his family had caused Virginia. Williams resigned as Star Scientific chief executive in December. McDonnell had acknowledged that he and his family received more than $160,000 in gifts and loans from Williams. The gifts from Williams ranged from a $6,500 Rolex watch for McDonnell, to wedding and engagement presents and money for his daughters, and a $15,000 shopping spree for first lady Maureen McDonnell. A spokeswoman for Star Scientific did not immediately return a call requesting comment.","Former Virginia governor Robert McDonnell and his wife were indicted on Tuesday by a federal grand jury and charged with accepting bribes .

"Online check-in has made it easier to reserve your place on a fight, but it can’t stop the dreaded bag drop queues when you arrive at the airport. In a bid to solve this, Air France and KLM have created a digital tag, and tracking device that not only let you bypass this airport chore, but could also spell the end of lost luggage. Both devices are linked to the airlines' Flying Blue accounts and flight information is automatically updated before every journey. Air France and KLM created the eTag, pictured, to reduce the queues at airport bag drops. The tag is linked to a customer account and details are automatically updated before every journey. The scheme will launch by the end of the year, but prices have not been announced . In October, British Airways began customer-trials of new re-useable digital bag-tags - similar to those unveiled by Air France and KLM. The electronic bag-tag is used by passengers who have their booking details sent to a smartphone using the British Airways app. Under the scheme, passengers use their smartphone to check in, choose their seat and obtain their mobile boarding pass. The app then automatically updates the digital bag-tag with a unique barcode, containing flight details. The system consists of the eTag and eTrack. The eTag is fixed to suitcases and means travellers can drop off their luggage without having to re-label it each time they fly. While the eTrack traces luggage around the world, in case it’s lost, left behind or stolen via a smartphone. Once the devices are connected to a Flying Blue account, flight details are updated when a new booking is made, and the tag is activated shortly before each journey. The eTrack is then placed inside the luggage and can be traced online, while the tag is securely fixed to a handle using padlock codes. The eTag, pictured left, can also be used with the eTrack, pictured right. The eTrack traces luggage around the world, in case it's lost, left behind or stolen. It is placed inside luggage and can be traced using a smartphone or on the web . Following the official launch, the devices will be sold together, or separately, and there is a Samsonite case which features both devices as standard . The companies are aiming to go live with the first customer groups at the end of 2014. Air France and KLM’s plans were detailed on a YouTube video, but the companies have not officially announced the scheme. MailOnline has contacted the firms to ask about the security of the tags, what measures are in place to prevent hack attempts, and what happens if the luggage is overweight. It is thought the airlines will set up a designated bag drop off point for its eTag customers so they can avoid the queues. It will also be launching a range of colours for the tag, to match different bags. Following the official launch, the devices will be sold together, or separately, and there is a Samsonite case which features both devices as standard. Price details have not been revealed.","Air France and KLM have created a digital tag, and tracking device .

"Posh students at Scotland's top . university have posted a controversial video of themselves online pouring hundreds of pounds worth . of champagne over their heads. The YouTube footage shows a group of well-dressed young . men from St Andrews University decadently drenching themselves in £25 bottles of Moet Chandon. In total, 25 bottles of bubbly can be counted, including a massive magnum - which would cost more than £700 at the tills. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Controversial: Posh students at Scotland's top university have posted a video of themselves pouring hundreds of pounds worth of champagne over their heads. In this picture a student pours Moet over his head . Lavish: The YouTube footage shows a group of well-dressed young men from St Andrews University decadently drenching themselves in £25 bottles of Moet Chandon . Joke: Bottles of Moet are poured over the heads of these students on The West Sands in St Andrews in a scene mimicking Chariots of Fire . For the majority of hard-pressed students, £700 would cover at least two month's rent. The university - where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met as students - was last month slammed for admitting a just tiny percentage of young people from impoverished backgrounds. Set to a soundtrack which features music from US rapper Kanye West, who often boasts about his wealth, the video begins with a male student entering his local Tesco supermarket and walking past the milk aisle - a nod to the recent 'Milking' craze at Edinburgh University, in which undergrads covered themselves in pints of the white stuff. The curly-haired St Andrews student then stops beside bottles of vintage port - which costs around £7 - but shakes his head in an apparent boast that he can afford better. He is seen picking up the pricey bottle of Moet before promptly emptying it over himself outside the shop in front of crowds of people. The remainder of the three minute 39 second video - which was taken down from YouTube early this evening - features a number of similarly daft clips of the young men wasting the pricey fizz. Getting ready: A group of students are pictured gathering with their bottles of champagne on St Andrews Pier . Soaking: The group then take their robes off and douse themselves in the champagne . Jump: The group them leap off the pier with the bottles in their hands . Locations used include the Swilken Bridge on the town's famous Old Course, outside the university library, on the steps of the student union, outside University Hall, in the famous St Salvator's Quad, on the pier in their famous tomato-coloured gowns which they then remove and jump, and in the busy High Street. One young man is even filmed pouring a £80 magnum of champagne over his naked body in a bubble bath. Seven of the lads recreate the renowned scene from film Chariots of Fire on St Andrews' West Sands - running along the shore pouring champers over their heads to the film's Academy Award-winning original soundtrack composed by Vangelis. Expensive: In total, 25 bottles of bubbly can be counted, including a massive magnum - which would cost in excess of £700 at the tills . Silly: This student douses himself in champagne in the famous St Salvator's Quad . Landmark: This student stands on the famous Swilken Bridge on The Old Course at St Andrews . It's not known whether the magnum was a full new bottle at the start of the prank, but the standard-sized bottles are clearly genuine. St Andrews University - which has Scotland's toughest entry requirements - was criticised earlier this year after admitting just 14 students from the 20 most deprived areas in Scotland in 2011.Many of its students come from Britain's top public schools. But in sharp retort last month, the university said that it expected 'to face a considerable and continuing challenge to widen access, because so few young people from Scotland's most deprived areas are achieving basic university entry grades'.

"Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff is to offer Lewis Hamilton a new contract at the end of the year in a bid to keep him at the team beyond 2015. Hamilton's current three-year deal expires after next season, with recent speculation suggesting Fernando Alonso is attempting to engineer his way into Mercedes as a replacement. Wolff, though, has made it clear he has no intention of looking at any driver other than Hamilton as partner to Nico Rosberg for 2016 and beyond. Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff (right) wants to retain Lewis Hamilton on a long-term deal . Wolff's remarks come in the wake of Mercedes clinching the first constructors' title in their illustrious history with a ninth one-two of the season in Sunday's Russian Grand Prix. All that remains now is for either Hamilton or Rosberg to wrap up the drivers' crown, with the former 17 points clear following a ninth win of the campaign. Addressing the future, and the possibility of recruiting Alonso, Wolff said: 'We have a contract with both our drivers for 2015, and we want to continue with the current line-up. Hamilton currently leads his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg (left) by 17 points in the F1 standings . 'That is because these two boys are part of the success of the team, they know each other so well and they respect each other. 'The moment you get somebody else in that fight could be detrimental to the team's performance. 'So our main priority is to continue with Lewis and Nico beyond 2015.' Out of respect to Hamilton, Wolff has insisted talks that tentatively began earlier this year will not resume again until the championship battle is resolved, almost certain to be in Abu Dhabi on November 23. 'We have agreed with Lewis we want to concentrate on the championship and leave him alone,' added Wolff. 'We want to give him the same possibilities as Nico, and for him not to get involved in commercial, financial and legal discussions until after Abu Dhabi. 'My commitment to him as well is we're not going to talk to anybody about any terms or contracts until then.' Hamilton on his way to another victory at the Russian Grand Prix last Sunday . Wolff has dismissed suggestions of any pressure being applied from the board of parent company Daimler and head man Dieter Zetsche to resolve matters. 'One of the reasons why this team has progressed forward is that as Mercedes-Benz we have this huge mothership in the background helping us,' explained Wolff. 'But also they leave us to do our business and take the decisions we believe are the right ones for this tiny entity (the team). 'We can ask for their opinions when we think it is important, and of course Dieter Zetsche and the board are part of big decision making, but there has been no such pressure.'","Hamilton's three-year deal expires after next season .

"Diplomats, intelligence agents and the military missed obvious warning signs that could have enabled them to prevent the deadly attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, say senators. A bi-partisan report for the first time points the finger at Ambassador Chris Stevens, who was killed in the attack, for refusing offers to reinstate soldiers at the mission in the weeks before the raid. It also criticises the military for failing to respond more quickly on the night of the attack on September 11, 2012. 'Preventable': A Libyan man investigates the inside of the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, two days after the attack that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens . On the 11th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks in New York, armed militants stormed the diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, setting the building on fire. Ambassador Stevens, computer specialist Sean Smith, and CIA security contractors Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, both former Navy SEALs, were killed over the course of two battles that night. Mr Stevens died of smoke inhalation after he was taken to a 'safe room' in the besieged compound. Confusion in the immediate aftermatch as to the sequence of events leading up to the attack turned the issue into a political hot potato that has continued to dog the Obama administration. Officials first wrongly described the assault as a spontaneous mob protest of an anti-Islamic, American-made video. Such a protest did occur at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo earlier that day. Republican critics say the administration was reluctant to deal publicly with a terror attack weeks before the presidential election. On that issue, the report dives into the contentious initial talking points issued by the intelligence community, which helped fuel Republican allegations of an Obama administration cover-up of militant links to the violence. 'Intelligence analysts inaccurately referred to the presence of a protest at the U.S. mission facility before the attack based on open source information and limited intelligence, but without sufficient intelligence or eyewitness statements to corroborate that assertion,' the report said. An armed man waves his rifle at the mission on the night of the raid: Diplomats, intelligence agents and the military missed obvious warning signs that could have enabled them to prevent the deadly attack, say senators . Carnage: Ambassador Stevens, computer specialist Sean Smith, and CIA security contractors Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, both former Navy SEALs, were killed over the course of two battles that night . The senators also take the administration to task for failing to bring the attackers to justice more than a year later. They say the U.S. has identified several individuals responsible but can't capture them because of limited intelligence capabilities in the region and limited cooperation by local governments. Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, said she hoped the report would put to rest conspiracy theories about the attacks. Republican Vice Chairman Saxby Chambliss said the report showed that despite a deteriorating security situation in Benghazi, the U.S. government did not do enough to prevent the attacks or to protect the diplomatic facility. And Republican committee member Susan Collins of Maine called on the administration to punish those responsible. 'A broken system overseen by senior leadership contributed to the vulnerability of U.S. diplomats ... in one of the most dangerous cities in the world,' she said in the report. 'And yet the secretary of state has not held anyone responsible for the system's failings.' U.S. intelligence ultimately blamed the violence on militants who overran the temporary U.S. mission and, hours later, fired mortars at the nearby CIA annex where the Americans had taken shelter. The report says the subsequent investigation showed individuals from many militant groups took part in the 'opportunistic' attacks, including al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, the Libyan militia group Ansar al-Sharia, and members of the Yemeni-based al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. The report does not name Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time and now is a potential 2016 presidential candidate. The State Department said the report largely reaffirms the findings reached a year ago by the Benghazi Accountability Review Board, headed by a former ambassador and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Deputy spokesman Marie Harf noted that the Senate report recommended improvements to security that the State Department has already taken, including upgrading security cameras, improving fire equipment and increasing the presence of Marine security guards. Fire: U.S. intelligence ultimately blamed the violence on militants who overran the temporary U.S. mission and, hours later, fired mortars at the nearby CIA annex where the Americans had taken shelter . Failures: The report also for the first time points the finger at Ambassador Chris Stevens, who was killed in the attack, for refusing offers to reinstate soldiers at the mission in the weeks before the raid . The Senate report notes that the State Department has also created a new assistant secretary position for high-threat posts, but it says the department still needs institutional change to help it react more quickly to security threats. It says State should not rely on local security alone in countries where the host government cannot provide adequate protection and should avoid using diplomatic facilities it knows are inadequately protected. The report says that the department in 2012 had ignored its own 'tripwires' set to determine when it had become too dangerous to operate in Benghazi, and continued to operate the facility there despite a growing number of U.S. intelligence reports showing the danger was rising. 'The security situation in Benghazi is ""trending negatively"" and ... this daily pattern of violence would be the new normal for the foreseeable future,' the head State Department officer in Benghazi was quoted as saying weeks before the attack. While the nearby CIA annex upgraded its security, the temporary mission did not, the report said. It said Ambassador Stevens acknowledged the need for more security yet also turned down available U.S. military resources. The report said the Defense Department had provided a Site Security Team in Tripoli, made up of 16 special operations personnel. But the State Department decided not to extend the team's mission in August 2012, one month before the attack. In the weeks that followed, General Carter Ham, then the head of the military's Africa Command, twice asked Mr Stevens to employ the team, and twice the ambassador declined, the report said. Ambassador Stevens had tried to arrange a local Libyan security force to replace the Americans, but the report said the force was never formed because of bureaucratic delays. Closure: Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, said she hoped the report would put to rest conspiracy theories about the attacks . Still, the report faults the U.S. military for failing to anticipate it might be called on. It also says there was confusion within the Pentagon as to the location of the CIA annex — and says the regional U.S. commander must know where such facilities are in the future. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the committee report 'largely reaffirms' earlier findings and that the security recommendations are consistent with steps the State Department has already taken. 'This reinforces what other investigations have found, which is that there was not enough security to protect the four Americans who lost their lives,' said Mr Carney.","Diplomats and agents missed obvious warning signs, says Senate report ."

Cityscape: Leipzig's skyline, which includes here the New City Hall and the Federal Court, dazzles at dusk . Leipzig is intriguing and beguiling. It buzzes with a youthful vibrancy similar to Berlin’s. It has history and culture in spades, plus fabulous food and drink. All that’s missing are the crowds. Leipzig Central Station sets the tone, with its jaw-dropping grandeur. It’s a station made for travel, and you feel like Marco Polo, simply arriving. The vast arched roof, with its ribcage of girders and massive arches overwhelms, and I stand in awe. ‘It’s good, yes?’ says a local — an understatement. Resplendent: Leipzig's Central Station is the largest in Europe, and has two grand entrance halls . The cultural credentials stack up thick and fast. J. S. Bach is buried in the church of St Thomas, where he was choirmaster. If you visit when the organist is practising, the music ascends to the ribbed neo-gothic ceiling. And there is a pristine Bach museum opposite, with original scores and other paraphernalia. A macabre touch is added by the belt clasp and thimble taken from the graves of Bach and his wife. Culture: St Thomas Church where Bach conducted (left) and the Monument to the 1813 Battle of Leipzig (right) Leipzig claims another cultural giant, too. The writer Goethe studied here in the 18th century and mentions the Auerbachs Keller, Leipzig’s second oldest restaurant (it dates back to the 15th century) as the first place Faust is taken to by Mephistopheles. I usually loathe ‘historic’ restaurants, but this felt genuine - and the robust Saxony cuisine (venison in cream sauce) was the real thing. Unlike nearby Dresden, Leipzig lost only a quarter of its buildings in World War II, so the old city retains a strong sense of the past. Trams clank on the edge of the old quarter; the smell of bratwurst tantalises from stalls, while the buildings are a delightful mix of 18th century romanticism, art nouveau and Twenties modernist. A very pretty city: The Market Square in Leipzig offers plenty of places for visitors to eat or try the local brew . A plaque on the side of a department store once owned by a Jewish family — and ransacked during Kristallnacht in 1938 — offers a sombre reminder of the city’s past. The darker side of Leipzig’s history continues at the Völkerschlachtdenkmal — a monument built on the site of 1813’s Battle of Leipzig. Looming over a busy crossroads to the southeast of the city, it is a towering granite-faced edifice that was completed in 1913, and constructed on the site of the bloodiest fighting between Napoleon’s army and an alliance of Russians, Austrians, Prussians, Swedes and Saxons. Enter the monument through a massive figure carved into the base and ascend to the mausoleum. It feels like something out of Lord Of The Rings. Gigantic grim-faced stone knights stand, their heads bowed, in a circle. It’s a testament to the folly of war, though some might see it as a Teutonic celebration of force. Take a lift to the viewing platform for sweeping views of surrounding countryside. For more recent history, the Memorial Museum in the Round Corner is startling. Based at the former Stasi headquarters where the bureaucracy of communist repression was carried out, you can view the secret police’s tools - cameras, bugging equipment, uniforms, informer lists. Chilling. Modern outlook: Leipzig's contemporary-looking Museum of Fine Arts, which was built in 2004 . Yet this is not a city pickled in its past. The Museum of Fine Arts was built in 2004, and features a light installation inside its entrance, shaped like a spark plug. A nearby building features Michael Fischer’s comic book-like representations of a mass demonstration in the city, in the late Eighties. These sparked similar protests which led to the fall of the communist regime. Beer and bars feature heavily in Leipzig, of course. Sure, you can drink the classic golden lagers of the area. However, you can also try Leipziger Gose, one of the rarest beer styles in Europe, a sour wheat beer only produced in and around the city. Not for the faint-hearted, it has salt and coriander in the brew but is refreshing and moreish in the glass. I enjoyed it with a plate of traditional pork knuckle and dumplings at the Bayerischer Bahnhof brewpub (you eat well in Leipzig). Beer on tap: The streets of Leipzig are awash with plenty of enticing bars and restaurants . If beer’s not your game, the city also majors in coffee (Zum Arabische Coffe Baum is one of the oldest surviving coffee houses in Europe, dating back several centuries). Here I sip an excellent espresso and talk with Gitta Perle, who moved to Leipzig from Dresden. ‘Leipzig is very much a young city,’ she says. ‘Part of the university is in the city centre, people live in the centre, all this keeps it alive. Dresden is more traditional.’ She pauses. I wonder if she is trying to translate the German for stuffy. No one could accuse Leipzig of that. The Furstenhof .

"Britain will have fewer days of 'extreme cold' and will enjoy milder winters as a direct result of climate change, according to a new study. The new research is set to cool growing fears that the Northern Hemisphere could be gripped by more severe winters throughout the next century due to the Arctic warming up. The study, conducted by Dr James Screen, a mathematics research fellow at the University of Exeter, looked at the Arctic amplification phenomenon, which shows a faster rate of warming in the Arctic compared to the South Pole. Extreme cold days and snowy scenes such as this in Epsom, Surrey, could become few and far between due to climate change, according to a new study . This has been linked to a spike in the number of severe cold spells in recent years over Europe and North America. However, Dr Screen examined detailed climate records to show that autumn and winter temperatures have been consistent because northerly winds and the cold days that come with them are warming more rapidly than southerly winds and the resulting warm days. He explained: 'Autumn and winter days are becoming warmer on average, and less variable from day-to-day. 'Cold days tend to occur when the wind is blowing from the north, bringing Arctic air south into the mid-latitudes. Winter 2014 saw above average temperatures but record amounts of rainfall and heavy winds, which resulted in coastal flooding such as here in Saltcoats in Scotland . 'Because the Arctic air is warming so rapidly these cold days are now less cold than they were in the past.' The new study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, also showed that the changes in climate will continue into the future, with projected future decreases in temperature variability in all seasons, except summer. The research was financially supported by the UK Natural Environment Research Council. Persistent heavy rainfall made it the wettest winter on record in most parts of the UK . According to the Met Office, temperatures in winter earlier this year were well above the long-term average with a mean winter temperature of 5.2 degrees with a notable absence of frosts. However, they add that winter 2014 was an exceptionally stormy season, with at least 12 major winter storms affecting the UK in two separate spells. Persistent heavy rainfall also made it the wettest winter on record in England, Scotland and Wales and the second wettest in Northern Ireland. There was major flooding in the Somerset Levels, which left homes, farms, roads and businesses submerged in several feet of floodwater for almost a month.","Research shows that northerly winds are warming meaning less cold days .

"South African paralympian Oscar Pistorius is reportedly negotiating with the parents of Reeva Steenkamp – the girlfriend he is charged with killing – in an effort to avoid an expensive civil lawsuit. Barry and June Steenkamp are believed to be considering a civil action against Pistorius, 27, for emotional distress and loss of earnings, which experts predict could cost the athlete between £110,000 and £165,000 before the end of his criminal trial. Pistorius denies deliberately killing the 29-year-old model at his home in Pretoria on Valentine’s Day last year, instead claiming he shot through a bathroom door after mistaking her for an intruder. Olympic sprinter Oscar Pistorius is reportedly negotiating with the parents of Reeva Steenkamp - the girlfriend he is accused of killing - in order to avoid a civil lawsuit . June Steenkamp and Barry Steenkamp have declined to speak about any potential lawsuit, but it believed they are considering taking action for emotional distress and loss or earnings . The Steenkamp family have declined to speak about any potential civil action against Pistorius, calling it a private matter. South African media reports suggest Barry and June Steenkamp were being helped financially by their daughter and have since had to rely on payment for foreign media interviews to help with the costs of running a pub in Port Elizabeth. Now the couple are reportedly considering the civil action against Pistorius to recoup some of the money they feel they have missed out on since their daughter’s untimely death. They are also said to be considering seeking damages for emotional distress. Pistorius insists he had no intention of killing Ms Steenkamp when he shot through a bathroom door in the middle of the night almost a year ago. Happier times: Oscar Pistorius pictured with his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in Johannesburg in 2012 . He maintains he had mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder, while prosecutors argue Ms Steenkamp’s death was a case of premeditated murder. The murder trial is set to begin on March 2, with Pistorius facing a minimum of 25 years in prison if convicted. According to Barry Bateman, a journalist for South Africa’s Eyewitness News who is also writing a book about the case, the prosecution are planning to argue that Pistorius has long-term problems with anger management. Mr Bateman told ABC News: ‘What the state is now going to do, they want to show that he’s a violent person... that he's a gun-toting hot head’. Scene: The home of Olympic amputee sprint star Oscar Pistorius in Pretoria after the shooting . The athlete, who during his career who known as ‘Blade Runner’ due to the prosthetic legs he uses to run after becoming a double amputee at the age of 11, has hired an all-star legal team to defend him at the trial. Among them are a number of US-based forensic and ballistic experts who will attempt to prove Pistorius did not intend to kill Ms Steenkamp. Last week it was revealed that a female judge, Thokozile Masipa, has been appointed to preside over the trial.","Barry and June Steenkamp may launch a civil action against paralympian .

"It was a mad dash to scrub the red carpet ahead of Sunday's Golden Globes after a pipe burst, spewing liquid some say smelled of sewage across the pathway for the stars. Black water gushed onto horrified members of the international press awaiting the arrival of Hollywood glitziest stars dressed in their finest gala attire. The press fled from the spill as the Beverly Hills Fire Department rushed to the scene to clean up the smelly mess in front of Hollywood's famous Beverly Hilton Hotel. Scroll down for video... Disgusting: Members of the press awaiting the arrival of Hollywood's biggest stars weer horrified ahead of Sunday's Golden Globes when a sewage pipe burst, spewing stinking black water across the once gleaming red carpet . Black rain: The reportedly stinking black water poured onto press as they awaited Hollywood's greatest luminaries to parade down the Golden Globes red carpet--the sprinkler system had evidently been set off by an overheated lighting rig . Watery reception: Press members were asked to move away as the black 'smelly' liquid rained on their awards day parade . An E! Television red carpet correspondent was among the disgusted press members who witnessed the unprecedented sullying of one of the world's most anticipated celebrity events. 'A pipe has appeared to totally bust and there is water gushing, literally everywhere in the position of where all of the international press – everyone has moved out of the way,' said Catt Sadler. 'Rain was not expected in LA today, but we've got a little flooding!' The flooding was apparently more like a malodorous deluge. 'Sewage pipe break on red carpet at #GoldenGlobes so it’s not hot as s**t but it could smell like it today. Good times,' tweeted Access Hollywood's Billy Bush just after the disaster. Fire hazard: Precious light and sound equipment was drenched in the suspicious liquid as it sprayed down from above just hours before one of the biggest event of he entertainment awards season . Why the smell? Initial reports suggests an overheated lighting rig triggered fire sprinklers, but it remains unclear why the water smelled of sewage . Unsavory walk of fame: For a time, it appeared the cavalcade of Jimmy Choos and Manolo Blahniks might ending up creating a stinkier version of the footprint covered Hollywood Walk of Fame on their march into the hotel's historic International Ballroom . #HollywoodProblems: Frantic crews first thought they'd rip up the carpet but eventually a less extreme situation was found . Doing important work: Beverly Hills fire department were at the scene in 15 minutes to ensure the Tinsel Town luminaries remained unaffected by the fetid mess left by an inadvertently set off fire sprinkler .

'Could be bad for long gowns,' wrote the professional emcee, along with a picture of the fire fighters cleaning up the mess. Where glamor begins: The Golden Globes are one of the most eagerly anticipated events of the entertainment awards season. While this year's got off to a smell start, crews quickly resolved' this public relations nightmare . According to KABC, the gusher began when a lighting rig overheated, setting off a sprinkler, which rained the fluid down onto the crimson walkway. But eye witnesses said the water smelled of sewage, suggesting there was more to the story than simply a fire system set off by accident. 'We can confirm that there was a malfunction with a sprinkler near the red carpet,' read a statement from the posh Beverly Hilton Hotel, where the Golden Globes have been held--sewage free--for over 50 years. 'The situation was quickly resolved. Despite the incident the red carpet will open at its regularly scheduled time, the statement continued. ' As some of the biggest names in entertainment are scheduled to attend Golden Globe Awards tonight, we wanted to give the carpet one last wash before it opened.'","A pipe burst and spewed water all over the Golden Globes red carpet as press awaited the arrival of Golden Globes attendees Sunday .

"More than 90 percnet of Egyptians backed the country's new constitution in a referendum, state media reported on today. The expected victory nudges army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ever closer to a bid for the presidency. The vote advances a transition plan the army unveiled after deposing Islamist president Mohamed Mursi last July. Egypt's new constitution was overwhelmingly approved in a referendum, state media reported on today, an expected victory that nudges army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ever closer to a bid for the presidency . Polling station officials count ballots in the Egyptian capital Cairo at the end of the second day of voting in a referendum on a new constitution . Egyptians flash the sign of victory as they queue up at a polling station during the second day of voting on a new constitution in Cairo's southern Giza district . The next step is expected to be a presidential election for which Sisi, 59, appears the only serious candidate. Al-Ahram, the state's flagship newspaper, said the constitution was approved by an 'unprecedented majority', citing early results. The constitution won wide support among the many Egyptians who backed the army's removal of Mursi.

An Egyptian army officer (left) and a polling official hold a piece of chocolate with paper wrap featuring Egypt's Defense Minister Abdel Fattah Sissi, during the second day of the vote . There was little trace of a 'no' campaign as the state pressed a crackdown on dissent. Mursi's . Muslim Brotherhood had called for a boycott, seeing the vote as part of . a coup that deposed a leader freely elected 18 months ago and revived . an oppressive police state. An Interior Ministry official said turnout appeared to be more than 55 percent. It was the first vote held since Mursi was overthrown following the June 30 mass protests against his rule. A decree is expected within days setting the date for presidential and parliamentary elections, Al-Ahram reported. The official result is expected to be announced on Saturday. The Islamists' opponents pointed to the result as proof of a popular mandate for the removal of Mursi.

Father Antonious shows his inked finger after casting his ballot in a constitutional referendum inside a polling station in Dalga village of Minya . 'The Egyptians write the . Brotherhood's death certificate,' Al-Youm Al-Sabea, a privately owned . newspaper, declared on its front page. The . Brotherhood had called for protests during the voting. Nine people were . killed on the first day of voting in clashes between its supporters and . security forces. The Interior Ministry said 444 people were arrested . during the two-day vote. The . authorities, who have billed the transition plan as a path to . democracy, have also jailed moderate Islamists and secular-minded . activists in recent weeks, including prominent figures in the 2011 . uprising against President Hosni Mubarak. The . referendum has been seen as a public vote of confidence in Sisi, widely . viewed as the most powerful figure in Egypt and the man needed to . restore stability. Sisi . appeared to link a possible presidential bid to the outcome of the . vote, saying on Saturday he would need the support of the nation and the . army to run. The stock market has rallied to three-year highs this week, driven partly by hopes for more stable government. But the country has also seen the bloodiest internal strife in its modern history since Mursi's ouster. Bombings, attacks on security forces and bloody street violence occur regularly. Egyptians began voting on Tuesday in a constitutional referendum, the first ballot since the military overthrew Islamist president Mohamed Mursi . Egyptian women supporting the army hold booklets of Egyptian constitution drafts saying ""Yes"", and dance as they hold pictures of army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi . The voting is likely to spawn a presidential bid by Sisi . The government declared the Brotherhood a terrorist organisation on Dec. 25. The group, outlawed for most of its 85-year life, says it remains committed to peaceful protest. A Sisi presidency would turn back the clock to the days when the post was controlled by military men and could kill off any hope of a political accommodation with the Islamist opposition. 'You could see the re-emergence of a domineering president,' said Nathan Brown, a professor of political science at George Washington University and an expert on Egyptian affairs. The constitution was drafted by a 50-member committee appointed by decree. It deletes controversial Islamist-inspired provisions written into the basic law approved when Mursi was still in office, and strengthens the state bodies that defied him: the army, the police and the judiciary. At many polling stations, the referendum appeared to be a vote on Sisi himself. Women chanted his name and ululated as they stood in line to vote, while a pro-army song popularized after Mursi's overthrow blared from cars. The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies criticised Egyptian media for 'stoking hatred towards the Brotherhood' and contributing to a climate of intimidation. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington warned that international players risked lending legitimacy to a 'flawed and undemocratic progress.' While Western states have criticised the crackdown and called for inclusive politics, they have put little pressure on Cairo. Egypt, which controls the Suez Canal, has been a cornerstone of U.S. policy in the Middle East since the 1970s, when it became the first Arab state to make peace with Israel.","Early results show more than 90 pct voted 'yes'

The 26-year-old netted a sensational 25-yard effort to give his side a 1-0 victory and secure their passage through to the second round. Messi had huffed and puffed for much of the game, often being surrounded by up to three red shirts every time he got near the ball, but his late big of magic was all that mattered in the end. In truth, Carlos Queiroz's side can consider themselves incredibly unlucky to finish the game without a point. VIDEO Scroll down for Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero play football tennis over fence .

Messi had looked calm and relaxed in the tunnel and during his national anthem, giving off the impression of a man who had had the weight of the world lifted off of his shoulders after that sensational goal at the Maracana last Sunday. As if Messi needed another ego boost, Iran captain Javad Nekounam tried to get one over on his team-mates by asking for his shirt during the pre-match handshake! Much like in their opening game, Messi and Argentina really struggled to get going in the first half against Iran.

"He’s the squeaky clean star of Disney’s High School Musical, so Zac Efron’s fans will be shocked to hear how he secretly completed a stint in rehab five months ago. According to TMZ, the 25-year-old actor quietly checked into a treatment facility to deal with a cocaine problem, and a source adds that he also experimented with MDMA - the active ingredient in Ecstasy tablets, which is known as 'Molly' on the street. Zac is now said to be healthy and happy and is focusing on his movie career as he attempts to move on with his life. Scroll down for video . Squeaky clean: Fans of former High School Musical star Zac Efron, pictured at the Toronto Film Festival earlier this month,  will be surprised to hear the actor completed a rehab stint five months ago . Keeping his head down: Zac pictured in April - at around the same time he is believed to have entered rehab for the second time . A source told E! News: ‘He's healthy, happy and not drinking. He's taking time to focus on working.’ An insider also told People: ‘He’s doing great. He's taking care of himself and it shows.’ However, it has been reported that prior to entering rehab, Zac's addiction had been causing issues in his movie career. According to TMZ, Zac allegedly missed several days of filming while shooting Seth Rogen's new fraternity comedy Neighbors back in April. A film source told the site: 'It was common knowledge he was struggling with cocaine.' TMZ also claimed that Zac and a group of friends caused around $50,000 of damage in their room at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas during a cocaine-fulled party. While Zac hasn’t commented on the rehab . reports, he told reporters at the Toronto International Film Festival . recently: 'I'm good, real good.' The news of the stint in the treatment facility will come as a shock to Zac’s fans as the actor has mainly stayed away from the party scene, apart from one well publicised visit to a strip club back in 2010. While Zac admitted that he went to Flash Dancers Gentlemen's Club in New York with High School Musical co-star Corbin Bleu, he insisted he had received permission from his then-girlfriend Vanessa Hudgens before the boys’ night out. ‘The hardest part is calling your girlfriend before,' he said on US late-night chat show Jimmy Kimmel Live! 'It's like, how do you even start that conversation without feeling like an a**hole?' When Kimmel asked how Vanessa responded, Zac hesitated for a while before saying: 'She was fine with it.' He went on to say that it wasn't exactly what he expected, telling the host: 'I had this image of what it'd be like. Clean cut: Zac shot to fame in Disney's High School Musical franchise . 'Healthy, happy and not drinking': Sources say Zac is concentrating on his career after rehab . 'I've heard a lot about these places, mostly from rap music - they're supposed to be pretty reputable!' He added: 'So I envisioned myself in a . nice couch with stunner shades with T-Pain and Usher making it rain . money! And it just wasn't like that.' Otherwise, Zac has maintained a low profile and is not usually spotted out partying like his young Hollywood contemporaries. Zac will next appear on the big screen in Parkland, about the days surrounding President Kennedy's death in Dallas in 1963. Relapse: Zac Efron is said to sought help for his cocaine addiction a second time after suffering a relapse while shooting new comedy Neighbors back in April . Efron plays Jim Carrico, the real-life doctor who battled to save JFK at Parkland Memorial Hospital after he was shot. He also recently shot Are We Officially Dating? alongside Imogen Poots, and Neighbors with Dave Franco. MailOnline has contacted Efron's representatives for comment.","Actor, 25, secretly checked into a treatment facility five months ago .

"Cem Duzgan, 21, was shot 11 times as he played a game of pool with his friends at the Clapton FC Club in Hackney, east London on October 5 2009 . Four men who shot an innocent victim 11 times with a sub-machine gun in a botched revenge killing have been jailed for a total of 114 years. Cem Duzgan, 21, was shot in the head, body, arms and legs as he played a game of pool with his friends at Clapton Football Club in Hackney, east London, on October 5 2009. The victim, who lived with his family in Islington and worked as a sales assistant at a clothes store in Croydon, died at the scene, Scotland Yard said. The court heard the murder was part of a spate of violent tit-for-tat incidents - including other killings - that took place around that time between the Tottenham Turks and the Hackney Turks gangs. Just three days before Mr Duzgan's murder, another man was shot and killed in a targeted attack while driving a car in Tottenham. The prosecution case was that Mr Duzgan was killed in revenge, though he was not thought to be the intended target. Blaize Lunkula, 28, of no fixed address, who was found guilty of murder on February 27 at the Old Bailey, was sentenced to life imprisonment, to serve a minimum of 35 years. Another three men found guilty the same day were also sentenced. Yusuf Arslan, 24, of no fixed address, was sentenced to life imprisonment, to serve a minimum of 33 years. Ndombasi Makusu, 27, of no fixed address, was sentenced to life imprisonment, to serve a minimum of 28 years. And Christian Barabutu, 22, also of no fixed address, was jailed for a minimum of 18 years. The court heard that the gunman - Lunkula - gained access to the Turkish social club with the help of an accomplice who held open a pair of secure air lock doors. People inside became aware something was happening and Mr Duzgan went to investigate the lobby area. Lunkula opened fire, shooting 11 bullets . through the victim's head, body, arms and legs. Ballistics experts . later estimated the weapon was less than 30cm from Mr Duzgan's head when . it was fired. Blaize Lunkula (top left), Yusuf Arslan (top right), Ndombasi Makusu (bottom left) and Christian Barabutu (bottom right) have been jailed for the murder of innocent victim Cem Duzgan, in an execution-style killing as part of a gang feud, police said . Lunkula had travelled to the scene with Makusu and Barabutu, who had been involved in planning and organising the shooting. Mobile phone analysis found that all the defendants had dumped their phones shortly after the murder and did not use them again. Before the killing they had been in contact with each other frequently. The phone evidence also pinpointed Lunkula, Makusu and Barabutu as being in the area of the club at the time of the shooting. The other defendant Arslan remained away from the scene, having been the earlier 'organiser' and present at a 'council of war' when the revenge attack was planned. Acting Detective Sergeant Simon Franklin, the case officer for the homicide and major crime command, said: ‘The victim was simply enjoying a night out with friends when he went to investigate a disturbance. ‘Sadly this decision cost him his life as he became unwittingly caught up in a bitter and violent rivalry between two gangs operating in the area.’ The Mac 11 machine gun used was not recovered but ballistics experts were able to prove it had been used in two other shootings linked to Hackney Turks premises in 2009.","Cem Duzgan, 21, was shot 11 times with a sub-machine gun in Hackney .

"Giorgio Chiellini scored twice for Italy and netted an own goal for Azerbaijan in a 2-1 win in a European Championship qualifier as the Azzurri remained perfect under new coach Antonio Conte. Azerbaijan defended with 10 men and Italy had trouble creating opportunities until Chiellini took advantage of an error by the goalkeeper to give the Azzurri the lead in the 44th minute. Chiellini then scored into his own net in the 76th minute as he attempted to defend a corner kick but he made up for his error by heading in again eight minutes from the end. Giorgio Chiellini scored three goals, including one in his own net as Italy beat Azerbaijan 2-1 . Italy recorded their second straight victory in Group H to remain tied with Croatia on six points . 'In good and bad I did it all,' said Chiellini. 'But the important thing is we came out on top.' Croatia, who won 1-0 at Bulgaria, share the Group H lead with Italy with six points each. Bulgaria and Norway, who won 3-0 at Malta, are next with three points each while Azerbaijan and Malta trail with zero. In Bulgaria, Nikolay Bodurov scored an own goal for Croatia in the 36th. Norway were helped by two goals from Blackburn forward Joshua King, who also set up the opener from Mats Moller Daehli. Chiellini heads Italy into the lead against Azerbaijan in their qualifier in Palermo . Italy beat Norway in their opening qualifier and was also a winner over the Netherlands in a friendly to open Conte's tenure. The former Juventus manager has still not called up Mario Balotelli, and while Ciro Immobile and Simone Zaza performed well in the opening two matches, they struggled for stretches this time. 'I have little to criticize the lads about,' Conte said. 'Azerbaijan came here not to play but to hope for some fortunate dead ball opportunities.' Italy were in control from the start in Palermo but struggled to deal with the defensive pressure applied to midfield maestro Andrea Pirlo, who made his return to the national team for the first time since the World Cup. Azerbaijan's Rauf Aliyev (right) runs away to celebrate after Chiellini (second right) put through his own net . Chiellini made amends for his error to head Italy back in front against Azerbaijan . At one point, Conte ordered Pirlo to exchange positions with center back Andrea Ranocchia to shed the choking coverage. But Pirlo still appeared frustrated, as evidenced when he drew a yellow card for a sliding tackle on Rauf Aliyev in the 33rd. Italy's best chances early on came from set pieces, such as when Pirlo set up a header for Ranocchia that sailed high in the 37th minute. Azerbaijan didn't produce a single shot until the 40th minute when Rufat Dadasov launched an attempt from 40 yards that flew about 10 yards over the target. Four minutes later, Kamran Agayev ventured out of his goal and attempted to punch away a corner kick but Chiellini - risking a fist to the face - beat him to the ball and headed in to the empty net. Italy celebrate a hard-fought victory in Palermo in their Group H qualifying tie . Italy manager Antonio Conte issues some instructions to his team from the sideline . Zaza nearly scored a spectacular goal in the 47th minute. Attempting a bicycle kick with his back to the goal his effort went just wide. Azerbaijan hardly threatened until a corner kick in the 76th minute. While attempting to defend Rauf Aliyev near the far post, Chiellini instead redirected the ball into his own net. The ball touched goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon last although it appeared to have already crossed the line at that point. Substitute Sebastian Giovinco set up the winner with a cross from the right that Chiellini headed inside the near post from the edge of the box. Giovinco then nearly made it 3-1 with a long shot that hit the crossbar in the added time.","Giorgio Chiellini put Italy into the lead before scoring an own-goal .

"A video showing a cow being dragged behind a truck has caused outrage among animal lovers in Russia. The video, filmed with a car dashboard camera, show the large animal being pulled down a highway outside the port city of Rostov-on-Don in the Rostov region, in the west of Russia. The cow’s owner, a local farmer, has defended the decision to transport the animal behind the truck, claiming it was the only way to save her life. Scroll down for video . Dangerous moove: Animal lovers were outraged after this video of a cow being dragged down a road in Russia was posted online . The true story behind the cow-dragging came to light after police, forced into action by a wave of complaints, tracked down the truck driver and the farmer, Ivan Kladov. Mr Kladov, 66, said he had received a call from a neighbour to say that one of his cows had strayed out of its field and was walking beside the road. By the time he arrived, the animal had been struck by a speeding vehicle, and was lying injured beside the road. ‘The cow probably weighed a ton and it was impossible for me to move her on my own,’ he said. Poor girl: Despite the outrage, the farmer who owns the cow said the transportation was necessary in order to get the injured animal home . The video, filmed with a car dashboard camera show the large animal being pulled down a highway outside the port city of Rostov-on-Don in the Rostov region . ‘I couldn't leave her in the road to go back and get help or get my tractor, so I had the idea of seeing if I could drag her there, and I managed to persuade the driver of a truck to stop and help me out. ‘We managed to drag the cow onto a piece of plywood and he dragged her slowly down the road to my farm, where I managed to get her into the stable using a tractor.’ The user that posted the video said he had thought the animal was dead until he saw it moving its tail and had been shocked at the way it was being treated.","Driver filmed cow being dragged behind truck on dashcam in Russia .

"Pregnant women in the workplace have been told to consider an abortion, belittled and called 'placenta brain' by colleagues, a new report has revealed. The Australian Human Rights Commission's Pregnancy and Return to Work National Review Report, was released on Friday, found that one in two women and one in four men have experienced discrimination during pregnancy, parental leave or upon returning to work. The first national inquiry into pregnancy discrimination in the workforce was conducted 15 years ago however not much progress has been made since then, Sex Discrimination Commissioner Elizabeth Broderick wrote in the recent report. Scroll down for video . A new report has found that Australian women still face workplace discrimination as one mother detailed that a supervisor said her pregnancy was 'inconvenient' and asked if she considered getting an abortion . 'This National Review confirms that the situation has not markedly changed,' Ms Broderick wrote. 'Working while pregnant is still often seen as a privilege, not a right. Not only that, this view extends to parents on return to work. Discrimination continues to be widespread and has a cost - not just to women, working parents and their families - but also to workplaces and the national economy.' The commission report, which surveyed 2000 mothers and 1000 fathers, further found that the nature of discrimination involved pregnant women being perceived as an inconvenience and liability in the workplace. 'When I told my supervisor I was pregnant, the response was ""well, you will need to leave - this is very inconvenient for the organisation - you should have told us that you were planning this - have you considered [an] abortion?"",' one woman said. Other inappropriate comments involved a woman who was belittled by a colleague. 'One of the other men in the office had started calling me ""placenta brain"" when I was pregnant,' she said. Another woman was told she 'was no longer an asset to the business, just a liability'. Women also reported receiving no support from managers about their family obligations. 'It was relayed to me that now that I have a child that I should focus on that more and not be so hungry to be progressive in my career. That by offering me this lower job they were allowing me to be a better mother,' one woman said. Other incidents involved a female manager telling a mother that she had to choose between a family or a senior role in the company as 'it's a myth you can have both'. Almost one in five mothers indicated that they were made redundant, restructured, dismissed or their contract was not renewed either during their pregnancy, when they requested or took parental leave or when they returned to work. One pregnant woman who suffered from morning sickness says she was told that she was spending too much time in the bathroom and not enough on the shop floor. 'Even though he [the boss] knew I had morning sickness, he'd text me while I was vomiting and tell me to get back onto the floor immediately,' the woman said. 'I had bad back and leg pain, but I wasn't allowed to sit down. If I did, he'd click his fingers at me like I was a dog and tell me to stand up.' Nothing was done when the woman made a complaint to Human Resources. Ms Broderick says the review does seek to devalue the role undertaken by parents and carers nor does it aim to push women into paid work. 'What it seeks to do is to ensure that discrimination is no longer the reason that women opt out of the paid workforce,' she said. 'Just as we all have a right to family, we also have a right to paid work. If we work together, we can create workplaces where pregnancy, parental leave and return to work discrimination have no place. 'We can ensure that three years from now, when we release the next prevalence survey, the outlook it captures will be considerably brighter.'","It has been 15 years since the first national inquiry into pregnancy discrimination in the workplace .

"A baby boy, who was abandoned by his Australian adoptive parents, has been relocated to one of Thailand's advanced hospitals which provides advanced medical treatment for Down's Syndrome patients. Gammy will be treated by several specialists at Samitivej Sriracha Hospital in Bangkok, Nine News reported on Sunday. This comes after Pattharamon Janbua - the surrogate mother of the six-month-old boy - carried twins for an Australian couple, but they only took the healthy baby girl home with them. The 21-year-old Thai woman has also vowed to care for the critically-ill baby she gave birth to, and had her hopes of a spirited survival for Gammy heightened in the days since he has been receiving treatment for a serious lung infection. He was previously being treated at a hospital in Chonburi province, southeastern Thailand. Staff at the new hospital said they would take care of Ms Janbua and treat her  like family. Through a translator, Ms Janbua said she is 'very happy that everybody loves the baby (and) everybody wants to help the baby'. Scroll down for video . Pattaramon Chanbua shared a tender moment with her baby boy Gammy at a hospital in Chonburi province, southeastern Thailand on Sunday . Gammy, pictured here with his older brother Game and mother Ms Chanbua, is expected to be moved to a hospital in Bangkok in the coming days . The three of them sit happily huddled together on a hospital bed, Game keeping an eye on his little brother . Scores of Australians have offered to adopt the baby boy born with Down's Syndrome after he was suddenly abandoned by his parents when they discovered his disability. Aided by an incredible fundraising effort for his medical costs, which now stands at more than $182,000, Ms Pattharamon said she wants to 'take care of Gammy' as her own. 'I won't give my baby to anybody,' she told Fairfax Media. In new pictures taken on Sunday, Ms Chanbua can be seen hugging and kissing her baby boy Gammy as she and her older son Game, 7, sit in hospital with him. The family huddle together in a brightly coloured hospital room while Gammy clutches a creme coloured teddy bear wearing what looks to be a white doctor's lab coat. Game sits next to his mother and looks on at his little brother, who was left with his surrogate mother when his Australian adoptive parents are said to have abandoned him, only taking his healthy twin sister. Ms Chanbua's hopes of a spirited survival for the six-month-old comes after she had all but conceded on Friday that he would die because of his illness. Bangkok-based media outlet, the Thai Rath newspaper, reported Ms Janbua believed her son's death was unavoidable. More than $182,000 has been raised so far for Gammy's mother to pay for her sick son's medical expenses . In hospital on Sunday the six-month-old held onto a creme coloured bear, who looked to be wearing a doctor's lab coat . Ms Chanbua previously said she loved the six-month-old boy like he was her own child, and has vowed to care for her son . She has been by his bedside as he battles a lung infection, according to the Thai Rath newspaper. 'I think the baby will not make it because his lung infection is too serious,' she told a Thai Rath reporter. The first two targets were $25,000 and $150,000 and were surpassed on Friday and Saturday. More than 4,431 people have donated in the weeks since the Hope For Gammy page went live and the new target is set at $300,000. The page pleads: '6 month old baby Gammy was born in Bangkok with down syndrome and a congenital heart condition. He was abandoned by his family and is being cared for by a young Thai woman who does not have the funds for his desperately needed medical treatment. 'Please make a donation so that he can have these operations and improve his quality of life. All monies raised will be kept in trust and will only be used for the care and wellbeing of Gammy.' Ms Pattharamon said she 'did not expect' to see such a large donation of money pool in, and it has given her renewed hope after she was reduced to tears on Friday. The woman broke down during an interview with ABC after telling of her pain for baby Gammy . The campaign by charity Hands Across The Water is still ongoing and they have vowed to donate every cent raised to looking after the little boy . The 21-year-old broke down when she spoke about how the baby she was paid to carry was was rejected by his Australian parents. She told of her pain for the child, saying she loved the baby boy like he was her own and her suffering  has motivated her to take care of him. The young mother - who lives 90km south of Bangkok - had been paid a total of about $16,000 by the couple to give birth to the baby but when she gave birth to twins - a boy and a girl - they only took the girl back to Australia. Ms Janbua - who already had two other children aged three and six - told the ABC she felt sorry for baby Gammy. 'This was the adults’ fault. And who is he to endure something like this even though it’s not his fault?' she said. 'Why does he have to be abandoned and the other baby has it easy? Baby boy Gammy has a congenital heart condition and is critically unwell . The surrogate mother, who already had two children of her own, was paid a total of about $16,000 to have the twins - a boy and a girl . The Thai woman - who lives 90km south of Bangkok - has as three-year-old girl and seven-year-old boy of her own . 'I chose to have him, not to hurt him.' Ms Janbua said she treated the six-month-old like he was one of her own children. 'I love him, he was in my tummy for nine months, it’s like my child,' she told the ABC. 'Never think that you’re not my child, that I don’t care for you.' This came after an online campaign set up for Gammy raised more than $50,000 after his heartbreaking story was shared. Baby boy Gammy has a congenital heart condition and is critically unwell. The couple, who have remained anonymous, reportedly told Ms Chanbua to have an abortion when they found out four-months into the pregnancy that one of the babies had Down syndrome. The Australian couple, who have remained anonymous, reportedly told Ms Chanbua to have an abortion . 'I would like to tell Thai women – don't get into this business as a surrogate. Don't just think only for money ... if something goes wrong no one will help us and the baby will be abandoned from society, then we have to take responsibility for that,' Ms Janbua said, The Sydney Morning Herald reported earlier on Friday. The couple paid an extra $1673 when they first realised - three-months into the pregnancy - that Ms Janbua was having twins for them. Ms Chanbua is a Buddhist and thinks abortion is a 'sin'. She originally agreed to become a surrogate mother because of her family's financial problems and the arrangement was set-up through an agency. The Australian man and his ethnic-Asian wife could not conceive a baby themselves. Ms Chabua, from a village in Chon Buri province in southern Thailand, gave birth to Gammy and his twin sister in Bangok hospital. 'Because of the poverty and debts, the money that was offered was a lot for me,' she told the ABC. 'In my mind, with that money, we one could educate my children and two we can repay our debt.' However, when the babies were born the agent took the girl away and delivered her to the Australian couple who Ms Chanbua has never met. Ms Chanbua, 21, agreed to become a surrogate mother because of her family's financial problems . She never received the remaining $2341 that she was owed by the agent and is now struggling to keep her baby alive. One doctor has donated $3,000 to the cause. An administrator for the page wrote: 'Dr Pisit of ALL IVF has made a very generous donation after hearing about the Gammy Story. No ALL IVF Center staff have ever been involved in the Gammy case, but are touched by his situation and wanted to help. Thank you very much.' Gammy's tragic story has caused outrage on Twitter. Richard Long wrote: 'Takes a bit to make me angry but this story does. what greedy, selfish people.' Another user, @ChickkinOz, said 'these people need to be financially responsible for this child and woman for life. Unbelievable, how are they parents.' While @BCmanutddesi called it 'OUTRAGEOUS!! 'This story just makes my blood boil!!,' @parentingfiles said. Australians are not the only people that travel to Thailand for surrogacy reasons. Earlier his year, there were 65 babies stuck in Thailand that were conceived by gay Israeli couples and birthed by surrogate Thai women, the Times of Israel said. The claims were made by the Facebook group 'Help Us Bring the Babies Home'. The babies were allegedly unable to be brought to Israel because the Interior Ministry Gideon Sa'ar has not granted Israeli citizenship to the infants. Commercial surrogacy is banned in Australia and it is illegal for people living in Queensland, NSW and the ACT to undertake commercial surrogacy in Thailand. It's also illegal for Australians to select a baby's sex. Current Australian Medicare policy forbids Medicare rebates for IVF use for surrogacy and to receive surrogacy as a treatment option in Australia the following conditions must be fulfilled: . Many Australians have flocked to Thailand over the years because the rules were far less strict. However, the rules have changed this week. After Thailand’s military government reviewed 12 Thai IVF clinics involved in surrogacy cases they have announced new laws. Surrogacy is now only recognised in Thailand if: .

"Celebrity Chef Mario Batali and his partner Joseph Bastianich have agreed to hand over $5.25 million to employees at Batali's several high-profile Italian restaurants. Man-in-charge Batali who was grilled last year for saying 'The way the bankers have toppled the way that money is distributed, and taken most of it into their own hands is as good as Stalin or Hitler, the evil guys', was charged with skimming dough from his own hardworking staff. Two thirds of the settlement will be shared by 1,100 captains, servers, busboys and various staff at restaurants like Babbo, Bar Jamon, Casa Mono, Esca, Lupa, Otto, and others provided they worked from July 22, 2004 to February 14, 2012, according to court documents. Batali has been accused with taking a percentage of server's tips to pay sommeliers' salaries . Stephanie Capsolas who sued Batali was a former employee at the restaurant, 'Babbo' in Manhattan's West Village . The Plaintiffs argued that Batali's restaurants would take 4-5 per cent of tips from employees in order to pay sommeliers' salaries. Workers also claim they were often forced to work over 40 hours a week without even making minimum wage. The 117 plaintiffs were led by Stephanie Capsolas, a former waitress and Hernan Ricardo Alvarado, a former kitchen runner both employed by Babbo in New York's West Village. They are represented by law firms Outten & Golden LLP and Joseph, Herzfeld, Hester & Kirschenbaum LLP. The Huffington Post reports that Martin Kirschenbaum is deemed the 'scourge of restauranteurs' because of his success rate after placing legal actions against famed restaurants like Batali's. Joseph Bastianich (left), pictured here with Michael Stipe (center), and Batali, allegedly told employees not to go to trail because 'lawyers would gain all the money' When the workers sued two years ago, Bastinaich tried to prevent workers from joining the suit by saying, 'only the lawyers make money on these lawsuits, reported The New York Daily News. Capsolas says she was harrased after filing suit and the word 'rat' was written on her locker at work. Capsolas also claims that she was sexually harassed while working at Babbo. This may be the biggest tip skimming settlement in history, reports The New York Daily News. Previously the Shelly Fireman's Restaurant Group that owns restaurants such as Trattoria Dell'Arte, Cafe Fiorello, Fireman's of Brooklyn, Brooklyn Diner USA, Redeye Grill and Shelly's New York was forced to hand over $3.9 million to employees. The Sparks Steakhouse had to pay $3.1 million and Nobu had to pay $2.5 million to employees shorted of tips. Despite being sued for lots of dough, Batali has other ventures outside of owning restaurants. He's host of a show on ABC called 'The Chew.' Batali whips up a quick cocktail on his ABC television show 'The Chew.'","Two thirds of the 'largest tip' settlement will be shared by 1,100 captains, servers, busboys and various staff at Batali's restaurants .

"Surfers from around the world are flocking to the beaches of Oahu for the chance to ride the once-in-a-decade 'super swell' that has caused huge 50-foot waves to crash down on the shore. According to local weather services, the monster waves which began on Wednesday will continue through today till Friday and are the result of a potent area of low pressure which is passing over Hawaii. At one point the world-famous Mavericks surfing competition was canceled such were the worries about the huge swells, but on Thursday, organizers said the event would go ahead as planned on Friday morning.

Preparations: Alice Lunt (R) tosses a sandbag to a volunteer as high surf hits the north shore near Sunset Beach, Haleiwa, Hawaii on Wednesday as they anticipated the arrival of the mega waves . An intense storm in the north Pacific Ocean with a large area of strong winds has generated the large ocean swell heading for Hawaii, said Chris Jacobson, a forecaster with the National Weather Service. Mike Cantin, the warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Honolulu, characterized the waves as potentially life threatening. 'If this swell pans out we're expecting one wave every 20 seconds. The last time we had these types of conditions was 2004,' Cantin said, adding that the winds would also increase risks for those on shore, by pushing water further over land. 'We're expecting water over roads and infrastructure,' he said. 'Those waves will have the potential to cause problems to homeowners. People need to stay away from these waves. They will be big enough to wash over cliffs.'

Significant coastal inundation and property damage is possible. Road closures are likely and breaking waves may make it impossible to enter or leave harbors.' Local residents placed sandbags outside the fronts of their homes to protect their property. 'We will sandbag our laundry area and the beach key access area where we do have some electronic rooms and stuff on the lower level that we don't want to get damaged, you know, elevator rooms and stuff like that,' said Greg Roe, manager of a residential complex that sits close to the beach, in an interview with Hawaii News Now.","Once-in-a-decade system causes huge waves to smash down on the shore of Oahu, Hawaii ."

In serious fighting today, Syrian rebels besieged a military airport near the border with Iraq, opposition sources said, as rebels in the north of the country said they had shot down a fighter jet. Free Syrian Army rebels have been laying siege to Hamadan airport in the city of Albu Kamal on the country's eastern frontier in Deir al-Zor province for the past three days. Struggling to put down a 17-month-old uprising against his rule, President Bashar al-Assad has been increasingly relying on aircraft to attack the rebels, who are comparatively lightly armed with machine guns and rockets.

Grief stricken parents tried desperately to calm their injured children as the doctors struggled to treat an influx of injured residents . The opposition said the airport, where dozens of soldiers are still holding out, has been used by helicopters to launch bombing runs against rebel strongholds. The rebels stepped up their attacks on air bases last week in an attempt to blunt Assad's air power which he has deployed to try to check rebel advances in urban and rural areas in the last month. 'The airport has effectively fallen after many soldiers defected,' Nawaf al-Bashir, a senior tribal figure from Deir al-Zor who is in contact with rebels, said from Istanbul. Reports of heavy fighting outside the base came as rebels in the north of the country said they had shot down a fighter jet using a heavy machine guns. Opposition fighters in Idlib province in the north-west of the country near Turkey said they had shot down the aircraft yesterday as it was taking off from the Abu Thuhur air base. 'They brought it down as it was taking off from the airport using 14.5 millimetre anti-aircraft machine guns,' said Abu Majad, a spokesman from the rebel Ahrar al-Sham (Free Men of Syria) brigade. It was impossible to verify the rebel statements as foreign media access to Syria is restricted. The rebels say they have shot down several fighter jets and helicopters in recent weeks.

Also today, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan slammed Assad's government. 'The regime has become one of state terrorism,' he said. 'Syria is going through a huge humanitarian saga. Unfortunately, as usual, the international community is merely watching the slaughter, massacre and the elimination of Muslims.' Turkey has become one of the strongest critics of Assad's regime and is host to Syrian opposition groups as well as some 80,000 refugees.","Local residents say the attack was launched by Syrian government forces onto a densely populated area of Aleppo .

South African prosecutors who charged the Olympian with murder have . admitted he may not have had his prosthetic legs on when he fired the . shots that killed his girlfriend, removing the key argument the shooting . was premeditated. Pistorius, who goes on trial on March 3, denies the charge of murder and claims he mistook his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp for an intruder when he fired a number of bullets through his bathroom door, killing her instantly. Steenkamp, a South African model, was 29. But documents obtained by South African television news channel eNCA revealed the state’s own ballistics expert said the 27-year-old was ‘most likely’ on his stumps when he pulled the trigger repeatedly. During an extensive bail hearing, prosecutors argued Pistorius took time to put on his prostheses before firing the shots through the locked bathroom door, indicating he was not panicked by the prospect of an intruder. Prosecutors believe security guards at Pistorius’ gated community called the athlete after the shooting to check if everything was okay, to which he replied he was fine and did not require assistance, eNCA reported. Police also claim a neighbour who lives less than 100 metres away heard shouting on Valentine’s Day, the night of Steenkamp’s death.

We can't do that because it's damaging to our case.’ Known around the world as ‘the Blade Runner’ for competing on two fibre-optic blades and running against able-bodied athletes in the London 2012 Olympic Games, Pistorius has turned his official website into a noticeboard to post updates and messages of support relating to the case. Last week, on the anniversary of Steenkamp’s death, Pistorius posted on his website: ‘No words can adequately capture my feelings about the devastating accident that has caused such heartache for everyone who truly loved - and continues to love Reeva. ‘The pain and sadness – especially for Reeva’s parents, family and friends consumes me with sorrow. ‘The loss of Reeva and the complete trauma of that day, I will carry with me for the rest of my life.’ Pistorius, who had his legs amputated below the knee when he was a young boy, became the first amputee to win an able-bodied world track medal at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics.

"South African media have defied a government warning and splashed pictures of President Jacob Zuma’s lavish private home which was controversially revamped using £12m of taxpayers money. State Security Minister Siyabonga Cwele had on Thursday warned media to stop publishing photographs or footage of Zuma’s rural home, arguing that doing so was in violation of security laws. But newspapers ignored the warning and yesterday splashed on their front pages pictures of Zuma’s . lavishly-refurbished home which comes with a swimming pool, helipad, tuckshop and even a football pitch. Defiant: South African media have defied a government warning and splashed pictures of President Jacob Zuma's private home which was controversially revamped using taxpayers' money . 'No one including those in the media, is . allowed to take images and publicise images even pointing where the . possible security features are,' Mr Cwele said. 'It is not done anywhere. We have not seen the images of the White House showing where the security features are. It is not done in any democracy,' he added . Gain: South African President Jacob Zuma . The Times had on its front page an aerial picture of the thatched-roof compound under the headline 'So, arrest us'. The Star also had a picture of the homestead, but with a red X imposed across it and a caption 'Look away! What ministers don’t want you to see”. The editors’ association said it was 'disappointed and shocked' at Thursday’s order. It vowed to continue publishing the pictures, 'not with the intention to endanger the life of anyone, but to continue our role as watchdogs of public expenditure,' said Adriaan Basson of the South African National Editors’ Forum. 'We believe it is of immense public interest to keep on reporting this grotesque public expenditure of over R200 million [Dh72.4 million] on the private residence of a sitting president,' said Mr Basson. The government’s decision to spend over £12.4 million ($20 million) of taxpayer money to revamp Zuma’s private property has sparked public anger amid an economic crunch in a country where 10 million people live on social grants and many have only tin shacks for their homes. It has spent months fighting to keep secret details of public spending on the enormous private estate - dubbed 'Zumaville' - being built in President Zuma's home region of KwaZulu Natal. However leaks to South African media have already revealed that £12.4 million of public money has so far been poured into the massive upgrade project. There are now at least 20 buildings on estate, including a number of large family homes, a medical clinic, swimming pool, football pitch, secure underground living quarters, tuck shop, helipad and visitors centre. Ariel photographs of the lush site show an entire hamlet of large, modern buildings behind a huge security fence in rolling countryside.

Lavish: There are now at least 20 buildings on estate, including a number of large family homes, a medical clinic, swimming pool, football pitch, secure underground living quarters, tuck shop, helipad and visitors centre . The spending revelations have prompted widespread public anger within South Africa and claims of corruption. Many South Africans are incensed at the prospect that their 70-year-old president - who already has three official state residences - might be using taxpayer's money for private gain. There are also long running concerns about the financial burden placed on the public purse by the polygamous president's four wives and estimated 20 children. Speaking on Thursday morning Minister Cwele cited a law first introduced during the apartheid period to argue that Zuma's private home is a 'National Key Point' which should not be photographed for security reasons. How the other half live: The spending sparked public anger amid an economic crunch in a country where 10 million people live on social grants and many have only tin shacks for their homes . 'This kind of thing [distributing photos of national key points] happens nowhere else in the world - in no other democracy,' Minister Cwele argued. Minister Cwele did not say whether people would be prosecuted for distributing photos of other, better well known National Key Points - such as the country's parliament building, the opening of which is broadcast live on national television every year. Nor did he say whether tourists would be banned from taking pictures of the countries' airports - which are also National Key Points - nor how people are supposed to know what they can and can't take photographs of, as the full list of National Key Points is itself a state secret.","State Security Minister Siyabonga Cwele warned media on Thursday .

Bolton-based Warburtons caused a stir in its home town after asking customers what they called a bread roll in an online poll, but did not include the popular local term - barm . In a straw poll carried out by local newspaper The Bolton News, four out of six shoppers called it a barm, as did most of those in a Facebook survey. The bakery has said all it wanted to do was to ignite a passionate debate with bread lovers from around the country. Tearmh France, corporate communications manager at Warburtons, said: 'Our digital team are from Bolton, as is the bakery itself. 'I've had a chat with them and they said that it isn't a definitive list and if people from Bolton are really passionate about calling it a barm, then go onto our Facebook page and tell us about it. 'We hope we haven't offended anyone from Bolton. It's just a fun poll that we thought would start a nice little debate around the country.' John Carr, at Carrs Pasties, said: 'Back in my day we called them flour cakes, but nowadays the most popular term around Bolton and parts of the North West is barm cake.' The family bakers still has a base in the town - including the digital team who posted the gaffe . The name barm cake arose from the use of barm - the foam formed on the top of beer - to make bread dough rise. A barm cake traditionally had a strong flavour that came from the barm itself. Today, the barm cake - or barm for short - is more likely to be made from commercial yeast.","Bakery causes heated online debate after asking what people call a roll .

"Oscar Pistorius may have beaten his girlfriend with a cricket bat before shooting her, South African police believe. Detectives are reported to have recovered a bloodied bat from the Paralympic champion’s bedroom and to have established that model Reeva Steenkamp’s skull had been ‘crushed’. This and other evidence – a smashed bathroom door, a 9mm pistol, the peculiar pattern of wounds on the body and reports of a row earlier in the evening – is said to have led them to believe the murder case against the sprinter is ‘rock solid’. South African police are investigating whether Oscar Pistorius beat his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp unconscious with a cricket bat before shooting her after a bloodied bat was reportedly found at his home . Miss Steenkamp, 29, was shot four times early on Thursday at Pistorius’s luxury home in a secure housing estate on the outskirts of Pretoria. Police have rubbished speculation that Pistorius – who is known to have kept a pistol by his bed and a machine gun at his bedroom window – may have mistaken his girlfriend of three months for an intruder. Prosecutors have formally charged Pistorius with premeditated murder but the Blade Runner’s family say he firmly denies such a charge. Yesterday it emerged that he called his close friend Justin Divaris shortly after the killing – reportedly before the emergency services were alerted – and told him: ‘There has been a terrible accident, I shot Reeva.’ Mr Divaris rushed to the house, where he said Pistorius repeatedly told him: ‘My baba, I’ve killed my baba. God take me away.’ While no officials would comment publicly on the case, a disturbing – though disputed – picture of what may have happened in Pistorius’s home started to emerge. Neighbours have said they heard shouting coming from the house at around 1.30am. There were some suggestions, quickly denied, that the row may have been about Miss Steenkamp’s friendship with a rugby player. At around 3.20am, four shots rang out – apparently not all at once. The first person Pistorius called was his father Henke, 59. Shock: Pistorius appears in court charged with premeditated murder, but says he killed his girlfriend accidentally after mistaking her for an intruder at his home . When he arrived, he allegedly saw his son carrying his nightie-clad girlfriend down the stairs. She had been shot in the head, hip, . arm and hand. Pistorius – and later paramedics – struggled in vain to . save Miss Steenkamp’s life. Police reportedly found the bloodied . cricket bat in the bedroom. The en-suite bathroom door was riddled with . holes, a pistol holster was found by Pistorius’s bed and a gun cartridge . was on the floor. South Africa’s City Press quoted an . unnamed police source as saying: ‘The suspicion is that the first shot, . in the bedroom, hit her in the hip. She then ran and locked herself in . the toilet. ‘She was doubled over because of the . pain. He fired three more shots. She probably covered her head, which is . why the bullet also went through her hand.’ The source said police are carrying out tests to establish whose blood is on the bat. While one scenario is that Pistorius . attacked Miss Steenkamp with the wooden bat, it has also been claimed . that the model may have used it to defend herself. Rugby star Francois Hougaard's agent said the 'sad ordeal' was nothing to do with him in response to rumours that had circulated about the nature of the Springbok's friendship with Miss Steenkamp . A third possibility is that Pistorius . used it to break down the bathroom door. Those close to Pistorius have . suggested that he may done so in a bid to ‘save’ his dying girlfriend. According to this theory, the athlete . first shot Miss Steenkamp by accident, whereupon she fled to the . bathroom. He then shot at the door lock to try to get in, accidentally . killing her. Pistorius’s father appeared to suggest it is this version that he believes. While he admitted that he had not . talked to his son in detail about what happened, he said he had ‘zero . doubt’ that the sportsman thought Miss Steenkamp was an intruder. A more likely defence from Pistorius is to acknowledge that there was a row but that he did not intend to kill her. Blade Runner: Oscar Pistorius ran in both the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics . Some in South Africa have speculated . about the nature of Miss Steenkamp’s friendship with Springbok rugby . player Francois Hougaard, and whether this played a part in the tragedy. The 24-year-old was keen to distance . himself from such reports at the weekend.

"Fearless villagers in South Africa have been filmed wrestling with deadly Nile crocodiles in a bid to catch as many as possible after 15,000 escaped from a farm. The reptiles, which can grow to 16ft long, were accidentally freed after heavy rain made the nearby Limpopo river flood last weekend. Bosses at the Rakwena Crocodile Farm in the north-east of  the country opened the gates to the animals’ pens to release the rising waters – inadvertently letting their entire stock out. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Brave: Three men pin down a crocodile so they can tie its claws and jaws with plastic ties . Caught: At least 2,000 of the crocodiles are believed to have been recaptured since they escaped last weekend . Danger: Nile crocodiles are meat eaters and have been known to attack humans . The reptiles have since been spotted . all over the local area – including on a school sports field – and . wildlife experts urged local people to avoid the animals and stay . indoors. As the flood waters fell, many have been found trapped in the branches of trees. The Nile crocodile is the largest crocodile in Africa and the second-largest in the world after the saltwater crocodile. Prey consists of gazelles, antelope, waterbuck, sitatunga, lechwe, wildebeest, zebras, warthogs, giraffes and Cape buffalos. They are also known to eat domestic animals such chickens, goats, sheep and cattle and are known to attack humans. Males typically measure between 3.5 and 5 metres but very old, mature ones can grow to 5.5 m or more. They are found in Somalia, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Egypt, Tanzania, Burundi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Gabon, South Africa, Malawi, Sudan, South Sudan, Botswana, and Cameroon. Isolated populations also exist in Madagascar and in Senegal. But as this incredible footage shows, many residents showed no fear in tackling the crocodiles themselves. At least 2,000 had been caught by Friday according to South Africa's Afrikaans language Beeld newspaper. Police have been leading the hunt which has mainly taken place at night because their eyes reflect in the torchlight and they are easier to find. The video shows locals pinning the crocodiles to the ground and then handcuffing them with plastic ties. Earlier this week, the crocodile farm's boss Zane Langman told the Beeld that he has been recapturing the animals whenever he is alerted to one. He said he had already caught 'a few . thousand' in the dense bush and orange groves next to his farm, but he . told the newspaper that 'more than half' of his reptiles are still . missing. Commercial . crocodile farms breed the animals for their skin, which is used to make . crocodile leather for items such as belts, shoes and handbags. There is also a small market for . crocodile meat, but most often the dead reptile's is fed to other crocs . as the species is cannibalistic. The . commercial crocodile farming industry is small, but growing, in South . Africa, where there are around 60 farms containing a total of around . 500,000 animals. Because the quality of the skin is . paramount, some farms keep each crocodile in its own, battery-style pen . so that its hide is not scratched or otherwise damaged by other animals. However this has lead to allegations of animal cruelty and most farms keep the animals in communal pens. Nile . Crocodiles are meat eating and can grow to up to five metres long. They . can run at up to eight miles an hour and swim at up to 22 mph. They . are extremely dangerous to humans. Their preferred method of killing is . to grab an animal in their enormous jaws then drag it, alive, . underwater to drown it. Blunder: The crocodiles were accidentally released after farmers tried to release excess flood water from their pens . An estimated 15,000 crocodiles have escaped from the Rakmena Farm in South Africa where they are bred for their skin which is used in handbags, belts and shoes .

"Action hero Mark Wahlberg isn’t taking any chances. With terror threats heating up worldwide, and today being the 13th anniversary of 9/11, the actor made a last minute decision to cancel plans for him and his entourage to fly from Boston to LA on a commercial flight. On September 11th, 2001, the 43-year-old Transformers star was actually booked on the doomed American Airlines Flight 11 that left Boston’s Logan Airport and flew into the North Tower of the World Trade Center killing all 92 passengers on board. Scroll down for video . Fate:  Mark Wahlberg made a last-minute decision to cancel plans for him and his entourage to fly from Boston to LA on a commercial flight . Horror: 'If I was on the plane with my kids, it wouldn't have went down like it did,’ Wahlberg said at the time. ‘There would have been a lot of blood in that first class cabin . But a few days earlier he changed his plans and flew to Toronto when a friend asked him to view his film at the Toronto Film Festival, sparing his life. At the time Wahlberg was criticized for claiming that, had he been on board, things may have played out much differently. ‘If I was on the plane with my kids, it wouldn’t have went down like it did,’ he said at the time. ‘There would have been a lot of blood in that first class cabin and then me saying, okay we’re going to land somewhere safely, don’t worry.’ He later issued an apology. ‘To speculate about such a situation is ridiculous to begin with, and to suggest I would have done anything differently than the passengers on that plane was irresponsible. I deeply apologize to the families of the victims that my answer came off as offensive; it was certainly not my attention.’ Bi-coastal: Wahlberg, his co-stars and his crew have been filming Ted 2 in Boston when the director decided to move the shoot to LA . Wahlberg, his co-stars and his crew have been filming Ted 2 in Boston and although they were scheduled to continue shooting on the East Coast for another month before moving back to LA, director Seth MacFarlane decided to move the shoot back to the West Coast in order to give it a better loo. He even coughed up a whopping $10 million out of his own pocket to make that happen. ‘Ten million isn’t really that much when you consider the original Ted made close to $300 million,’ says a source. ‘That’s why Mark is leaving the decision to move in Seth’s hands. But when he found out the studio booked passage for the actors and crew on a commercial jet on 9/11, traveling that same route – Boston to LA - he decided to rent a private jet to help insure the group’s safety. ‘Mark has never really gotten over the fact that if he hadn’t made the last minute decision to fly to Toronto, he would have been on board that doomed flight,’ says the source. ‘And he just wasn’t willing to take any chances on 9/11 of anything happening when he’s already cheated death once.’","Transformers star Mark Wahlberg was supposed to be on the flight that crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center on September 11 .

"Madonna has been accused of blackmail, demanding special treatment and bullying state officials in Malawi – the country that once dubbed her a ‘saint’. In an extraordinary outburst, the president of the African state even told the billionaire singer she ought to take lessons in manners from Premiership footballers Rio Ferdinand and Gary Neville. President Joyce Banda claims the 54-year-old, who adopted two of her four children from Malawi, has failed to keep her promise to spend money improving infrastructure in the impoverished nation. Scroll down for video . Unwanted guest: The President of Malawi blasted Madonna, claiming that she reneged on her promise to build a $15 million academy for girls, after receiving a tatty letter . [caption . But Madonna’s management claim the . ‘nonsense’ attack is retaliation for the singer sacking president . Banda’s sister from one of her charity organisations amid allegations . funds were mishandled. In a statement following Madonna’s . latest visit, President Banda accused her of wanting the government to . ‘roll out the red carpet’, adding: ‘If Madonna believes she deserved to . be treated differently . . . it is worth making her aware that Malawi . has hosted many international stars, including Chuck Norris, Bono, David . James, Rio Ferdinand and Gary Neville, who have never demanded state . attention or decorum despite their equally dazzling stature.’ The singer said she was ‘saddened’ by . the ‘ridiculous allegations’. Her relationship with Malawi began with . her pledge to donate millions to set up schools, orphanages and medical . centres. The promise appeared to fast-track her adoption of son David in . 2006. She adopted daughter Mercy James in 2009. The statement went on to say Madonna had not been invited by the president - and should stop exaggerating her contributions to the country. It said: 'Among the many things that Madonna needs to learn as a matter of urgency is the decency of telling the truth. 'For her to tell the whole world that she is building schools in Malawi when she has actually only contributed to the construction of classrooms is not compatible with the manners of someone who thinks she deserves to be revered with state grandeur. 'The difference between a school and a classroom should be the most obvious thing for a person demanding state courtesy to decipher.' It comes as claims of a feud between Madonna - who has two adopted children from Malawi, David Banda and Mercy Jones - and the President Joyce Banda. The statement said a pop star was not automatically deserving of a state welcome or extra attention.'In the feeling of Madonna, the Malawi Government and its leadership should have rolled out a red carpet and blasted the 21-gun salute in her honour because she believes that as a musician, the whiff of whose repute flies across international boundaries, she automatically is candidate for VIP treatment,' the statement read. 'Granted, Madonna has adopted two children from Malawi. According to the record, this gesture was humanitarian and of her accord. 'It, therefore, comes across as strange and depressing that for a humanitarian act, prompted only by her, Madonna wants Malawi to be forever chained to the obligation of gratitude. 'Kindness, as far as its ordinary meaning is concerned, is free and anonymous. 'If it can't be free and silent, it is not kindness; it is something else. Blackmail is the closest it becomes.' Whistle stop tour: Madonna is in the country with her adopted Malawian children Mercy and David . The statement finished by saying the Malawi Government continues to . welcome philanthropists hoping to improve the welfare for the people of . Malawi. The President of Malawi has given . Madonna an astonishing verbal slap down in which she accuses the pop . star of coming close to 'blackmailing' the impoverished African country. The sarcasm-laden statement . criticises Madonna for believing that 'she is....doing Malawi good' and . that she therefore 'automatically [a] candidate for VIP treatment.' After noting that Madonna has adopted . two Malawian children as her own, the very strongly-worded statement . goes on to accuse the singer of near blackmail. 'It....comes . across as strange and depressing that for a humanitarian act.... Madonna wants Malawi to be forever chained to the obligation of . gratitude. 'Kindness, as far as its ordinary meaning is concerned, is free and anonymous. 'If . it can’t be free and silent, it is not kindness; it is something else. Blackmail is the closest it becomes', the statement, which was reported . in Malawi’s Nyasa Times newspaper read. Madonna . has been a frequent visitor the impoverished southern African country . since she adopted two children - David and Mercy - from there in 2006 . and 2009 respectively. Promotion: Madonna uses her star power to highlight the struggle for children in Malawi . Tour: The Executive Director of Mphandula Children Care Centre briefed Madonna on what children learn at the centre during her visit . Skills: Madonna watched tailoring students work during her visit to the care centre . However, the Material Girl’s . relationship with the country has soured, primarily over accusations . that she failed to make good on a promise to invest in local schooling. Malawi’s new, forthright, president Dr . Banda is also reportedly fed up with the pop star’s portrayal of the . country as a helpless basketcase. This latest war of words comes after . Madonna was stripped of her VVIP (Very, Very Important Person) status on . a recent trip to the country. As a result she and her large entourage - . which included four of her children -were forced to go through Kamuzu . airport alongside ordinary passengers when they left the country on . Saturday. During . the ten days the party had spent in the country, Malawi’s education . minister accused Madonna of “exaggerating” the extent of her charitable . work. What’s more, a handwritten request by Madonna for an audience with President Joyce Banda was left unanswered. The . singer’s spokesman reportedly claimed that double snub was prompted by . President Banda’s sister Anjimile Oponyo whom Madonna sacked as the head . of her Raising Malawi charity amid denied allegations of theft. Trying it out: Madonna wore a piece of cloth sewn by children at the centre as her adopted son David watched . Giving a hand: The US performer greeted volunteers at the Mphandula orphanage near Lilongwe . The extraordinary statement from the . Malawian government addressed the singer’s gripes directly - and . contrasts her behaviour with other celebrities including English . footballers David James, Rio Ferdinand and Gary Neville whom, the . statement claims, “have never demanded state attention or decorum . despite their equally dazzling stature”. The . statement reads: “Granted, Madonna is a famed international musician. But that does not impose an injunction of obligation on any government . under whose territory Madonna finds herself, including Malawi, to give . her state treatment. 'As stated earlier....such treatment, even if she deserved it, is discretionary not obligatory. 'It . should be put on record that Madonna did not come to Malawi at the . invitation of the President nor her government. In other words, she was . neither the guest of the President nor of her government. 'For all that is known, she came to . Malawi like any other visitor that feels like coming to Malawi. Such . visitors don’t have to meet with the President and are never amenable to . state attention or graces. 'If the argument is that because she is . an internationally renowned star, and, therefore, Madonna believes she . deserved to be treated differently from other visiting foreigners, it is . worth making her aware that Malawi has hosted many international stars, . including Chuck Norris, Bono, David James, Rio Ferdinand and Gary . Neville who have never demanded state attention or decorum despite their . equally dazzling stature. Medical support: Madonna met the patients at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital . 'Among the many things that Madonna . needs to learn as a matter of urgency is the decency of telling the . truth. For her to tell the whole world that she is building schools in . Malawi when she has actually only contributed to the construction of . classrooms is not compatible with manners of someone who thinks she . deserves to be revered with state grandeur. The difference between a . school and a class room should be the most obvious thing for a person . demanding state courtesy to decipher. 'For her to accuse Mrs. Oponyo for . indiscretions that have clearly arisen from her personal frustrations . that her ego has not been massaged by the state is uncouth, and speaks . volumes of a musician who desperately thinks she must generate . recognition by bullying state officials instead of playing decent music . on the stage.” The statement, issued by Malawi . government press officer Tusekele Mwanyongo concludes that “acts of . kindness must always remain as such; they must not smack of blackmail. In addition, let philanthropists not hold to ransom the President and . any official of her Government because they showed some kindness to any . Malawian.' But a counter statement issued by the popstar accused President Banda of telling lies. Madonna said: 'I'm saddened that Malawi president Joyce Banda has chosen to release lies about what we've accomplished, my intentions, how I personally conducted myself while visiting Malawi and other untruths. 'I did not ever ask or demand special treatment at the airport or elsewhere during my visit. 'I will not be distracted or discouraged by other people's political agendas. 'I made a promise to the children of Malawi and I'm keeping that promise.'

"The Syrian refugee crisis escalates as some 100,000 refugee fled Syria, the highest monthly total since the hostilities started 17 months ago, U.N. figures reveal. The tide in people fleeing the civil war, a figure that includes both refugees who are registered and those awaiting registration with the Geneva-based U.N. refugee agency, highlights the growing violence between the regime of Syria's president, Bashar Assad, and the armed anti-government groups. The refugee situation worsened as activists say some 5,000 people were killed in August, the bloodiest month so far in the 17-month-old uprising and more than three times the monthly average. GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING . Bloodiest month: August has seen the largest amount of Syrian refugees flee the country as activists claim it to also be the bloodiest as violence continues such as this car bomb which ripped through Jaramana, a suburb of Damascus yesterday . The U.N. children's agency says 1,600 were killed last week alone, also the highest figure for the entire revolt. The August refugee total represents more than 40 per cent of the 234,368 Syrian refugees who, as of the last count on September 2, had fled for surrounding countries since the uprising began 17 months ago. U.N. refugee agency spokesman Melissa Fleming said at the U.N.’s European headquarters in Geneva: ‘If you do the math, it's quite an astonishing number and it points to a significant escalation in refugee movement and people seeking asylum, and probably points to a very precarious and violent situation inside the country.’ Escalating violence: This wounded little boy in Aleppo was one of the lucky ones as U.N. figures revealed that 1,600 children were killed last week alone . Precarious: The significant refugee movement points to a 'very precarious and violent situation inside the country,' U.N. spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said as this Free Syria Army fighter received treatment in Aleppo . The refugee agency and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent are continuing to expand their operations to support displaced Syrians and are appealing to all nations to take in Syrians who need asylum. There are now more than 80,000 Syrian refugees in Turkey, where the borders remain open, but there is a backlog of some 8,000 Syrians waiting to be processed at the border, Ms Fleming said. Jordan has more than 77,000 Syrian refugees, Lebanon has more than 59,000 and Iraq nearly 18,700 according to the agency. Total refugees: There are more than 80,000 Syrian refugees in Turkey but there is a backlog of 8,000 Syrians waiting to be processed at the border as the conflict rages on as shown on Shaam News Network in Aleppo . Among the rubble: The two major activist groups, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Local Coordination Committees, have raised their total death toll to 23,000-26,000. Pictured are people after shelling in Idlib . Food aid: This building was damaged yesterday by a car bomb as the U.N. announced plans to increase operations providing food urgently needed by 1.5million people in areas where there has been fighting and people have been left homeless . The U.N.'s World Food Program . spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs said that her agency is scaling up operations . to provide food urgently needed by 1.5 million people this month, . mainly in areas where there has been fighting and people made at least . temporarily homeless. The fighting has spread to the country's two largest cities, the capital Damascus and the commercial hub of Aleppo, where more than 264,000 people are taking shelter in public buildings in the Aleppo region. About 200,000 are in rural areas and more than 64,000 are in the city proper, Ms Byrs said. The two major activist groups, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Local Coordination Committees, have raised their total death toll to between 23,000 and 26,000. More assistance: Peter Maurer, left, the new president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, has urged the respect of international humanitarian law and the need to boost assistance on the ground as he met volunteers in Damascus today . Welcomed aid: President Bashar Assad is said to have welcomed humanitarian operations as long as it remains 'impartial and independent' The new president of the International . Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), veteran Swiss diplomat Peter Maurer, . met in Damascus with Assad on Tuesday. Maurer urged respect for international . humanitarian law and the need to boost assistance on the ground in . Syria, ICRC spokesman Hisham Hassan said in a statement. State television said Assad told Maurer that he supports the work of the ICRC in Syria so long as it remains ‘impartial and independent’. State television said: ‘President Assad assured the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross that he welcomed the humanitarian operations carried out by the committee on the ground in Syria, as long as it remains impartial and independent.’ Syria's state-run SANA news agency reported that Assad told the Red Cross it was welcome to operate on the ground in Syria ‘as long as it works in a neutral and independent way’. A fifth meeting of the U.N.-sponsored Syrian Humanitarian Forum, made up of hundreds of nations, regional groups, U.N. agencies and non-governmental organizations, is also planned for Friday in Geneva. At the last meeting in mid-July the operations director for the U.N.'s humanitarian office said its appeal for $189 million to help people inside Syria was only 20 per cent funded.

"Rafael Nadal's coach has criticised the appointment of Gala Leon Garcia as the captain of Spain's Davis Cup team. The Spanish Tennis Federation (RFET) handed 40-year-old Leon Garcia responsibility for the country's Davis Cup team following Carlos Moya's decision to step aside last week. Leon Garcia, the former world number 27, becomes Spain's first female Davis Cup captain and just the fifth in the competition's history. Toni Nadal, uncle and coach of Rafael, sounded puzzled when asked about Gala Leon Garcia's appointment . Toni Nadal, Rafael's coach and uncle, tells Onda Cero radio 'it is preferable that (the Davis Cup captain) is someone with a background in the world of men's tennis.' He says 'the men's game isn't the same as the women's game, on the tactical level.' Toni Nadal believes Leon's appointment could create problems 'at dressing room level'. 'I have had zero relations with Gala Leon and I believe Rafa Nadal also zero, he has never mentioned it to me,' he said. 'But it doesn't matter, I have never spoken to her but that doesn't mean anything. 'It would seem to be more normal if the captain had been someone like Juan Carlos Ferrero, or some ex-player of a certain level, which is what has happened recently.' Former world number one Ferrero, who retired in 2012, has expressed a desire to captain the team one day. Leon Garcia, pictured here playing in 2001, was announced as Spain's new Davis Cup captain . Moya quit after five-times winners Spain, fielding a weakened team, were relegated from the elite World Group for the first time in 18 years after a playoff loss in Brazil. The RFET said in a statement on Monday that Leon Garcia, who quit the tour in 2004, would take on Moya's responsibilities as part of her role in charge of the federation's sporting management. While Toni Nadal sounded unenthusiastic, Leon Garcia received support from Britain's two-time grand slam champion Andy Murray who broke the mould earlier this year by deciding to employ former French player Amelie Mauresmo as his coach. 'Congrats to Gala Leon Garcia for becoming first female Spanish Davis Cup captain today... hopefully first of many,' said the Scot on Twitter. Carlos Moya (left) stood down as captain after Spain were relegated from the World Group in Brazil . Moya stood down after less than a year in charge when Spain dropped out of the World Group, citing the unavailability of several top players as one of the factors in his decision. Nadal did not play in Brazil because of a wrist injury that has sidelined him since Wimbledon. Spain's number two David Ferrer was also absent. The RFET said full details of Leon Garcia's appointment would be disclosed on Tuesday in Seville.","Toni Nadal, uncle and coach of Rafael, said Leon Garcia's appointment could cause problems 'at dressing room level'

"South Africa's deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa pointed out the group of whites as proof that the ANC appealed beyond its core black constituency . South Africa's ruling African National Congress has been accused of bribing poor white people to attend a party rally in an attempt to bolster its multi-racial credentials. The ANC's alleged 'hire a white' scheme was exposed after more than a 100 poor white people sat in the front few rows of a political rally in the north of the country. Speaking at the conference, on Saturday, South Africa's billionaire deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa pointed out the group of whites as proof that the ANC appealed beyond its core black constituency. 'This is the proof [we are] the party for everyone', he said. Despite it being 19 years since the end of apartheid in South Africa, the country remains divided by race, especially when it comes to politics. Photographs of Saturday's ANC rally in the Free State town of Welkom showed the small group of white people sitting together at the front of a large marquee which was otherwise filled with black people. The pictures showed how many of the white people at the rally had pulled yellow ANC T-shirts featuring pictures of South Africa's president Jacob Zuma over their normal clothes. Despite this show of apparent support for President Zuma, some of the whites in the T-shirts told a local newspaper that they did not know who he was. The Afrikaans language Volksblad newspaper reported that many of the group seemed 'confused', saying they only attended the rally in order to obtain free food parcels. 'I did not even know that we would be brought to the conference,' one of the white visitors was quoted as telling the newspaper. Although South Africa's ruling ANC is overwhelmingly popular among the country's blacks - who make up 80 per cent of its population - it struggles for votes among the country's other apartheid era race groups: namely whites, Indians and mixed race people. However, in recent years some black . voters have abandoned the party of liberation in frustration with high . levels of corruption and unemployment. South African President Jacob Zuma (left) with deputy Cyril Ramaphosa, pictured last year in recent years some black voters have abandoned the party of liberation in frustration with high levels of corruption and unemployment . As they have started to desert the party - whose figurehead Nelson Mandela became the country's first black president in 1994 - the ANC has started to look for support elsewhere. It appears to have turned South Africa's small population of poor, rural, Afrikaans-speaking white people, some of whom may sympathise with the party's message of fighting exploitation with strong labour laws. Sandlana Smit, a local ANC politician with responsibility for minorities denied that the white delegates were part of a 'hire-a-white' election strategy or that the group had been promised food parcels. She explained that some of them may not have know who President Zuma was because they were too poor to have access to the media. She went on to claim that many white South Africans support the ANC.","Group of white people photographed at the front of ANC rally .

"A young couple are believed to have died of carbon monoxide poisoning after parking their car in a garage for some 'hanky panky', it was revealed today. The bodies of Melissa Pereira, 25, and Jorge Rodriguez, 24, were found on Sunday, three weeks after they mysteriously disappeared on their way to a romantic break to celebrate their anniversary at a Pennsylvania bed and breakfast on December 27. On the day they were last seen Melissa and Jorge stocked up on Campbell’s soup at Kmart and ate at Burger King before they went out for the late night drive, family members said. Jorge Rodriguez, 24, and his girlfriend Melissa Pereira, 25, were last seen leaving her home in Wayne, New Jersey, on Dec. 27 . Grisly find: The couple are believed to have become overwhelmed by carbon monoxide fumes inside this garage. When they were found the car's gas tank empty and the battery was dead . A giddy Melissa Pereira even tweeted affectionately about their upcoming trip on the day they disappeared. ‘Weekend with my everything :) #lovehim’. It would be her final tweet. But they never checked into their hotel. They had vanished. But there was no reason to suspect they eloped, they . were not in trouble and neither was their any reason why they would be . driven to suicide. ‘They had plans to go on the trip,’ Pereira’s uncle Sham Bacchus told MailOnline. ‘This is too much, she and Jorge had their whole lives ahead of them.’ Then on Sunday, detectives descended on garage number 55 inside the Wayne Village Apartment complex in New Jersey. Inside the 10-by-12-foot structure were the lovers’ lifeless bodies slumped over the front seats of Rodrigeuz’s white Honda Prelude, the gas tank empty, the battery dead. Bacchus, 45, told MailOnline he suspects the couple retreated to the garage for a little fun. ‘They’re kids,’ he said. ‘They might have wanted some quiet time together’, but added that when their bodies were found 'they had their clothes on'. There they they may have become . overwhelmed by odorless carbon monoxide fumes after turning on the car . to keep warm with the garage door shut. All of Pereira’s personal items were left at home, Bacchus said, and he added that they had ‘their clothes on.’ ‘This has to be an accident,' he said. Nicole Trifari, a neighbor living in the complex who was the last person to see the couple alive as they shut the garage door, told MailOnline how she is haunted by that last interaction. Trifari, 24, was outside her apartment sipping coffee while her boyfriend smoked a cigarette just before midnight on December 27. She said Rodriguez and Pereira pulled-up and idled in the parking lot for several minutes. Then Rodriguez, who was behind the wheel, hopped out of the car and tried to use a key to open a garage door. When that failed Trifari and her boyfriend became suspicious. ‘We thought he was trying to break in,’ she said. Afterward, Rodriguez used the same key to unlock garage number 55. The couple had been dating for about two years and were said to be very happy and excited for the future . ‘He gets back in the car and that’s when the girl looks over at me,’ Trifari said. ‘She smiled. She acknowledged us and we acknowledged her. They back in and he got out and closed the garage.’ While Trifari thought the late-night rendezvous in a grungy garage was ‘strange’ she also suspected the couple wanted privacy. ‘I thought they were going in there to have a little hanky-panky,’ she said. ‘I thought they’re doing whatever they’re doing and I wasn’t about to go and knock on the door.’ Trifari and her boyfriend decided to turn in for the night she said they ‘never thought about it again.’ On Sunday Trifari awoke to a phalanx of cops outside her doorstep and watched two bodies being plucked from the Honda get placed into a van. ‘I see the front end of the car and I told my boyfriend, “You’ve got to be kidding me. They’ve been missing the whole time?”’ Melissa and Jorge met as portrait photographers at a JC Penny, Bacchus said. Pereira worked at Fox News as a technical editor, her uncle said, before returning to school. She split time as a photographer at JC Penny and worked in the technology department at the Boys and Girls Club. ‘They . had a very loving relationship,’ Bacchus said. ‘Jorge spent more time . at her house than he did at his own house. There were conversations . about getting married in the future, yes.' Michael . DeMarco, chief assistant with the Passaic County Prosecutor's Office . told MailOnline when they made the grim discovery there wasn’t a suicide . note found and no outward signs of trauma detected. Intimate: A neighbor who saw them enter the garage at first thought they were burglars but told MailOnline she soon realized they were probably going in there for 'hanky panky'. Melissa posted this picture of the couple on Twitter . ‘These are kids who were in love. Something happened and we’re trying to piece together what it was.’ Family members of Rodriguez said that suicide ‘wasn’t an option.’ ‘It’s a horrible accident,’ one relative who requested anonymity told MailOnline. ‘They’re a loving couple and they would not kill themselves.’ Neither Jorge or Melissa canceled their $195 per night reservation to the Cherry Valley Manor Bed and Breakfast in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. But when the couple were no-shows, innkeeper Julia Manovscaia said Melissa's mother Bibi called asking for her daughter. Manovscaia reimbursed the money Melissa put down for the two nights to her mother. But Bacchus also expressed concern over why it took so long to find the couple. Bacchus, a school principal, said he physically went over to the garage after noticing the one and only key was missing. ‘I went to the garage and banged on that garage on Monday night after we filed the police report.’ He said he informed cops about the storage garage when his family filed the missing report on December 30. ‘We told them about the garage,’ he said. ‘Sometimes you wonder if full attention was given – those types of things you wonder. ‘But as a public servant myself I want to give everyone the benefit of the doubt.’ Michael DeMarco, of the Possaic County Prosecutor's Office, claims cops never sat on the garage as a possible lead. ‘When . detectives became aware that there was a garage owned by the family . they followed it up and lo and behold they were inside the garage.’ So in love: Family and friends say there is no reason the couple may have wanted to take their own lives. They were looking forward to their anniversary and had a bright future together . Bacchus also has concerns that Melissa was found in possession of her iPhone. ‘That’s the craziest thing that Melissa’s cell phone was still active,’ he said. ‘We asked the cops to track her cell phone and since there were two police departments involved I don’t think there was enough evidence for them to issue it.’ Whatever the holdups with the investigation, Bacchus says the family is mourning. Jorge will be buried on Sunday and Melissa's funeral will take place Monday. ‘What has happened, happened,’ he said through tears. ‘I can’t bring my niece back. I feel extremely sorry for my sister because she has to bury her child. ‘Melissa and Jorge were her life. I can’t explain it in words.’ Donation sites have been set up to help raise money for the young couples' burials. For Melissa click here.

"The Chicago Bears struck early and never trailed as they rode two Martellus Bennett touchdowns to a 27-19 win over the New York Jets on Monday. The Jets trailed 14-0 early on and while the home side battled hard to come back, getting within five points in the fourth quarter, the Bears were able to hold them out. Chicago Bears wide receiver Santonio Holmes (14 celebrates after the Bears beat the New York Jets 27-19 . The Jets had marched into the red zone in the final minute and at fourth and five from the nine-yard-line, quarterback Geno Smith connected with Jeremy Kerley at the back of the end zone, but the wide receiver failed to keep his feet in bounds. Bears' tight end Bennett's two touchdown grabs were from quarterback Jay Cutler, who passed for 225 yards. Wide receiver Alshon Jeffery had 105 yards from eight receptions. Jets quarterback Smith threw for 316 yards and a touchdown but was left to rue two interceptions. The Bears had a fast start when Ryan Mundy intercepted Smith on just the second play in the game, running it back 45 yards for an early 7-0 lead. Bears quarterback Jay Cutler greets New York Jets quarterback Geno Smith (right) after the game . Chicago then took advantage of a muffed punt return by Jalen Saunders that gave them superb field position for Cutler to connect with Bennett four plays later for a seven yard score and 14-0 lead inside the opening six minutes. Two Nick Folk field goals for New York sandwiched a three-pointer from Robbie Gould before Smith connected with wide receiver Jeremy Kerley for 19 yards and a Jets touchdown to narrow the gap to 17-13 by halftime. Bennett's second touchdown early in the third period opened up a 24-13 Bears lead before two Folk field goals pulled the Jets within five at 24-19. Gould then extended the lead with a 45-yard field goal with three and half minutes remaining to ensure the Jets could not come back.

"He was born into a home which could not have been further removed from privilege. Michael Ha, 21, grew up in an East London council house with Chinese parents who spoke little English and got by on benefits, and attended an inner-city state school once branded the ‘worst in Britain’. But when, at the age of ten, the youngster set his heart on going to Cambridge University, he decided no amount of adversity was going to hinder him. Award-winning medical student Michael Ha, middle, with his father Bao Van Ha, and mother, Yen Thang Trinh . Now, after becoming an A-grade A-level pupil, he is the star medical student of St John’s College, Cambridge, and has just won an award for academic excellence. Telling of his rise to success yesterday, he said he hoped he could be an inspiration for other youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds. He said: ‘My parents couldn’t find work because their English wasn’t up to scratch. It was tough but we made do. I never knew any different.’ Michael’s father, Bao Van Ha, 67, worked as a factory welder in Vietnam before moving to Britain in 1980 with his wife Yen Thang Trinh, 58, a seamstress. Michael, seen here posing with a picture he drew of the statue behind him, said he hoped to be an inspiration to other youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds . Michael set his heart on going to Cambridge University when he was just 10 years old . The family lived in a small terrace house in Hackney – an area known for petty crime and gang problems. Michael, the youngest of four siblings, said: ‘There was always trouble on the streets of Hackney. There were times when it got scary. A couple of times people tried to mug me. But I managed to stay out of trouble. I just kept my head down.’ Michael, in his cap and gown, at his graduation . At 11 Michael started at the new Mossbourne Academy, which had replaced Hackney Downs School – described by a Tory government as ‘the worst school in Britain’. The new school was run by inspirational headteacher Sir Michael Wilshaw, who is now chief inspector of schools at Ofsted. As well as passing his A-levels with flying colours, Michael also got an A in AS-level further maths – after teaching himself from a textbook in just four months ‘as a bet’ with a friend. ‘I always saw Cambridge as this mythical place where the best would go,’ Michael said. ‘I was really ambitious and I dreamt of going there myself.’ Michael applied for St John’s College to do medicine – one of the most competitive courses. He will resume his medical studies at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge and hopes to become a reconstructive surgeon. ‘I want other people to know they shouldn’t be afraid of Cambridge and Oxford,’ he said. ‘All the tutors are looking for is the brightest people in the country. If you work hard, it will be within your grasp.’","Michael Ha set his heart on going to Cambridge University at age 10 .

"author] . This is the £900,000 mansion which will become home to a newly-appointed bishop in a controversial move away from his traditional historic palace.

Parts of the stunning moated property - . which sits in 14 acres in the shadow of Wells Cathedral - are open to . the public and church chiefs wanted somewhere with 'more privacy' The bishop and his wife Jane (pictured right) and his former residence . So they are buying an impressive Grade II-listed Georgian former rectory - set within its own walled grounds - to be his new residence. The sale of the imposing Old Rectory in Croscombe is yet to be completed, but church commissioners have confirmed the four-bed home has been chosen for the bishop and his wife Jane. However, some local residents believe the palace “comes with the job” and the Bishop’s move will diminish the significance of the building. Nick Wride said: “Having a resident bishop gives a prestige to the palace and encourages more visitors as well as providing a better spiritual connection for those attending the religious services.“As it is no longer to be the Bishop’s Palace what are we going to call it - The ex-bishop’s Palace? “As usual the Church is out of touch with the people it is there to support and tends to forget that without us there would be no Church nor commissioners, just more faceless people sitting in ivory towers with spread sheets for another soulless and empty historic tourist attraction.” Palace volunteer steward Rosie Inge said: “I’m angry that no one seems to have been consulted about this. The Old Rectory in Croscombe boasts a . host of period details including huge shuttered sash windows, picture . rails and pretty ceiling roses, with four bedrooms and three bathrooms . upstairs . The kitchen comes complete with central breakfast bar . The tastefully decorated master bedroom . “I think living in the palace goes with the job. If you take the bishop out of the palace then the life will be removed and it will be just another historic building.” The Old Rectory in Croscombe boasts a host of period details including huge shuttered sash windows, picture rails and pretty ceiling roses, with four bedrooms and three bathrooms upstairs. Dual-aspect dining and drawing rooms make the most of the surrounding countryside and the property boasts two halls and underground cellars. The Bishop’s Palace has been a regular home to the Bishops of Bath and Wells since the mid 1850s. Andrew Brown, secretary to the Church Commissioners, said: “The decision to move the bishop’s home will mean he can live in more privacy as the palace and gardens will remain open to the public.“The Bishop will continue to work and worship at the Palace and share the office with the Bishop of Taunton.” Sarah Moore, visitor services manager at the Palace, said the Bishop did not make the decision to move. She added: “The rich story of The Bishop’s Palace is ever evolving and it is an opportunity for us in 2014 to look at new ways of sharing surprising and fascinating details about the relationship that bishops past and present have had with the City of Wells and the Palace. “We are eagerly anticipating the arrival of Bishop Peter and his wife, Jane to the Diocese. We know that it was not his decision to live elsewhere and we look forward to warmly welcoming him in 2014. “We are confident that The Bishop’s Palace will never be ‘just another historic building’ - the strength of its unique past, present and future will not allow for that to happen.” The Bishop’s Palace has been a regular home to the Bishops of Bath and Wells since the mid 1850s .","The Right Reverend Peter Hancock's previous home was open to the public .

"Two crocodiles have been shot and their stomachs opened in the grim search for a 12-year-old boy feared to have been grabbed by one of the reptiles in Australia's remote Kakadu National Park. The large reptiles were shot during the night as police and park rangers patrolled the stretch of water where the boy and a group of friends were swimming. Another 12-year-old was bitten on the arm but miraculously managed to escape being fatally injured. The crocodile then turned on his friend and carried him away. Scroll down for video . A saltwater crocodile lurks in the water at Kakadu National Park: Human remains - believed to be those of a 12-year-old boy snatched by a saltie - have been found by police . A crocodile expert was today examining the bite marks on the arm of the survivor in the hope of establishing the size of the attacking reptile to prevent numerous 'innocent' creatures being shot. Police sergeant Stephen Constable said other officers and park rangers had located two large crocodiles in the Mudginberri billabong in the early hours of the morning in the area where the boy was taken. 'One was 4.3 metres and one was 4.7 metres,'  Sergeant Constable told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 'Both of those were shot and removed from the area. 'We've since had a look at both crocodiles and neither of them had anything in their stomachs and we're now going to continue the search.' He added that it was hoped that the bite marks on the arm of the surviving boy would 'give us a rough idea of how large the crocodile was.' Officials have been searching the area, around 140 miles east of Darwin, since early Sunday afternoon after the alarm was raised. Police have also spoken to four of the boys from a nearby Aboriginal settlement who witnessed the terrifying attack. Kakadu is where the original Crocodile Dundee movie was made. Twelve months ago another teenager fought off a five metre saltwater crocodile in the same area, resulting in warnings being stepped up about the dangers of crocs in Northern Territory rivers and waterways. Because there have been no attacks in the Mudginberri billabong area in recent times, police believe the boys entered the water without looking around for crocodiles that might be lurking there. The current wet season is the most dangerous time of year to be swimming in the Territory's waters. Remote: The park boasts stunning, unspoiled landscapes and sits in the northern part of Australia . The child was taken while swimming in Mudginberri billabong just north of Jabiru in Kakadu National Park . It is understood that privately police and rangers fear there is little chance of the missing boy still being alive - crocodiles usually swim with their prey to the bottom of rivers and perform a 'death roll' until the victim drowns, if death has not already occurred in the reptile's jaws. Saltwater crocodiles - known as salties -  can grow up to seven metres long, weigh more than a tonne, and are a common feature of Australia's tropical north. Their numbers have increased steadily since the introduction of protection laws in 1971, with government estimates putting the population at 75,000-100,000. The most recent fatality was in August last year, when a man was taken by a 4.7-metre croc as he swam across the Mary River. Parks officials said the Magela Creek area was well signposted as a crocodile danger zone. 'We have big croc warning signs with croc jaws and a big thing saying ""croc risk; do not swim here, do not enter"",' a spokeswoman said. Australian researchers launched the world's first crocodile attack database, CrocBITE, last month, hoping to firm up anecdotal reports that harmful or fatal incidents are increasing. Sunday's attack in Kakadu is the 11th fatality recorded so far this year by the CrocBITE team, which is based at Australia's Charles Darwin University. The other crocodile-related deaths in 2014 have been in Angola, East Timor, India, Indonesia, Namibia, Papua New Guinea, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Five have involved saltwater crocs. Thirteen people, including six children, have been killed by crocodiles in Australia in the past 12 years.","Rangers found no evidence of the boy's remains in either crocodile .

"Her own mother bucked the royal trend for traditional baby names when she opted for Zara. So it is not surprising that new mum Zara Phillips decided against going with family favourites such as Elizabeth or Anne. Yesterday the Queen’s grand-daughter and her husband, former England rugby captain Mike Tindall, announced they had named their daughter Mia Grace (pronounced My-ya) for no other reason than ‘they both liked the name’. Scroll down for video . Proud: Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall have named their baby daughter Mia Grace . And they are not the only ones. Mia shot into the chart of the country’s most popular baby names at number seven last year, with 3,524 new Mias in the country. In marked difference from last week’s formal Buckingham Palace announcement of her birth, the news was announced by Tindall on Twitter. He posted: ‘For everyone who has asked what our daughter’s name, it’s Mia Grace Tindall.’ Zara’s spokesman, Susan MacMahon, told the Mail: ‘There is no family connection, no relation with the name, it’s just pure coincidence. They both just really liked the names, particularly Mia.’ Announcement: Mike Tindall and Zara Phillips have revealed that the name of their daughter is Mia Grace . Modern: The baby's name was revealed by the proud father via Twitter today . Bookmakers William Hill dropped its . odds on the name from 16/1 to 5/1 after a surge of bets in the  minutes . before the announcement. ‘There was a late surge of betting for “Mia”, . with one punter wanting £300 on the name,’ spokesman  Jon Ivan-Duke . said. ‘Normally the money . that comes  in on royal baby names tends to be quite small. Ten or . twenty pounds . .. a little here, a little there. So when someone . attempts to put a relatively large amount on all of a sudden,  it tends . to arouse our suspicions. ‘We . decided not to take the bet and do a little checking to see if the . information was out there, and as we were checking the information came . in.’ Mia is of both . Italian and Latin origin and means ‘mine’. In  Danish, it means . ‘beloved’. Grace is a more traditional name, which has long been used to represent the concept of divine grace. In a royal context, it was made famous . by Princess Grace of Monaco, the Hollywood actress who married Prince . Rainier and was considered a global icon of style and glamour. Birth: Zara, pictured shortly before the birth of Mia, left hospital just six hours after the baby was born . Zara gave birth last week to the 7lb 12oz girl, who is 16th in line to the throne and is the Queen's fourth great-grandchild. Tindall . also took to Twitter after the birth to describe his joy at becoming a . father for the first time, saying it was 'definitely the best day of my . life'. However, the couple predicted they . would take some time to come up with a name because they had chosen not . to be told the sex of their child in advance. Zara, . a silver medal-winning Olympian who is one of Britain's leading . equestrian riders, gave birth to her first child at Gloucestershire . Royal Hospital with her husband at her side. She . is the daughter of Princess Anne, but does not hold a royal title after . her mother decided not to pass on her status to her children. Mia Grace will also not hold any royal or aristocratic title. When Zara herself was born, her name was likewise a break from tradition as it had no precedent in the royal family. Grandmother: Princess Anne last week at the Gatcombe Park estate, where her grandchild is believed to be . staying with Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall . A new arrival: Zara's brother Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn were seen leaving the estate after welcoming Mia into the world . With . a wide circle of friends and family that includes an eclectic mix of . royalty, rugby players and racing folk, there’s no shortage of . candidates for the role of Mia's godparent. The Duke and . Duchess of Cambridge are both possible options as is Prince Harry, . because Zara is known to be close to her cousins and is godmother to . Prince George. Another . royal who could be asked is Zara’s brother Peter Phillips or his wife . Autumn Kelly, and other Windsors such as Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie . are also in the frame. Zara’s . best friend, racehorse trainer, Dolly Maude, is a likely choice - Zara . is already godmother to her seven-year-old son Ted Maude. Ms . Maude was also a maid of honour at Zara’s 2011 wedding to Mike Tindall, . where she shared the honours with Stephanie Phillips, Zara’s . 15-year-old half-sister and another potential godparent. The use of Twitter to announce the . name of the baby stands in stark contrast to how the birth of her second . cousin Prince George was revealed to the world. When . the son of Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge was born last . year, the official announcement of the birth came on an easel placed . outside Buckingham Palace. Zara . has said that she plans to return to riding as soon as possible . following Mia's birth - just like Anne, who did not allow becoming a . mother to interrupt her sporting career. In . an early sign of her no-nonsense approach to motherhood, Zara left . hospital last week after just six hours and returned to the Gatcombe . Park estate in Gloucestershire, where she was joined by Anne and by her . brother Peter. The early betting was on a more . traditional name for the new royal baby with Charlotte, Victoria, Anne . and Elizabeth among the front runners. But bookmakers William Hill said Mia entered the betting yesterday afternoon at odds of 16-1 and finished as the 5-1 favourite. Spokesman . Rupert Adams said: 'It looks like a few people managed to get Mia . correct and we have now lost for the second time running. 'We might have to close that betting early for the next royal baby - be it William or Harry.' Home: The latest addition to the royal family will grow up on Anne's Gatcombe Park estate near Minchinhampton . Rider: Zara plans to resume her career as a top horsewoman following the birth of her daughter . The baby girl follows Zara's brother Peter Phillips' two children and Prince George to become the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh's fourth great grandchild. Peter Phillips' daughters Savannah and Isla Phillips were also born at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital in Gloucester. Zara and Mr Tindall moved back to Anne's Gatcombe Park estate last January after selling their regency home in Cheltenham. Hospital: Mia Grace was born on January 17 at the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital . The pair first met in a Sydney bar when Mr Tindall was in Australia for the 2003 Rugby World Cup. They married in July 2011 in a ceremony staged in Edinburgh and attended by the Queen and senior royals. Zara won a silver medal at London 2012 with eventing equestrian teammates William Fox-Pitt, Mary King, Tina Cook and Nicola Wilson, and is planning to take part in the Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016.","Rugby star Mike Tendall reveals the name of newborn girl via Twitter .

"An unsuspecting Manchester man had his pizza snatched by a passenger in a passing car - before a video of the  'drive-by' theft was posted online. The victim was standing, holding his takeaway, at a bus stop in the city  when the car  drove past and a man grabbed the food from his hands. The group in the car then posted a film of the incident online, which shows the vehicle slowing down as it passes the bus stop so a man can lean out of the window and snatch the pizza. Scroll down for video . A video posted on YouTube shows 'drive-by' thieves snatching a pizza from a man waiting at a bus stop . As the car draws up, a man leans out of the passenger seat window and grabs the takeaway . The theft took place in the Fallowfield area of the city in the early hours of Saturday morning. It is believed the man who grabbed the pizza was Dan Jackson, 28, from nearby Heald Green, who had been on his way home with friends after celebrating a birthday. But Mr Jackson said he didn't mean to cause offence and has since bought the victim a replacement £12.95 pizza, delivering it to his home. He said: 'We were driving through town and just saw this guy stood at the bus stop, it was hilarious because he was stood holding it out like a waiter. It just had to be done. But police have hit out at the thieves, saying the video shows them driving dangerously through a red light . 'When we found out who it was, we knew we had to replace his pizza and get it back to him. 'We didn't mean to cause any offence, we just wanted to have a laugh, like prank TV.' A video of the incident was filmed from the back seat of the car, which appears to have four men in it. After one of the group says 'ready', the car passes the bus stop and, without stopping, the man in the passenger seat leans out and takes the pizza box. The incident took place at this bus stop (left) in Wilmslow Road, Fallowfield, Manchester on Saturday morning . As a woman at the bus stop screams, the car then speeds up and pulls away as the group inside burst into laughter. Mr Jackson who took the pizza exclaims 'It's a whole pizza' and another replies: 'We need to pull over.' Greater Manchester Police have taken a dim view of the video though, saying the group appear to be driving dangerously. A spokesman said: 'As funny as those in the car seem to think this is, not only have they stolen someone's pizza, it appears from the footage that they drove through a red light. 'The consequences of ignoring traffic lights can be catastrophic and is absolutely no laughing matter.'","Video posted online shows car with three passengers driving up to bus stop .

"Romance, emotion, tears and lots of cringe-worthy moments - that's what to expect at your average wedding, according to a new survey. The poll of 1,500 newlyweds found that the mother of the groom comes top of the list of most embarrassing people on the big day, while the mother of the bride cries on average six times. Inappropriate jokes and fashion faux pas are also regular wedding features with the best man cracking two below the belt gags and, more often than not, two guests turning up in the same outfit. Scroll down for video . Tradition is still key for British couples tying the knot with 39 per cent serving a traditional Sunday Roast for their wedding breakfast and 35 per cent sticking with a traditional theme . And that's not where the cringe-inducing moments end. Twenty two per cent of couples now choreograph a special routine for . their first dance and 15 per cent of couples . are so proud of their achievement that they also share the dance on . YouTube. The new wedding report, commissioned by QHotels, also found that there is on average one unexpected romance at every wedding and five people who can't hold back the tears. British couples still hanker after tradition at their nuptials with 39 per cent serving a traditional Sunday Roast for their wedding breakfast. But only 28 per cent of British couples stick with a traditional church . wedding, compared to 33 per cent who opted for a registry office. The mother of the bride will cry a lot but the mother of the groom is said to be the most embarrassing . Thirty five per cent of UK couples opt for a traditional decor and feel and couples also play it safe when it comes to the weather. Half of all weddings take place in summer, with the other half spread over the rest of the year. The report also found that couples chose . an average of two bridesmaids and two groomsmen. Of the couples . surveyed, all said the people they chose to honour were childhood . friends. The wedding tunes making the big day playlist include Savage Garden's Truly Madly Deeply (chosen by eight per cent polled), The Goo Goo Dolls' Iris (favoured by seven per cent) and both Jason Mraz's I’m Yours and Amazed by Lonestar chosen by five per cent. But however good the music not all wedding guests stay for the long haul - designated drivers call it a night at 11.55pm, although only 55 per cent of couples noticed them leaving.","During the average UK wedding there is one unexpected romance .

"A cat from Devon has a claim to be the oldest moggy in the world after celebrating her 25th birthday. Tortoiseshell 'Putts' was born in January 1989 - several months before the fall of the Berlin Wall. She has lived through five British prime ministers and is now a staggering 120 in human years. She is now thought to be the oldest living cat in the world, beating Guinness World Record holder, US-born Corduroy, by six months. Scroll down for video . Putts, a tortoiseshell from Sidmouth, Devon, is celebrating her 25th year, making her the oldest cat in the world . She was born in the 1989, the same year as the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Tienanmen Square protests . Owner David Willey says living with a younger cat, and taking plenty of catnaps, have kept her youthful . The pet cat from Sidmouth is celebrating her record breaking age by tucking into her favourite meal of chicken and having a nap. Her owner David Willey, 64, said: 'She is an absolutely fantastic cat, and still very happy. We thought we were going to lose her a week or so ago, but she perked up and she's fine now.' 'She loves lying and napping in a quiet little place, and she liked her food too - but we have to break it up for her now.' He added: 'She gets groomed every day and she loves the garden we have. I think she has been kept lively by my wife's cat Millie, who is 14. 'She still likes to play with her now and again, but she doesn't let her get the better of her - my cat has long claws which she uses to keep Millie at bay.' Putts - formerly called Springer - was born in a litter of three to her mother Daisy in January 1989. Her owners say they keep fearing ill health will kill Putts, but she always manages to recover and pull through . Mr Willey says she still has her wits about her and can keep his wife's much-younger cat at bay . Mr Willey and his wife have no proof of Putts's birth, so can't have her amazing age officially recognised . She lived with Mr Willey before he married wife Joyce, 66, seven years ago, and they all now live together with her cat, Millie, and their border collie, Ben. Gardener and decorator Mr Willey said Putts helped him through ill-health before he met Joyce. 'When we lived in a flat together just the two of us she stuck by me,' he said; 'She was with me all the time.' Sadly the couple have no proof of Putts' age so can't officially have her recognised as the oldest living cat in the world. 'Putts is definitely 25 and a half, but I've got no proof of it,' said Mr Willey; 'It's a mystery to us how she's survived so long.' Retired carer Mrs Willey added: 'She's probably living on borrowed time. Sadly we can't keep her going forever.'","Putts, the tortoiseshell from Devon, has been alive for a quarter of a century .

"A man living in London has been arrested on suspicion of making roadside bombs in Iraq in 2007, Scotland Yard has said. The 37-year-old was arrested at his home in the north west of the capital by the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command and officers continue to search the property. The force confirmed the man remains in custody at a south London police station while the search continues. A British military vehicle ablaze after a roadside bomb attack left two soldiers wounded in 2006 . During the 2003-2011 conflict in Iraq, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) accounted for nearly two thirds of all deaths suffered by American and British forces and their allies. At the time, Senior US General John Abizaid described them as 'the single greatest source of our casualties and the enemy's most effective weapon'. The bombs were often placed in drinks cans, food boxes and even animal carcasses by the side of the road to hide them from approaching troops. Insurgents initially used them to stop convoys before opening fire on vehicles, but they were later used the main form of attack. Early versions often used a mobile phone to trigger them, but terrorists later turned to infra-red beams after the US designed a jamming system to stop remotely-controlled devices. Insurgents would often use buses or lorries to slow down columns of military vehicles or force them into booby-trapped routes. In some circumstances, donkey carts loaded with explosives were used in attacks. Iraqis examine the crater left by a roadside bomb which killed four British soldiers in 2007 . The use of the devices led to wholesale changes in the way British armoured cars and jeeps were designed, to deflect the force of the explosions and attempt to keep those inside safe. Iraq was pushed to the brink of civil war in 2006 and 2007 following a surge in sectarian violence, despite the deployment of thousands of extra US troops. It followed the US-led invasion, supported by the UK, that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003. Just a year into the conflict, it emerged that around 70 fighters had moved from Britain to help insurgents, raising fears in MI5 that they would return home and plot attacks in the UK. In 2005, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Al Qaeda leader in Iraq, appealed for volunteers to travel to the country to help disrupt planned elections. Zarqawi was killed in 2006. Both Britain and the US began withdrawing their military forces in 2009, with the last to return home in 2011. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Al Qaeda leader in Iraq, appealed to foreign fighters to travel to Iraq in 2005 .

"It took photographer Saskia Nelson eight years of online dating before she finally found her prince. The most frustrating part of her dating experience? Constantly meeting people who looked nothing like their profile photographs. On one occasion the 44-year-old couldn't find her date in a bar so called his phone only to realise he was standing right next to her - looking utterly different to the hunk she was expecting. On another date destined for failure she says she turned up expecting someone 'who looked like David Beckham' only to to be faced with someone who looked 'more like Columbo'. 'Needless to say, I didn’t stay long,' says the Battersea-based photographer. 'It’s not that I’m shallow about looks - far from it - but it’s about being . honest to people from the outset. Lying about age, height or looks is . not a great way to start a meaningful relationship.' Scroll down for video . Just doing my daily stretches: Sandra Jurkute's Saturday Night's Alright shoot captured her mid workout. Or did it? You caught me!: In another of Sandra's shots she's seen chilling on the grass . 'Even if guys didn't intend to mislead, I found they used out-of-date, blurry photos,' she adds. Inspired . by her uninspiring experiences, Saskia set out to put the online dating . world to right with her company 'Saturday Night's Alright', a . photography firm specialising in online dating profiles. She . left her job as a senior manager in a charity to study photography at . Central St Martins art school before setting up her business in May last . year. Online dater Erica Chamberlain snapped by Saskia . Oh, I didn't notice you there!: Will online daters be attracted to the casual poses? She now . says she has over 200 clients and offers three different packages - a . 30-minute shoot with three images costing £80, an hour shoot and six . images costing £140 and the whole shebang with ten images and a . 90-minute session for £210. Considering . research has found that 90 per cent of online dating decisions are made . according to pictures rather than the written profile, it's not a bad . investment for those looking for love. When . it comes to her dating photography Saskia has a clear ethos - to create . images that have a natural but confident and happy feel. 'The . idea is to create a set of photos that are of professional quality, but . look as though they have been taken while they're out with their . friends - by a friend with a good camera! 'I shoot outdoors and stay away from studios to avoid those embarrassing, naff studio shots which just don't work for dating.' Left: Miche in her previous profile shot, with just an eyebrow of her ex on show; Right: looking confident in her new photograph . Saskia believes that an ideal profile image needs colour and personality, as in Miche's portrait, above . Miche looking happy and confident - two important elements to attract online love interest, according to Saskia . So who has are the Saturday Night's Alright clients? 'They're ready to take dating seriously . and want to do everything they can to give themselves the best . opportunity of finding a compatible partner. And I love knowing that I play a . key role in helping them achieve that. 'I totally understand who my clients are and the journey they are on - and I think they value that.' But . not everyone on 'the journey' is keen to be given the professional . finish.  'It's certainly not for me,' says 35-year-old lawyer Laura. 'There's nothing less attractive than looking like you've made too much . effort and even if they're casual ' But . according to Saskia, clients often find their new profile pictures . bring them dating success. One such singleton, Ollie, swears by his . new-found dating image. 'It's already made a massive difference in a few . days,' he says. Cool or contrived: would you use a professional shot on your dating profile? Cath Pochin, pictured above, has gone the professional route . Brendan Ayre, above, photographed by Saskia.

After: Dee looking casual yet sexy in her updated image . So given . Saskia's expertise on the dating game, what's her advice for creating . the perfect profile shot - whether it's a home snap or a professional? 'Most . people aren’t impressed with out of focus, dark, dingy photos with . messy backgrounds. It's not going to jump off the page and stand out. But my pet hate is when an ex is cropped out the picture. It's such a . turn off. 'I . love profile photos that are bright, well-lit, have pin-sharp focus and . are colourful to help them stand out from the sea of dating photos on . any dating site. 'I . also love a photo which tells people a little about the person’s . personality.

"A bride who broke a leg on her hen do and was wheeled down the aisle in a wheelchair and woolly slippers has finally had her first dance - one year after her wedding. Amanda French, 51, was injured after falling over while rollerskating during her boozy bash two weeks before tying the knot. The bride, from Chorley, Lancashire, had to be wheeled down the aisle and was unable to have her first dance with new husband Paul. Amanda, of Chorley, Lancs, had to be wheeled down the aisle in knitted slippers after breaking her leg on her hen do. Pictured above left being wheeled by groom Paul and right with signing the wedding register . Clumsy bride Amanda French (pictured above with her groom Paul) broke her leg on her hen do while rollerskating - but never considered cancelling her big day . But a year later she is back on her feet and danced with her husband on Sunday as they celebrated their first wedding anniversary. Amanda, nee Cooke, broke two bones in her leg just twelve minutes into a 1970s-themed hen party at a roller rink. She said: 'When I went down everyone was saying I had just got a bump, but I thought it was quite serious. I had to get an ambulance.' Amanda didn't let the wheels and slippers her her spirits down on the big day . 'I told the hen party to carry on and I thought I would meet them later for a meal and go for karaoke and to the pubs,' she says. 'I didn’t want anyone to tell my then husband-to-be so I waited until the last minute. When they said I was having an operation, I knew I wouldn’t make the meal.' Paul, 59, was having his stag party at the same time and Amanda said he ‘wasn’t surprised' when he found out what had happened. It was the second time she had broken a bone roller skating, after breaking her arm at the age of 14. Amanda had a metal pin put in her leg but the couple did not consider cancelling their wedding but it did mean a change of plan to Amanda's footwear. Her wedding heels had to be ditched in favour of a pair of knitted slippers. The bride on a hospital bed in her pink hen do get-up. She says, 'When they said I was having an operation, I knew I wouldn't make the meal' Amanda said: 'I had been for a practice at the venue and walked down the aisle in step to the song I had chosen. 'But I had to be wheeled down the aisle instead. It was different. I didn’t plan on being in a wheelchair, obviously, but it added a bit of humour to the day. 'Everyone rallied round and it was still fantastic. It didn’t spoil it at all.' Amanda spent a couple of weeks in the wheelchair and then months on crutches. The happy couple, who have four children between them, had to postpone their honeymoon, but finally made it to Rome in May.","Amanda French, nee Cooke, 51, from Chorley, Lancashire married Paul .

"Can an app or website really boost your mental health? According to a new study the answer is yes. The research specifically examined websites focusing on the practice of mindfulness - one of the biggest buzzwords of the last 12 months. In psychology it involves consciously directing awareness. The practice is a type of meditation, but rather than clearing the mind, encourages us to acknowledge thoughts and allow them in and then to pass. The trend has spurred a flurry of mindfulness apps and websites promising to improve stress levels using online tools. These include apps like Headspace (created by mindfulness guru Andy Puddicumbe) where you plug in and meditate to the sounds of Andy's voice guiding you through each step. Others use alarms to remind you to be mindful at strategic parts of the day (such as Mindfulness Bell). Mindfulness . The study, by Surrey University, carried out in partnership with the Mental Health Foundation, analysed whether tech-based therapies have real benefits on stress levels and found they can effectively reduce fatigue and negative work-related anxiety and also improve sleep quality.

Stand-out numbers include a sexy jumpsuit in grey lace with cross-over neckline, a leopard print trim blazer with coordinating pencil skirt and a figure-hugging burgundy dress.

"The champagne corks were popping in the Rovers Return as Coronation Street hosted its first ever real-life wedding in Manchester. Andy Daniel and Paul Johnston made history as the first to be married inside the Rovers at the old Granada Studios set in Manchester. The set, where Corrie was filmed for 53 years before moving to its new home on Salford Quays, is now a visitor attraction, and bosses successfully won a wedding licence in June. Paul Johnston (left) and Andy Daniel are the first couple to tie the knot in the Rovers Return . Paul (right) and Andy with their guests inside the nation's most famous pub . It allowed Andy, 37, and Paul, 33, to say 'I do' behind the bar of the famous soap pub, before guests were led out onto the Corrie cobbles to toast the newlyweds. Andy, an events organiser, said: 'We’re both big fans of the show and I think anyone born or living in the UK knows Coronation Street, which makes it such an iconic venue. 'We wanted to do something totally different for our wedding, and you can’t get much better than marrying in the nation’s most famous pub.' Paul said: 'My background is in TV journalism so I’ve written about plenty of soap weddings, so it seemed entirely apt to have one of my own - although we were hoping there wasn’t quite as much drama involved at ours than in the soaps!' Paul (right) and Andy making it official inside the Rovers Return . After the ceremony the couple and guests enjoyed drinks on the cobbles and around the set . Paul and Andy, who live in Islington, London, asked about holding a wedding on the set after it became an official visitor attraction in April. Tour operator Continuum decided to get a marriage licence for the set after a number of other requests. Once they had the necessary permissions they went back to Paul and Andy to see if they wanted to become the first to marry there - and there are already two more weddings planned before the site is set to close in October. Andy and Paul, who have been a couple for 12 years, were joined by friends from across the UK for the civil ceremony on Monday evening. And they admitted that at first their friends thought they were joking about the location. The couple take a seat at the street's famous bus stop (left) and the grooms and their guests mock-up a scene from their favourite soap in the Platt's front lounge (right) Paul (left) places a ring on Andy's finger behind the bar . And when Paul went to register their wedding, even the registrar didn’t believe him. He laughs: 'When I said we were getting married at the Rovers Return on Coronation Street there was a raised eyebrow. 'Then when I told them that the Manchester registry office is on Albert Square I think they thought I was really taking the mick,' Paul says referring to the address of the Manchester Register Office, which happens to have a soap-related link. 'They said ""you’ll be telling us the reception is at the Woolpack next""!' adds Paul. The newlyweds excitedly posed for their wedding pics up and down the cobbled street, and reminisced about their favourite soap weddings over the years. Paul said: 'I absolutely loved the wedding of Karen and Steve McDonald, where Tracy Barlow arrives, reveals she’s pregnant, and it all kicked off with a stiletto.' Andy added: 'Mine would be when Becky McDonald got too drunk to get married - but we’re not planning that to happen today!' Cheers!

"Terry and Lyndsay Walker, owners of Metro Salvage and stars of BBC1 Scrappers, have been together for 35 years . The rags-to-riches couple who starred in the BBC1 documentary Scrappers have told of their surprise at the level of attention they have reached after the series aired. Terry and Lyndsay Walker, who have been together for 35 years after meeting at a school open day aged 11, were scouted for the six-part series after Terry uploaded some funny YouTube videos of staff at their scrap metal empire Metro Salvage. Friday night saw the final episode in . the six-part series which charted the ups and downs of the company based in Bolton, Greater Manchester. After the first show aired, the couple left their home in Radcliffe to spend three weeks soaking up the sun at their townhouse in Murcia, Spain. On their . return, they were surprised to discover their new-found fame meant the . weekly shop at Asda took more than three hours thanks to people wanting . to stop and chat. 'I'm really surprised about the response - we're just ordinary people in everyday life. It's part of our life, it's normal to us,' says Lyndsay. 'It's been quite a good reaction on Twitter. There's only me that's . been slated - people saying, ""Has she no class drinking red wine with . ice?"", calling my hats and saying she's a gold digger. Yeah right! But I'm not bothered, I know myself.' Lyndsay says of deciding to do the show, which drew almost three million viewers: 'Terry said it was a bit of . advertising. But we didn't get paid and it was really hard work. 'It was intense, especially not getting paid for it, and they were stopping us from earning money. The 49-year-old adds: 'TV people were talking about doing a second one. A lot of people are asking about it.' Viewers of the show have been fascinated by the ups and downs of the couples enduring relationship, including the many heated arguments about Terry's addiction to spending their money at car auctions. After meeting at Sharples school almost 40 years ago the couple, both 49, are now married with three children and will celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary in October. Terry says: 'I was at that school for 12 months and then I got whisked away, I ended up in a children's home. But, to be honest, I was thankful for that. When they came to pick me up, I was relieved. I wasn't getting any attention. I was doing things wrong but my parents weren't putting me in my place. 'It ended up where I didn't go to school and was getting in trouble.' Terry and Lyndsay Walker's wedding in 1984 (left) and the couple dating in their younger years (right) After two years at a children's home in Blackburn, Terry returned to school in year nine and started dating Lyndsay, before leaving at the age of 14 to work in his father's scrap yard. Terry and Lyndsay married aged 19 and Mrs Walker fell pregnant later that year with daughter Jemma, who is now 29 and works in the accounts department of Metro Salvage. The pair also have son Jon, aged 23, . who is car sales manager at Metro Salvage, and daughter Cathy, a mobile . hairdresser, aged 26. Cathy was born extremely premature at 24 weeks, . weighing just over 1lb. Doctors said she would not survive, but says . Lyndsay: 'We never felt that she wouldn't.' 'She . was in hospital for three months, in the Princess Anne special baby . unit. Terry always calls her our miracle child,' she adds. The rags-to-riches couple who starred in the BBC1 documentary Scrappers have told how they met aged just 11 and became childhood sweethearts . Terry started his own business while Lyndsay was pregnant with Jemma after being refused a pay rise at his family firm. The father-to-be bought himself a van and rented yards in Farnworth and Radcliffe before raising £250,000 to buy the current site in 1992. Thanks to years of hard graft that the couple now enjoy a luxurious lifestyle at their five-bedroom detached house in Radcliffe when they are not putting long shifts in at the yard. Asked if he ever thought he would one day be the boss of the North West's biggest scrap metal yard, employing more than 30 staff, Terry says: 'I always knew - I'm only being truthful. 'I was well-liked and well-known all over the North West. I get on with everybody. But being the boss has its ups and downs. 'I love the job, when the job's good, it's brilliant. But the weather is against us sometimes so it gets you a little bit down. 'Sometimes things don't run just as you'd like them to but that's just because the kids in here are still learning. Hopefully, one day, they'll get what's going on and how I work and once they adhere to that the job will be right.'","Terry and Lyndsay Walker, both aged 49, have been together for 35 years .

"On the outside, this mother-of-five seems like a beautiful, confident woman, but beneath her clothes is a hidden secret that's tormented her for over a decade. Pam's unsightly varicose veins, which she describes as 'worms beneath my skin', crushed her confidence and gave her crippling insecurities, which meant she couldn't even undress in front of her own husband. Tonight, on My Naked Secret, a documentary on TLC, Pam bravely unveils her unsightly legs and undergoes drastic treatment to rid her of her decade-long burden. Scroll down for video . Pam (left) tells of her humiliation after developing unsightly condition (right) 'I could never love my body as it is now,' she says as she shows her legs for the first time. 'But other people don't know what I'm hiding underneath my clothes.' 'It stops me doing activities with children and I feel I don't look good enough for my husband. 'I'm so tired of hiding. If I have to hide anymore I'm going to completely shut down. 'When I look in the mirror I feel really upset,' she admits on the documentary. 'My clothes are a safety net. I feel off guard when I take my clothes off. 'My problem is on my right leg - I've got really bad varicose veins,' she says bravely unveiling them. 'They start on the top of my thigh and finish at the top of my feet. It's really hard to look at myself in the mirror because my leg doesn't look normal. 'It feels like I've got worms in my leg,' she says referring to the wiggly protrusions that run along the back of her calf and thigh. Before (left) and after (right), Pam's legs are transformed . 'It's like they've taken over my life - they've taken over my body' she says. Varicose veins affects over 30% of adults and are more common in women. Pregnancy, weight gain, old age and a family history also increase their likelihood. The unsightly and often painful condition develops when valves in the veins stop working properly causing blood to pool in the veins, which can make them swell and enlarge. 'They bulge out, they feel painful, they feel itchy and they feel like they are tearing up my skin,' says Pam. 'I'd feel very embarrassed if anyone saw them - they'd think I'm not normal. 'I know that myself but hearing it from other people would be worse,' she says fighting back tears. 'I just want a normal leg. I just want to be normal like everyone else.' Pam has always taken pride in her appearance so she was devastated when at aged 27 unsightly blue and purple bulges started to appear. 'They started after I had my third child, then after my fourth they became more visible. After my fifth, my leg looked gross. 'I went to the doctor who diagnosed varicose veins and gave me stockings and ibuprofen gel, but it didn't work. 'I dress around my problem by wearing long trousers and leggings,' says Pam.  'I wish I could wear a dress that would make me feel really confident in myself.' 'I rather there's no one in the room when I get changed and at night it's easier to just shut the lights off,' she continues. Her self-esteem also has repercussions on her marriage. 'It affects my relationship with my husband. Although he won't say it I know he's probably thinking, ""I wish I didn't have to feel those lumps on your leg."" 'It makes me upset because for years I just wish that my leg was normal. I'm at that point I'm ready to try anything.' On consultation with a surgeon, Pam find out she needs three different types of surgery, without which her veins could become a serious health hazard. Consultant surgeon Professor Mark Whitely, explains, 'You have quite a strange pattern of veins. None of them are coming from the leg - they are all coming from the pelvis. If you don't remove them you could end up getting a leg ulcer and clots, which can lead to infection and in rare cases blood poisoning. 'Pam needs the veins in her pelvis removed then two different procedures to remove the veins in her legs - the laser threatment and then injections.' Also on hand to help Pam restore her self-esteem is psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos. 'Pam has been hiding this issue for a decade. Is she going to take control - not just practically but emotionally too?' she questions. Dr Papadopoulos gets Pam to open up about her past: 'I've got two sister and four brothers - I'm the oldest, which adds a lot of responsibility. I had to be a role model. I had to grow up quickly.' 'I had first child at 19, it was absolutely wonderful being mum - being a role model. I don't like to talk to close relatives because I'm afraid of their reaction. Pam had to undergo a series of three treatments to rid herself of her veins . 'I look after myself and want to look good for my husband - I feel ashamed.' 'It's as if you need to be perfect.' says Dr Papadopoulos. 'Let's focus on getting you to love all of you - letting go of your shame.' 'You're focusing on one thing. You think it's ugly but if you stop focusing you'll start being able to see yourself.' Despite never having had surgery before Pam decides to go ahead with the drastic series of treatments. Dr Tony Lopez, performs Pam's pelvic coil embolisation. 'I have to access the faulty veins and close them off completely. The pelvic veins are accessed via Pam's neck, through her heart, abdomonial cavity and then into the pelvis. Metal coils are inserted so they no longer fill with blood.' The procedure takes one hour and Pam goes home later that day. The surgery on her leg veins happens in two parts and involves two-hour sessions using local anesthetic . The first procedure is endovenous lazer ablation and a phlebectomy where the veins are removed through incisions in the leg using a tiny hook. Next Pam has foam schlerotherapy, where a special substance is injected into the veins, which forces the forces blood out of veins and kills them. For two weeks Pam has to wear compression bandages and is told to expect the heeling process to take three months. But just seven weeks later, Pam is overwhelmed by the results of her series of treatments. 'Look at me!' she says twirling in a knee-length dress. 'I feel so much happier - I can wear dresses and skirts and not worry about how my legs look. 'I could never have worn something like this before. I'm just so impressed with the results. When I used to take my clothes off I used to be so uncomfortable looking at myself. 'Now I've got great looking legs I don't have pain and every opportunity I want to look in mirror! 'For ten years I've been trapped and now I can feel confidence wherever I am. I feel absolutely free. 'My relationship with my husband now is absolutely superb. He can see I'm happier person in myself and that makes him happy. 'I now look forward to the future and I'm feeling confident. It's a great feeling.'

"TV personality Kate Humble has revealed that she never wanted children but loves her large family of animals. The forty-five-year-old nature presenter has also admitted that one of her greatest pleasures in life is dancing with her husband - fully naked. 'I never ever wanted kids,' Kate said. Kate Humble with one of her many furry friends . But the presenter's home life is far from quiet, with a house full of pets. She has three dogs, assorted . chickens, ducks, geese, 10 ewes and lambs. On her 117-acre farm she keeps more sheep and chickens, ducks, geese, goats and two breeding sows, which she admits she agreed to buy when she was 'a little bit drunk'. 'We usually get up at 6am to feed the . animals, but people with children think that's a lie in. And, although . you can't really ignore your animals, they don't bounce on your bed like . children,' she joked. Kate moved to Monmouthshire seven years ago with her husband of 22 years, Ludo Graham, 53. 'I've fancied Ludo since I was 16,' she told The People, and admits that the couple love to indulge in a naked dance. 'There's something joyous about it, and I . urge everyone to try it,' she said. 'My husband and I danced naked . in the middle of the desert in Jordan once. 'If you can't get your kicks . in that incredibly innocent, joyful way, then the world is not a good . place. It's my eccentric, barking mad way of getting closer to nature.' Left: Kate with husband Ludo Graham; Right: In presenter mode for BBC2's 'Lambing Live' The presenter, whose next trip is to Siberia to live with reindeer herders at minus 40 degrees, said she doesn't expect to win best-dressed presenter any time soon and joked that the worst dressed gong is more likely to come her way. She also revealed that her and her TV producer husband often run out of clean clothes and with the outdoorsy nature of her job, they share some very unglamorous moments. Kate divulged that during one intimate moment on a recent wedding anniversary, her husband discovered that she'd caught fleas. She'd spent the day sitting on the forest floor and her back was covered in spots from the little critters. She also had spiders lay eggs in her toe after a trip to Africa. The presenter went to A&E after her toe became painful and it turned out there was a big egg sac growing in her foot. Given the wild nature of her work, Kate feels no pressure to keep up with ‘autocutie’ presenters and newsreaders. She's previously admitted: ‘I’ve never been a dressy sort of person. I’m not interested in clothes and fashion. 'You want to look reasonable, but most of the time the programmes I do are not about me. I am a conduit for information, nothing more. ‘If I was there in a dress that shows half my t*** and most of my a***, it would be pointless.’","The nature presenter reveals that children were never on the agenda .

They trail leaders and  Marseille, who demolished Stade de Reims 5-0, by three points. Lucas Moura and Marquinhos scored as PSG beat Caen to move second in Ligue 1 . Brazilian forward Moura celebrates scoring for the French champions against Caen . PSG, however, could face some attacking problems in the near future as Argentine forward Ezequiel Lavezzi was substituted by Jean-Christophe Bahebeck after only 10 minutes with a possible thigh injury. Laurent Blanc’s side, who had drawn their last three games in all competitions, were never threatened by Caen and took the early lead when Brazil forward Lucas dribbled past several players before firing past Remy Vercoutre in the 18th minute. Centre back Marquinhos made it 2-0 nine minutes into the second half with a downward header from Bahebeck’s corner kick. Centre-back Marquinhos also got on the score-sheet for the Parisian side . Monaco forward Valere Germain scored the only goal of the game as they beat Montpellier . Earlier, late substitute Valere Germain scored deep into injury time as Monaco continued to improve from a woeful start to the season with a 1-0 win at Montpellier. Forward Germain, who came on for Geoffrey Kondogbia in the 88th minute, found the back of the net three minutes into added time from Layvin Kurzawa’s cross. Leonardo Jardim’s side, without top forwards Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez after the Colombian duo left for Manchester United and Real Madrid respectively, are now 11th in the standings with 10 points from seven games.

"There's nothing more seductive than a juicy pair of pouting lips, so it's no wonder a survey found that 63 per cent of women would like to plump up their own pair. But despite our lust for luscious lips only 7 per cent of women said they had no qualms with lip fillers, 15 per cent were on the fence and 78 per cent of us gave it a big thumbs down due to potential trout pout, health risks and cost. The survey by leading beauty retailer Escentual.com questioned 1,000 women about their lip preferences. Scroll down for video . Fear of trout pout like Tulia's, pictured above leaving court last month, is the most common reason why women avoid having lip fillers . Despite lip injectables being popular among celebrities including Amy Childs and Katie Price, women are reticent to follow their lead. Well over half of women (60 per ecnt) said their main reason for steering clear of the cosmetic treatment was fear 'trout pout' - the wonky, disproportionate mouth that can sometimes result from the treatment. The latest celebrity victim of the 'trout pout' was Tulisa, who appeared swollen mouthed at her recent court appearance. The Only Way is Essex star Amy Childs (left) and Celebrity Big Brother contestant Lauren Goodger (right) were voted as having second and third worst lips respectively . Katie Price (left) and Lindsey Lohan (right) came fourth and fifth on the 'worst lips' list . Other reasons women gave for avoiding lip fillers were the potential health risks (29%) and the hefty costs of regular top-up injections (9 per cent). Injectable lip fillers – often made from collagen, hyaluronic acid or Alloderm - usually last from several weeks to up to four months before the plumping effects fade and the treatment has to be repeated. Rather than opting for surgery, over half of women (52 per cent) said they had tried make-up tricks to fake a fuller pout. Emma Leslie, editor at Escentual.com, said: 'It’s definitely possible to create the illusion of plumper looking lips without having to resort to injectables. 'Applying lip liner just outside your natural lip line in a shade close to or slightly darker than your lip colour works wonders. Finish off with a moisturising lip colour in a light or natural hue – darker lipsticks can sometimes make lips appear smaller than they are.' And the award for best lips goes to: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (left) and Angelina Jolie (right) In third and fourth place: Kylie Jenner (left) and Scarlett Johansson (right) 'Another great tip is to add a touch of pearlescent highlighter to the centre of your lips and Cupid’s bow. 'There are a range of highly effective products out there specifically targeted at creating fuller lips.' Some provide a natural plumping effect by feeding the delicate area around the mouth with nutrients, like DHC Revitalising Moisture Strips (£9.50 from Escentual.com). Others nourish the lips themselves, such as Smashbox O-Plump (£18 from Boots). Escentual.com also questioned women on the celebrities whose lips they most envied. Supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley came out on top, with newlywed Angelina Jolie – long famed for her full pout – close behind. Tulisa was voted celebrity with the least attractive lips, followed by Celebrity Big Brother contestant Lauren Goodger, who is also reported to have had lip injections. Unsurprisingly, nearly all of the women surveyed thought Tulisa was wrong to tamper with her lips – 96 per cent of women said she looked prettier before the fillers. Go forth and plump-ify!

"The mother of a pregnant teenager murdered by her abusive boyfriend has shared her harrowing story in the hope it will prevent future tragedies. Samantha Shrewsbury, mother of the late Jayden Parkinson, opened up on today's This Morning. The distraught mother, 47, told how she tried to protect Jayden from her abusive boyfriend, Ben Blakely, who killed the teenager in December last year. Scroll down for video . Loss: Jayden Parkinson, 17, left was murdered by her ex-boyfriend after finding out she was pregnant with his child. Her mother Samantha Shrewsbury appeared on This Morning today, right . The bereaved mother described how Blakely isolated her daughter from her family. She said: 'He took her away from everyone in the family – her sisters, brother, me, her dad. He used to cut up her SIM card and smash up her phone.' Blakely was abusive towards his girlfriend throughout their relationship. He would burn her with cigarettes, punch her and starve her. 'He was physically abusive from day one,' said Samantha. 'But . when she was living in the flat with him and his cousins he'd go . away for a couple of days to another girlfriend, have a roast dinner . there and come back and tell Jayden all about it.' 'At one point she hadn't eaten for four days. She rang Childline, they called the police and social services took her some food round because she hadn't eaten for that long,' she said. Trying to explain why her daughter stayed in the relationship, Samantha from Didcot, Oxfordshire, said: 'She was 17 and totally in love with him. I think she thought, ""I can change him"". 'I think also because of the threats towards towards our family – her nieces and nephews and me. She probably thought, ""If I stay away from the . family they'll be safe"".' The mother told of the great lengths she went to in an attempt to keep Jayden from her destructive  relationship, even locking her in the house. Fought for her child: Samantha tried to protect her pregnant daughter from her violent boyfriend, Ben Blakely . ‘She’d get out through windows,' she said. 'I sent her to her sister's for six weeks, but he would always find a way of getting to her - either by phone or he’d get a little note to her.' Eventually the distraught mum tried tough love, telling her daughter: 'It's either him or me'. But Jayden, who was living back at home at the time, still refused to finish the relationship and ended up moving to a hostel. ‘For two days she slept outside my front door. One of the hardest things I've ever had to do is to step over my daughter in the morning and carry on with what I wanted to do to prove a point.' But the ultimatum didn't work and Jayden refused to leave her violent lover. Remembering her beloved daughter, Samantha said: ‘She was quirky, funny, spontaneous - could be like any ordinary teenager, a pain in the backside. She hated me sometimes, loved me sometimes - but she was a good kid all in all.' Describing the first moment she laid eyes on Blakely, Shrewsbury recalls how he whistled at her daughter across the road and she immediately had a bad feeling about him. 'I said to Jayden, ""Urgh, who's he?"" and Jayden said, ""He's my friends brother – he's a rat anyway"".' Murderer: Ben Blakely, left, and a police tent in the Great Western Cemetery by All Saints' Church in Didcot where Jayden's body was found . When they first started dating Samantha thought the relationship wouldn't go anywhere, but when Jayden turned 16 things progressed. 'In the beginning I tried to let them both get on with it to see. But I warned him, ""You harm a hair on my daughter’s head you’ll rue the day you ever met my family."" And he said, ""I promise Mrs Shewsbury, I won't"". He came round and had a bacon sandwich with us and he seemed pretty genuine.' The concerned mother had heard Blakely had a bad reputation but wasn't sure what to believe. 'The stories I heard beforehand about him decapitating a cat all seemed pretty farcical – although it came out in court that they were true,' she said. Jayden finally plucked up the courage to . end the relationship in November last year, with Blakeley threatening to . pose intimate photographs online to ""humiliate"" her. But shortly afterwards she found out she was pregnant. On 3 December 2013, a few days after telling Blakely she was carrying his baby, the teenager was murdered. Her body was later found on 18 . December, buried in Ben's uncle's grave. Fighting back the tears, the heartbroken mother described the days leading up to her daughter's brutal murder. Grieving: Samantha couldn't hold back the tears on ITV's This Morning . 'She was scared,' she said of her daughter discovering she was pregnant. 'She was crying . on the phone and didn’t know what to do. I arranged to meat on the . Tuesday – that fateful day – to discuss her options. 'I gave her the three . options - adoption, abortion or keeping it. I explained through each option . and there was no other choice for her but to keep the baby. 'She would have been a brilliant mum - she loved kids, she loved her nieces and nephews dearly. 'I said my goodbyes to her and arranged to met her that Friday to go Christmas shopping and to get maternity clothes. 'She was still living in a hostel and didn't want to come back – she didn't want to bring any more drama to anybody's home. That was the last time I saw my daughter.' In June this year, Blakely was . sentenced to life with a minimum term of 20 years and Samantha attended everyday of the trial and witnessed every traumatic testimony. 'I did it for my daughter. No matter how harrowing, I needed to know all that – I didn't want my mind to make it up. At some point I'm going to do the walk to where they murdered her – but not just yet. I'm not ready.' She added how disappointed she was with the sentence. 'I was wanting 30 years but he got a minimum of 15, then eight for perverting the course of justice. Then he had three years knocked off for being ""nice"",' she said ironically. 'He's got a life now – he has three meals a day. I've lost my daughter, I've lost my grandchild, I've lost a big part of my future and our families future. 'It does make me angry that when he's 42 he could be free. Although it doesn’t mean that when he goes for parole he’s going to get it. I will fight my damnedest for him not to to.' The brave mother has now launched charity Jayden's Gift, to help 16-18 year-old's who might find themselves in trouble, but not have access to social services. She hopes to sponsor houses for teenagers in need to help them through college and to set up mentoring programmes. 'Rest in peace Jayden, but I will never forgive,' said the heartbroken mother. 'There will never be any forgiveness from my family - ever.'","Jayden Parkinson was murdered by boyfriend Ben Blakely .

"The X Factor's search for the next 'big thing' commenced this weekend, but the judges need look no further than Simon Cowell's face, which is possibly the biggest thing on the show. Of late, the new dad's face seems to have inflated somewhat. The difference between Simon's appearance now and when he first appeared on the X Factor in 2002 is startling. So what might be causing this puffiness? 'Let's be frank. The first and most obvious factor is that he’s put on weight. He’s aged, he's over 50 and it shows,' says Harley Street cosmetic doctor Dr Dan Dhunna. Although admittedly, at 55, the music mogul is looking pretty good. Scroll down for video . Left: Simon slim-faced in 1985; Right: Looking puffy-faced in 2012 . ‘I’ve met Simon several times - backstage at X Factor a few years ago and at charity events - and, gosh, his face has really changed since then.' But are there are other factors that have caused this mega transformation from the slim-faced Simon who dated Sanita back in the eighties to the puffy version we see on our screens today? 'It looks like he's had fillers in the cheek area to . try and improve the contours and lift the lower face but as a result he looks a . little unnatural and too cheeky,' says Dr Dhunna. The changing face of Simon: in the eighties (left) and in 2001 (right) He may not have change his T-shirt but he does change his face: in 2002 (left) and 2003 (right) 'In my opInion some . celebrities, like Melanie Griffiths and Madonna, have over-filled their faces in the cheek area and I think he's fallen into that trap,' he continues. 'Men generally have flat faces with only a little bit of a cheek bone. Unfortunately some cosmetic doctors don’t understand . the artistics between male and female face and they inflate the male . face like it's a woman's. 'So you get these round cheeks like Simon's, which doesn’t work on a . man because it looks abnormal,' he adds. It's no secret that Simon has a penchant for Botox. During an interview with newsreader Emily Maitlis, published in the Radio Times last year he said of his lifestyle, ‘I work out three or four times a week, I have Botox, take tons of vitamins and vitamin infusions.’ Dr Dhunna also points out that Simon's large head is caught in a vicious cycle. 'He’s been very vocal about having Botox . treatment but the problem is, if you have treatment over time, the forehead maintains smoothness but the rest of the face loosens, which can look quite odd in comparison. This perpetuates the need for fillers in the cheek area.' The widening face of Simon: in 2004 (left) and 2005 (right) Same outfit, different year: in 2008 (left) and 2010 (right) According to Dr Dhunna, Simon's sun . habit also means he's more likely to keep needing fillers. 'You always . see pictures of Simon on his jet ski in Barbados but all that sun . exposure is robbing the skin of collagen and elastin, which makes it . loser . so the tissues sag more. So when you try to improve that with fillers, . the cycle continues.' Medical aesthetic doctor, Dr Carolyn Berry adds that there are many other factors that can cause a puffy face, known in medical terms as a 'moon face'. 'Alcohol, steroid treatment, and lifestyle choices can all be a factor. People take steroids for all sorts of reasons from asthma to atheritis. But there are other medications that can also cause the face to flare up,' she says. A smiling Simon: in 2011 (left) and 2012 (right) The latest inflation: in 2013 (left) and this weekend (right) 'In Simon's case it's most likely to be a combination of lifestyle choices and problems with the aesthetic treatment he's had. Maybe he's had Botox too close to filming and it hasn't settled down,' continues Dr Berry. 'If you think about Simon’s lifestyle, he's admitted before that he doesn’t sleep well and if he isn't getting a decent night's sleep that could contribute to a bloated appearance,' adds Dr Berry. When he appeared on Piers Morgan's Life Stories a few year ago, the 55-year-old admitted, 'Almost every night I will be working until four or five in the morning...I take sleeping pills almost every night because I freak out at the thought that I can't sleep. The more I think about it, the more it bothers me.' And with a new baby in his life, Simon's sleeping regime is likely to have further deteriorated. Well if this season's talent isn't engaging enough, at least there is something to keep us transfixed by the X Factor - the enigma that is Simon Cowell's inflatable head.","Simon's large head took centre stage on this week's X Factor .

"The life of a football WAG has its perks, from showbiz parties to designer clothes. So perhaps it’s not surprising that some women go to great lengths to win players’ attention – even outside of the glamorous Premier League. Kerry Miller’s bizarre attempts to get noticed included barging into the team’s dressing room and sending them scantily clad photos of herself, a tribunal heard. Accusations: Kerry Miller, pictured outside Leicester Tribunal Court, is accusing Burton Albion FC of constructive dismissal, sexual harassment and discrimination at an employment tribunal . The office worker at League Two  football club Burton Albion claims she was forced to quit her job by bosses. But . the club accuses the 45-year-old of bursting into the dressing room on . at least 15 occasions while players were getting changed and showering. She took on extra jobs to get in contact with players and sent them . photographs of herself in her underwear, Leicester Employment Tribunal . heard. The mother-of-one, who had an affair with a player in his 20s . and sent half-naked pictures to at least one other, worked in sales and . support at Pirelli Stadium, in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, for two . years until she left in February last year. Club chairman Ben . Robinson told the tribunal that mobile phone  pictures of Miss Miller in . ‘various stages of undress’ were circulated among the team. Kerry Miller admitted having a 'casual' relationship with defender Ryan Austin, pictured left, and sending 'private' pictures of herself to striker Billy Kee, pictured right . Kerry Miller is alleged to have burst in unannounced at least 15 times while players were undressing . He . learned of the photos after two players – striker Calvin Zola, 31, who . now plays for Aberdeen, and defender Zander Diamond, 28 – complained . about her barging in on players in September 2012. Mr Robinson said: . ‘The complaint was about Kerry’s conduct with regards to the number of . times she was coming into the players’ dressing room while they were . taking showers and partially dressed. ‘The players as a group would joke that any minute now Kerry would walk through the doors,’ he said. The widow admitted sending  ‘private’ pictures to 23-year-old striker Billy Kee, who then showed them to his team-mates. She told the panel: ‘The Billy Kee incident was an isolated mistake and I held my hands up and said I made a mistake. ‘I . asked him to delete the photos and he said he would, but instead showed . them to other players. He is not the brightest boy in the world and I . wanted him to do what I asked [by deleting the photos], I didn’t want . people knowing he had photos of me. I told him it could cost me my job.’ All white: Miller, pictured in a bikini, has appeared at a tribunal claiming constructive dismissal . Miss Miller, whose husband died 18 months before she started work . at the club, also admitted she had a ‘casual’ relationship with defender . Ryan Austin, 29, who now plays for Brackley Town. She later described a . new player as her ‘next conquest’ the tribunal heard. She allegedly set . her sights on goalkeeper and model Stuart Tomlinson, who she thought . was ‘fit’. She was pictured holding a modelling snap of him, ‘looking happy with herself’, the panel heard. A photo of the pair was posted on Facebook during a night out while the player was off work recovering from an injury. Sarah George, for Burton Albion, said: ‘This picture might have been seen by sponsors and supporters. ‘When . you went into work the following week the club manager, Fleur Robinson, . says she told you any relationship which affects the club would be . frowned upon. This is the sort of thing which could bring the club into . disrepute.’ Miss Miller denied having designs on the goalie and stressed they were not in a relationship. Miss . Miller, who lives in a £400,000 house in Marchington, Staffordshire, . with her daughter, denied claims she burst into the players’ dressing . room unannounced. Claims: Ben Robinson, chairman of Burton Albion Football Club (left) and player Billy Kee (right) Burton Albion players celebrating beating Middlesbrough 2-1 in January 2011 . Kerry Miller was based at the Pirelli Stadium in Burton upon Trent when she worked for the League Two club . She said she entered the changing room on only four occasions, and knocked and shouted each time. The tribunal heard she went nightclubbing with another Burton Albion player and posted Facebook photos of them together. The . club, which denies unfair treatment, says Miss Miller took on jobs . cooking and serving food in addition to her full-time role to get direct . contact with players. Mr Robinson allegedly asked her to stop . serving meals, telling her to ‘concentrate on your job’. But Miss . Miller, who started work at the club in September 2011, says she was . forced to quit and is claiming constructive dismissal, sexual . discrimination and harassment. She said: ‘I was good at what I did. I . loved my job, I was not going to let Ben [the chairman], who wasn’t . there most of the time, stop me doing something I loved.’ Miss . Miller, who describes herself on Facebook as a self-employed beauty . worker, said she offered  to cook as a favour because the  chef was not . coming in. Mr Robinson shouted at her for it, she said, adding: ‘I was . upset and humiliated . . . which is why I later left.’ She claimed . Mr Robinson called her ‘attractive’ and asked if she was ‘seeking a . husband’ during her job interview. Mr Robinson said she got the job on . the recommendation of her mother, Carol Richards, who also works at the . club. He added: ‘I categorically deny I made any reference to Kerry seeking a husband at Burton Albion.’ Mrs Richards said she believed Mr Robinson had ‘a soft spot’ for her daughter.

He has been charged with three counts of second-degree sexual assault and one count of second-degree endangering the welfare of a child. Charged: Nolan Johnson, 39, a teacher at The Hun School of Princeton, was arrested and charged with three counts of second-degree sexual assault and one count of second-degree endangering the welfare of a child . Hun School officials contacted Princeton Police earlier this month after receiving information about the alleged abuses on the girl. Nolan allegedly engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior with the 16 year-old female victim on multiple occasions between June and July while he was the victim's teacher. The incidents apparently occurred both on and off campus. The charges were a result of an ongoing investigation between Princeton Police detectives and Mercer County Prosecutor's Office detectives. 'We find Mr. Johnson's actions, as described by police, deplorable and we are saddened by their inevitable impact,' Hun Headmaster Jonathan Brougham said in a written statement.

"It may be meant as friendly advice, but telling someone they are piling on the pounds just makes them delve further into the biscuit tin. Those who are made to feel ashamed about their size are six times as likely to become obese, a study has found. Experts say that being criticised for their weight drives those who are already sensitive about it to comfort eat. Fear of ridicule may also mean they avoid exercise. Scroll down for video . Those who are made to feel ashamed about their size are 'six times as likely to become obese' (file picture) Researchers from University College London said that the obesity crisis could be eased by teaching people – including doctors – that it is counterproductive to discriminate against others because they are overweight. They said that public health campaigns should also avoid making people feel bad about their weight. Lead author Sarah Jackson advises medics to avoid using the word ‘fat’ where possible and replace it with the terms overweight or obese. The study involved almost 3,000 English men and women aged 50-plus who were weighed twice, four years apart. They were also asked if they had been discriminated against because of their weight. Examples of this included being treated with disrespect – including being the butt of jokes – receiving poorer service in shops, restaurants, hospitals and doctors’ surgeries, being threatened and being assumed to be stupid. Researchers from University College London said that the obesity crisis could be eased by teaching people that it is counterproductive to discriminate against others because they are overweight (file picture) Some 5 per cent said they had been treated differently because of their weight – with the figure rising to 36 per cent among those who were the most overweight. The study, published in the journal Obesity, found that those who were victims of ‘fat shaming’ put on just over 2lb on average over the course of the study. They were also six times as likely to become obese. In contrast, those who were not criticised for their weight actually became slimmer, albeit by a small amount. Dr Jackson said: ‘Our results show that weight discrimination does not encourage weight loss and suggest that it may even exacerbate weight gain. ‘Previous studies have shown that people who experience discrimination report comfort eating. The study found that those who were victims of ‘fat shaming’ - such as in shops, restaurants (file picture) and hospitals - put on just over 2lb on average over the course of the study . Stress responses to discrimination can increase appetite, particularly for unhealthy, energy-dense food. Weight discrimination has also been shown to make people feel less confident about taking part in physical activity, so they tend to avoid it. People may not feel comfortable going to the gym if they think they are being judged because of their weight.’ Previous research has shown that it is not just the general public who are guilty of making the overweight feel ashamed of their size. Dr Jackson said: ‘Studies have shown that quite a wide range of health professionals hold negative attitudes about obese people and patients pick up on that bias. ‘Doctors tend to spend less time with obese patients. They feel that treating obesity is a futile task and many avoid doing it. ‘We need to find a way of addressing this during training, highlighting that blaming and shaming isn’t going to help resolve the problem.’ University College London Professor Jane Wardle said: ‘Our study clearly shows that weight discrimination is part of the obesity problem and not the solution.’ Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘If you are aggressive with the way you put the message across and denigrate and tease, you are not going to get anywhere at all. What you need is tough love.’ He suggested that instead of talking about fat, medics should warn about the consequences of obesity, such as risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes – blindness, amputation and early death. In 2008, the word ‘obese’ was banned on official letters to parents of overweight children. ‘It was replaced by the term ‘very overweight’ on warning letters sent out as part of a national child measurement programme.","Those made to feel ashamed of size are 'six times as likely to become obese'

"A quick-thinking Texas police officer ended up saving countless lives after he managed to bring a driver who was heading the wrong way down the interstate to a halt. Shenandoah police Seargent Gary Sharpen began zig-zagging across the four lane road in an attempt to alert an allegedly 'drugged-up' driver who was approaching speeds close to 100 mph. Sgt. Sharpen positioned his patrol vehicle against the traffic on Friday night, and incredibly, his plan worked. Scroll down for video... A quick-thinking, local police officer protected a string of drivers from a car going the wrong way on the highway . Shenandoah police Sgt. Gary Sharpen started zig-zagging back and fourth on Interstate 45 northbound when deputies called saying there was a driver headed the wrong way against traffic . Caught: Jose Luis Alejo-Zavalija, 25,was later stopped and arrested. Police said he was believed to be under the influence of drugs . In the line of fire: Sharpen positioned his patrol SUV between the stopped traffic and the PT Cruiser that was reaching speeds of 100 mph . As the PT Cruiser that was being driven by 25-year-old Jose Luis Alejo-Zavalija approached him, the man slammed on the brakes. Sharpen positioned his patrol SUV between the traffic which had been halted and the PT Cruiser. 'I knew he was coming at me and I knew there was no shoulder on the freeway,' Sharpen said. 'I knew that the traffic behind me, those people in those cars, their lives were at risk. I had to do something to protect them. I kind of put my vehicle in the lane that he was going to be at and accelerated and came to a stop at about a 45 degree angle. And I heard the car and the tires squeal from him braking.'

"Bo Pelini, the longtime coach of college football team the Nebraska Cornhuskers, flared up about the widespread use of marijuana across the US on Friday. The 46-year-old, who as head coach earns a yearly salary of $2.875 million, said the drug is no longer contained to high schools and colleges but is an issue affecting everyone. 'It is out of control,' he said at the Big Red Breakfast, according to Omaha.com. 'Let’s face it, it’s not OK.' Outspoken: Nebraska Cornhuskers head coach Bo Pelini said in an interview Friday that the US has a serious issue with marijuana, and that today's youths are receiving 'bad information' about its dangers. Pelini said he believes his generation were more aware about the dangers marijuana. 'I think everybody that’s our age, my age, hopefully understands that it’s not OK,' he said. 'It’s not good. It’s not good for you. 'And these kids do it on a daily basis and a yearly basis ... and it’s a real problem out there.' Pelini said today's youth are not educated enough about the associated dangers. 'I think it’s something in society we need to get fixed ... but unfortunately they get bad information.' Pelini's brother, Carl, resigned from his position as Florida Atlantic head coach last October amid allegations of both marijuana and cocaine use, Sports Illustrated reported. However Pelini defended his sibling, saying that was not the reason for his departure. This week Pelini was also sure to stand by his own team, where he claims there is no issue with marijuana. Marijuana possession has been decriminalized in Nebraska. 'Fortunately for us it is not (an issue) in our program,' he said. 'But I can tell you around college football and college athletics ... serious in college. 'I guarantee you walk into dorms nowadays and it is a horrible problem.' Widespread: Data released in July by the NCAA showed that 24 percent of college football players reported using marijuana . The NCAA reduced the penalty for an athlete testing positive for marijuana from one year to half a year in April. In July it was revealed that 24 percent of college football players reported using marijuana, according to NCAA data. Then this summer, Nick Marshall, quarterback for the Auburn Tigers, was cited for marijuana possession. He has since been removed from the teams season opener against Arkansas, Sports Illustrated reported.","Nebraska Cornhuskers coach Bo Pelini said marijuana is now an issue affecting in everyone .

"It is often dismissed as part and parcel of growing up. But being picked on by your brother or sister can create deep mental scars, experts have warned. A study found that those who were regularly bullied by a sibling when a child were more likely to be clinically depressed or take an overdose in their late teens. The British researchers said that bullying at home is a ‘hidden problem’ – and one that victims find hard to escape. A study led by Oxford University found those who were regularly bullied by a sibling were more likely to be depressed or take an overdose in their teens (stoke image) They said parents must be aware that the phenomenon isn’t confined to the playground. Some 3,500 children aged 12 were asked if they had been bullied by sibling and, if so, how often it happened. Bullying involved more than simple teasing. The definition included deliberate nasty and hurtful remarks and being ignored and ostracised, as well as being kicked and pushed and being the subject of rumours and lies. Six years later, aged 18, the same youngsters answered questions about their feelings. They were also asked if they had ever self-harmed by taking an overdose or cutting themselves. Almost 800 said they had been bullied several times a week when young. These young men and women were twice as likely as those to be clinically depressed as young adults as those who hadn’t been tormented by a sibling. They were also twice as likely to say they had self-harmed within the previous year compared with those who had not been bullied. If the figures were extrapolated, sibling bullying could account for 13 per cent of depression and 19 per cent of self-harm among 18-year-olds, the journal Pediatrics reports. The study also found girls more likely to be victims than boys – with big brothers often the perpetrators. The study found big brothers were often the perpetrators and girls were most likely to be victims (stock image) Lead author Dr Lucy Bowes, from the University of Oxford, said: ‘Forms of bullying where victims are shoved around the playground or targeted at work have been well documented, however, this study uncovers a largely hidden form of bullying. ‘Victims of sibling bullying are offered little escape as sibling relationships endure throughout development. ‘We are not talking about the sort of teasing that often goes on within families, but incidents that occur several times a week, in which victims are ignored by their brothers or sisters, or are subjected to verbal or physical violence.’ Co-author Professor Dieter Wolke, of the University of Warwick, said: ‘It is important that parents set clear rules about what is allowed in conflicts and they should intervene consistently when their children maltreat each other repeatedly.’ Emma Jane Cross, chief executive of charity BeatBullying said: ‘Being bullied as a child can have a devastating effect which lasts a lifetime. ‘Parents who are concerned about this issue should speak to their children as early as possible before the problem escalates. ‘It's important to tackle the underlying issues behind more frequent bullying behaviour rather than dismissing it as normal sibling rivalry.’","Being picked on by your brother or sister can create deep mental scars .

"British Airways has cancelled all flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone as the Ebola outbreak sweeps through West Africa. It said it had been forced to protect staff and passengers amid a ‘deteriorating public health situation’. The news comes as it emerged that a Briton has quarantined themselves at home over fears they may have been exposed to the deadly virus in West Africa. Flight ban: British Airways has cancelled all flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone as the Ebola outbreak sweeps through West Africa. So far nearly 900 people have died in the most-deadly outbreak of the virus yet . The unnamed Cardiff resident is being monitored by doctors and is voluntarily staying away from work and keeping contact with others to a minimum. The disease has claimed almost 900 lives since February in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria in the world’s worst outbreak. The World Health Organisation warns it is out of control. BA airline flies four times a week from London to Freetown in Sierra Leone and on to Monrovia in Liberia. Its decision to cancel flights came amid growing fears over whether the epidemic could spread to Britain. The only other airline to stop any flights is Emirates, which has suspended its service to Conakry in Guinea. Experts questioned BA’s move yesterday, and said that with up to 750 BA passengers due to fly back to Heathrow on the route each week, it is feared that hundreds could be stranded. BA said it was trying to get customers on alternative flights out of the cities. It added: ‘We have suspended our flights to and from Liberia and Sierra Leone until August 31 due to the deteriorating public health situation. The safety of our customers, crew and ground teams is always our top priority and we will keep the routes under constant review.’ But microbiologist Professor Hugh Pennington said: ‘It doesn’t sound like very good planning to me if they are leaving people stranded who want to leave. They should have brought them out.’ He described the move as ‘75 per cent over-reaction’, adding: ‘I can see why they did it from a PR point of view but from a virological point of view, it is probably not necessary. ‘The big fact about Ebola is that it’s not that easy to catch. ‘I am not surprised, but slightly disappointed they have taken that step.’ However, another expert said the decision would cut the odds of the disease, which kills up to 90 per cent of victims, from being brought into Britain. Dr Derek Gatherer, of Lancaster University, said sharing a plane with an Ebola sufferer was ‘extremely dangerous’. He added: ‘It is more than possible that other people on the plane will become infected.’ Public Health Wales, which runs health services in the region, said the suspected patient in Cardiff did not have symptoms and there were no cases in Wales, adding: ‘We are alert to the possibility of cases in the UK and we remain vigilant to unexplained illness in people who have travelled from West Africa.’ People in Monrovia, Liberia, give a wide berth to the body of a man they suspect has died from the Ebola virus . A spokesman said people cannot be tested for the virus before the onset of symptoms, which take up to 21 days to appear. He added that the individual has been under surveillance for a week and ‘seems well’. Meanwhile, infected American aid worker Nancy Writebol was flown back to Atlanta for treatment yesterday after contracting the disease in Liberia. She follows her colleague Dr Kent Brantly, who returned for treatment on Saturday. Both are said to be making progress. Ebola victims suffer severe bleeding, fever, vomiting and diarrhoea. There is no cure.","Cardiff resident is voluntarily staying off work over fears of the deadly virus .

"Capsules: Calamari Gold is made from squid caught for sale in shops and restaurants . Hated by generations of children, it took being put into a capsule to make cod liver oil palatable, but even that might not be enough to save it. It is facing a challenge from squid oil, which is said to be much higher in health-boosting properties. Calamari Gold is made from squid caught for sale in shops and restaurants, and contains high levels of omega-3. It is particularly rich in a form of the essential fatty acid called DHA, which is good for our brain, eyes and heart. Capsule for capsule, the product is claimed to contain up to four times as much DHA as cod liver oil. ‘DHA is the predominant omega-3 in many of our vital organs and is fundamental for our health,’ said nutritionist Suzie Sawyer. ‘DHA is important for brain health, improving concentration, memory and cognitive development. ‘It is critical in the maintenance of overall eye health and research indicates it can help to improve blood pressure and may reduce the risk of heart disease.’ Unlike cod, squid is not overfished, and its relatively short lifespan means it accumulates fewer toxins than some other fish. The NHS recommends that we eat fish twice . a week, but many of us would rather pop a pill – the latest figures . show that Britons spend almost £10million a year on omega-3 supplements. Miss Sawyer said: ‘With rising costs . of seafood, the supplement is the more economical option to eating the . recommended two portions of food a week and a great alternative for . those who dislike seafood.’ A . month’s supply of 30, 1,000mg Calamari Gold capsules costs £34.99 from .

"Working class Britons are twice as likely to resort to diet pills as those in richer areas. The Sheffield University research showed that while the middle-classes sign up for Weight Watchers, Slimming World and other slimming clubs, those in more deprived areas put their faith in pills and potions. These include prescription drugs, herbal remedies and meal replacement drinks. The class divide surprised the researchers who speculated that those who are less well off may be more tempted by the promise of a quick fix. When it comes to diets, wealthier people opt for slimming clubs, while poorer people down diet pills. Actress Patsy Kensit and Sarah Ferguson (right) have both attended Weight Watchers in the past . Popping a pill may also work out cheaper than paying for week after week of classes. Researcher Dr Clare Relton said: ‘I think one obvious possible reason is that it is sometimes cheaper and quicker to take a pill, or supplement, to help in weight management. ‘Slimming clubs could be more expensive and people would have to follow weight management strategy over a period of time, rather than just say taking a pill. ‘You have to get to a slimming class, spend some time there, pay your £4 or £5, go back home and try to adjust every meal you eat. ‘Whereas, buying something over the counter is something you do perhaps once a month and is quicker in the long-term. ‘Also, we are a very much a pill taking society. It is staggering the amount of pills we take, with the average person taking two a day, for some reason or another.’ More than half of the 26,000 people from South Yorkshire surveyed by Dr Relton were overweight and almost one in five was obese. Rates of obesity were highest in deprived areas and among the elderly. The most common techniques used to lose weight were eating healthily, cutting back on portions and exercising more. Those living least well off areas shunned these methods were particularly likely to take weight loss pills, supplements and shakes. Less well off people may be more tempted by the promise of a quick fix from a pill, experts say . Some four per cent used these ‘quick fixes’, compared to just two per cent of the more affluent slimmers. The study also showed that men were more likely to be overweight – 44 per cent compared with just 31 per cent of the women questioned. Despite this, the men were less worried about their weight. Dr Relton added that our loved of pre-prepared, plastic-wrapped snacks has led to us losing our natural connection with food and eating without thinking. 'Obesity is very much a problem within society in the UK. We have a cultural difference in our country, where one set of people has a lot of money to spend, and other people don’t have very much at all, and this changes the way people approach dieting, or weight management. ‘So it is very much a societal problem. A lot of people are now referred to the NHS for weight related problems. 'But the NHS is supposed to be there to treat illness and sickness, so people have been asking is it really the NHS’s problem? ‘I don’t think obesity is a sickness or a disease, say like diabetes, but it is a different kind, it is a societal sickness.’","The less well off 'may be more tempted by the promise of a quick fix'

"We only use eight per cent of our DNA, scientists say. An Oxford University study has concluded that just 8.2 per cent of our DNA is likely to be doing something important. The rest is junk DNA – an evolutionary hangover that, much like the appendix, doesn’t do any good but also doesn’t do any harm. Much of it is doing nothing at all. An Oxford University study has concluded that just 8.2 per cent of our DNA is likely to be doing something important. The rest is junk DNA - an evolutionary hangover that, much like the appendix, doesn't do any good but also doesn't do any harm . Dr Gurton Lunter, the study’s joint lead researcher, said: ‘The vast majority of it is sitting there doing nothing. It is taking up space.’ It was previously estimated that 80 per cent of our DNA was ‘functional’ – or doing something useful. Being able to separate the wheat from the chaff is important because it will enable medical researchers to zero in on the DNA behind disease and so speed the search for new treatments and cures. Co-lead researcher Professor Chris Ponting said: ‘This isn’t just an academic argument about the nebulous word 'function'. These definitions matter. The researchers came up with the estimate of 8.2 per cent after comparing our DNA with that of various other mammals and looking for chunks that have stayed the same despite millions of years of evolution (stock picture used) Oxford University says that 91.8 per cent of our bodies is made up of 'junk' DNA. Junk DNA is essentially non-coding DNA which describes components of an organism's DNA that do not encode for protein sequences. This, claim scientists, is an evolutionary hangover that, much like the appendix, doesn’t do any good but also doesn’t do any harm. The latest estimate was very different from one given in 2012, when some scientists involved in the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (Encode) project stated that 80 per cent of our genome has some biochemical function. ‘From a medical point of view, this is essential to interpreting the role of human genetic variation in disease.’ The researchers came up with the estimate of 8.2 per cent after comparing our DNA with that of various other mammals and looking for chunks that have stayed the same despite millions of years of evolution. This lack of change was taken as a sign that it was doing something important. What is more, despite the common perception that our DNA is packed with genes, they make up just over one per cent of the eight per cent of useful genetic material. The other seven per cent or so is littered with switches that control these genes. Researcher Dr Chris Rands said: ‘We tend to have the expectation that all of our DNA must be doing something. ‘In reality, only a small part of it is.’ The study is published in the journal PLOS Genetic.","Scientists at Oxford University claim we only use 8 per cent of our DNA .

"Patients treated over the phone rather than face-to-face are far more likely to seek further medical help, a study has found. Telephone consultations with a GP meant they were 50 per cent more likely to call again, turn up at A&E or try to see a doctor out-of-hours. The figure was much higher for those who spoke to a practice nurse – with the vast majority needing further help. Time-wasting: The Government study found that telephone consultations with GPs do not save money . The Department of Health-funded study concluded that phone consultations do not save any money – and actually create more work, rather than less, for GPs. They also lead to practice nurses taking 100 times more phone calls than usual. The study, the first of its kind in the world, comes as the NHS places more and more emphasis on telephone care. One in eight GP consultations is now done over the phone – four times as many as 15 years ago. With a quarter of patients waiting more than a week for an appointment and one in ten giving up all together, the Government is encouraging contact by phone, email and even by Skype video conference calls. But there is concern that symptoms will be missed and patients will be misdiagnosed, sometimes with deadly consequences. Some patients may simply get flustered on the phone – and call back to get the answers they need. Professor John Campbell of Exeter University, who led the latest study, said telephone consultations were ‘basically safe’ but not a ‘silver bullet’. He added: ‘The ability to manage people effectively over the phone is probably limited. ‘There are some people you can manage but most people end up coming back into the system.’ Prof Campbell looked at the effect of ‘telephone triage’ across 42 GP practices in Bristol, Exeter, Norwich and Warwick. A third saw patients face-to-face, while the other two groups carried out phone consultations with a doctor or a nurse. Traditional: Patients often end up needing a face-to-face service anyway after the phonecalls . About half of patients using the normal system wanted more help or support within the next four weeks. But the number rose to 75 per cent when telephone triage with a GP was used. The figure was 88 per cent with a nurse. While doctors saw fewer patients face-to-face, they took ten times as many phone calls as usual. Nurses took 100 times as many, medical journal the Lancet reports. The analysis also found that patients called by nurses spent longer in hospital if they were admitted and were less satisfied – likely because they really wanted to speak to a GP. There were seven deaths among the phone triage patients – compared to just one among those treated as usual. But researchers say these deaths were not due to the type of consultation. Prof Campbell said phone triage may not represent ‘the most efficient’ use of time and urged practices think carefully before setting it up. He added: ‘You cannot just introduce triage and think you are going to manage all the GP workload. It is a much more complex situation.’ The charity Patient Concern said many patients prefer to use the phone rather than take time off work to visit the surgery. But the British Medical Association said many conditions can safely be treated only by direct examination and called for enough medical staff to deal with the rising demand for appointments among an ageing population. Labour’s shadow health minister Andrew Gwynne said the study proves the need for more face-to-face GP appointments. The Department of Health said it was offering 7.5million more people email, Skype and evening and weekend slots. A spokesman said: ‘GPs know what works best for their patients so can tailor their services as they see fit and based on what patients need.’","Telephone consultations make patients 50% more likely to need more help .

"Short, sharp bursts of exercise could transform the lives of the over-60s, research suggests. Just two one-minute sessions a week for six weeks dramatically improved the health and physical fitness of men and women in this age group. Blood pressure dropped and everyday tasks such as getting out of a chair or  carrying shopping became easier. Scroll down for video . Improving health: Blood pressure dropped and everyday tasks such as getting out of a chair or carrying shopping became easier, after the participants had carried out two one-minute sessions a week for six weeks . The researchers from Abertay University in Dundee said short sessions of high intensity exercise could help ease the ‘astronomical’ cost of ill-health in the elderly. High-intensity training, or HIT, purports to offer at least the same benefits as conventional activity but in the fraction of the time and is the subject of much research. The latest study is the first to focus on whether it may help older people. Researcher John Babraj put six men and women aged over 60 through their paces in his lab twice a week for six weeks. Each session began with them pedalling all-out on an exercise bike for six seconds before resting for at least a minute to allow their heart to recover and then giving it their all for another six seconds. Experiment: Researchers from Abertay University in Dundee (pictured) said short sessions of high intensity exercise could help ease the 'astronomical' cost of ill-health in the elderly . Although they began by doing six . six-second sprints, by end of the study, they were able to do ten per . session – adding up to 60 seconds of activity. After . just six weeks, blood pressure fell by 9 per cent and day-to-day . activities were easier, the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society . reports. Dr Babraj said: . ‘What we found with this study, which involves doing just one minute of . exercise twice a week, is that it not only improved the participants’ physical health and ability to do these things, but also their . perceptions of their own ability to engage in physical activity. ‘They enjoyed it, were delighted with the effects it had on their health and, on top of that, felt they could fit it into their lives, which is something they aren’t able to do with current exercise recommendations. ‘If people aren’t meeting the targets, we need to find ways to work with them when it comes to exercise, rather than just persisting with something that isn’t working. ‘High-intensity training is an achievable alternative that could make a real difference to people’s health and quality of life.’ Current guidelines say pensioners need to do at least two and a half hours of cycling or fast walking a week, plus two sessions of yoga, gardening or other activities that strengthen muscles. Dr Babraj said that those who do not have an exercise bike can get the same benefit from six-second runs up a steep hill and added: ‘When it comes to the sprints, you don’t have to go at the speed of someone like Usain Bolt. Tried it out: Andrew Marr has blamed the stroke he suffered on experimenting with high intensity exercise . ‘As long as you are putting in your  maximal effort, whatever speed that happens to be, it will improve your health.’ 'High-intensity training is an achievable alternative that could make a real difference to people’s health and quality of life' John Babraj, researcher . He said it could be argued that short, sharp sessions put less strain on the heart than lengthier, less intensive ones. BBC presenter Andrew Marr has blamed the stroke he suffered last year on experimenting with high intensity exercise. Dr Babraj cautioned that people should check with their doctor before embarking on a training programme. Caroline Abrahams of Age UK said: ‘There is a really strong body of research demonstrating the importance of exercise in later life. However it’s important to find the right exercise for you and consult your GP before trying any radical new approaches.’","Easier to do tasks such as getting out of chair or carrying shopping .

"It sounds like the perfect end to a long, hard day at work. But slumping in front of the TV might make you feel worse rather than better. People who are tired and stressed are consumed by feelings of guilt and failure when they give into the temptation to watch television, a study found. People who are tired and stressed are consumed by feelings of guilt when they give into the temptation to watch television, the 'Guilty Couch Potato' study by German and Dutch researchers found (file picture) It is thought that worry that their time would be better spent doing something else. They may also be concerned that others will look down on them for watching soaps, reality TV or other non-demanding programmes that are particularly appealing when tried. In a study entitled The Guilty Couch Potato, Dutch and German researchers asked almost 500 volunteers how tired they felt after finishing work, university or school the previous day. They were also asked if they had played video games or watched TV and how it had made them feel. Those who were most stressed in the evening got the least benefit from the supposedly relaxing activities, the Journal of Communication reports. Rather than feeling calm and refreshed, they felt guilty and experienced feelings of failure. They were also more likely to say that they had turned on the TV as a way of avoiding doing something else. The researchers say that tiredness makes us particularly likely to give into the temptation of TV or other non-demanding tasks and when we do, we then tend to feel guilty about our lack of self-control. The study, published in the Journal of Communication, found that those who were most stressed in the evening got the least benefit from supposedly relaxing activities such as watching television (file picture) Dr Leonard Reinecke, of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz in Germany, said: ‘The act of the giving in to the urge for media seems to fuel the tendency to feel guilty about media use. ‘Compared to other leisure-time activities, entertaining media use tends to be perceived as less productive and cultural valuable. ‘Individuals engaging in entertaining media use rather than other, more socially-valued leisure activities such as sports, personal improvement activities like meditation or art, or social activities, might thus be especially prone to feel guilty when indulging in media instead.’ He added that the increasing use of mobile technology makes it easier than ever for us to tune into our favourite programmes and games while on the go. The researcher said: ‘In times of smartphones and mobile internet, the ubiquitous availability of content and communication often seems to be a burden and stressor rather than a recovery source.’","Sitting in front of television could make people feel guilty, researchers found .

"They are the most loyal of pets, so it is perhaps no surprise that dogs become jealous when we don’t show the same level of devotion. A study found that dogs, like people, can experience envy. Faced to watch their owner pet a potential rival, they snap, jump, paw and push. Scroll down for video . The University of California studied 36 dogs in their own homes while owners were told to ignore their pet in favour of a stuffed dog or a bucket. Dogs exhibited jealous behaviour such as snapping and pushing when their owner displayed affection for the stuffed toy. Stock image pictured . While dog owners may not find the result very surprising, some scientists have argued that the complexity of thought behind jealousy makes it a uniquely human emotion. For centuries, dogs have been man's best friend. But it turns out canines would drop humanity for artificial intelligence in a second if offered a treat. A study in Animal Cognition found that dogs interacted with robots similar to how they would with humans if those robots seemed 'social'. The researchers conducted their experiment by having a robot point out hidden food to a dog and measuring their reactions to the robots directions. But the dogs were better able to find the hidden food when the robot had a human face on it's monitor, and acted 'socially'. To find out if this was the case, the University of California researchers videoed 36 dogs in their own homes as their owners ignored them in favour of a stuffed dog, another toy or a book. The toy dog barked, whined and wagged its tail at the push of a button and the real dogs seemed to be taken in by the act. They were around twice as likely to push or touch their owner when he or she was petting and talking sweetly to the stuffed dog as when the owner was displaying the same behaviour towards the other toy. Even fewer pushed or touched their owner when the book was being read aloud. Just under a third of the dogs also tried to get between their owner and the stuffed animal and a quarter snapped at the ‘other dog’ but only one did so at the other toy and the book. The study found the dogs were around twice as likely to push or touch their owner when he or she was petting and talking sweetly to the false dog (stock image pictured left) as when the owner was displaying the same behaviour towards the bucket (stock image pictured right) Samwise (pictured) was one of three border collies that inspired the study on dog jealousy . This shows that the dogs weren’t simply reacting to the loss of attention and affection. Instead, . their main concern seemed to be that this attention and affection had . been switched to another dog, the journal PLOS ONE reports. The fact that most of the pets tried to sniff the bottom of the toy dog also suggests that they thought it was real. Researcher Professor Christine Harris . said: ‘Our study suggests not only that dogs do engage in what appear to . be jealous behaviours but also that they were seeking to break up that . connection between the owner and a seeming rival. ‘We . can’t really speak to the dogs’ subjective experiences, of course, but . it looks as though they were motivated to protect an important social . relationship.’ She added . that research into jealousy is important because it can have . far-reaching consequences, including, at the extreme, murder. The professor said her findings suggest that jealousy is not uniquely human.  Nor is it simply tied to sex and romance. And . with babies as young as six weeks seemingly capable of experiencing . envy, it may have evolved as a way of ensuring that the very young can . compete with siblings for parental love and help.","The University of California studied 36 dogs in their own homes .
Owners were told to ignore their pet in favour of a stuffed dog or a bucket .
In a third test, the owner was asked to read a musical pop-up book .
Dogs exhibited jealous behaviour such as snapping and pushing when their owner displayed affection for the stuffed dog .
This behaviour was twice as likely than when the owner touched the bucket .
Even fewer pushed or touched their owner when the book was being read ."
"You buy her flowers, shower her with compliments and listen to everything she says. Yet she doesn’t want to see you again. If scientists are right, you were simply too nice. Research into first dates suggests that while men like a woman who hangs onto their every word, women are less impressed by nice men. Too much? Research has suggested that being too attentive on a date can fail to please women . In fact, they may find a caring, sharing male as a bit of a wimp or even slightly creepy. The researchers said: ‘Women may be suspicious of a responsive stranger’s intentions, attributing his responsiveness to possible ulterior motives.’ Psychologists from Israel and the U.S. ran three experiments in which two strangers chatted either face-to-face or online. One member of the pair was instructed to unburden themselves of a problem that was troubling them, from money worries to a failed exam or an argument with friend, while the second listened and responded. Creepy? It has been suggested that being too nice can lead women to think a date has ulterior motives . The men liked being paired with a woman who was caring and sympathetic. Such a female was rated as being more feminine and more attractive. Plus, a woman who was a good listener was seen as potential for a long-term relationships, the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin reports. It seems a woman’s concern may have boosted the male ego, as well as making her seem like good mother material. Lead researcher Gurit Birnbaum, of the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya in Israel, said: ‘Men may interpret women’s responsiveness as a sign of sexual interest and react accordingly by perceiving them as more attractive.’ However, the women did not find a caring man more appealing or any more masculine. If anything, they found him slightly less attractive. The researchers believe that this doesn’t necessarily mean women are hard-hearted. Instead, the different reactions of the women taking part may simply have cancelled each other out. For instance, a caring man may have be viewed as a good catch, a wimp or a creep. Dr Birnbaum said: ‘Women may perceive this man as inappropriately nice and manipulative - i.e. trying to obtain sexual favours, or eager to please, perhaps even as desperate, and therefore less sexually appealing. ‘Alternatively women may perceive a responsive man as vulnerable and less dominant. ‘Other women may perceive a responsive stranger as warm and caring and therefore as a desirable long-term partner. ‘Regardless of the reasons, perhaps men should slow down if their goal is to instil sexual desire. ‘Sexual desire thrives on rising intimacy and being responsive is one of the best ways to instil this elusive sensation over time. ‘Our finding show this does not necessarily hold true in an initial encounter because a responsive potential partner may convey opposite meanings to different people.'","Researchers simulated dozens of first dates - and responsive men lost out .

"Gentler: The treatment uses a hormone which is naturally produced in the body and therefore believed to be gentler on the body than the current IVF drug . Women desperate to become mothers could soon benefit from a kinder, safer form of IVF based on a ‘chocolate hormone’. Doctors at Imperial College London are perfecting a treatment that capitalises on the body’s own way of ripening eggs. They report that 12 babies have been born so far. This should spare patients pain and discomfort – and also cut the odds of potentially life-threatening complications. The new treatment uses a hormone called kisspeptin, which is naturally made in the body. It was discovered in the mid-1990s by researchers in Hershey, Pennsylvania, and is named after Hershey’s Chocolate Kisses. Kisspeptin is thought to trigger the ripening of eggs during normal pregnancies and so should be gentler on the body than human chorionic gonadotropin, a drug used in IVF at the moment. It is also broken down more quickly, which should also cut the risk  of problems. Some 53 IVF patients were given the ‘chocolate hormone’ in the study and 12 babies were born. None of the women suffered from ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) which can cause nausea, vomiting and bloating. Three had ectopic pregnancies – a potentially fatal complication in which the embryo implants outside the womb – but that may have been a statistical blip, the Journal of Clinical Investigation reports. One of the babies is Owen Harper, whose doctors described the treatment as very promising. Baby Owen’s mother, Alison Harper, 31, of Hertfordshire, had experienced the discomfort of mild  OHSS earlier. She said: ‘I went through several cycles of IVF previously but the one in the trial was the least uncomfortable – it was less painful and I felt less swollen.’ The hormone - kisspeptin - was discovered in Hershey, Pennsylvania, and named after Hershey's Kisses . Research Professor Waljit Dhillo said: ‘Our study has shown that kisspeptin can be used as a trigger for egg maturation in IVF therapy. ‘It’s been a joy to see 12 healthy babies born using this approach.’ Some doctors said the trial was too small to be meaningful but Dr Mark Hamilton, a former chairman of the British Fertility Society, said the births are ‘very exciting’.","Found in Hershey, Pennsylvania, named after Hershey's Chocolate Kisses .

"The French are to pay a major tribute to the part British forces played in saving Paris from the Germans during World War I. In what is seen as a major change in attitude, President Francois Hollande will lead the tributes. He will visit the Museum of the Great War, at Meaux, east of Paris, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the First Battle of the Marne. Trench warfare on the Marne German gun position, Marne, France during World War I . A war memorial in France to the British officers who fell in the battles of Aisne and Marne . It is usually portrayed as a Franco-German action, in which the so-called ‘Miracle of the Marne’ forced the Kaiser’s Imperial Army to abandon its advance on Paris. But in fact, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) under Sir John French was at the forefront of the fighting. Former French government minister Jean-François Copé, who is also the mayor of Meaux, said: ‘We must remember that this victory was a victory for the Allies together. ‘Indeed, the British Army, though numerically small, was decisive in the first months of the conflict.’ Francois Holland (centre), speaking today at the NATO summit in Newport, Wales, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, will lead the tributes to the British soldiers . Mr Hollande will be in Meaux at the end of next week, while Prince Andrew will be in Frétoy, north east of Paris, on Sunday. It is there, on September 7, 1914, that the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers took part in the last ‘lance on lance’ action of the Great War. The Prince will honour some 100 British troops who served in Afghanistan with medals. The main exhibition at the Meaux museum, one of the most impressive in Europe, now concentrates on the BEF’s progress from August to December 1914. Many landed in France thinking the war would be over by Christmas, but were soon involved bloody battles, including Marne, which started 100 years ago tomorrow. The Museum of the Great War at Meaux, east of Paris, where President Hollande will visit to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the First Battle of the Marne . After a week of fierce fighting, the Germans’ pursuit of the Allied armies was repelled along the Marne River. French troops famously arrived in taxis from central Paris, where the population feared the humiliation of occupation. Once the Germans were themselves forced to retreat, the war turned into four years of bloody trench warfare, in which millions were killed and wounded. Sir John French’s baton is on loan to the French from the Imperial War Museum in London, while the Meaux exhibition tells of the ‘common strategy’ they developed. Famous marching songs including ‘It’s a Long Way To Tipperary’ will be played throughout the week of commemorations, and the Royal Navy’s decisive victories early in the war will also be featured. French politicians have, over the years, been accused of underplaying Britain’s role in the world wars at the expense of their own efforts, and America’s. But President Hollande has done much to reverse this trend – regularly paying tribute to the sacrifice millions of Britons made.","French President Francois Hollande will lead the tributes to British troops .

"Pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine have brought their own idiosyncratic take on the Scottish independence debate as they back the Yes vote. Separatists have been mockingly comparing the battle for Ukraine with the referendum in Scotland, asking why England doesn't use military force and poking fun at the Queen and US President Barack Obama. One supporter of Novorossiya - the breakaway region of eastern Ukraine - posted a picture of the Saltire on Twitter along with the tongue in cheek question in Russian: 'Why doesn't England bomb the Scottish separatists?' Pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine have brought their own idiosyncratic take on the Scottish independence debate as they back the Yes vote. One supporter of Novorossiya posted this picture of the Saltire on Twitter along with the tongue in cheek question in Russian: 'Why doesn't England bomb the Scottish separatists?' In one Twitter post a mock-up showed the Queen in discussions with Barack Obama. In the post, the Queen says: 'Obama, Scotland wants to separate! Help them to calm them down. Accuse them of running a bloody regime.' Obama replies with: 'And is there oil in Scotland?'The Queen answers: 'I will not give it to you!' Before Obama responds with: 'Sorry, Liz! No oil - no bloody regime!' The meaning seems to be that the British government has not - as it should have done in Moscow's eyes - objected to military action against separatist areas populated by pro-Russians in Ukraine, yet it would never think of using force against Scotland. Other postings show feared pro-Moscow rebel military commanders Igor Strelkov and Alexander 'Babay' Mozhaev dressed in kilts ready to intervene in Scotland. 'Babay will come. Will bring order to Scotland,' reads the text. On the Strelkov picture, the wording is: 'Scotlandia will be free' Another mock-up showed the Queen in discussions on the Scottish vote for independence with Barack Obama.

Elsewhere, pro-Vladimir Putin Russian MP Konstantin Rykov renames himself McRykov to insist: 'Scotland will be free.' Meanwhile, Ukraine's president today said Russia had removed the bulk of its forces from his country. The announcement has raised hopes for a peace drive which is now underway after five months of conflict in which more than 3,000 people have been killed. A Pro-Russian separatist fighter holds a grenade as he stands guard at a check point on a road at Donetsk airport on Wednesday . Ukraine's president today said Russia had removed the bulk of its forces from his country. Pictured are pro-Russian separatist fighters at Donetsk airport . Moscow has always denied sending troops into eastern Ukraine to support pro-Russian rebels battling Ukrainian forces, despite what Kiev and its Western backers say is overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Moscow also denies arming the separatists. Speaking during a televised cabinet meeting, President Petro Poroshenko said Ukraine would remain a sovereign united country under the terms of a peace roadmap approved last Friday. He did say however that parts of the east under rebel control would get special status. He said: 'According to the latest information I have received from our intelligence, 70 per cent of Russian troops have been moved back across the border. 'This further strengthens our hope that the peace initiatives have good prospects.' Poroshenko did say however the ceasefire was not proving easy to maintain because 'terrorists' were constantly trying to provoke Kiev's forces.

Speaking during a televised cabinet meeting, President Petro Poroshenko said Ukraine would remain a sovereign united country under the terms of a peace roadmap approved last Friday. Pictured is a pro-Russian separatist at Donetsk airport . Ukraine's military recorded at least six violations of the ceasefire overnight but said there were no casualties. Five servicemen have been killed during the ceasefire, Ukraine says. A civilian was also killed at the weekend during shelling of the eastern port of Mariupol. Poroshenko said Ukraine was regrouping its forces in eastern Ukraine, not in preparation for a new offensive against the rebels, as they have suggested, but in order to defend territory from possible attack by the separatists. The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin and Poroshenko were broadly satisfied with how the ceasefire, in place for nearly five days, was holding in Ukraine. The two leaders spoke by phone on Tuesday for the second time this week. In his televised remarks, Poroshenko offered the rebels an olive branch by saying he would propose a bill next week offering 'special status' to parts of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions of eastern Ukraine they now control. But he was adamant in rejecting the separatists' demands for full independence for their regions and the kind of radical 'federalisation' favoured by Russia. 'The Minsk protocol envisages the restoration and preservation of Ukrainian sovereignty on all the territory of the Donbass (in eastern Ukraine), including that controlled by the fighters,' Poroshenko said. Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko has said the ceasefire was not proving easy to maintain because 'terrorists' were constantly trying to provoke Kiev's forces . 'There is no question of federalisation or separation of any Ukrainian territory.' The European Union and United States have imposed economic sanctions against Russia over its role in Ukraine, prompting Moscow to retaliate by banning most Western food imports. The EU has prepared another wave of sanctions targeting Russia's banking and energy sectors but has held off implementing them to see whether the ceasefire holds. On Wednesday, Poroshenko signed a law allowing Ukraine to impose its own sanctions against Russian firms and individuals deemed to be backing the separatists in eastern Ukraine. In Prague, the chairman of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is monitoring the ceasefire, said it would be reasonable to allow more time for the peace process before imposing more sanctions against Russia. Didier Burkhalter, who is president of Switzerland, also said the OSCE would soon deploy drones to monitor the ceasefire. Human rights group Amnesty International said in Moscow it had documented evidence of war crimes by both sides and also repeated criticism of Russia's role in the conflict. 'Amnesty International has called the conflict in Ukraine an international conflict and Russia a party to that conflict,' the group's secretary general, Salil Shetty, told a news conference.","Pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine back the Yes vote in Scottish referendum .

"Islamic extremists today said they would murder a French tourist captured in Algeria 'within 24 hours' if Paris did not halt its intervention in Iraq. The sinister threat was made by Jund al-Khilifa (Soldiers of the Caliphate), who are using exactly the same tactics as the Iraq and Syria-based terror group IS (Islamic State), also known as Isis. Jund al-Khilifa have released a video showing Herve Pierre Gourdel, 55, flanked by two hooded men clutching Kalashnikov assault rifles. The footage was confirmed as authentic, and came after IS urged Muslims around the world to kill 'the spiteful and filthy' French. An image grab taken from a video released by Jund al-Khilifa group via YouTube, which allegedly shows French tourist Herve Pierre Gourdel (centre), sitting between two armed jihadists at an undisclosed location . France has been accused of paying ransoms to terrorists in the past, but on Friday its airforce launched bombing raids on IS forces in Iraq. Today Prime Minister Manuel Valls said there would be 'no discussion, no negotiation and we will never give in to blackmail, even if we are of course very worried after the authentication of this video.' Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve also tried to reassure the country, saying: 'France is not afraid, France is prepared to respond to their threat.' Jund al-Khilifa, which has pledged its allegiance to IS, said it would kill Mr Gourdel, who is from Nice, within a day. The group said it captured him while he was hiking with friends in a mountainous region of eastern Algeria. Algeria, which won independence from France in 1962 following a bitter war of independence, is a hotbed of Islamic terrorism. Jund al-Khilifa, which has pledged its allegiance to IS (pictured), said it would kill Mr Gourdel, who is from Nice, within a day . The Tizi Ouzou region, where Mr Gourdel was abducted, has been the scene of attacks by al Qaeda's North African branch, AQIM (Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb). They have been operating in the mountainous wooded area for more than a decade, since the end of the brutal civil war which decimated Algeria during the 1990s. On Monday, Islamic State (IS) issued an audio statement calling on Muslims everywhere to kill citizens of nations that have joined the fight against jihadist groups in Iraq. Spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani called on followers to 'kill a disbelieving American or European - especially the spiteful and filthy French - or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other disbeliever from the disbelievers waging war'. US aircraft have carried out more than 170 strikes since August 8, and President Barack Obama has since been creating an international coalition against the terrorist movement. The bombing campaign was launched to protect Iraqi Kurdistan from advancing IS forces. Jihadists who already controlled parts of neighbouring Syria captured the Iraqi city of Mosul on June 10th. They have also enjoyed success against the Iraqi army, while carrying out a series of atrocities against non-Muslim groups, including Christians. IS videos of the beheading of two US journalists and a British aid worker in Syria sparked international outrage, as well as calls for more action to crush them. IS's latest web propaganda will lead to an increase in security and surveillance in France, where 'home-grown' Jihadists are as common as they are in Britain.","Threat made by Jund al-Khilifa against Frenchman Herve Pierre Gourdel .

"France's foreign minister today said Tony Blair should keep his advice about combating the Islamic terrorists of IS to himself. Laurent Fabius made it clear that his country did not appreciate the former British Prime Minister suggesting that ground troops should be used against them. 'And where Iraq is concerned, I'm not sure that Mr Blair is the best placed to give out advice,' Mr Fabius told BFMTV from New York, where he is taking part in the UN General Assembly. Anger: France's foreign minister today said Tony Blair should keep his advice about combating the Islamic terrorists of IS to himself . Mr Blair, who sent troops to invade Iraq along with the Americans in 2003, wrote in an essay for his Faith Foundation that Western powers should consider the use of ground forces 'in the future if it is absolutely necessary'. The 2003 Anglo-American invasion of Iraq toppled the regime of the dictator Saddam Hussein but led to hundreds of thousands of deaths. It also led to chaos within the liberated country, allowing jihadist groups such as IS - Islamic State - to flourish. Mr Blair sent troops to invade Iraq along with the Americans in 2003 . France started an aerial bombardment of IS forces in Iraq last Friday, with Mr Fabius saying the operation would be 'a long term affair'. He said: 'If France, like many other countries, has taken a firm stance, it's because we are defending ourselves.' His comments came as America and five Arabic countries launched dozens of air strikes against Isis, killing at least 20 militants and blasting a series of its bases. The attacks - described as 'shock without awe' - began early this morning local time, with Tomahawk missiles, B1 bombers, F16, F18 and F22 strike fighters and drones involved. A total of 50 . American air power was backed by warplanes from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, all of whom are determined to destroy ISIS, which they see as a threat to their own governments. Strong presence: Military leaders have said about two-thirds of the estimated 31,000 Islamic State militants were in Syria. The U.S. has also been increasing its surveillance flights over Syria, getting better intelligent on potential targets and militant movements . Two U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Arab participation was essential for Obama as he looked to expand the American campaign of air strikes to Syria from Iraq, where the U.S. military has already carried out 190 strikes as of Monday. Several Arab countries have offered to join the United States in air strikes against Islamic State targets, a senior U.S. official told reporters on Sept. 14. But the United States has so far refused to detail which nations have given private assurances to Washington that they would join in air strikes in Syria, part of a broader strategy against the Islamic State that includes training and arming moderate Syrian opposition fighters. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said in television interviews over the weekend that other nations were willing to join air strikes in Syria. Vital allies: All the U.S. partners in the airstrikes against Syria are Middle Eastern nations. They are Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan and Bahrain. Here, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal, second from right, and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, left, and their representatives, pause for photos at the end of their meeting in New York on Monday . 'I will make you a prediction,' Power said on ABC. 'We will not do the air strikes alone if the president decides to do the air strikes.' Several Arab states have powerful air forces, including Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia, for example, has also already agreed to host U.S. training of Syrian opposition fighters. But many Gulf Arab states have been reluctant to be seen aggressively joining the U.S. campaign in Iraq and Syria, fearing in some cases reprisals by extremists or forces loyal to the Syrian government. The White House last week declined to 'telegraph' when strikes might occur or what preconditions stood in the way. Obama will give a speech at the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday to make the case again for world action against Islamic State. Powerful air force: Seen here is a Royal Saudi Air Force Panavia Tornado IDS, part of the nation's substantial air fleet . News of the airstrikes comes as ISIS' highly-organized press office released a second propaganda video appearing to feature captured British hostage John Cantlie. The journalist - wearing a Guantanamo Bay-style orange jumpsuit - is filmed questioning America's preparation for attacks on ISIS, and compares the 'unwinnable' conflict to the Vietnam War. 'The president once called George Bush's Iraq conflict a ""dumb war"", and couldn't wait to distance America from it when he came into power. Now he's being inextricably drawn back in,' Cantlie says. The air strikes were launched from land bases in the Middle East, while the F18s were launched from the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush, which is in the Persian Gulf. Tomahawks were fired from the USS Arleigh Burke, a guided missile destroyer in the Red Sea. Tomahawk: Military officials a revealed that Tomahawk missiles (file photo of the sea-to-land missile seen here) were being launched at Syrian targets from the Persian Gulf and Red Sea .

The first wave of strikes lasted for 90 minutes and one video on social media showed blasts across Raqqa, the de facto capital of the Islamic state. Among the targets which reports from social media claimed had been hit were the city's governor's house, national hospital and the Equestrian Club. One account said 20 of the militant group's fighters had been killed in the strikes. Other targets were hit in Deir al-Zor province in the north of Syria, where ISIS have gained territory. And areas held by the al-Qaeda group called Al-Nusra Front in Aleppo and Idlib were also struck, sources said. Just the beginning?

"Dragons’ Den star and businessman Duncan Bannatyne has reportedly dropped out of a £60,000 deal after it was revealed to be linked to a British millionaire being investigated for murder. Mr Bannatyne, 65, had pledged the sizeable investment to Tracy Baker on Tuesday’s nights Dragons’ Den in return for a 35 per cent stake in her franchise of UM!Brands tech business – a stick and peel glue-type product to help mount household items. However, the Scottish entrepreneur has now apparently decided he wants ‘nothing more to do with it’, after it was revealed Ms Baker is the fiancé of 45-year-old Ian Griffin who is accused of killing a former girlfriend. Scroll down for video . Dragon Duncan Bannatyne (above) appeared to like Ms Baker's business plan and pledged £60,000 in funding. However, he has now pulled out of the deal after it was linked to Ian Griffin - a businessman accused of murder . Ian Griffin, 45, (right) who faces trial for murder, is the fiancé of businesswoman Tracy Baker (left) Griffin (right), from Chesire but who now lives in Cannes, is accused of murdering his former girlfriend Kinga Legg, 36 (left). She was found dead n the bathroom of their £1,000-a-night suite at hotel in Paris, France in 2009 . Mr Bannatyne's alleged U-turn comes after Griffin boasted that he was linked to Ms Baker's business idea - telling friends on Facebook he had 'won dragons den' with the idea. Griffin, originally from Cheshire but who now lives in Cannes, France, allegedly killed his then girlfriend Kinga Legg, 36, during a trip to Paris in 2009. The Polish businesswoman, who ran a successful firm exporting more than 300 million tomatoes a year to major companies such as McDonald’s and Tesco, was found dead in the bathroom of their £1,000-a-night suite at the Hotel Bristol. Griffin fled the scene and was found two weeks later in woodland near Chelford, Macclesfield, less than 15 minutes from his parents' Cheshire home. He was arrested under Section 9 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, which covers any murder or manslaughter committed outside the UK. After nearly two years of legal argument and health concerns in British custody, he was extradited to France in May 2011. He was sent to Fresnes, one of the toughest high- security prisons in Paris, while the investigating magistrate decided on charges and whether the case should come to court. However, in March last year, he was unexpectedly released from custody by the judge who ruled he was no longer considered at risk of absconding or a risk to other people. Griffin's fiancée took home a £60,000 investment for her franchise of Um!Brands tech business – a stick and peel glue-type product to help mount household items – during the BBC's Dragon's Den which aired on Tuesday . Tracy Baker, 33, is said to have rekindled her relationship with Griffin while he was in custody in Britain . He now lives in Cannes, France, and remains 'under investigation' for murder. He faces trial for the offence of which he is accused, although it is thought a trial date has not yet been set. It was while he was in custody in Britain that he rekindled his relationship with Ms Baker, a former girlfriend who sympathised with his plight and often visited him. The pair became engaged immediately after his release from French prison last March. It is thought to have been around this time that Ms Baker invested in the Um!Brands franchise. On Tuesday night's Dragons’ Den, she told the panel of potential investors how she was effectively acting as a 'distributor' for the innovative product and wanted investment to help major stores take orders. While Deborah Meaden, Peter Jones, Piers Linney and Kelly Hoppen opted against the investment, Mr Bannatyne appeared to like the concept and pledged £60,000 in funding in return for a 35 per cent stake. Griffin took to Facebook last month to inform friends he had 'just won the dragons den' and did it 'from prison through my girlfriend'. The posts are thought to be in relation to Tuesday's episode which was filmed in spring . However, after Ms Baker’s links to the alleged murderer were revealed following airing of the show, Mr Bannatyne reportedly opted out of the business deal. A source to the star told The Sun: ‘Duncan knew nothing of the background to the business. When he found out he wanted nothing more to do with it.’ In the wake of Tuesday night’s show it emerged businessman Griffin had boasted on his Facebook page how it was him who had 'won' the investment. In a post last month, he said: ‘Forgot to mention, just won the dragons den last week too. Did that from prison though my girlfriend :).’ In a separate post, he also wrote: ‘We are on TV for 12 minutes in the next 30 days, its prime-time and national and possibly global too. I had to use a different name due to my position at the moment but I think you will recognise the face beaming away.’ It is thought the posts were in relation to last night’s episode which was filmed in the spring. Griffin has been under investigation for murder since 2009 when his former girlfriend, Polish businesswoman Kinga Legg, was found dead in the bathroom of a £1,000-a-night suite at Hotel Bristol (above) in Paris, France . However, there was no sign of Griffin during the episode and the BBC has categorically denied he was involved in any of the filming or had been on the set. His fiancée also denied yesterday that he was the brains behind the business – claiming his posts were in reference to another venture. She told The Sun: ‘Ian was talking about another business – he has nothing to do with the company.’ MailOnline has contacted representatives of Duncan Bannatyne and Tracy Baker for further comment. UM!Brands creates a range of products which mount housewares using nano-suction technology . Tracy Baker went on BBC’s Dragon’s Den to lay out a business plan for her franchise of UM!Brands. The U.S.-based UM!Brands is an innovative product using nano-suction technology which allows items such as hooks and mirrors to adhere securely to any surface. It claims to leave no mark to the surface and sticks far better – holding a weight of up to 10 pounds – than any normal sticky-glue type adhesive product. The nano-suction – using the power of millions of miniature suction cups which can barely be seen by the naked eye – can be applied to the back of most housewares for easy mounting. UM!Brands sells a range of products which are already backed with the clever technology, including hooks, frames, mirrors and notepad organisers. While the brand is already popular in the U.S. and sold in major chains such as Walmart and Staples, Miss Baker told the Dragons she had obtained exclusivity rights to sell to the UK and Europe. She said she had already received an order from Wilkinsons – which has some stores currently stocking the product – but wanted investment of £60,000 to help with point of sale and marketing via her website.

"Francois Hollande is preparing to marry his mistress on his 60th birthday next month, according to sensational media reports in France. The country’s bachelor president has been plagued by rumours about his personal life since splitting up with his live-in-girlfriend in January. Valerie Trierweiler, 49, had to leave the Elysee when Mr Hollande’s secret affair with Julie Gayet, a 42-year-old actress, was made public. Scroll down for video . Claims: President Francois Hollande (left) is preparing to marry his mistress Julie Gayet (right), a 42-year-old actress, on his 60th birthday next month, according to sensational media reports in France . Miss Gayet has kept a low profile ever since – refusing to even acknowledge she is seeing the head of state – but may now be preparing to tie the knot. Midi Libre, the highly respected newspaper, is one of many which reports: ‘The President of the Republic could make official his relationship with Julie Gayet by marrying her on August 12, the date of his sixtieth birthday.’ A Socialist Party source meanwhile told the Parisien newspaper: ‘It’s been three months that we have been hearing that he intends to formalise his relationship with Julia Gayet on August 12, when they will marry.’ The rumours intensified on July 14, Bastille Day, when Mr Hollande was asked directly about his private life in a live interview. Mr Hollande said: ‘When I have information, I’ll communicate it, I’ll do it, but I have none.’ Out: Valerie Trierweiler (right), 49, had to leave the Elysee when the secret affair of Mr Hollande (left) and Miss Gayet, a 42-year-old actress, was made public . According to the new claims, arrangements have now been made for a simple civic ceremony. Mr Hollande, a Socialist, has never expressed any interest in the institution of marriage before, despite having four children with his Ecology Minister, Segolene Royal, another former girlfriend. 'When I have information, I’ll communicate it, I’ll do it, but I have none' Francois Hollande . But it is thought that Mr Hollande has felt increasingly uncomfortable attending official engagements without an official partner. If the marriage goes ahead, it will mean that France will have another ‘celebrity’ first lady, following four years of former supermodel and pop singer Carla Bruni, up until 2012. While Julie Gayet, a divorced mother of two, is barely known internationally, she is a well-known TV actress in France, having regularly appeared in a number of programmes, films and talk shows. Comparison: If the marriage goes ahead, it will mean that France will have another 'celebrity' first lady, after four years of former supermodel and pop singer Carla Bruni (pictured with Nicolas Sarkozy), up until 2012 . Despite this, she launched civil proceedings against magazines for publishing pictures of Mr Hollande arriving at flat in Paris on the back of a moped. 'It’s been three months that we have been hearing that he intends to formalise his relationship with Julia Gayet on August 12, when they will marry' Socialist Party source . She and the President were using the love nest, almost next door to the Elysee Palace, for secret trysts while Ms Trierweiler portrayed herself as first lady. Ms Trierweiler suffered an emotional breakdown when she heard about the deception, checking herself into hospital for more than a week. In recent weeks there have been rumours that Mr Hollande and Ms Trierweiler were intending to get back together again, but a marriage involving Miss Gayet would of course end all hope.","Claim over Francois Hollande made in sensational French media reports .

"The number of illegal migrants arrested as they try to get to Britain from Calais has doubled to more than 7,000 in six months – and many are being released immediately, new figures revealed yesterday. Despite tougher security measures introduced by the French, there has been a huge increase in those trying to make their way through the Channel Port to the UK. Figures compiled by the local prefecture show 7,414 were arrested between January and June this year. The number of illegal migrants arrested as they try to get to Britain from Calais has doubled to more than 7,000 in six months . This compares to 3,129 for the same period in 2013. Most said they wanted to claim asylum in Britain – a procedure which would allow them to claim social security and other benefits. A source at the Calais port told AFP, France’s national news agency: ‘We have noted that there are considerably more illegal migrants, and during our checks we find more’. Some 1,200 were arrested in the first two weeks of this month alone, and most were released straight away because of overcrowding in detention centres, said the source. This allows them to return to Calais, or other French ports, where they play a cat-and-mouse game with the police as they try and get aboard lorries and ferries. Last week the mayor of Calais passed an official decree banning the setting up of camps in areas, saying they were a danger to public health. A number of illegal camps have been bulldozed, with the authorities doing everything possible to get the migrants to leave the town. The migrant camp near the Ferry port in Calais, France is cleared by Gendarmerie and diggers. Despite tougher security measures introduced by the French, there has been a huge increase in those trying to make their way through the Channel Port to the UK . But this has not stopped hundreds from African countries like Sudan, Somalia and Eritrea arriving, along with others from war torn nations such as Iraq and Afghanistan. Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart has long argued that Britain’s ‘generous welfare system’ is the real cause of the migrant crisis in her town. Her deputy, Philippe Mignonet, who is also the port’s immigration chief, said in December that Britain needed to do more to address the numbers of migrants crossing its borders because it had become ‘a magnet for illegal immigrants’. Mr Mignonet claimed that the migrants refused all help on offer Calais in the hope of making it across the border. He explained: ‘They only want to go to England, as simple as that. They refuse everything, all the facilities that can be offered, they are refusing because they want to go to England’ The town hall official also accused Britain of not helping their French neighbours combat the problem: ‘They’ve got no role, they don’t do anything.’.","Number of illegal immigrants arrested trying to reach Britain doubles .

"A Swedish politician yesterday emerged as yet another secret love child of France’s former Socialist President Francois Mitterand. Mitterand, a notorious philanderer, was infamous for keeping an entire ‘secret’ family on the taxpayers’ expense during his 14 years in office, the longest term in his country’s history. Now it has emerged that he fathered a son, Hravn Forsne, when he was well into his 70s and towards the end of his career, which came to a halt in 1995. Family resemblance? Mr Forsne, left, who is now running for the . Swedish parliament for the Moderate party, confirmed that Mr Mitterand . was his father in an interview with Stockholm journalists . Mr Forsne, . who is now running for the Swedish parliament for the Moderate party, . confirmed that Mr Mitterand was his father in an interview with . Stockholm journalists. ‘I want to be judged for who I am, not who my father was,’ said Mr . Forsne, saying that he only met his elderly ‘secret’ father ‘five or . six’ times before his death in 1996. Mr . Forsne’s mother, Christina Forsne, was a Paris correspondent for a . Swedish news agency and had a 15 year relationship with the French head . of state between 1980 and 1995. During this time Mr Mitterand was married to Danielle, the mother of his three sons, and also a committed Socialist first lady. But he was also juggling his life with another mistress, Anne Pingeot, and they had a daughter, Mazarine. Mr Mitterrand always had an unconventional love life. In 1974, when he was the unsuccessful Socialist candidate his mistress, Anne . Pingeot was pregnant by him with their daughter Mazarine. Charles Moore's book 'François Mitterand: A womanising president who shaped Europe' delved into his unconventional marriage. During his presidency, he lived with his wife, Danielle, and her . lover, in the rue de Bievre, whilst his mistress, Anne, lived just 10 minutes . away from them. Shortly after . he became president in 1981, he did not live in the Élysée Palace. Instead, he . slept with Anne nightly at a residence on the quai Branly. Years later, . it emerged that the taxpayer funded a protection squad of 36 men for this unusual . arrangement. Secret family: Mazarine Mitterrand (right), daughter of Francois Mitterrand and her mother Anne Pingeot (left) at his funeral . Even on state . visits, the former president took his mistress and not his wife along with him. In 1987, he took . Anne and Mazarine to Egypt, and walked with them to the summit of Mount Sinai – . to prove he was in good health at 71. The French politician had a complicated love life throughout his life, and, even made one of . his ex-lovers, Édith Cresson, prime minister. However, Mr Mitterand was . the only president to have had his extra-marital relations confirmed after newspaper Paris-Match . obtained images of his daughter in 1994, and asked for the president's permission to . publish them. Two years later his wife invited his mistress and daughter to attend the . president's funeral. Mazarine, now 39, has already recounted the trauma of growing up as one of France’s most closely guarded secrets. She said her ‘hidden childhood’ weighed so heavily on her young shoulders that she later had to have counselling. Mazarine said she was not allowed to call her father ‘Papa’ in public and had to hide in cars when driven to and from the Elysee presidential palace. When news of her existence became public towards the end of Mr Mitterrand’s presidency, in 1994, she said she felt she was ‘the shame of the Republic’. When asked directly if Mr Mitterrand was indeed Hravn’s father, his mother Ms Forsne said:  ‘I’m willing to talk about my relationship with Francois Mitterrand. But I’ll not talk about anyone else who is close to me.’ French presidents of both left and right are well-known for their extramarital affairs. Earlier this year Francois Hollande, the first Socialist to get the job since Mitterand, split from his girlfriend, Valerie Trierweiler, after he was caught with a mistress, Julie Gayet, in January. The bachelor president has never been married, but has four children with his ecology minister, Segolene Royal.","Mr Forsne, is running for the .

The male contestants, who were travelling from Cancun after performing at the Spice Girl's pad, allegedly made so much noise on the night flight, stewards were forced to get involved. It is claimed that passengers were left disgruntled by the rowdy antics and the men 'knocking back drinks like they were going out of fashion'. Scroll down for video . Judges' houses: The male contestants allegedly made good use of the free booze on board a BA flight to the UK from Mexico after performing for Mel B . The six contestants had been banned from drinking during the six days they spent at Mel B's house - where they performed in front of the Spice Girl and sidekick Emma Bunton. However, passengers said the singers made up for it on board the British Airways flight. A passenger told The Sun: 'These boys were on a mission as soon as they got on the plane. 'They started ordering as many drinks as they could and were knocking them back like they were going out of fashion.' Cheryl Fernandez-Versini  was joined by rapper Tinie Tempah at Judges' Houses, filmed in the south of France . Bosses on the show, which pulls in 9.2 million viewers, were reported to be unhappy with the boys' behaviour - but a spokesman denied this to MailOnline Travel. A spokesman said: 'There was no bad behaviour or fracas on the flight, nor any were there any complaints from any other passengers.'

"Two French trains have collided in south west France this evening leaving at least 17 people injured, three ‘extremely seriously’. The horrific crash between a high-speed TGV and a TER regional commuter train took place close to the town of Denguin, 12 miles from Pau, on the northern edge of the Pyrenees. There were some 178 people on the TGV, which was travelling from Paris to Tarbes, and the accident took place at 5.37pm. The collision was between a regional commuter train and a TGV high speed train, similar to the one pictured (file picture) The line is extremely popular with British holidaymakers and expats who have homes in the Pyrenees area. One passenger on board told local French media: ‘The TGV slowed down and then it picked up speed. It was hit from behind by a TER which was on the same line.’ The injured were believed to be aboard the commuter train, and included a 10-month-old baby who was airlifted to hospital. The line was completely shut down and, by 8pm, dozens of firefighters and other emergency workers were at the scene. It comes a year after the Bretigny rail crash, near Paris, in which seven people died and dozens more were injured. The crash happened close to the town of Denguin, 12 miles from Pau, on the nothern edge of the Pyrenees in south west France . The 2013 crash highlighted the decaying state of France's rail network, with an official report blaming underinvestment and poor maintenance for the disaster. In a report handed over to judges, inspectors said the Bretigny derailment was caused by a faulty fishplate - a bar that links two pieces of rail together. Inspections in the area of the crash near the station of Bretigny-sur-Orge, south of Paris, also identified 100 defects. These included joints that were loose or missing. Faults had been known for up to about eight months prior to the accident but nothing was done about them. Prosecutor Eric Lallement said the main cause of the accident was a ‘shortfall in the quality of maintenance’. Hundreds of thousands of British people use the French railway network every year, with the high speed Eurostar link between Paris and London making connections extremely straightforward.","Collision was between a high-speed TGV and a regional commuter train .

"The jilted live-in girlfriend of French president Francois Hollande cost taxpayers at least £500,000 last year, it emerged today. New figures released by Paris auditors show that Valerie Trierweiler, 49, enjoyed just as much of a lavish lifestyle as her predecessor Carla Bruni, the former supermodel. As well as four bodyguards, Ms Trierweiler had five personal aides and made regular use of state planes and official homes. Publicly available costs related to Ms Trierweiler add up to £381,000, but this figure does not include the salaries of the bodyguards as well as a range of other expenses. Embarrassing: French President Francois Hollande gives ex-girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler a rose during his 2012 election campaign. New figures show the former First Lady cost the taxpayer £500,000 last year . When Mr Hollande dumped the feisty divorcee earlier this year for another lover, she moved into a luxurious state country house outside Paris with her mother and threw a party for friends. The figures will cause huge embarrassment to Mr Hollande, a Socialist who claims to dislike the rich. Until now, the left-wing Ms Trierweiler has also claimed that she cost the taxpayer very little during her 18 months as first lady of France. In a report entitled 'Spending connected with Madame Valerie Trierweiler', France's court of auditors states that all the staff positions created for her have now been closed. Figures released by Paris auditors show that Trierweiler enjoyed just as much of a lavish lifestyle as her predecessor Carla Bruni (left), the former supermodel married to ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy (right) Ms Trierweiler, who is also a member of the Socialist Party, was kicked out of the Elysee Palace after Mr Hollande was caught out sleeping with Julie Gayet, a 42-year-old actress. Mr Hollande also used taxpayers' money to conduct his affair with Mr Gayet, hopping on the back of a state moped to travel to secret liaisons with at least two bodyguards of his own. One security man was pictured delivering breakfast to the couple. The president, a bachelor who has four children with his ecology minister Segolene Royale, now has no official partner. Ms Trierweiler, who has spent most of her career working for Paris Match magazine, is now living in a flat in Paris and doing humanitarian work.","Valerie Trierweiler had bodyguards, aides and used state planes and homes .

"A campaign to help elderly people use the internet to develop passions including travel and cooking has been turned into a new documentary. Cyber Seniors follows a group of senior citizens aged between 76 and 93 as they discover the world of the Internet through the guidance of teenage mentors. The film recently premiered in Los Angeles and New York and is currently being screened across the US. The group featured in the film all had different interests, with some eager to get onto Facebook to see photos of their grandchildren and others wanting to learn how to cook or find inspiration for travelling. The film also features the elderly group competing to get the most hits for an online YouTube video. It includes 89 year-old Shura who decides to create a YouTube cooking tutorial while another member of the group, 93-year-old Marion, is shown making a rap video. The documentary, directed by Saffron Cassaday, was inspired by a campaign set up by her sisters Macaulee and Kasha five years ago. The pair began recruiting friends to visit a local retirement home twice a week to teach elderly residents how to use the Internet after witnessing first-hand how it had transformed their grandparents' lives. After learning some basic skills, their grandparents were in touch several times a week by email, Facebook and Skype. Cyber Seniors follows a group of senior citizens aged between 76 and 93 as they discover the world of the Internet through the guidance of teenage mentors . 'Our goal is to get as many seniors on the internet as possible – especially as when seniors age they can become isolated,' Macaulee Cassaday said. 'We really want to get them on the internet to stop that isolation and get then connected again.' Julia Marrocco started volunteering with the program when she was in high school. 'I'm always on the computer, so to me it was like: ""I'm doing this anyway I may as well help someone learn what everybody else is using and help them get connected into that whole world that exists out there"",' Marrocco said. 'I grew up with a computer in my house. To me a computer is as simple as picking up a pen, so having to learn how to really explain something and take your time I think is rewarding.' The group featured in the film all had different interests, with some eager to get onto Facebook to see photos of their grandchildren and others wanting to learn how to cook or find inspiration for travelling . The documentary features 89 year-old Shura, who decides to create a YouTube cooking tutorial . Ellard, 89, was originally interested in reuniting with his friends from World War II, but instead turned his interest towards reconnecting with his estranged daughter via Skype. At 76-years-old, Annette was the youngest senior of the group. She wanted to get online so she wouldn't miss out on party invites, and is also shown being introduced to online dating. The film has partnered with the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Foundation, which is also trying to encourage seniors citizens to get online. Director Saffron Cassaday said: 'I just think the internet has really changed the way that we communicate. 'In the past, senior citizens lived with their kids and grandchildren in the same house, then they lived in the same town, now we have families who are living across the world from each other. 'The rest of us adapted by staying in touch through technology, but they've kind of been left behind and left out of that. 'As they get older, they can't move around as much; they can't fly to Australia or another country to visit family members. 'The internet really does help them to reconnect with family members that they don't get to do that often.' Asked what had most surptised her about making the films, Saffron added: 'I think it taught me that you can have a lot of fun in your later years and that retirement age isn't something to be afraid of. 'I think a lot of people dread getting older and think that there's no fun to be had, and that's just not true. 'People are living way longer now and they're living healthy, happy lives. A lot of these senior citizens weren't sitting around bored. 'They're active, they're out there, they have busy schedules. It's good to know that there are things to look forward to in later life.'","Cyber Seniors is being shown across the US after premieres in LA and NYC .

"BBC sports presenter Gabby Logan yesterday insisted she acted in ‘good faith’ when investing in the same tax-avoidance scheme as Take That star Gary Barlow. The 41-year-old said she had believed she was funding new acts in the music industry when she ploughed money into Icebreaker LLP, and insisted she would pay back any money she owes HM Revenue and Customs. The firm had purported to put the cash into creative industries, but instead it moved it around to build up huge losses that wiped out large tax bills its investors would otherwise have been expected topay. Speaking out: BBC sports presenter Gabby Logan yesterday insisted she acted in 'good faith' when she ploughed money into Icebreaker LLP. She said she believed she was funding new acts in the music industry . Earlier . this month a judge ruled it was not a genuine investment scheme and that . it had been set up solely to allow the wealthy to avoid paying tax. The . scheme had about £336m invested by a number of celebrities, including . £66million from three members of Take That who could now face a tax bill . of £20million. Other . celebrities who ploughed money into the scheme included former Olympic . hurdler Colin Jackson and ex England football manager Terry Venables. Mrs Logan released a statement on her website, in which she claims that she had invested 'in good faith' and revealing . that she had not been involved in the scheme since 2012.

She said: . 'I was advised about a business opportunity 6 years ago (2008) and I . invested in good faith. It was explained to me as a way of funding new . acts in the music industry. 'Because of information which came to light in 2012, I decided the investment was not right for me.

'I have been completely open and honest with HMRC and I have never hidden anything.' Barllow, right, and band mates Mark Owen, left, and Howard Donald, centre, also put money into the controversial scheme . A tax judge ruled Icebreaker was not a genuine investment . scheme earlier this month. Instead it was found that it had been set up solely to allow the super-rich to claim . income tax relief. The ruling means Mrs Logan and the other investors could now be forced to pay back millions to HMRC. She joined an Icebreaker partnership called . Ivancroft in 2008, which claimed to be a creative industries investment scheme. Ivancroft made a loss of £11.7million. Couple: Gabby, right, is married to former Scotland rugby international Kenny Logan, left . Its real purpose was to allow its members to offset their investments against the tax they owed on their other earnings. It . is thought Barlow, 43, his bandmates Howard Donald, 46, Mark Owen, 42, . and their manager Jonathan Wild could be forced to pay £20million back . HMRC. For years, . HRMC has been trying to shut down Icebreaker Management, which claims . to invest money in the music industry for profit by producing ‘creative . and artistic material and taxable profits’. In 2012, it was revealed that the three Take That members had invested £26million into an Icebreaker partnership.It is claimed the musicians were able to avoid tax on about £63 million from world tours and CD sales.They were among nearly 1,000 people who contributed £480million to 62 partnerships.But . a tax judge found that 51 of the Icebreaker partnerships, which were . formed between 2004 and 2010, hadn’t made any profit - despite . investigating in a range of musicians. A tax judge ruled Icebreaker was not a genuine investment . scheme earlier this month. Instead it was found that it had been set up solely to allow the super-rich to claim . income tax relief. They put £66million into several Icebreaker partnerships, reportedly allowing them to shelter around £63million from the taxman. Other . well-known names who have invested in Icebreaker include retired . Olympic hurdler Colin Jackson, 47, former England football manager Terry . Venables, 71, and businessman Nick Wheeler, who is the founder of . Charles Tyrwhitt shirts. It . is thought some of the investors have told HMRC they were misled into . joining Icebreaker, and did not realise it was a tax avoidance scheme. Both Jackson and Venables have insisted their tax affairs are in order and have denied they joined Icebreaker to avoid tax. However, judge Colin Bishopp ruled Icebreaker ‘is, and was known and understood by all concerned to be, a tax avoidance scheme.’ Prime . Minister David Cameron has said he is ‘opposed to all aggressive tax . avoidance’ but refused to join calls for Barlow to be stripped of his . OBE.

"Mia Tui founder and owner Charlotte Jamme . A small company based in London is being threatened by Europe’s largest travel group over its attempts to trademark its company name. Entrepreneur Charlotte Jamme, founder and owner of handbag maker Mia Tui, said she feels 'sick to my stomach' after receiving letters from German firm TUI AG's solicitors. The travel group claims the company names are so similar that there could be confusion for consumers – even though one specialises packaged holidays and the other sells handbags and travel bags. Mrs Jamme said there is no conflict of interest and the British public is intelligent enough to know when they are buying a handbag or a holiday. She said the corporation has deep pockets and is trying to bully a small business that has just two full-time staff and trades in a completely different market. She told MailOnline Travel: ‘I just feel sick to my stomach because I know how big TUI AG is and I know how small I am. They are a major global travel company and we are a bag company. ‘You just go cold, and it’s the last thing you really want in your hands especially when I can’t afford to take legal advice.’ Mrs Jamme founded the company in Vietnam in 2010 and moved her operations to Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, in 2011, although the bags are still manufactured in Vietnam. She previously trademarked her company’s logo in 2010. ‘Mia tui’ is a Vietnamese phrase that translates to ‘my bag’ in English. Solicitors for Hanover-based TUI AG, the parent company of travel brands such as Thomson and First Choice, wrote to Mrs Jamme in August and asked her to voluntarily withdraw her application to trademark the text of her company name. After she refused, they sent a copy of a notice of opposition that has been filed with the UK Intellectual Office. Hanover-based TUI AG is a publicly traded company worth billions of pounds . The notice claims Mia Tui’s trademark is identical or similar to an earlier trademark and is being registered for identical and/or similar goods and services. Mrs Jamme applied for the trademark under Class 18, which covers products of leather and imitations of leather, including everything from suitcases and rucksacks to horse blankets and walking sticks. She said TUI AG has trademarked its name in every single classification possible, and she wants the company to prove that it trades in goods of leather or imitation leather. Handbags or holidays? Entrepreneur Charlotte Jamme says there is no confusion for consumers . Mrs Jamme said: ‘There’s no confusion at all. You’re either going to buy a holiday or buy a bag.’ She plans to oppose TUI AG’s notice and follow through with her attempt to trademark her company's name. In a statement provided to MailOnline Travel, TUI AG said it sells bags and rucksacks under its trademarked name and it is simply trying to protect its brand. The statement said: ‘TUI is continuously monitoring its registered trademarks on an international scale in order to safeguard TUI’s intellectual property rights. In doing so we merely look at trademark criteria, not at company size or other factors. ‘The only decisive factor is whether there is likelihood of confusion between the trademarks concerned. In the case under consideration, “Mia Tui”, TUI sees this fact as being applicable.’ The company said it has filed an opposition against the registration of the Mia Tui trademark because attempts to reach an ‘amicable solution’ failed. It said: ‘The decision will be purely on legal grounds. It is our only intention to protect our brand from being diluted towards our customers.’","TUI AG is opposing Mia Tui owner Charlotte Jamme's trademark application .

"Fashion week came and went quicker than you can say Cara Delevingne but it isn't just on the catwalk that new trends are born. Behind the scenes, the most talented hair and make-up artists in the world work like a well-oiled machine to set the next season's beauty trends - and if they have anything to do with it, we'll be wearing fake freckles, smudged lipstick or perhaps even no make-up at all. FEMAIL went backstage to meet the hotbed of talent conjuring up SS15's beauty looks and we can assure you that you'll be getting creative in six months' time. Scroll down for video . Bridal hair: James Pecis, L'oreal Paris' creative director, said he wanted to create something 'strikingly different' for Julien Macdonald's show so used lace cut-outs on models' hair . HAIR . Last season we welcomed the scrunchie (thanks, Cressida Bonas), but hair accessories are looking more glamorous for next summer. Julien Macdonald's show was case in point. L'Oreal Paris' James Pecis created what he calls 'mermaid hair', which was slicked back using gel, a recurring theme backstage this season. For two of Julien's models - the show's brides - James braided the lengths around the nape of the neck and attached delicate sections of lace to the crown with double-sided stick tape. Pecis said: 'We wanted something very modern and strikingly different.' Pipping Pecis in creating something different was the creative team over a Bora Asku. While most stylists went for a sleek, easy ponytail, or a graphic, urban one like TIGI by Catwalk's at KTZ, the team backstage at Bora's show transformed it into a sort of elephant's tail using black string. A variation on the ponytail: Over at Bora Asku, the classic ponytail, which was omnipresent at fashion week, was transformed into an elephant tail . Perhaps the quirkiest look of London Fashion Week was Mark Hampton's for Sophia Webster. Dubbed ‘The Cyber Twist’ and inspired by rave-wear, each model was styled as a 90s raver with twisted and knotted hair piled into bows and bunches. At PPQ, it was all about glitz and glamour and the team created a modern tiara with a centre parting and lots of glitter spray. Centre partings reigned supreme at Marios Schwab as well where TIGI by Catwalk created 'childlike' hair. Models' natural hair texture and colour shone through and was punctuated only by a precise centre parting - a style we spotted on numerous catwalks. Save it for a rave:  'The Cyber Twist' with twisted and knotted hair piled into bows and bunches was created at Sophia Webster's show . Dazzling: At PPQ, it was all about glitz and glamour and a centre parting and lots of glitter spray were the order of the day . If fiddly plaits, hair lace and glitter spray are too much for you to fathom, fear not. Plenty of stylists opted for effortless, loose waves. Our favourite style came courtesy of Toni & Guy's Hair Meets Wardrobe global hair ambassador Mark Hampton who created the ‘woodstock waves’ at Marchesa inspired by the  free spirited festival girl the collection was based around. At Matthew Williamson, he styled hair into 'the flirtatious bounce' to ooze a glamorous Seventies vibe. The look was designed to look 'undone' with voluminous waves creating a understated look that bounced along the catwalk to the cool, hip hop soundtrack. Achievable hair: Georgia May Jagger rocks the 'Woodstock waves' at Marchesa inspired by the free-spirited festival girl the collection was based around . NAILS . At Brazilian designer Mariana Jungmann's showcase, Ciate nail technician Naomi Gonsalez created metal nails inspired by Yemanja: Queen of the Ocean, a Yoruba deity. She painted nails chrome silver layered with a semi sheer finish and decorated with chain and diamente embellishments for one tough luxe look. How do you text? At Mariana Jungmann, Ciate nail technician Naomi Gonsalez created metal nails decorated with chain and diamente embellishments for one tough luxe look . X marks the spot: Nails were  rebellious and butter London technicians scrawled graphic symbols onto them . Fashion can come across oh-so-serious sometimes but we can always rely on design trio Joe Bates, Sid Bryan and Cozette McCreery to put the fun back into it. The three designers, aka Sibling, are as well known for their fun sensibility as their love of knitwear and they're beauty look followed suit. Inspired by 80s New York City style, as depicted through the lenses of acclaimed photographers Amy Arbus and Maripol, models played dress up with huge bows worn on their heads. Nails were notably rebellious and butter London technicians scrawled graphic symbols found on Tatty Devine's tribal inspired jewellery onto nails. X marks the spot. MAKE-UP . In some cases, it was a case of more is more. Backstage at Sophia Webster, Revlon created the look and it was as daring as the shoes. Taking on a Mayan masked beauty theme, the models' faces were chalked up white to create an ancient tribal feel. Eyes followed suit and were darkened with lashings of black eyeliner juxtaposed against vibrant flashes of blue, yellow, orange or purple underneath the eyes aiming to embrace each girl’s individuality. Tan counts as make-up too, especially thanks to James Read's latest product: the first-ever BB wash off tan. Who needs make-up? A model backstage at the Mariana Jungmann show can be seen wearing an ornate Face Lace by Phyllis Cohen . James created the 'hacienda tan', inspired by the Manchester raves of the 80s and 90s at Sophia's show. 'It's designed to look as though they've been at an acid house rave,' he told us backstage. 'I used lots of moisturiser to create a dewy look and used my new BB Wash Off Tan on top. It's ideal because it hides imperfections but is water-resistant and sweat-proof, perfect for those all-night raves!'. The glow giver also trialled his new product backstage at Holly Fulton, whose collection was inspired by the Eighties and Nineties - think a young Jerry Hall. 'This season's must have tan is wet-look poolside chic, glowing and glossy with an overall dewy fresh look,' added James. Topshop Beauty may have made waves when they unveiled the freckle pencil but it's going south next summer. St.Tropez sprinkled their way into the top skin finishing trends with a beachside Freckle Tan at Preen by Thornton Bregazzi. 'To tie in with the make up, we added just a breath of base colour to the body, then took the delicate dusting of freckles down from the face onto the chest, arms and legs,' said St.Tropez Global Tanning & Skin Finishing Expert, Nichola Joss. Could you pull this look off? Backstage at Sophia Webster, Revlon created the look, which took on a Mayan masked beauty theme . Eye wise, models were often seen sporting graphic, double-lined eyeliner created using masking tape (a handy trick from Sharon Dowsett). Brows are still big news - we still blame Cara Delevingne - and at Julien Macdonald they were brightened with a dust of gold eyeshadow by L'oreal Paris' Val Garland. 'It's all about washes of colour across the eyes, it's very wearable,' she told us backstage. At Hunter, ‘handsome’, bushy, groomed brows were the order of the day. While they paid lots of attention to brows, L'oreal Paris beauty buffs teamed them with flushed cheeks and glossy lids. The Joseph girl, including Sam Rollinson, rocked bold brows created by Maybelline's Sharon Dowsett who said it's important to work with what you've got. At Whistles and Temperley, brows were brushed up to create more volume. The Cara effect is still gowing strong: At Hunter, 'handsome', bushy, groomed brows were the order of the day . Berry nice: Over at Topshop Unique, while the skin was kept minimal, it was the lip that took centre stage. Here shows Jourdan Dunn and Cara Delevingne being beautified . Perhaps the biggest - and most wearable - beauty trend is berry lips. They were absolutely everywhere this season  but throw out your lip liner because it's all about the blurred lines. FEMAIL went backstage ahead of the Topshop Unique show and watched Cara and co be beautified by Topshop Beauty's mastermind make-up artist, Hannah Murray. While the skin was kept minimal, it was the lip that took centre stage. ‘Lips are effortless, with a pop of colour and a just kissed glow. The whole look is designed to look like the girls have done it themselves on the bus, they don't care if their lipstick is smudged,' said Hannah. It's easy - and purse-friendly - to do yourself at home. Use your finger to help create two textures, firstly pat on Lip Ombre in Baffle, before applying Lipstick in Temptation in the same fashion creating a deep burgundy colour on the lips. With a clean finger, smudge around the lips to achieve an intense finish with a soft diffused edge and voila, lips a la Cara. Lips were lovely over at Burberry as well. Developed by Burberry make-up artistic consultant Wendy Rowe the look featured natural, dewy skin with a huge focus on the deep ruby red lips that were slightly matte. Bold: Burberry make-up artistic consultant Wendy Rowe created dewy skin with a huge focus on the deep ruby red lips that were slightly matte at Burberry . Good news for the ladies who don't know the difference between a BB cream and a foundation because some make-up artists practically shunned make-up alltogether. Make-up maestro François Nars went for absolutely zero make-up at the Marc Jacobs show in New York, opting to spend time on skincare instead, and it seems that he brought it to London. Lucia Pieroni, using Nars Cosmetics, created a fresh faced, iridescent and luminous look at Christopher Kane and Val Garland went for a 'beautifully organic' look for Erdem. At Temperley, Lisa Eldridge  said that relaxed catwalk collections needed to be met with equally relaxed beauty. The result is bare-faced beauty that is actually extremely achievable and requires most attention on building up a healthy complexion. 'The beauty is very much skin based' says Lisa, adding 'We wanted to create sport-glossy skin that looks effortless.' When describing how to get the look Lisa explains that using a balm can help achieve the glossy look the girls had on the runway. 'We have just used tinted moisturiser and a super balm on the lips eyelids and eye brows.' Here's to a beautiful SS15.

"As one viewer put it, the BBC should have renamed Jamaica Inn, its latest big-budget period drama, ‘The Unintelligible Arms’. For hundreds who stayed in to watch it on Easter Monday night – including several actors – struggled to understand what was being said. The BBC has received more than 100 complaints over the adaptation of the novel by Daphne Du Maurier, while more than a million viewers switched off during the programme. Scroll down for video . Complaints: Viewers claimed they struggled to hear the first episode of BBC period drama Jamaica Inn when it aired on Monday evening . Bosses . blamed technical issues  – but audience members put it down to the . actors’ thick Cornish accents.

The drama, set . in 1821 against the bleak Cornish moors, follows Mary Yellan, played by . Downton Abbey star Jessica Brown Findlay, who is forced to live with her . aunt and smuggler uncle when her mother dies. Not . that viewers were any the wiser.

She said: . ‘There was no problem on the version I saw, but tonight I couldn’t hear. The director and executives were on the phone to the BBC from the off . yelling, “Why can’t we hear it?” Too late I fear. None of the production . team know what happened with the sound.

So I don’t know if it was around the country or in some areas. ‘When . we are dubbing, we always listen to it back on quite an old-fashioned . ordinary telly.

Initially . the drama attracted an audience of 6.8million. By the end, it had . fallen to 5.7million, bringing the average audience down to 6.1million.

The . latest complaints come almost a year after BBC director-general Tony . Hall suggested bosses should look at how to stop actors ‘muttering’ in . dramas.

"Hundreds more viewers have complained about the second episode of the BBC's period drama Jamaica Inn - despite the corporation pledging to fix the 'mumbling' dialogue. The BBC received 546 complaints over Monday night's opening episode, with viewers saying they had to switch on subtitles or turn the volume to maximum to hear what was being said. But despite promises that the problem would be fixed, last night's second episode drew 252 complaints so far - bringing the total to at least 798. Scroll down for video . Muddying the waters: Around 800 people have complained to the BBC about poor sound in the flagship period drama Jamaica Inn, which is based on Daphne du Maurier's classic gothic novel about the Cornish moors . Disaster: One of the BBC's flagship shows, it has lost 1.6m viewers from the first episode to the second . A BBC spokeswoman had previously apologised and said: 'We are adjusting the dialogue levels in episode two and three to address audience concerns so they can enjoy the rest of the drama and would like to apologise to those viewers who were affected.' The TV adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's classic gothic novel, starring Downton Abbey actress Jessica Brown Findlay, initially pulled in 6.1million viewers but lost 1.6million on that figure last night. Set in 1821 against the windswept Cornish moors, the three-part drama was directed by Call The Midwife's Philippa Lowthorpe and follows Mary Yellan, who is forced to live with her aunt and domineering uncle after the death of her mother. The final episode will be aired at 9pm tonight. Emma Frost, who wrote the screenplay, suggested a technical fault was to blame and not the way that the cast delivered the lines. Complaints: Viewers claimed they struggled to hear the first episode of BBC period drama Jamaica Inn when it aired on Monday evening . Blunder: Comedian Al Murray joked about the inaudible drama . The number of complaints to the BBC about Jamaica Inn has already surpassed all but one of the shows most complained about to Ofcom last year. Although Ofcom - a separate body - receives fewer complaints than the BBC does, just one programme clocked in at more than 800. The full list was: . 1. Big Brother: 9652. The X Factor: 7343. ITV News: 5744. Comic Relief: Funny for Money: 4925. Celebrity Big Brother: 4386. Britain's Got Talent: 4227. Emmerdale: 3768. BBC News: 3549. Downton Abbey: 25210. Coronation Street: 225 . MailOnline asked the BBC for a similar list of its own complaints but a spokesman said one was not available. 'No surprises here,' she wrote. 'I'm told there was a major sound problem for tonight's broadcast of Jamaica Inn - not surprised you couldn't hear it'. The total already makes the show one of the BBC's most complained-about in the last year. It is still beaten by the coverage of Nelson Mandela's death, which received more than 1,300 complaints from viewers who said the airtime given to the former ANC leader was excessive. But it is far more than the 303 who complained about the quality of the commentary at the Sochi Winter Olympics as British snowboarder Jenny Jones won a bronze medal. The complaints come almost a year after BBC director-general Tony Hall said the corporation could look at how to stop actors 'muttering' in its TV dramas. 'I don't want to sound like a grumpy old man, but I also think muttering is something we could have a look at,' he said. 'Actors muttering can be testing - you find you have missed a line... you have to remember that you have an audience.' He said that the corporation was addressing the problem of background music which made it difficult for some viewers, particularly older ones, to hear what was being said.

"Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos has posed for a series of self-taken photographs just hours after she was charged with supplying class A drugs. The star posted the photos of herself laying down wearing large headphones on Monday evening on her Instagram account, and gave each photograph a different title from the saying: 'Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil.' The star took inspiration from the modern day idiom which tries to teach people to make decisions for themselves rather than judging before all the facts are known. Number one: Tulisa started with a photo on Instagram that was captioned 'See no evil' The second picture: The singer then posted a second picture saying 'Hear no evil' with her hands near her ears .
