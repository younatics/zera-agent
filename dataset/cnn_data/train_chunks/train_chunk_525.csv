The Executioner: Heriberto Lazcano was leader of the notorious Zetas cartel and is suspected to have masterminded hundreds of killings . One of Mexico's most feared drug barons - known as The Executioner - has been killed in a gunfight with marines. Heriberto Lazcano and an accomplice died in a hail of bullets in a firefight with Mexican forces in the lawless badlands of Progreso, Coahuila, about 80 miles west of the Texas border, near Laredo. But within hours of his body being taken to a morgue, a gang of armed men stormed the building and stole his body, state prosecutors said. The former Mexican army commando was leader of the notorious Zetas cartel and is suspected to have masterminded hundreds of killings, . including the June 2004 slaying of Francisco Ortiz Franco, a top editor . of a crusading weekly newspaper in Tijuana that often reported on drug . trafficking. Lazcano, also known as 'El Verdugo' (the Executioner) for his brutality, was considered such an influential crime boss that the US government had put a $5million price on his head and Mexico an additional $2.3 million for information leading to his arrest. 'Information was obtained after the . first forensics tests were carried out that yielded indications that . suggest that one of the bodies is Heriberto Lazcano,' the navy's . statement said. The navy said it received complaints . about armed men in the area and sent out a patrol to check out the . reports. Gunmen tossed grenades at the patrol from a moving vehicle, . wounding one of the marines. His injuries were not life-threatening. Two of the gunmen were killed in the . ensuing shootout, the navy's statement said. In the gunmen's' vehicle, . authorities found a grenade launcher, 12 grenades, what appeared to be . rocket propelled grenade launcher and two rifles. The Zetas, one of Mexico's most feared cartels, were founded by former soldiers of an elite army unit, including Lazcano, who defected from the Mexican military in 1998 to work as hired guns for drug traffickers. Bullets in the dust: Lazcano was killed in the rural area of Progreso, Coahuila, about 80 miles west of the Texas border. It is known as a lawless badland where crime gangs regularly clash with heavily armed police and soldiers . They have since carved out their own . smuggling empire, expanded massively across Mexico and diversified into . kidnapping, extortion and theft of crude oil. Under Lazcano's rule, the Zetas are also responsible for some of Mexico's bloodiest massacres, biggest jail breaks and fiercest attacks on authorities. Lazcano, who is also known as 'El Verdugo' (the Executioner) for his brutality, recruited hundreds of hit men, many of them former Mexican soldiers, and hired 'kaibiles,' Guatemalan soldiers trained in counterinsurgency. Identified in the nick of time: But within hours of Heriberto Lazcano body (pictured above) being taken to a morgue, a gang of armed men stormed the building and stole his body. His body was identified just in time . In doing so he transformed what had . been a small group of assassins into a ruthless gang of enforcers for . the Gulf cartel. The Zetas also were in charge of protecting the Gulf . cartel's drug shipments. The . Zetas finally split from their former bosses in 2010 and have since . been fighting a vicious battle for control of the drug business in . northeastern Mexico, the traditional home base of the Gulf cartel. The . result has been a surge of drug-related killings. Lazcano . 'is credited with strengthening the organization ... he created a new . structure of regional cells that specialize in specific crimes,' Mexican . federal prosecutors say in their profile of Lazcano. 'El Taliban': Another leader of the Zetas cartel, Ivan Velazquez Caballero, known as ""El Taliban,"" right, was captured by Mexican marines in September. He had allegedly been fighting a bloody internal battle with Zetas' leader Trevino Morales who has a reputation for being even more brutal than Lazcano . Another Zetas boss: Salvador Escobedo, aka The Squirrel (left), was arrested on Saturday. He is accused of murdering US citizen David Hartley, pictured with wife Tiffany, who was shot in the back of the head in 2010 . The Zetas earned their notoriety for . brutality by becoming the first to publicly display their beheaded . rivals, most infamously two police officers in April 2006 in the resort . city of Acapulco. The . severed heads were found on spikes outside a government building with a . message signed 'Z' that said: 'So that you learn to respect.' Even . with the death of Lazcano, the Zetas would still be run by a ruthless . capo, Miguel Angel Trevino Morales (pictured), who has a reputation for being even . more brutal than his predecessor.

Morales, also known was 'Z-40,' has taken on a greater leadership role . and has even been reported to have replaced Lazcano as operational . chief. The report of Lazcano's death came just hours after the navy nabbed a suspected Zetas regional leader accused of involvement in some of the country's most notorious crimes in recent years. Navy spokesman Jose Luis Vergara said Salvador Alfonso Martinez Escobedo was arrested on Saturday in Nuevo Laredo, across from Laredo, Texas. The official said Martinez is believed to have masterminded the massacre of 72 migrants in the northern state of Tamaulipas in 2010. The man known as 'Squirrel' also has been linked to the escape of 151 prisoners in 2010 from a jail in the city of Nuevo Laredo, the recent flight of 131 prisoners in the city of Piedras Negras and the killing of U.S. citizen David Hartley in 2010 on Falcon Lake, which straddles the U.S.-Mexico border. The death of Hartley drew wide attention as it appeared Hartley and his wife, Tiffany, were on a personal trip when he was shot by Mexican criminals on Sept. 30, 2010. The Hartleys were using personal watercraft on Falcon Lake when David Hartley was shot in the head and fell into the water. The navy is also blaming Martinez for the killing of the Tamaulipas state police commander and chief investigator on the case, an attack that hampered the investigation. The navy said Martinez is also a suspect in dozens of killings of people who were buried in mass graves at the same site of the 2010 massacre of migrants. Nearly 200 bodies were discovered in April 2011 in the town of San Fernando, close to the U.S. border. Those two crimes have been the most fatalities since Mexico's federal government launched an armed offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.","Heriberto Lazcano was leader of the notorious Zetas cartel and is suspected to have masterminded hundreds of killings .

Claims: John Humphrys has caused controversy by saying that some of the alleged abuse by Savile was 'banter' Veteran Radio 4 presenter John Humphrys has today been accused of 'trivialising' alleged abuse by Sir Jimmy Savile - after claiming that some of it was just 'banter'. In a heated interview with Labour's Deputy Leader Harriet Harman he also denied that some victims had suffered 'serious sexual abuse'. Mr Humphrys added that the BBC has been drawn into a 'witchhunt' over the issue. Reacting to his 'banter' comment Ms Harman said: 'We’re talking about serious sexual assault here'. Humphrys then responded: 'Well we’re not always though, are we? In some cases girls are talking about him putting his hand on their leg. 'That’s not the sort of behaviour we should accept. Nonetheless, in many cases, it’s not serious sexual assault. 'There is a danger of a witchhunt here,' he added, saying that it is very important there is an independent inquiry into what Savile may have done while at the BBC. Peter Saunders, from the National . Association of People Abused in Childhood, said: 'These comments . perpetuate the myth that abuse isn’t a big deal. This is a serious issue . and he’s trivialising it.' Defending the presenter, a BBC spokesman said: 'John challenged Harriet Harman on the reasons behind her call for an inquiry but he was clear that serious allegations have been made, and he did not trivialise them.' It came as another woman claimed Jimmy Savile abused her on a cruise as a 16-year-old when he promised her an autograph if she came to his cabin. Sue Southgate was with her friend in his room when he took off his trousers in front of them on the P&O ship SS Canberra, and then pulled her onto his bed for a 'quick cuddle'. Allegations: Mr Humphrys also said the BBC could be a victim of a 'witchhunt' and there should be a independent inquiry into what Savile did at the corporation . This was despite her friend having a camera - he was 51 at the time. 'At one point he slipped out of his pants and started rubbing himself up against me. I could feel that he was excited,' she told The Sun. 'He grasped me very tightly in his arms and told me to do the same to him. 'He said,""This is a special move that will help you stop the boys getting away"".' Mrs Southgate, now 51, spoke out days after it was revealed that he was later asked to leave the liner because he targeted a 14-year-old. She added that she was shocked and ran away because she had innocently believed he was the 'harmless' man that people loved on TV. Instead, she said, she knew if she hadn't fled she would have been forced to have sex with him. Claim: Savile has been accused of abusing a 16-year-old on a cruise to Gibraltar, pictured, by luring her back to his room with the promise of an autograph . Thrown off: Savile was locked in his room of the SS Canberra after targeting a 14-year-old . The captain, who asked not to be named said of his decision to remove Savile: 'The more I quizzed him, the more convinced I became that he was lying. 'He was a shifty sort of chap whose eyes darted all over the place. 'The parents, who were not travelling first class, were very decent, ordinary people who were completely scandalised by Savile’s unwanted attention to their daughter. I told him he disgusted me and I wanted him off my ship when we reached Gibraltar. 'I detailed an officer to make sure he remained in his cabin until we reached the Rock. 'He was to take all his meals in his cabin and was not allowed to leave it under any circumstances short of shipwreck.'","In an interview with Labour Deputy Leader Harriet Harman he also said not all victims suffered 'serious sexual abuse'

A teenage father who was trying to act as a 'peacemaker' in a late-night brawl has been left wheelchair-bound from a single punch which caused 'catastrophic' injuries. Callum Bowling, 18, whose daughter Grace was born just six weeks earlier, needs further surgery to reconstruct his skull after the attack in Bolton town centre. Tom Cooper, also aged 18, was jailed for 27 months after landing a solitary blow, which knocked Mr Bowling to the ground where his head hit the floor with 'very considerable impact'. Callum Bowling, 18, outside Bolton Crown Court with, from back left, mother Katherine Bowling, aunt Sharon Bowling, cousin Kelsey Ashbarry and fiancee Bethany Sutton . His victim was left with a catalogue . of injuries including post-traumatic amnesia, epilepsy, poor memory and . concentration, personality changes and behavioural problems. Mr Bowling is no longer able to live with his fiancee because of his injuries, Bolton Crown Court heard on Monday. Cooper, of Little Hulton, was jailed for causing grievous bodily harm. The court heard how he hit Mr Bowling with a 'very forceful' blow on March 3 this year. Saul Brody, prosecuting, told the court Mr Bowling, from Westhoughton, and Cooper had been in Bolton town centre with their separate groups of friends when a dispute broke out in the early hours of the morning. Mr Bowling tried to act as a 'peacemaker' but Cooper punched him, and he fell to the ground. He was rushed to Royal Bolton Hospital for treatment, where he was unconscious and put on a ventilator. Tom Cooper was jailed for 27 months at Bolton Crown Court yesterday after a single punch in a late night brawl left Callum Bowling in a wheelchair . The young dad suffered bleeding on the brain and was transferred to Salford Royal Hospital for emergency surgery. Mr Bowling, who used to live with his fiancee but now lives with his mother who cares for him, was discharged from hospital after two months but his condition deteriorated further, and he had issues with swallowing, balance and seizures. The court heard his treatment is ongoing and he will need further surgery to reconstruct his skull. Andrew McLoughlin, defending, told the court Cooper realised he would be jailed for the attack. He added: 'He offers his sincere apologies to the family of Callum Bowling, and Callum Bowling himself, for the consequences caused and the ongoing consequences.' Sentencing, Judge Maureen Roddy said: 'I know whatever sentence I impose is not going to restore your victim’s health. I know that whatever sentence I impose, his family are likely to think it doesn’t fit the crime, but there are rules and sentencing has to be within those rules. 'He has suffered in his physical, mental and psycho-social health. He will never be the young man he was. His mother will not have the son she had. 'His daughter, who was only weeks old at the time, will not have the father she expected to have. 'The consequences of your act that night have been truly catastrophic for that family.' The judge also paid tribute to Mr Bowling’s mother, Katherine. She urged her to seek support, after being told she had received no help or compensation to help care for her son. Outside court, Mr Bowling’s fiancee, Beth Sutton, said: 'Grace hasn’t got a dad now. He can’t even pick her up. He can’t feed her or change her nappy. He loves her to pieces and it kills him not to be a dad.' Bolton Crown Court, where Tom Cooper was jailed for 27 months for Grevious Bodily Harm on Monday .

Photographer Adri De Visser, 50, captured this fascinating display of nature in its purest beauty at every stage. The lioness first stares at the calf in shock, before roaring angrily at it to make it go away. Finally, her maternal instincts take over, and after batting the quivering calf with a paw, she picks up the orphaned baby and carries it off like one of her own cubs.

It went between its legs like it was trying to get its milk. 'The lioness was really confused and they stood there for around 45 minutes. 'Then a park ranger turned up on his motorbike which made a really loud noise, which I think frightened the animals.

A map of the human body that lists the value of each body part; a map of the U.S. that marks the most popular surnames; and a graphic that shows what plot details make a great novel. These were just three of the entries at the Information Is Beautiful Awards ceremony in London last week, celebrating the most ingenious methods of making numbers and facts visually interesting. The body parts map provides the price in sterling for every limb, organ and gland based on the growing industry of human tissue recovery. The researchers calculated the values from prices charged by human tissue recovery agencies that collect body parts for research. Because you're worth it: A body parts map designed by Peter Grundy that was nominated at the Information Is Beautiful Awards ceremony at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London last week . The most expensive individual part is the pituitary gland at the base of the brain, which is valued at £2,085. Known as the ‘master gland’, the pituitary controls hormones and functions as the body’s thermostat. If you could do away with your brain altogether, expect to be paid £10,707 for all its parts. The colourful ‘info graphic’ map, entitled Body Parts: What Are You Worth and designed by Peter Grundy, was nominated at the Information Is Beautiful Awards ceremony at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA). Other high value parts are the small intestine, worth £1,576, and a pair of human testicles, worth £1,526. If you can spare your penis, expect to be paid £763 - the same value as a gallbladder - while your stomach will fetch just £318. Some spare knee cartilage will net £811, lungs are valued at £736 and both eyes are worth just £954. Surprisingly the heart is worth a middling £763, according to the graphic. The least lucrative body part is a gold tooth - worth just £1. Popular names: This detailed graphic shows the predominant surnames in each U.S. state in map form . The nominees for this year's Booker Prize are broken down by genre to find out what makes a great novel. Perhaps unsurprisingly, death is the most common plot device . An annotation on the diagram says: 'Today’s scientists have rejected grave robbing in favour of human tissue recovery agencies, companies that collect and supply body parts for research. 'Since the UK’s Human Tissue Act 2004 clarified the law, tissue recovery has become a lucrative and (mostly) legitimate industry, turning over millions of pounds a year.' Human tissue recovery turns body parts into profit by making everything from dental implants to bladder slings. It is a big growth industry, especially in the U.S. and Eastern Europe.

And next year it will gain 70,000 new followers as all London Olympics volunteers will be kitted out in a 'regal purple' and 'poppy red' jacket. Sparking a trend: Cheryl Cole's orange and purple outfit, which she wore in May, may have inspired the London Olympics volunteer's uniforms . The uniforms, which will be worn by 'Games Makers' at the London 2012 Games, were unveiled yesterday . They were created by a London 2012 and adidas design team and are apparently a throwback to the historic Grenadier Guards uniform - note the epaulettes and the buttons on the sleeves. Classic British sporting events such as the London 1948 Games, Wimbledon tennis championships and the Henley Regatta provided additional inspiration. But the design team also seem to have taken into account the latest fashion trends. London 2012 chief executive Paul . Deighton said of the volunteers: 'They will be high profile in London and in our venues . across the UK at Games time and so it's important they look the part.' The jacket has a turn-back feature to suit different arm lengths and different-coloured epaulettes will . identify specific groups, with white for medical staff, red for team . leaders and green for anti-doping personnel.

Much like models, professional ballerinas famously face low wages, early retirement, constant risk of injury and most notably, a tyranny of thin. However, a new book which highlights the dance industry's morally objectionable practices also reveals how it is changing for the better, with ballerinas today allowed to be curvier than they have been in nearly 50 years. Deirdre Kelly, the author behind Ballerina: Sex, Scandal, and Suffering Behind the Symbol of Perfection, says ballet 'is literally fattening up,' overcoming a history of eating disorders that for years have gone unchecked 'for the sake of art and beauty'. Symbol of perfection: A new book which highlights the dance industry's morally objectionable practices also reveals how ballerinas today are allowed to be curvier than they have been in nearly 50 years . 'Ballerinas are today allowed to be curvier than they have been since 1963,' Ms Kelly, a ballet critic and mother to a nine-year-old ballerina, wrote in a blog for the Huffington Post. She continued: 'When [George] Balanchine was granted the lucrative Ford Foundation grant, [it] allowed him to create ballet in his own vision - that is populated by long, lean, leggy ballerinas such as he had known and bedded in St. Petersburg.' Mr Balanchine was one of the 20th . century's most famous choreographers, a Russian-born developer of ballet . in the U.S. and the co-founder of New York City Ballet, who, Ms Kelly . said, 'institutionalized starvation' through his 'thin ideal,' since 1963 until his death 20 years later. Changing face of ballet: A ballerina in the Twenties (left) before George Balanchine popularized as ideal of extreme thinness; now, ballerinas are starting to move away from the tyranny of thin . However, since the Seventies, when 'Balanchine-inspired eating disorders first started decimating the ballerina population' and after the choreographer's death in 1983, medical experts have continued to determine that the ballet industry's 'tyranny of thin' has detrimental effects on dancers' health and well-being. 'Ballet has tended to make victims of the very women it looks to idolize on the stage,' she said. '[But] ballerinas today are again embracing . the breasts and hips which first made them objects of desire way back in . the day. Sixties prima ballerina: From 1963, long, lean, leggy ballerinas been the ideal shape for dancers, which according to Ms Kelly, is starting to change . 'They are turning their backs on the radical cosmetic surgeries . and punitive dieting that stripped them of their identities as . full-fledged women in the modern era.' The Australian Ballet is one of the many dance companies that now prioritize injury prevention. By positively changing how they train dancers, ballerinas are encouraged to speak up about their physical or emotional weaknesses. Ballerina: Deirdre Kelly, author of Ballerina: Sex, Scandal, and Suffering Behind the Symbol of Perfection, says ballet 'is literally fattening up' Despite knowing the 'dangers lurking in the shadows of ballet,' the author said she encourages her own daughter to take twice-weekly ballet classes because she still believes it is 'a sublimely beautiful art form - the feminine mystique personified.' 'It is an outlet for female strength and autonomy. It is where women artists can lead and dominate. Where the ballerina is in control of her body in determining her own destiny,' she added.","Ballet critic Deirdre Kelly is the author of a new book, Ballerina: Sex, Scandal, and Suffering Behind the Symbol of Perfection .

As he splashed into a pond full of geese, this hungry fox no doubt thought he was in for an easy lunch. But he had chosen the wrong flock for that. The brave birds banded together – and outfoxed him. The Canada geese even recruited passing ducks, coots, moorhens and cormorants for their cunning plan. Outnumbered: As the fox wades through the water looking for an easy meal, the geese surround him . They ganged up on the would-be predator to prevent him picking them off one by one and followed him along the pond. Eventually, the fox gave up and returned to dry land still hungry and probably rather baffled. The encounter was photographed by a visitor at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust Centre in Barnes, south-west London. Safety in numbers: Other birds join in to defend themselves and their offspring . A spokesman for the centre said: ‘They will be used to seeing foxes and have developed strategies to deal with their presence and protect themselves. It is typical behaviour in the wild but rarely seen. These are fascinating pictures.’ Tim Webb, of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said it was an example of ‘mobbing’, a form of behaviour that birds engage in to defend themselves or their offspring from predators. They aim to divert a predator’s attention through their behaviour and to blow its cover, thus reducing its chances of success. Better luck next time: Defeated, the fox begins slink away . Although more commonly associated with crows and gulls swooping in flight at their target, it is common among many species of birds and can take place on land or on water. Mr Webb said: ‘It’s instinctive behaviour. At first, the birds will have acted out of fear for their young, but they will have become emboldened by the number of birds that were there and acted as a group. ‘Normally mobbing involves one species. What is quite unusual here is that they are all joining together to defend themselves against a fox coming into their patch – it’s like an avian . Neighbourhood Watch. They are being intimidating by patrolling up and down wherever the fox goes.’","The encounter was photographed by a visitor at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust Centre in Barnes, south-west London ."

This prevents him from playing outside with his friends, going on holiday and eating cold food. Aidan has even had a reaction in the heat of Spain because the cold sweat his body produced was colder than his core temperature. He said: 'I can’t play outside the house with friends and it makes me sad. When it’s cold my mum won’t let me out in the cold and that makes me upset.

The primary school pupil comes out in hives, or skin rash, if he comes in to contact with conditions below his body temperature . Aidan added: 'I love swimming but can’t do it because of the cold. 'It would make me feel better if I was able to swim, but we can’t find anywhere to go.' Aidan was diagnosed with the condition four years ago when his mother, Melissa, took Aidan to Blackpool Air Show and noticed he had suffered an allergic reaction from a light breeze. She now has to carry special auto-injector - or Epi-pen - with her which delivers a dose of epinephrine or adrenaline to avoid or treat the onset of anaphylactic shock. The 32-year-old said: 'He can’t live a normal life. 'It really upsets me but there’s nothing we can do about it, so we just try to make things as fun as possible when we go out. It’s really difficult for him because he can’t go outside and he thinks he has done something wrong when he can’t play with his friends just because it’s a bit cold.' Aidan has seen 20 specialists about his condition since his diagnosis. He is also the youngest known person to have the illness in the UK, which is more commonly found in men aged 18 to 24 years old. His mother added: 'It can just be a little breeze in the summer that causes a reaction. He has asthma as well which means it can sometimes be difficult to tell whether he is having an asthma attack or an allergic reaction. He can’t have ice lollies or ice cream and has to brush his teeth with warm water.' Dr Walter Bottomley, Aidan’s consultant dermatologist at Lytham’s Clifton Hospital for the last three years, said: 'Some people have it in a relatively mild or severe form, but we aren’t unfamiliar with it. 'Unfortunately the treatment we have for urticarias isn’t particularly good and the best treatment is to stay out of the cold. 'All I can say is that it seems to go in most people, but you can’t predict how long it’s going to last and you don’t come across adults who have had it all their lives. 'It will go in the end but with some people it takes weeks, sometimes months or even years if they are unlucky, so he has been unfortunate.'","Aiden Smith is the youngest person with the rare condition in the UK .

Lighty, who had managed Sean 'Diddy' combs, L.L. Cool J and Missy Elliott among others, died on August 30 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head after he reportedly argued with his wife at his home in the affluent Bronx, New York neighborhood of Riverdale. The New York Medical Examiner has ruled the death a suicide but Lighty's family is suspicious of the circumstances leading up to his death and have asked the Grammy winner to pay for the inquiry. Mourning: 50 Cent leaves the funeral service for producer Chris Lighty in New York City on September 5 . 50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis James Jackson III, told WNYW-TV on Monday he can't believe that Lighty would have killed himself because the music exec, who started Violator record label and management company, was set to rake in millions of dollars for a 50 Cent tour he had just booked for 2013. 'To be honest with you, there was too much planning to move forward to accept right away that he just shot himself,' the rapper told the local news station. Lighty's wife Veronica, was named as the primary beneficiary and executor of Lighty's will. Lighty's children will also benefit through a $1.6 million trust. 'It’s a world divided. Even at the funeral, Veronica sat on one side in the front with her kids and her family, and the Lighty family was on the other,' sources told the New York Post's Page Six about the hostility between his family and widow. 'A lot of people want answers; a lot of things don’t really add up,' another source said. Surprised: 50 Cent spoke out on Monday about his shock over Chris Lighty's death . Veronica married the music manager in 2003 and they had two children together. But the couple's relationship was said to be rocky and she filed for divorce in 2011 but later retracted papers to dissolve the marriage. After her husband's death, the 36-year-old intimated that her husband owed the IRS money, through a friend speaking to the press on her behalf, and maintained that she and her husband had not been fighting in the lead up to his death. 'No smart man is going to leave his children for fighting with his wife,' she told the New York Daily News in early September. 'We had a passionate relationship. We fought all the time,' urging people to leave the matter alone, 'let him die proud, at peace.' Tragic death: Chris Lighty with his wife Veronica, at Kanye West's 30th birthday five years ago; he shot himself after the pair argued on August 30 . On the afternoon of Saturday, August 30, Lighty allegedly walked into the backyard of his Riverdale home after he had been arguing with Veronica, only stating, 'I'm tired of this.' He then shot himself with a 9-mm. handgun, sources said. But Lighty's family is pushing for more information on what contributed to his death and even commissioned a second autopsy, conducted by former New York medical examiner Dr. Michael Baden. He said the results from his examination are still inconclusive. 'In my opinion, the cause of death was clear as a gunshot wound to the head. The manner of death, acts of suicide or homicide, still is pending until all those tests are done,' he told the New York TV station. Music exec: Chris Lighty had worked with Sean 'Diddy' Combs (left) in addition to Russell Simmons (right). Both hip hop moguls attended Lighty's funeral on September 5 in New York . In addition to the autopsy, Lighty's mother approached 50 Cent about organizing a deeper  investigation into the shocking death. She hired lawyer Scott Leemon and private investigator Les Levine to oversee the probe. 'The . investigation is being led by private investigator Les Levine and is . in its’ extreme early stages. It is being initially funded by 50 Cent . with the hope of others helping,' Scott E. Leemon told . AllHipHop.com about the case. Grieving: Fans and friends of the mogul gathered in the street where he was found dead in Riverdale . The rapper said he felt he needed to do all he could to help the family through this difficult time. 'I couldn't tell her no. She kind of needed closure. There were so many gray areas,' 50 Cent said about his contribution. The . 37-year-old entertainer had worked closely with Lighty throughout his . career and was credited with helping orchestrate 50 Cent's highly . lucrative endorsement deal with Vitamin Water. 'He's been a part of everything that I can make reference as a successful moment for me,' he said of Lighty.

The benefits of breast cancer screening programmes far outweigh the risks, according to research. Screening saves thousands of lives - even though it also results in many women wrongly being told they have tumours. All women aged 50 to 70 are offered breast X-rays, or mammograms, for free on the NHS every three years. Effective: The benefits of breast cancer screening programmes far outweigh the risks, according to researchers . But recently the effectiveness of this screening program has been called into question, with several high-profile scientists claiming they cause more harm than good. Now a study has concluded that the benefits of the X-rays far outweigh the risks - which can include healthy patients needlessly having to undergo distressing surgery or chemotherapy. Scientists from Queen Mary University, London, calculate for that for every 1,000 women having regular screening for 20 years, nine lives will be saved. Around 1.6million women regularly go for the X-rays in Britain so this works out as 14,400 lives being saved over two decades. But the academics also calculate that out of the same 1,000 women having screening, four would be wrongly diagnosed and possibly made to have breasts removed or chemotherapy. Only last month, two prominent American academics accused one of the world’s biggest breast cancer charity of ‘duping’ women by overselling the benefits of scans. The Department of Health is currently overseeing an independent review into the NHS screening program and the results are expected to be published later in the autumn. This particular study, published in the Journal of Medical Screening, looked at existing research involving five million women from various European countries. It concluded that for every two women saved by the scans, one would be wrongly diagnosed. Professor Stephen Duffy, of the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine at Barts and The London School of Medicine & Dentistry, part of Queen Mary, University of London, said: ‘This is the only comprehensive review of the results of breast screening services in Europe. ‘It reports results from screening millions of women, and confirms that the screening services are delivering the benefits expected from the research studies conducted years ago. 'In particular, it is good news that lives saved by screening outweigh over-diagnosed cases by a factor of two to one.’ In a joint statement responding to the research, Chris Askew of Breakthrough Breast Cancer and Baroness Delyth Morgan of Breast Cancer Campaign, said: ‘This hugely detailed, impressive piece of work supports the widely held view that breast screening saves lives by helping to detect breast cancer early. ‘In England, an independent panel is conducting its own review of all the evidence underpinning the breast screening programme. We hope it will provide further clarity to women on the effectiveness of the breast screening programme.’ Last month Professor Lisa Schwartz and Steven Woloshin of the U.S. Center for Medicine and the Media at The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice accused a charity of giving women false hope over screening. They claimed the charity, called Susan G Komen for the Cure, was using ‘Oscar-winning’ tactics to dupe women into having the X-rays.","Screening saves thousands of lives - but also results in many women wrongly being told they have tumours .

Live pipe organ music is evocative of old Hollywood glamour and silent movies, but has long been absent from British cinemas, until now. The only Wurlitzer organ in a working cinema in Europe has made its debut after a painstaking five-year restoration, much to the delight of cinema goers. Enthusiasts from across the country descended on the Royalty Cinema in Bowness-on-Windermere, Cumbria, at the weekend to witness a piece of history. Scroll down for video . Iconic: The only Wurlitzer organ in a working cinema was lovingly restored in a process that spanned five years . Pride of place: The organ is lit up beside the screen as guests at the opening ceremony enjoyed the silent film Safety Last, accompanied by Mr Ivory on the organ . The organ was originally at a theatre in Ohio but was shipped to the UK in 1934 when ‘talkies’ ended the era of silent films in the USA. It was used occasionally at the Rex cinema in East London until the 1970s. Mayor of Windermere Allan Winrow cut the ribbon at the weekend to unveil the instrument. Mark Latimer, who launched the restoration, said: 'At some points I never thought we would get this far, so it’s tremendous to see it playing - it sounds fantastic. 'People have come here from the south coast to Scotland and everywhere in between.' Visitors were treated to an afternoon concert featuring organists Chris Powell, David Ivory and David Shepherd. Organs took the place of orchestras in the heyday of silent films, designed to produce many different sounds and timbres using the fewest number of pipes to minimise the space needed. The restored Wurlitzer has the traditional horse-shoe shaped console and sits in pride of place on the right hand side of the screen at the Royalty cinema. Nostalgic: Mr Ivory played the same organ over 40 years ago at the East London bingo hall, and said the event in Cumbria had brought back memories for him . Tickling the ivories: David Shepherd entertained guests on the pipe organ that produces a surprising variety of sounds, including that of a siren . Describing the opening event as ‘fantastic’, Alan Adams, of Barrow, said: 'I could have listened to the organ for hours. 'It was so good and it’s wonderful to see the organ being used. I am glad I came.' The celebration continued with an evening showing of silent film Safety Last, accompanied by Mr Ivory on the organ. He said being involved brought back some memories for him. 'I played this very same organ 40 years ago so it’s nostalgic for me - I used to play it in an East London bingo hall. I’d entertain the ladies before bingo so it’s nice to be playing it again.' Piece of history: The performance of David Ivory (pictured) and the other organists, was the first time many of the cinema enthusiasts would have heard the organ live . There were also shorter films to start the cinema evening, which included the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy and Buster Keaton, with Paul Gregson at the keyboard. One of those chuckling at the comedians, John Simpson, from Lancaster, said: 'This is the first time I have seen a Wurlitzer in action so I was very excited. I’ve heard them on CDs but nothing compares to seeing it live. 'Everyone has been laughing so it must be good, and the organists are so talented.' Alan Mason, of Barrow, who attended the concert and film show, said: 'The concert was very good and I am surprised at how many people turned up. 'I’ve seen the organ over the years so it’s lovely to come and see it being played, especially in a setting like this because there are not many vintage cinemas about.'","Instrument was originally used in a theatre in Ohio, USA .

Invariably though, even with the fastest responding digital cameras, cherished moments often pass before they can be pictured. That said, it is questionable whether you would want a camera attached to you snapping virtually every moment of your life and transmitting the pictures to the internet where they will be stored forever. In case you do, however, a Swedish tech startup has developed just such a device, and the service to go with it. Good idea or bad idea? The tiny Memoto camera clips to your clothes and takes pictures every 30 seconds - capturing moments of your life that would otherwise be lost to fading memories . Discreet: Though it is just the size of a postage stamp, the Memoto incorporates a five-megapixel camera and GPS unit that geotags all the pictures it takes . Roughly the size of a postage stamp, the Memoto camera attaches discreetly to your clothes and automatically snaps geo-tagged photos - so no memory of your daily life is ever forgotten. It has no buttons, but automatically captures the scene - and records the user's location - every 30 seconds before uploading the tagged images to the internet for review later. Potentially the device gives users the chance to rediscover photos they never even knew were taken, capturing the moment, for example, when you first saw your future love or your baby flash a gummy grin. Measuring just 26 x 26 x 9mm, the Memoto still manages to incorporate a five-megapixel camera and a battery that will keep snapping for about two days before needing a recharge. Jogging memories: The Memoto will automatically snap every dog and tree you pass . Ping pong memories: Never again will an epic rally be lost to misty memories . Privacy concerns: The team behind Memoto promise that pictures uploaded to their servers will be encrypted and visible only the the user . To replenish the camera's power, users need simply to connect it to their computer; at the same time the device automatically uploads the pictures to Memoto's servers where they are catalogued accoring to date, time, location and even lighting conditions. Photos can then be searched and shared through the company's web service or with the aid of a Memoto app which is scheduled for release on both iPhone and Android platforms. Though some may be uncomfortable with loading images of their entire life to the cloud, with the camera generating 4GB of data a day - a phenomenal 1.5 terabytes a year - there really is no other practical storage option. To assuage privacy concerns Memoto's team promises they will remain private by default, encypted and only visible to the user. The team behind the Memoto are looking for funding to realise their project through Kickstarter. So far they have received about half their hoped for $150,000 dollars to bring the product to market and hope to put it on sale by 2013. 'Many fantastic and special moments become blurred together after a while and it feels like life just rushes by, too fast for us to grasp,' they say. 'We at Memoto wanted to find a way to relive more of our lives in the future - and enjoy the present as it happens.'",The Memoto camera clips to your clothes and takes pictures every 30 seconds throughout the day .

Scientists even hope some of the humanoid designs will one day compete - and beat - humans in football matches. In the palm of his hand: The iCub robot, modelled on a three-year-old child, is among a new generation of humanoids which are being designed in Bristol and Essex to performed complex tasks like humans . Apple of their eye: Ambitious scientists hope one day their robots will rescue us, become our friends and clear our sewers . Some can walk, talk and dance, speak 20 languages, hold conversations and respond with life-like expressions. The BERT2 humanoid can interact with humans using an expressive face and artificial hands. Theoretically, it could be controlled from anywhere in the world and so could be the forerunner of a robotic surgeon performing remote operations around the globe. Others have been inspired by nature and can swim like fish or mimic the flight of birds and insects.

The Robotic Fish, which has the 'natural speed and motion of a large carp', can operate autonomously and is designed to monitor water pollution and detect leaks from ships in harbour. Dr Ioannis Ieropoulos, senior researcher at the Bristol Robotic Laboratory, said the scientists had looked to nature for inspiration. 'Natural systems demonstrate perfectly that most of the difficult engineering problems have already been solved,' he said.

A spinoff from robotic space technology may someday help astronauts stay fit in space and help paraplegics walk on Earth, Nasa says. The U.S. space agency and the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC) have jointly developed a robotic exoskeleton called X1. The 57lb device is a robot that a human could wear over his or her body either to assist or inhibit movement in leg joints. Scroll down for video . Dual use: The X1 exoskeleton, currently in development, could help astronauts exercise in space and paraplegics walk on Earth. It is based on the technology behind Robonaut 2, the first humanoid robot in space . In the inhibit mode, the X1 exoskeleton would be used as an in-space exercise machine to supply resistance against leg movement. The same technology could be used in reverse on the ground, potentially helping some individuals walk for the first time. The X1 is based on the technology behind Robonaut 2, the first humanoid robot in space, which is currently working with astronauts aboard the International Space Station. 'Robotics is playing a key role aboard the International Space Station and will be critical in our future human exploration of deep space,' said Michael Gazarik, director of Nasa's Space Technology Program. 'What's extraordinary about space technology and our work with projects like Robonaut are the unexpected possibilities space tech spinoffs may have right here on Earth. 'It's exciting to see a Nasa-developed technology might one day help people with serious ambulatory needs to begin to walk again, or even walk for the first time. 'That's the sort of return on investment Nasa is proud to give back to America and the world.' Nasa's Robonaut 2 aboard the International Space Station: The technology for the X1 exoskeleton was adapted from the Robonaut project . From the waist up, 27-year-old Sophie Morgan is every inch the pretty blonde girl-next-door. But from the waist down, with her legs encased in £90,000 of motorised carbon-fibre, she is RoboCop. Sophie’s thumb manipulates a joystick built into the armrests of her suit, causing the legs to hiss and whirr into life, before she takes three slow but sure steps. Her face breaks into a broad grin. Nasa's X1 prototype is not the only exoskeleton in development that could help disabled people walk again. Sophie is one of the first people in the world to benefit from a robotic exoskeleton called Rex. Once in, the only movement needed is the strength to operate a small joystick, which instructs 29 micro-controllers within the machine to react within milliseconds. The user can move in all directions, sit down, and ascend and descend stairs. It is this technology that will, arguably, mark the end of the wheelchair. But as yet there are currently just ten in existence and only 30 people have tried Rex. Rex weighs nearly 6st and is relatively bulky, yet experts predict that within the next few decades the devices will be small and light enough to slip on under a pair of jeans. Worn over the legs, with a harness . that reaches up the back and around the shoulders, X1 has four motorised . joints at the hips and the knees, and six passive joints that allow for . sidestepping, turning and pointing, and flexing a foot. There also are multiple adjustment points, allowing the X1 to be used in many different ways. Nasa is examining the potential for the X1 as an exercise device to improve crew health both aboard the space station and during future long-duration missions to an asteroid or Mars. Without taking up valuable space or weight during missions, X1 could replicate common crew exercises, which are vital to keeping astronauts healthy in zero gravity. In addition, the device has the ability to measure, record and stream back data in real-time to flight controllers on Earth, giving doctors better insight into the crew's exercise. X1 could also provide a robotic power boost to astronauts as they work on the surface of distant planetary bodies. Coupled with a spacesuit, X1 could provide additional force when needed during surface exploration. Here on Earth, IHMC is interested in developing and using X1 as an assistive walking device. It has the potential to produce high torques to allow for assisted walking over varied terrain, as well as stair climbing. 'We greatly value our collaboration with Nasa,' said Ken Ford, IHMC's director and CEO. 'The X1's high-performance capabilities will enable IHMC to continue performing cutting-edge research in mobility assistance and expand into rehabilitation.' The potential of X1 extends to other applications, including rehabilitation, gait modification and offloading large amounts of weight from the wearer. Preliminary studies by IHMC have already shown X1 to be more comfortable, easier to adjust, and easier to put on than older exoskeleton devices. Researchers now plan on improving on the X1 design by adding more active joints to areas such as the ankle and hip to increase the potential uses for the device.","The X1 is based on the technology behind the Robonaut 2, which is now working with astronauts aboard the International Space Station ."

When a couple divorce, a row over who gets the family home, pets or even the record collection is to be expected. But for Maha Shagroon and her billionaire ex-husband Adnan Sharbatly, the stakes are a little higher. She claims he has breached their . divorce settlement by failing to maintain her two luxury homes, cutting . her number of servants and refusing to pay her head chef’s salary. Now she is demanding her Saudi . Arabian ex increases her maintenance payments, improves their £5million . London mansion and replaces her fleet of cars every three years. Mr Sharbatly, 66, married Mrs . Shagroon, 47, at London’s Intercontinental Hotel in 1994 in an Islamic . ceremony presided over by an imam. They were together for seven years . and had three children but the relationship broke down in 2001, leading . to acrimonious divorce proceedings. Their differences appeared to have . been resolved by a ‘compromise’ hammered out in 2002, which made . financial provision for Mrs Shagroon. It also guaranteed her home in . Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, would be well maintained, allowed her the run of . the couple’s Regent’s Park mansion in the summer and agreed some of her . staff costs would be paid. The luxurious Regent's Park property that Mrs Shagroon uses when in London . But the Court of Appeal heard a list . of complaints from Mrs Shagroon including claims Mr Sharbatly had not . dealt with septic tank leaks or maintained the air conditioning at her . Jeddah home.

He added that she had estimated her . husband’s wealth, from his thriving Saudi Arabian business empire, as . anywhere between £100m and £1billion in 2001. Their dispute hinges on Mr . Sharbatly’s claims that both their Islamic marriage and divorce were . invalid under English law, which he says means English courts have no . business intervening in their affairs. But a family judge rejected this claim in March this year. Mrs Shagroon says her marriage ended . in March 2002 when her husband ‘pronounced talaq’, the equivalent of . divorce proceedings under Islamic law. But James Turner QC, for Mr . Sharbatly, said their wedding could not be recognised because he was . already married at the time under Islamic law and therefore the talaq . dissolving it was also void. In effect, there was ‘never a marriage’, he claimed. Mr Cusworth said Mrs Shagroon was not . trying to get a bigger slice of her ex-husband’s fortune but was trying . to ‘regularise’ her position.

While Hollywood has focused on huge amounts of explosives or spacecraft on a kamikaze mission to deflect asteroids, Us expert say the reality could be a little simpler - and stranger. Researchers believe a very pale asteroid would reflect sunlight, and say that over time, this bouncing of photons off its surface could create enough of a force to push the asteroid off its course. However, asteroids are made of dark rock - so the team proposed using a large space based paintball gun to coat it with white paint. Experts have developed several theories to deflect asteroids, the latest being using space launched paintballs to alter their course . If timed just right, researchers say pellets full of . paint powder, launched in two rounds from a spacecraft at relatively . close distance, would cover the front and back of an asteroid. This would, more than . doubling its reflectivity. Researchers found the combination of the initial force from the pellets would . bump an asteroid off course, and over over time, the sun’s photons would deflect . the asteroid even more. However, researchers estimate that it would take up to 20 . years for the cumulative effect of solar radiation pressure to . successfully pull the asteroid off its Earthbound trajectory. Sung Wook Paek, a graduate student in MIT’s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, says if timed just right, pellets full of paint powder, launched in two rounds from a spacecraft at relatively close distance, would cover the front and back of an asteroid, more than doubling its reflectivity, or albedo. The initial force from the pellets would bump an asteroid off course; over time, the sun’s photons would deflect the asteroid even more. Paek’s paper detailing this unconventional strategy won the 2012 Move an Asteroid Technical Paper Competition, sponsored by the United Nations’ Space Generation Advisory Council, which solicits creative solutions to space-related problems from students and young professionals. Paek presented his paper this month at the International Astronautical Congress in Naples, Italy. The challenge put forth by this year’s U.N. competition was to identify novel solutions for safely deflecting a near-Earth object, such as an asteroid. Scientists have proposed a wide variety of methods to avoid an asteroid collision. Some proposals launch a projectile or spacecraft to collide with an incoming asteroid; the European Space Agency is currently investigating such a mission. Other methods have included detonating a nuclear bomb near an asteroid or equipping spacecraft as 'gravity tractors,' using a craft’s gravitational field to pull an asteroid off its path. Paek’s paintball strategy builds on a solution submitted by last year’s competition winner, who proposed deflecting an asteroid with a cloud of solid pellets. Paek came up with a similar proposal, adding paint to the pellets to take advantage of solar radiation pressure — the force exerted on objects by the sun’s photons. The unique idea would use a space based version of a paintball gun to fire pellets at an asteroid . Researchers have observed that pressure from sunlight can alter the orbits of geosynchronous satellites, while others have proposed equipping spacecraft with sails to catch solar radiation, much like a sailboat catches wind. In his proposal, Paek used the asteroid Apophis as a theoretical test case. According to astronomical observations, this 27-gigaton rock may come close to Earth in 2029, and then again in 2036. Paek determined that five tons of paint would be required to cover the massive asteroid, which has a diameter of 1,480 feet. He used the asteroid’s period of rotation to determine the timing of pellets, launching a first round to cover the front of the asteroid, and firing a second round once the asteroid’s backside is exposed. As the pellets hit the asteroid’s surface, they would burst apart, splattering the space rock with a fine, five-micrometer-layer of paint. From his calculations, Paek estimates that it would take up to 20 years for the cumulative effect of solar radiation pressure to successfully pull the asteroid off its Earthbound trajectory. He says launching pellets with traditional rockets may not be an ideal option, as the violent takeoff may rupture the payload. Instead, he envisions paintballs may be made in space, in ports such as the International Space Station, where a spacecraft could then pick up a couple of rounds of pellets to deliver to the asteroid. Paek adds that paint isn’t the only substance that such pellets might hold. For instance, the capsules could be filled with aerosols that, when fired at an asteroid, 'impart air drag on the incoming asteroid to slow it down,' Paek says. 'Or you could just paint the asteroid so you can track it more easily with telescopes on Earth. 'So there are other uses for this method.' Computer generated simulation shows an asteroid striking the Earth - something the new research could avoid .","MIT researchers found that coating asteroid in paint could affect its reflectivity, altering its course .

A teenager who admitted burgling an astonishing 278 homes was told yesterday that his offending was ‘off the Richter scale’. Adam Crampton, 19, was already serving a four-year sentence for robbery and burglary when he decided to ‘clear the slate’ by confessing to all his crimes. He took police officers on four separate tours to point out properties he had raided. There were 200 in one area of Leicester alone. Serial criminal: Adam Crampton burgled 278 homes and stole 60 cars in Leicestershire and Rutland . At the city’s crown court, he was given an additional five years on top of his current sentence. Judge Simon Hammond said the number of burglaries Crampton had carried out was ‘off the Richter scale’ when it came to sentencing guidelines, adding: ‘What I am presented with here is a huge number of burglaries. For many people, their homes are never the same again. The effects never leave them. ‘You were a persistent and remorseless burglar. Life is about choices and responsibilities. This can only be dealt with by way of a substantial custodial sentence.’ James Varley, defending, said that Crampton, of no fixed address, had a difficult upbringing, was led astray when he was 12, and had trouble with cannabis and cocaine. The court heard that during his tours with police officers, Crampton described his ‘modus operandi’, and ‘demonstrated intimate knowledge of the buildings involved’. Ben Gow, prosecuting, said: ‘The police were able to compare this with the actual offence reported. ‘They had no other evidence other than his admissions. ‘There was no DNA left, or fingerprints, and so on.’ Confessed to crimes: Crampton revealed the full extent of his criminal history in interviews with police, even taking them on tours and pointing out homes he targeted . Crampton admitted three specimen counts of burglary and asked for hundreds of others to be considered as well as the theft of 60 vehicles, mostly mopeds, during the raids between 2005 and 2011. One of his victims, 60-year-old  Sylvia Hammond, told of her relief  at finally discovering the identity of her intruder. Crampton stole a laptop computer, a phone and a digital camera from Mrs Hammond’s home in Oakham, Rutland, in July 2007. She said: ‘It did cause great upset at the time. ‘If he is only 19 now he must have been very young then, only a child. ‘But it’s comforting to know who did it and also that the police have never given up even after all these years. You hear that a lot of people in prison go back to their old ways when they are released. ‘I just hope he doesn’t, now that he has admitted all of  these crimes.’ Detective Inspector Simon Cure, who led the investigation, said: ‘Today’s result is a great success for the victims, who now know who committed the crimes against them.’ Clean slate: Leicester Crown Court (pictured) heard that Crampton had ruined the lives of many people and must be heavily punished .","Adam Crampton pleaded guilty to three counts of burglary but asked for a further 278 break-ins and 60 car thefts be added .

The number of babies being adopted has fallen to a record low despite repeated promises to tackle delays and red tape. Just 76 children under the age of one were adopted last year – down from 95 in 2010 and 287 a decade ago. The trend suggests Coalition promises to speed up adoptions and sweep away apartheid-style race rules have yet to help. The overall number of adoptions rose slightly last year, fuelled by an increase in the number of one to four year olds finding permanent homes. Charities urged caution in interpreting the figures as the beginning of an upward trend. But the British Association for Adoption and Fostering said delays were a 'serious issue' and the system needed to better meet children’s needs. Child development experts have warned that major upheavals early in life are emotionally damaging yet many babies are passed between foster parents and carers before they find a permanent home. Barriers to adoption include an ideology prevalent among some social workers who believe it is bad for a child to be brought up by parents of another race. Many adoptions have also been prevented on the grounds that parents are too old or too unhealthy. Figures published yesterday by the Office for National Statistics show 4,777 children were adopted in 2011 – either from state care, from abroad or by step-parents – compared with 4,550 in 2010. Only 76 children under one were taken on by British families in 2011, down from 95 in 2010. But the number of under-ones adopted . fell to its lowest level since records began in 1974, when the figure . was 5,172. As recently as 1990, the figure was 969. The number of . children aged five to 17 being adopted also declined. Councils report . that older age groups are harder to place. At the same time, soaring numbers of children are being taken from their families and put in care following the Baby P scandal four years ago. Guidance to councils issued last year stripped away some of the myths blocking potentially suitable adoptions. And the Department for Education has started publishing 'scorecards' to reveal which councils are failing to ensure children in their care are adopted quickly. Meanwhile a new bill aims to speed up the adoption of babies and ban social workers from blocking adoptions on the grounds of race or ethnicity if an otherwise suitable family is available. Mission: David Cameron has said he is determined to speed up the adoption process, which currently takes more than two years . Under a new 'Fostering for Adoption' scheme, babies will be placed with foster families who want to adopt to reduce disruption to children in care. Fostering by approved adopters will become 'standard practice' for children under the age of one. Backing the scheme, Education Secretary Michael Gove, who was adopted at four months, said: 'My hope is that children don’t have to move again and again before finding a permanent home. 'The Government owes it to children to encourage more parents to consider adoption. In reforming the system we are determined to make sure the child’s interests are paramount.' John Simmonds of the BAAF said: 'We know delay is a serious issue and these figures remind everybody about the need to ensure that the system as a whole is as child centred as possible and clearly on the side of the child.' He welcomed the increase in adoptions among one to four year olds. A Department for Education spokesman said: 'We are committed to overhauling the entire adoption system to give more vulnerable children the chance of a loving, stable home with adoptive parents. That’s why we are changing the law and calling for urgent action.'","Only 76 children under one were taken on by British families in 2011, down from 95 in 2010 - 20% drop .

Symptoms such as irritability are often unfairly blamed on a woman's period, say Canadian researchers . Premenstrual syndrome in women has been over-estimated and may not be the cause of women’s bad moods at certain times of the month. That’s the controversial suggestion by Canadian researchers, who have suggested that symptoms such as irritability are often unfairly blamed on a woman’s period when other factors such as stress or a lack of support may be to blame. In a new study published in the journal Gender Medicine, researchers at the University of Toronto assessed a wealth of research relating to premenstrual syndrome (PMS). They concluded it ‘failed to provide clear evidence in support of the existence of a specific premenstrual negative mood syndrome’. The problem is we tend to dismissively blame everything on PMS, disregarding other reasons why women may be angry or upset. ‘The idea that any emotionality in women can be firstly attributed to their reproductive function  - we're sceptical about that,’  lead researcher Dr Sarah Romans told The Atlantic. ‘I think most would assume that PMS is much more firmly evidence-based than in fact it is.’ Dr Roman and her colleagues assessed more than 40 studies relating to PMS. While many found some association with mood at various times of a woman’s cycle, there was no clear pattern as to which part of the cycle was affected and sometimes no relationship at all. While there is a link between low mood at various times of a woman's cycle, there was no clear pattern as to which part of the cycle was affected . Thirty-sex per cent found no association between mood and the menstrual cycle. Another 42 per cent ‘found an association of negative mood in the premenstrual phase, combined with another phase of the menstrual cycle.’ Only 13 per cent found an association between negative mood and the premenstrual phase. This suggests that hormonal fluctuations related to the menstrual cycle aren't necessarily to blame. And ‘when there is a menstrual cycle tie-up it's actually perimenstrual -- the premenstrual (3-5 days before menstruation) and the menstrual phases together -- not purely premenstrual.’ added Dr Romans. She continued: ‘I think this can be seen as the modern day equivalent of the old wandering womb notion – that  women are hysterical because of their reproductive system. 'And when a woman's upset, it's still often one of the first thoughts people have - maybe she's premenstrual, rather than 'Is her physical health bad? Is she under a lot of stress? Is she lacking social support?'"" Negative moods have long been associated with the menstrual cycle, with references to the issue found in medical literature as far back as the 1930s.","Symptoms such as irritability are often unfairly blamed on a woman’s period, say Canadian researchers .

A millionaire golf course owner was stabbed to death during a drunken row with a handyman on his dream retirement estate in the Dordogne, a court heard today. Peter Fuller, 67, had moved to the unspoilt area of south west France following a distinguished but stressful career with the Total Oil company. But three years ago he became involved in an argument with Neil Ludlam, a 33-year-old friend from England who was helping out with DIY work on Mr Fuller’s five bedroom house. Today Perigueux Criminal Court was told that Ludlam had only been working on the estate for three weeks when the fight started. Ludlam,who faces 30 years in prison if convicted of murder, admitted a violent row following a heavy drinking session, but said he could not member much about it. Peter Fuller died after becoming involved in an argument with handyman Neil Ludlam. He was found at his five bedroom home in the Dordogne area of France by his ex-wife . However, an autopsy report showed that Fuller died from a stab wound to the chest, with a knife puncturing his right lung. Some details of the attack, which took place on June 26, 2009, were recalled by Ludlam, who said: ‘We argued in the kitchen. Fuller fell down and hurt his head. He said he had a gun and wouldn't hesitate to use it.’ Mr Fuller, who was originally from Chatham in Kent, had been in the tiny village of Plaisance – which means Pleasure - near Bergerac, for more than six years. He created the Mirandes Golf and Country Club nearby, designing its 18-hole course himself. It was meant to remind the many British expats in the area of home, serving fish and chips, and bangers and mash in its restaurant. Ludlam was living alone in a caravan in the grounds of Mr Fuller’s house, and carried out maintenance including gardening. Mr Fuller's ex-wife, Wilhemina Jans, said she had found him lying face down in a pool of blood on June 27, 2009 – the day after his death. Ludlam was living alone in a caravan in the grounds of Mr Fuller's house, and carried out maintenance including gardening . She saw signs of a violent struggle everywhere, including blood on the kitchen walls and floors. Broken glasses and furniture also lay everywhere. Two of Mr Fuller's cars had been stolen, although one was later found crashed nearby. A police investigation found blood on two knives owned by Ludlam, and there were also traces in his caravan and on his clothes. Ludlam was described as ‘acting suspiciously’ by locals in the days after the murder, and he returned to Britain. But British police arrested him as he stepped off a flight at Luton airport from Bordeaux, and he was extradited to France a month later. Ludlam said the fight had started when the pair started exchanging childish family insults about each other. His defence barrister, Philippe de Caunes, said: ‘While he doesn't remember everything, he regrets his act and is still at a loss as to how he could have done such a thing given that he considered the victim his friend.’ Some 20,000 British expats live in the Dordogne. It is hugely popular because its countryside resembles the best of the UK's, but it enjoys a warm, summer climate for most of the year. Low property prices also make it very attractive to retired people. The case continues.

The manuscript, found in an attic, bore the name 'Del Signore Giovane Wolfgango Mozart', Italian for 'Mr Wolfgang Mozart Jr'. Mozart's father, Leopold (left), often used 'Wolfgango' when labelling works written by his young son (at piano) From the style of the composition, Hermann-Schneider attributed it to Mozart at around the age of 11. The . piece exhibits 'a series of components that are found repeatedly in . other Mozart piano works,' said the foundation in a statement. It added: 'Judging . by the current level of knowledge, it thus has to be a genuine sonata . phrase from Mozart.' Hermann-Schneider encountered the music when gathering handwritten pieces for the Répertoire International des Sources Musicales, an international organisation which catalogues music sources preserved around the world. The piece was handed over to a professional music copyist in Tyrol who identified the writing and confirmed it was produced by the composer while still a youngster. Although Mozart died more than 200 years . ago, he was such a prolific writer that unknown works are still . occasionally being discovered. The sonata is the third previously unknown work by Mozart to be found in six years. The other discoveries were in 2006 and 2010 of the so-called Nannerl-music books. Leopold is thought to have written music in the books for his daughter Maria Ann, known as Nannerl, and later put in some compositions of his young son.

A barmaid who was asked by her manager to show off her breasts in a push-up bra to boost a pub's trade has won £10,000 in compensation. Kathryn Broughton, 21, was given the nickname 'little t*ts' by her boss Andrew Stephens and asked if she was wearing a push-up bra. When the shy university graduate failed to reply, the 33-year-old married man told her: 'Well you really should.' 'Intimating': Blonde barmaid Kathryn Broughton (left) has won £10,000 in damages after telling an employment tribunal how she endured six months of sexual harassment from her pub manager Andrew Stephens (right) Miss Broughton told an employment tribunal: 'He then said we will get more customers and you will get more tips.' The part-time barmaid won her claim for sex discrimination after she quit the real ale pub in disgust following a string of rude remarks. She claimed on-going sexual harassment over a six-month period by Mr Stephens, who is a shareholder in the pub company which runs the Rutland Arms in Sheffield city centre. Miss Broughton said her boss first called her 'little t*ts' to 'curry favour' with a member of staff with whom he was engaging in banter at the bar and repeated it on several occasions in front of other bar and kitchen staff. When she was off work sick, Mr Stephens made a comment about her having a sexually transmitted disease and he labelled her boyfriend a transvestite. 'Far removed from reality': Miss Broughton quit working at the Rutland Arms (above) in Sheffield city centre in disgust after a string of rude remarks, which included being given the nickname 'little t*ts' In a Facebook message, Miss Broughton was told of a rumour that female bar staff could be asked to wear more revealing tops. It culminated in her resigning following the incident on June 1, 2010 after Mr Stephens drank at least five pints one evening and was chatting to customers and then kitchen staff at the bar. He directed the 'push-up bra' comment towards her at the end of the evening and Miss Broughton said: 'I felt upset and degraded and very self-conscious.' She became aware of her breasts being stared at, she said. 'I was a bit scared. I didn’t want to talk about it to anyone,' she added. Miss Broughton was so frightened she called her boyfriend to take her home and she immediately quit and fired off a letter of complaint saying she found the remarks inappropriate. She wrote: 'I found them intimidating and insulting. They were unwarranted and amounted to harassment.' Her barrister Simon Pallo told the Sheffield hearing: 'She was a young lady in a relatively male-dominated workplace and she’s quite a retiring, shy girl.' Mr Stephens denied making any sexual comments to the barmaid. Judge John Trayler . He said she had never raised any grievance with him and he did not make any comments about sexually transmitted infections or call her boyfriend a transvestite. He said the picture she painted of the Rutland Arms was 'far removed from reality' although they did have nicknames for staff. One was called 'Fat Paul' although he was slim, there was 'Staring Richard' who stared at people and he himself was called 'Steve the man', but he denied calling Miss Broughton 'little t*ts'. The tribunal heard a female friend of Miss Broughton’s posted on her Facebook wall a message reading 'tits, tits, I love tits.' Mr Stephens said: 'Perhaps she is not as adverse in talking to her friends in that way.' But Miss Broughton said she took it as a joke between friends and it was different if an employer had made such a comment. The panel decided Miss Broughton’s sex discrimination claim in her favour after a two-day hearing. Employment Judge John Trayler said in his judgment that the panel believed the comments were made as described by the barmaid although the sexually-transmitted disease remark was not an act of discrimination but 'unwelcome' nevertheless. Mr Trayler said there was evidence that the physical characteristics of employees at the pub were identified and this was a factor that had to be taken into account. He said: 'There is a possibility the claimant may have been referred to by Mr Stephens as ""little t*ts"" either as part of banter which had gone too far or a nickname which had been initiated but not stuck.' 'There was nothing which might have been misconceived or misinterpreted by Miss Broughton. We think it more likely than not that the claimant’s version is correct.' He added: 'She’s a relatively quiet-spoken individual whom we believe was pretty upset. The circumstances were serious and caused her to give up her job.' Miss Broughton was awarded £10,000 for injury to feelings and £529.34 in wages plus interest against Mr Stephens and the Sheffield-based pub company Reet Ale Pubs.","Shy graduate Kathryn Broughton told she should wear push-up bra .

Women who play away from home might want to consider the punishment meted out for similar indiscretions hundreds of years ago in Warwickshire. While adultery in this day and age might end up in the divorce courts, women guilty of such a crime during the late Middle Ages were forced to endure a very unusual form of retribution - reciting a humiliating ditty while sitting backwards on a ram, holding its tail. This is just one of many punishments that were routinely handed out in Warwickshire for activities banned in the county for more than six centuries. And many of the offences themselves would now be considered equally ridiculous.

A mother was caught on camera multiple times choking her 15-month old son while he was in the hospital receiving treatment, police said. Dashana Oldham, 20, allegedly choked him at least eight times within an hour and 20-minute period at a children’s hospital in Indianapolis. Doctors at the hospital had hooked him on a video EEG to monitor the boy’s symptoms. Caught: Dashana Oldham was caught on video choking her son while he was in the hospital being monitored for breathing problems . Place: She had taken her son to the Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis for tests; doctors filmed her choking her son during the tests . According to the Indy Star, Oldham had been taking her son to Riley Children’s Hospital for a few months because the boy’s extremities would turn blue and he would lose consciousness. When the doctors noted significant dips in the boy’s oxygen levels, they looked to his EKG video, which revealed Oldham choking him. She then tells her son: ‘Just go night, night,’ according to the court documents. The syndrome, named after an 18th century German officer known to embellish his stories – is a made-up disorder or mental illness where a patient acts as if they have a symptom or mental issue. The truth is, though, the patient causes the disorder themselves. Some examples of the syndrome are people faking cancer, infections, and skin disorders. The documents also state that Oldham continued to choke her son even after he had vomited, but asks him, ‘Are you okay?’ At that point, the oxygen alarm went off, and the video shows Oldham calmly pressing the nurse call button, according to the Indy Star. However, as the probable cause affidavit notes, her son’s symptoms were due to proxy symptoms of Munchausen syndrome – that is, when a person acts as though they have a physical disorder when they in fact have caused the symptoms. The 20-year-old mother also said that she was only trying to administer CPR to her son in the video. Later, she told police that she was not trying to kill her son, but if she had that goal in mind, would have used more pressure. Oldham has been charged with six counts of aggravated battery, as well as six counts of neglect of a dependent. She is being held on $40,000 bond.","Dashana Oldham caught in video at hospital choking young son .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 00:57 EST, 24 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 00:57 EST, 24 October 2012 . A woman was found guilty Tuesday of disorderly conduct for berating security officers trying to pat down her teenage daughter and then refusing to submit to the procedure herself at a Tennessee airport. Jurors deliberated four hours before convicting Andrea Abbott. She had faced up to 30 days in jail and a $50 fine for her conduct in the July 2011 confrontation at Nashville International Airport, but the judge placed her on probation for a year because she has no criminal record. Judge Joe P. Binkley Jr., warned the 42-year-old 'to be certain you don't get into any further problems with the law.' Charged: Andrea Fornella Abbott has been found guilty with a year probation after refusing to let her child have a TSA pat-down . Abbott didn't talk to reporters outside the courtroom. Her defense attorney, Brent Horst, said she was disappointed in the verdict, but felt she got a fair trial. 'She just wanted to stand on principle, because she felt that she had done nothing wrong,' said Horst, who handled the case pro bono. 'And I admire her for that.' The prosecution said Abbott's behavior 'prevented others from carrying out their lawful activities,' which is part of the definition of disorderly conduct under state law. Abbott testified during the first day of the trial on Monday that she was not unruly but did yell at officers. She said she was 'irritated, but not arguing.' However, Assistant District Attorney Megan King said in closing arguments Tuesday that Abbott's behavior caused two security lanes to be halted and made a normally one-minute security check a 30-minute ordeal. 'The defendant should have been aware that her behavior would prevent others from carrying out their lawful activities,' King said. Horst said his client may have been loud, but she was only exercising her right to free speech. 'Telling a police officer your opinion, even in strong language, to me that's a First Amendment right,' Horst told reporters. According to an affidavit, Abbott first refused to allow her daughter - then 14 - to go through a body scan machine, saying she didn't want 'someone to see our bodies naked.' Abbott and her daughter went through a . metal detector and TSA Officer Karen King was sent to conduct a . pat-down. King testified that before the pat-down, Abbott yelled in her . face that she didn't want anyone 'touching her daughter's crotch.' Abbott . was accompanying her daughter to the gate but not flying herself. She . eventually allowed her daughter to undergo the pat-down, but then . refused one for herself. By that point, airport police officer Jeff . Nolen had been called and he testified that he asked her several times . to calm down, but she wouldn't. Guilty: Abbott allegedly screamed at Nashville International Airport security that she didn't want anyone touching her daughter's private parts while going through a security check like this one (FILE PHOTO) 'You're not putting your (expletive) hands on me, this is (expletive),' he recalled Abbott saying. Nolen said he then arrested Abbott, who he said continued to curse and call officers pedophiles. Abbott had lived in Clarksville when she was charged and has since moved to Texas. 'She gave him no option,' district attorney King said Tuesday. 'She put him in that position with her behavior.' During her testimony, Abbott acknowledged that she did say a few curse words, but said she wasn't in anyone's face and had a 'normal conversation' about what she believed to be inappropriate about the pat-downs. Earlier Tuesday, Horst used a surveillance video of what happened to support his claim that Abbott was the one being yelled at and that she didn't create a distraction. The video, which didn't have audio, did show Nolen speaking to Abbott close up and making some hand motions. It also showed people walking around Abbott and the officers. 'It's clear from the video ... she wasn't preventing anything,' Horst said. However, district attorney King said the video 'doesn't tell the complete story of this case,' which she said 'is not a free speech issue.' She said the officers reminded Abbott several times that she could file a complaint if she had a problem with the security check proceedings. 'You can speak your mind, but you can't do it in an illegal manner,' she said. 'What the defendant did was a crime.' The case briefly drew national attention as hundreds offered Abbott support and donations amid debate over whether new, intrusive screening methods should be allowed at airports. 'Since 9/11, we're losing a lot of freedom, and we have to draw the line somewhere,' Horst said in closing arguments.","Andrea Fornella Abbott, 41, was arrested at Nashville International Airport in July .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 02:55 EST, 19 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:55 EST, 19 June 2012 . Destructive: Researchers have found the two cyber weapons are connected . U.S.companies frustrated by their inability to stop sophisticated . hacking attacks are taking retaliatory action, sometimes outside the . law, experts say. Known in the cybersecurity industry as 'active defense' or 'strike-back' technology, the reprisals range from modest steps to distract and delay . a hacker to more controversial measures. Security experts say they even know of some cases where companies have . taken action that could violate laws in the U.S. or other countries, . such as hiring contractors to hack the assailant's own systems. In the past, companies that have been attacked have mostly focused on . repairing the damage to their computer networks and shoring them up to . prevent future breaches. But with malicious software widely available on the Internet for anyone . wanting to cause trouble, prevention is increasingly difficult and . companies are growing more aggressive. 'Not only do we put out the fire, but we also look for the arsonist,' said Shawn Henry, a former head of cybercrime investigations at the FBI. In April he joined new cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, which aims to . provide clients with a menu of active responses. Once a company detects a network breach, rather than expel the intruder . immediately, it can waste the hacker's time and resources by appearing . to grant access to tempting material that proves impossible to extract. Companies can also allow intruders to make off with bogus files or . 'beacons' that reveal information about the thieves' own machines, . experts say. Mr Henry and CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovich do not recommend . that companies try to breach their opponent's computers, but they say . the private sector does need to fight back more boldly against cyber . espionage. It is commonplace for law firms to have their emails hacked and read . during negotiations for ventures in China, Mr Alperovich told the . Reuters Global Media and Technology Summit. That has given the other side tremendous leverage because they know the . Western client company's strategy, including the most they would be . willing to pay for a certain stake. But if a company knows its lawyers will be hacked, it can plant false . information and get the upper hand. 'Deception plays an enormous role,' Mr Alperovich said. Flame: The sophisticated virus has been used to spy on computer systems . Other security experts say a more aggressive posture is unlikely to have . a significant impact in the near term in the overall fight against . cybercriminals and Internet espionage. Veteran government and private officials warn that much of the activity . is too risky to make sense, citing the chances for escalation and . collateral damage. 'There is no business case for it and no possible positive outcome,' said John Pescatore, a National Security Agency and Secret Service . veteran who leads research firm Gartner's Internet security practice. Nevertheless, the movement shows the deep anger and sense of futility . among security professionals, many of whom feel that a bad situation is . getting worse, endangering both their companies and the national . economy. 'There's nothing you can do' to keep determined and well-financed . hackers out, said Rodney Joffe, senior technologist at Internet . infrastructure company Neustar Inc and an advisor to the White House on . cybersecurity. Mr Joffe recently looked at 168 of the largest 500 U.S. companies by . revenue and found evidence in Neustar forensic logs that 162 of them . owned machines that at some point had been transmitting data out to . hackers. Frustration by security professionals is not new. Some privately . admitted to rooting for Lulz Security last year during that hacking . group's unprecedented spree of public crimes, when it broke into and . embarrassed Sony Corp, an FBI affiliate and others with routine hacking . techniques. They said the resulting media coverage finally caught the attention of . CEOs and legislators, although tougher cybersecurity laws have yet to . pass Congress. Collaboration: Experts say they have found evidence that the two programmes shared the same source code . Although some strike-backs have occurred quietly in the past, Facebook . popularised going on offensive, said Jeff Moss, founder of the . influential Black Hat security conferences and an advisor to the . Department of Homeland Security. In January, Facebook Inc named some of the Russian players behind the . malicious 'Koobface' software that spread through spam on various social . networks, earning the gang an estimated $2million. The security industry's shortcomings were underscored most recently by . the discovery of the Flame spying virus in the Middle East. Mikko Hypponen, the well-regarded chief research officer at Finland's . F-Secure Oyj, told the Reuters Summit his company had a sample of Flame . in 2010 and classified it as clean and later missed another virus called . Duqu that was suspected of being backed by Western governments. 'These are examples how we are failing' as an industry, Mr Hypponen said. 'Consumer-grade antivirus you buy from the store does not work too well . trying to detect stuff created by the nation-states with nation-state . budgets.' Because some national governments are suspected in attacks on private . Western companies, it is natural that some of the victims want to join . their own governments to fight back. 'It's time to have the debate about what the actions would be for the . private sector,' former NSA director Kenneth Minihan said at the RSA . security conference held earlier this year in San Francisco. In April, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano . told the San Jose Mercury News that officials had been contemplating . authorising even 'proactive' private-entity attacks, although there has . been little follow-up comment. Many large security providers no longer preach that keeping the enemy . out is paramount. Instead, they adopt the more recent line taken by the . Pentagon, which is to assume that hackers have gotten inside and will . again. The mainstream advice now is to focus on trying to detect suspicious activity as quickly as possible in order to shut it down. Hitting back with force is only the most colorful of possible responses . after that. More common alternatives include deep analysis of what data . has been sent out and attempts to learn whether the recipients were . competitors, criminals who might try to resell it, or national . governments, who might be inclined to share it with local industry. Some experts also say executives should identify their most prized . intellectual property and keep it off of networked computers and . consider evasive action - such as having 100 versions of a critical . digitised blueprint and only one that is genuine, with the right one . never identified in emails. 'There is a reason that people fly halfway around the world to have a one-hour meeting,' Mr Joffe said of intelligence agencies.","Range of companies now offering retaliatory services to companies facing hacking attacks .

Lance Armstrong speaks at the beginning of the annual Team Livestrong Challenge in Austin, Texas on Sunday . Members of the cycling community have described the difficulty they faced in standing up to Armstrong and tell the truth in the doping scandal. So powerful a figure was Armstrong within his sport that for years they felt too paranoid to come forward, frightened that their reputations would be damaged. Since then many victims have broken their silence, including Betsy Andreu, the wife of a former Armstrong teammate. She described receiving a voicemail from an Armstrong friend telling her she hoped 'somebody breaks a baseball bat over your head,' after her husband spoke out about doping allegations. At the time, victims told the New York Daily News, the feared voicing allegations against Armstrong would lead to being accused of being jealous, unpatriotic or even drunk. Some 4,000 cyclists will ride 18, 65 or 100 miles in a show of support for cancer survivors . Livestrong President and CEO Doug Ulman speaks at the begining of the annual Team Livestrong Challenge in Austin . But now they are following the lead of Frankie and Betsy Andreu and Greg and Kathy LeMond, who were among the first to speak out. 'I wanted to show what kind of treatment we were getting,' Mrs Andreu told the Daily News after the series of abusive voicemails were published in 2010. 'When I got those phone calls, I was worried on one hand and disgusted on the other.' In a separate incidents Mrs LeMond told how Armstrong offered to pay $300,000 to a former teammates to claim that he had seen LeMond using an oxygen-boosting drug. 'It shows how desperate Lance was,' she said. 'It is a huge example of what a bully Lance Armstrong is. He crosses lines no others will cross.' Betsy and Frankie Andreu are among those to have spoken out against Lance Armstrong . Greg LeMond and his wife Kathy are among those to have spoken out against Lance Armstrong . Armstrong has been . turned into an outcast in professional cycling and most of his personal . sponsors dropped him this week after the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency . released a massive report detailing performance-enhancing drug use by . the seven-time Tour de France winner. USADA has ordered him banned from . cycling for life and stripped of his Tour de France victories. The man who led the anti-doping investigation, USADA CEO Travis Tygart, has often spoken of the same motivation and he has paid a price to come this far. He previously said he was the target of death threats; he has been a constant target of Armstrong and his attorneys, who have called his mission a ""witch hunt"" and worse. He persevered, explaining: 'I've heard the stories from the athletes. I've heard them from the clean athletes who left their sport and felt personally robbed.' Tygart insisted he treated Armstrong the same as any other cyclist in his investigation but Armstrong sees things differently. 'This isn't about Tygart wanting to clean up cycling,' he wrote in a letter to The Associated Press. 'Rather it's just a plain ol' selective prosecution that reeks of vendetta.' Speaking on Friday in his opening remarks at Livestrong's 15th . anniversary celebration, Armstrong said . he had been through a 'difficult couple of weeks' and urged supporters . of his cancer-fighting charity to stand behind its mission. 'The . mission is bigger than me. It's bigger than any individual,' he said. Dark Days: Lance Armstrong, seen here during a conference last August in Montreal, celebrated Livestrong's 15th anniversary Friday night as new allegations surfaced about offering $50,000 bribes to fellow cyclists. Survivors: Armstrong is joined him are members of Livestrong's staff, many of whom are cancer survivors. Armstrong said he has been through a ""difficult couple of weeks."" Meanwhile, reports surfaced that Armstrong offered bribes to a cycling opponent to throw a race back in 1993. The Australian Broadcasting Corp. uncovered court documents indicating that Lance Armstrong offered to bribe other cyclists at a group of races back in 1993, including one in Philly. New Zealand cyclist Steven Swart gave a sworn deposition during a 2006 lawsuit involving Armstrong where he alleged that Armstrong offered an opponent $50,000 to help fix the CoreStates U.S. Pro Cycling race in Philadelphia as well as events in Pittsburgh and West Virginia. Armstrong, . who denies doping, didn't address the USADA report or the doping . charges in his remarks Friday night. Instead, he focused on the mission of the . foundation he started in 1997. Armstrong was diagnosed in 1996 with . testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain. 'I . am ... truly humbled by your support,' Armstrong said after receiving a . standing ovation from the crowd of 1,700. 'It's been an interesting . couple of weeks. It's been a difficult couple of weeks for me and my . family, my friends and this foundation.' Armstrong said he's been asked many times how he is doing. 'I . say, `I've been better, but I've also been worse,'' said Armstrong, . making his first public appearance since the USADA report was released . last week. Guests Arrive: Robin Williams and Norah Jones were among the guests who attended the 15th anniversary celebration gala of Livestrong, Lance Armstrong's cancer-fighting charity. On Monday, the International Cycling Union is expected to announce whether it will appeal USADA's sanctions. The . celebration gala came two days after Armstrong stepped down as chairman . of Livestrong to help shield the charity from the fallout of the . controversy swirling around him. He remains on the board of directors. Armstrong urged the crowd to continue fighting to help cancer patients and survivors. Celebrity Cause: Actor Sean Penn arrives on the yellow carpet for the ""An Evening with Livestrong"" gala fundraising event in Austin, Texas. 'There's 28 million people around the world living with this disease,' Armstrong said. 'Thank you for your support.' Livestrong . officials expected to raise $2.5 million from the event, which included . appearances by actors Sean Penn and Robin Williams and singer Norah . Jones. Armstrong won the Tour de France every . year from 1999-2005 and his success on the bike helped propel the . foundation into one of the most popular and well-known charities in the . country. Livestrong has raised about $500 million in the fight against . cancer. In 2004, the foundation introduced the . yellow 'Livestrong' bracelets, selling more than 80 million and . creating a global symbol for cancer awareness and survival. The . silent auction included two Trek bicycles valued up to $12,000 - Trek . was one of the companies that dropped Armstrong as a sponsor on . Wednesday - and seven autographed yellow jerseys Armstrong wore on the . podium during his Tour de France victories. Gerry . Goldstein, a criminal defense attorney and friend of Armstrong for . several years, criticized USADA's investigation and sanctions of . Armstrong. Drug testers never caught Armstrong when he was competing, Goldstein said. 'I'm . a big fan of what he has done. Overcoming cancer and doing what he did, . who gives a (expletive) about anything else? That's so much more . important as a role model and a human being,' Goldstein said. 'Quit . whining about it.' Kansas City Royals pitcher . Jeremy Guthrie, who donated a pair of cleats to the silent auction, said . he wants to continue supporting Livestrong. Stepping Down: Armstrong resigned as head of the Livestrong Foundation this week. as a new report shows that he and his team used performance drugs.

One of Britain’s oldest umpires has been forced to retire despite his perfect eyesight and good health because he is no longer covered by insurance. Charlie Fenton, 92, was disappointed that he had to step down from the Derbyshire and Cheshire Cricket League after more than 61 years umpiring matches. The spritely pensioner is no longer covered under the league’s insurance which only insures umpires up to the age of 85-years-old. All out: One of Britain's oldest umpires Charlie Fenton, 92, has been forced to retire from umpiring after more than 61 years in the position . Mr Fenton, from Hyde, Tameside, said: ‘I’m so lucky. I’m so fit, I don’t wear glasses, I don’t wear a hearing aid and I can stand for seven hours. ‘I’m so happy I’ve had a great career but, of course, I’m disappointed it’s come to an end. ‘I won’t get bored in the summer, though, as I’ve promised to help the boys coming through next season and pass on some of my knowledge.’ Not covered: Mr Fenton is no longer covered under the league's insurance which only insures umpires up to the age of 85-years-old . The great-grandfather’s love of the game began at school when he travelled to Old Trafford to watch Lancashire play. He said: ‘My mum would pack me off on the train with a bottle of pop and send me to watch Lancashire. ‘Cricket is a sport which just grows on you.’ His passion for watching cricket was put on hold during World War Two, but by the early 1950s he was spending his weekends umpiring, combining it with his job as a partner in a firm of Manchester estate agents. He shared his love of cricket with late wife Jessie and their two daughters. Mr Fenton said: ‘I’ve never missed a single match. On the pitch: Mr Fenton has enjoyed his umpiring career on the pitch but is disappointed it has come to an end . ‘If I was ill, it was between Monday to Friday, I was always better by the weekends. ‘I can honestly say I’ve never had a cigarette; I’ve always got out and about, so I think that might be why my health has stayed the way it is.’ Next month he will be presented with an award from the league in honour of his long service. The league’s honorary secretary, Mike Brown, said: ‘We hadn’t realised the age limit on our insurance policy is 85. ‘We said could he carry on if he found his own insurance but that was a non-starter. 'Grows on you': The great-grandfather has loved cricket since he was at school when he travelled to Old Trafford to watch Lancashire play . ‘It’s with great sadness that we’ve had to say goodbye to Charlie. ‘We have our annual dinner on November 9 where we’ll present him with something suitable to mark his many years of service.’ The oldest umpire was Joe Filliston who was still umpiring at 100-years-old. He played for Staffordshire. Mr Fenton could be the longest-serving umpire.

Back behind bars: Ricky Wheeldon, 53, had been on the run for five months in Jackson, Michigan when he was caught by state troopers . Hounded: Duane 'Dog' Chapman (pictured center with his team) has been in Michigan chasing down a convicted drug felon but was pipped at the post by state troopers . A handgun and drugs were found in the vehicle, police said. It will come as a stinging blow to the Dog, otherwise known as Duane Chapman, who is the 'world's greatest bounty hunter', according to the network which films his TV series. He has made more that 6,000 captures in his 27-year career. Dog had been in Jackson . since the beginning of October, helping Leo's Bail Bonds track down . Wheeldon in order to recoup their $500,000.

Mr Urban later told mlive.com that Dog and his wife Beth, also a bounty hunter, had arrived in town at the start of October at his request. He praised their assistance in being able to get people talking about the whereabouts of the suspect. Mr and Mrs Chapam were filming for their next TV series, for which they are reportedly paid $200,000 per episode.

The convicted felon was back in court . on Wednesday where Judge Thomas Wilson gave him a sentencing date of . November 29.

Michigan State Police had tracked Wheeldon to a home in Leslie, a small town in Ingham County. Officers were preparing to search the house, when a truck pulled away from the property at around 12.45am.

Disgraced peer Conrad Black branded a television presenter a 'jackass' yesterday in a terse clash over the former media mogul’s criminal past. The unrepentant convict criticised Sky’s Adam Boulton for his 'predictable questions' and accused the political editor of not knowing 'what he was talking about'. It came after a fractious interview on BBC2’s Newsnight on Monday night, which saw Black tell Jeremy Paxman he was proud he had endured their tense exchange without 'getting up and smashing your face in'. Belligerent: Conrad Black answers the 'predictable' questions by Sky's Adam Boulton - who inadvertently uses his middle finger as a gesture while he questions him . Not amused: Black is defiant about his convictions, and has attacked interviewers who have questioned him about his criminal past . His belligerent displays promise a fiery appearance on Friday night's Have I Got News For You quiz show, which will see him tackling panellists Ian Hislop and Paul Merton, renowned for their scathing views on well-known figures. Black, former proprietor of the Daily Telegraph, has arrived in the UK to promote his new book A Matter Of Principle,but is clearly in no mood to to answer any uncomfortable questions. He has taken the approach of denying that he was ever in the wrong and shouting at anyone who suggests he is a criminal. Defiant Black, who was imprisoned for three years for defrauding investors, insisted he had nothing to be ashamed of and indicated his potential plans to retake his seat in the House of Lords. Asked by Mr Boulton where he would live now he had been 'kicked out' of the United States, Black said: 'Stop being a jackass. You are just being abrasive. No, you don’t know what you are talking about.' Black said he was only tolerating the interview to publicise his unflinching memoir that describes his nine-year battle with the US justice system. Conrad Black said he was proud of not 'smashing in' Jeremy Paxman's face on the Newsnight interview after the presenter asked some probing questions . Black said he felt like vomiting after enduring Paxman's unflinching questions about his convictions and his personal life . He added: 'I’m selling books. That’s why I am here. I’m not here to enjoy your somewhat predictable questions.' It is his memoir that has brought him to the UK and the studios of Have I Got News For You, Newsnight and Sky News, a decision that has sparked amusement and amazement in equal measure. If there is one thing the panellists on the Have I got News For You show like more than taking potshots at a pillar of the establishment, then it is demolishing a fallen pillar of the establishment – yet Lord Black, 68, couldn’t care less. Mr Boulton suggested Black would end up . as a 'figure of fun' when he appears on the BBC’s Have I Got News For . You later this week, but was told: 'We’ll see who makes whom a figure of . fun. I normally don’t mind exchanging acerbities if that’s what people . want to do.' Black, whose empire once included the . Chicago Sun-Times, The Jerusalem Post and . small papers across the U.S. and Canada, returned to prison last . September to finish serving his sentence, and was released in May. On Monday night Black, who was released from a US jail earlier this year, accused Paxman of being a 'priggish, gullible, British fool' for taking seriously the 'ghastly' American justice system. 'Let me tell you something, I am proud of having gone through the terribly difficult process of being falsely charged, falsely convicted and ultimately almost completely vindicated without losing my mind, becoming irrational, ceasing to be a penitent and reasonable person and actually being able to endure a discussion like this without getting up and smashing your face in, which is what most people would do if they had been through what I had been.' Conrad Black and his wife Barbara Amiel, pictured at a court last year, have stayed strong despite the former media mogul's time in prison . Coming out fighting: Conrad Black insists he is not a criminal and made no 'ethical mistakes' Paxman said: 'Well, you go ahead.' 'No, I don’t believe in violence,' Black replied. Asked if he expected to retain his seat in the House of Lords he said: 'Well, why not? First of all there is not a prohibition on a convicted criminal sitting in that House.' He told Paxman he had been 'persecuted half to death', before announcing: 'I don't have any shame' when questioned about his conviction, reiterating: 'I am not a criminal.' He insisted he was innocent, saying the accusations are 'rubbish, and anyone can see they are rubbish. I'm not a convicted fraudster.' However, he did concede to a bemused-looking Paxman that he had been too easy-going before his disgrace. He said: 'I will agree that I probably became a bit insouciant and, to that extent, my downfall was justified.' But he also insisted he was not a criminal and had a morally clean record: ' I have made a lot of mistake, but not ethical ones.' As his tense interview with Jeremy Paxman continued, he also complained that he was 'going to throw up' when Paxman quizzed him about Black's wife, journalist Barbara Amiel, and asked if she was extravagant with money. He said: 'After seven years away, my first morning back in Britain and I have to be subjected to this? She's a magnificent wife.' Black, who owned a number of other world newspapers, was raised to the peerage as Baron Black of Crossharbour in 2001. Black showed that he was in no mood to tolerate any uncomfortable questions Paxman threw at him in the Newsnight interview. His most belligerent lines included him telling Paxman that he was a priggish, gullible, British fool.' He also told him that Paxman's grasp of the American judicial system was lacking: 'Your problem is that you have no idea how that system operates.' He demanded that Paxman stop being so 'bourgeois' with his questions, and told him that he was 'not a criminal.' He branded the bemused interviewer a 'priggish, gullible fool' for daring to suggest that convicted Black was a criminal. Clearly feeling fired up after his appearance on Newsnight, an exasperated-looking Black was interviewed by Adam Boulton on Sky News. The disgraced former media tycoon said he was only tolerating Boulton's 'somewhat predictable questions' because he is promoting his memoir. In another stinging swipe, Black carelessly asked Boulton his name again, as he had forgotten it earlier. He also told the political editor that he had 'no idea what he was talking about'. As a leaving remark, he assured Boulton, who questioned him about his appearance on HIGNFU, that he could defend himself against the notoriously acerbic wit of the pannelists. It started in 2003 when shareholders accused Black of skimming off millions of dollars from his global newspaper empire between 1999 and 2001. He was charged, alongside his associates at Hollinger holding company, and eventually convicted of stealing $6.1 million. They were accused of amassing the cash by handing themselves tax-free bonuses, from the selling off of their newspapers, without the consent of the firm's board. Black was sentenced, in 2007, to six and a half years (78 months) in prison. But, after he had served 29 months, the US Supreme Court dissolved the 'honest services' law that had formed the basis of his conviction. He was released in 2010 so that his case could be re-examined, and he succeeded in overturning two of his four initial convictions. It meant that he was responsible for de-frauding significantly less money than for what he was first convicted. The majority of his sentence pertained to an obstruction of justice - where he is said to have removed 13 boxes from his Toronto office while under investigation. Last June he was re-sentenced and was sent back to prison with 13 months left to serve. He was released five months in May early for good behaviour.","Former media mogul insists he is not a criminal and has not made any 'ethical mistakes'

Found: Tony Wawrzynski of Reno, Nevada has found his son that was kidnapped by the boy's mother 15 years ago -- and the boy is believed to be a victim in a Georgia child abuse scandal . A Nevada man's 15-year search for his missing son has ended after the boy, now 18, was found wandering around Los Angeles following years of alleged abuse by his biological mother and stepfather. Tony Wawrzynski of Reno, Nevada says he hasn't seen his son, Mitch, since the boy's mother kidnapped him when he was just three years old. Wawrzynski has written dozens of letters and hired a private investigator to try and find the boy, but his mother had changed her name and moved across the country. As the years passed, Wawrzynski had all but given up hope that he would ever find his son. Then last week, a detective found one of Wawrzynski's letters in the Georgia home of Sheila Comer, who is being investigated for allegedly locking her child in a room and starving him for years. That child's name is Mitch, and investigators believe that he is the son who Wawrzynski lost so many years ago. Authorities called Wawrzynski last week and informed him of their discovery and the Nevada father was overjoyed, but also heartbroken over what investigators believe his son has endured. 'It’s been really hard on me, I mean, me and Mitch when he was a baby, we were really close,' Wawrzynski told the Atlanta Journal Constitution. 'We were inseparable. When Mitch was a baby, I was the one that fed him. I was the one that changed his diapers.' Investigators say 18-year-old Mitch Comer was locked in a room in his home for years and was so malnourished that he still had his baby teeth and looked like a pre-teen . Shackled: Paul and Sheila Comer are led into Georgia courtroom for a hearing. They have been charged with child abuse . The pair were shackled in chains and in stripey jumpsuits when they arrived at court today . 'I thought he was a 12-year-old boy,' said Georgia Detective Kevin Morgan at the bond hearing of Paul and Sheila Comer, who were arrested last month on charges of cruelty to children and false imprisonment. Mitch Comer was just 5' 1"" and weighed only 87 pounds when he was found wandering around downtown Los Angeles. He was so neglected, his skin was translucent and he told investigators he hadn't seen the sun in two years. He said he was confined to a bathroom and bedroom and wasn't fed often, occasionally getting soup or cereal but little of substance, Morgan said. Wawrzynski said he's not sure how much his son knows about him, since he was taken from him at such a young age. He is hoping to reunite with him at a Nov. 10 fundraiser for Mitch in Powder Springs, Georgia, he said. 'I definitely want some time for us to be able to talk and for him to get to know me,' Wawrzynski said. 'My hopes are definitely that I’m gonna have my son back.' Arrest warrants filed in Georgia say the . Comers 'made Mitch kneel on the floor, bend his head and place his . forehead against the wall, and place his hands behind his head for long . periods of time.' In jail: Paul and Sheila Marie Comer allegedly starving and maltreating 18-year-old Mitch, who was found wandering around a bus station more than 2,000 miles from home . Detectives said the 18-year-old boy had practically translucent skin and looked no more than 12 or 13 years old. Pictured, police searching the family home . The Comers' two daughters, who are 11 and 13, told investigators they heard him cry and scream for food often, Morgan said. Paul and Sheila Comer, who had lived in the house 14 months, admitted to investigators that Mitch was confined to the room. 'They both conceded that that was his life,' Morgan said. 'He lived in that room for years.' The boy was kept in such seclusion . that his two younger sisters in the same house did not know what he . looked like, the authorities revealed. 'The . sisters haven't seen the brother in over two years,' said Paulding's . Cpl. Ashley Henson. 'They didn't even know what color his hair was.' Paul . Comer told investigators he brought Mitch Comer food at 7am noon and . 7pm each day and fed him whatever the family was eating. On September 11, a retired police sergeant working security at a downtown Los Angeles bus station noticed Mitch Comer. Police . decided to investigate further because the teen looked much younger . than the 18 years he claimed, Los Angeles police said last month. Parents: Mr Comer and the boy's mother Sheila Marie were arrested on six charges of child abuse and one charge of false imprisonment on September 12, at their home near Dallas . The teen told authorities he had suffered from years of abuse after being taken out of school in the eighth grade. He . told authorities his stepfather gave him $200 and a list of homeless . shelters before he was put on a bus to Los Angeles on his 18th birthday. Paul Comer told investigators Mitch Comer wanted to be an actor. Mr Comer and the boy's mother Sheila Marie were arrested on six charges of child abuse and one charge of false imprisonment on September 12, at their home near Dallas. As an 18-year-old, Mitch was not eligible for foster care, but has been taken in by a local family and is 'doing well', detectives said. He did not know his own address, but his parents . were quickly tracked down. The couple’s two daughters have been in protective custody since their parents were arrested, investigators said. The Comers have no prior criminal . history, but were the subject of a 2009 investigation by local . authorities following an abuse allegation when the family lived in . Cherokee County. The case was referred to the Cherokee Sheriff’s Office, but was later closed, and no charges were filed. Neighbours . on the quiet cul-de-sac of two-story brick and vinyl siding homes, . about 30 miles outside Atlanta, said the couple kept to themselves and were shocked to discover that the family had a son. 'Abuse': Mitch told detectives he was forced to stand against the wall at the family home near Dallas, Georgia, for up to eight hours at a time . The FBI and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation have joined the case, Cpl. Henson added. Mrs Comer’s mother, Diana Powell, of Iowa, said she hadn’t spoken to her daughter in more than a decade and hadn’t seen her grandson since he was a toddler. Powell told the station that she had feared her daughter and husband abused their children but had no direct evidence. 'They mistreated him something terrible. I got on her case about it and she disappeared from my life,’ she said crying. Authorities say that they are just at . the ‘tip of the iceberg’ with the case and more charges could be . brought against the parents. Monica Moore, an investigator with the Paulding County District Attorney’s office, described the 18-year-old victim as small, very timid, and extremely polite. Moore confirmed that a local family had agreed to house the teenager, according to Channel 2. A spokesman from Paulding County Public Schools could also not confirm whether the children have ever been enrolled in the school system. Records show the Comers have lived in almost two dozen different homes during the past two decades. Neighbours said the family had lived at their large Dallas home for at least a few years. Dion Walker and Mea Smith told the Atlanta Journal Constitution that their children had played with the Comers’ daughters over the years but that they had never even seen Mitch. They said they were surprised to learn the family had a son. 'Maybe, when the young girls would stare at us, were they trying to say something?' said Mr Walker. 'Should we have noticed?' Mitch was flown back to Dallas on Wednesday to participate in the investigation and legal proceedings. His stepfather had his own business repairing home appliances, said next-door neighbour John White. They rarely spoke. Mrs Comer never left the house unless she was with her husband, . not even to check the mail, said Mr White. Their two daughters would . sometimes come outside and play, but only in the back yard. Neighbours . assumed the girls didn't go to school either – they never caught the bus . that picked up other children in the cul-de-sac every morning. Neighbors said they had no clue the Comers had a son until a detective came knocking at their doors asking questions last week. 'I had no idea, no clue. There were no signs of a son at all,' said Mr Walker, who has lived next to the Comers for two years. 'The few . occasions we would see them go to the van, it was always the parents and . the two girls.' Walker said police swarmed the Comers' home last week, arresting the parents and taking both girls into protective custody. Walker said the Comer family did not take part in neighbourhood . association meetings and their girls never attended the neighbourhood . Halloween block parties.

Attack: Tony Power, 78, is the founder of top . lingerie firm Panache whose underwear is worn by Hollywood star Scarlett . Johannson, TV presenter Holly Willoughby and Jordan aka Katie Price . A businessman who founded a multi-million-pound lingerie firm is fighting for his life after being beaten and robbed in a park. Police believe the attack on Tony Power, 78, may have been an attempt to steal his £180,000 Bentley Continental, which was parked nearby. The car was not stolen but Mr Power’s iPhone and cash were taken as he lay unconscious. He suffered a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain. Police described his injuries as life-threatening. The attack happened after Mr Power drove to the park – seven miles from his home in Bradway, Sheffield – to look for his elderly brother because he was concerned for his welfare. Police believe he left the Bentley  near the entrance to High Hazels Park between 7.50pm and 8.10pm last Monday and was attacked for his car key. He was found unconscious at 9.10pm and rushed to hospital. Mr Power, who is being treated in the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, made his fortune as he went from selling bras from his garage to supplying lingerie across the globe. His rags to riches tale began in the early 1980s when he was made redundant from Playtex where he worked as a salesman. His commercial brainwave was to realise there was a gap in the market for lingerie aimed at curvier women and he set up his company, Panache, in 1982 with money from mortgaging his house.

For five million years after the worst mass extinction in Earth history, much of the planet was simply too hot for anything to survive, scientists have learned. Experts have long been puzzled by the 'broken world' scenario that followed the Permian-Triassic mass extinction 250 million years ago. Up to 96% of all marine species and 70% of land-dwelling vertebrates were wiped out by the event, thought to have been caused by a combination of climate change and volcanic activity. A paleogeographic reconstruction of the Early Triassic world around 252-247 million years ago, showing a ¿dead zone¿ in the tropics where experts say no life could have existed . Temperatures in the tropics rose to lethal levels, soaring to 60C on land and 40C in the sea, and prevented life re-emerging. During . the long heatwave no forests grew in the tropics, only shrubs and . ferns, and shellfish were the only marine creatures in the oceans. Virtually no land animals existed because their metabolisms would not have withstood such high temperatures. Only the polar regions offered a habitable refuge from the baking heat. Typically it takes tens of thousands of years for new species to appear after a mass extinction. But in the case of the Permian-Triassic event, this 'dead zone' lasted an extraordinary five million years. A new study has now indicated why. Temperatures in the tropics rose to lethal levels, soaring to 60C on land and 40C in the sea, and prevented life re-emerging. 'Global warming has long been linked to the end-Permian mass extinction, but this study is the first to show extreme temperatures kept life from restarting in equatorial latitudes for millions of years,' said lead researcher Yadong Sun, from the University of Leeds. During the long heatwave no forests grew in the tropics, only shrubs and ferns, and shellfish were the only marine creatures in the oceans. Virtually no land animals existed because their metabolisms would not have withstood such high temperatures. Only the polar regions offered a habitable refuge from the baking heat. A breakdown in global carbon cycling was responsible for the hothouse conditions, according to the researchers writing in the journal Science. Normally plants help regulate temperature by absorbing carbon dioxide and sealing it away in vegetable matter. Without plants, levels of the greenhouse gas rose unchecked, causing temperatures to rise. The scientists collected data from 15,000 conodonts - tiny teeth from extinct eel-like fishes - from rocks in southern China.

'Hopefully future global warming won’t get anywhere near temperatures of 250 million years ago, but if it does we have shown that it may take millions of years to recover.'","Experts say 'broken world' that followed the Permian-Triassic mass extinction meant no life for five million years in a huge 'dead zone'

Amid all the finery that the great and the good wore to  St Paul’s Cathedral over the Bank Holiday, the Duchess of Cambridge’s diamond and pearl earrings were among the most admired. So it will come as a surprise to those who spent a fortune on  jewellery at Graff and Asprey that Kate’s sparklers weren’t  diamonds at all — and cost a mere £48. In fact, they were a very good copy under the description ‘fabulous fakes’ designed by Belinda Hadden, ex-wife of top PR man Abel Hadden. She was astonished to learn that Kate had worn her creations on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. Mother-of-three Belinda, who set up little-known Heavenly Necklaces in the Nineties as a hobby when her daughters were small, tells me: ‘I was at a wedding, so I had no idea Kate had worn my earrings until another client sent me an email asking: “Are they the same as mine?” ’ It wasn’t long, however, before the ‘Kate effect’ began to work, with internet chatrooms abuzz. Says Belinda, daughter of the late Tory MP for Gosport and Fareham, Hants, Sir Reginald Bennett: ‘Within the next 24 hours, I had sold out. I sold 60 on my website, which is the amount I would usually sell in a whole year.’ Belinda, who sources her fakes from . India, China and Hatton Garden in London, tells me: ‘They are made of . finest grade cubic zirconia, but what makes them look authentic is the . settings they are in.’ The pearls, says Belinda, are made from ground-up freshwater pearls reconstituted with resin. Sell out: The earrings are now sold out on Mrs Hadden's website . She adds: ‘Usually, I would never dream of talking about my clients but, in this case, Kate’s earrings were outed on various blogs. ‘I had no idea there was this huge internet chat about where, when and what she wears.’ Belinda designs 75 per cent of her earrings, necklaces and bracelets herself and explains: ‘I have always loved jewellery and I did a short design course — two terms — at a further education centre run by my local council.’ Of course, she never dreamed that one day her wares would be on show to the entire nation.","Designed by Belinda Hadden, ex-wife of top PR man Abel Hadden ."

The director of Nasa's Mars exploration programme says he hopes that one day the rover Curiosity might be brought back to Earth by astronauts. Doug McCuistion said it was his personal hope that humans would visit the Red Planet in the 2030s or 2040s. He said he could imagine astronauts walking up to Curiosity. Scroll down for video . A self portrait of Curiosity on Mars . McCuistion said the roving laboratory's mission was scheduled to last two years, but it could have enough power for 20 years. The Nasa chief set out his vision during a satellite link up with Glenelg in the Scottish Highlands at the weekend. The community of about 280 people has twinned itself with a site on Mars that Nasa has labelled Glenelg - 35 million miles away. McCuistion said: 'It is my hope that humans will be sent to Mars in the 2030s, or 2040s, and they will be able to walk up to Curiosity and bring it back, as I am sure there is a museum out there that would love to have it.' Plutonium generators that deliver heat and electricity to Curiosity could continue working long after the rover completes its mission. But McCuistion said wear and tear of working parts were likely to bring an end to Curiosity's life before the generators.

Retired astronaut Bonnie Dunbar, a veteran of five space shuttle flights, also told the event in Glenelg of her desire to see humans on Mars. She said: 'It is not a question of if, but when and who.' Attending the twinning ceremony in person, Dunbar said it was important future generations took an interest in science and maths. Algebra was key to her career as an engineer working on space shuttles, and later as an astronaut flying in them. Dunbar was also keen to debunk suggestions the 1969 Moon Landing was faked. She said: 'At Nasa I worked with John Young, an astronaut who walked on the Moon.' Dunbar added: 'I grew up watching Flash Gordon, which were popular at the time of the landing. In those shows who can see the wires holding up the spaceships.' The former astronaut said wires cannot be seen in the Moon Landing and the special effects were not available 43 years ago to fake the footage.

A TAX-dodging builder who took . cash-in-hand for his entire career told HMRC inspectors when they . knocked on his door, ‘I’ve been waiting for you for 27 years.’ Harry Rowbottom, 58, worked as a . self-employed builder, plumber and gas installer after setting up his . own business in the early 1980s. No job was too small... but he was always paid in cash, which he failed to declare to the taxman for a staggering 27 years. Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs . estimated he owed £117,602, made up of £64,674 in unpaid income tax and . national insurance, plus interest. However, the complete lack of . paperwork and proof of the number of jobs he was paid for means the true . extent of his tax evasion may have been significantly higher. When investigators knocked on his door . during routine inquiries to catch tax-dodging tradesmen, he immediately . admitted responsibility, and said: ‘I’ve been waiting for you for 27 . years.’ His lawyer said he was relieved finally to be caught. Rowbottom was jailed for 14 months at . Grimsby Crown Court this week after pleading guilty to fraud, and was . ordered to pay his dues in full or face a longer term behind bars. He . was also ordered to pay £1,500 costs. Gordon Stables, prosecuting, told the court he was caught by an HMRC campaign centred on self-assessment by plumbers. The drive has already led to £4million in outstanding tax being paid back. The court heard there was evidence of . Rowbottom working around Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire, where he . lived with his partner, but bank accounts revealed that he apparently . had no regular source of income. He was arrested in November last year . and admitted working for cash that was never paid into a bank account. He also admitted not keeping proper records for a property he had owned . since 2001. He also owned plots of land. Judge Robert Moore told him: ‘For 27 years you paid no tax and national insurance. ‘You know the matter is so serious that only a custodial sentence can be justified. ‘Fortunately, the Revenue will get back the capital and interest.’ Richard Hackfath, defending, said Rowbottom had sufficient assets to pay in full and would do so as soon as possible. Caught out: Gordon Stables, prosecuting, told Grimsby Crown Court that Rowbottom was caught as part of a campaign by Revenue and Customs targeting self-assessment by plumbers . Explaining the long-running fraud, he . said: ‘He let matters ride. He was relieved to be caught and to be no . longer listening for a knock on the door from Revenue and Customs.’ An HMRC spokesman said there was no . evidence Rowbottom was living a lavish lifestyle and his was a classic . case of ‘bury your head in the sand syndrome’. She added: ‘A lot of people are paid . in cash but it’s how they declare it that counts. As long as they put it . on their tax return they can get paid how they want.’","Harry Rowbottom, 58, from Barton-Upon-Humber, East Yorkshire, admitted cheating the public revenue between 1983 and 2010 .

Police are investigating allegations that a BBC radio journalist killed himself after being sexually harassed by a female colleague. Russell Joslin, 50, whose father is a former chief constable, suffocated himself last Monday despite being on suicide watch at a psychiatric hospital. His family claim he was driven to his death after bosses at the BBC failed to take seriously allegations that he was being bullied by a female colleague. Gathering information: Police are assisting in establishing the circumstances surrounding the death of Russell Joslin, pictured left in 2008 and right, before his death in a psychiatric hospital last Monday . The woman is said to have targeted . him after he spurned her sexual advances during a night out at a . restaurant in 2007 near his home in affluent Kenilworth, Warwickshire. She allegedly left him a series of abusive phone messages, in which she swore and belittled him. In them, she accused him of being ‘flaky’ and a ‘loser’. ‘Don’t ever ever ever think of me as your mate again. 'Do what you have to at the BBC because you are a loser on 27 grand a year,’ one message said. Mr Joslin had apparently spoken with . the BBC’s occupational health department about the allegations this . spring when he was off work sick with stress. Mr Joslin’s father, Peter, the . retired chief constable of Warwickshire, has called for the BBC to act . and a corporation spokesman says it will hold an investigation to . establish the facts. His family have welcomed the involvement of the police as 'the first step towards justice for Russell'. Yesterday, Warwickshire Police confirmed they had been asked by Russell’s father Peter - a former chief constable who led the force for 44 years - to investigate allegations his son was sexually harassed and bullied by the woman. A force spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm that Warwickshire Police is assisting the coroner in establishing the circumstances of Mr Joslin’s death, including gathering information from the family which is normal practice in these matters. 'As such we are working with, and will be led by, the coroner who is responsible for conducting an inquest into the circumstances of Mr Joslin’s death.' 'It's what he would have wanted': Joslin's Father, Peter, 78, a retired chief constable, welcomed the involvement of the Police . A statement from Joslin’s family said: 'This is what Russell would have wanted. It is the first step towards justice for Russell.' Joslin's parents had previously blamed the BBC for failing to prevent his death. After calling for a BBC inquiry, the . family called for an independent inquiry into whether the . corporation’s management properly responded to Russell’s complaints . about the alleged sexual harassment. It has emerged that Joslin, who lived in a flat next door to his parents’ home in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, had received a text message in error from a BBC chief days before his death. The text, from BBC West Midlands’ head of programmes Cath Hearne to Russell, read: 'However, do not contact him until he gets back to me. This is massively sensitive.' Joslin's family say his descent into mental illness began after he allegedly spurned unwanted sexual advances by the woman broadcaster during a night out at a restaurant near his home in affluent Kenilworth, Warwickshire. Mr Joslin’s parents said he was forced to leave her in the restaurant because of her behaviour, after which she sent him a flurry of abusive phone messages which have been played to the Daily Mail and in which she swore and belittled him. Peter Joslin said that while questions need to be asked at the hospital over how his son was apparently able to take his own life, the BBC should hold an investigation into his treatment. Mr Joslin, 78, added: ‘There is some evidence to support accusations that Russell was being sexually harassed or bullied. ‘I am shocked to discover the apparent attitudes of certain individuals to their employees at the BBC. ‘I believe he was ignored by his bosses, despite outlining his concerns about the particular staff member he claimed had sexually harassed him. ‘He enjoyed his work at the BBC but in recent years the situation had become intolerable for him there.’ Mr Joslin, who lives with wife Kathy next door to their son’s home, retired in 1998 after 44 years’ service – the longest-serving policeman ever in the UK. He said his son’s alleged ‘sexual harassment’ by the female colleague at BBC Coventry and Warwickshire was the ‘trigger’ which caused his mental illness. There had been ‘plenty of opportunities’ for managers to intervene after he complained, but ‘nothing was done to help him’. Mr Joslin said he felt more should have been done to pick up the problems as his son was clearly quite distressed. Their son was admitted to St Michael’s psychiatric hospital in Warwick on Friday after suffering minor injuries when he walked in to the road and was hit by a bus in an apparent suicide attempt. Mr Joslin senior said the hospital ‘specialises in people who are at high risk of committing suicide and he was checked every 15 minutes.’ He was found choking on Sunday and taken to nearby Warwick Hospital, where he was pronounced dead the following afternoon. St Michael's hospital where Russell Joslin was admitted for help and later found dead . His family and his ex-girlfriend, Lucy Poulson, claimed that after propositioning him in the restaurant, the woman – no longer at the station – began targeting him in other ways at work, deliberately cutting him off while he was on air. It is understood that Mr Joslin, a bachelor who covered south Warwickshire for the station, first complained about her to management after she sent him an unpleasant email. He is thought to have approached bosses again early this year to complain about being sidelined at the station, concerned he had been overlooked for news reading and presenting opportunities. Miss Poulson said he then became consumed by worry and stress ‘because he knew that people don’t go very far by speaking out against organisations like the BBC’. He was diagnosed with depression and suffered a breakdown soon afterwards. Miss Poulson, 28, a freelance theatre director, told the Daily Mail that the BBC had paid for him to receive counselling. Russell Joslin recorded the following three messages from his female colleague after he left her in the restaurant. ‘Thanks . a lot, you’ve p***** on your chips. I’m trying to get a taxi to . Coventry. Thanks for abandoning me. Don’t ever ever ever think of me as . your mate again. Do what you have to at the BBC because you are a loser . on 27 grand a year. But don’t ever ever encroach on me or my talent.’ ‘Hi, . it’s me. I’m in a taxi from Kenilworth to Coventry. Russell, don’t ever . count on me as a friend. I’m going home. Please don’t think you can . rely on me – you’ve insulted me. You have left me stranded in . Kenilworth. You are flaky, you are poor, you are weak. I don’t want . anything to do with you except on the radio. Goodbye.’‘Hi, it’s 9.21. I’m back at my car. Don’t ever ever ever presume friendship with me again, all right? Goodbye.’ His GP and the corporation’s own occupational health specialist all advised him not to return to work at the station for the good of his health. But despite this bosses told him he would have to return full time before he could think about transferring to another station. Mr Joslin eventually went back to work three months later, but on a part-time basis. Miss Poulson said she split from Mr Joslin in 2010, after four years together, but the pair remained close. She said that in recent months he had been ‘the happiest I had known him’ and was considering returning to freelance journalism. She said that for years he felt unable to speak out against his tormentor. When he finally did pluck up the courage to speak out, she said the office climate left him fearful for his job and future. Miss Poulson added: ‘Russell told me that this woman treated many people badly at the station, but nothing was done because of her senior status. 'It seemed everybody was scared to tackle her. People need to know that this culture still exists – of allowing certain individuals to be in control, when others don’t seem to matter.’ Neither Warwickshire Police, responsible for policing in Kenilworth, or West Midlands Police, which covers Coventry, could find any record of Mr Joslin reporting the alleged harassment. The woman he accused said there was never a complaint against her and she denied any wrongdoing. She said she was asked by managers to try to help him. She told the Daily Mail: ‘I got a message to say Russell had died. I’m really upset about it and can’t say any more.’ Told of the Joslin family’s allegations that his illness had been triggered by her alleged behaviour, she said: ‘I don’t know what you are talking about’ and put the phone down. Mr Joslin’s colleagues are being offered counselling by the BBC. His funeral is to be held on Wednesday. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Our thoughts and condolences are with Russell Joslin’s family at this sad time. 'This is a difficult time for everyone who knew him. 'The BBC is committed to working constructively with the family to ensure that their concerns are vigorously addressed. It would not be appropriate to comment further until the facts are established.’ An inquest into Mr Joslin’s death was opened yesterday at the Warwickshire Justice Centre in Leamington Spa. Coroner Sean McGovern was told the radio presenter died of ‘asphyxiation’.

It is the first time an 'exact match' of the Milky Way, our own galaxy, has been found in our local universe. The discovery was made using the Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey (GAMA), a project that brings . together data from six telescopes to build a . 3D map of galaxies in our local universe. This image shows one of the two ¿exact matches¿ to the Milky Way system found in the survey. The larger galaxy, denoted GAMA202627, which is similar to the Milky Way clearly has two large companions off to the bottom left of the image. The research was presented today at the International Astronomical Union General Assembly in Beijing unveiled the rare sight. The team released an image showing one of the two ‘exact matches’ to the Milky Way system found in the survey. The larger galaxy, denoted GAMA202627, which is similar to the Milky Way clearly has two large companions off to the bottom left of the image (above). In the image bluer colours indicate hotter, younger, stars like many of those that are found in our galaxy. The Milky Way is a fairly typical galaxy on its own, the team said, but when paired with its close neighbours - the Magellanic Clouds - it is very rare, and could have been one of a kind. Astronomer Dr Aaron Robotham, jointly from the University of Western Australia node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) and the University of St Andrews in Scotland, searched for groups of galaxies similar to ours in the most detailed map of the local Universe yet, the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey (GAMA). 'We’ve never found another galaxy system like the Milky Way before, which is not surprising considering how hard they are to spot,' said Dr  Robotham. It’s only recently become possible to do the type of analysis that lets us find similar groups. The Milky Way: Scientists have now discovered two galaxies in our universe they say are 'exact matches' 'Everything had to come together at once: we needed telescopes good enough to detect not just galaxies but their faint companions, we needed to look at large sections of the sky, and most of all we needed to make sure no galaxies were missed in the survey” Sophisticated simulations of how galaxies form don’t produce many examples similar to the Milky Way and its surrounds, predicting them to be quite a rare occurrence. Astronomers haven’t been able to tell just how rare until now, with the discovery of not just one but two exact matches amongst the hundreds of thousands of galaxies surveyed. 'We found about 3% of galaxies similar to the Milky Way have companion galaxies like the Magellanic Clouds, which is very rare indeed. 'In total we found 14 galaxy systems that are similar to ours, with two of those being an almost exact match,' says Dr Robotham. The Milky Way is locked in a complex cosmic dance with its close companions the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, which are clearly visible in the southern hemisphere night sky. Many galaxies have smaller galaxies in orbit around them, but few have two that are as large as the Magellanic Clouds. Dr Robotham’s work also found that although companions like the Magellanic Clouds are rare, when they are found they’re usually near a galaxy very like the Milky Way, meaning we’re in just the right place at the right time to have such a great view in our night sky. 'The galaxy we live in is perfectly typical, but the nearby Magellenic Clouds are a rare, and possibly short-lived, occurrence. 'We should enjoy them whilst we can, they'll only be around for a few billion more years,' said Dr Robotham. Dr Robotham and colleagues have been awarded further time on telescopes in New South Wales and Chile to study these Milky Way twin systems now that they’ve been found.","Unique find is first time galaxy systems identical to the Milky Way have been found in our local universe .

A group of teenage girls staged a protest outside Teen Vogue's offices on Wednesday, asking the fashion magazine to publicly commit to using 'Photoshop-free, diverse images of real girls.' Holding signs and walking arm-in-arm, Carina Cruz and Emma Stydahar of the girl-fueled Spark Movement, staged a mock runway show in the middle of Times Square in an effort to give the editors, and the world, an idea of what real girls look like. The girls were allowed to meet with Teen Vogue editors, where they handed over a . petition with more than 20,000 signatures, however the teenagers told Jezebel the magazine's reaction was not what they were expecting. Runway protest: Demanding that Teen Vogue use real girls and healthy looking models, 14-year-old protesters held a mock fashion show before delivering deliver 20,000 anti-Photoshop signatures . They explained: 'We walked in, there was no handshake, no ""my name is"", none of that. Just, ""you sit here, you sit there. So you wanted this meeting - what do you want to say?"" We said what is in our petition… They proceeded to take out handfuls of magazines with little Post-It notes in them, [marking] what they perceived to be diverse images. 'Most of them were thin African-American models. It was a good start - we love seeing women of color in these magazines. But two or three an issue - and all of them super stick skinny - isn't what we're looking for.' Emma added that the meeting consisted of the editors telling the teenagers that they hadn't 'done their homework', and that 'Teen Vogue is a great magazine, being unfairly accused.' Both Emma and Carina were inspired by 14-year-old fellow Spark member Julia Bluhm's recent quest and anti-Photoshop protest against Seventeen magazine. Some success: After 14-year-old fellow Spark member Julia Bluhm staged an anti-Photoshop protest against Seventeen magazine, the editor-in-chief publicly responded (left), which inspired the Teen Vogue protest (right) After she delivered a petition with 25,000 signatures to ban Photoshop from the magazine, the editors publicly promised not to alter girls' faces or bodies. However, at the same time, Seventeen magazine didn't outright agree to stop Photoshopping its models and celebrity subjects, and also did not commit to publishing any un-retouched photo spreads. Miss Bluhm's crusade, while not wholly successfully, was still met with public consideration by the magazine's editor-in-chief, Ann Shoket, surrounding the points the 14-year-old brought forward. And as Jezebel noted, when Miss Bluhm met with editors at Seventeen, there were cupcakes and a tour of the office. Teen Vogue: The girls asked for the magazine to stop altering natural bodies and faces . Unfortunately, it seems Teen Vogue has forgotten who its readers are - these young girls. Jezebel wrote: 'What Emma and Carina are asking for goes beyond banning Photoshop. They want a wider variety of faces, disclosure if a pimple is removed - a magazine they can relate to.' As it states in their petition, the girls only want magazines to stop altering natural bodies and faces so that real girls can be 'the new standard of beauty'. The petition continues: 'It's time for an end to the digitally enhanced, unrealistic ""beauty"" we see in the pages of magazines.' The girls also explained their reason for targeting Teen Vogue, simply because they see the magazine as the leader in its teen-targeted field, with the most power to affect change.Teen Vogue’s Senior Public Relations Director, Erin Kaplan, said in a statement: 'Teen Vogue makes a conscious and continuous effort to promote a positive body image among our readers. 'We feature healthy models on the pages of our magazine and shoot dozens of non-models and readers every year and do not retouch them to alter their body size.

'It was very stressful — a conviction . could have spelled the end of my medical career before it has even . begun. I have no previous convictions and I find it incredible how much . money and resources have been wasted on this case – with Lancashire and . Derbyshire police involved, plus my £1,500 legal fees, paid for out of . legal aid because I am a student. 'Why would I risk my five-year . university course – which costs me around £8,000 a year in accommodation . alone – to make just £140? Why would I try to con someone? 'The whole affair is ridiculous. I feel like the victim and I plan to sue the police for what they did.' Mr Quayum's ordeal began last May when he sold the Beats by Dr Dre headphones to a buyer from Lancashire. The customer later told him they had . not arrived and Mr Quayum, who is studying at St George's, University of . London, offered a refund 'three or four times', on the understanding . that he would be able to claim the value of the lost item back from . Royal Mail himself. 'Misunderstanding': Faris was charged with fraud, but he claims the headphones just got lost in the post . He did not, however, alert the Royal Mail. The buyer . refused to accept the offer and two months later two police officers . arrived at Mr Quayum's family home in Littleover, Derby, where he was . revising for exams. He said they urged him to 'admit what . you have done' and that the matter could be resolved by paying back the . buyer. Mr Quayum refused and was charged with fraud. His bank statements . were seized along with his phone and computer. He said: 'Police knocked on my door . and told me the matter would be quickly dealt with if I just admitted . I'd taken the money and not sent the goods. Faris was arrested at his home in Littleover, Derbyshire (file picture) 'The buyer specifically . declined the option of paying an extra £15 to have the headphones sent . by special delivery because he only wanted to pay £5 for normal postage. 'I've sold hundreds of items in the past through eBay and never had a problem. I've never ripped anyone off in my life.' Mr Quayum's ordeal only ended on . September 10, when he arrived at Derby magistrates' court to be told . that witnesses had declined to make a statement and that prosecutors . considered the incident a civil rather than a criminal matter. However, . his laptop – containing his coursework – and other belongings were not . returned for another five weeks. A CPS spokesman said: 'Following a review, it was decided that there was no longer a realistic prospect of a conviction.' An eBay spokesman said it worked with law enforcement agencies when necessary. Royal Mail spokesman James Eadie said: . 'We would always encourage anyone sending items of value, or where . confirmation of delivery is required, to use the appropriate tracked . service.'","Buyer said the Dr Dre headphones never arrived, but 'ignored' refund offer .

Guilty: Stephen Pardon was jailed for four months for being in contempt of court . A juror was jailed yesterday for contacting a defendant in a £2million theft trial. Stephen Pardon, 42, went to the accused's workplace to tell him his fellow jurors had illegally looked up the case on the internet. Ian Lewis and two other men had been found guilty of one theft charge but the jury was deadlocked and unable to reach a verdict on a second related charge. The trio have now appealed against their convictions, citing the behaviour of the jury. If they succeed there is likely to be a re-trial that would cost £1million. Pardon, who is a lorry driver, had told Lewis that jury members had researched newspaper stories about the case as well as trawling the internet. He went to the work premises of another defendant, Anthony Geeling, but was unable to speak to him. Lewis told his lawyers about Pardon's actions and they informed the judge at Wolverhampton Crown Court. After he was arrested Pardon told police he had been stupid but was worried about a 'miscarriage of justice' and 'felt sorry' for the accused. The trial, which ended last December after 13 weeks, concerned a plot to steal £2million of metal. Pardon, of Tipton, West Midlands, yesterday admitted contempt of court in a case Attorney General Dominic Grieve referred to the High Court  in London. Passing a four-month prison sentence, Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge emphasised the 'seriousness with which this court will view any incident which serves to undermine our system of trial by jury'. He added: 'This contempt involved deliberate disobedience. In these circumstances an immediate custodial sentence is virtually inevitable.' Lord Judge told Pardon that he knew 'perfectly well' that he should have voiced his concerns to the trial judge rather than the defendants. Jonathan Challinor, defending Pardon, said: 'It is right Mr Pardon disobeyed a clear and unambiguous direction from the trial judge. Attorney General Dominic Grieve (pictured) referred the matter to the High Court where Pardon was found guilty . That was a matter which Mr Pardon candidly and straight-forwardly admitted when interviewed by police.' He added that Pardon had acted in good faith. Following the hearing, Mr Grieve said: 'There is a compelling public interest in addressing any contempt of judicial process. 'Mr Pardon's conduct had serious consequences and as a result the three convicted defendants appealed against their convictions – convictions won after a lengthy police investigation and trial.' Lewis, 46, of Stourbridge, West Midlands, Geeling, 62, of Studley, Warwickshire, and David Fellows, 59, of Blakedown, Worcestershire, have asked the Court of Appeal to overturn their convictions. A fourth defendant was found not guilty of the same theft charge. The jury was discharged when they could not reach a verdict on a second charge relating to an attempt to steal metal beer kegs. In January, a university lecturer who researched a defendant's past on the internet was jailed for six months. Theodora Dallas, 34, turned to the web while trying a man for grievous bodily harm and found he had once been acquitted of rape. Dallas shared her findings with fellow jurors at Luton Crown Court.","Stephen Pardon spoke to a defendant accused of plotting to steal £2million worth of metal .

It's the sort of delightfully innocent exchange that plays out between young siblings every day. But four-year-old Delilah O’Donoghue’s earnest lecture on behaviour to her two-year-old brother Gabriel could be about to make their family a fortune. Last night their father Lee told how he had initially posted a 65-second video clip of his children on YouTube thinking simply that friends and  family could find it amusing. Tough love: Delilah O'Donoghue reprimands her younger brother Gabriel for spitting at another boy . Straight-talking: A frowning Gabriel fiddles awkwardly with his hands as big sister Delilah tells him off . Within days it had become an internet sensation, attracting more than half a million viewers as well as requests for interviews from media outlets here and in America. Mr O’Donoghue and wife Alex, from Balsall Common, West Midlands, last night described the interest in the video as ‘surreal’. The 42-year-old said he began filming on his smartphone about two minutes into the little girl’s scolding. ‘I watched from afar until I realised he must be really getting it from her,’ he said. ‘In classic Delilah style she decides to give it to him straight.’ Mrs O’Donoghue, 40, a teacher, said of their daughter: ‘Delilah’s very bossy – it’s how little girls are, I think. ‘She has scolded Gabriel in the  past. But it is as much about trying to teach him. They are good little buddies really.’ In demand: Alex and Lee O'Donoghue described the reaction to a video of their children as 'surreal' The clip shows Gabriel receiving the dressing down from his sister after he found himself in hot water with their father for spitting at another child in the playground. Delilah was quickly on hand with sisterly advice – some of which belies her young years. ‘I’ll keep remembering you being about two and I’ll tell my friends that too,’ she tells him. ‘You’re nearly three, you should toughen up a bit.’ As the lecture continues, Gabriel hangs his head, swings his legs, fidgets with his hands and looks away. She tells him: ‘When Mum and Dad said you don’t do that, you don’t do that... and you don’t spit.’ Referring to the child with whom Gabriel had apparently had the playground spat, she adds: ‘That boy’s old enough. You’re only two. ‘You’re not old enough for that boy to... do a fight. ‘That boy’s older than you. Maybe he’s nine or ten...or maybe eight.’ Delilah completes her reprimand with the words: ‘Think about it, Gabriel. Think about it.’ Mr O’Donoghue, a company director, said he posted the clip, titled You Need to Toughen Up A Bit, on YouTube last Tuesday. He said: ‘I’m not the sort of father who follows my children around with a digital camcorder. I just spotted it and thought it was comedy gold.’ He and his wife have now signed up with global video marketing company Viral Spiral, which represents hundreds of home-movie makers with the aim of maximising profits from clips posted online. The couple said they had not decided how to proceed with marketing linked to the video, saying their first concern is the impact any deal would have on their children. The most viewed viral video of  all time is of another pair of  British siblings. The clip, called Charlie Bit My Finger, shows a little boy having his finger bitten by his baby brother and has been viewed more than 480million times since it was posted in 2007. Their parents, Howard and Shelley Davies-Carr, from Buckinghamshire, also represented by Viral Spiral, have earned about £100,000 from advertising revenue and marketing deals. By yesterday, 593,000 YouTube viewers had clicked on Delilah and Gabriel’s video.

First, Billy Idol rolls up in a limo and tells him to hop in. There are women everywhere. And later, when the British rock icon takes the stage and rips into Rebel Yell, 1,800 of his closest friends go wild. Far-fetched? Maybe not. After a two-year campaign to get his far-flung friends together for a great time, the irrepressible Seattle man has actually persuaded Idol to play his birthday party on Friday night. Hear from the mega-fan below . Rebel Yell: Michael Henrichsen, 26, has convinced 80s icon Billy Idol to play at his birthday party on Friday in Seattle . 'This is surreal,' Henrichsen says. 'It should not be happening.' So why is it? In his bedroom, surrounded by Cyndi Lauper and Madonna records, a drumstick he picked up at an Idol show two years ago, and rock posters, Henrichsen explains: . In October 2010, he had just turned 24 and was having an early life crisis. Friends were getting married and moving away. He was working three jobs and making little progress paying off $40,000 in college loans. Salvation came over the stereo at the Bellevue Square Mall's Billabong clothing store, where he worked. It was White Wedding. Henrichsen turned to a coworker: 'Wouldn't it be cool if we got Billy Idol to play at my birthday party?' She laughed. He laughed. No way, right? But he went home and thought about it. He loved the way Idol blended pop and rock. Idol seemed like a fun guy. Rock and roll dreams: Billy Idol on stage in LA (with The Who's Pete Townsend, right) Perseverance: Michael Henrichsen with the website where he enlisted the help of friends and celebrities to convince Idol to play his party . Henrichsen loves other music from the '80s, but he couldn't see Prince or Duran Duran agreeing. Idol, who lives in Los Angeles, wouldn't even have to leave his time zone. Scoring Idol could also be a major coup for his resume. Henrichsen isn't sure what he wants to do for a career - something in entertainment or event planning or PR, maybe - but he thought this could get it started. 'I'm like, how feasible is it?' he says. 'I realized it would cost a lot of money, something I don't have, so that's where the creativity came into play. 'How do you network to convince Billy Idol that it would be a good idea for him to come play a show on a specific date in Seattle?' The first step was getting a friend, Jim Stamper, to build him a website - playmybirthdaybillyidol.com. 'I thought it was never gonna work,' Stamper says. Wannabe: Henrichsen himself has a band called Nite Wave who play 80s covers . The next step was to get people to look at the website. Henrichsen hauled a boom box through a deserted Pike Place Market at night, dancing as Mony Mony blared, then posted a video of it. He and friends held a banner over Interstate 5. But the site didn't start getting much attention until he decided to collect some celebrity endorsements. Comedian . Kevin Nealon came to town to do stand-up, and Henrichsen got him on a . 12-second video, telling Idol: 'You gotta come to Seattle next October . to do ...' 'Michael,' Henrichsen prompts. '... Michael's birthday. It's gonna be awesome.' Endorsements . from other B- and C-listers followed: musician Rick Springfield, former . Seattle Mariner Jay Buhner, porn star Ron Jeremy. Hanging out at book signings and . other celebrity appearances became a fourth job. Only Nikki Sixx from . Motley Crue and comedian Tom Green turned him down. Local . media outlets started to notice. And the Google news alerts made their . way to Idol's people. They called Henrichsen and told him the campaign . was cool, but that they couldn't promise anything. 'When . we first became aware of Michael's project we were inclined to see it . as just another extreme idea from a well-meaning fan,'"" said Idol's . manager, Tony Dimitriades. Tribute: Rebel Yell, Idol's hit track, tops a set list for Michael Henrichsen's cover band . 'But as Michael's campaign continued, his persistence and resourcefulness won Billy over.' It took a while, though. In the meantime Henrichsen, who sings, plays guitar and does a passable Idol impersonation, put together an '80s cover band, Nite Wave. They began playing a series of charity concerts dubbed Billy Idol Aid and raised more than $10,000 for the American Red Cross and Northwest Harvest, which supplies meals to food banks. But when October 2011 came around, Idol didn't show. Instead, he sent a video, saying he was sorry he couldn't make it - but there was always next year. Though some friends and family were a bit tired of the project, Henrichsen decided to give it one more year. He had bimonthly chats with Idol's people to update them on his status. Eventually, the Showbox, a Seattle venue that hosted some of the Billy Idol Aid events, made an offer to host the event at its location south of downtown. Finally, last August, Idol's people called from Japan, where he was touring, and said Idol was in, with his band. Henrichsen says he started screaming and running laps around the mall. And when 900-plus people showed up for Billy Idol Aid IV, they were treated to an official video announcement from the man himself. 'The people of the world have spoken!' Idol thundered. 'The dream will become reality ....' 'It's gonna be pretty much the coolest night ever,' says Henrichsen, whose birthday was Monday. 'We'll have as much fun as possible before we get to the 9-5 part of my life.'","Michael Henrichsen, 26, campaigned for two years to have the 80s icon play his birthday party in Seattle ."

With internet maps evolving so much in the last few years - and now becoming photo-realistic 3D - there seems little fresh territory left to explore, so Google has been doing some internalising. The search engine has been plotting the insides of public venues across the UK, allowing Android smartphone users the ability to navigate around areas such as Kings Cross Station or the Selfridges shopping department in London. The locations are currently very London-centric, although the search engine plans to roll out more venues across the UK shortly. Microsoft's search competitor Bing has also begun mapping the inside world, with Bing Maps allowing you to explore nearly all major shopping centres across the UK. Google spokesman Razia Ahamed said: 'Given the current British . weather, we seem to be spending a lot more of the summer than we’d hoped . indoors. 'The thing about being indoors is that people often get lost - .

'Next, search for the location you’d like to get to and we’ll provide directions to help you get there - even if you’re on a . completely different floor.' Google has released a list of their supported venues here. Ahamed added: 'More than 40 venues in the UK have . worked with us to have their indoor floor plans appear on Google, . ranging from train stations to art galleries, department stores to . sporting venues. 'In fact, any building owner can upload their maps for . future inclusion in Google Maps.' Kings Cross and Euston are both plotted, and a toggle ('M', 'G') lets you move between different floor levels . Visiting the O2? Maps offers the ability to browse the popular gig venue .

Pride: Barbara Ray has been threatened with 12 months in prison for fly tipping after she swept leaves into the road outside her home for a council road sweeper to collect . A grandmother of four has been threatened with jail for sweeping the leaves outside her home. Barbara Ray, 82, was accused of 'causing a hazard' by brushing the fallen leaves into a 'large heap' for roadsweepers to collect. She was warned her simple attempts to keep the neighbourhood tidy could leave her facing prosecution for fly-tipping, punishable by a £50,000 fine and a 12-month jail term. When Mrs Ray queried the letter, she was astonished to discover council contractors had photographed her gardener, who visits once a fortnight, sweeping the leaves into the street. And the council even defended its stance by claiming that her behaviour was 'unacceptable'. Mrs Ray, who worked as the financial director of a printing business she ran with her late husband, branded the council officials ‘petty bureaucrats’ as she told of her anger over the letter’s threatening tone. She said: ‘It’s bureaucracy gone mad. I’m not a person who wants to make a fuss but it was a shock to read that letter. ‘When I challenged the district council officer and asked him how he knew I’d cleared the leaves into the road from the front of my house, he said they had photos to prove it. ‘I like to keep my house neat and tidy. The council told me to use my green bin – but that is soon full of garden waste because they only empty it once a fortnight. I’m just annoyed that the council can treat me like this.’ The mother of two first moved to her part of Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, in the 1950s with her husband Tony, who died of cancer in 1997 at the age of 71. Following his death she moved round the corner to her three-bedroom bungalow, which is in a road lined with lime trees. Leafy: Mrs Ray's tree-lined street in Stratford-upon-Avon. The grandmother-of-four has lived in the area for 50 years . In a letter sent last week, an official from the district council warned Mrs Ray: ‘You were seen removing leaves from your front garden and depositing them in the road channel in front of your property. ‘Abandoning material in this manner constitutes fly-tipping under section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which is punishable by a fine of up to £50,000 and/or 12 months’ imprisonment.’ A spokesman for the authority told the Daily Mail yesterday that during the autumn, road sweepers are sent once a week to 100 of the worst roads for leaf fall in the district – one of which is Mrs Ray’s. But she claims the sweepers do not come ‘for weeks’ at a time, so she frequently has to sweep up the leaves from her garden, driveway and the footpath. Neat and tidy: Mrs Ray says that the council have told her to use her green bin but she says that is often too full as it is only empty once a fortnight . Mrs Ray said: ‘I’ve lived through the war and have been in this town all my life. I pay my council tax and should receive this service. I’ve got better things to worry about at my age than this.’ Her family have also played a significant role in the town. Her husband acted as mace bearer for the mayor, while his brother, Malcolm, and father, Ernest, were both mayors in their time. Mrs Ray said the council has now dropped its threat to prosecute after she promised to stop the sweeping. She turned down the authority’s offer to supply her with a second green bin – for a £35 charge. She will now put the leaves into refuse sacks, which a friend will drive to the council waste disposal centre. A council spokesman said the ‘very large heap’ of leaves from Mrs Ray’s lawn which had been left in the ‘road channel’ were a ‘hazard’, which caused cars to move further into the road. He added: ‘Moving the leaves in this manner is unacceptable and can cause additional problems with blocking of drains. The District Council would like to apologise if the letter sent to Mrs Ray caused any concern.’ He added that the letter had been addressed to ‘The Household’, not Mrs Ray herself. Her local MP, Conservative Nadhim Zahawi said he was 'disappointed' about the council's action. He said: 'As Mrs Ray's Member of Parliament it's my job to represent people like her, particularly in dealing with local bureaucracy and issues with the Council and as such it's a shame I wasn't able to get involved in this case. 'I'm particularly disappointed that the Council's Officers seem to have chosen such a confrontational approach from the outset rather than perhaps asking her local  Councillor to intervene or simply sending a less threatening warning letter.'","Council warned Barbara Ray the tidying-up was 'hazard' to cars using road .

It was rather like the X Factor going around the country. Can you imagine the X Factor judges rounding up the contestants and asking for sexual favours after the show? I don’t think so.’ Miss Kershaw joined Radio 1 shortly after Savile’s departure, but said colleagues constantly joked about his behaviour. She said: ‘With all the piety about him when he died last year I was rather sickened, and I thought “why don’t people say what he was really like?” DJ Dave Lee Travis, nicknamed The Hairy Monster, is another star from the 1980s facing accusations. In an article written after interviewing Travis in June, Sunday Times reporter Camilla Long, described how ‘over 90 minutes I don’t think there was a part of my body he did not grope’. She added: ‘He fondled my foot, inched his hands up my thighs, tried to make me sit on his lap and kissed me.

Fighting strength: General Sir David Richards says the Government wants the same level of operations from a vastly reduced number of service personnel . The head of the Armed Forces has warned that defence cuts have left him unable to carry out everything the Government demands. Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir David Richards said ministers’ demands had not been revised to correspond with the reduced size of the Armed Forces. ‘We have a whole load of tasks expected of us,’ he said in an Oxford University lecture. ‘Our political masters are quite happy to reduce the size of the Armed Forces, but their appetite to exercise influence on the world stage is, quite understandably, the same as it has always been. ‘Often politicians say to me, “can you go and do this?” I say to them, “with what?”,’ the Daily Telegraph reported. His comments will fuel concerns that the Strategic Defence and Security Review, which heralded an 8 per cent cut in real-terms funding and reductions in manpower totalling 30,000 personnel, has significantly curbed Britain’s ability to project influence in the world. Speaking to Oxford’s department of politics and international relations, Sir David added: ‘If you reduce your Armed Forces, there is going to be a give - something gives.’ He also expressed anxiety about the number of frigates and destroyers possessed by the Royal Navy, saying that was one of his ‘biggest concerns'. The use of advanced warships for comparatively minor operations like Operation Atalanta, an anti-piracy initiative in the Indian Ocean, because of a lack of ships was troubling, he said. He told the Daily Telegraph: 'You get to this ridiculous situation where in Operation Atalanta off the Somali coast, we have £1billion destroyers trying to sort out pirates in a little dhow with RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades) costing $50, with an outboard motor (costing) $100. 'That can't be good. We've got to sort it out.' He also criticised the failure to find a ‘political resolution’ in Afghanistan despite the opportunities afforded by the military. ‘All the military can do is buy space and time and opportunity for a political resolution of a problem. It is a great shame that we have not understood this. This is not a matter for military, diplomats, politicians. This is a matter of collectively failing to exploit the opportunity the military gained,’ he said. Waning: The general added that the fleet's reduced numbers means state-of-the-art warships are being pitched against Somali pirates in wooden boats . The general also blasted plans to slash the number of senior officers. MPs have claimed the forces are top-heavy, but Sir David siad fewer senior officers makes liaising between services, vital as Britian's military night shrinks, much more difficult. In a statement issued by the Ministry of Defence last night, the Chief of the Defence Staff insisted that the military capability required under the defence review could be achieved with the resources available, but said ‘candid military analysis ensured ministers were aware of the constraints. Sir David said: ‘The nature of military operations is that need is always balanced against available resources. War: The opportunity presented by successful operations in Afghanistan have not been seized by Nato, Sir David added (file picture) 'It is the job of senior military commanders to help the government assess those priorities against the resources available, especially in the current economic conditions. ‘It is right that candid military analysis keeps the Government aware of constraints while the Government, rightly, seeks to achieve the maximum effect with the assets available. 'As I have said before, I and the Chiefs of Staff agree that we can deliver the military capability required by the SDSR with the resources available. ‘On Afghanistan, we all agree that you cannot win an insurgency through military means alone, it has always been understood that a political solution will ultimately be required.’","General Sir David Richards says too much is demanded from fewer troops .

A mother told her two-year-old son how proud she was of him only seconds before an out-of-control car mounted the pavement and crushed her to death. Desreen Brooks’s husband managed to push the boy’s pram clear of the Mercedes but could do nothing to save his wife. Distraught Ben Dutton, 33, said last night: ‘I reacted to save my son and it ended in tragedy. It could have been all three of us.’ Desreen Brooks, 33, right from East Dulwich, died after colliding with a car on Saturday evening. Her husband Ben Dutton, left, managed to save the life of their two year old son . Mr Dutton said he, his wife, also 33, and their son Jackson had spent ‘a lovely day’ with friends in Hampstead, north-west London, on Saturday. They were setting off home to Dulwich, south London when the tragedy happened. ‘On our way home I remember we were struggling to push Jackson along in his pram. He really hates the thing,’ he said. ‘She had bent down to say to him that he had been such a good, well-behaved boy all day and that she was so proud of him. She turned to me and you could see she was so proud of him. Those were last words she ever said.’ Mr Dutton, managing director of London public relations agency Mischief, added: ‘The next thing the car was coming towards us and I pushed Jackson out of the way. It was all a bit of a blur. It all happened so quickly. ‘The next thing I remember was the emergency services coming and Des was taken away. There was no need for an ambulance, it was too late by that point.’ Another woman, American student Amy Werner, 23, was also hit by the car, and was badly injured. The Mercedes then collided with a garden wall. The demolished wall by the house on West End Lane in West Hampstead where the car crash look place on Saturday night . Mr Dutton and Ms Brooks had just left the house of friends Zac and Laura Schwarz having spent the day with them and were making their way back to East Dulwich .

Miss Werner, a postgraduate student at the University of Westminster studying events and conference management, was yesterday in a ‘critical but stable’ condition in the intensive care unit at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, west London, police said. Her parents were by her bedside after flying to London. Miss Werner was left with bleeding on the brain and broken bones in her lower left leg, her upper left arm and in her pelvis and face, a friend wrote on Facebook. The car’s driver, an 83-year-old man, was taken to hospital with minor injuries after the crash, which happened at 8.40pm on Saturday. Police are examining his car and say there have been no arrests. Mr Dutton met his wife eight years ago in the queue at Fabric nightclub in central London. They married in August last year. Earlier this year, Ms Brooks launched fashion management company Saint Luke Artists. Paying tribute to his wife, Mr Dutton said: ‘She was an amazing wife and an amazing mother. Jackson worshipped the ground she walked on. She was a beautiful woman both inside and out. I loved her so much. I still can’t believe she’s gone.’","Husband saved the little boy but mother was killed instantly .

Doctors could save the NHS money by using internet services such as Skype to treat patients, legal advisers have said. Video calling could reduce the number of missed GP appointments, the Medical and Dental Defence Union of Scotland said in advice to doctors. Patients in rural areas or those with disabilities could use Skype to talk to their GP ‘face-to-face’ without having to leave their own home. The future? Doctors could use Skype to speak to patients in a bid to save the NHS money and reduce the number of missed GP appointments . The advice comes on the day the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has pledged that all patients in England will be able to order prescriptions and book GP appointments online by 2015. They may even be able to access crucial test results remotely. Medical adviser Dr Barry Parker at the MDDUS said this could be taken further by using video conferencing. He said: ‘The concept of holding consultations via Skype is an interesting development, which may have clear advantages in terms of convenience for patients and doctors. ‘Seeing your doctor in a safe and convenient way in the comfort of your own home may appeal to some patients. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt meets matron Lisa de Jonge at Kings College Hospital in London today. He wants all patients to be able to book GP appointments online by 2015 . ‘Skype consultations may potentially be better than telephone advice calls, in that the patient can see who they are talking to, aiding communication, and the doctor can gain an overall impression of the patient’s condition.’ But he added: ‘The medico-legal pitfalls of Skype consultations are not yet fully apparent as it is a recent development, but it is anticipated that some of these will be similar to telephone advice. ‘The key issue for doctors will be to recognise when this mode of consultation is not sufficient to properly assess the patient and address the problem, and to arrange a face-to-face consultation instead.’ Guidance from the General Medical Council says doctors should examine the patient where necessary.","Video calling could reduce the number of missed GP appointment, says union .

The number of cancer drugs being rejected by the health watchdog has risen by 50 per cent in two years, a report has revealed. Campaigners say NICE is saying no to more treatments since the Government introduced its flagship Cancer Drugs Fund, which was meant to supplement the number available. Since 2010, ministers have set aside £200million a year for the fund to pay for cancer drugs which have not been approved by NICE for use on the NHS but which doctors think may help patients. Scroll down for video . Turned down: Drugs rejected by the health watchdog last year include treatments for advanced breast cancer, bowel cancer and prostate cancer . But a leading charity is concerned that since the scheme was set up, the watchdog knows it can afford not to make some drugs available because patients may be able to get them anyway through the fund. A report by the Rarer Cancers Foundation shows that in 2011/12 11 new treatments were rejected by NICE – many because  they were not ‘cost-effective’ – out of 19 put forward. This represents nearly 60 per cent of the total. But in 2009/10 only seven new drugs were turned down out of 15 put forward, just 46 per cent of the total. This is despite the fact that the cost of the new drugs has decreased, which should mean NICE is more inclined to agree they should be paid for by the NHS. Concerned: Andrew Wilson, chief executive of the Rarer Cancers Foundation, said there were widespread variations in the treatments available . On average, the cost of cancer drugs being assessed by NICE was £44,956 per patient last year, down from £51,797 in 2009/10. The drugs turned down last year include treatments for advanced breast cancer, bowel cancer, prostate cancer and leukaemia. But the charity points out that it is far better that cancer drugs are approved by NICE in the first place because there is no guarantee that patients will get them through the Cancer Drugs Fund. Its report reveals a stark postcode lottery with certain areas of  the country far more likely to agree to pay for drugs through the fund  than others. It also shows that hundreds of patients are being turned away from funding even though last  year £89million of the £200million went unspent. Andrew Wilson, chief executive of the . charity, said: ‘It is concerning that there are widespread variations . in the treatments which are routinely available, increasing  anxiety for . patients and resulting  in unnecessary bureaucracy. ‘At a time when the Cancer Drugs Fund . is underspent, it is unacceptable that patients are still being turned . down for the drugs their doctors think could help them.’ The report shows that since the fund began in October 2010 it has paid for the treatments of more than 13,000 patients. But 307 were refused treatment even though their specialist doctors strongly believed it could help extend their life or make it more bearable. A NICE spokesman said: ‘If a drug is clinically and cost-effective then we will recommend it for use on the NHS. ‘But if there isn’t sufficient evidence to show that a drug provides benefits over and above currently available medicines, or if the price the NHS is being asked to pay is too high to justify its benefits, then we cannot recommend it. ‘The independent appraisal committee makes decisions in the same rigorous manner, based on evidence provided, as it did before the introduction of the Cancer Drugs Fund.’ VIDEO: Paul Burstow says the Government values Macmillan's report into cancer care... and hopes hospitals will take note...","NICE is saying no to more treatments than it did before Cancer Drugs Fund was introduced. campaigners say .

Julian Assange’s celebrity backers stood firmly behind their man yesterday despite losing almost £300,000 from his ‘daft’ decision to skip bail. Supporters of the WikiLeaks founder admitted he gave them no warning that he planned to take refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden where he faces rape and sexual assault allegations. He has been holed up in the embassy since June. Visit: Lady Gaga with Assange in his embassy bolthole on Monday . On Monday night he was pictured posing there with Lady Gaga, who visited him hours after nine people who acted as bail sureties were ordered by a court to hand over £93,500. Support: Another group of Assange supporters, including socialite Jemima Khan have also forfeited a security of £200,000 . Another group of Assange supporters, including socialite Jemima Khan, journalist John Pilger, film director Ken Loach and publisher Felix Dennis have also forfeited a security of £200,000. Securities are paid up front to a court whereas sureties are promised funds. Despite the huge cost, the celebrities continue to support Assange and express fears that if he is extradited to Sweden he will be sent on to the US to face interrogation over the whistle-blowing website, which has published secret military files and diplomatic cables. Scotland Yard has said it is costing . £11,000 every day to ensure the Australian does not flee his bolt-hole . at the embassy in Knightsbridge. Mr Dennis said: ‘I think what Julian Assange did was absolutely daft, but that’s got nothing to do with it. ‘Julian Assange was going to be put . into prison ... He committed no crime that we know of. He was not going . to be given bail. He was going to be put into solitary. ‘I’m not having people put into . British jails and put into solitary confinement when they’ve been found . guilty of absolutely nothing, just to please the American government. No . sir, no sir.’ Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Loose Ends, . he added: ‘Of course I’ve lost my money, but so what? It would have . been nice if he’d called and told me, but there we are.’ Assange has been granted political asylum by Ecuador but faces arrest if he leaves the embassy after breaking bail conditions. Vaughan Smith, a friend who is one of . the sureties, said all those who had put up bail had put a ‘huge amount . of effort’ over a long period to support the legal process. He told Westminster magistrates’ court: ‘It is very difficult to see how we could have prevented Mr . Assange from seeking political asylum in London. Mr Assange says he did not tell us of . his decision because to do so would have placed us in legal difficulty. We could not have expected it. Such a thing is unprecedented for a . surety.’ Holed up: The Ecuadorean Embassy in London where WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been staying since June 19 . Involved: Vaughan Smith (left), a friend who is . one of the sureties, addressed a court last week on behalf of the nine. The Marchioness of Worcester (right), the former actress Tracy Ward, was . also a backer . But he said it would be a ‘public betrayal’ if they urged him to abandon the Ecuadorian Embassy when he had ‘understandable’ fears about his treatment in the United States if he gave up his asylum. The Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle said he accepted that the sureties had acted in good faith but ruled that each of them had to pay part of the sum originally pledged. Miss Khan has previously tweeted: ‘I personally would like to see Assange confront the rape allegations in Sweden and the two  women at the centre have a right  to a response. ‘But there is no doubt that Assange has a real fear of being extradited to the US nor that the US gov is out to get WikiLeaks.’","Supporters of the WikiLeaks founder admitted he gave them no warning that he planned to take refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden where he faces rape and sexual assault allegations .

The Royal College of Nursing last night accused NHS bosses of ‘sleepwalking into a crisis’, claiming that more than 60,000 health jobs will disappear as a result of budget cuts. The NHS workforce in England has already fallen by 28,500 posts since May 2010, and another 32,700 jobs are at risk of being cut, the RCN claimed. The number of qualified nurses alone had fallen by more than 6,000 between May 2010 and July this year, the union said. A member of Royal College of Nursing protests against budget cuts on a march in London in October. The RCN say 60,000 staff could go . A report for the organisation’s Frontline First campaign said the cuts come at the worst possible time for the country, with a soaring demand for care because of an ageing population and more patients with long-term conditions. ‘The RCN believes that the NHS is sleepwalking into a nursing crisis in England that is drawing closer as the size of the cuts increase,’ the report says. ‘If the Government continues on its current path it will find itself stranded in a perfect storm of an ageing population with increasing healthcare demands, but without the adequate nursing workforce to deal with it.’ Local NHS trusts are responsible for making decisions about staffing levels, but the RCN said there was a lack of national oversight staff numbers. The organisation is calling on ministers to prevent NHS trusts from ‘continuing with this damaging agenda of cuts’ that ‘impact on patient care’. Cuts to nursing could have an 'impact' on patient care, says the RCN . RCN’s head of policy Howard Catton said: ‘The cumulative effect of those local decisions means that we are heading towards a crisis as far as the supply of nursing is concerned which will have an impact on patient care. ‘There has to be national oversight to make sure that we are getting the right numbers of healthcare professionals across the system. ‘If attention isn’t paid to this warning from us we are very, very concerned about what the impact on care will be.’ Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the RCN, said a reduction in nursing training places meant the supply line of nurses was ‘being choked’.But health minister Dan Poulter accused the RCN of ‘scaremongering’. He said: ‘NHS performance is strong - waiting times and infection rates are at record low levels. ‘To say that the NHS is in crisis is scaremongering and doesn’t reflect reality. ‘This Government fully supports the NHS and will put an extra £12.5 billion into the health services by 2015.’","Number of qualified nurses has fallen by 6,000 since May 2010, says RCN .

A brave schoolboy has had 40 operations as doctors try to cure him of an eight-year headache. Football-mad Laughlan Dougall has suffered pains in his brain since the age of two after diagnosed with a frontal lobe arachnoid cyst - a growth that swells and causes pressure to build up in his skull. Since then he has gone under the knife on average once every two months to drain fluid and even expand his skull, having his last operation just six weeks ago at Glasgow’s Yorkhill Royal Hospital for Sick Children. Laughlan (left) has suffered from head pain since the age of two when he was diagnosed with a brain cyst. He has been treated several times at Glasgow's Yorkhill Royal Hospital (right) Doctors have installed several shunts into his head which connect his brain to his stomach to allow the fluid in the cyst to drain away but the shunts continue to fail and need replacing regularly. Due to the number of operations Laughlan has also developed complex hydrocephalus, also known as ‘water on the brain’. Despite his condition the Celtic fan still loves to play football with his mates, though he isn’t well enough yet to join a team, and attends school three days a week. But Laughlan said his dreams came true when he met the Scotland football squad during one of their training sessions at Cappielow in Greenock, Inverclyde, on Tuesday. Laughlan, of Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, said: 'The have always had the headaches so I don’t really notice them anymore. 'I have had a lot of operation but I don’t mind them really. It is just something that happens. 'It was brilliant training with the team and I got a top signed by the players. I like to play in goal but haven’t been able to join a team because I wasn’t well. 'However, doctors have told me I can play football again, so I’m going to start.' Lauchlan after his most recent operation to relieve the pressure on his brain . Laughlan’s mother Debbie, 36, first noticed something was wrong with his son when he continually fell over as a toddler. She took him to hospital where doctors found he had a cyst in his brain.The cyst constantly fills with fluid causing pressure to build inside Laughlan’s skull, and giving him a constant headache. The schoolboy had an operation to remove bone from his skull to give the brain more room in October last year, but the surgery failed. Laughlan’s most recent operation was to replace his shunt, which became blocked. Proud Debbie has raised her son alone, along with his 17-year-old sister Amber, since his dad Barry died of skin cancer three years ago. Lauchlan is keen to start playing football again after meeting Scotland goalie David Marshall . Debbie said: 'When he was a toddler he would get really bad headaches and hit his head against the wall. We took him to the hospital and that’s when they discovered he had the cyst. 'To this day, though, if he’s got a really bad one he’ll hit his head against walls. 'The shunts don’t seem to work for any length of time, so he needs to keep going back to the hospital. When the shunts fail he will quite often start to twitch, and you’re guaranteed he’ll be in the hospital within the next couple of days. 'He has had 40 operations but each time I have to watch him be put to sleep is painful. 'At the end of the day he is my baby and always will be. We just take each day at a time and hope this shunt won’t fail. 'I don’t know how he lives with a constant headache. I couldn’t do it. He is absolu . tely amazing and the bravest person I know.' Lauchlan is now fronting a campaign for the Child Brain Injury Trust t . o raise money for children suffering from the same condition. Debbie added: 'They wanted to get Lauchlan a weekend away or a new computer but he wanted it to go to charity. 'It’s a very nice gesture and hopefully he will be able to make it along to throw a few bowls himself.'","Schoolboy has to have an operation around once every two months to drain fluid from his skull .

Fishermen have discovered many exhausted and disorientated 'garden' birds plunging into the sea around their vessels, according to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). England's east coast, from Northumberland to Kent, has seen the arrival of many birds, including redwings, fieldfares, bramblings and blackbirds, perhaps numbering in their millions. The charity said these were the lucky survivors which had managed to cross the North Sea, but many others might have perished before making landfall. The skipper of a boat said: 'While fishing about 10 miles south of Portsmouth, we witnessed thousands of garden birds disorientated, land on the sea and most drowning. 'Species included goldcrests, robins, thrushes and blackbirds. The sky was thick with garden birds. I estimate I saw 500 birds die and that was just in our 300-yard sphere.' Martin Harper, the RSPB's conservation director, said: 'The scale of these reports is truly shocking, and it has the potential to adversely affect the status of species which may be declining for other reasons.'","Temperatures as cold as Moscow as chill of winter hits the north-east .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 05:02 EST, 8 October 2012 . A woman who managed to avoid prison after being convicted of soliciting a dog for sex on Craigslist, spent time in jail over the weekend after she was arrested due to a clerical error. Sarah Dae Walker, 33, was arrested on Friday by police in Phoenix who claimed that there was a warrant out for her over unpaid fines from a previous run-in with the law. ‘I said, “I’m current on all my fines, this can’t be right,”’ she said. The police officer didn’t believe her, and she was taken into custody. Sarah Dae Walker was arrested by police in Phoenix who claimed that there was a warrant out for her over unpaid fines from a previous run-in . Husband Shane got 18 months probation on conspiracy to commit beastiality . Walker spent 10 hours behind bars before being told that the whole thing was a mistake and there was no actual warrant for her arrest. Speaking about her previous run-in with the law, Walker told KASW-TV that she and her husband were trying to get back to normal after their conviction for conspiracy to commit beastiality, an incident which she says 'really ruined our lives.' Sarah Dae Walker and her husband Shane of San . Tan Valley, Arizona appeared in court in August to face charges of conspiracy . to commit beastiality after soliciting an undercover deputy for the use of his . golden shepherd in June. The couple, who had an admitted open marriage, were arrested . alongside the wife's lover Robert Aucker, 26, after the trio made plans to meet . with the dog and its owner at a Mesa Quality Inn. Sarah Walker was sentenced to 24 months of supervised . probation with her husband ordered 18 months under the same beastiality . charge. Both are also prohibited from owning or caring for any . animals. Mr Walker, who was a flight attendant at the time of his . arrest, expressed his grief over the incident that he says caused him to lose . his job and has laid a sheet of embarrassment on his family. 'If I could turn back time, I wish I could, I can't so I'm . trying to move forward in my life,' he told the judge according to KPHO. His wife offered her own apology saying the embarrassment . alone has rocked her. 'I think about my children every day. That is why I'm here. That is why I'm alive,' she said. Mr Walker told the judge that his wife checked into a . behavioral institute right after their arrest. The Walkers posted a Craigslist ad on . February 7 titled, 'Wife looking for K9', according to Maricopa County . Superior Court records. During a number of email exchanges . between the couple and the detective, Dae offered sexual favors and they . agreed to meet at the Quality Inn in Mesa, which is where they were . arrested. Apology: Mrs Walker apologized in court for her behaviour and said the embarrassment alone has rocked not only her but her children as well . Court records state that Dae, a . photographer, admitted to detectives she told both her husband and . Aucker she wanted a dog to have sex with her. The trio had been hoping to meet the owner of a Golden Shepherd having spent three weeks corresponding with her over the use of the dog. Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said: 'People who do this for enjoyment are a different breed, that's for certain.' Arpaio, who is known as the toughest sheriff in America over his stand against illegal immigration, said the Walkers had described themselves as 'swingers'. Caught: The wife's lover Robert Aucker, 26, (pictured) was arrested alongside the couple who expected to find the dog advertised, right, in the hotel room . According to the arrest report Aucker said he had been involved with Dae for a month and she had expressed her desire to have sex with a dog. Last year Sheriff Arpaio wrote to Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster after the arrest of two people for using the website to solicit dogs for sex. Arpaio asked for closer monitoring of the site, but said after the latest arrest: 'I remain extremely disappointed in the leadership at Craigslist.com for refusing to do what they can to stop this. 'While they aren't doing anything to stop it, I will continue to enforce all animal cruelty laws.'

One man's attempt to paddle his 'human hamster wheel' 66 miles across the Irish Sea came to a sudden end last night - with the giant wheel sinking to the bottom of the ocean. Chris Todd was aiming to raise thousand of pounds charity by hamster-wheeling his way across the sea - but at around 10.30pm last night, the 35-year-old had to call time on his home-made contraption after the winds picked up and his rudders gave way. The attempt, on behalf of the the Wiltshire Blind Association and the RNLI, had to come to an end nine hours and 15 miles in to the proposed mission. Luckily a support team was there to pick up Chris - but sadly the hamster wheel ended up on the sea-bed, where it will lie undisturbed and waiting to perplex future historians. Scroll down to watch how it (almost) worked . Failed attempt: Chris Todd sets out on his 66 mile self-powered voyage across the Irish Sea on a craft that looks more hamster wheel than boat . The engineer, from Bromham, Wiltshire, set out on a calm sea from Trearddur Bay, North Wales, at 1.45pm yesterday heading for Greystones harbour in Ireland . Todd, from Bromham, Wiltshire, . set out on a calm sea from Trearddur Bay, North Wales, at 1.45pm on . Sunday, heading for Greystones harbour, County Wicklow, Ireland. But just after 1am this morning, the Tredalo, as the vehicle was known, was hit by moderate winds of between 13-18mph. Annie Davis, of Wiltshire Blind Association, one of the charities he's raising funds for, said today: 'It's a great shame he had to give up as the sea was like a millpond and who knows when he will have another window in the weather. 'But the upside is that he got much further in those nine hours than he anticipated, so he is determined to try again later this month.' HM Lifeguard watch officer Richard . Jones said: 'I think they got to about 12-15 miles outside of South . Stack Lighthouse. They experienced problems and tried to turn around but . it disintegrated. 'The whole thing has sunk to the bottom of the sea. It won’t be a danger to navigation or shipping. 'Everyone was recovered. They waited around until it sank and then returned to Holyhead Marina.' Todd, 35, had been waiting for . optimum conditions before attempting the stunt and launched his craft . beneath bright clear skies before a crowd of well-wishers. If all had gone to plan he would have arrived in Greystones harbour today at midday. As he set off, he said: 'It is going . to be one of the toughest things I’ve ever done. Imagine spending . 48-hours on a stepping machine in the gym without getting any sleep. 'Some people say I am mad but I’m hoping my madness will inspire generosity for two charities close to my heart.'

He was planning to consume 30 litres . of water and eat the equivalent of 60 Mars bars to keep energy levels up . and stay awake for 48 hours. He added: 'I’m trying to figure out . how I’m so anxious about heading off into a calm sea when the RNLI . launch into much worse stuff all the time . 'It will be like running 10 back-to-back marathons. This crossing is on the very edge of what I believe is possible - but I am looking forward to a cold Guinness on arrival.' Chris hand-built the human hamster wheel in his garden with help from his wife and friends. The idea came to him while rowing across a lake - and he spent 11 months painstakingly piecing it together. He originally planned to use it to . cross the English Channel, but red-tape and high costs curtailed his . bid, forcing him to turn to the Irish Sea.

Chris said: 'Just recounting how much help I’ve had to get here makes me feel very lucky. 'The sea is looking calm in the bay . but the real critical point will be experiencing strong winds - if the . sea is rough then it could put an end to it. 'I can cope with seven to ten knots but winds of 15 and 16 knots have been forecast. 'The only way we are going know if it will stand up to the battering from the waves is to actually do it.' Among those gathered to wave Chris off was his wife Joy.

Courage: Jennifer Bennett, who was raped and beaten by a man she met on Match.com, refused to hand over a list of her Google searches to the defense, saying 'I am not on trial' The decision is one that could have landed Ms Bennett in jail for contempt of court. She told the Today show that she was shocked to have been asked for the personal material. She said: 'I was not the criminal. investigating me and my life, it didn't seem right, it didn't seem just.' Ms Bennett decided to go public following the attack in hopes of encouraging other sexual assault victims to report their attacks and not feel 're-victimized' by the system. Though she expected to be questioned by police and interrogated by Bray's prominent attorney, she did not expect that they would try to use her own Google searches against her in an attempt to diminish the seriousness of the attack. Ms Bennett added: 'You make internet searches all the time but you never think that anyone is going to be looking in and using that as a reason as a defense over something horrific that happened to you.' Bray's lawyers ordered Ms Bennett to turn over her Google searches . because they wanted to show that around the time of the February 2011 . attack, Ms Bennett searched for the definition of rape. Defense . attorneys believed that this would help support Bray's story that their . sexual was rough but consensual, and Ms Bennett regretted it after the . fact so she was looking for a way to argue her way out of it.

Instead of penalizing the victim, the . jury sentenced Bray to spend the next 25 years in jail as he was found . guilty of rape, sodomy, strangulation and assault. Case didn't work: Bray's lawyer tried to have the victim's Google searches submitted as evidence in order to suggest she did not really know what rape was .

Celebrating the 50th anniversary of his licence to thrill, 007 is back with a resounding bang. The film has been greeted with universal acclaim by critics from Baz Bamigboye and Matthew Bond (no relation) on the Daily Mail and Mail On Sunday respectively, to The Times, the Daily Telegraph and respected Hollywood Reporter. Licensed to kill: Javier Bardem watches Daniel Craig as James Bond in the new movie Skyfall . Thrilling action: Bond fights one of adversaries in an action sequence on top of a train . Skyfall opens in the UK on October 26 and in the U.S. on November 9. It is directed by Britain's Sam Mendes who  won a best director Oscar in 2000 for American Beauty. The Bond films have amassed $5.1 billion at the worldwide box office since Dr No with 007 Sean Connery hit our screens in 1962, according to The-Numbers.com, which tracks performances. After the disappointment of Quantum Of Solace in 2008, compared with Daniel Craig’s first outing as Bond in the superb Casino Royale, Skyfall has the lot. There's the frighteningly creepy villain in Javier Bardem to great acting from Craig and the better-than-ever action sequences. And if that wasn't enough, multi-award winning Adele performs the chart-hit film song. Judi Dench returns in the role of M . along with co-stars Ralph Fiennes and Ben Whishaw, while Naomie Harris . and Berenice Marlohe became the latest Bond girls. Poster boy: The image of Daniel Craig's cool Bond promoting the latest movie in the franchise . Bond and another beauty: A bedroom scene from Skyfall with Craig and actress Tonia Sotiropoulou . It opens with a bravura kick-ass . pre-credits sequence that could win a best short all-action Oscar all by . its beautiful self if such an award existed, says Bamigboye. Villain: Javier Bardem in Skyfall . He gave the film five stars and quoted . Bond historian Graham Rye as saying the film is ‘up there in the top . five of all the 23 films made in the world's most famous film . franchise.’ Bamigboye lauds the film. 'I plan to see Skyfall a few more times before the year's out. Nothing can beat a landmark, classic James Bond picture. They don't come around all that often.' The Mail On Sunday's Matthew Bond says Bond devotees are 'in for a treat'. Of Craig's performance he wrote: . 'It's a million miles from Roger Moore's 007 or Pierce Brosnan's come to that, with Craig delivering the sort of reputation-enhancing performance that shows casino Royale was not a one-off.' Times critic Kate Muir wrote: . 'Skyfall is a great British bulldog of a movie. From the moment the . orchestral sound of Adele belts out, sending a nostalgic shiver down the . audience’s collective spine, we know this will be a triumphant return . to classic Bond.’ Hollywood Reporter critic Todd McCarthy gushed: . 'Gripping . while still brandishing a droll undercurrent of humor, this beautifully . made film will certainly be embraced as one of the best Bonds by loyal . fans worldwide and leaves you wanting the next one to turn up sooner . than four years from now. 'Ultimately, . there is a very conscious, even articulated effort to balance the old . and new, the traditional and the modern in Skyfall — stylistically, . dramatically and thematically.' SugarScape says : . 'This is actually one of the more emotional Bond films that we’ve seen – there’s no master plan to destroy the world or a laser beam threatening to blow up the moon, but the plot focuses on revenge and personal vendettas – which makes for a fair few tear-jerking moments.' Cool: Dressed in his trademark black tuxedo, Bond flirts with actress Berenice Marlohe . The Guardian gave the movie just three stars, but says: . 'Craig, as ever, makes for a splendidly authoritative Bond, even when he’s suffering a crisis of faith and scowling at his reflection inside dirty mirrors. 'Audaciously, Skyfall’s most sexually charged moment comes  as Silva [Barden] runs his fingers across Bond’s bare chest, then reaches down to part his legs. 'What’s your regulation training for this?' Silva teases him. 'What makes you think it’s my first time?” 007 shoots back  - a tacit reminder that he went to Eton after all.' Skyfall, the third Bond film starring Craig in the role of the martini-swilling, womanizing secret agent, gets a thumbs up from Variety's Peter Debruge. He wrote: . 'It's taken 23 films and 50 years to get Bond's backstory, but the wait was worth it.' Reviewer Robbie Collin of the Telegraph said director Sam Mendes' Bond was comparable to Christopher Nolan's darker, grittier Batman from the Dark Knight franchise. Returning: Judi Dench is back as M while Ben Whishaw makes his debut as gadget king Q . Sailing to success: Daniel Craig and Bernice Marlohe in a scene from Skyfall . ‘Mendes is unafraid to let the quieter dramatic moments breathe ... and ace cinematographer Roger Deakins makes the wildly ambitious action sequences the most beautiful in Bond's 50-year career.' British GQ magazine tweeted: ‘Just seen #skyfall. Daniel Craig is magnificent - you will not be disappointed.’ Graham Rye of Double-O-Seven magazine said the film was so good because producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli had assembled what he called a 'dream team' from director to cinematographer. He said: 'I think that sometimes directors are hired who don't understand Bond. 'Well, in Sam Mendes you have a man who understands what makes Bond tick and Wilson and Broccoli have got a fantastic team to work with him from actors who are at the top of their game.'","Daily Mail's Baz Bamigboye gives Skyfall a five-star rating .

If confirmed, it is the first major redesign of the distinctive white headphones since the iPhone launched, other than the addition of an in-line microphone and remote control in 2008. The headphones, which come bundled with iPods and iPhones, are one of the most iconic parts of Apple's product line-up, and are perhaps most famous for appearing in the famous 'dancing silhouettes' adverts for the iPod. Are these the next iPhone headphones? Vietnamese site Tinhte.vn said Apple's distinctive 'buds are being produced at the Vietnamese Foxconn factory . Old versus new: The newer model (on the left) have a smaller, one-piece design . Tinhte.vn has sources from within Apple suppliers' Vietnamese-based factories, such as the parts-based Foxconn company. Mac Rumours translated the video commentary, which states: 'In . my hands are the new earphones for the iPhone 5 that is about to come . out. 'These will replace the current earphones that are on the market. 'They have the appearance of a horse's . head, not like earbuds. When they are worn, . they have a much smaller profile. They have the appearance of a fully . integrated, single unit - there's no part that looks like it would come . apart - not like earbuds; the integrated design is characteristic of . Apple products. 'All factors such as design, quality . finishing materials fabricated wire, plastic body headphones are led to . the conclusion this is genuine and not counterfeit headphones.' Could this be your next wallet? Analysts say the ribbons spotted at the top of this iPhone prototype point to an 'NFC' chip inside . The iPhone is also expected to come with a built-in chip which can serve as your credit or debit card for small payments. Eagle-eyed fans looking at leaked images of the internals of the device have spotted what they believe is an NFC chip within the phone. NFC is seen as the successor to the chip-and-pin, serving as a small contactless card which can be waved against scanners at tills to automate a payment. Some debit cards already have this feature installed, and certain retailers such as Pret a Manger already use the technology. Other . phones have come with in-built NFC, with Google making a big play for . the market with its 'Wallet' accounts in the United States. But . recent history shows that Apple needs to embrace a technology before it . sees widespread adoption among the public, and it could take an . 'iWallet' feature to spark a new payment system into life. 9to5Mac, . which has credible sources within the notoriously-secret Apple, has . found references to NFC code within iPhone prototypes, and they have . spotted 'NFC connectors' within purported images of the phone's . hardware. 9to5 speculates that 'Apple could tie . in with a payment processor like Citibank’s PayPass system for credit . card transactions - or it could become a payment processor of sorts with . its hundreds of millions of credit cards already on file at iTunes.' NFC has other useful benefits to users, . such as instantly transferring documents or images between phones simply . by tapping them together, as demonstrated by rival Samsung's 'Beam' feature on the recent Galaxy 3.

David Lynch was spared jail after hitting a cyclist while he was speeding, causing 'catastrophic' injuries . A police officer who caused 'catastrophic life-changing' injuries to a cyclist while responding to an emergency call in his van has been spared jail. David Lynch, 31, was found guilty of dangerous driving earlier this year for hitting Joseph Belmonte after driving over a humpback bridge in Hackney, east London at 68mph in a 30mph zone. Horrified eye witnesses described . hearing a ‘loud bang’ before the musician was propelled onto the bonnet . then thrown towards a tree like a ‘rag doll’. Mr Belmonte, who was just a week away . from releasing his debut album, spent nine days in an induced coma . after suffering brain, spinal, and facial injuries, as well as a broken . right arm and finger. Lynch, . a former British Transport Police officer, who had since resigned from . his job, was today given an eight-month suspended jail sentence at . Southwark Crown Court. Judge Jeffrey Pegden QC, sentencing . Lynch to eight months in prison suspended for 12 months, said: 'What has . weighed significantly with me is your intense guilt, remorse and utter . distress at the injuries you caused that day, coupled with your . immediate and appropriate response not only at the scene but in your . determined efforts afterwards, until you were told it was inappropriate, . to seek information about the welfare of Mr Belmonte.' Lynch, from Hitchin in Hertfordshire, was also ordered to carry out 240 hours . of community service and told he must be electronically tagged and . subject to a 7pm to 6am curfew for 12 weeks. He was also banned from . driving for 15 months and ordered to pay £1,000 towards prosecution . costs. The court heard how Lynch and front seat passenger PC Gary Thomas, had been racing to assist a colleague at Hackney Downs station on March 31 last year. Lynch had come on to the rise of the unmarked bridge in Queensbridge Road at 68mph while in a 30mph zone. He had reduced his speed to 63mph . before his vehicle 'took off' and became 'airborne' - landing so hard . that it made gouges in the road. The police officer 'lost control' of the van, which swerved to the left, hitting the kerb, and then to the right, hitting Mr Belmonte from behind at a speed of 45mph. The judge described the speed at which he drove over the bridge as ‘very dangerous’. he said: ‘You lost control of the vehicle, . first steering to the left and clipping the curb and then to the right . and hitting Mr Belmonte from behind at a speed of 45mph.' The court heard that Mr Belmonte, 31, who was not wearing a helmet, was in a medically induced coma for nine days after the collision and suffered spine, knee, brain and facial injuries. Southwark Crown Court where the British Transport police officer was given a suspended sentence . He had a broken right elbow and little finger which resulted in him having to learn to play the guitar again. He also suffered severe psychological effects and his head and associated brain injury mean he is likely to be left with permanent cognitive impairment. Lynch had already pleaded guilty to careless driving but denied one charge of dangerous driving. Judge Pegden said Mr Belmonte had suffered 'catastrophic life- changing' injuries and his career as a musician had been 'ruined'. 'He still suffers major disabilities and faces further significant surgery and treatment,' he said. The court heard that the married father-of-two had two previous speeding convictions. In 2005, before he joined British Transport Police, he was banned from driving for two months and fined £250 for driving at 98mph on a motorway. In 2008, he was handed a fixed penalty notice for driving at 40mph in a 30mph zone. Lynch, from Hitchin in Hertfordshire, was also ordered to carry out 240 hours of community service and told he must be electronically tagged and subject to a 7pm to 6am curfew for 12 weeks . Judge Pegden said he was persuaded to suspend the . sentence by what he described as Lynch’s ‘intense guilt, remorse, and . utter distress’ at the injuries he caused Mr Belmonte and a ‘raft of . fine character references’. He said: ‘In my view you have shown . these general characteristics over the last 18 months and no doubt will . bear them for the rest of your life.’ The court was told he had driven 500 response calls in an 18-month period since qualifying as a response driver. Lynch had told jurors he had had no time . to react to the cyclist after his vehicle left the ground as he came . over the brow of the hill. He said: ‘As I tried to gain control of it in that split second I saw the cyclist on my left hand side. ‘In the course of my correction I hit the cyclist from behind causing him to come off and on to the near side of my bonnet. ‘I was braking the whole time so after the impact he was thrown forward as my vehicle decelerated. ‘The cyclist was thrown forward and came to a stop by a tree. ‘It felt like the blink of an eye. It happened that quickly from impact to stepping out of the vehicle.’ Defence counsel Ben Summers had said it was important to balance Lynch’s ‘momentary lapse’ against the ‘much longer lasting, perhaps permanent consequences for Mr Belmonte’ He said: ‘It is difficult [to pass sentence] in the particular circumstances of this case because this is a case in which there was no decision, for reasons of bravado, thrill-seeking or aggression, to drive in a way that was at least potentially dangerous, this was an officer responding in the course of his duty to an emergency call.’ Reading from Lynch’s letter of resignation he said: ‘Given the media coverage of my case I would not wish to cause the BTP any further embarrassment, but, more than that, I feel I can no longer carry out the roles and responsibilities associated with my position. ‘I feel morally obliged to give up the role which I’ve cherished for the last five years.’ Earlier this year singer-songwriter Mr . Belmonte, also known as Pepe, said: I miss my life as it was before the accident. I was young . and living the life of a working musician cycling round London looking . for venues to play and musicians to play with.' Speaking after the officer’s trial in August, the musician’s mother Patsy Belmonte, from Weybridge, Surrey, said: ‘Pepe was just a week away from launching his first album when he was hit. ‘He has since spent 15 months recovering. It has had a huge impact on every area of his life, including his career and his independence. ‘Physically, he will never be the same.’","David Lynch, 31, was responding to an emergency call in his van .

A man who shot himself in the head while playing ‘Russian Roulette’ is fighting for his life. Donnie McLendon, 26, is in a critical condition with a single gunshot wound after he was rushed to Florida hospital by others taking part in the deadly game, according to St Petersburg police. McLendon was the third person to place a loaded weapon against his head and pull the trigger. Hospitalized: Police say 26-year-old Donnie McLendon, pictured from a 2011 arrest, allegedly shot himself during a game of Russian Roulette . Changing stories: Witnesses first told police that McLendon, pictured, was the victim of a home invasion but later admitted to playing the deadly game Russian Roulette . Two other men taking part in the game, had fired the gun and survived. The others taking part in the game had initially claimed that McLendon had been shot during a violent home invasion. They claimed the ‘home invader’ shot McLendon in the head and then fled with the suspect dropping his gun. But as detectives began making inquiries the men, named as Daniel McKee, 22, and Thomas Rady, 29, changed their story. They said after drinking and smoking marijuana they began playing Russian Roulette. Police recovered a .44 calibre handgun as well as a single bullet casing. Police . said Mckee, Rady and Mckee's girlfriend, who was sleeping in another . room at the home when the shooting took place, picked up McLendon and . carried him to Mckee's car and drove him to the hospital. Mckee told investigators he was house-sitting at the residence for a friend, police said. Mistake: McLendon was the third player to hold a 44-caliber handgun to his head loaded with one bullet, as the game's rules go taking a chance that the shot fired would not be the one filled (file photo) ‘At . this point, everything they told us of what happened (involving Russian . roulette) seems plausible,’ said police spokesman MIke Puetz . After he was treated at St. Anthony's, McLendon was transported to Tampa General Hospital where he remains in a critical condition. No charges have been filed, but the investigation is ongoing, police said. As a perhaps surprisingly popular game, captured in the film Deer Hunter starring Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken, McLendon is the Florida Bay Area's second victim in recent months. In June a 17-year-old lost his life while playing the game with three other teenagers at his home in Largo. On the West coast in California, a 35-year-old man lost his life in early September after shooting himself in the head at an apartment in San Bernardino while playing the game with three others. The game has also been accused as a method of torture after four men allegedly held a Winter Garden, Florida family hostage while playing Russian roulette with their five-year-old son in February.","Donnie McLendon, 26, fired the third shot from a .44 calibre handgun while playing the game with friends in St Petersburg, Florida .

Names put forward included former . French president Nicolas Sarkozy and the former Spanish prime minister . Jose Marma Aznar, as well as numerous showbusiness and sports stars. Now the Paris magazine Le Point says . that Ms Dati tried to injunct Mr Desseigne about going public about their . affair, and the fact that he is Zohra's father. Asked to comment today, Mr Desseigne said: 'I have no comment to make, otherwise it will be held against me by the court.' However, he confirmed the legal action taken against him by Ms Dati for 'recognising the paternity of the child.'

In early January, Ms Dati told Elle magazine that 'Yes, I have a man in my life,' but continued to refuse to name him. She said she 'did not want to annoy him', and 'to keep a part of his life private'. Ms Dati, who is a Muslim with North .

Today she refused to say Le Point’s claims were ‘false’. Mr Desseigne, who is worth more than £500 million, was a close ally of the conservative Mr Sarkozy.

When Apple Inc. unveiled the iPhone 5 in September, Samsung launched an advertising campaign poking fun at the new iPhone. Samsung's Galaxy S3 smartphone which has now sold over 30m million units. The South Korean firm said the S III . is selling at a much faster rate than its predecessor announced a year . ago, the Galaxy S II. The S II took 14 months to hit 30 million sales. Sales . of the Galaxy Note II, which fills a market niche between smartphones . and tablets, surpassed 3 million in 37 days, Samsung said last week. Apple . has not released comparable sales figures for its iPhone 5, but said it . sold more than five million of its new iPhones in three days when it . launched. The runaway . demand for high-end smartphones fueled record profits at Samsung in . recent quarters while other consumer electronics firms were hit by the . global economic downturn that dented demand for TVs and personal . computers. Samsung, which . also makes TVs, home appliances, semiconductors and display panels, got . almost 70 percent of its third-quarter operating profit from the . division that makes mobile devices, cameras and computers. Nomura Financial Investment in Seoul forecasts that Samsung will sell 67 million smartphones in the October-December quarter. The S3 has recently been updated to the latest version of Android . That would be about 10 million units more than Samsung's smartphone sales in the previous quarter. Samsung . does not disclose its quarterly smartphone sales figures, but analysts . and research firms say the company sold a record 56-58 million . smartphones in July-September. Nomura, . which is more optimistic about Samsung's prospects than other . forecasters, says Samsung's mobile communications business will post 5 . percent growth in fourth quarter profit from the third quarter, thanks . to the high-end phones - the S III and the Note II.","Samsung sold 18 million S3 models in the third quarter, compared with iPhone 4S sales of 16.2 million .

A father who died in the UK’s first case of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever has been described as a 'hard working and family orientated' man, as it is revealed his relatives may have contracted the same deadly disease. The 38-year-old garage-owner from Glasgow died in hospital on Saturday - two days after laboratory tests confirmed he had the virus, which he is believed to have contracted during a trip to his native Afghanistan to attend his brother's wedding. The man, who hasn't been identified because his next of kin are still being informed, returned to the UK from Afghanistan on Tuesday, via a connecting flight from Dubai, and was rushed to hospital three hours later. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tragic: A man diagnosed with a tropical disease after returning to the UK from Afghanistan has died at the Royal Free Hospital, pictured . His friend Mohammed Asif said the victim came to Britain as an asylum seeker several years ago. He said he lived with his wife and young son, aged around five or six, in Glasgow, where he owned a garage in the east end. 'We are all quite shocked,' he said. 'He was a very nice guy, very family orientated. He was hard working - he worked very hard to provide for his family. 'He was an active member of the Afghan . community here in Scotland. About three weeks ago he helped me paint my . living room, and now every time I look at it I just think of him.' Friend: Mohammad Asif, pictured, said the Scottish Afghan community was shocked and saddened by his friend's sudden death . Mr Asif said he spoke to his friend while he was in the hospital and he told him he was convinced the illness would take his life. 'I spoke to him on the phone... as we weren’t allowed in to see him, and he told me he thought he was going to die,' Mr Asif said. 'He was very dejected. It must be a terrible disease, there’s such a high mortality rate.' There are now grave concerns about . three of the man's family members in the village of Aibak, Afghanistan, . where he visited, as they are displaying symptoms of the fever. Mr . Asif, acting chairman of the Scottish Afghan Society, of which the man . was a member, said: 'I spoke with friends over there... one of his . brothers is having the same problems he did - vomiting, body aches and . pains in his ear. 'Two women from the family also have . some symptoms. We have tried to give them advice, telling them that . anyone showing symptoms should stay away from the rest of the family. He . added that the group had contacted a local politician and sent over . British news reports to be translated, to let the community know how . dangerous the disease is. Mr . Asif said his friend stayed the night in a guesthouse in Kabul on his . way back from the village, which is in the Samangan Province, around 150 . miles north of the capital. 'There, they have burned the carpets, mattresses, cups and cutlery that he might have used,' he told Sky News. The man was picked up from Glasgow Airport on Tuesday by a friend, and within three hours was admitted to hospital. He was initially treated in isolation . at Gartnavel General Hospital’s Brownlee Centre, which specialises in . infectious disease, before being  transferred by the RAF on a C-130 Hercules aircraft from Scotland to a high-security infectious disease unit at London’s Royal Free Hospital. According to his friend, the man . missed his original connecting flight from Dubai and stayed the night in . a hotel, within the airport. Potentially deadly: The man suffered from CCHF, a disease transmitted by ticks (pictured) which is especially common in East and West Africa . 'The . police there stopped him because they thought he might have taken drugs . but they soon realised that he was just very sick,' Mr Asif told the TV . station. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said it . had contacted four passengers who were sitting close to the man on the . Emirates flight from Dubai to Glasgow and two will be monitored on a . daily basis for the next two weeks in case they develop any related . symptoms. CCHF is a widespread tick-borne viral disease which is especially common in Eastern Europe and East and West Africa. There have been cases in the . Mediterranean, in northwestern China, central Asia, southern Europe, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. However, this is the first confirmed case of CCHF in the UK. The disease is fatal in up to 30 per cent of human cases. The onset is said to be sudden, with initial symptoms including headache, high fever, vomiting and back, joint and stomach pain. As the illness progresses, large . areas of severe bruising, severe nosebleeds and uncontrolled bleeding at . injection sites can be seen. CCHF is not airborne and can only be caught through direct contact with the blood or bodily fluids of an infected patient. The people at the greatest risk are animal herders, livestock workers, and those in slaughter houses in endemic areas. Healthcare . workers in endemic areas are also exposed to the risk of infection . through unprotected contact with infectious blood and body fluids. The other two passengers do not require follow-up surveillance the NHS added, and the risk to all other passengers on the flight and the general public is 'extremely low'. 'Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever can be acquired from an infected . patient only through direct contact with their blood or body fluids, . therefore there is no risk to the general public,' the Royal Free London . NHS Foundation Trust said. However, on Thursday, members of 30 Squadron at RAF Brize . Norton were asked to assist . the NHS with the transfer of the patient from Glasgow to London using a C-130 Hercules aircraft. The . aircraft was used because of its specialist isolation unit on-board. It . was sent to Glasgow from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire complete with a . full RAF clinical care team. The . man was picked up at Glasgow Airport and then flown to the . high-security infectious diseases unit at London's Royal Free Hospital, via RAF Northolt. The hospital houses the national specialist centre for the management of patients with hazardous infections. It is the first laboratory-confirmed case of CCHF in the UK, according to the Health Protection Agency (HPA). The man was diagnosed when he returned to Glasgow on Tuesday. He was initially being treated in isolation at . Gartnavel General Hospital's Brownlee Centre, which specialises in . infectious disease. Dr . Syed Ahmed, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Consultant in Public Health . who is coordinating the investigations into this case, said: 'The risk . of person to person transmission of Crimean Congo Viral Haemorrhagic . Fever is extremely low as it can only be transmitted by direct contact . with infected blood or body fluids. 'It is not a virus which is . transmitted through the air. As such the risk to those who were in close . contact with him is minimal. We have already made contact with all the . patient's close contacts and they are being followed-up appropriately. Military assistance: The man was transferred by the RAF on a C-130 Hercules aircraft from the Brownlee Unit in Glasgow to the specialist high security unit at the Royal Free London on Thursday . Emergency: The aircraft was used because of its specialist isolation unit on-board. It was sent to Glasgow from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire complete with a full RAF clinical care team . 'The decision to transfer the . patient to the high security unit at the Royal Free was taken in line . with the national protocol for the management of cases such as this.' NHS Greater Glasgow . and Clyde said while the risk to other passengers on the flight was . extremely low, if any had any concerns they should contact NHS24 on 08000 858531 for advice, further information and reassurance. 'Given . the fact that this man went into the care of the NHS within three hours . of his flight arrival in Glasgow and travelled directly home via . private transport from the airport, we are confident that his close contacts subsequently within the city were minimal,' the board said in a statement. 'We have also identified all NHS . staff, airport and airline staff who have had contact with the patient . and any necessary follow-up action will be taken.' Outbreaks . of the illness are usually attributable to contact with blood or body . fluids from infected animals or people, the health board said. Initial signs include headache, high fever, back pain, joint pain, stomach pain, and vomiting. Red eyes, a flushed face, a red throat, and red spots on the roof of the mouth are also common. Symptoms may also include jaundice, and in severe cases, changes in mood and sensory perception. High security: The high security unit where the man was treated for the potentially fatal disease but later died . As the illness progresses, large areas of severe bruising, nosebleeds and uncontrolled bleeding at injection sites can be seen, beginning on about the fourth day of illness and lasting for about two weeks. Dr Syed Ahmed added: 'The risk of person-to-person transmission of Crimean-Congo viral haemorrhagic fever is extremely low as it can only be transmitted by direct contact with infected blood or body fluids.' 'It is not a virus which is transmitted through the air. As such the risk to those who were in close contact with him is minimal. 'Crimean-Congo viral haemorrhagic fever is a widespread tick-borne viral disease. 'It is not common in Western Europe but is endemic in parts of Eastern and Southern Europe, central Asia, Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent.

A new reality show from the creators of Teen Mom, 16 & Pregnant, and Jersey Shore is set to expose the agonising 30-day wait faced by adoptive parents in which the birth mother can legally take their child back. A summary of the 'The Baby Wait' series posted on the Logo . TV website reads: 'What if you knew your newest addition could suddenly . be subtracted? Your bundle of joy no longer yours.' However producers insist that they are not trying to 'scare' childless parents and the show is aimed at educating viewers on the ins and outs of the adoption process. Paul Siebold and Mark Krieger face an agonising wait after adopting baby Morgan . Brent Zacky, senior vice . president of programming for Logo, told the New York Post: 'I don’t think we’re going to scare . people out of the [adoption] process. 'The desire to have a child and create . a family is deeply rooted in many people. 'And I think if you have that . desire, you’re going to pursue it, knowing that there’s some uncertainty . in the process.' And participants of the show also believe it successfully demonstrates how adoption can be a difficult process for all parties. Paul Siebold who appears in one episode with his domestic partner, Mark Krieger, said: 'I think we are showing what true . life is.' Genavieve Diggs, 18, said she often thought about taking her daughter back during the 30-day period . As the couple are tracked during the 30-day window their anxiety builds as they realise their new daughter could be taken away at any moment as her birth mother, 18-year-old Genavieve Diggs, has the right to back out of the arrangement at any time. Siebold adds: 'When Morgan was put . in our arms, all these hopes and dreams started bubbling up for us. 'But while you [still] have those 30 days, it’s always in . the back of your mind: ‘What if Gen calls?’' Meanwhile Genavieve revealed that she often thought about taking her daughter back and raising her on welfare and food stamps. 'There would be times I would be in . my room by myself looking at pictures or watching videos and I would . start crying thinking, ‘Why do I hurt so much? I miss her. I need her . back in my life. Paul Siebold and Mark Krieger were anxious that baby Morgan could be taken away at any moment during the 30-day window . 'But at the same time, another little voice snapped in the back of my head and said, ‘You can’t take care of a baby.’ And in the end she officially decides to give up her baby for adoption so that she can concentrate on her school work and family life. More adoptions occur in California each year than any other state followed closely by New York. In many states including New York birth mothers have 30 days in which they can legally change their minds and take their babies back. Executive producer Tony DiSanto said: 'This show is really about family ultimately and that's something everybody can relate to.' The series debuts Tuesday, October 30 at 10 p.m. EST on Logo.","Producers insist they are not trying to 'scare' childless couples .

"By . Mark Prigg and Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 06:50 EST, 10 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:30 EST, 10 October 2012 . Apple's yet-to-be-announced iPad Mini has apparently been revealed in full for the first time in the best set of pictures yet leaked on the internet. Sonny Dickson, a researcher for fansite 9to5mac.com, published the images on his Twitter feed yesterday, sparking a wave of excitement among Apple enthusiasts. The images show a device that is significantly smaller than the regular iPad. According to rumours it boasts a 7.85in liquid crystal display, making it a rival to Google's Nexus 7 and Amazon's Kindle Fire. Is this the finished iPad Mini? This picture, published to Twitter, appears to show the completed version of Apple's hotly anticipated new device . The mini is thought to be 7in diagonally, compared to the 9.7in of the full-size iPad. This would allow it to be used easily on public transport, and fit into a (large) jacket pocket. TrustedReviews is predicting the mini - which some are dubbing the iPad nano - will use a 1,024 x 768 pixel panel. The images also show the iPad Mini utilises the controversial new connector introduced with the iPhone 5, which has made all accessories available to previous Apple gadgets obsolete at a stroke. It emerged yesterday that Apple had instructed suppliers in China to manufacture 10million of the new smaller tablet computers, showing faith in their product in the face of stiff competition. Insiders say the iPad Mini will be announced on October 17, a few days from the releases of Amazon's Kindle Fire and Microsoft's Surface tablets, and go on sale November 2. As yet, however, Apple has not officially confirmed any of the reports, rumours of leaks about a smaller iPad. Apple's 9-inch device dominates the . market, but smaller, cheaper tablets have been eating away at the iPad's . popularity. The iPad mini is expected to so on sale around the world on . November 2nd, according to online speculation. Changes: This picture, leaked by the same source, compares the new connector on the iPad Mini with the old version as seen on previous versions of the iPad . The launch date was reported by Fortune magazine, which cites Apple investors hearing the date from 'multiple sources'. The . device is believed to have similar hardware to last year's iPad 2, but . reduced to a pocket-friendly seven or eight-inch form. Samsung plans to unveil a smaller version of its popular Galaxy S III smartphone, pictured right, in Europe tomorrow. It will be very similar to the original, but will feature a 4in screen, placing it in in direct competition with the iPhone 5, which also has a 4in screen. Samsung's original Galaxy S III, unveiled in late May, has a 4.8-inch screen. Strong sales of the flagship phone helped Samsung post record $7.3billion operating profit between July and September. 'We think there's strong demand for 4-inch screen models in Europe,' JK Shin, head of its mobile business, as said today. There had been market speculation that Samsung would launch a stripped out, cheaper version of the Galaxy S III to win market share in the mid- to low-end smartphone segment. However, Samsung said the Galaxy S III Mini would not be an entry-level model. Fortune reports that Apple will send . out invites for the launch on October 10, gathering tech journalists and . stakeholders together to unveil the device. Amazon, . meanwhile has already enjoyed huge success in the US with its updated . Fire tablets - but will release them internationally for the first time . on the 25th October. The gadgets, are available in both . 7-inch and 8.9-inch versions (although only the 7-inch version is . currently set to go o sale outside of the US). The third contender is Microsoft, with its Surface tablets. The . firm will launch the Surface tablet at the same time as Windows 8, the . latest version of its desktop operating system, which experts say is a . 'make or break' time for the firm. 'It's a dangerous game, as all three firms are trying to steal each other's thunder,' said Tom Wiggins of gadget magazine Stuff. 'Apple tend to be more cagey. 'If I was Apple, and knew that Microsoft . was launching, I'd probably try and come up with something to take the . focus away from them - and nobody else can do that in quite the same way . Apple can.' Wiggins believes that Microsoft has so far played its cards close to its chest with the Surface tablet. The firm has not even confirmed a price for the gadget. The Mini launch comes as research suggests a quarter of us - 22 per . cent - own a tablet, with another three per cent regularly borrowing . someone else's tablet for web browsing. About 68 per cent of the 9,5123 adults surveyed said they purchased their tablet within the last year. The U.S. survey by the Pew Research Center also suggests the flood of . cheaper tablets, such as the Google Nexus or Amazon Fire, are weakening . Apple's grip on the market. A year ago, Apple had more than 80 per cent of the market, but this has now dropped to less around 52 per cent. The Kindle Fire has 21 per cent of the market, meanwhile Samsung's Galaxy tablet has eight per cent. Out of those surveyed, 44 per cent of adults who said they have a . smartphone, 46 per cent have an Android phone, 38 per cent, have an . iPhone and 10 per cent have a Blackberry. 'Microsoft . is the most interesting - it's a make or break thing for them, as they . have always struggled with touchscreen interfaces. 'It has the potential to be a success - but the worry is that it will be overcomplicated compared to the iPad.' However, it is Apple's iPad mini that is expected to attract most attention. 'The iPad mini is potentially huge,' said Wiggins. 'But . a lot will depend on price. There are a lot of people who would like an . iPad but can't afford one, so if it does launch and is £250, it will be . very difficult for anyone to beat.' Experts also believe that Amazon's . Kindle, which is being launched outside the US for the first time, could . be let down if not enough content is available. The gadget uses Amazon's own app and film and book stores. 'Kindle Fire is a difficult one, especially in the UK,' said Wiggins. 'It . is dependent on its content delivery, and they will have to have a lot . of UK content at launch for it to work - but Kindle is a very strong . brand now.. However, Wiggins also believes that the technique could also backfire - by confusing consumers. 'It is quite possible consumers will get confused,' he said. 'After the iPhone launched, a lot of competitors came out, and people did get confused. Most secrecy has surround the iPad Mini, a shrunken version . of Apple's market-changing tablet, is expected to launch on October 17, . with the device available in shops on November 2. Steve Jobs famously ruled on a smaller iPad, saying 'The current crop of 7-inch tablets are going to be DOA, dead on arrival. 'We don't think you can make a great tablet with a 7-inch screen.' However, devices like the Amazon Kindle and Google's Nexus 7 have shown that there is a market for smaller devices that consumers can use on public transport, causing Apple to reportedly change its mind on an 'iPad mini' with a 7 or 8 inch screen. The firm has reportedly placed orders for ten million of the devices, which are also likely to feature the firms controversial new connector. If Apple follows previous form, the event will be held in San Francisco, with a simultaneous launch on London. Images purporting to show the iPad . Mini suggest a device measuring 7.85inches, with an aluminium back-cover . similar to the most recent iPad. It is likely to sport a rear-facing . camera and come with Apple's newest 'lightning' connector, a . controversial re-design which made previous accessories and chargers . obsolete without an adapter. If Apple follows its usual design . styles, it is likely to come in white and black versions, with a choice . of WiFi only, or a 3G option. However this unconfirmed. The device, while still likely to garner a premium price-tag, will help Apple compete with the burgeoning smaller tablet market. The 7-inch Google Nexus tablet sells for £159 for the cheapest version, while Amazon is also producing a budget tablet range. Steve Jobs was . unconvinced that a smaller tablet would be a success, seeing it as a . poor compromise between a tablet and a phone. However Apple appears to have had a change of heart, particularly now that the tablet market has now matured. One issue Apple might face by launching a Mini is a fragmentation in its core product lines. Until the release of the iPhone 5, . Apple's two product lines had kept the same screen resolution, meaning . apps did not need redesigning for different devices, a problem that plagues the competing Android platform. But with the increased screen size of . the iPhone 5, some apps now have a black border, at least until the . developers update their apps, and this problem may now afflict Apple's . tablets, depending on the final size of the Mini.","Pictures show device that is significantly smaller than the regular iPad .

"By . Sam Greenhill . PUBLISHED: . 09:24 EST, 11 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 22:03 EST, 11 November 2012 . Veteran Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman, pictured, led a furious backlash by blaming 'cowards and incompetents' for George Entwistle's downfall . Jeremy Paxman provoked fears he will quit Newsnight as the BBC2 programme's chances of survival appeared to be fading last night. The fiery presenter blamed 'cowards and incompetents' for the departure of director general George Entwistle as he damned a culture of 'timeserving' and 'biddable' managers. His embittered response raised fears that he will leave the programme, where he is known for his combative questioning and refusal to tolerate evasive politicians. Even staff on the programme are beginning to question whether it will be able to survive the crisis. One BBC insider asked whether, following two separate reviews into the programme, 'it would be the kind of brand you want to be associated with'. Others believe a brief suspension is possible – until at least after Christmas – while the mess is cleared up and a new team installed. Former Newsnight presenter Peter Snow said last night: 'It is a brilliant programme. It produces wonderful stuff and has done successfully for 32 years. To end Newsnight would be absurd. But I'm afraid Newsnight have made mistakes and of course they are going to have to suffer for that.' Yesterday BBC chairman Lord Patten admitted that Newsnight could be axed, saying he would be discussing its future with acting director general Tim Davie. He did concede, however, that it would be 'sad' if the BBC stopped screening current affairs in the 10.30pm Monday to Friday slot on BBC2 – leading to speculation a new programme is being considered. Newsnight has already been wounded by its decision not to air an investigation it commissioned last year into the criminal activities of the late Jimmy Savile. Last month, following a decision by ITV to screen the allegations, Newsnight editor Peter Rippon 'stepped aside' pending the outcome of a review by Nick Pollard. I quit: George Entwistle, left, makes his resignation statement last night with BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten . That report is due within weeks but . many believe the error in broadcasting false allegations on November 2 . that a leading Tory participated in child abuse at a North Wales . children's home could prove a fatal blow for the show. BBC . insiders have been left staggered that the show's acting editor Liz . Gibbons and duty lawyers did not insist that the claims by former care . home resident Stephen Messham were put to Lord McAlpine. Radio 5 Live controller Adrian van Klaveren – installed as an overseer after Mr Rippon stepped aside – had signed off the programme's script 24 hours before it was broadcast. But it has also emerged that Mr Messham was not even shown a picture of the innocent Lord McAlpine to confirm whether or not he was his alleged attacker. Following Mr Entwistle's departure on Saturday, Paxman, the face of the programme since 1989, said the director general – a former Newsnight editor – has been 'sacrificed'. The 62-year-old said: 'George Entwistle's departure is a great shame. He has been brought low by cowards and incompetents. The real problem here is the BBC's decision, in the wake of the Hutton Inquiry, to play safe by appointing biddable people. 'They then compounded the problem by enforcing a series of cuts on programme budgets, while bloating the management. 'That is how you arrive at the current mess on Newsnight. I very much doubt the problem is unique to that programme. I had hoped that George might stay to sort this out. 'It is a great pity that a talented man has been sacrificed. While time-servers prosper.' Last night a source close to Paxman said speculation about his leaving the show was 'inevitable' but denied he would go. Labour . MP Ben Bradshaw, who sits on the Culture select committee, said: ‘I . agree with Jeremy Paxman and think this a terrible mistake.’ He too blamed ‘BBC news managers’ for the crisis, and said Mr Entwistle had been ‘hung out to dry’. He said: ‘George Entwistle has been grossly, grossly let down by BBC News managers and the people around him. BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten, right, told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that Mr Entwistle had been 'destroyed' by the botched Newsnight investigation . Some top BBC names lamented the demise of George Entwistle, but others took a different view. It took BBC Radio 5 Live presenter Victoria Derbyshire only 13 minutes from Mr Entwistle’s announcement before she tweeted: ‘Finally.’ She has previously rounded on her bosses over the Savile crisis, asking on Twitter whether all journalists would be treated as badly as Newsnight editor Peter Rippon if they, like him, made poor editorial judgments. Adam Smyth, editor of radio news at BBC Northern Ireland, mentioned rival Fox News, owned by Rupert Murdoch, when he tweeted in jest: ‘I’m going to tell everyone I work for Fox. Less embarrassing.’ ‘I was one of those MPs who quizzed . him about the Newsnight Savile inquiry a couple of weeks ago, and we . gave him a very hard time and I told him he had to get a grip. I am not . confident anyone else could have done a better job. Who else is going to . clear up this mess?’ ‘He . has been done a real injustice. He was only in the job for seven weeks. As Lord Patten said George Entwistle understood what needed to be done . at the BBC to sort out the total dysfunctionality which is clearly in . the BBC and its news management and he was doing that.’ The future of Newsnight is in doubt following former director-general George Entwistle's resignation. The announcement came after he admitted he did not know beforehand that Newsnight planned to broadcast allegations linking a senior Tory to the abuse scandal at a North Wales children's home. The allegations have since been exposed as defamatory and false. Asked whether Newsnight could now survive, Lord Patten told Sky's Murnaghan programme: 'That's one of the things we will be discussing with the acting director-general today.

From being cast away on a remote Scottish island to appearing on a chat show couch with Sophia Loren, Ben Fogle's labrador Inca was rarely far from his side. He even met his future wife Marina while both were walking their dogs. Ben Fogle and his wife Marina with their dogs Maggie (left) and Inca (right), who has died . But as all pet owners know, such a close bond makes the final passing all the more painful. And yesterday the 38-year-old presenter said he couldn't stop crying after having to take Inca to the vet to be put down at the age of 12. 'I just lost my best friend, Inca,' he wrote on Twitter. 'Heartbroken doesn't even begin to describe it.'. Earlier he had posted: 'Sometimes you have to make decisions that break your heart.' Inca had required a £5,000-a-year cocktail of medication after being diagnosed with epilepsy and arthritis. Marina, who has two children with Fogle – Ludo, two, and 13-month-old Iona, said yesterday: 'If it wasn't for Inca, Ben and I would never have met walking our dogs in Hyde Park. On top of our wedding cake we had figurines of our dogs. That is how special they have been to us.' Mr Fogle said he has not stopped crying since Inca had to be put down at the age of 12 . She added: 'It is terribly sad. Inca suffered from epilepsy, which we controlled with medication, but we decided that  as soon as she wasn't enjoying life any more we would let her  go humanely. 'The day before she died we took her to the beach with my dog, Maggi. She couldn't walk but she lay in the sand and watched the sea. In the end, it was very peaceful.' Fogle has regularly told of the close bond he shared with Inca and Maggi. 'Their enthusiasm is infectious and we feel at ease and relaxed after spending time with them,' he said two years ago. 'They complete our family.' Fogle shot to fame 12 years ago as one of 36 unknowns who spent a year on the island of Taransay for BBC reality show Castaway 2000. Allowed one luxury, he opted to bring Inca, whom he had bought as a puppy for £1,500, picking a name inspired by his recent travels to South America. Fogle has gone on to present BBC shows including Crufts, One Man and His Dog and Countryfile. He . also followed Princes William and Harry on their first joint Royal tour . in Botswana and made a documentary called Prince William’s Africa. The former magazine picture editor and his pet were an immediate hit with viewers. In her youth, he described her as a 'camera tart', needing her own dressing room when they appeared on Graham Norton's chat show because fellow guest Sophia Loren was scared of dogs. In 2004 the presenter revealed: 'She's incredibly well-behaved unless food is involved. Then she forgets everything: her training, her manners.' After one magazine photoshoot in which his mobile phone number was visible on Inca's collar, Fogle received more  than 3,000 texts and calls  from women. Last year Fogle told how he had twisted his ankle seeing off a fox which had tried to attack Inca near his London home. The TV presenter took Inca as his 'luxury item' when he travelled to the isle of Taransay for BBC show Castaway . The . father-of-two said he took Inca, his other dog Maggi and his . mother-in-law’s pet Beca - all labradors - out for a late night walk in a . private square when it pounced. 'The . younger two dogs are pretty sprightly, but Inca is 11 and is very slow . and epileptic which causes her a bit of arthritis,' he said at the time. 'It was a very large dog fox - the size of my dogs. 'When I first saw it I actually thought it was a dog.' He was yesterday too upset to talk about Inca’s death, but followers took to Twitter to express their sympathy. One posted: 'Oh no! I’m so sorry. How terribly sad.'","Presenter said last night he couldn't stop crying at loss of dog which he took to Castaway island .

Afghanistan's first female rapper Sosan Firooz is making history in her country, despite her chosen career angering some of her family members. Rap is just started to develop a following in the wartorn nation and the 23-year-old sees it as the best way to tell her story. Women performing is frowned upon in her country, but Firooz has defied convention to sing about hard-hitting subjects including the repression of women and her hopes for a peaceful Afghanistan. Scroll down for video . Outspoken: Sosan Firooz, 23, raps about the repression of women in Afghanistan, her hopes for peace in her home country . She also raps about her family's escape to Iran during the Afghan . civil war of the 1990s and the hardline Taliban regime's rise to power. Firooz has spoken openly of the misery she felt as a child during a five-year stay in a country in which she claims people looked with disdain on Afghan refugees. 'While we were in Iran, we were called ""dirty Afghans"" and told to go to the back of the line at the bakery,' said Firooz, who also spent time as a refugee in Pakistan and returned to Afghanistan with her family seven years ago. Those who leave, she sings, will only get jobs washing dishes or working at a car wash. 'They will miss their homeland,' she sings in her first single, Our Neighbors. 'They will want to kiss the dust of their homeland.' 'What is the result of Afghans being refugees in Iran and Pakistan?' she continues in Dari, one of Afghanistan's two main languages. Controversial stance: Firooz has to be accompanied by her father at all times when out for her own protection . 'Half of them are addicts and the other half are terrorists!' So far, the track has only been released on YouTube, with a video that shows a series of pictures of Firooz posing in a hip-hop style gear, with jeans, dangling chains and bracelets. In some pictures, she wears a bandana with skulls, but her long hair is not completely covered - a rarity among Afghan women, including the few female singers. Firooz is also an actress, having had small parts in a number of local TV soap operas. Earlier this month, she sang at a three-day music festival in Kabul. Because social interaction between men and women is restricted, the musicians played for a female audience the first day and male the last two days. She is still not yet widely known among Afghans, but is breaking with tradition in a very conservative society, where some women do not go outside without wearing blue burqas. Violence against women is still common in Afghanistan, especially in remote areas. There are reports of women being stoned or executed in public for having affairs with men. Women accused of adultery have been killed or imprisoned. Risky business: Some of the young woman's own relatives will not speak to her. Pictured, Firooz records a track at a studio in Kabul . Firooz sings of ending 'all cruelty against women and children.' Her uncle has cut off contact with his family because of his niece, says her father, Abdul Ghafar Firooz. He has quit his job at the government-run electric department to accompany her whenever she leaves the house and protect her as she pursues her acting and musical career. 'I am her secretary, answering her phones,' he said. 'I am her bodyguard, protecting her. When she's out, I must be with her. 'Every parent must support their daughters and sons to help them progress.' Her mother, who does humanitarian work in conservative, remote areas of southern Afghanistan, is careful not to mention her daughter's budding career. Firooz says her family's support gives her 'the strength to fight against the problems in our society'. There are a few male rappers in Afghanistan, including 28-year-old Bejan Zafarmal - nicknamed DJ Besho - and some of their CDs can be bought in the Kabul bazaar. Firooz's first -and so far only - song was arranged by well-known Afghan singer and composer Fared Rastagar, who recently returned from living in Germany and has a recording studio in Kabul. 'I admire Sosan for her courage and appreciate the support of her family,' he said. 'Rap is needed here. We need to bring changes in all parts of life including music.' It might be a long road to stardom for Firooz She lives with her family in a mud brick house in a poor neighbourhood in north Kabul. She uses an old desktop computer to write music,and was given an electronic keyboard as a gift from one of her supporters. She does not have the money to make CDs or a more elaborate music video, but she is determined to keep going. 'When war started in our country, there were bullets, artillery, rockets,' she raps. 'All our trees were burned down. The war forced us to leave our country. 'We are hopeful for the future in our country. And we ask that our neighbouring countries leave us alone.' ...and her first music video here...","Sosan Firooz raps about repression of women and childhood exile in Iran .

Competing in the Paralympic Games is tough enough - it's difficult to imagine quite how much tougher the challenge might be were you competing just days after your beloved mother had died. But Liz Johnson can imagine. The brave Welsh swimmer - who has cerebral palsy - was in Beijing preparing for her 100m breaststroke event in 2008 when she learned that her mother Bonnie, 52, had lost her gruelling battle with cervical cancer and would not see her compete. Bonnie had died while Liz was on the plane to Beijing. Faced with the agonising decision over whether to stay and compete or to fly home, Johnson, 26, chose to race - partly for Britain, partly for her mum. And when she won gold 11 days later she knew she owed it all to her mother, the woman who had always been her number one fan. Speaking to Grazia, Johnson describes the day in 2007 when she found out her mother had terminal cancer as 'the worst moment of my life'. But she also remembers how proud her mum was when she qualified for the Beijing Paralympics in the SB6 category of the 100m breaststroke, and why that memory led her to stay in China and compete, even after hearing that her mum had passed away back in Newport.

Hannah Cockcroft was told 'she'd never do anything with her life' after suffering brain damage at birth - now she's going for gold in the Paralympics . She says: 'When they said they could hold the funeral until after I'd competed, I knew I had to stay. It was one of the hardest decisions I've ever made - just leaving Mum had been fraught in itself - but she'd given up so much to give me the opportunity to achieve my dream. I owed it to her to race.' Water-baby Liz Johnson in her natural habitat at Tooting Lido . Johnson, who won silver in the event at the 2004 Athens Games, says that when she stood on the side of the pool in Beijing her mind was 'clearer than ever': . 'I'd always got so worked up about messing up in races, but this time the outcome didn't really matter. It couldn't make anything feel worse. 'As it turns out, I won gold for Britain - and for Mum. It was bittersweet. She's never see this, never hold my medal or, more importantly, hold me again. But I know she'd have been so happy for me.' Liz Johnson sports the gold medal she won in Beijing as she lays the final tile in the floor of the London aquatic centre in 2011 . Johnson, who trains in Manchester, was born hemiplegic, meaning that the right side of her brain is smaller and weaker than the left. Bonnie, a teacher, took her daughter to swimming lessons to strengthen her muscles - which can weaken as a result of the condition - and it was soon obvious that Liz had a real gift in the water. The champion swimmer says that despite her mother and father Shane having split up when she and her younger sister Robyn were still small, her mother still found the time to help her daugher, and sacrificed a lot in terms of having her own life in order to attend Liz's swimming events: 'We spent so much time on the road together and grew close.'

A blind Native American, 69, is accusing staff at a local hospital of negligence and racism after he emerged from open heart surgery with scars all over his body which appeared to spell out KKK. Vernon Traversie, from Cheyenne River Indian Reservation in South Dakota, had a heart attack last August and was rushed to Rapid City Regional Hospital. After surgery he was in a lot of pain. Mr Traversie said he told one of the male nurses he needed medication and claims he was abusive towards him. This was on top of the scarring from surgery. Rapid City police say they conducted an investigation but found no evidence of a crime. Scroll down for video . Racism: Vernon Traversie speaks on the video about the maltreatment he claims he received at the Rapid City Regional Hospital because he is a Native American . Scars: Vernon Traversie shows off the scars he still bears today - almost one year after the surgery . Hospital: Rapid City police say they conducted an investigation into the care Mr Traversie received but found no evidence of a crime . Though he complained, no one did anything about it. 'I told them I had a confrontation with a male nurse while I was in intensive care,' he said. 'I was in so much pain, I begged him for pain medication. 'He told me to shut my f***ing mouth or he’d shut it for me. I didn’t provoke him. I didn’t disrespect him.' When he asked to be sent to a rehabilitation center because the pain was so bad, they said this was approved - but instead discharged him. On the day he was discharged, a nurse at the hospital told Mr Traversie that he should get someone to take a picture of the surgery scars on his stomach and his back. The nurse said she would not testify on his behalf but couldn't live with herself without at least alerting him to the scars. She said to him: 'My conscience won’t let me be. It’s bothered me for days. Something was done to you, and I believe it was wrong. 'I can’t sleep. I keep thinking about what they did to you.' His pastor came over the following day and took pictures of his abdomen and back and continued to throughout the healing process to document it. An open heart surgery wound is typically between five and ten inches long. There may be slight scarring or bruising from surgical tape around it. In Mr Traversie's case, he has deep wounds all over his stomach and some on his back. Several of the wounds look in the shape of the letter K. He told the Indian Country Today Media Network: 'You can see the surgery sutures, and they’re clean. 'But those three letters, two good-sized Ks and one smaller one off to the side, had to be made with some sharp knife or heated instrument. It’s like they branded me.' Scars: Mr Traversie had an old wound reopened on his back and two more cuts above it. On his abdomen the letters K can be seen . Point out: A YouTube video made about his story shows where the K letters are for those who do not recognize them. It was a nurse who first alerted Mr Traversie to the scars . A friend of the 69-year-old who made a YouTube video about the case, said they also cut down through an existing surgery scar and carved two vertical lines above the older scar. This is what a scar from heart surgery SHOULD look like (file photo) The hospital have attributed the extra wounds to surgical tape or to infections related to his diabetes. Since the video of what happened to the Native American was posted online, hundreds of people have expressed their shock and disgust over what happened and took to the streets on Monday to protest. Supporters, led by American Indian Movement founder Dennis Banks, marched for two miles waving American Indian flags from rapid City plaza to the hospital where Mr Traversie was operated on. Hap Marshall, 69, a resident of the Cheyenne River reservation, said: 'We’re classified as second class citizens. But when they want our votes, we’re their brother.' A group of about 15 people - including Banks and Oglala Sioux Vice President Tom Poor Bear - met with officials at the hospital, while police prevented other supporters from entering the building. The hospital released a statement saying: 'We believe the meeting with leaders of the rally yesterday provided an opportunity to learn more about each other’s perspectives. 'Rapid City Regional Hospital is an organization of people who have dedicated our lives to healing others. We are deeply committed to providing excellent care to everyone, regardless of race. No one at RCRH would stand by idly and allow abuse to occur in this hospital. 'We proactively seek feedback from patients and we listen to their concerns. Upon admission, patients are provided a document outlining their rights and who to call if they have concerns. Administration, Directors, and Supervisors routinely visit with patients, inquire about their care, and answer any questions. 'Our Patient Relations team works with patients to address individual concerns. Additionally, we have a team of people who randomly survey patients about their care they received once the patient returns home. 'In the rare instances when a patient has a complaint, we investigate it thoroughly. If a patient files a complaint with local law enforcement or an outside regulatory organization, then we fully cooperate in the investigation with all local, state, or federal agencies. 'Once again, in the absence of a written release, we are severely restricted from commenting on the care of any patient. We would welcome the opportunity to discuss the specifics of any case if allowed to do so by the patient or their representative. 'We at RCRH are confident of the care we provide without bias or consideration of race, religion, national origin or payer classification.'

A killer was caught on camera stalking his victim minutes after she was refused a lift home by police. Carl Powell, 24, was filmed walking a few yards behind Caroline Coyne in the residential street in which she would meet her death. Six minutes later he is pictured running away after battering the 28-year-old mother of two to death with a lump of concrete. Scroll down for video . Stalker on CCTV: Caroline Coyne (right) walks on one side of the road, with Carl Powell (left) on the other . Tragic: Police suggested Caroline Coyne (left), 28, should call a cab when she asked for a life, but she walked away and within an hour had been attacked in Nottingham by Carl Powell (right), 24, who has been jailed for life . After leaving relatives at around 11pm, Miss Coyne climbed into the back of a marked police car and asked to be taken home, Nottingham Crown Court heard. The officers told the jury they advised her to get a taxi, adding: ‘We are not a taxi service.’ She then tried to board an out-of-service bus before heading toward the road in which she was murdered. One after the other: Ms Coyne (left) was seen quickly passing a CCTV camera, soon followed by Powell (right) Spotted again: Later, Powell (top left) was seen on the same camera running back in the opposite direction . Her body was found in an alleyway the next morning. Miss Coyne is believed to have been killed there after refusing Powell’s demands for sex. Speaking outside court, Ms Coyne's stepfather Jason Stansfield said the family held Nottinghamshire Police responsible for putting her in the path of her murderer that night. He said the police could have used their powers to take Ms Coyne home when she jumped into their car, as she was clearly intoxicated and in need of assistance. ‘Instead they were dismissive of her and, in the words of the defence barrister Mr Smith, she was treated as an inconvenience,’ Mr Stansfield said. ‘The two officers simply pointed her in the direction of home and watched her stagger off for a few seconds until she disappeared from view. ‘It is the family's opinion that Caroline was failed by Nottinghamshire Police that night (who had) the chance to ensure a vulnerable young woman, worse the wear for drink, was taken to a place for safety. 'So the police, in our opinion, failed Caroline and their advice to take a taxi put her right in the path of her murderer.’ Mr Stansfield added that a bus driver and a colleague, who drove past Ms Coyne and swerved out of her way when she stepped into the road and tried to flag the vehicle down, were also accountable. ‘The bus was not in regular service,’ he said. ‘It was effectively a taxi for other bus drivers finishing their shifts and did not come off duty until 5am that day.’ He added: ‘I was always led to believe that bus drivers would give free passage to children and vulnerable adults if it was needed. Caroline flagged them down and was asking for help and was ignored. ‘The bus driver who was a passenger on that bus reported during the trial they get drunk people a lot flagging them down and it was normal. ‘So too it seems was their callousness and disregard for public safety whilst at the same time expecting their custom.’ A second camera had earlier captured . Powell watching Miss Coyne  wandering apparently the worse for drink . after a family gathering. Yesterday he was jailed for life with a minimum term of 20 years after being found guilty of murdering Miss Coyne and sexually assaulting another woman he dragged off the street a month later. The man who found Miss Coyne’s body was awoken by her cries of ‘Get off me’ but went back to bed when he failed to find anyone outside. A post-mortem examination found she died of head injuries. At the time of the attack – in July 2011 – she was living in Top Valley, Nottingham, with her partner and sons, aged seven and one. The court heard that Powell’s second victim was also walking home after a night out in Nottingham when he grabbed her by the throat and dragged her into the grounds of a college where he assaulted her. She persuaded Powell not to harm her further and was able to recall enough of the encounter to help  police identify him. The 22-year-old said yesterday that she believes she survived the attack by remaining calm and trying ‘to convince him I liked him’ – promising that she would meet him again on another day. Powell was found guilty of false imprisonment, false imprisonment with intent to commit a sexual offence and sexual assault in relation to that attack and was handed a concurrent four-year jail term. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Flaux said Powell had ‘effectively stalked’ Miss Coyne, putting on gloves and a hood before following her down a garden pathway. He added: ‘Only you know what happened in that dark alleyway, but it is clear you cornered and attacked her. You subjected Caroline to a savage attack, bludgeoning her over her head, causing injuries from which she would die alone and defenceless.’ After the verdict, Detective Chief Inspector Tony Heydon of Nottinghamshire Police said many officers were asked for lifts home and the two in this case had acted in accordance with protocol. The victim’s mother, Mandy Coyne, said her grandchildren could not understand ‘why their mummy isn’t around’. Plea for help: Ms Coyne was seen on a bus . CCTV camera trying to wave it down just minutes before she died . Assistance plea: The driver of the out-of-service bus was taking staff members home when he spotted her . Dangerous: The driver claimed he was forced to brake and swerve to prevent the bus from hitting Ms Coyne . Caroline's mother Mandy Coyne said: 'Caroline (right) was a beautiful little girl, who grew into a strong-willed and determined young woman. She lived for her two sons, and played a big part in our family life. 'Her murder has devastated everyone and it has been so difficult for us all, and especially her boys to understand why their mummy isn’t around.'Cameron, who is now nine, keeps asking questions about what happened and who did this. While it doesn’t change the fact she can’t see them grow up, it will be slightly easier now to explain to him that the person who did this has been sent to prison.'Caroline had an extremely loving nature. She is missed every day and somehow we have to find a way of living without her.'I would also like to thank my family and friends for their support, the prosecution, DCI Tony Heydon, DC Mark Petrovic, Emily and Kathy from victim support.'

Derren Brown's former cleaner was jailed for 16 months today for stealing blank cheques from the illusionist's home which were cashed in for more than £33,000. Former teacher Rocio Pavon-Navarrete, 47, previously admitted stealing two signed cheques from the entertainer's home while he was absent. Brown - famed for 'reading people's minds' - was away on his 2010 Enigma tour at the time. She pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court last month to one charge of theft. The cheques were signed by Brown's manager, James Cooper, but were left blank and stored at his home in Westminster for use by his assistant while the TV star and Mr Cooper were away on business. Famed at being able to predict future events - including the winning lottery numbers - Derren Brown failed to spot his cleaner stealing from him . Pavon-Navarrete, of Greenwich, south-east London, took the cheques when her two businesses began to struggle. The . cleaner then passed them to friend Bernard Ayanbanjo, 48, who paid them . into his account banking one for £11,500 and the other for £21,550.35. After sentencing her to 16 months' imprisonment at Southwark Crown Court, the judge said that she had lied and her only regret was being caught. Pavon-Navarrete was dismissed by Mr Brown in June 2010 but he did not realise the money had gone missing until his accountant noticed unusual transactions six months later. Bernard Ayanbanjo (right) and Rocio Pavon-Navarrete (left) faced the court after £33,000 was plundered from the star's account . Mr Brown, who is famed for his ability . to predict events including the winning lottery numbers, was only . alerted it might be her after receiving a handwritten letter casting . doubt on the honesty of his cleaners. However but it took police almost a year to make an arrest despite the fact that she was always the ‘prime suspect.’ Channel 4 star Mr Brown joked afterwards: 'I suppose I should have seen this coming.' The court heard the . cleaner may have done it out of revenge when she was made redundant . after working for Mr Brown for seven years. But James Holland, defending, claimed the parting between the pair had been ‘amicable’ and said her only motive was money. He told the court: 'She has two . businesses. They were struggling due to a loss of a sum of money which . was stolen. This was reported to police. Her problems started there. 'She . was under a degree of pressure in terms of finances and she succumbed . to that pressure. She had the opportunity to take two cheques and she . did so. For that she is extremely sorry. 'She . is genuinely sorry for what she has done. She felt once she had done . she was trapped and could not see an escape out of it.' The barrister said Ayanbanjo, who was a regular customer in her shop, told her he was interested in buying cheques which he would use as guarantees so she passed them on to him. But he claimed his client never received any money from the amount that was cashed by Ayanbanjo. However Judge David Higgins said he believed that was a ‘self-serving untruth.’ He said: 'Until you pleaded guilty you have lied throughout this case and it is plain you have continued to lie.' He added he did not accept her expressions of remorse and said: 'They are quite inconsistent with your conduct throughout this case. No doubt you regret being caught but in my judgment nothing more.' The Ecuadorian mother-of-three, who used to teach geography and history in her home country, came to the UK in 1999 and has now been granted citizenship. She is putting two of her sons through university as one is studying economics at Lancaster and the other is taking a Masters degree in electrical engineering in Greenwich. The court heard she has one previous conviction for shoplifting in 2004. But the judge said: 'This matter is so serious only an immediate custodial sentence can reap it justice. The proper and least sentence which I may impose is one of 16 months.' Pavon-Navarrete, of Greenwich, south east London, admitted theft from her employer between April and June 2010. She changed her plea to guilty just before her trial was due to start last month. She had previously failed to turn up at court claiming she was in hospital with chest pains. She suffered a heart attack in 2010 and was due to have an MRI scan later this month but Judge Higgins previously told her: 'They have very good medical facilities in Holloway.' Pavon-Navarrate showed no emotion as she was led down to the cells. To date just £950 of the cash has been recovered by police. Ayanbanjo, of Woolwich, south east London, was also supposed to be sentenced today after being convicted of two counts of fraud between October and December 2010 but it was put back until October 19.","'Mind reader' was on 2010 Enigma tour when cleaner took the cheques because her own business was struggling .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 09:33 EST, 17 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:01 EST, 18 October 2012 . David Cameron was tonight scrambling to rescue his plan to force energy companies to give all their customers their cheapest deals, amid growing doubt about how it will work in practice. The Prime Minister arrived for talks with European leaders in Brussels trying to clarify his announcement, after Downing Street earlier refused to confirm it would be included in the forthcoming Energy Bill. Mr Cameron insisted he wanted to be 'on the side of hard pressed, hard working families who often struggle to pay energy bills' after opponents accused him of making up policy 'on the hoof'. David Cameron today toured a building site in Victoria, central London, as Downing Street struggled to explain his announcement on energy bills . The Prime Minister's pledge to legislate 'so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers' appears to be unravelling . Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions yesterday, Mr Cameron said: ‘I can announce that we will be legislating so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers.' But the new policy caught the Department for Energy and Climate Change on the hop, and more than 24 hours later there was still no detail of how it will work. Energy minister John Hayes was forced to . appear in the Commons to explain the policy, but admitted he had not known Mr Cameron planned to make the announcement. He promised only to 'get . people lower tariffs' with 'different options' still being considered. He added: 'This is a complicated area which will discuss with the industry, consumer groups and the regulator in order to work through the detail.' A Number 10 spokeswoman later suggested the Energy Bill would only 'put the obligation on the energy companies to offer the lowest tariffs to more people'. Asked if she could guarantee that Mr Cameron's announcement would be included in the legislation, she added: 'We are looking at various options.' But arriving at a Brussels summit today, Mr Cameron sought to clarify his announcement. He insisted: 'We are going to use the forthcoming legislation, the Energy Bill coming up this year, so we make sure, we ensure, that customers get the lowest tariffs.' He also tweeted: 'I want to be on the side of hard working families. We're going to use the energy bill to ensure customers get lowest tariffs.' Downing Street sources suggested the final policy would still allow choice between types of tariffs. One option being considered is that people on a variable tariff and pay by direct debit could be informed by their provider that they are going to be automatically switched to the lowest variable direct debit tariff from the same provider. Customers would be able to opt-out of automatic switching. Going up: The average annual dual-fuel bill is already at a record high of £1,300 and last week four energy companies announced above-inflation rises . But the confusion has dismayed consumer groups who hoped real help would be offered to hard-pressed households. Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, said: 'The Prime Minister must stick to the promise he made in Parliament to legislate so energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers. 'Just giving people information on the lowest tariff is not enough when trust is at an all time low in the industry and switching levels are falling. Which? has been pressing the Government for years to make sure people get a better deal so we must now see these words turned into action."" The average annual dual-fuel bill is already at a record high of £1,300 and last week four energy companies announced above-inflation rises. Mr Cameron said householders would no longer face a bewildering range of tariffs, which leave millions paying more than £100 a year too much for their fuel. Often cut price introductory offers are used to get people to switch between companies but when they run out customers find themselves on much higher tariffs. It was suggested Mr Cameron's new policy would be written into the Energy Bill. But Energy Secretary Ed Davey gave a . major speech to the CBI this morning on how the legislation would make . 'bills affordable', but made no mention of Mr Cameron's announcement. Asked . later about the surprise announcement, Mr Davey said: 'Making sure we . have competitive markets and consumers face the lowest energy bills . possible is a top priority for me.' Energy minister John Hayes was forced to appear in the Commons to explain the Prime Minister's announcement . He suggested the government would only legislate for voluntary agreements secured earlier this year, under which the major energy firms would tell customers what the best available tariffs were. Mr Hayes was hauled before the Commons after Speak John Bercow granted the Urgent Question after a request from the Labour party. A Labour source said today: 'This is a policy unravelling by the minute. It says a lot about David Cameron's lack of attention to detail that they have got in this mess.' Mr Hayes was appointed as energy minister in last month's reshuffle. Earlier this year, Nick Clegg said the six biggest firms would write to customers once a year offering better tariffs after it emerged that 75 per cent of customers could be entitled to lower bills. Mr Hayes told MPs: 'We will use the Energy Bill to get people lower tariffs and of course there are different options to be considered in the process.' But Ms Flint, the shadow energy secretary, said Mr Cameron's announcement risked damaging the industry. 'It caused chaos in the energy industry and I have to say it left his own ministers at a loss as to what energy policy actually is. 'For the Government to spend a day pretending they have a policy they have no intention of implementing is no way to run the country. It is like something out of The Thick of It.' Downing Street said yesterday the new law would put an ‘obligation’ on firms to put customers on the best deal to suit their circumstances. But in a further sign of the policy unravelling, the 'obligation' today became an 'offer' of lower tariffs. Greenpeace branded the confusion an 'energy omnishambles'. Executive director John Sauven said: 'The government’s energy policy is now as confusing as British Gas tariffs. Even if what Cameron announced yesterday was actual policy, it would fail to protect consumers from higher bills. Until the Government reduces our reliance on gas, the cheapest tariff will still be an expensive tariff.' Mr Cameron said householders would no longer face a bewildering range of tariffs, which leave millions paying more than £100 a year too much for their fuel . Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at price comparison website uSwitch.com, said she thought the announcement had been a 'mistake'. 'The unintended consequences would be to kill competition. Consumers will be left with Hobson’s . choice – there will be no spur, no choice, no innovation and no reason . for consumers to engage any more.' Research by price comparison  uSwitch found that households . can already save £135 by choosing a cheaper tariff from their supplier, . or up to £300 by switching to a different supplier. Annual bills have soared by an average . of £200 since 2010, despite the Prime Minister’s ‘energy summit’ last . year with the major companies. Last week, British Gas, npower, Scottish Power and SSE announced rises of up to 9 per cent to be implemented before Christmas. The other two major energy companies, E.ON and EDF, have yet to announce next year’s increases. Energy UK, which represents the Big Six companies, said it needed to know 'the detail of what's being proposed by the Prime Minister and how this might impact our members’ customers across the country'. 'We will be legislating so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers' Prime Minister David Cameron . People who get discounts by paying . online, not having paper bills or buying gas and electricity from the . same supplier could see their bills rise, it was warned. Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which?, wrote to Mr Cameron this week to say that the energy market was ‘broken’ and called for a review into the recent price rises. He said yesterday’s announcement ‘acknowledges that competition in the energy retail market has failed’. Changes: Caroline Flint MP, Labour's energy and climate change spokeswoman, said there is a need to 'completely overhaul our energy market to break the dominance of the big six energy companies' Caroline Flint MP, Labour’s shadow energy secretary, told BBC2's Newsnight: ‘The truth is, this policy isn’t going anywhere because the Prime Minister actually announced a policy that within 10 hours has disappeared. 'We need transparency so we can see when the companies say ""we can’t do this because we need to invest,"" whether what they’re saying is right and we need to know that when wholesale prices come down, they pass on those cuts to the consumers just the same way as they do when they go up.' 'We want all energy customers to have access to good value tariffs and assistance in reducing their bills' Angela Knight CBE, Energy UK chief executive . Angela Knight CBE, chief executive of Energy UK, which represents the industry, said: ‘We want all energy customers to have access to good value tariffs and assistance in reducing their bills. ‘Energy companies in Britain have already reduced the complexity of their offers and made them much clearer and easier to understand. ‘They have also contacted millions of households to offer help with insulation and to point out the discounts available. And there are more initiatives under way already to help consumers further.’","The PM promised to change law to make sure everyone gets the best deal .

Four years ago, when Barack Obama was a presidential candidate on the verge of creating history, his young family were often seen by his side on the campaign trail. But this time around - after four difficult years in the world's most powerful job before a watchful media - there was a noticeable absence during Obama's re-election campaign. The President's daughters Sasha, 11, and 14-year-old Malia were rarely seen with him - in stark contrast to Republican opponent Mitt Romney, who often paraded his adult sons, their wives and grandchildren at events and rallies. Scroll down to watch... Growing up: The President's daughters Sasha and Malia have not been seen with him during this election campaign -  in stark contrast to four years ago (pictured right) when they were often by his side. The girls, pictured left, were on stage in Chicago following their father's victory speech . Delighted: Sasha, second left, and Malia, right, looked thrilled on stage last night with their mother Michelle and victorious father . Change: The President's daughters have not only grown up from four years ago but also look more confident and self-assured in the limelight . Following his election night victory speech at Chicago's McCormick Place Convention Center, Obama was joined on stage by First Lady Michelle and his two daughters. The 10,000-strong crowd at his Illinois campaign headquarters waved flags wildly and danced around as Obama hugged his delighted daughters. The pair looked proud as their father thanked their mother and also paid tribute to his girls. Obama said they were ‘two smart, beautiful young women, just like their mother’. But if the girls were hoping that their father's election night success would soften him up to buy another pet, he disappointed them, adding: 'One dog is probably enough’. The Obamas embraced Vice President Joe Biden and his wife Jill, along with crowds of relatives and supporters, as Bruce Springsteen's anthem We Take Care Of Our Own blared over the speakers. Both Sasha and Malia have clearly grown from the young, shy girls of four years ago. After four years in the White House, with their dad as President, their lives are no doubt unrecognizable from how they lived before. Happy family: The President with his wife and daughters, Sasha (left with her father, carrying her Obama campaign bag) and Malia (hand-in-hand with Michelle), board Air Force One at Chicago O'Hare Airport today as they head home to the White House .

Pleased: The Obama family look on in delight as Vice President Joe Biden walks on stage . Barack and Michelle appeared to have taken steps to shield their daughters from the grueling rigors of the campaign trail. The girls were last seen in public on . October 28 when they attended church in Washington D.C. with their father . and godmother Kaye Wilson. They . also appeared at the Democratic National Convention on September 6 in . North Carolina, where they waved from the stage as their father accepted . the presidential nomination. During the campaign, the Obama girls were mostly kept out of the limelight. Republican contender Mitt Romney was regularly surrounded by his children and grandchildren at the presidential . debates - whereas Obama was only pictured with the First Lady. In a New Hampshire radio interview on Election Day, Obama spoke about how being a parent is not always easy.  A co-host’s 12-year-old daughter, called Taylor, had prepared a question for Obama. She asked him: 'Mr President, my mom won't let me date until I'm 16. Do you allow your daughters to date yet?' Obama said that Sasha, 11, his younger daughter, did not yet seem to be interested in dating. He said that for Malia, 14, now in high school, there hadn't been 'anything official' yet. 'I would say that you should talk it through with your parents and the time will be right where there's nothing wrong with a young man coming by, introducing himself, being very proper and polite and making sure that you guys get home at a reasonable time,' he said. Rare appearance: The girls were last seen in public on October 28 as they attended church in Washington D.C. with their father and godmother Kaye Wilson . Last outing: The girls have very much been kept out of the public eye - unlike four years ago. This was them pictured on October 28 . Happy: Apart from the October 28 outing, the President's daughters were last seen at the Democratic National Convention on September 6 . Funny: Malia, left, and Sasha, right, and First Lady Michelle listen as their father speaks at the Democratic National Convention . 'But I'm going to leave that up to your mom to make sure that she sets the ground rules.' Obama said that ‘being a parent's not always easy, Taylor’ and added: ‘I know you guys think you have it rough, but being a parent's not too easy, either. We worry about you guys so much because we love you so much.’ Barack has also previously spoken about his worries over his daughters as they grow up in the public eye. He told MTV last month that he was concerned about Malia going on Facebook because she was so well-known. Obama said: 'I'm very keen on protecting her privacy. She can make her own decisions as she gets older, but right now, for security reasons, she does not have a Facebook page.' In 2008, Obama's two daughters were by his side during a lot of the campaign, wearing T-shirts and being involved in events like packing boxes for overseas troops. He drew criticism when he allowed his daughters to be interviewed by Access Hollywood four years ago. Malia and Sasha, ten and seven at the time, spoke on camera, in an interview which was then splashed across the TV networks. United: Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney with his wife Ann and the rest of his family crowd onto the stage after conceding defeat. His adult children and grandchildren had often appeared at his side throughout the campaign . Together: Despite Obama's young daughters not been seen in public during the campaign, Mitt Romney was often pictured with his family. He is pictured watching his grandchildren play Jenga before the final presidential debate . Touching: Obama greets one of Mitt Romney's grandchildren after the final presidential debate . When asked about the decision, Obama said he was surprised by the attention the interview had garnered before adding: 'We wouldn’t do it again and we won’t be doing it again.' Although their father could be attempting to shield his daughters from the viciousness of the presidential campaign, there could also be one simple answer - both Malia and Sasha are mid-way through term at the private Sidwell Friends School they attend in D.C. In the Republican camp during the election campaign, Romney was almost constantly accompanied by members of his large family, including his wife of 42 years Ann, his five sons and their wives and many of his 18 grandchildren, who are often photographed on his campaign jet. Republican Vice President nominee Paul Ryan also had his children along for the ride in the last days of the campaign. His ten-year-old daughter Liza, who is close in age to Sasha Obama, has been pictured striking a number of comic poses while her father appears at events in swing states. His son Charlie, eight, appears shy . while the youngest, seven-year-old Sam, often steals the show with a . beaming grin for the waiting press. The . trio appear to be enjoying the shift from their lives in small town . Janesville, Wisconsin, to motorcades across the country, posing in . Romney-Ryan hats and t-shirts and attending football games. Growing up in the public eye: One of the earliest pictures of the Obama family was taken in 2004 while he was in the running for the Senate . While . Michelle Obama is a seasoned and prolific campaigner for her husband's . cause, Malia and Sasha have been kept out of the public eye by their . parents. The First Lady has often spoken of her desire for the girls to grow up 'normal' and learn the values of kindness, humility and respect for other people. At the presidential debates, Michelle Obama supported her husband from the audience with members of his campaign team  - but without their girls. The Romney camp were pictured in the audience and following the debate with their grandchildren as they met the Obamas. Now as President Obama enters his second term, their two daughters can look forward to another four years growing up in Washington. By the time they leave, Malia and Sasha will have spent almost half their lives in the White House.","Malia, 14, and 11-year-old Sasha joined Obama on stage following Election Night victory speech after being kept out of the public eye during grueling campaign .

Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy said that once the Euro had resolved its problems 'the time for the referendum will be upon us' A referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union should be held once the Eurozone crisis is over, a senior member of Ed Miliband’s frontbench team said today. Jim Murphy, the shadow defence secretary, claimed ‘almost everyone’ in the Labour party would campaign for Britain to stay in the EU. There are growing signs of that Labour could still a march on the Conservatives and promise to hold a vote on the EU after the next election. Last night Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary, insisted there was ‘ almost total unanimity for Britain’s continued membership in the European Union’ in the Labour party. However, some senior Labour figures are understood to be unenthusiastic about the prospect of having to defend a Brussels bureaucracy which they believe is bloated and runs counter to Britain’s interests. Jon Cruddas, who is leading Labour’s policy review, last week said he would examine the case for an in/out referendum. But former leader Lord Kinnock described the prospect of a referendum as ‘a gigantic distraction (which) would disable political and economic activity in the rest of the EU’. However, other senior members of the Labour frontbench now think such a vote is inevitable. Mr Murphy today told BBC2's Daily . Politics show : ‘I think at some point, there will have to be a . referendum on the EU ... I don't think it's for today or for the next . year, but I think it should happen.’ He . appeared to be agreeing with Lord Mandelson, who last week suggested . the Eurozone will be smaller after the single currency had resolved its . problems and settled on a new political and fiscal deal. Jim Murphy (left) yesterday joined shadow chancellor Ed Balls for the annual Labour vs The Press football match . Mr Murphy said: ‘I think after that, the time for the referendum will be upon us. ‘I don't have a calendar with a date circled. I think we will do it when the time is right. ‘My preference would be an in-or-out referendum when the time comes. ‘Whenever the referendum comes, almost everyone in the Labour Party, along with the Liberal Democrats and British business, will be arguing we should stay part of the EU, because it is good for our economy and good for Britain.’ However tonight the party tried to play down Mr Murphy's remarks. A senior Labour source said: 'No one can fully predict where Europe will be in a few months' time, nevermind a few years' time. 'So Labour is very clear on this. This is not a decision we could or should sensibly make now.' The issue of Europe is expected to dominate the Conservative party conference next week. The UK Independence Party has offered to form an electoral pact and not challenge Eurosceptic Tory MPs at the 2015 election, but only if Mr Cameron commit to a referendum ‘in blood’. The same deal could apply yo Labour. In interviews last week the Prime Minister Cameron hinted that he might be ready to call an EU referendum after the 2015 general election. He said that the coming years would see ‘opportunities for a new settlement between Britain and Europe’ which would require ‘fresh consent from the British people’. UKIP leader leader Nigel Farage said today: 'First it was the Tories offering the British people consent on the never-never. Now we see Labour doing much the same. 'It won't wash. Poll after poll shows that we want a say, we want it now, and we want it on a simple, transparent question. In or out. 'The political elite are running scared of public opinion on our relationship with the EU. Muddying the waters, writing promissory notes about what might happen in 10 years' time, is no longer acceptable.'","Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy says once the eurozone crisis has passed, the 'time for a referendum will be upon us'

An aristocratic couple who live on a tiny island off the Cornish coast have sold their home for £1million after years of fighting to ban stag and hen parties. After more than a decade, Lord and Lady Long are moving out of their home on Towan Island, which is connected to the mainland in Newquay by a 100ft crossing. The only house in the UK with its own suspension bridge, it went on the market two years ago and has now been snapped up by a buyer who does not currently live in the area. Scroll down for video . Splendid isolation: The beautiful home is the only one in the UK with its own suspension bridge . 'Lively': At low tide, the water around the island ebbs away and it is surrounded by holidaymakers . Popular beach: The aristocratic couple are leaving Towan Island, which has just 50 residents, after more than a decade . Elderly: The couple insisted they were not leaving because of the revelry - which they said had been curbed by the council - but because the swaying bridge and slippery steps made their home hard to access . The Longs bought it for £500,000 as a holiday home in 2001, and . loved it so much they stayed. They believe it will continue to be used as a family home. Towan - once said to be the world’s smallest inhabited isle - is completely surrounded by water at high tide, offering spectacular views on all sides. But the couple soon found themselves at odds with Newquay's famous party . culture, which sees drunken revellers having public sex and people taking drugs on the beach. Lady Helen Long has spent years . campaigning against the hundreds of revellers who hold . parties on beaches at the foot of the 80ft rock. Towan Beach is a mecca for stag and hen . dos and Lady Long once threatened to sue the local council for not doing . enough to stop the late-night celebrations. Lady Long wrote to Restormel Borough Council to . complain about the parties in summer 2003 - during which there were two reported rapes in one week. Sad farewell: Lord and Lady Long say they growing old and can no longer negotiate the slippery steps and swaying bridge . Crackdown: Lady Helen Long wrote a four-page letter to the council insisting that the mayhem had to stop . She had earlier asked the authority if . she could extend the bungalow so she could build a quieter bedroom . facing away from the beach, but had been refused. In a four-page letter, Lady Long - whose husband was a Tory whip . in the Thatcher and Major years - told the . council that it had a duty to bring the mayhem on the beach to an end. Many in the town were shocked by the . negative publicity but others agreed with the Longs and formed the . Newquay Action Group to get the place cleaned up.

Two-year-old Gage Lefevers of Gaston County has been confirmed as the first fatality related to the outbreak that has so far sickened 14 children and six adults who attended the fair.

Deadly connection: All inflicted with the deadly bacteria attended the Cleveland County Fair between September 26 and October 7 but the site has yet to be declared the source . Victims: So far 14 children and six adults have fallen victim to the bacteria transferred from animal waste with the latest being five-year-old Hannah Roberts, pictured . 'It saddens me for a little boy that young,’ Claudine Cobb, a secretary at the church Gage and his family attended told WSOC through tears. ‘But he's with Jesus now. I know where he's at.' Gage died at Charlotte’s Levine Children Hospital on Friday afternoon. He was one of six hospitalized with four said to currently have a life threatening strain of the bacteria that affects the kidneys. Among the latest victims is five-year-old Hannah Roberts. Jordan McNair, 12, who's currently hospitalized at Levine Children Hospital is one of three on kidney dialysis. 'The fair should have been a safer place,' Jordan's grandmother Bennie McClannon told WSOC. Family said Jordan was doing much better on Thursday but that he's not out of the woods yet. Critical condition: Jordan McNair, 12, who attended the fair and played in its petting zoo is currently one of three on dialysis after contracting a life-threatening strain of the bacteria . Hopeful end: Wednesday marked the end of the bacteria's incubation period making health officials believe they won't find any more cases of the bacteria unless spreading through outside contact . 'It was rough,' his older sister Hayley Totherow told WBTV. 'Just hoping every morning that I would hear good news. And when I didn't hear that, it just scared me.' She said Jordan had visited the fair's petting zoo where he milked a cow on September 30. He also ate two corn dogs. The next day he began to feel sick in what doctors first thought to have been appendicitis. The bacteria are found in the waste of animals, and people who touch contaminated material such as food or animals can transfer the bacteria to their mouths or to other people. Cleveland County Fair director Calvin Hastings says the fair tried to prevent E. coli problems by adding hand-washing stations and moving food vendors farther away from animals. Health officials say Wednesday marked the end of the bacteria's incubation period, 11 days after the fair ended prompting them to believe any new cases directly linked to the fair will not appear. It can still spread through human contact, however. ‘In some cases in young children, this infection can lead to serious complications, so parents should not send sick children to day care or to school to avoid passing it on to others,’ State Health Director Laura Gerald, the State Laboratory for Public Health, told WBTV.","Victims consist of 14 children and six adults who attended the Cleveland County Fair .

The rover dumped its second soil sample back on the lunar surface before picking up a third to analyse . Engineers have also been giving Curiosity's chemical analysis instrument a dust bath.

A pregnant woman who lost 41 pints of blood after she developed a severe form of pre-eclampsia has made a miracle recovery. Poh Parcell, 37, and her husband Colin, 54, are now at home with their baby daughter Angolina just weeks after the traumatic culmination of her pregnancy. Mrs Parcell lost six pints of blood while undergoing an emergency caesarean section and continued losing blood as she was put into a 12-hour induced coma in intensive care. Poh Parcell, 37, with her husband Colin, 54 and their baby Angolina . She had developed HELLP syndrome - a complication that affects one in five women who suffer severe pre-eclampsia - two weeks before her due date. Poh’s organs began to fail as she suffered the loss of 41 pints of blood in total - five times the amount that is usually contained in a human body. Hull Royal Infirmary even ran out of blood platelets, with some having to be drafted in from a hospital in Leeds 70 miles away as a team of medics including three gynaecologists and four anaesthetists raced against time to stop Poh bleeding to death on the operating table. Colin, who rushed his wife to hospital 30 miles away from their home in Bridlington, East Yorkhire, has warned against the dangers of the deadly condition. He said: 'It’s a miracle. I thought I was losing both of them.' During the early hours of October 5, Colin heard Poh banging on the upstairs bedroom floor trying to get his attention. He found her vomiting blood and suffering chest pains and rushed her straight to hospital. Rapeewan Parcell, known as Poh, was treated at Hull Royal Infirmary. The hospital had to send to Leeds General for extra blood . He said: 'I didn’t know what was happening. I just knew that I had to do something. She was vomiting blood. 'I live 30 miles away from the hospital so I wasn’t waiting for an ambulance. I got her into the car and rushed to hospital. 'I was told later if I had been ten or 15 minutes longer, I could have lost them both.' Within 20 minutes, Poh had been diagnosed with pre-eclampsia and was on her way to theatre for an emergency Caesarean at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital. She then had to be transferred to Hull Royal Infirmary as medics continued working on her. Colin added: 'I’m still in shock with it all, I can’t take it all on board. She was bleeding from her uterus and the surgeons couldn’t find the point of bleeding to stem it. 'It was like running a bath without the plug in. They couldn’t find where the bleeding was coming from so they just had to keep pumping blood in. 'Things weren’t looking good but eventually they used a seaweed serum which showed where the bleeding was coming from so they could stop it. 'The doctor told us she had never seen such a severe case of pre-eclampsia in her 35 years.' HELLP is a severe form of pre-eclampsia and stands for 'haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets'. Haemolysis . means that your blood cells start to break . down. Elevated liver enzymes means that your liver has become affected. Low platelets means that the number of platelets in your blood is low . and you are at risk of serious bleeding problems. The condition occurs in around one in 1,000 pregnancies. Symptoms . include fatigue, fluid retention, headaches, vomiting, blurry vision, . abdominal pain and sometimes bleeding that won't stop. The . main treatment is to deliver the baby immediately, even if premature, . as complications can harm both mother and child. Blood tranfusions may . be required. Women with a history of HELLP syndrome are considered at increased risk for complications in future pregnancies. Poh and Colin with baby Angolina, who was born two weeks early via caesarean section . After nine days in hospital for both mum and baby they have now returned home and are recovering well from their ordeal. And baby Angolina Natolia Pearl Parcell, who weighed in at 5lb 10oz, has arrived in time for the couple to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary. The family have thanked the staff at Hull Royal Infirmary and at the Women and Children’s Unit for their life-saving efforts. Painter and decorator Colin added: 'They have given my wife and baby a life that wasn’t going to be there. 'It’s also worth making pregnant ladies aware of just how easy this can happen because she had no problems throughout her pregnancy. 'I would say to anybody out there - any partners or family members of pregnant women - you need to be there in the last couple of weeks of pregnancy. 'This could happen to anybody and if I hadn’t been there they may not have been saved. This could happen to anybody people have to be careful.'","Mrs Parcell was struck down with Hellp Syndrome, a complication that affects one in 1,000 pregnancies .

Heart-rending: Clint Heichel, husband of Whitney Heichel, 21, broke down as he attempted to speak at a press conference on Thursday . Holt, who knew Heichel and her husband, was arrested after police found inconsistencies in the stories that he told investigators over the course of two interviews. Police said he is also tied to the crime by DNA evidence -- though they would not elaborate. A motive for the horrific crime in unknown. Police did not comment on whether they have a theory of what led to the killing. Accused: Police arrested Heichel's neighbor, Jonathan Holt, 24, after his stories to police didn't add up . The Starbucks barista reportedly left . her apartment for work at about 6.45am on Tuesday on a drive that . typically takes less than five minutes. Her husband, Clint, called police . roughly three hours later. He told investigators he tried to reach . Heichel multiple times after her boss alerted him that she never arrived . for her 7am shift. Police said Heichel's ATM card was . used at a nearby Troutdale gas station at 9.14am on Tuesday. Two hours . later, her sport utility vehicle was found in a Wal-Mart parking lot . with the passenger side window smashed. A child later found her cell phone in . a field that lies between the gas station and the Wal-Mart, giving . investigators another venue to search. Jim Vaughn, a family spokesman, spoke at the Friday night news conference, thanking police for their commitment in the case. 'Really, words can't begin to express the sadness that our families are experiencing tonight,' Vaughn said. He asked for privacy for the family. Police took no questions. At a press conference on Thursday, Heichel's husband sobbed uncontrollably and was hardly able to utter a word . as the missing woman’s mother begged for her daughter's safe return. 'It hurts to breathe right now,' Lorilei Ritmiller told reporters while . speaking of 21-year-old Whitney Heichel. 'But we just want to find her . and we're not going to stop.' Heichel . was reported missing by her husband, Clint Heichel, after she failed to . show for her 7am shift at a Starbucks in the Portland suburb of . Gresham. Just hours after Thursday’s emotional . press conference, children playing in an apartment complex several miles . away from Heichel’s home found what is believed to be the missing . woman’s cell phone. Parents of one of the children told . KATU that the device was spotted in bushes outside the Troutdale Terrace . Apartments on Thursday evening. The family said the phone had a . screensaver of a picture of Heichel and text messages from her relatives . asking if she was okay. 'I was pretty shocked. I mean I knew right away ... I recognized the face,' April Fletcher, the mother of one the girls, told ABC News. Search: A map of Gresham, Oregon shows the short distance between Heichel's home and her work, and the spot where he cell phone was found . The . apartment complex is about four miles away from Heichel's home in . Gresham. Gresham police said at the press conference on Thursday that they had interviewed the Troutdale gas station attendant where Heichel's ATM card was used at 9.14 am, examined surveillance video and canvassed the neighborhood where Heichel lives. Lt. Claudio Grandjean declined to say if Heichel was seen after 7am, or to say who may have been driving her SUV. Distraught: Sobbing Clint Heichel gets a hug from Lorilei Ritmiller, Whitney's mother, during a press conference on Thursday . Desperate plea: While Clint Heichel, left, was too overcome with emotion to speak to reporters, her mother, right, begged for the 21-year-old's safe return before her remains were found on Friday . Police said they recovered potential . evidence during searches of Dodge Park and Larch Mountain, remote, . forested places east of Gresham where they believe the SUV was on Tuesday . morning. 'There has been . property recovered at different locations, but we can't positively say . that that property is related to this,' Chief Junginger . said. Ritmiller said her . daughter's nickname within the family is 'Mama,' because she's always . been like a second mother to everybody, including her six siblings. Ritmiller . added that her daughter was a hard worker, a devoted Jehovah's Witness . with a 'heart as big as the sun,' and her greatest hope was to have . children of her own. 'She's wanted to be a mama since she was two years old and I brought her sister home,' she said. 'That was just her biggest hope, to have babies.' Grandjean said police received 25 phone tips on Wednesday and another 21 that night. Two dozen detectives were assigned to the case that had been classified as a suspicious disappearance. Though he acknowledged that the first 48 hours are very important in a missing-person case, he stressed that the case is far from cold. Tragic: Six hours after she left home, her car was found with a smashed window in a parking lot . Extensive search: Clint alerted authorities after Heichel failed to turn up for work on Tuesday in Gresham, Oregon . 'The leads and the evidence we've . gathered have not gone cold, and so we continue to push forward until we . find Whitney,' he on Thursday. Friends . said that a gas station attendant claimed that Heichel's vehicle, which was found with the window smashed in, had been driven . by a man, who was acting 'suspicious and hurried', as Heichel sat in the . passenger seat. Her husband, Clint Heichel, told Fox 12 that he learned of his wife's disappearance when her manager at Starbucks called to say she had not arrived for her shift. 'She got dressed this morning, normal everything. Kissed me goodbye, said goodbye,' he said on Tuesday. '(At) about 8:15 her boss called me and said, ""Hey, I was just curious, did . Whitney decide to be sick or not feeling well? Have you seen her or . talked to her?""' he told KATU. Mr Heichel tried calling and texting her, but she did not respond. Abandoned: Her black 1999 Ford Explorer was found in a WalMart parking lot four miles from her home with a window smashed. It looked as if it had been rummaged through, friends said . Targeted: Police confirmed that her SUV was seen at a gas station before the vehicle was found in a car park . Worried, he drove to her parents' home . and then to a hospital in the area, as well as calling family and . friends to see if anyone knew of her whereabouts. When they could provide no further . information, he called police to report her missing at 9.56am, and . friends and family began distributing flyers and searching for her. Detectives learned that her vehicle, a black 1999 Ford Explorer, was seen and her ATM card was used at a gas station around four miles from her home at 9.14am. Her . missing poster claimed an attendant said the man driving the car bought a small amount of gas, but police could not confirm this. At 1pm, family and friends looking for . Heichel found her vehicle, with the passenger window smashed, at a Walmart in Wood Village. Details: Family and friends had been handing out flyers in the area in the hopes of gathering information before her body was found . It appeared as if someone had rummaged through the car, according to her missing poster. 'The passenger side window was busted . out, the backseats were down, there was mud on her tires, which it . wasn't that way the night before,' Clint Heichel said. 'It just is weird that we found her truck, completely off the path that she would take to go to work.' He added: 'Anyone who has a loved one or is . married knows if your spouse goes missing and there's no word... I don't . know what to say, I don't know what to think, I don't know what to do.' In their investigation, Gresham police looked at surveillance . video showing the SUV at the gas station, but said the video was poor quality and detectives were unable to see who was driving the car. Family and friends conducted an extensive search for the young woman, including setting up Facebook groups.","Police arrest 24-year-old male neighbour over aggravated murder .

Holidaymakers face a flight price hike from next month as Air Passenger Duty soars by almost 10 per cent. The rise will see the tax on a family of four flying to Florida increase to £260 while a trip to Australia will now be hit by £368 in charges. Flights to Spain will also be hit by £52 levies. The sharp increase in air passenger duty - dubbed the 'poll tax of the skies' - will come into effect from April 1. Price hike: Air passenger duty will soar by almost 10 per cent from next month - adding £52 to the cost of a trip to Spain for a family of four . Airlines said George Osborne's tax grab will be a major blow to British tourism in the Olympic year as the levy is also paid on all flights into the country. The Chancellor was accused of burying bad news because the tax rise was not mentioned in his budget yesterday but appeared in papers released by the Treasury later. From April next year the owners of private aircraft will also have to pay the charge. Air passenger duty is banded according to the flight's destination. Holidaymakers travelling to Europe will pay £13 per ticket from next month, £65 if travelling to the U.S. and £92 for flights to Australia. While Air Passenger Duty stood at just £5 for a European flight in 2005 and £20 for all other destinations, from next month it will soar. The tax will now add £92 to the cost of flights to Australia - and £13 for a European destination. Britain has the highest air passenger duty in the world, and this table outlines how it will hit your flights. In 2005 the charge was just £5 on all European flights and £20 for all other destinations. The tax is expected to raise £2.6billion for the Treasury in the current financial year. The 8 per cent hike coming into effect next month takes into account inflation and a deferred increase from April 2011. Travel . industry leaders last night joined together to slam the move, claiming . the Government was 'squeezing the life out of the economy' with its . 'blinkered approach' to aviation tax.

'Yet again, the Treasury is pressing ahead with further rises without any analysis of their effect on the wider economy. 'In the absence of such a study, we . must assume that the Treasury knows it cannot justify this . job-destroying tax in overall economic terms. APD must be scrapped.' Mark Tanzer, chief executive of ABTA, the travel association, said the tax hike will stunt growth in tourism.

If a 22-year-old student informed the parents of his 11-year-old female cousin (albeit a distant one) that he had taken a shine to the preteen and planned to marry her, he would be met, in 2012, with a raised eyebrow - at the very least. And in 1852, when ambitious Cambridge undergraduate Edward Benson visited his relations in Bristol and did precisely that, little Mary 'Minnie' Sidgwick's mother was just as startled. 'As good as God, as clever as the Devil': The extraordinary Victorian life (and the secret female lovers) of the Archbishop of Canterbury's wife . But Edward was persistent, and Mrs Sidgwick, a widowed mother caring for three young children - one of whom, Mary, was beset with an unquenchable desire to please people - was powerless to resist. And so, just one year later, Edward sat 12-year-old Minnie on his knee and proposed. And because she knew it was the only thing he wanted to hear, she accepted. They married when she was 18. 'I realise that he chose me deliberately, as a child who was very fond of him and whom he might educate - he even wanted to preserve himself from errant fallings-in-love,' Mary wrote in her diaries adulthood. 'God, thou gavest me a nature which desired to please - and on its natural gaiety and pleasure-lovingness had been planted by my Mother a strong sense of duty.' More... Kerching! Fifty Shades Of Grey author is making more than $1m EVERY WEEK . Never trust a man who doesn’t shine his shoes: And other pearls of wisdom passed on by my tough-as-nails grandmother . HISTORICAL FICTION . From that day 'Mary's duty to her mother had been supplanted by duty to her husband', writes South African historian Rodney Bolt in his historical tome, The Impossible Life Of Mary Benson: The Extraordinary Story of a Victorian Wife, originally titled As Good As God, As Clever As The Devil. 'And Mary did her best to fulfil that duty.' Indeed, not only did Mary bear her difficult, obstinate, argumentative, depressive and often cruel intellectual spouse with six preternaturally gifted children - two of whom died in childhood, four of whom became published authors - but she also supported him through the meteoric rise of his career, a career which culminated in him being made Archbishop of Canterbury. And this is all particularly impressive when you learn that Mary was simultaneously juggling a hefty secret complication of her own: she was a lesbian. Family life: The Bensons at Wellington College, of which Mary's husband Edward was Master . Aged just 29, Edward became master of the Berkshire public school Wellington College, and he and his young family moved into a cottage on campus. All of the Benson children were intellectually brilliant - among them were poet Arthur Benson, who wrote the words to Land of Hope and Glory, and E. F. Benson, whose Mapp and Lucia books still enjoy a cult following today. Their gifts were nurtured by parents . who published a family magazine - with each family member making a . mandatory contribution of at least four pages per edition - and would . only allow bread to be passed down the dinner table if it was requested . in rhyming couplets. While her husband taught, Mary raised their six children and, dissatisfied with her role as a housewife, found solace in a long succession of infatuations and loving liaisons with women. 'Swarmings’, she called them in her detailed diaries. Some of them were unrequited, some 'a complete fusing', all of them were difficult for her, as a strict Christian and as a wife, to accept. Eventually she solved this dilemma by regarding her same-sex encounters as gifts from God. Coastal retreat: The Benson family at Lis Escop, Cornwall, in 1883 . Mary's romantic trysts included an intense bond with . Charlotte ‘Chat’ Basset, a vivacious middle-aged woman who had married . into a wealthy Cornish copper-mining family; Tan Mylne, the wife of a theological student she met when Edward became Chancellor of Lincoln Cathedral in 1873; and Emily, number 39, about whom she penned the line in her journal: ‘O that sweet time with Emily. How we drew together. Lord, it was Thou, teaching me how to love.’ Edward, meanwhile, was appointed Bishop of Truro in 1876, Archbishop of Canterbury in 1882. In London, living in Lambeth Palace, . Mary became the darling of a dazzling new social circle which included . literary figures such as Alfred Lord Tennyson, Robert Browning and Henry . James. Prime Minister William Gladstone even named her 'the cleverest woman in Europe'. Happy at last: Mary Benson aged 73, four years before her death . Mary also embarked on a four-year relationship with a young composer named Ethel Smyth who gave Mary her much-loved nickname 'Ben' but also complicated matters by forming a relationship with Mary's youngest daughter, Nellie. 'I feel that this time is emphatically Nellie’s and I do long for her to have it good,’ Mary wrote to Ethel, bowing out. ‘I think she is very happy now.’ In 1896 Edward Benson died of heart failure while praying, and Mary left Lambeth Palace, choosing to set up home near Haywards Heath, Sussex, with her girlfriend of six years, Lucy Tait. They lived there with Mary’s daughter Maggie and Maggie's own lesbian lover, Nettie Gourlay. When she reached her late 70s and had become an increasingly deaf, frail figure who described a walk around the garden with her as ‘a totter with a tortoise’, Mary she died peacefully in her sleep with Lucy Tait in bed beside her. Mourners at her funeral described Lucy only as ‘a family friend’.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 18:19 EST, 10 November 2011 . Their motto is 'Rollback' - and now it can be applied to times as well as prices. Wal-Mart plans to beat other U.S. retailers to the punch by starting 'Black Friday' on Thanksgiving night rather than wait until the wee hours of Friday for the traditional start of the high stakes holiday shopping season. Announcing its offers on November 10, as opposed to November 22 as it did last year, also prevents leaks about its deals from being revealed on the Web by someone else. Discount shoppers looking for Black Friday deals will get to start on Thanksgiving night at Wal-Mart stores, as the retail giant announced the holiday shopping frenzy will begin at 10 pm . While the holiday shopping season traditionally kicks off on the day after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday, the push to sell Christmas presents and other items has been moving earlier and earlier in recent years. 1000 Gap, Blue Navy, Banana Republic and Athletic stores will start Thanksgiving sales as the clock strikes 12 on Friday November 25, joining Macy's, Best Buy, Kohl's and Target. No rest: Employees of the world's largest retailer will have to report back early to attend to the discount shoppers . But Walmart held a special sale last Saturday to get a jump-start on the holiday season, while stores such as Staples Inc and Websites such as Amazon.com Inc and Toysrus.com have been offering specials this month. Target Corp said it does not plan to unveil its Black Friday deals until the day before Thanksgiving, when shoppers can see its advertisement online, but it has already had holiday-themed offers. Walmart, the world's largest retailer, said deals on toys, home items and clothing will begin at 10 p.m. on Thanksgiving, followed by electronics deals at midnight and other offers at 8 a.m. on Friday, November 25. After disappointing results, Walmart has vowed to match or beat competitors' prices as it tries to once again be seen as the destination for low prices. While many of its stores have been open on Thanksgiving before, in the past Walmart waited until Friday to push specific bargains. 'Our customers told us they would rather stay up late to shop than get up early,' Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising officer of Walmart U.S., said in a statement. Last year, the National Retail Foundation found the number of people who began their 'Black Friday' shopping at midnight had tripled to 9.5 percent of shoppers. Midnight bargains: Wal-Mart is getting a jump on retailers like Macy's, Kohl's, Best Buy and Target, which will all open at . midnight on Black Friday . While there are some big discounts on limited items at Walmart, some offers do not appear to be that enticing. For example, at 10 p.m. on Thanksgiving, a Microsoft Corp Xbox360 4GB with Kinect and a $50 Walmart gift card will sell for $199.96. The console -- without a gift card -- was priced at $299 on Walmart's website on Wednesday. An 8 GB Apple Inc iPod Touch will sell for $195 at midnight on November 25. But the same item was priced at $189 on Walmart.com on Wednesday after the chain lowered its online price to keep up with competitors. Walmart opened many of its U.S. stores on Thanksgiving Day in 2010 and kept them open overnight, a tactic it adopted after an employee was trampled to death on Black Friday in 2008. This year, most Walmart stores will be open on Thanksgiving, unless they are required to close by local and state law.","Stores were already planning to be open Thanksgiving .

Vanity Wonder spoke to Eamon Holmes and Ruth Langsford on This Morning today and admitted she was 'dumb' to go to extreme lengths to get a curvy posterior. After showing pictures where Vanity looked 'bootilicious' before having hundreds of the illegal injections, Ruth asked the 30-year-old why she had wanted to change her body shape. Regrets: Vanity Wonder appeared on This Morning to show Eamon Holmes and Ruth Langsford how injections and then silicone implants have left her with a disproportionately large bottom . Curvaceous: The 30-year-old told the amazed presenters she become obsessed with making her bum bigger when she worked as a dancer . 'This size was not my goal': Vanity said the illegal injections gave her an infection which meant she had to have silicone implants so her bottom didn't look lumpy . Vanity admitted it had become an obsession as she felt she had to compete against other women in her job as a dancer. She said: 'When I heard about butt injections I thought it sounded stupid but after a year in . that environment as a dancer, everyone was doing it, it wasn't such a . foreign concept. I thought I might as well try it. 'Then it became a competition - not for men but against other women. So . many of us were doing it because we wanted to better than the other . person.' Don't do it: Vanity wanted to share her story to warn other women against having illegal injections. She said she was lucky just to get an infection but other women have been killed as they didn't even know what they were being injected with . Vanity revealed each procedure involved at least nine injections in each cheek. She described how the injections felt like being struck by lightning and that they could often leak but this didn't deter her. She admitted after the first treatment she didn't even know what she had been injected with.  'The first time I went for injections I . didn't know what she used. She said it was soya bean oil but after . doing my research, I don't believe her,' she said. Vanity developed an infection as a result of the illegal injections but even this didn't make her stop having them. However, she explained it then meant she had to have silicone implants as the infection had left her bottom looking like 'a sack of oranges'. She explained: 'It did become addictive but it got infected so I was left with lumps. So I had a choice, I could have a medium-sized lumpy butt or keep padding it with silicone to . make it better. So it wasn't my goal to get this big but padding it . with silicone is how this happened.' Before: After seeing these pictures of Vanity before her injections, Ruth asked the mother-of-two why she wanted to change herself. She said it was thanks to competition with other women in her job as a dancer . Eamon asked Vanity to stand up from the This Morning sofa to reveal just how large her bottom is now.  'That's quite a curve,' he commented. Vanity . admitted she isn't happy with her size but she has learnt to live with . it because surgery to reverse it would be too risky.

Standing in the corridor of the This Morning studios, Vanity shows how the hip injections have also altered her body shape . These close-ups reveal just how dramatically her figure has been changed as a result of injections and implants . Vanity realises . that she has been one of the lucky ones after reading reports of women . dying who had been injected with Fix-A-Flat tyre sealant and even . cement.

And now she reveals that her winning wardrobe isn't down to a pricey celebrity stylist, or even an innate sense of knowing what looks good, it is in fact her own 'live-in wardrobe expert' her daughter Amber. Elegant: Annabel shows off her enviable style in a simple shift dress and leg-lengthening heels . As a presenter on French TV channel Eurosport watched by up to 20million people Annabel is expected to look chic at all times.

Amber, the eldest of Annabel’s three children has been keeping an eye on her mother’s wardrobe since being horrified by a pair of those 1990s court shoes aged 12. Yummy mummy: Annabel pictured with a young Amber, left, and her other two children Charlie, right and Lily in 2002 . On duty: Presenting for French channel Eurosport who have 20million viewers . By the age of 13 the pretty brunette, . who is the picture image of her tennis champ mother, was persuading her . to ditch the out of date styles and splash out on new looks. In the past Annabel has admitted she isn’t much of a fashion fiend saying: ‘I’m not very indulgent. I'd prefer to spend on my home than be extravagant on clothes’ But a little gentle persuasion from her fashionista daughter has helped Annabel learn how to put new looks together featuring pieces from modern, quality brands like Issa, Acne, J brand, Elizabeth and James and L K Bennett. Today Amber is responsible for most of Annabel’s working wardrobe choices, even styling up two weeks’ worth of outfits with pictures and notes for the presenter’s foreign work trips. And it’s working. On court: The tennis champ in action during a Ladies Invitation Doubles match at Wimbledon in 2010 . Annabel says: ‘Last year when I was presenting the US Open Tennis on Sky, one of the producers asked me: “Who do you use as a stylist? We keep getting emails about what you’re wearing – people love your wardrobe.” It was pretty funny replying: “Well, you’ll never believe this but it’s my 17-year-old daughter.” Reclaiming her wardrobe with the help of her eldest daughter has done wonders for Annabel’s confidence and she also claims it has helped her career. Amber says: ‘My mum used to be out of touch with fashion,  but I’ve made her more up to date. Once you’re over 40 you don’t want to be pushing boundaries too much but you want to feel nice. I call her my little dolly because I’m always dressing her up.'","New wardrobe filled with J Brand, Acne, Issa and L K Bennet .

A 'loutish' recruitment consultant who glassed a workmate in the face claiming his drink had slipped from his grasp was fined in court today. Archie Brooks, 21, attacked Olivia Parish in a City of London bar after the two had attended an afternoon meeting that included alcohol. After they had rowed Mr Brooks's glass struck his colleague in the face - but he insisted he had only meant to throw ice and drink at her. Ms Parish needed stitches for the cut to her lip after she was struck last March 30 and Brooks was sacked from his £32,000-a-year job. He was due to stand trial for assault occasioning actual bodily harm but prosecutors accepted a plea to a lesser charge of common assault before a jury was sworn in. He was handed a £1,000 fine and ordered to pay £250 compensation to his victim and £100 towards court costs. Judge Stephen Kramer QC told him: ‘You behaved drunkenly and loutishly and your conduct resulted in a nasty injury. ‘Those who behave in that way, in those sort of circumstances in this city can normally expect a custodial sentence.’ Both Brooks and Ms Parish worked for London-based Coal IT, and sat close to each other in the firm’s Jewry Street offices. They attended a boozy meeting on the day of the attack, before heading to The Abbey bar in nearby Minories with other workmates. ‘There was always banter between the two of them,’ said prosecutor Katrina Charles. ‘But on this occasion the language was abusive.’ Their exchanges culminated with Brooks’ tumbler glass striking the victim in the face, she added. When he was arrested he told police he had only intended to embarrass Ms Parish by throwing the remnants of his drink over her. ‘But that glass went flying from his hand,’ said Ms Charles. The attack happened at The Abbey Bar following a boozy meeting . Brooks pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of assault on that basis, she added. He lost his job, which offered bonuses of up to £8,000 for every transaction, after the attack and is in the process of setting up his own clothing firm, the court was told. The judge said Brooks’ age, guilty plea and good character meant he had avoided a more serious sentence. Brooks, of Redbridge, east London, denied assault occasioning actual bodily harm but admitted common assault.","Archie Brooks, 21, 'only meant to throw drink over female colleague' but his glass struck her in the face .

The Pope's butler has denied stealing private correspondence but admitted to betraying the trust of the pontiff, whom he said he loved like a son would his father. Paolo Gabriele's trial for aggravated theft began today in a Vatican courtroom, with prosecutors claiming he leaked details of power struggles and corruption from papal documents to a journalist. The 46-year-old has confessed to passing on information, triggering one of the most damaging scandals of Pope Benedict XVI's time in office. But he told the court today that he was 'innocent concerning the charge of aggravated theft' although he felt 'guilty of having betrayed the trust of the Holy Father, whom I love as a son would.' Scroll down for video . Papal problem: Pope Benedict XVI faced one of the most damaging scandals of his time in office after Paolo Gabriele, right in the Vatican courtroom, leaked information to a journalist . Gabriele also claims he was mistreated by police during his incarceration, and the judge has ordered prosecutors to investigate the allegations. He says he was kept in a tiny cell at the headquarters of the Pope's police force, with the lights on constantly, which he said contributed to his 'psychological depression.' He claims the cell he was kept in after his arrest was so narrow he . could not stretch out his arms. Father Federico Lombardi, the Vatican . spokesman, insisted that the size of the cell, and the conditions under . which Gabriele was held for just over two months, conformed to international . standards. Explosive revelations: Gabriele said he passed details of power struggles and corruption to journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi, pictured, to expose 'evil' within the Church . Vatican police arrested the father of three after . they found a stash of papal papers in his Vatican City home. In all, . police carted off 82 boxes of papers, though not all of them were papal . correspondence. Prosecutors have quoted him as saying that even . though he knew taking the documents was wrong, he felt inspired by the . Holy Spirit 'to bring the church back on the right track.' He apparently wanted to expose 'evil and corruption', adding: 'I was compelled also by my profound faith and desire that there should be light shed on everything in the church.' Today is the first time the public have heard from . the butler himself about the events that landed him in a Vatican . detention facility on May 23. The trial opened over the weekend in . an intimate ground-floor room in the Vatican's courthouse behind St. Peter's Basilica. On the opposite wall . from where he sat was a photo of Benedict, his boss, the victim of . the alleged crime, and the supreme judge in the case. As an absolute . monarch, Benedict has full judicial authority in the Vatican city state . and can intervene to stop a trial. He delegates that power to the . three-judge tribunal, but he can pardon Gabriele and most expect he will . if there is a conviction. Judge Giuseppe Della Torre has said he . expects the trial to be over in about four more hearings. Gabriele faces four . years in prison if convicted. The Pope's private secretary, Monsignor . Georg Gaenswein, said he began having suspicions about Gabriele after he . realised three documents that appeared in the journalist's book could . only have come from the office he shared with Gabriele. Other witnesses will include one of the four consecrated . women who care for the Pope's household, Cristina Cernetti. Her testimony could shed light on the deeply private world of the small . 'papal family' who live, eat and pray together with the 85-year-old leader of the Catholic church. The Pope's entourage returned to Rome on Monday after spending the summer in . the papal retreat of Castel Gandolfo. Gabriele has said he handed the . documentation to Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi, whose book 'His . Holiness: The secret papers of Pope Benedict XVI', was published to . great fanfare in May. 'Like father and son': Gabriele, right, at the start of the trial in the Vatican this weekend. He denies the charge of aggravated theft but says he feels he has 'betrayed' the Pope . An earlier Nuzzi book,'Vatican SpA,' was based on a . trove of damaging documents from the Vatican bank. 'His Holiness' contained dozens of . reprinted letters and memos: some showed how wealthy donors scored . audiences with the pope after handing over checks for 10,000 euros; . others detailed the questionable relationship between Italian and Holy . See politics, particularly concerning the tax-exempt status for . church-owned real estate. The most damaging letter reproduced in . the book was written by the former No. 2 Vatican administrator to the . pope, in which he begged not to be transferred as punishment for . exposing alleged corruption. The prelate, Monsignor Carlo Maria Vigano, . is now the Vatican's U.S. ambassador. 'Inhumane': President of the tribunal Giuseppe Dalla Torre (front right) has ordered the prosecution to investigate the claims of Gabriele (third left, in grey) that he was mistreated by police after his arrest . On the eve of Gabriele's testimony, . Nuzzi - who revealed his source after Gabriele confessed - said he hoped . the one-time butler would make clear why he betrayed the Pope and . risked so much to air the Vatican's dirty laundry. 'He did it because he saw through his . own eyes that there were plots, stories and accusations of corruption, . made by important monsignors, unclear relationships between states,' Nuzzi told Italian television TG5 on Monday.

"Keith Gray slimmed down from 17st to 10st by cutting out the junk food . Once ate Big Mac for breakfast now feasts on fish and vegetables . Saved £175 a week on weight loss programme . By .

Whether it's a little black dress you've been dying to slip on or the prospect of holidaying in a barely-there swimsuit, goals play a fundamental role in weight loss. But one man's light at the end of the weight loss tunnel was quite different to the norm. Keith Gray was such a Doctor Who fanatic that he used the £2,000 that he saved when dieting to build his very own Tardis. Dr Who fan Keith Gray spent £2,000 that he saved dieting on the Tardis, he lost 7 stone in the process . Keith once weighed 17 stone and would feast on takeaways for breakfast, now he has slimmed down and loves fish and vegetables . The 33-year-old from Dalston, East . London, paid for the life-size square blue police box by saving the . money he usually spent on junk food and now vows never to return to his . former seventeen stone self. The advertising and art director said: 'When I was a boy I used to leave a Tardis-sized space empty in my bedroom in case The Doctor landed. Now at last it feels like he has!' Keith asked his carpenter father Gordon to build the box, which now stands pride of place in his lounge and is used as an office. He added: 'I love the Time Lord but when I was overweight I never had the get up and go to do anything different. I’ve wanted a Tardis since I was a child and I’ve rewarded myself after losing the weight. 'Now, I can indulge my passion. I use it as my office and I can sit in there and work and write and it’s very relaxing. 'Some people spend their money on new clothes, or a holiday but I really wanted a Tardis.' Keith, who is 5ft 10in weighed almost 17 stone when he started on the Lighter Life weightloss programme last year. At 17st, Keith didn't feel happy and after standing on the scales he decided it was time to take action . Four months on he achieved his goal of 10 stone and his waistline slimmed down from 39 inches to 28. 'I hadn’t always been big but over the last few years the weight has crept on. 'Then one day last year I got a shock while buying some furniture in Ikea. For some reason I stepped onto a pair of scales in the bathroom section and couldn’t believe what I saw! I knew I had to do something,' he said. Keith, whose favourite Dr Who was Peter Davison who starred in the series in the early Eighties, was eating bacon sandwiches or Big Mac meals for breakfast, huge portions of pasta or pizza and snacking on chocolate and crisps in between. He uses the Tardis, that he has dreamed of having since he was young, as an office . He said: 'I was spending around £250 a week on food. I couldn’t just have dinner, I’d have to have lots of toast before I went to bed. I was eating all day without a break. 'LightLife cost me £75 a week so I was saving around £175 a week which I put into a pot for my Tardis. 'Now I eat porridge for breakfast, steamed fish or chicken with rice and pasta and lots of fruit. 'If I ever feel tempted I look at my Tardis and remember that the old Keith probably wouldn’t have fitted into it!'","Keith Gray slimmed down from 17st to 10st by cutting out the junk food .

Scroll down for video . Julia Roberts looks far younger than her 44 years in the new Lancome fragrance advert . Roberts has been an ambassador for Lancôme since 2010 but this is her first fragrance campaign with the French beauty company. A campaign she did for the brand last year was banned by the Advertising Standards Authority, who deemed L'Oreal, parent company of Lancome, had used digitally retouched images that could 'mislead' the viewer. L’Oreal said at the time that image had been digitally re-touched to ‘lighten the skin, clean up make-up, reduce dark shadows and shading around the eyes, smooth the lips and darken the eyebrows’. However, again, it insisted that the image was an accurate reflection of the benefits of the product. The ASA was not convinced, ruling the images could not be used again in their current form. Here though, it cannot be denied that Julia Roberts is in possession of a striking natural beauty. Dressed in a floor length white dress that reveals her ample cleavage, the star shines in her role.

The . perfume itself is made of just 63 subtle ingredients and was the . creation of three French masters of perfumery; Olivier Polge, Dominique . Ropion and Anne Flipo, who aimed to create 'the first ever feminine . iris'. The perfume has fruity flavour notes of blackcurrant and pear, with tones of tonka bean, praline, patchouli and vanilla. The Pretty Woman actress told Hello! magazine that it's important for her to wear a nice scent as it makes her feel more confident with herself. 'I like to smell nice.

Fashion fanatic: Before the tragic plane accident last December, Lauren often visited New York Fashion Week and was building up her own fashion blog . 'Lo’s physical pain has subsided a great deal. It is now the emotional pain that is the tough one,' Mrs Scruggs wrote. The next hurdle for the burgeoning fashion blogger and model is the decision whether or not to be fitted with a prosthetic arm. 'We again met with the arm people this week. Again, another step,' Mrs Scruggs wrote Thursday. More details continue to emerge about the December 3 accident as the emergency 911 call was released in late January. 'A girl walked into an airplane prop - I need an ambulance immediately,' the female caller tells the 911 operator in the seven-minute recording obtained by TMZ.com. 'I think it cut her hand off.' In the call, placed at 8.48pm from the private airport near Dallas, the male caller described the model as conscious and breathing but bleeding badly with her face to the ground. Family: Lauren Scruggs pictured with her father, mother and twin sister - who was suffering 'sympathy pains' When asked exactly what part of her body she injured, the male caller says: 'We don’t know, we haven't turned her over.' Her cries and moans became louder throughout the call. Witnesses thought that Lauren must have been crossing in front of the plane to go thank the pilot Curt Richmond, who was trying to warn her to avoid the propeller. Mr Richmond put down his arm and turned away from her when he thought she had turned to walk away from the spinning propeller, according to a National Transportation Safety Board report. But it's unclear whether she heard his warning over the roar of the engine. Moments later, someone on the ground screamed 'Stop! Stop!' and Mr Richmond saw her lying on the tarmac and he immediately cut the engine. Pilot: Curt Richmond, right, told investigators that he tried to warn Ms Scruggs about the danger of the propeller . Plane: The pilot's warning may have been lost in the roar of the engine, with tragic consequences . Mr Richmond, believed to be a friend of Lauren's, had left the engine running while new passengers filed into the small plane as he prepared another trip to the skies. The NTSB did not find fault with the pilot for the accident but air safety investigator Denny Kelly said Mr Richmond is ultimately responsible because he 'should have shut the engine down'. 'I don’t know how to thank each one of you, properly, for so much love during this difficult incident in my life,' Ms Scruggs wrote in January. 'My heart is so grateful beyond what I could ever imagine. 'Thank you dearly for the sweet encouragements, the precious words in letters and messages, the beautiful grace in pretty presents. 'But mostly I am so so thankful for you and your loving hearts and sweet spirits.'","Lauren Scruggs spent 'fun weekend with sweet family and friends'

An insensitive customer ignored a man who lay dying metres away from him so that he could order a glass of wine, an inquest heard today. Chartered surveyor Peter Westropp was killed by a falling lump of masonry as he sat drinking with friends outside a restaurant in Battersea, southwest London. The 27-year-old and his friends had just moved table when blocks of stone crashed down outside Le Bouchon Bordelais, with one hitting him on the head and knocking him unconscious. But as Mr Westropp lay dying under the fallen debris, just four days before his 28th birthday, one selfish man carried on ordering drinks just metres from the commotion. Tragic: Chartered surveyor Peter Westropp, 27, was killed when falling masonry shattered his skull as he shared a drink with friends . Ms Kripena said: 'A customer asked me what happened and I said the masonry has collapsed and someone was seriously hurt or dead. 'Another guy who was with him wanted to . order another glass of wine. I screamed at him ""Are you mad? Can’t you . see what has happened? We are closed"".' The dedicated Arsenal fan died soon afterwards having suffered devastating head injuries. The waitress went to a back room in the bar to get a tablecloth to place over Mr Westropp’s body. The inquest was also told by the bistro's manager said that around three months before the death, a driver lost control of her car and crashed into the building. Mr Naick M’Bae, the restaurant's duty manager on the night Mr Westropp died, said: 'I can remember one significant incident leading up to this incident, where damage was caused to the front of the building. 'Approximately three months before this incident a car driven by a woman lost control and ran into the restaurant hitting the wall between units five and seven. 'This caused damage to the patio window and the partition wall between units seven and nine.' The manager said he had also spotted youths jumping on the restaurant’s boundary wall just four days before Mr Westropp’s death . He said: 'The only other incident I can recall was a number of youths jumped between the boundary terrace wall. Heartbroken: Peter Westropp's parents John Westropp, left, and Marion Westropp, right, from Shortlands, Bromley, arriving at the inquest into their son's death in August last year . 'They were climbing onto the wall and jumpng on the side of the terrace. 'The canopy was up and they were jumping on the wall and jumping down. It was high jinx.' Several shops and businesses have been damaged in the days before Peter’s death as widespread rioting swept through the capital in August last year. Le Bouchon closed on Monday and Tuesday evening due to the riots, but had reopened on the Wednesday, the night Peter died. Both Mr M’Bae and Ms Kripena told the inquest they were unaware of any damage to the bar during the riots. His father John Westropp told Westminster Coroner’s Court that friends and family are still coming to terms with the tragedy. He said: 'Peter has left a gaping hole in our lives and is sadly missed by so many. ‘What has shone through all this is that throughout his tragically short life, Peter made countless friends. ‘He loved socialising, sometimes a bit too much, and I think he influenced many people’s lives for the better. ‘We know from talking to his age group that they were all severely shocked by his death.' Mr Westropp had recently moved to Battersea from his family home in Bromley, Kent. He was with friends at the bar in Battersea Rise when the incident happened, at around 9.15pm, on August 10 last year. They finished dinner across the road and headed to Le Bouchon where Peter Westropp bought the first pitcher of beer. The scene: Westropp was sitting outside French restaurant and bar, Le Bouchon Bordelais, on Battersea Rise in Battersea, south London, when he was hit by a stone slab . Friend Harry Pope said: ‘We had been sat there for about 15 minutes when we heard a noise. ‘There was no warning, it was very sudden. ‘It was falling masonry from the building and it hit Peter on the head. ‘When . it happened, there was obviously quite a commotion inside the bar and . around the tables, with everyone trying to see what had happened. ‘Peter clearly wasn’t OK, and at that point I was overcome by emotion.’ Mr Westropp was immediately knocked unconscious and had a large wound on his head. Police were called to the scene amid fears that the incident might have been riot related. PC Steven Hayles said told the court: ‘I was told friends had been sitting with Peter at a table when suddenly a block of masonry came down and hit him, and he was knocked unconscious immediately. ‘It had come from above the restaurant sign, by a window of the flats.’ Following his death, around 650 packed out a church for his funeral, and friends and family have continued to pay tribute to his life in the year since. John Westropp told the hearing: ‘He was an ardent Arsenal fan, attended as many games home and away as possible. ‘Thanks to friends, he will be remembered by a plaque in the new memorial floor at the stadium.’ A memorial trust has been set up in his honour since his death, with the inaugural fund raising dinner held last month raising £18,000 for charity. ‘The trust will raise funds for the Carers Trust, which Peter would have needed no doubt is he survived the tragic accident’, said Mr Westropp. Peter was born in Islington, but his family moved to Bromley two years later. He graduated from Leeds University with a BA in Geography in 2002 before gaining a masters in real estate management from Oxford Brookes University. He had worked at leading London property consultancy firm Gerald Eve since 2007, and was dating a Irish woman called Ellie at the time. His father said he loved going on ski trips with friends and had travelled the world in a gap year, visiting every continent except for Antarctica. Peter had been living with his parents in Shortlands, Bromley, before moving to Battersea. The inquest into the cause of his death, which is due to last five days, continues.","Peter Westropp, 27, was hit on the head in Battersea, southwest London .

Dolphins are being trained for military action by the Ukraine navy in a return to Soviet-style underwater warfare, it emerged yesterday. The marine mammals will be taught to attack enemy combat swimmers using special knives or pistols fixed to their heads, said a source in Sevastopol, a large port on the Black Sea. They are also able to locate items of military interest and mark them by attaching buoys, or plant explosives in enemy territory.

'Ten dolphins are now being trained for special tasks in the Ukrainian State Oceanarium,' the source revealed. 'The Ukrainian military are regularly training the animals for detecting things on the seabed.' In Soviet times, dolphins were used to locate mines on the seabed and attack divers. They could carry explosives on their heads to plant them on enemy ships. It is unclear why Ukraine feels the need to restore the 'unit' of naval dolphins in the Black Sea. Fascinating creatures: Russian Misha Stepanov, who has cerebral palsy, plays with dolphin Anita during a therapy course at a medical centre in Kazachya Bay, Sevastopol . Unusually, it shares the famous port of Sevastopol with the Russian Navy. Several exercises have been carried out this year both in an aquarium and on the open sea. 'The missions were successfully carried out,' said the naval source. 'Our dolphins found the items and attached devices to them which were fixed on their heads, after which a buoy on it was sent to the surface to mark it.' The former top secret military base on the Crimean peninsula became a leading place for dolphin-therapy - a controversial alternative technique to soothe ailments - after the Soviet collapse. Dolphins who previously were engaged in military service turned their highly trained minds away from office to helping cure children with a range of problems from nightmares to autism to cerebral palsy. The U.S. Navy trained dolphins for military use in Virginia as part of its Marine Mammal Program. It is important that handlers are able to bond with the marine mammals and examine them for any heath issues.","The sea creatures previously worked to blow up enemy ships for military and find lost items .

Fruit and vegetable prices have soared by 50 per cent plus in the past year after the wettest summer in a century devastated crops. A snapshot survey of fresh produce costs reveals some startling increases, and supermarkets are warning of more to come. Grain prices are also surging because harvests both in the UK and abroad have been hit, which will put up the cost of bread and pasta. Expensive: Fruit and veg prices have doubled in the past year after the wet summer ruined crops . It has already led to dramatic increases in the cost of animal feed and this will have a knock-on effect on the price of milk, chicken, eggs, pork and bacon. The survey by the shopping and price comparison website MySupermarket.co.uk found that at Asda a 2.5kg pack of Maris Piper Potatoes has doubled in price from £1 to £2 since October 2011, while a pack of British Gala apples is up 70 per cent to £1.70. At Tesco, a kilo of loose carrots is up 50 per cent to 90p, while a 400g pack of cauliflower and broccoli florets is up 25 per cent to £1.25. Sainsbury’s has put up the price of its Conference pears by 39 per cent to around 39p each, while its loose Royal Gala apples are 19 per cent more. The Essentials range at Waitrose is designed for shoppers on a budget, but a 1kg pack of carrots is up 55 per cent in a year to 90p, while pointed spring cabbage has risen by 35 per cent to 80p. The price increases mean that many people are not buying the fresh produce they need for a healthy diet . The price rises mean many people are not buying the fresh produce they need for a healthy diet. The poorest 10 per cent of households are buying 25 per cent less fruit than in 2007, while their  vegetable consumption has fallen by 15 per cent, according to a  study published by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.Tim Lang, professor of food policy at London’s City University, said the surge in the price of fresh produce is ‘a disaster for public health’. The British Retail Consortium, which speaks for the major supermarkets, insists its members are protecting customers against the worst effect of rising prices. Its food director, Andrew Opie, said: ‘Retailers are doing a lot to keep fruit and veg affordable, from running record numbers of promotions to putting more produce into their basic ranges.’ But bosses at Tesco and Sainsbury’s have warned of shortages of home-produced fruit and vegetables and higher prices in the run-up to Christmas. The problems for British farmers relate to the torrential rain during the summer months and more recently, which have left many fields waterlogged. The national potato harvest could be the lowest in 35 years, while the apple crop is down by around 25 per cent. Farmers are also highlighting the fact that Britain’s wheat harvest has fallen by around 15 per cent this year on the five-year average, with productivity down to 1980s levels. While the problem in the UK has been too much rain, in the US and Russia droughts have hit wheat, soya, corn and other grains, pushing up the price of animal feed. Poor harvests will affect the price of animal feed, which will push up the cost of meat . The National Farmers’ Union has . suggested that some members will pull out of chicken and pig production . because the rise in feed costs mean they cannot make it pay. Its president, Peter Kendall, said: ‘It’s been soul-destroying for the farmers growing the crops.’ He added: ‘The challenge for the pig and poultry market is to make sure retailers pay a fair price, because in pigs 50 per cent of the cost is grain, poultry it’s 60 per cent. ‘These farmers at the moment, because the prices haven’t responded yet, they’re saying I’m not going to fill my sheds with poultry or pigs any more.’ The extent of the washout is starkly illustrated by the decision of one of England’s leading wine producers to abandon its harvest. The wettest summer in England and Wales for 100 years means  that for the first time since it planted its first vines in 1988, Nyetimber has decided its grapes are not worth collecting. Sussex-based Nyetimber, which makes wines, has decided its grapes aren't worth collecting . Sparkling wines made by Nyetimber, which is based at West Chiltington in West Sussex, are popular with the Royal Family. The 2007 Classic Cuvee was the only sparkling wine served on the Royal Barge during the Diamond Jubilee pageant on the Thames and was also served at the Diamond Jubilee lunch at Westminster Hall. Winemaker Cherie Spriggs said: ‘My first obligation is to ensure the quality of Nyetimber’s wines, and we have decided that the grapes from 2012 cannot deliver the standards we have achieved in the past and will again in the future.’","Prices up after wettest summer in a century ruined crops .

Modelling her Team GB kit earlier this year, triathlete Hollie Avil appeared to be in peak physical condition. But she shook the sports world when she announced she was ending her career – revealing that she was suffering from an overpowering eating disorder. Single-minded: Triathlete Hollie Avil, pictured on the Serpentine, was one of Britain's top triathletes before her eating disorder forced her to give up the sport . Now the 22-year-old has revealed the . full extent of her battle with food, admitting perfectionism caused her . to be ‘her own worst enemy’. She said her five-year struggle with weight loss stemmed from an off-the-cuff comment by a coach. She explained: ‘When I was 16 I . competed at the Junior World Championships, coming 11 out of 80 girls. I . was really chuffed but my coach said, “Swimming won’t make you faster . Hollie, losing weight will make you run faster. You need to watch that . weight of yours”. ‘I was shocked,’ she went on. ‘Nobody . had ever mentioned my weight before and I didn’t think there was . anything wrong with it  – but I instantly took it to heart. ‘In the weeks that followed I weighed . myself constantly and cut down my food. I didn’t for a moment realise . that what I was doing was abnormal.’ Troubled: The 22-year-old would watch recordings of races to compare her shape to that of her competitors . ‘I was my own worst enemy. I trained at the weekend with senior athletes and I would look at what they were eating. ‘I’d notice they wouldn’t have butter . on their bread and would only eat salad. I thought, “Well if they’re . doing it, I should too”.’ The coach’s comment saw the teenager drastically reduce her calorie intake. While female athletes typically . require around 3,000 calories a day, Hollie cut her meals down to only . porridge, made with water rather than milk, a whole lettuce and a cereal . bar. But her high-powered three-hour daily workout would leave her feeling weak. She told Grazia magazine: ‘My training . definitely suffered because of my diet. In swimming I was so thin I’d . get too cold in the water. I also struggled to float as I didn’t have . the buoyancy. But I was addicted to not eating and kept getting thinner . and thinner.’ After winning the Junior European . Championships in 2007, she began to think that eating less was the key . to her success. But then the disease began to eat away at her. She was tired and agitated and . suffered from repeated colds and illnesses. She only realised that she . needed help after her parents saw her bony spine protruding from her . kit. Painfully self-conscious: Left, at the Beijing Olympics and right, with Kirsty McWilliam after winning the Junior European Triathlon Championships in Copenhagen . She was persuaded to see a . nutritionist, but it wasn’t until she suffered stress fractures that she . decided to abandon her 2012 dreams last month. Although she has described the . decision as heartbreaking, Hollie now says she is relieved to have . escaped the pressure of top level sport before  she did permanent damage . to her health. Between 2006 and 2007, she dropped . more than a stone before her trainer Ben Bright realised that she had a . problem and pushed her towards recovery. He discussed the disorder with her parents and showed her statistics that proved she was faster when heavier. Her condition improved and in 2007 and . 2008 a series of wins meant that she was ranked world number one in the . triathalon – a multi-sport discipline involving swimming, cycling and . running. But an unrelated illness wrecked her hopes for the Beijing Olympics and she suffered a recurrence in 2010. Stress fractures, probably caused by . her reduced bone density, and the pressure of London 2012, caused her . final spin into self-doubt, leading to her retirement.

An argument on live Greek TV turned violent after an extreme far-right Holocaust denier assaulted two left-wing deputies during a morning political show. Ilias Kasidiaris, spokesman for Golden Dawn, threw a glass of water at Rena Dorou, a member of the radical left Syriza party, when she made a reference to a court case pending against him. He then turned on Liana Kanelli, a prominent Communist party member, and punched her several times about the head. Scroll down for the video . One of Ilias Kasidiaris's punches lands on Liana Kanelli's face after she threw pieces of paper at him for hurling a glass of water at another politician . Former MP Elias Kassidiaris (second left) rains punches down on Liana Kanelli as TV host Giorgos Papadakis tries to help her . The fracas broke out on the private Antenna TV station during a political discussion ahead of Greece's repeat elections on June 17. Kasidiaris, 31, bounded out of his seat and hurled a glass of water across the table over Ms Dorou when she said there was a 'crisis of democracy when people who will take the country back 500 years have got into the Greek parliament'. Ilias Kasidiaris is a former MP for the Golden Dawn political party . He then turned on prominent Communist . Party member Liana Kanelli, who had got out of her chair with a . newspaper in hand and appeared to throw it at the Golden Dawn member. Talk show host Giorgos Papadakis ran over to Kasidiaris to attempt to calm him, shouting 'no, no, no', but Kasidiaris, who served in the Greek military's special forces, hit Ms Kanelli around the face three times. Kasidiaris was elected to parliament in the country's recent inconclusive polls. Deputies from all seven parties that won parliament seats in the May 6 polls had been invited on the show. A public prosecutor ordered his immediate arrest for the attacks. Government spokesman Dimitris Tsiodras said: 'The government condemns in the most categorical way the attack by Golden Dawn spokesman Ilias Kasidiaris against Liana Kanelli and Rena Dourou. This attack is an attack against every democratic citizen.' Mr Tsiodras called on Golden Dawn to condemn its member's actions. Golden Dawn, which vehemently denies the neo-Nazi label, has been accused of being behind violent attacks against immigrants. Just before the attack, Kasidiaris had thrown water at Rena Dourou who made a reference to an impending trial . The party won nearly 7 per cent of the vote on May 6, giving it 21 seats in the 300-member parliament. It was a radical increase from its showing in the previous elections in 2009, when the party won just 0.31 per cent of the vote. Greeks reeling from two years of austerity amid their country's vicious financial crisis punished the two formerly main parties, the conservative New Democracy and socialist PASOK at the polls, turning instead to radical smaller parties to the right and left of the political spectrum. The 300 deputies took up their seats for a day last month before parliament was dissolved and new elections called as no party had won enough votes to form a government on its own, and negotiations for a coalition government collapsed after 10 days.","Far right spokesman punched Communist party member several times in the head .

But 12-year-old Declan Hind ended up costing his father £7,000 after being lured into the world of online poker. The schoolboy, already a poker expert from playing the game on free smartphone ‘apps’ with his friends, could not resist the temptation to play for real stakes. Addiction: Keith Hind with his son Declan who spent £7,000 on gambling websites . Armed with his father Keith’s credit card details, he quickly lost hundreds of pounds. And his efforts to recoup the money before he was caught only saw his losses snowball. Now the family have joined  forces . with a child protection  charity to raise awareness of how young people . can fall victim to online gambling. Figures last year suggested that as . many as 60,000 children are problem gamblers. Experts say young people . are encouraged by free online games to enjoy gambling, only to find . themselves sucked into the real thing. Declan, of Maghull, Merseyside, had . borrowed his father’s credit card to buy his mother a birthday card from . the Moonpig website. Once online, he succumbed to . temptation and went on an unconnected poker site, simply saying that he . was over 18 to  start gambling. He said yesterday: ‘It started off in school. My mate got into the poker games, it was free to download, we were all doing it. ‘It was all virtual money but I  got . really good at it, I was making loads. I went on to one of the poker . websites and put all the information in. ‘I started making a bit, but not as much as I was losing.’ Desperate to win back the money he had . lost on his father’s card, Declan carried on playing, digging himself . even deeper into a hole. Addictive: Declan is now volunteering for a charity so he can warn other families about the dangers of underage gambling . He was too ashamed to admit what he . had done even when his father, a 52-year-old lorry driver, found out to . his shock that his credit limit had been exceeded and his card was . blocked. Mr Hind said yesterday: ‘I was screaming and shouting at the credit card company, I didn’t know what had happened.’ Declan, now 13, kept quiet for a week, . wiping all the online games off the home computer in an effort to cover . his tracks before he finally confessed. ‘I was mad, really livid, for . weeks, but I was also shocked,’ said Mr Hind. ‘It was so easy for him to . do it.’ As no fraud had taken place, Mr Hind had to pay the bill . himself, which totalled £7,000 including interest. Now he is working with child . protection charity Prevention Town to produce information packs for . school and raise awareness of the pitfalls of online gambling. Charity director Ross Carroll said: . ‘Parents need to be aware of what their children are doing online, and . these sites also have a responsibility to carry out proper checks that . gamblers are over 18.’ Controversially, Mr Hind is organising a charity poker tournament in Monaco to raise money to support Prevention Town.

Farmer's fury: David Gould has hit out at his neighbour Alan Jackson who shot dead his collie Poppy but was cleared by a court of trespassing on his land . A dairy farmer whose collie dog was shot dead by his neighbour 'Bang Bang Jack' has spoken of his fury after the gunman was cleared of wrongdoing. David Gould, 49, was milking his cows when sheep farmer Alan Jackson came into his garden and fired at his dog Poppy with a shotgun. Mr Gould ran to help his black and white dog but she died outside his farmhouse in Henbury, Cheshire, before he could summon help a court heard. Police arrested Mr Jackson, 51, who claimed he had earlier seen Poppy attacking one of his ewes and decided to shoot the dog dead to protect his flock. It was claimed pellets from Mr Jackson’s gun had also smashed a window and become embedded in Mr Gould’s wallpaper. At Macclesfield magistrates court, Mr Jackson was cleared of trespassing with a shotgun. Chairman of the bench Brian Titford said: 'This has been a difficult case with many grey areas. It’s not in dispute you were in land in possession of a shotgun and you found a dead sheep with the dog in the vicinity. 'You had strayed from a public footpath thus trespassing. However given the lead up you had reasonable excuse.' Today Mr Gould, a tenant at the farm for 11 years, said: 'I’m just so disappointed with the verdict and it just sends out a message for people to go onto other people’s property armed with a shotgun and shoot their animals. 'I don’t believe for one minute my Poppy mauled that sheep. She could not have had the physical strength to drag a ewe down by its throat. Poppy wasn’t a big dog and she did not kill that ewe.' He added: 'Poppy was not only my pet dog but my best friend and she has been by my side for seven years. We were virtually inseparable. 'Yet he just went out of his way to shoot her without telling me what happened first. He didn’t have to kill her. 'My frustration is that only two people know what happened - me and him. It’s difficult because it’s one word against another.' The incident occurred on November 18 last year when Mr Gould, who lived alone, was in his milking parlour and heard two shots outside. He left the parlour to see gunsmoke, his dog lying dead on the lawn, and Mr Jackson stood at the end of a silage clamp. Shot dead: Poppy who was killed after she allegedly mauled a sheep - a claim her owner Alan Jackson denied . Shooting: David Gould's farmhouse in Macclesfield, Cheshire, where his dog was shot dead by his trespassing neighbour Alan Jackson . He said: 'It was about 8am and I heard two loud blasts - I thought something had exploded in the house but when I ran outside I saw the gun smoke and smelled the cordite. 'I looked up and saw someone walking away with a shotgun - and there was Poppy lying flat near the fence. I thought, what the hell is she lying like that for? It was as if she was asleep. Damage: A smashed window at David Gould's farm which he claims was broken when his dog was killed . 'I went up and then I realised she was dead - I couldn’t believe it. 'I did see Poppy in the field earlier but think she was just sniffing the ewe - which I think had been dead for a while. She certainly wasn’t killing the animal. 'If she had been viciously attacking the ewe she would have been a mess -she would have had blood round her mouth and fleece stuck to her - but there wasn’t any. 'I asked him what he was doing carrying a loaded shotgun and he said he always does. 'Even if my dog had done this. I said I would have paid him back twice over but he said: ""they all say that"". It was as if he didn’t give a damn. 'If there had been an Alsatian on my land and I followed it to the nearest residential area and shot it in someone’s garden, I’m sure I would be locked in jail straight away. I feel like the one being punished here. I miss Poppy so much.' Mr Jackson, of Old Parks Farm, Gawsworth, told the court he saw the dog attacking the sheep as he drove past the field in his Land Rover and resorted to shooting the hound to protect his flock - which the law allows farmers to do. He said he opened fire on the dog whilst it was in the field then followed and shot it once more to 'finish it off” as the injured animal struggled up a bank on Mr Gould’s land. In court his lawyer Gwn Lewis said: . 'Mr Jackson didn’t take any pleasure from this. He followed the dog and . despatched it to stop it killing his sheep and to stop its pain.” Mr Jackson himself said: 'I could see the dog on the sheep and the first thing I did was shoot it between the shoulder and ear. 'I was always led to believe a dog could be shot after worrying livestock - especially on my land. 'At . the end of the day, it’s over with and I just want to draw a line under . it. I’m a commercial sheep farmer, I am not proud of it, we have an . on-going problem with losing sheep because of dogs attacking - the most . we lost at one time was 31.'

Ploy: Visa will disable 27 LINK cash machines and replace them with just eight Visa only cashpoints . Olympics sponsor Visa has been accused of exploiting spectators by effectively banning the use of rival cards at Games venues. It is ordering the closure of all cashpoints which accept Mastercard or American Express. Non-Visa customers will not even be able to use their cards to pay for goods at checkouts. The card giant will disable 27 LINK machines inside venues and replace them with just eight Visa-only cashpoints. These will be found at the Olympic Park in East London and the Excel centre in nearby Docklands, leaving 34 venues – including Wembley Stadium – with no cashpoints at all. Critics say this will entice spectators to apply for Visa cards and encourage even existing customers to pay by card for food, drinks and merchandise, boosting the company’s income from transaction fees incurred whenever a purchase is made. Visa has also been accused of using the ban as a cynical ploy to promote its new ‘contactless’ payment cards, which will be accepted at the venues. These allow shoppers to make payments of up to £15 by simply swiping the card at a till. Visa is a top-tier sponsor of London 2012 and has exclusive rights over the Games’ payment system. Marc Gander, of the Consumer Action Group, predicted long queues at cashpoints outside venues. He said: ‘This is shocking. It is a privilege to be a sponsor of the Olympics and they are abusing that privilege by exploiting consumers. ‘Non-Visa customers will be angry and concerned by this kind of discrimination. Where are we heading with this? Will we cover up manhole covers with Thames Water on them because it is not a sponsor? This should be a joyous event and instead it is being marshalled in a controlled and rather sinister “1984” manner.’ Critics have said the Visa removing cashpoints around the Olympic park is a cynical scheme to make more from credit card transaction fees . UK Payments Council director Ron Delnevo called Visa ‘power-crazed’. He said: ‘The Olympics do not belong to any sponsor, however much money they have paid. McDonald’s is a sponsor but it is not forcing everyone to eat only hamburgers. ‘This is plainly unacceptable in a world where 85 per cent plus of all transactions continue to be made using cash. ‘The Games are meant to be a celebration of the sporting prowess of men and women from every corner of our planet. ‘Sadly, it seems that the ideals of the Olympics now take a back seat whenever they get in the way of needs of commercial sponsors.’ He added that he believed the move was a shameless way of Visa promoting its new contactless cards, which he said had proved unpopular in the UK because of security concerns. ‘The vast majority of people attending the Games, from over 200 countries, have no interest in becoming guinea pigs in product launches by sponsors,’ he said. The disabling of cashpoints by Visa means that some Olympic venues, including Wembley Stadium, will have no cashpoints at all . Visa said: ‘At every Olympic Games, Visa creates and manages the entire payment system infrastructure and network throughout all Olympic Games venues. ‘Eight ATMs will be installed at London 2012 Olympic venues and this year, for the first time at an Olympic and Paralympic Games, contactless payment technology will be implemented across the event venues providing additional ways to pay. ‘Visa debit, credit and prepaid cards and cash will be accepted at all venues.’ A spokesman added that more than 115million Visa cards were in circulation in the UK and the majority of UK banks issue Visa debit cards.","Card giant to disable cashpoints around Olympic venues so customers only use Visa .

Mr Ryder said: 'I’m not fond of snakes at all, I didn’t even like my Grandma’s snake draught excluder. 'I enjoy running around Swinsty and I have been wondering how to get my speed up - I don’t have to worry now.' He said he spotted the snake at about 6pm on Saturday. It is believed to be an abandoned pet. Mr Ryder, who runs Biskit Marketing, in Otley, West Yorkshire, thought it was a very big adder but experts from the Yorkshire Naturalists Union confirmed it was a boa constrictor, measuring around 6ft (1.8m). Geoff Lomas, site manager for Yorkshire Water, said: 'Over the years, we’ve discovered a number of escaped or unwanted exotic pets at our recreational sites across the region, such as terrapins and koi carp, but never an exotic snake more commonly found in the jungles of South America. 'Clearly there is some concern in that we have a snake, of which we know very little, including when it last ate, on the loose in a vast woodland area which is very popular with visitors from across the region. 'Whilst a boa constrictor is unlikely to pose a risk to humans, a lot of people walk their dogs around the site and clearly small dogs could be at a small risk from such a predator. 'With this in mind, we’re saying to people, please do come to the site, but please be sensible and exercise caution when out and about, ensuring all dogs are kept on a lead. 'If you do spot the snake, please let us, the police or the RSPCA know as quickly as possible, and every attempt will be made to safely capture the snake and hopefully return it to its owner.' Boa constrictors can grow to 12ft (3.7m) long and normally hunt in the dark. Young boa constrictors need to be fed once a week but older snakes can go without food for up to a month. The experts have told Yorkshire Water the reptiles need high temperatures and it may be too cold for it to survive at Swinsty. Remain calm, like Ken and Buffy... unless you're a dog .

Mitchell Elliott - former pub landlord and rogue trader who killed himself while awaiting fraud trial - pictured in 2010 facing trial for sexual assault . A businessman was found hanged at his home as he was due to stand trial for nine counts of fraud after being exposed on BBC’s Watchdog. Mitchell Elliott, 40, from Gloucester faced trial for fraud and deception after his appearance on the show had led to an investigation into his TV-aerial and satellite business. A coroners inquest heard how further complaints in the aftermath of the Rogue Traders episode, aired in 2009, destroyed the business and drove him into depression and drink. Mr Elliott had previously been given a two year suspended jail-term for forcing himself on a woman’s foot. The incident occurred when he was the landlord of the Bugatti Inn pub in Gloustershire. He was convicted of sexual assault in 2010 and after the attack became common knowledge trade disappeared and he was forced to sell the pub at a loss. After a suicide attempt in 2011 his GP requested a psychiatric evaluation which concluded that he would not attempt to take his own life because of his children. Elliott faced nine charges of dishonestly making false representations between November 17, 2009 and September 27, 2010, committed before his trial for sexual assault. The BBC Rogue Traders show exposed his fraudulent business as they carried out unnecessary work and charged customers for products they did not need. When the presenters posed as complaining . customers, Mitchell Elliott, who was the director of both companies . under investigation by the show, was taped making . threatening remarks before carrying on saying presenter Matt Allwright . should hang up ‘for his own sake’. Mitchell Elliott's fraudulent ways and bad customer service was exposed by Watchdog's Rogue Traders presenters Dan Penteado and Matt Allwright in 2009 which led to the decline of his businesses . As presenters asked for him by name he claimed that 'Mitchell Elliott' was killed in 2007, and that his name was Mark Jones, secretary of a new company that has taken over the dissolved Aerial Problems Solved Ltd. When contacted by a local paper after the BBC expose he claimed he had been abroad and had not had anything to do with the company since 2008. At the inquest, Deputy Assistant Gloucestershire Coroner Katy Skerrett heard Mr Elliott was found by his mother and a family friend on October 17 last year after members of his family had been unable to contact him for two days. Patrick Beanes, a family friend, and his mother Pauline, went to his house which was locked with a security chain. Mr Beanes said: ‘I broke in and saw Mitchell hanging from the bannisters.' Mr Elliott’s GP Stephen Steinhart said he had suffered from low mood and depression in 2010 - a reaction to his declining business. ‘He had thoughts as to whether life was worth living but said he would not harm himself,' ‘He was then admitted to hospital after taking an overdose of drink and pills. His business went into liquidation in August 2011 and there was another impending court case.’ The toxicology report concluded that he had one and a half times the drink drive limit of alcohol, and had used cocaine not long before his death, although police found nothing suspicious in his Gloucester home. Gloucester Country Council Trading Standards investigated Mr Elliott in 2009 but has been unable to comments.

The body of Maureen Wood, 63, was only discovered after an electricity firm sent an officer to force entry to cut off the supply because she had not paid her bill. Shocked neighbours said Ms Wood was such a recluse that they had thought the home was empty. A spokesman for Age UK today described the case as a 'real tragedy' that illustrates the problem of social isolation among the elderly. Tragedy: Maureen Wood, 63, was found dead in an armchair at her Burnley home (pictured centre) last October. She could have died at least ten months earlier . E.ON had been chasing Ms Wood over unpaid bills at her home in Burnley, Lancashire, since January last year, an inquest was told. Coroners officer PC Bob Wilson told the hearing that the company, after receiving no response to requests for payment, presumed the property was empty. On October 20 last year a warrant officer was sent to cut off the supply in the house. Burnley Council had confirmed to police that Ms Wood had lived at the property since 1993 and was in receipt of single occupancy discount on her council tax since. Officers spoke to neighbours who said that she had no family that they knew of and that she was a very private person who was rarely seen. None of those spoken to could remember when they had last seen her. Ms Wood had also been expected to attend an outpatient appointment at Royal Blackburn Hospital in June 2011 but had not attended. Dr Walid Salman, a consultant pathologist at Burnley General Hospital, said that Ms Wood could have been dead for ‘many months’. He said her cause of death was heart disease. Burnley town centre: The local council confirmed to police that Ms Wood had lived at her home since 1993 and paid council tax . Neighbour Jayne Simpson, 64, said: 'It was quite a shock to everybody on the street. 'I think everybody nearby thought the house was empty. You never saw anybody there. People said the lady who lived there was very quiet and didn’t seem to be out very often. 'Nobody thought anything of it when it went quiet. I think people thought she had moved or they hadn’t seen her for a while.' Geraldine Moore, chief officer at Age UK Lancashire, described the case as a ‘real tragedy’. She said: 'Social isolation is one of the big issues we deal with. We would urge everyone to take the time to check on older relatives and neighbours.' East Lancashire coroner Richard Taylor, recording a verdict of natural causes, said that Ms Wood had ‘potentially been dead since January’ because no-one had been able to make contact with her for the ten months leading up to the discovery of her body.","Body of Maureen Wood was found in her Burnley, Lancashire, home last October .

Another layer: Danil (right) claims he could not have been having an affair with Armando because he is straight and was married to an American woman named Victoria (left) Vindictive: Danil's brother Ivan (left) says that the whole case arose because Danil broke up with Victoria (right) and she was upset so she made up the claims and reported them to the police . Danil Lyapin and his mother claimed they had married for love but after a trial both have now been found guilty. A spokesman for the U.S. District . Attorney’s Office for Eastern Virginia said: ‘The defendant’s (Danil . Lyapin) conduct during the investigation far exceeded most of the other . approximately 120 offenders the government has prosecuted over the past . five years. ‘This defendant was the only one to enter into three distinct marriage frauds. ‘This defendant was particularly hard on his spouses and his girlfriends who were smart enough not to marry him. ‘This defendant made fraudulent filings and set up a fraudulent marriage with his mother.’ Out of character: Friends of Natallia, who had a job as a Russian teacher at a local high school, say she is a very honest person and she never would have made up a marriage . Neither Mr Figuero, who is originally from the Phillipines, or Victoria Lyapin have been charged. In a statement to WTKR, she said: ‘Those who know me and care for me know what the truth is. ‘Those who don’t, I’m unconcerned what they think they know about me. ‘Until they have walked a mile in my . shoes they cannot begin to know anything about me and my life. Do what . you feel is best. I have certainly in my life, in every aspect of it.’ Another casualty of the plot is Danil . Lyapin’s younger brother Ivan who is currently living in the US but now . faces being deported back to Belarus. Asked if he thought his mother’s marriage was fake, he said: ‘No, 100 percent. Armando is my family’. He added that he wanted to join the . military but now faces being sent home to a country he had not been to . for 10 years with no family and no money.

"By . Rachel Quigley . UPDATED: . 00:22 EST, 21 July 2011 . A Florida teenager told a friend that he stood behind his mother for about five minutes in contemplation before finally plunging a hammer into her head, according to police documents released on Wednesday. Police said Tyler Hadley, 17, described the attacks to an unidentified friend at the party he threw in his Port St Lucie home last Saturday night after the killings. By the friend's account, when Hadley struck his mother with the hammer, she screamed one final question to her son: 'Why?' Scroll down for video . Appearance: Hadley appeared via video link from county jail in front of a judge at the courthouse who denied him bail . Parents: Mary Jo and Blake Hadley who were bludgeoned to death in their homes by a hammer and hidden in a room while their son had a party . When his father walked into the room, . Hadley told the friend that they locked eyes before he started beating . his father with the hammer, too. The boy took his parents' cell phones . away ahead of the attack so they couldn't call for help, according to . his friend's account. When it was over, and the parents . were dead, Hadley spent three hours cleaning up the blood, before . hosting dozens of friends while the bodies were hidden inside a bedroom. Hadley told the friend he was surprised how . long the clean-up took. Hadley is charged with murder in the . deaths of Blake and Mary-Jo Hadley and is being held without bond. His . public defender, Mark Harllee, entered a written not guilty plea on his . client's behalf on Wednesday, but said he couldn't comment further. Best friend: Michael Mandell claims Hadley confessed to the crimes and told him he was possessed by the devil and had taken three ecstasy tablets . 'We're still looking at all the facts and all the paperwork,' he said. It was reported yesterday Hadley confessed to a friend he was possessed by the devil and had taken three ecstasy tablets . before the murders. The teenager allegedly told Michael Mandell that he did it because of a . combination of rap music, constant fights with his parents and the fact . they had financial problems. There have been no suggestions as to what his motive may have been for the brutal murders until now. Speaking to Treasure Coast . Newspapers, Michael, who lives only a few doors away from the Hadleys . and said he has known the 17-year-old his whole life, recounts the . moment Hadley confessed to the crimes. Normality: This picture was taken of Michael and Hadley at the party on Saturday night when he had already killed his parents . He said: 'He asked me to stay there . until after everyone left to see them and I didn't want to. I went in . there and checked for myself. 'I opened the door. I saw bloody . sheets piled everywhere. I saw broken pictures with blood on them and I . looked down and I saw his dad's leg there.' Michael said that Hadley also told him that the 'devil had possessed him' and said if he was caught he would commit suicide. He also said he believed drugs was the motive. 'I feel like this kid that I've known . all my life, I don't know him. His family was my family,' Michael said. 'They were very good people. I . really don't see any motive besides drugs. 'He took three ecstasy pills before he did this. He said he couldn't do it sober. Family: Hadley's mother Mary-Jo and father Blake were found beaten to death with a hammer, which was lying between their bodies . Hadley, seen here in his booking photo, has been charged as an adult for the killings . 'After he told me, I didn't believe him because he's been my best friend forever. I would never suspect anything like this. 'I was looking around, he told me if I look enough I could see signs. I looked on the floor and could see signs of blood.' Authorities believe Hadley killed his parents with a 22-inch framing hammer before . using books, files and towels to cover their bodies after he sent out . the Facebook invitation to the party earlier that day. Micahel said that he was 'having a fun time at the party and acting as if everything was normal'. He even took a photo with his best friend, saying he thought it would be the last time they would see each other. Scene: Hadley allegedly killed his parents before hosting a party at the family home . The police came to the Hadley home at 4.20am on Sunday morning after they received a tip off. Michael said it was not him who called police as he was 'too shocked' and 'just felt sick'. Morgan . Noel, Michael's girlfriend, said: 'I remember him making a weird . statement like a couple months ago, that the devil has possessed him, . and he was going crazy.' Hadley will not face the death . penalty due to the fact he is a minor despite the fact he has been tried . on two counts of first-degree murder as an adult. He is likely to serve a maximum sentence of life in prison if found guilty. Chief Assistant State Attorney Tom Bakkedahl said: 'It’s simply off the table, it’s not a viable option. Clues: Port St Lucie Police crime scene investigators collect evidence from the Hadley home on Sunday after the bodies were found . Weapon: Police issued a picture of a hammer similar to the one they believed was used to kill the Hadleys . 'Despite . the fact that the case may otherwise in all respects warrant the death . penalty, we are prohibited from seeking it as a result of Hadley being . approximately six months short of his 18th birthday.' Hadley . was wearing a sleeveless black jail uniform as he appeared via video . conference from the St Lucie County Jail in front of a judge at the . courthouse. He spoke only . three times during the hearing - once when he was asked to confirm his . name, then to answer whether or not he had an attorney and when asked if . he had any questions when told he was denied bail. Medical examiners are continuing to carry out tests on the bodies throughout today and tomorrow. State attorney Bakkedahl . said the injuries suffered by the two victims, suggest the killings were . premeditated or committed during an angry rage. He . said: 'In my personal opinion, any time you have a murder, you have . some degree or rage, so that is really meaningless to me, but it’s . certainly significant. I mean it’s just incredible, the injuries.' The party went on from around 9pm to 3am and the police arrived after an anonymous tip off around 4.20am. Hadley had been 'nervous and panicky,' they said and there were beer cans strewn all over the garden. He initially told police his parents were out of town. Police then found the bodies of Mr and Mrs Hadley in the master bedroom where the door had been locked. Mrs Hadley, 47, is believed to have been killed first and then Mr Hadley, 54, afterwards. They were not, authorities believe, killed in the bedroom where their bodies were found. While is not clear what the motive for . the alleged killing was, a resident told WSVN News he had heard Hadley's . parents had refused to let the teen have a party. Similarly . one of the teens attending the party said to WOKV that the 17-year-old . killed his parents because they 'wouldn't let him throw a party.' The teen had dropped out of his high . school and the family was being sued for $15,000 after Hadley hit and . injured a child while driving a car registered to his father in June . 2010, according to court documents. Hadley has been arrested and charged with two counts of first-degree murder. 'I've known Mary-Jo since she was in high school in Fort Lauderdale,' family friend Charlene Moses told WPTV. 'They are a nice family. The kids are always nice.' Tyler reportedly has an older brother who recently moved out the house. Blake Hadley was an employee of Florida Power & Light Co. and wife Mary Jo worked for 24 years as an elementary school teacher with the St. Lucie County School District.","Unidentified friend told police mother screamed one final question as he bludgeoned her to death .

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused Tehran of carrying out the bomb attack which killed six Israeli tourists at a Bulgarian airport earlier today and promised in a statement today that there would be an Israeli response. The bomb exploded outside the airport at the Black Sea resort of Burgas  on a double-decker . bus which was filled with tourists who had just . arrived on a charter flight from Israel. Witnesses told Israeli media that the blast, which injured at least 30 people, occurred soon after someone boarded the vehicle. Scroll down for video .

The explosion coincided with the 18th anniversary of an Iranian suicide bomb which killed 85 people at a Jewish organisation in Argentina. ‘We heard a very strong blast. The bus . was full with people and children. Flesh and blood everywhere,' a . Bulgarian witness told local television. ‘I saw another bus catching fire . from the one that exploded. It was complete chaos.’ According to . witnesses the bus was destroyed in the blast and body parts were strewn . on the tarmac outside the airport as clouds of dense black smoke . billowed above it.

Aid: A Bulgarian medic is helping an unidentified young Israeli tourists at a local hospital after the explosion which killed six people . Aviva Malka who was on board the bus . when the bomb exploded said: ‘We sat down and within a few seconds we . heard a huge boom and we ran away. 'We managed to escape through a hole . on the bus.’ The Interior Ministry declined to . comment on whether it might have been a suicide attack, as some . witnesses had speculated, and said it was questioning people who had . been close to the blast to get a clearer idea of what happened. The blast comes on the 18th . anniversary of a 1994 bomb attack on the headquarters of Argentina's . main Jewish organisation by an Iranian-backed Hezbollah suicide bomber, . which killed 85 people. In his statement Benjamin Netanyahu . said: ‘Eighteen years exactly after the blast at the Jewish community . centre in Argentina, murderous Iranian terror continues to hit innocent . people.

The incident was not reported by Iranian media and there was no immediate Iranian reaction to the Israeli accusation. Israeli diplomats have been targeted in several countries in recent months by bombers who Israel said struck on behalf of Iran.

A popular herbal remedy used by thousands of people to ward off Alzheimer’s is a waste of time, warn researchers. Taking ginkgo biloba supplements does not protect against developing the disease despite its reputation for improving memory and concentration. One of the longest and most rigorous studies ever conducted on ginkgo biloba found no proof that it helped to prevent the disease among older people starting to have memory problems. Users have been told to take between 60 and 240mg a day to reap the benefits of this herb . Doctors claim this is the final nail in the coffin for the Chinese remedy, following other trials that have found no benefit. Around 820,000 Britons are affected by . dementia with symptoms such as memory loss, confusion and mood changes, . with Alzheimer’s the most common cause. Many people with Alzheimer’s as well . as those concerned about becoming affected take gingko, derived from the . leaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree. The latest study by French researchers looked at whether the supplements could prevent the disease taking hold. The trial took place over five years, . involving 2854 people who were 70 years old or over, and who had asked . their family doctor about memory problems. Altogether . 1406 patients were given a twice daily dose of 120mg ginkgo biloba . extract, and 1414 given a placebo, designed to have a similar taste and . appearance to the ginkgo pills. Researchers used standard tests at regular intervals to assess the patients’ memory, brain function and dementia status. After . five years, 61 (four per cent) of those taking ginkgo had been . diagnosed with probable Alzheimer’s disease, compared with 73 (five per . cent) participants in the placebo group. The . difference was not statistically significant, and the researchers also . found no significant difference between the groups in the number who had . died or had a stroke, says a report in the medical journal The Lancet . Neurology. The study appears to confirm similar findings of a 2009 trial in the USA. Lead author Professor Bruno Vellas of the Hôpital Casselardit, in Toulouse, France, said it was the largest ever Alzheimer’s prevention study carried out in Europe. As one of the big retirement destinations for middle class Americans, Phoenix, Arizona has also become a capital of dementia care, as Louis Theroux found out . He said ‘Our trial was unique in that . the study population was made up of more than 2,500 individuals aged 70 . years and older, who were free of dementia, and who had spontaneously . reported subjective memory complaints. ‘While . our trial appears to have shown that regular use of ginkgo biloba does . not protect elderly patients from progression to Alzheimer’s disease, . more studies are needed on long term exposure. ‘The . fact that prevalence of this debilitating disorder is expected to . quadruple by 2050 suggests that research into preventative therapies for . this disease needs to receive urgent attention’ he added. Professor Lon Schneider, director of the University of Southern California’s (USC) Alzheimer’s Disease Research and Clinical Center, said in a comment in the journal: ‘If ginkgo biloba were a drug, and not marketed as a food supplement, clinical testing for efficacy against Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive impairment would have ended long ago.’ He said it would be ‘unfortunate’ if people taking gingko continued to believe it could work. ‘Some users will rationalise that, in the absence of effective treatments, ginkgo biloba could still possibly help and, appearing safe, will not harm them. Other users of ginkgo biloba, however, might now consider letting it go’ he added. Ginkgo biloba is extracted from the leaves of the Ginkgo - the world¿s oldest living tree . Ginkgo biloba is extracted from the leaves of the Ginkgo - the world’s oldest living tree - which was left only in China after the Ice Age. It contains three groups of complex . compounds called flavonoids, diterpines and sesquiterpines which are . thought to increase blood flow and improve circulation. Other . possible benefits , it is claimed, come from ginkgo’s antioxidant . activity, reducing the level of harmful chemicals in the body, and . increasing the oxygen and nutrient supply to the central nervous system. A . spokesman for the Alzheimer’s Society charity said ‘It is . understandable that people would want to hear that an over-the-counter . herbal remedy could be the answer to preventing Alzheimer’s. ‘For a while it was hoped that ginkgo biloba could be the wonder drug. ‘However, in recent years evidence - including a previous study by Alzheimer’s Society - has repeatedly shown that it does not have any benefits in preventing the disease or slowing down symptoms. ‘One in three people over 65 will develop dementia. The best way for people to reduce their risk is to eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, not smoke and keep their cholesterol levels in check.","French researchers looked at whether the supplements prevent the disease taking hold .

Michael Winner has revealed he may choose to take his own life at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland. The film director and restaurant critic, 76, said he has researched services at the assisted-dying institution. Earlier this year he revealed that liver specialists had told him he has 18 months to live. Decision: Michael Winner has said he may go to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland to end his life . He talked about his research into assisted suicide in a newspaper interview – before telling his wife. He said: ‘I checked Dignitas on the computer and you need to go through so much. It’s not a walk-in death. 'You don’t just go in and say “Here I am, do your worst”. ‘You have to go through a whole series of papers and re-examinations just to die. 'You have to fill in forms and things and you have to fly there, go back twice.’ He . said his wife Geraldine, who he married last year after first meeting . her 55 years ago, ‘would be shocked to know I’m even talking about it’. Married: Michael Winner and his bride Geraldine Lynton-Edwards. The couple married last year after first meeting 55 years ago. He said he would be 'shocked to know I'm even talking about it' More than 150 Britons have travelled to Switzerland to end their lives since the clinic opened. Winner, whose films include the Death Wish series, has struggled with ill-health since eating a bad oyster on holiday in Barbados in 2007. He was almost killed by the bacteria Vibrio vulnificus. He was on the brink of death five . times and underwent a gruelling 19 operations, one of which removed his . Achilles tendon, leaving him with mobility difficulties. But he insisted he was not frightened of death and believes he should be able to end his own life. ‘I think the idea that people should be able to have an assisted suicide is absolutely, highly proper,’ he said. Abroad: The Dignitas clinic in Switzerland, where Mr Winner may decide to die . ‘Why should people elongate life when it’s no good for them? 'People should have the right to terminate their own life. I’m very happy to snuff it. I’ve had enough time on Earth. Dignitas was founded in 1998 by Ludwig A. Minelli, a Swiss lawyer. Swiss laws provide that assistance to suicide is only illegal if it is motivated by self-interest. The person who wishes to die meets several Dignitas personnel, in addition to an independent doctor, for a private consultation. The independent doctor assesses the evidence provided by the patient and is met on two separate occasions, with a time gap between each of the consultations. Finally, a few minutes before the lethal overdose is provided, the person is once again reminded that taking the overdose will surely kill them. Dignitas assisted well over 1000 people to commit suicide, since 1998 . More than 150 Britons are believed to be among that number . Some 85 per cent of clients come from outside Switzerland . The largest groups, by nationality, are German, then British, then French . 'I’d be happy if someone gave me the plug to pull.’ Winner first met his wife in 1957 when she was an aspiring 16-year-old actress and ballet dancer and he a 21-year-old film-maker. They began dating after she auditioned for a role in his first film. However, they split after several months and she moved to France, where she married and had three children, while he moved to Hollywood when his film career took off. It was during this time that Mr Winner claimed he enjoyed 40 lovers every year, admitting he was ‘grossly unfaithful’. His numerous girlfriends have included actress Jenny Seagrove, whom he was with from 1987 to 1994. He dated ex-Benny Hill girl Lorraine Doyle between 1984 and 1986 and also actress Vanessa Perry, who is 30 years his junior, for five years until 1999. He always claimed he never wanted to marry, blaming his reluctance on a ‘mental deficiency’. In 2005, he rekindled his romance with Miss Lynton-Edwards and asked her to move into his palatial London home. However, shortly afterwards, he evicted her and took up with his secretary, Paola Lombard, 39. The affair only lasted a number of weeks and he and Miss Lynton-Edwards got back together soon after.","The film director said he has researched services at the Swiss clinic .

Frankie Cappuccini – affectionately nicknamed Mrs Coffee by her pupils – suffered heavy bleeding after her baby was born on Tuesday. Although she found the strength to spend a few hours nursing her son, Jack, she died of a cardiac arrest in Pembury Hospital, in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, soon after. Jack, who weighed 7lb 15oz when he was born, is said to be doing well and has been given the middle name Frankie after his mother. Mrs Cappuccini, 30, leaves her husband Tom, 32, their three-year-old son, Luca, and Jack. Mr Cappuccini wrote to well-wishers on his wife’s Facebook page: ‘Thank you all for your thoughts and prayers. ‘I love you so much Frankie. RIP. Your husband. Tom xxxx.’ Staff at Offham Primary School, near West Malling, Kent, were described as ‘shell shocked’ and decided to close the school on Wednesday to help children come to terms with Mrs Cappuccini’s death. Parents of the school’s 200 pupils received an email explaining what had happened to the Year One teacher, whose pupils were aged between five and six. Head teacher Phillip Hunter said: ‘Frankie did her teacher training with us nine years ago and stayed on afterwards. ‘She was a bubbly, enthusiastic and positive person and on top of all a brilliant teacher. She was a friend and a colleague to us. Moving: A book of condolence opened in her memory shows the depth of feeling felt by her pupils towards her . Message: Flowers left in the local church show how keenly the community has felt her death . Shut: The small Offham primary is closed today because of Frankie's death . ‘The community is shattered to learn . of her death and the school was closed on Wednesday as our community . came to terms with the news.’ Mr Hunter said Kent County Council’s . education psychology team had visited the school when it was closed to . advise teachers on bereavement support. The school is planning a memorial service for Mrs Cappuccini in the near future. A book of condolence was opened at . nearby St Michael’s Church and tearful villagers left flowers and . personal messages throughout the day. Parent Paula Botha, whose son Troy was . taught by Mrs Cappuccini, said: ‘It is such a tragedy for this to . happen, and to such a wonderful person just makes it feel so much more . of a tragedy. ‘She was an amazing teacher and an . amazing individual and we are all going to miss her very much – her . family, the schoolchildren, fellow teachers, parents and friends.’ One . friend and former work colleague said: ‘She was the most wonderful . person and teacher – beautiful inside and out. Sad: A tiny angel has been placed above Frankie's photo - surrounded by many lit candles . Paying their respects: (L-R) Milli Egglesden, Sarah Egglesden and Charlie Brown light candles at nearby St Michael's Church . Tributes: Flowers have been left near the altar all with moving messages to the primary school teacher . ‘I can’t express enough how selfless, . thoughtful and kind Frankie was, what an amazing teacher she was and how . much of a loss this is.’ Offham Primary School has now reopened . and a note asks for flowers to be taken to St Michael’s Church rather . than being left at the gates. Kent County Council area education officer David Adams said: ‘Frances was a much-loved teacher and will be greatly missed. ‘Our thoughts are with her family, friends and the school community.’ A statement on the school’s website . said: ‘Our thoughts are with her family at this time.’  The number of . Caesarean sections has doubled in Britain since 1990 and they now . account for a quarter of all births. That figure compares with the 1950s, when only around 3 per cent of babies were delivered by Caesarean sections. The NHS relaxed its guidelines last year making it easier for more mothers to have babies by C-section. But new statistics show that one in ten women develop infections after undergoing the procedure. The number of women dying in childbirth is up - mainly because of rising numbers of older new mums, expert research has found. A study into this issue by the Lancet this year showed that in London alone it has doubled in five years - twice the level found in the rest of the UK. Doctors say this is caused by more women being obese, older and also growing numbers using fertility treatment to get pregnant. Junior doctors have also been blamed for not knowing the limit of their experience and also senior medics have not been supervising them properly, a separate study said. Prof Cathy Warwick, general secretary of the Royal College of Midwives, told the Telegraph: 'Across the country, two factors are combining: maternity services are under pressure from a steadily rising birth rate while dealing with far more women with complex pregnancies.' She said trends in London were mirrored elsewhere in Britain, particularly in urban areas. The Lancet said maternal deaths in the capital rose from fewer than 10 deaths per 100,000 maternities in 2005/2006 to 20 deaths per 100,000 in 2010/2011. The average in the UK outside London of 8.6 fatalities per 100,000 births. There were 31  London deaths in total 10-11, with the total reducing to 22 in 11-12.","Frankie Cappuccini, who taught in Kent, died after her child was delivered by Caesarean section on Tuesday .

They may look like mythical unicorns, but these brilliant white steeds are in fact beautiful stallions from Austria's world famous riding school. Lipizzaner horses were bred for their outstanding qualities as carriage horses, but their incredible light-footed gait and acrobatic talent make them perfect for shows. Vienna's finest steeds showed off their talents at a fundraising gala in the Spanish Riding School's splendid baroque hall, where glamorous guests watch the breathtaking visual spectacle, which has been nurtured over 430 years. Sheer beauty: The Spanish Riding School's stallions are famous across the world for their astonishing talent . Classic elegance: Lipizzaner stallions are considered uniquely noble, spirited, willing and suited for the largely forgotten art of classical horsemanship . The School is not only the oldest riding academy in the world, it is also the only one where the High School of Classical Horsemanship still flourishes. The Lipizzaner stallions are descendants of 16th-century horses from the Iberian Peninsula, who were considered especially noble, spirited, willing and suited for the art of classical horsemanship. They are a cross between Spanish, Arabian and Berber horses and delight horse lovers from all over the world with their performances. In 1729, Emperor Charles VI commissioned the architect Josef Emanuel Fischer von Erlach to build the magnificent Winter Riding School in the Hofburg Palace. A portrait of the monarch graces the walls where the riders train their Lipizzaner stallions and show off their skills to an international audience during the public performances. Breathtaking sight: Guests at the fundraising gala are able to enjoy some of the last remaining steeds trained in the High School of Classical Horsemanship . Splendid achievement: It takes around six years for a stallion to be ready to take part in the School and only very few master the jaw-dropping leaps - the elevated 'Schools above the Ground' The Spanish Riding School is still wholly owned by the Austrian Federation and is charged with fulfilling certain duties for public benefit. These include the continuation of the traditional breeding of Lipizzaners, the rearing and provision of prime stallions for the Spanish Riding School and the preservation of the High School of Classical Horsemanship. At four years old, the stallions leave their birthplace in the Austrian town of Piber and travel to Vienna to be trained. The strong, intelligent animals are begin with elementary field schooling, when they are ridden in a natural posture in straight lines. The secondary field schooling, the following year, involves the horse being ridden in all gaits, turns and circles before the rider brings the horse to perfection. Stallions learn the piaffe, the passage, pirouettes and to change legs in the canter. It takes around six years for a stallion to be ready to take part in the School. Only very few, particularly talented and sensitive stallions master the jaw-dropping leaps - the elevated 'Schools above the Ground'.","Their impressive talents have been nurtured over 430 years at Vienna riding school .

Retired military officials could be barred from meeting ministers and officials after a group were caught boasting they could use old Whitehall contacts to secure deals for arms companies. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the ‘top brass for hire’ scandal was ‘deeply damaging to the individuals and their reputations’. ‘There are many reasons why it is sensible for the MoD to maintain contact with retired officers,’ Mr Hammond said. Allegations: Former military chiefs including ex-head of the Army Lord Dannatt (left) and Admiral Sir Trevor Soar (right, with Prince Andrew) are reported to have boasted about lobbying top officials to secure contracts for private firms in breach of Whitehall rules . ‘But if they are abusing that access . for commercial purposes then we will have to tighten it up or maybe even . shut it down. That is something we will now look at.’ He insisted: ‘There is no way retired officers influence the way military equipment is procured.’ Six ex-senior officers were secretly . filmed discussing how to influence ministers and ex-colleagues, claiming . they could help set up multi-million-pound deals for firms wanting to . sell equipment to British Forces. The revelations have shone fresh light on the revolving door between the Ministry of Defence and private weapons companies. The former commanders spoke to . undercover reporters posing as representatives of a South Korean firm . eager to sell unmanned drones. One – Admiral Sir Trevor Soar – was . still within the two-year period when personnel leaving office are . barred from working in the private sector. The ban ensures retired . military officers do not exploit ‘privileged access or sensitive . information’. Those caught on camera were Royal . British Legion president Lieutenant-General Sir John Kiszely; former MoD . procurement chief Lt Gen Richard Applegate; Sir Trevor, until this year . commander-in-chief of the Royal Navy; ex-Army chief General Lord . Dannatt; Lord Stirrup, the ex-head of the Armed Forces; and General Sir . Mike Jackson, another former head of the Army. All denied any . wrong-doing. Embarrassing: Sir John Kiszley, left, was caught on camera boasting of his influence, but Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, right, insisted the retired personnel wielded 'no influence' over procurement . Lord Dannatt, who retired three years . ago, met undercover reporters in his grace-and-favour apartment in the . Tower of London. The 61-year-old was offered what he called a . ‘reasonable’ £100,000 fee for two days’ work a month. He claimed he . would target senior mandarin Jon Thompson, his old school friend, over a . £400million deal to manage the MoD’s sprawling estate. Sir John, who advises defence firm . Babcock International, boasted about lobbying for a £4.3million deal to . take over MoD properties during the ‘purdah’ period – under which firms . are barred from lobbying. He bragged he could raise issues with the Prime Minister and other high-ranking figures at Remembrance Day events. The Legion has launched an investigation and Sir John faces losing his post. He has denied speaking about Babcock. Sir Trevor told undercover reporters . he had ‘to be slightly careful of lobbying ministers’ but would . ‘basically ignore [the rules]’. He said yesterday his private jobs had . been officially approved and he was motivated by bringing . ‘battle-winning equipment to the Navy’. Lt Gen Applegate also bragged of flouting the lobbying ban. He denies breaking any rules. Mr Hammond warned arms firms over . their behaviour. He said: ‘If we were to make clear to companies the . kind of lobbying being talked about here will damage rather than benefit . them, that will be quite effective.’ Lord Stirrup, who retired as the head . of the UK military two years ago with a £2.9million pension pot, said he . would encourage his military contacts to tell the MoD about the drones. The former airman said yesterday he told the undercover reporters lobbying was not an effective way to win business. He added it would be ‘strange’ for a military man not to be interested in technology which could save British soldiers’ lives. The MoD said it was investigating whether any rules had been broken.","Several generals caught in newspaper sting .

The man, in his 30s, was gunned down after firing a .357 Magnum revolver as armed officers swarmed into his house in the eastern city of Strasbourg. Seven others, including another gunman in Paris, were arrested during a nationwide anti-terrorist operation. Sting operation: A man, in his 30s, was shot dead as police arrested terror suspects around France . Armed siege: A policeman from the GIPN - French national police intervention groups - stands guard outside a building in Cannes, southeastern France, where me connected with an extremist Islamic group were arrested . Dramatic scenes: All the men arrested are believed to be part of the Salafist group which is waging a holy war in Europe . Organised: The anti-terror operation was carried out in several cities around France - notably in Strasbourg where a suspect was fatally wounded . All were suspected of being involved in an attack on a Jewish shop in which one person was slightly injured last month. The extreme violence used by the authorities in the face of Muslim extremism was praised by President Francois Hollande who 'saluted the action of the police' and urged Interior Minister Manuel Valls to 'take all measures necessary to ensure vigilance.' All the men targetted today were said to be linked to a Salafist group which is committed to waging a jihad - or holy war - across Europe. It follows Mohammed Merah, a 23-year-old French Algerian with similar Salafism connections, shooting seven people, including four Jews, dead in the Toulouse area in March. At least three policemen were injured . in today's Strasboug raid, while others received direct hits to their . bullet proof jackets and helmets. Heavily armed: Police officers wore full protective clothing including bullet proof vests, helmets and shields . The anti-terror operation comes after extremist Mohammed Merah killed seven people - including four Jews - in Toulouse in March . The suspect, meanwhile, was hit by a number of bullets and died at the scene, despite being treated by medics for his wounds. The source said the man's veiled wife . and child were in the Strasbourg house, and that the woman was one of . those arrested for questioning. 'He was initially on the sofa, but then started to fire at police with a .357 Magnum,' the source added.

It was part of a nationwide . counter-terrorist operation aimed at capturing the gang responsible for . planting a low explosive device in a kosher food shop in the northern . Paris suburb of Sarcelles on September 19th. A judicial source in the French . capital said all the men targeted today were thought to be members of a . secretive Salafist group. Referring to another Paris suburb, the . source said: 'A prosecutor in Pontoise was recently withdrawn from the . case and replaced with an anti-terrorist prosecutor in Paris. It was him . who sanctioned this morning's raids. 'Armed police visited a number of . addresses across the country in coordinated raids. The suspect in . Strasbourg tried to resist arrest by firing at officers who had stormed . into his home.' The raids were coordinated by the Central Directorate of Internal Intelligence (DCRI) and the terrorism sub-directorate (SDAT) of the Judicial Police. The source said that a gunman arrested in Paris had been acting in a 'threatening and dangerous manner' but was quickly disarmed with no injuries. An Interior Ministry spokesman said raids had today (sat) taken place at addresses in cities all over the country, and notably in Nice, Cannes, and Paris. He said there had been seven arrests in all. Police have been on heightened alert since the attacks by Merah, who was himself finally shot dead by police. Merah had strong links to Salafist groups in the Toulouse area, where he was brought up, and there are fears that they may have assisted his murderous crimes.

A former Bengals cheerleader left court today hand-in-hand with the student she admitted to having a sexual relationship with after avoiding jail. Sarah Jones, 27, pleaded guilty to having sex with the 17-year-old student at a Kentucky school where she was a teacher. She also admitted to sexual misconduct and custodial interference. In a tearful admission, Jones told the . court today: 'I began a romantic relationship while he was a student and . I was in a position of authority.' She left court in Covington with her former student but her lawyer would not comment on the nature of their current  relationship. Scroll down for video . Freed: Former Bengals cheerleader Sarah Jones walked free from court in Kentucky today, hand-in-hand with the student she was accused of having sex with while he was 17 . Deals: Former teacher and cheerleader Sarah Jones, left, and her mother Cheryl Jones, right, avoided jail after accepting plea deals in Kentucky . Victim: Jones admitted to having sex with a student (pictured) at the high school where she taught English when he was 17 . Jones said the relationship began in February 2011 when the boy was 17, saying that the two had sex, that she sent him sexually explicit text messages and lied about the relationship to police. In accepting the plea agreement, Judge Patricia Summe granted prosecutors' recommendation to sentence Jones to five years of diversion but no jail time, and she won't have to register as a sex offender. The diversion requires Jones to report to a probation officer, and undergo drug tests. The former student cannot be named or identified because he is the victim of a sex crime. Prosecutors said they made the deal because the teenager, now 18, and his family were uncooperative with them and sided with his former teacher. Part of the reason defense attorney Eric Deters said Jones was willing to plead guilty was because the judge had denied his request to keep the text messages that she sent to the teen out of the trial. 'They're embarrassing,' Deters told reporters after the hearing. 'They were steamy.' 'Rumours': Jones taught high school but quit last November for 'personal reasons' He also said that now that the teenage is 18 years old, he and Jones 'are free to be together' and pointed out that they left the courtroom together. Deters declined to discuss details of their current relationship, saying that they likely would do that themselves at some point in the future. The attorney said that Jones will not try out to be a Bengals cheerleader in the future, and that for now, she's working as a legal assistant in his office. Jones has expressed interest in becoming a lawyer and was studying to take the Law School Admission Test, he said. The 27-year-old had taught at Dixie Heights . High School before resigning last November. She was indicted in March. A . trial in the case had been set to start on Wednesday. She agreed to never again take a teaching or coaching job as part of the plea deal. The disgraced teacher can have the felony custodial interference charge wiped from her record. Her mother, former school principal Cheryl Armstrong Jones, 55, also pleaded guilty on Monday to a misdemeanor charge of tampering with evidence. She admitted to the judge that she sent the teenage boy a text message telling him to get rid of his phone. Sarah Jones had been under house arrest after she was charged with sexual abuse for sleeping with a student at Dixie Heights High School where she taught English. Avoiding jail: Jones, pictured an at earlier court date, agreed as part of the deal that she would never take a teaching or coaching job again . The five-year veteran of the NFL's . Ben-Gals cheerleading team has said the rumors were started by the alleged victim's bitter . ex-girlfriend. However she admitted there were 9,000 pages of . photos, Facebook messages and texts between her and the student. The indictment, filed in March, states . the alleged sexual relationship with the high school student took place . between October 1 and December 31. She pleaded not guilty in April. She also pleaded not guilty to . unlawful use of electronic means to induce a minor to engage in sexual . activities, a charge often reserved for people peddling child . pornography over the internet. In the interview earlier this year, Jones said that she has only had sex with one man, her ex-husband, Nathan Wilburn. They married in July last year and separated just one month later. They are now divorced. Jones also grabbed headlines in 2009 . when photographs and postings uploaded on TheDirty.com branded her a . 'slut' with 'two STDs'.

A Briton accused of beating his girlfriend to death in Crete today tearfully declared he wants to visit her grave to 'say goodbye to the love of my life'. Luke Walker has returned to the UK on bail and spoke for the first time since being arrested on suspicion of murdering 20-year-old Chelsea Hyndman on the Greek holiday island in 2010. In an interview at his family home he also claimed he was at Chelsea’s bedside when she died and told her: 'I love you, I will wait here for you and I will see you in a bit.' Court case: Luke Walker, left, at home in Brierley Hill, West Midlands after returning from Crete. He says he wants to visit the grave of former girlfriend Chelsea Hyndman, right, who he is accused of murdering . Accused: Luke with father Patrick. Walker came back from the Greek island yesterday and went to a local carvery for the evening . Chelsea had been working at the party resort of Malia when she died after suffering severe injuries to her abdomen. Greek prosecutors claim she was beaten by Walker, from Brierley Hill, West Midlands, but he claims she fell during a night out in Malia and actually died 10 days later from septicaemia. Speaking for the first time since he was granted bail following a judges’ strike in Crete, Luke said he wanted to say his final goodbye to the ‘love of his life’ Chelsea. Carefree: Ms Hyndman and Walker were both living on the Greek island and working in bars before she died . He also claimed Greek doctors originally told him Chelsea, from Castleford, West Yorkshire just had food poisoning and was not seriously ill. 'I was at work on the night, I didn’t know about the fall and I was just told it happened afterwards. 'She came home that night but a couple of days later she fell ill with stomach pains and I took her back to hospital. 'Chelsea was in agony and it was hard to get much sense from the doctors as they didn’t speak English but they did tell me they thought it was food poisoning. Tragic loss: Miss Walker (middle row, 3rd left) died on a night out in the resort town of Malia . Place in the sun: Ms Hyndman's family have said in the past no verdict could ever bring her daughter back and are distraught at her death . 'She was in hospital for a few days but 10 days after I took her in, she suddenly died. 'As she was going down to the operating theatre I held her hand and said to her ‘keep fighting, I love you, I will wait here for you, don’t worry I will see you in a bit. 'But she never regained consciousness. 'Now I just want to go and see her grave and visit the memorial garden that was planted in memory - I have not been able to say goodbye and grieve properly. I really need to go and do that. 'To be accused of murdering her is heart-wrenching. She was my everything, I would have married her.' After her death, Walker was arrested by police and charged with murder. He spent five months in a Greek prison but was released on bail on the conditions he must stay on the island until his trial. But last week his trial was halted because judges in Greece went on strike and key prosecution and defence witnesses were not available. He returned back to the UK on Tuesday evening where he revealed the first thing he did was go to the pub for a carvery with his family. 'I never thought I would enjoy this weather so much. It’s been strangely nice to see double decker buses and all the grey buildings around the Black Country,' he said. Party town: Until yesterday Walker was in Crete for two-and-a-half years, where he originally worked in a bar in Malia, pictured . 'I went straight to the pub for a carvery with my nan, brother-in-law and cousin. A British roast dinner never tasted so good. To be back in my own bed was incredible - it’s the first time I’ve slept all night in two and a half years. 'I’m happy to be back but it’s not a celebration, I still have a trial to go through and I still want to clear my name. If I get a court summons back there tomorrow I will be on the first plane out. 'It’s not a country I’ve enjoyed being obviously. Greek prisons are absolute hell and even when I was out I just kept my head down. I didn’t have many friends out there but people came out to see me when they could. 'The support has been overwhelming - and I’m happy to be home for now. There’s still a long way to go.'","Luke Walker is accused of killing Chelsea Hyndman in 2010 and has been granted bail and returned to the UK .

Duut spent around £2,000 at Bicester Village in Oxfordshire and checked into an upmarket Birmingham hotel after leaving his aunt for dead . He then drove to an upmarket shopping centre with his gay partner, who was unaware of the plot, and embarked on a £2,500 spending spree on clothes. Duut then checked into a separate four-star hotel, Birmingham’s landmark Radisson Blu, before going out and buying fellow drinkers cocktails at up to £144 a round. But unbeknown  to Duut, his victim regained  consciousness three hours after the attack. Police arrested him after he returned to his hotel that night. Duut initially denied attempted murder but changed his plea and was jailed indefinitely after appearing for sentence yesterday. Judge Paul Farrer QC ordered him to serve at least eight years before becoming eligible for parole over what he described as a ‘premeditated and carefully planned attempt to murder’. The court heard Duut, who was £60,000 in debt, had stolen a total of £10,050 from his aunt’s account just a month before the attack. Miss McDonnell, a divorcee, was staying at the three-star Ramada hotel in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands – which was used for exterior shots of the motel in the former ITV soap opera Crossroads – for a short period after her nearby flat suffered fire damage. Duut attacked his aunt in the Ramada Hotel in Walmley, Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham . She gave Duut her bank details when he offered to help her handle the insurance claim, and was unaware any money had gone. Birmingham Crown Court heard that in the three days before the attack in December, Duut had used his mobile phone to search online for murders which had been made to look like suicides. The court heard Duut arrived at his aunt’s hotel at 10.40am and went up to her room, where he gave her a cup of tea laced with sleeping aid Nytol. He then got her to lie on the bed for a massage – something he used to do for her when he was younger – before throttling her from behind. David Jackson, prosecuting, said: ‘She remembers shouting at him to “stop it, please stop it” and trying to kick out.’ He said she came around in the locked bathroom wearing just her underwear, with ‘several empty blister packets of prescription tablets strewn across the floor’. Miss McDonnell raised the alarm with hotel staff after coming to in her bathroom at around 2.20pm . She was found only at 2.20pm when a hotel maid heard her cries for help. ‘She was in extreme pain and she was gagging and vomiting,’ said Mr Jackson. ‘She thought she had had a heart attack or a stroke.’ Miss McDonnell was treated in hospital for severe bruising around her face, neck and back. Tests also found traces of codeine and diazepam in her blood. A medical expert said the injuries suggested throttling for between 15 to 20 seconds – with 30 seconds widely accepted as enough to kill someone. Gary Bell QC, defending, said that Duut’s crime was ‘a bizarre episode  of madness’ by a man with ‘some psychopathic tendencies’. Judge Farrer told Duut: ‘I have no doubt that you believed you had killed her. The victim here was somebody who trusted you. You are undoubtedly a highly manipulative individual prepared to resort to extreme violence to achieve your ends.’","James Duut tried to strangle his aunt and scattered pills around her apparently lifeless body .

If you are looking for somewhere dry to shelter from the wet autumn weather, don't visit this art gallery. The exhibition consists of a sheet of rain pelting down within the walls of a bare room. Sensors around the 'Rain Room' are supposed to detect where visitors are standing and keep them dry. The audience is invited to 'experiment with boundaries' of the work at the Barbican in London, and 'see if they can get wet'. Scroll down for video . Why does it always rain on me? The 100sq-m 'Rain Room' allows curious visitors to stand under a downpour in semi-darkness . Braving the elements... indoors: Art collective Random International say the experimental artwork will expose different personalities - with some rushing in and others simply watching . Technically complex: The deluge is 'carefully choreographed' so sensors detect people and ensure they stay dry . Typical English weather: The artists describe the rather familiar experience as 'an exercise in trust' Art collective Random International instructs curious visitors to either watch the 'spectacle' or walk through it. At least viewers will not have to deal with the obstacles of traffic and pedestrians that flood the streets outside the studio's doors. Instead, the room is black and completely bare except for lights highlighting the deluge. The studio behind the 100m-sq installation describes it as a marvel of 'technical virtuosity' and 'sculptural rigour'. The raindrops pour from the ceiling on to the grated floor through injection moulded tiles using a system of valves, and pressure regulators. Custom software and 3D tracking cameras are used to stop the water from falling in spots where people are standing. No dampened spirits here: The three artists claim the artwork is an opportunity to people-watch and break boundaries . 'Every day heightened': The unusual artwork encourages umbrella-wielding observers to see if they can get wet . Drizzly and dim: The room is comprised of a dark corridor and brightly lit room, so people passing through will not have to worry about traffic on top of the rain for once . But the 'monumental proportions of this . carefully choreographed downpour and the sound of water' may be a little wasted on those who live in this hemisphere. Thankfully, the soggy experience is free. Dancers will 'respond' to the work at the Barbican's Curve exhibition space on four dates, yet to be set.

The trio met in 2005 while students at the Royal College of Art in London. Mr Wood said the Rain Room was 'a social experiment, designed to extract personality types'. 'It's a people-watching space,' he added. 'We watch people going in tentatively at first, or if you're of the ilk of being really excitable and outgoing you might just rush in. 'This piece is just every day heightened. It's up to people to experiment with it and play with it, to push its boundaries and see if they can get wet.'

Steptoe and Son actor Wilfrid Brambell last night became the latest BBC star accused of child sex abuse. Two men claimed the late actor molested them when they were children in Jersey in the early 1970s. He was named following the scandal engulfing the corporation over the reign of abuse carried out by Jimmy Savile. Allegations: Wilfred Brambell, pictured in 1971, has been accused of abusing two young boys in Jersey . The actor, who played Albert Steptoe, is accused of attacking the boys in a back room at a theatre. One of the boys lived at the infamous Haut de la Garenne children’s home, the focus of a major Channel Islands police investigation into child abuse. He said he was taken to the Opera House, Jersey’s main theatre, as a ‘treat’ before meeting Brambell backstage where he was molested. TV star: Wilfrid Brambell, pictured right as Albert Steptoe, starred alongside Harry H Corbett as Harold Steptoe in the popular BBC comedy . The other boy said he was also abused by the actor there. Both were between 11 and 13 at the time. Old classic: The boys were taken to meet Wilfrid Brambell, pictured with Harry H Corbett and Carolyn Seymour in Steptoe and Son, as a 'treat' Former . Jersey health minister Stuart Syvret, an outspoken critic of the . handling of the Haut de la Garenne scandal, said the men were among . dozens who had come to him with allegations, including some against . Jimmy Savile. He told the Mail: ‘In Jersey everyone covers each other’s backs when it comes to the child abuse situation. ‘The . two boys came to me about Brambell because they did not trust the . police. They came to me and told me they were sexually abused by him. ‘They were both around the ages of 11, 12 or 13 and didn’t know each other so I am sure they were telling the truth. ‘They said the abuse happened in the back rooms of the Jersey Opera House – behind the stage. One of them was a resident at the Haut de la Garenne at the time.’ Brambell, who died of cancer in 1985, was gay, although he had been married briefly in the 1950s. He had a criminal record after being arrested in 1962 for soliciting in a public toilet in Shepherd’s Bush, London, and battled alcoholism in his later life. The Dublin-born actor became a household name in the 1960s and 1970s playing a rag and bone man in Steptoe and Son. His co-star, Harry H Corbett, constantly derided him on the sitcom as ‘you dirty old man’. Brambell also appeared as Paul McCartney’s grandfather in the Beatles film A Hard Day’s Night in 1964. Scandal: Jimmy Savile, pictured in 2000, allegedly abused children over four decades . When he died at the age of 72, only a . handful of people turned up at his funeral. He left the bulk of his . estate, and a flat in Pimlico, London, to a close friend and flatmate, . Yussof Bin Mat Saman. BBC bosses are said to  have hushed up the alleged molestation of young boys by a children’s radio star. It is claimed they wrote to any parents who complained advising them not to take the allegations further. The name has been passed to police examining allegations against Jimmy Savile. The alleged abuse was first raised in BBC World Affairs Editor John Simpson’s autobiography in 1999. He said he was told of it when compiling the obituary of the man, whom he gave the pseudonym ‘Uncle Dick’, shortly after his death in 1967. Simpson claimed his immediate boss told him to keep it secret. But last night thousands could see his name on Twitter, after users followed the clues given by Simpson. The man’s daughters and grandchildren said yesterday that the claims were ‘complete rubbish’. Yesterday health chiefs announced an inquiry into Jimmy Savile’s reign of abuse at three NHS hospitals. It will be run by the Department of Health itself, raising fears it cannot be truly independent. Former barrister Kate Lampard will oversee the investigation to provide ‘independent oversight’. It . will examine why the presenter was given the keys to Broadmoor mental . hospital, a bedroom at Stoke Mandeville and free rein at Leeds General . Infirmary. He allegedly raped and molested young victims for decades without anyone stopping him. There . are suspicions a blind eye was turned to the abuse because the . hospitals reaped millions of pounds through Savile’s fundraising. Labour is still calling for a full independent inquiry into the scandal. Deputy . leader Harriet Harman said: ‘I think what we need to do is get to the . truth. Clearly something terrible went on for many years across a number . of institutions and I think we need to learn the lessons.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘[Kate Lampard] will provide oversight of the Stoke Mandeville, Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor inquiries as well as the Department of Health’s inquiries into the appointment and role Savile held at Broadmoor Hospital. ‘All relevant information from these inquiries will be passed to  the police.’ Unlike the BBC, which has issued several grovelling apologies, none of the hospitals has yet said sorry for the abuse. Savile, who raised £40million for Broadmoor, boasted that he ‘lived’ in a bedroom managers had given him at Stoke Mandeville, Buckinghamshire, and said he could do as he pleased. Tory MP Rob Wilson, an aide to the Health Secretary, has questioned whether Savile’s fundraising ‘made him untouchable’ at the hospital. He demanded an independent inquiry ‘so we understand who knew what and when they knew it’. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Actor Wilfrid Brambell allegedly abused the boys in a theatre in Jersey .

There were 3.9million crimes recorded in England and Wales in the past year, the lowest since 1989, statistics revealed yesterday. Total crime has fallen by around a third in a  decade, from its peak in the mid-1990s, and by 6 per cent in the past 12 months. 'Welcome news': The latest statistics, compiled using both crimes recorded by police and the Crime Survey for England and Wales, show a decrease in the number of offences over the past decade . Only pickpocketing and other personal thefts were up, by 6 per cent, continuing a rise which began three years ago. Criminologists added a note of . caution, warning the official figures were under-counting certain types . of crime, such as card fraud. Estimates of violent crime are now at around half the level seen in 1995, according to the Crime Survey of England and Wales . Due to the way crime is recorded, the . worst  incidents of civil unrest in England in recent memory barely . registered in the figures. Dr David Green, of the Civitas . think-tank, said: ‘We are entitled to be a little bit suspicious about . such a major fall. They do not count each victim of card fraud as a . victim, but individual banks. I think there’s an awful lot more fraud . than is contained within the figures. Crime stats no longer cover all . the main types of crime that are going on.’ But he said high prison population . numbers meant many of the repeat criminals ‘who need to be in prison are . there’ and this would have a downward impact on crime figures. The . statistics for the 12 months to June this year show that police-recorded . burglary was down 6 per cent, robbery 7 per cent and violent attacks 6 . per cent. Criminal damage was down 12 per cent, firearms offences 18 per . cent and car theft 14 per cent. Homicide was down 14 per cent. There was further good news from the . National Crime Survey, also published yesterday. According to ministers, . it suggested that members of the public were ‘less likely to be a . victim of crime than at any time since 1981’. Based on interviews with 40,000 people . about their experiences of crime in the past year, it  suggested crime . was at its lowest level since the survey began in 1981, with 10million . offences recorded – half the level seen in 1995. While the latest figures indicate that overall levels of crime are falling, they show that pick-pocketing increased over the past year . The falls showed that cuts to police . red tape were freeing up officers, said Crime Prevention Minister Jeremy . Browne. 'Crime has been falling for 20 years now. We welcome this of course, but we know from the thousands of victims we’ve helped in the last month alone that crime is a real problem for a lot of people' Javed KhanVictim Support chief executive . He added: ‘Police reform is working. We have swept away central . targets and reduced bureaucracy.

"By . Deborah Arthurs . UPDATED: . 16:31 EST, 24 November 2011 . A model who held the record for the world's largest implants has had them boosted once more after losing her 38MMM breasts to a life-threatening infection. Shockingly, despite saying her new implants make her feel 'almost whole again', the 31-year-old mother is still not satisfied, insisting her massively inflated breasts are 'small'. Sheyla Hershey, from Houston, Texas, underwent the extreme breast augmentation operation in an attempt to regain the staggering 38KKK cup size she had before the removal of her breasts. Boost: Sheyla Hershey has reinflated her breasts to a size 38KKK after having her previous implants removed following a life-threatening blood infection . An infection that set in after her 30th breast enlargement operation led to 5ft 3in Sheyla undergoing emergency operation in June 2010 that left with . unattractive sagging skin where her implants had . been. So obsessed was Sheyla with . maintaining her Guinness World Record that the loss of her implants almost drove her to suicide. 'Not having my breasts was killing me, I didn't know if I could make it through 2012 without them,' she said. 'My breasts had become part of me and I was deformed without them. I felt like I had lost a leg.' The . 31-year-old, who had the operation in secret to prevent her concerned . husband from finding out, says she is elated with the results. 'It is a miracle. I never thought I would have my breasts back again,' she said. 'I almost feel whole again.' Sheyla ignored the wishes of doctors, . psychiatrists and her husband Derek - all of whom feared the trauma of . yet more surgery could cause a return of the infection - and organised a . tour of cosmetic surgery practitioners in Latin America in September. Sad: Sheyla, 31, says she felt like she had lost . a limb when her implants were removed. 'I was depressed. My breasts . fill my self-esteem,' she says. Right, Sheyla aged 21, before enlarging . her breasts with 30 operations . 'My husband knew that I was going to Cancun in Mexico to get my breasts reconstructed,' said Sheyla. 'He . didn't know that I was going to have them reinflated with saline and . that I planned to return to my previous size of 38MMM, but I was . desperate to claim my status as having the world's largest breast . implants. Sheyla had . 2,500cc of saline liquid implanted into her reconstructed breasts in . late September, before flying to her hometown of Vitoria in Brazil to . have more saline gradually introduced. 'I increased slowly over a two-month period and now my breasts are back at 4,300cc of liquid and are 38KKK,' she says. In the New Year, Shayla says she will have more surgery to take them back to 5,500cc, or 38MMM. Sheyla lied to concerned husband Derek, 29, who stayed at home in Houston, Texas while she went for what he thought was reconstructive surgery. 'He was asking me for pictures to see how the surgery had gone, but I kept on telling him to wait till I returned home,' said Sheyla. 'When he saw me he was shocked and hurt that I had lied to him. I told him that it is my body and I can do what I want to it, but he didn't talk to me for a week and he threatened me with divorce. 'I told him if he wants one he should go get one, but he didn't and now he has accepted my breasts are almost back being the way they were. 'If I am happy, then he is happy.' 'Deformed': After having emergency surgery to remove her breast implants, Sheyla says she felt deformed. 'I just wanted to wake up and have my breasts again,' she says . Her obsession - she has paid over £60,000 over a decade to maintain her breasts - has almost cost Sheyla both her family and her life - but to Shayla, it is worth the risk.# . Sheyla says her husband Derek . 'worries so much' for her safety, and for the impact Sheyla's body . obsession could have on their daughter, two-year-old Victoria. 'He doesn't want me to keep on having these operations and he says that every time I go he thinks I might not come back alive. 'My husband worried I wouldn't come back alive, but I just wanted to have my breasts again.' 'Derek says he doesn't want me to look like a porn star and tells me that I have a daughter now.' 'He says, ""how do you think your little girl will look at you and your breasts?"" 'I tell him that she loves them and that I am a good mother.' Sheyla, who suffers bipolar disorder, maintains her huge breasts make her feel better about herself. 'The size of my breasts is what fills my self esteem,' she says. 'I talked to my psychiatrist and I explained that if you lose something that you love it is natural to want them back.' 'I overdosed earlier this year after accidentally taking too many painkillers, but I had become so sad that I couldn't bear to leave the house. 'I just wanted to go to sleep and wake up and have my breasts again.' Despite the staggering size of her former record-breaking 38MMM breasts, Sheyla is insistent that her implants should be even larger. 'I never think my breasts are big enough. Even now I look in the mirror and I think they are small. 'Because of my frame, the surgeons say I physically can't go any bigger than I was before. I will be happy with 38MMM, because I would rather they were that size than not at all, but I would like to be bigger.","Sheyla Hershey, 31, nearly died after boob job infection .

She lives alone on a rural farm and spends her days in the company of sheep and border collies, so it's no wonder shepherdess Emma Gray has admitted she's lonely. The modern day Little Bo Peep rejected 21st century life to run a remote sheep farm in Hexham, Northumberland, three years ago, and now says she'd love to meet someone to share her life with. 'I would like someone to share my life with but it’s hard because it’s not really a job where you meet guys,' she said. 'When I tell people what I do most of the time they don’t believe me and they are quite shocked.' High on a hill is a lonely shepherdess: Emma Gray would love to meet someone to share her life with . The 26-year-old first started herding sheep on her grandparent’s farm as a child and got a degree in sheep management after leaving school. At the age of 23, she became the sole tenant of a hill farm with no electricity or gas after breaking up with her fiancé. She then went on to represent England in the International Sheepdog trials. Now Emma, who has a flock of 150 sheep and a squad of 13 sheepdogs, has written a book, One Girl and her Dogs, about her solitary country life and hopes for companionship. 'I can live without mains gas and mains electricity and I make sure I speak to one person a day... I suppose my situation is quite unusual,' she admitted. 'Let’s face it. I’m a 26-year-old girl living alone, miles from the nearest main road.' Emma grew up on the farm of her dad Richard, 53, and mother Helen, 49, near Hawick, in the Scottish borders, and was helping round up sheep as soon as she could walk. One girl and her dogs: Emma also takes part in international sheepdog trials . But the family’s idyllic life turned sour with the outbreak of foot and mouth disease which devastated their flock. The troubled times didn’t stop Emma and at the age of 19 she got her first job as a shepherdess at a farm in Hexham, Northumberland. She worked on there for four years and at the age of 23 put in a bid to the National Trust for the farm. Despite fierce competition, The National Trust chose Emma to take on the responsibility in November 2009. She said: 'When I first saw the farm it was very run-down but there were lots of people looking around wanting to buy it. I don’t know why the National Trust chose me over older, more experienced farmers with families. Maybe it was because of my enthusiasm. Farming is in my blood and I like a challenge.'Emma took out a £10,000 bank loan and moved in that winter. She spent the first few weeks living in the kitchen as the entire house was flooded due to burst pipes. She set to work redecorating and even reconstructed a dry stone wall with her bare hands. She now makes a living breeding livestock and sheepdogs, as well as training dogs for trials. Last year, she represented England at the International Sheepdog Trials with her top dog, Roy, in Tain, in the Highlands. Rural living: The shepherdess has no mains gas or electricity at her hill tip farm . She has only been on one holiday since taking over the farm as she doesn't like to leave her animals for more than one night. Socialising can also be difficult because of her remote abode. 'I like to go for a drink with my friends once a week but it takes about 45 minutes to get to the pub and I can’t drink because I’m usually driving,' she said. 'I tried to have a house party when I first moved in but the generator broke and the lights went out, the whole thing was a disaster. Needless to say I haven’t had one since.'

"By . Owen Anslow . PUBLISHED: . 11:49 EST, 19 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:50 EST, 22 July 2012 . LAST month, under the glare of multiple flashbulbs, the world was told: 'Girl Power is back.' With forced smiles and uncomfortable hugs, five women were shuffled into position by their pushy PR teams and ordered to ooze the youthful happiness and energy that once made them the biggest girl band in the world. Become the legend: The game follows Lara Croft as she transforms into a hunter . But the eyes never lie, and it was clear for most to see that the once iconic faces didn’t Wannabe there. They just didn’t want to zig-a-zig-a anymore. (One in particular made that abundantly clear with a trademark pout.) It seemed that Girl Power had run out and was in desperate need of the Duracell Bunny. Sixteen years ago, when Mel C, Mel B, Ginger, Sporty, Scary and whatsherface, had pretty much taken over the planet - another icon was born. Softly spoken, athletic and smart, she was touring the globe herself - unearthing ancient treasures in Cairo, killing crocodiles in the Tomb of Tihocan and squeezing off rounds from her Desert Eagle handgun like Sarah Palin hooked up to a Red Bull drip. She took Girl Power up a few notches. In fact, she made it a force to be reckoned with. Her name? Lara Croft. Not LC, not Crofty Spice...and any suggestions of Spicing Up Her Life would be met with a firm uppercut followed by a devastating roundhouse. And just like The Spice Girls, Lara is due to make a highly-anticipated comeback. So, is her makeover a canny, well-crafted upgrade or a tired attempt to re-tie frayed puppet strings and dust off old dance routines? Smoking hot: Lara's had a makeover and looks great . Well, unlike the characters in Spice World, the heroine of Tomb Raider has grown in strength, agility and beauty. I was invited to a hands-on with the new game, which isn’t out until next year, yet it was still a tantalising look at what fans can expect from the return of Lara Croft. Set as a prequel to the original games, the star of the show is a young 21-year-old who is out to prove herself to the world after graduating from university. But all chaos breaks loose when the ship she is travelling on breaks up and Lara is washed-up on a mysterious island. All alone, she desperately searches for her mentor Captain Conrad Roth and any other survivors of the shipwreck. The early plot sets the tone for what is bound to be a dark tale. Lara has to sneak past some gun-toting gang on the island who are not afraid to kill anyone in their path. It’s a gritty angle which tells the story of how Lara goes from a frightened young woman to a hardened survivor. I played through one of the opening levels of the game, which acts a tutorial for Crystal Dynamic’s new masterpiece. Visually the game is inspired, with jungle greenery shining through and high-res raindrops dampening lost Lara’s spirits. Her facial interpretation is also meticulous, with life-like qualities adding to her vulnerable yet plucky character. Every hair, scratch and tear is beautifully rendered and results in a more human Lara, like you’ve never seen before. Plus, she's voiced by actress Camilla Luddington - best known for playing Kate Middleton in American TV movie, William and Kate. Bow selecta: Never mind guns, Lara has to learn to use a bow and arrow first . The action-adventure sees a lot of physical running, jumping and climbing - just like the original games. However, there seems to be less of the acrobatics which Lara was famed for years ago. After finding a bow & arrow, Lara goes hunting. The shooting mechanics work well as you draw an aim on a poor deer oblivious to the little hunter. Lara also fends off three or four nasty wolves which leap out of the trees at her after she gets stuck in an animal trap. Your main objective is highlighted when you jump into Survival Instinct vision. It’s similar to Detective Mode in Arkham games but only highlights clues and tips for a moment instead of being on constantly. Campsites can be found jotted around the open world environment and here you can save your progress and upgrade weapons. These Base Camps also allow you to customise Lara’s skill tree. Sadly, there was a distinct lack of puzzles which were such a vital part of the original games but fingers crossed these will become more apparent as the title goes on. I had a brief look at some later levels too which involved a lot of shooting, ducking and diving. As well as stealthy takedowns, Lara later learns how explosive barrels can be just as effective and a headshot. Hanging around: Set pieces break up the gameplay nicely - and look superb, too . From the looks of things, Tomb Raider is bang on track to make Lara’s return a successful one which stays true to the roots of this gaming icon. Too often we have seen original ideas, concepts and characters tampered with years down the line in a desperate bid to make money. Most of the time these cobbled together comebacks wilt and fade after being reintroduced to the spotlight. But not Lara Croft...under this intense glare she shines even brighter than before.

Convicted: Waseem Daker, now 35, spent a decade behind bars for stalking Loretta Blatz and now he is on trial for killing her roommate . A man accused of stalking a woman on his paintball team before killing her roommate was found with how-to manuals about getting away with murder, a court was told. Prosecutors in the Waseem Daker murder . trial showed jurors that when the 35-year-old was arrested in 2009 police also found rope and . handcuffs in his . possession. Jurors in Marietta, Georgia, were . presented with 12-year-old emails that prosecutors say prove Daker . obtained disturbing materials before committing murder. The . 'how-to' titles were titled 'How to get Away with Murder' and 'Kill Without . Joy', ABC News reported. Daker allegedly strangled flight attendant Karmen Smith to death in . 1995 and stabbed her then five-year-old son, Nick Smith, 18 times  as an act of revenge against her roommate, . Loretta Spencer Blatz, who helped send him to prison for harassing her. Just before going to serve a 10-year prison sentence for stalking . Blatz, prosecutors say Daker allegedly killed Smith. Daker is acting as his own . attorney which has made for some . awkward questioning when Blatz and Nick Smith took the stand. Judge Mary . Staley has nearly lost her cool a few times in this case, clearly . annoyed with Daker's courtroom antics, ABC News reported. 'There are numerous occasions . during the trial that your veracity has been in strong question by me. Strong!' said Staley. She added, 'And you don't try cases by ambush.' Daker had long been a suspect in . Karmen Smith's murder, but it wasn't until 2009 that, according to . authorities, tests showed hairs found on Smith's body matched Daker's . DNA. Daker and prosecutors are fighting . over those very DNA tests from the scene of the crime that police say . cracked the case and led to his arrest. Daker questioned homicide . detective John Dawes on Monday, and asked why police did not submit every . piece of evidence for DNA testing. Dawes explained that once they had Daker's DNA linking him to the crime scene there was no need for more tests. 'Which is more expensive? Doing a . DNA test or sending an innocent man to prison?' asked Daker, which drew . prosecutors into a frenzy, demanding an objection from the judge. Scene: At the time of her murder, Karmen Smith lived in the basement apartment of the house on Old Hunter's Trace (pictured) where Loretta Blatz lived in Marietta, Georgia, . Last Tuesday, Nick Smith, now 22, took the stand on what would have been his mother's birthday. 'From what I could tell it was a . man, but it was really dark and I just assumed that it was someone that I . knew...

Smith said he remembered a gloved . hand over his mouth. He said his assailant was also wearing a black mask . that covered his face. He said because of the mask he wasn't able to . get a good look at his attacker. On September 14, Blatz took the stand . and was clearly rattled having to be grilled by the man imprisoned for . stalking her relentlessly and accused of murdering her roommate. After several hours of . questioning, Blatz fought back against Daker when he asked the judge to . label her testimony during his questioning as 'inappropriate.' 'Well, you know, it's really . inappropriate that you stalk me and harass me, and you're sitting here . asking me questions, and I have to come back with you and answer your . questions, that's hard for me,' she said, breaking down and sobbing.

"By . James Tozer . UPDATED: . 19:57 EST, 16 February 2012 . A scanner darkly: The machines are being turned off at Manchester and Birmingham . Costly eye scanners that were meant to slash queues at airport passport control are being quietly scrapped, it emerged yesterday. Labour ministers brought in iris recognition checks at an estimated cost of £9million, claiming they were capable of processing travellers in as little as 12 seconds. But after 385,000 passengers submitted their details, the scanners have been ditched at Birmingham and Manchester airports, and they are expected to vanish from Heathrow and Gatwick after the Olympics. Critics said it was another expensive Government software failure, saying the system had ended up taking longer than traditional manual checks. Some irate travellers even ended up getting trapped inside the scanning booths when they malfunctioned. When the then immigration minister, Des Browne, unveiled the Iris Recognition Immigration System, known as Iris, in 2004, he claimed it would provide a ‘watertight’ check of identities as well as cutting queues. It was targeted at foreign passport holders resident in the UK or who regularly travel here and wanted to avoid lengthy queues. They had to undergo a free 15-minute registration to record the unique pattern of their iris every two years. The Iris system is understood to have cost a total of £4million to run on top of its development price of £4.9million. The contract was given to a French firm, Sagem. Plans to use the technology for UK passports and evden Labour’s ill-fated ID cards scheme were dropped after it emerged that up to one in ten travellers were wrongly rejected by the scanners. Scanner inspection: Labour Home Secretary Charles Clarke tries out one of the new scanners in 2005 as they were hailed by Ministers as a key weapon in the fight against terrorism and fraud . Trumpeted as a key tool in the fight against identity fraud, Iris scanners were expected to slash clues when they were launched by the Labour Government in 2004. But in reality the scanners were dead on arrival. The scheme cost £9million. Immigration minister Des Browne boasted at launch that the scanners would cut waiting times to just 12 seconds per passenger. The devices, which are free to use, were aimed at regular travellers. But perversely, passengers who want to dodge queues by using the scanners have to queue up for a 15-minute registration - then repeat the process every two years. With the registration scheme now closed, biometric scanners will be phased out within two years unless it it reopened. They then had to wait for manual checks to be performed. Subsequently, facial recognition . technology has been developed with the new generation of biometric . passports which can be used at automated ‘e-gates’. These chip-enabled passports are not . held by travellers from outside the European Economic Area, however, and . they have remained dependent on iris recognition. Lucy Moreton, deputy general . secretary of the Immigration Service Union, said the Iris scheme had . been beset with problems from the beginning. She added: ‘Iris scanners . are prone to throwing up false alerts when genuine travellers try to use . them. We welcome the decision to phase them out.’ James Baker, of privacy group No2ID, . said: ‘This is recognition that iris scanning is an expensive failure. The money would be better spent employing more trained staff to use . their initiative and check passports manually.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We are . phasing out Iris and will be replacing it with other types of gates . that non-EU passengers will be able to use.’","Iris scanners cost £9million when they were launched in 2004 .

A teenage bride on the hit TV show My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding has vowed to burn the huge five-stone wedding dress she wore down the aisle after separating from her husband. Josie McFayden was just 16 when she married Swanley Smith in an enormous frilly white frock followed by a team of bridesmaids dressed in hot pink in a ceremony watched by 6.5million viewers in July 2010. Now after less than two years of marriage and the birth of a daughter, Josie, 18, is getting divorced from her husband following a string of blazing rows. Lavish affair: Swanley and Josie Smith married in an extravagant ceremony when she was just 16, in front of 6.5million viewers . Rocky relationship: The pair split after less than two years of marriage following constant fights . Josie has moved out of the couple's caravan and is living in a house in Middlesex with their eight-month-old child, also called Josie, and her mother. Today Josie told how she was 'swept off her feet' by Swanley, 21, who she met on a social networking site six months before they married in her dream fairytale wedding. But she revealed to The Sun newspaper that cracks started to appear just days after the wedding and accused Swanley of treating her like 'a slave'. She said: 'It was like a fairytale, but it was too good to be true. Swanley just changed overnight. 'I was supposed to be a lady of leisure bringing my little girl up and he was supposed to provide for his family. 'But I spent four-and-a-half hours a day cleaning and he stopped going to work. I just never felt like his wife, I felt like his maid.' No holds barred: Guests typically dress to impress in the traveller weddings featured on the hit programme . Big day: Josie's little brother John McFadyen, 18, after saying his vows on the show to Cheyenne Pidgley, 16, who he met at his sister's wedding reception . She added that she felt a weight has been lifted off her shoulders after the split and she will burn her wedding dress to show it is truly over. Josie said she tried to make the marriage work as the travelling community frowns upon divorce and believe that the family comes before anything else. She admitted that 'in her world' the man comes first and wives are expected to obey. But the final straw came when she discovered Swanley had secretly spent their savings. The couple received a £105,000 compensation payment from Surrey County Council after they were forced to leave the site where they were living in Caterham when it was declared contaminated. But Josie claimed she didn't see any of the money while her husband gave half to his family and spent the rest buying himself X Box games and a £13,000 Rolex watch. She revealed that Swanley hasn't been to visit his daughter since the couple split but she hopes he will still play a part in her life. Josie, while insisting the split wasn't because she married too young, admitted that after her own experience she hopes her daughter won't get married until she's in her twenties. She added that she knows many other travelling couples who married young and are still very happy, including her brother John McFadyen who met his wife Cheyenne at her own wedding. She is now back with dad Chris and mum Josie at their home in Middlesex, where she is sharing a room with her sister Berry, 14. The bigger the better: Bride Danielle Marry, from Corby, Northamptonshire, and her bridesmaids wore huge dresses typical of the TV show .

Passers by who witnessed the horrific attack by the 'Miami cannibal' who ripped off the face of a homeless man with his teeth feared he was going to kill his victim. Police have revealed the calls from terrified members of the public who saw the violence attack against 65-year-old Ronald Poppo on a Miami highway. But none of them mentioned the extent of the injuries from the vicious assault, or the means by which the 'Miami cannibal' was attacking his victim - with his teeth. Poppo was once a student at a prestigious New York school before he became a down-and-out . Callers only reported seeing two men fighting in the shadow of The Miami Herald headquarters but did not mention seeing Poppo's face being torn off and eaten. 'He's going to kill that man, I promise you,' a female bus driver said, urging a 911 operator to send help. Poppo remains hospitalised. The driver, who wasn't named by authorities, described the scene as she drove by. 'Listen, there is a naked man on the MacArthur Causeway,' she said. 'He is beating another man to a pulp - like on top of the man, beating him, the man is bleeding.' Another caller said the two men were fighting, saying they nearly knocked over an elderly bicyclist. 'These two bums were going at it with each other, taking up the whole lane,' the caller said. 'I think they were fighting or something.' Callers only reported seeing two men fighting in the shadow of The Miami Herald headquarters but did not mention seeing Poppo's face being torn off and eaten . According to Miami police, the first call of a disturbance came from a passing motorist who reported seeing Eugene stripping off his clothes and acting erratically . The unidentified man gave his phone number to the 911 operator. He declined to comment when contacted Friday evening by The Associated Press. A second male caller didn't mention the fight, instead reporting that he saw a man taking off his clothes and throwing them into traffic. 'You can't miss him. He's naked,' the man said. Surveillance video shows Rudy Eugene, 31, attacking Poppo alongside the highway last Saturday afternoon. A police officer fatally shot Eugene during the attack. Police have not released a motive for the attack. Friends and relatives of Eugene have spoken of their complete shock at the news, claiming he must have been drugged. Eugene's girlfriend, who did not wish to be named, recently spoke out about her shock and disbelief about her boyfriend's attack. Eugene's mother Ruth Charles does not believe police accounts that her son Rudy Eugene assaulted Ronald Poppo and tore 70 per cent of his face off with his teeth . The Christian man never left the house without his Bible and she described him as sweet and well-mannered. 'That wasn’t him, that was his body but it wasn’t his spirit. Somebody did this to him,' she said. 'He loved God he always read the Bible he would give you knowledge on the Bible. Everywhere he went his Bible went. When he left he had his Bible in his hand.' Ruth Charles does not believe police . accounts that her son Rudy Eugene assaulted Ronald Poppo and tore 70 . percent of his face off with his teeth -- despite watching the . horrifying surveillance video of the attack. 'I knew my son. Rudy will never, never do something like that,' Ms Charles told WPLG. 'He was a good kid. He gave me a nice . card on Mother’s Day. Everyone says he was a zombie. He was no zombie. That was my son,' she told WFOR. She, along with Eugene's girlfriend . and his brother have painted a radically different picture of the . 31-year-old than the naked man seen using his teeth to tear flesh from . another man's face for 18 minutes. On the Saturday morning before he would make headlines for chewing off a man's face Rudy Eugene held his Bible and kissed his girlfriend goodbye . Poppo had been homeless for 30 years and his estranged family thought he was dead. His sister, Antoinette Poppo, thought he had killed himself years ago and was distraught by the news of his injuries. 'I really don’t understand what happened,' Ms Poppo said. 'We really thought he was no longer on this earth.' Mr Poppo had been living all this time on the streets of Florida and his family thought he had committed suicide years before. The Miami Herald reported that Mr Poppo would stay just outside a public restroom on the north side of Jungle Island in Miami. Ms Poppo only just learned that her brother was still alive this week, hanging on for dear life. 'I remember a very intelligent boy,' Ms Poppo told CBS, beginning to cry. 'I’m very upset. I’m just glad my mother isn’t here to see this.' The victim's daughter, Janice Poppo DiBello, 44, from New Jersey, was stunned this week when the New York Daily News told her that the victim of the gruesome attack which shocked America was in fact her absentee father. Janice Poppo DiBello, daughter of cannibal victim, Janice Poppo DiBello couldn't remember the father who abandoned her at age two . She told the paper: 'I’m really upset because I haven’t met my father. Since I was two-years-old, him and my mom got divorced and there was no — like how normal divorces are, where you see your father. 'Nobody ever heard anything from him, so I’ve never met him. I didn’t know if he was alive or dead.' Mr Poppo was once a student at a prestigious New York school before he became a down-and-out. A yearbook picture of Ronald Poppo was obtained by the New York Daily News, who reported the victim was in the Latin Club and worked in the guidance office at Stuyvesant High School before he became homeless. Recently released footage of the 65-year-old's dramatic rescue shows he was still conscious and moving his arms after the attack, while Rudy Eugene's body lay next to him. After paramedics tend to the victim's facial injuries, they carefully place him on a stretcher. As they carry him from the walkway where the attack took place to the ambulance, he starts to wave his arms around and has to be strapped down. As police piece together the last hours of Eugene's life, they believe he attended a Memorial Day weekend beach party before making the three-mile journey home on foot in more than 90F. He took off and scattered his clothes as he walked across the causeway - police later found his drivers license and clothes strewn from the beach to the mainland - before pouncing on the homeless man he found sleeping on the elevated train tracks, according to the Miami Herald. Rescue: Paramedics tend to the victim, putting him on a stretcher and tending to his injuries . Ronald Poppo is in a critical condition after Rudy Eugene attacked him and ate his face . Precaution: One of the paramedics then straps Mr Poppo to the strecther as they lead him away to the ambulance . After he strips and punches his victim, he straddles him before starting to eat his face off. Cars and a number of cyclists passed the two men while the attack took place. It was almost 20 minutes until officer Jose Rivera shot Eugene shortly after he arrived. He shouted at the 31-year-old to stop but he simply got up and growled and continued eating at the man's face. A former classmate of Eugene Victoria Forte, who attended North Miami Beach High School, told the Sun Sentinel: 'Drugs did this to him. Drugs took over a person we knew as a beautiful person.' According to Miami police, the first call of a disturbance came from a passing motorist who reported seeing Eugene stripping off his clothes and acting erratically. Poppo, his faced distorted but identifiable by his goatie, was in a critical condition in hospital . A Road Ranger called to the scene also called 911 and used a loudspeaker to call for the naked attacker to cease. As the attack dragged on, two other motorists called police, as did another cyclist, Larry Vega, who later told reporters that Eugene 'just stood, his head up like that, with pieces of flesh in his mouth. And he growled'. He also said it was the most gruesome and traumatic thing he had ever seen'. According to the Herald, Eugene had been in Miami Beach for the Memorial Day Weekend shortly before the attack. His car, a purple 1995 Chevrolet Caprice, was towed for being parked illegally at 1100 10th Street, according to police. It is believed Eugene was under the influence of a potent form of drug called 'bath salts' at the time but toxicology results will take several weeks.

"By . Leon Watson . PUBLISHED: . 05:38 EST, 17 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:35 EST, 28 June 2012 . The showpiece genocide and war crimes trial of the 'Butcher of Bosnia' Ratko Mladic was dramatically halted in The Hague today after an extraordinary and embarrassing blunder by prosecutors. Presiding judge Alphons Orie suspended the hearing of the former Bosnian Serb General indefinitely after prosecutors failed to disclose thousands of documents to the defence team. Incredibly, prosecutors had over 16 years while the 70 year-old, the one-time military commander accused of orchestrating the Srebrencia massacre of 8,000 men and boys, was on the run to prepare for the case. Scroll down to watch evidence shown to the court . Defiant: Ratko Mladic pictured left yesterday and right, in 1993 when he was commanding the Bosnian war . Discovered: Bosnian Serb army commander Ratko Mladic, who was arrested in Serbia after years in hiding. Picture from May 26, 2011 . But yesterday they acknowledged their mistakes which judge Orie described as 'significant disclosure errors.' The announcement could lead to a six-month delay and is seen as a major setback for the court in one of its highest profile cases, its final trial to focus on atrocities committed during the 1992-95 Bosnian war, which left over 100,000 dead. The proceedings are being broadcast live in Bosnia where Bosnian Serbs, who consider Mladic a hero, mocked the court greeting the decision with a mixture of laughter and applause. But for the families of Srebrenica's victims and other Bosnia atrocities it was a 'heartbreaking' blow and yet another delay in their quest to see the man they blame of the deaths of tens of thousands brought to justice. Anger: Bosnians demonstrate outside the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) during the trial of Former Bosnian Serb general Ratko Mladic . Leader: Ratko Mladic (centre) pictured arriving at the airport of Sarajevo in order to negotiate the withdrawal of his troops from Mount Igman in 1993 . Mladic is said to have suffered two strokes and heart problems while on the run and the fear of many Bosnian Muslims is that they will be robbed of justice again. And like ex-Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic he will die in custody before a judgement is reached. Judge Orie said the court will analyse the 'scope and full impact' of the error and aim to establish a new starting date 'as soon as possible.' The presentation of evidence was supposed to begin later this month and Mladic's attorney has asked for a six-month delay. Mladic faces 11 charges - ironically, several were dropped in a bid to speed-up the trial - and life imprisonment if convicted. He is accused of commanding Bosnian Serb troops who waged a campaign of murder and persecution to drive Muslims and Croats out of territory they considered part of Serbia and oversaw the 44-month siege of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, that killed 10,000. Court spokeswoman Nerma Jelacic said much of the material not given to the defence focused on witnesses who prosecutors had intended to call to testify. Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic (right) has been acquitted of one of the two genocide charges he facess. He is pictured with his general Ratko Mladic (left) in 1995 on Mountain Vlasic . Details of the evidence against Mladic had been outlined in chilling and graphic detail to the court before the sudden suspension of proceedings. Prosecuting counsel Peter McCloskey said the crimes at Srebrenica had never been in dispute so the prosecution's focus would be on individual criminal responsibility. He claimed the Bosnian Serb Army was not an 'army out of control' and that Mladic had been on the ground and in command. 'We have radio intercepts of VRS [Bosnian Serb] soldiers and officers discussing murders,' Mr McCloskey said. Wanted men: These posters were released by the U.S. State Department in 2000 . He added: 'We have video of two of the actual executions themselves. So let me be perfectly clear, the crime will not be the main focus of this prosecution. This case will be primarily about one issue. The individual criminal responsibility of Ratko Mladic.' The court watched video of local people panicking in a UN compound outside Srebrenica on 11 July 1995 as Bosnian Serb forces approached, followed by scenes of Mladic triumphantly entering the town. 'We give this town to the Serbs as a gift,' he says to the camera. Another video playing in court showed Mladic addressing a bus full of Muslims, telling them: 'Good afternoon. You heard stories about me for a very long time. Now you are looking at me. 'I am General Mladic. There are able-bodied people among you. You are all safe and you are all going to be transported to Kladanj. We wish you a safe journey. And Good-bye. 'Take care. You who are of a military age, don't go to the front again! No more forgiveness. Now I am giving you your life as a gift.' Another prosecutor Dermot Groome said that by the time Gen Mladic and his troops had 'murdered thousands in Srebrenica', they were 'well-rehearsed in the craft of murder'. Mr McCloskey outlined how, after overrunning Srebrenica, Mladic's forces summoned buses and trucks from across Bosnia to transport women and girls out of the enclave. The men and boys were then driven to remote locations and gunned down by firing squads, their bodies ploughed into mass graves. Salute: Ratko Mladic (right) pays tribute to his troops in the east Bosnian town of Vlasenica in 1995 . Trial: Dubbed the 'Butcher of Bosnia', Mladic is charged with masterminding atrocities that left 100,000 dead . Evidence: Bosnian Muslim forensic experts unearth bodies of victims of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre in 2004 . He said the remains - sometimes no more than a couple of bones - of 5,977 victims have been exhumed so far. He showed photographs of an exposed mass grave to underscore the point that the victims were not war casualties. One photo showed a skull, its teeth exposed and its eyes covered by a blindfold.

But as Serbia's goal of integration with Europe overtook its defiance, he lost his comfortable protection. And by the end he was reduced to sheltering, penniless and sick, in a cousin's farmhouse. The son of a World War Two partisan fighter killed in 1945, Mladic was an officer in the old communist Yugoslav Federal Army (JNA) when Yugoslavia's disintegration began in 1991. When Serbs rose up in 1992 against Bosnia's Muslim-led secession, he was picked to command the army that swiftly overran 70 per cent of the country. It was a model of ruthlessness, daring and brutality in the Serb warrior tradition once prized in the life-or-death struggle against Nazi Germany. But NATO officers who dealt soldier-to-soldier with Mladic when UN evenhandedness was official policy later came to regret shaking his hand.

A controversial payday loan company paid £1,500 per head for tickets to meet Government ministers at a ‘speed dating’ event. Representatives of Wonga.com – accused of operating as ‘legal loan sharks’ and preying on those in financial difficulty – are said to have enjoyed ‘cosy meetings’ with ministers. The event, which was also attended by corporate giants such as Aviva, Barclays and PricewaterhouseCoopers, was held in a ballroom in Birmingham during the Conservative party conference. Pay day loan firm Wonga was among the companies who paid to meet ministers at the Tory party conference . According to one witness, eight firms sat at a table with a minister for 20 minutes before moving on to the next table where another minister was seated. It is understood that Michael Fallon, the enterprise minister, David Gauke, the Treasury’s exchequer secretary, and Sajid Javid, its economic secretary, were at the meeting. Their attendance was not confirmed by the Conservative party, which insisted it was a ‘private event’. Last night there was criticism of the decision to allow Wonga.com, which charges annual interest rates of up to 4,200 per cent, to buy access to ministers at a time when it is facing a major investigation into its activities by the Office of Fair Trading. Labour MP Stella Creasy said the debate over payday loans should be transparent. She said: ‘Cosy chats with a minister at conference are bad. Public debate about the issues is good.’ Wonga gives loans of up to £1,000 to customers after only 15 minutes. The average amount is £255. Last year, as the firm benefited from customers’ financial troubles, the number of loans it handed out rocketed by nearly 300 per cent to 2.5million. Labour MP Stella Creasy said the debate over payday loans should be transparent . In February, the Office of Fair Trading began an inquiry into the payday loan industry amid fears that it may be ‘taking advantage of people in financial difficulty’. Last night, a Government spokesman said: ‘All political parties regularly meet with business people. The Government is working with the industry and consumer organisations to ensure that government regulation provides people with the right protections. ‘It is essential for good regulation that ministers and others meet with and listen to the views of the businesses they regulate as well as those who campaign for tougher measures.’ A Wonga.com spokesman said: ‘The conference was attended by many of the UK’s leading businesses. ‘Of course we engage with the Government, as do most companies in the UK.’ It emerged yesterday the Labour party held its own ‘Business Forum’ during its annual party conference in Manchester for a price of £1,550 per person for a full week’s pass. Business leaders could have breakfast with leader Ed Miliband, and spend the rest of the day with his shadow cabinet team, including round table discussions. The day ended with a two-hour business reception with Mr Miliband and his Treasury team, including the Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls. Wonga.com did not attend the Labour event. Earlier this month, Wonga.com signed a deal to become the new sponsor of Premier League Newcastle United, its third football sponsorship deal. Local MPs criticised the deal as an ‘utter disgrace’ because the North East is Britain’s personal insolvency capital. Yesterday, the debt advice charity, the Consumer Credit Counselling Service, said it has seen a ‘dramatic’ rise in the number of people with multiple payday loans seeking help. Between January and June, 2,015 of those who sought help had five or more payday loans, averaging a total of around £1,500. For the whole of 2009, there were just 716 such requests for help.","'Speed dating' sessions held at Conservative conference to boost party coffers .

After studying music and English . at Bangor University, Mr Fox is now half-way through a fortnight long stint . scaring partridges from a field of oilseed rape near Aylsham, Norfolk. Field of dreams: University graduate Jamie Fox is working as a human scarecrow to save up for a trip to New Zealand . Dedicated Jamie, who reaps a reward of £250 a week for his efforts, leaps into action when birds begin to circle, scaring them off with his bright orange coat as he makes a terrible racket with his accordion and cow bell. Mr Fox said he enjoys being out in the fresh air and, while some friends are bemused by his new job, others are envious. Perks: Jamie Fox, pictured after graduating from Bangor University, says he enjoys the fresh air . He said: 'I get to sit and read for a lot of the time, but whenever the partridges appear I have to get up and scare them off. 'I ring a cowbell and I’ve even played the accordion, but the ukulele doesn’t seem to have any effect on them. 'It’s nice to be out in the fresh air but it can get very cold when the wind whips across the land and I have to take shelter in a wood when it rains. It’s not a bad job - and a couple of chums in busier more generously-paid jobs are slightly envious.' Mr Fox, who lives in Aylsham, polices the 10-acre field for eight hours each day and is saving for a planned trip to New Zealand next year. He added: 'I don’t want to be a scarecrow forever but it is giving me time to decide what I will do with my future.' Farmer William Youngs employed Mr Fox because conventional birdscarers had not worked. He said: 'I have tried everything else to keep birds off my fields of young oilseed rape.

They have always been seen as a nation of lovers, happy to give in to their passions and turn a blind eye to the indiscretions of others. But the latest revelations about the sexual goings-on at the top of their political establishment have shattered the usual French sangfroid. It emerged yesterday that the First Lady, Valerie Trierweiler, had been at the centre of an astonishing ‘menage a six’. Love triangle: French first lady Valerie Trierweiler (centre)  was the shared . mistress of future Socialist president Francois Hollande (left)  and right wing . politician Patrick Devedjian (right) A less-scandalous trio: Mr Hollande, centre, pictured with rock star Bono, left, and Microsoft boss Bill Gates today at the Elysee Palace. the president is trying hard to ignore the growing scandal surrounding him . Miss Trierweiler, it was revealed, had . been the shared mistress of Francois Hollande, now the country’s . Socialist president, and  a married conservative minister, Patrick . Devedjian. Not only that, but she was still married to her husband at the time. And more controversially still, Mr . Hollande was at the time living with Segolene Royal, the mother of his . four children and a senior Socialist politician in her own right. This is the first time that details of . 47-year-old Miss Trierweiler’s passionate affair with Right-winger Mr . Devedjian, now 68, have been made public. She was sleeping with Mr Devedjian at the same time as seeing Left-winger Mr Hollande, now 58. Miss Trierweiler frequently asked Mr . Devedjian, who is still a senior member of the opposition UMP coalition, . to leave his wife of more than 30 years for her, and when he refused . she concentrated her affections on Mr Hollande. Victoire: Francois Hollande celebrates his election win with Valerie Trierweiler earlier this year. She has since become one of the most unpopular first ladies in recent history . Incredibly, Mr Devedjian and Mr . Hollande both knew they were sleeping with the same mistress, and . developed ‘a great respect for each other’. Details of the complicated affairs are . contained in La Frondeuse (The Rebellious One), an unauthorised . biography of Miss  Trierweiler by the French political writers . Christophe Jakubyszyn and Alix Bouilhaguet, which comes out today. They were also publicised across . France yesterday, with respected newspapers  including Le Figaro and . broadcasters carrying the story. In an interview with French magazine . Point Of View, Mr Jakubyszyn said Mr Devedjian and Miss Trierweiler . enjoyed ‘an intimate relationship which lasted a number of years. At the . time, both of them were married. They hesitated in making the big jump, . to change their life. ‘Patrick Devedjian dilly-dallied so . much that Valerie Trierweiler was left to be seduced by a second  man . from another political side – Francois Hollande.’ Mr Jakubyszyn, who also presents a . political programme on French television, said that ‘little by little, . the relationship with Hollande took over the other one’. In 2003 Miss Trierweiler gave Mr . Devedjian ‘an ultimatum’ to leave his wife, Sophie, an army general’s . daughter with whom he has four children. But Mr Devedjian ‘would not . give in’ and leave Sophie,  whom he had married in 1969, said Mr . Jakubyszyn. Miss Trierweiler was at the time . married to her second husband, her fellow Paris Match magazine . journalist Denis Trierweiler, with whom she has three sons. The Trierweiler divorce was not . applied for until 2007, before being sealed in 2010, meaning Miss . Trierweiler would effectively have been seeing at least three men at one . stage. Mr Jakubyszyn said that Mr Hollande . and Mr Devedjian – who he said ‘maintained a great respect  for each . other’ – were at one stage general secretaries of their respective . parties. France's former president Nicolas Sarkozy divorced for the second time and then married Carla Bruni, the former supermodel turned pop singer who had admitted that 'monogamy bores me' Miss Trierweiler, who was a political . affairs reporter while sleeping with the two men, would have accordingly . been party to some intriguing pillow talk from across the political . spectrum. Mr Hollande did not ‘officially’ break up with Miss Royal until after she unsuccessfully ran for the presidency in 2007. The pair regularly paraded themselves . as a couple up until this year, but it is now clear that Mr Hollande had . taken Miss Trierweiler as a mistress many years before. Mr Devedjian is a close personal . friend of Nicolas Sarkozy, the conservative UMP president who was . defeated by Mr Hollande in the May presidential election. Since then, Miss Trierweiler – . nicknamed ‘Valerie Rottweiler’ and ‘First Concubine’ by the French media . – has become one of the most unpopular first ladies in recent history. In June, she sent a Twitter message . encouraging voters to support a rival to Miss Royal in parliamentary . elections. Miss Royal went on to lose the election and since then . neither she, nor her four children with Mr Hollande, have spoken to Miss . Trierweiler, accusing her of a ‘stab in the back’. The mutual loathing between Miss Royal . and Miss Trierweiler is regularly highlighted in the French media, . especially because Mr Hollande’s live-in lover has her own office at the . grand presidential Elysee Palace, while Miss Royal does not even have a . parliamentary seat. A lawyer for Miss Trierweiler last . night said she was planning to sue the authors of the book for breaking . France’s strict privacy laws, and for defamation. There was no specific . denial of any of the allegations contained in La Frondeuse, but her . barrister Frederique Giffard instead said that the entire book was a . collection of ‘author assertions backed by unproven rumours’, all aimed . at ‘maliciously tarnishing’ Miss Trierweiler and her family. A spokesman for the Elysee  Palace said that Mr Hollande  would not be taking legal action over the book. Mr Devedjian said he ‘firmly condemns’ what is written in the book, but has yet to make up his mind about legal action. Nicolas Sarkozy allegedly paid his friends to carry out surveys on his wife Carla Bruni . Nicolas Sarkozy was at the centre of a £7.6million corruption inquiry yesterday after allegedly paying friends to carry out surveys about his wife Carla Bruni with taxpayers’ money. Mr Sarkozy, 57, tried to block an investigation into the scandal when he was French president, but lost his immunity on leaving office in May. Anticor, the anti-corruption association, claims that he spent  €9.4million (£7.6million) on hundreds of polls mainly centred on Miss Bruni, asking how the then First Lady was viewed by the  public. Anticor claims there was no public interest in any of the polls and the taxpayer should not have paid for them. It has lodged a complaint of ‘embezzlement’ with Paris prosecutors, an offence which could see Mr Sarkozy imprisoned. Mr Sarkozy strongly denies any wrong-doing.","France's First Lady had affair with arch right-winger Patrick Devedjian .

Alexandra Kogut had been carrying on a long distance relationship with Clayton S Whittemore, 21, after she went to school at the College at Brockport near Rochester, New York, 150 miles away from their hometown of New Hartford. Police say Whittemore admitted to battering his girlfriend, whom he had been dating for about a year, after he was arrested at a rest stop between Brockport and New Hartford. The Utica Observer-Dispatch reports . exchanged dozens of messages with each other over Twitter. Most were . playful and affectionate. 'So excited for @Whittemore21 to come . to Brockport Saturday and bring me half moons,' she tweeted to her . boyfriend in early September, according to the newspaper. 'Not if I eat them all first yummm,' Whittemore responded. 'You better not eat my half moons or tomato pie!!!!' was her retort. 'Half moon' is another name for black and white cookies. Kogut and Whittemore lived in New . Hartford, in central New York about two and a half hours east of . Brockport, and attended the same high school. Kogut's childhood friend Mary Kate .

Kogut gave no hint of trouble as the group shopped . and saw 'Phantom of the Opera' on Broadway in New York City, she said. 'She was texting him throughout the whole trip,' Heaton said. Friends of Kogut rallied fellow students on Monday to wear purple to raise domestic violence awareness. Kogut's family released a photo of her along with a statement asking for privacy. 'Alexandra Kogut was a bright, . beautiful young woman who was thrilled to be beginning her college . education,' the family said. 'Her lovely and sweet demeanor was truly . infectious and she will forever be missed.'

School shock: Whittemore is not enrolled at SUNY Brockport, but his girlfriend was a student at the school . The cause of death was ruled blunt . force trauma, Helfer said, but he declined to say whether a weapon was . used.

Home Secretary Theresa May revealed free movement between EU member states is under review . Border controls could be introduced to block European immigrants flocking to Britain, Theresa May revealed today. The Home Secretary unveiled the dramatic proposal which will be seen as a direct challenge to one of the central principles of the European Union. The freedom of movement directive, which allows 500million people to move freely between member states, is under now review as part of a study into Britain’s relationship with Brussels. Europe is likely to dominate much of the Tory party conference in Birmingham this week, with David Cameron vowing to block any ‘outrageous’ increases in the EU budget from 2014. Ms May expressed concern at an expanding EU and work restrictions on migrants from Romania and Bulgaria being lifted from next year. William Hague, the foreign secretary, is carrying out a strategic review of the UK’s relationship with the EU which Eurosceptics hope will lead to the renegotiation and repatriation of significant powers. Ms May revealed it would look at immigration controls. ‘We are looking at this whole area of the abuse of the freedom of movement. But we will go further on this, and the issue of free movement will be part of the review,’ she told the Sunday Times. ‘It will be looking at where the decision-making powers are between the EU and the UK, how they are operating and what the impact of those are. ‘That will then enable us to have a good evidence base on which to look at these issues. ‘I was very clear that we wanted to make sure the free movement of persons was in that because I think it is an important issue that we need to look at.’ Visas could be introduced for migrants from some countries while others will be able to come to Britain freely. However, it would mark a major challenge to the free movement of people which is one of the four ‘fundamental freedoms’ enshrined in the EU’s founding treaty in 1957.","Home Secretary Theresa May says a review of Britain's relationship with Europe will examine free movement between member states .

Andrew Flintoff is preparing to be granted a licence to fight by boxing authorities as he reinvents himself as a professional heavyweight boxer. The former English cricket captain showed off a new muscly physique with his transformation almost complete as the British Boxing Board of Control considered Flintoff's case after a rigorous testing process. The 34-year-old,  who had not fought at . any level before an impromptu sparring session with Barry McGuigan last . year, has given up alcohol and lost more than . two stone in weight after 10 weeks of full-time training under boxing . legend McGuigan and his son Shane. Lean and mean: Andrew Flintoff poses in the boxing ring ahead of his first bout on November 30 . The Board are just waiting on elements of the medical before they sanction his professional debut. A November 30 date at Manchester Arena has been mooted, although an opponent has not yet been decided. Once one of English cricket's most . popular and charismatic characters, it was Flintoff's various brushes . with the sport's authorities and a raffish persona that always endeared . him to the England fans. Training: Flintoff has given up drinking and has shed more than two stone . Retiring: Plagued by injury, when Flintoff quit cricket he said: 'I love playing Test cricket, but the decision has been made for me - I don't think I've been left with any other choices' He famously lost the England vice-captaincy after getting into difficulties in a pedalo after heavy drinking - instantly immortalised in the tabloids as 'Fredalo' -  following a defeat to New Zealand in the Caribbean in 2007. He was also forced to apologise to team-mates after missing part of a squad-bonding trip to Flanders. Training: Flintoff has given up drinking . He failed to board the bus taking captain Andrew Strauss and the other players on a tour of First World War trenches - sparking speculation he had drunk too much at the previous evening's private dinner. When he retired from cricket, he said: 'I love playing Test cricket, but the decision has been made for me - I don't think I've been left with any other choices. 'I've not been playing Test cricket very often over the last few years so it's bitterly disappointing but it's something I've not been doing very often anyway. 'It's also important for the team that I make this announcement because they need to move on.' Flintoff . has stayed active since quitting cricket in 2010 because of injury, . mainly to an ankle and both shoulders. He has cycled from Athens to . London and rowed the channel among a host of . charity challenges . His current weight is understood to be . under 16 stone, with a desired fighting weight in the region of . 15-and-a-half stone, which would leave him on the lean side for a 6ft . 4in heavyweight. His . decision to enter the ring has drawn a mixed response in the boxing . community, with promoter Frank Warren suggesting Flintoff is too old to . start life as a pro fighter. David Price, the British and Commonwealth heavyweight champion, insists Flintoff is only justified in fighting if his motives are genuine. Bowing out: Flintoff in action on the cricket pitch at the Oval in 2009 . He said in September: 'Freddie’s as entitled as anyone to try it out and some people come to professional boxing later in life but if it’s just some type of PR stunt then it’s disrespectful to boxing. 'The reality is he could get hurt if there’s someone in front of him who’ll stand up and throw punches back. 'It’s car crash TV but will probably get people watching.' Flintoff said: ‘It’s an opportunity I couldn’t pass up. 'I played my last game of cricket at the age of 31 and I’m only 34 now. 'I’ve always loved boxing and I’m going to have a go at it and see where it takes us. 'When you put yourself out there you put yourself up for a bit of criticism, but I’m not bothered. 'The people who criticise, what are they are doing? Criticising is easy to do.’ Flintoff retired from Test cricket in July 2009 following an 11-year England career.","Andrew 'Freddie' Flintoff due to be granted a licence to fight by the British Boxing Board of Control .

A rugby player has accused police officers of trying to hack the phone he had used to record them taking a break - locking it for a staggering 42 years. Management trainee Jake Coplestone, 20, used his mobile phone to record footage of five officers outside a bar and coffee shop. But he was then approached by two of the officers who accused him of being drunk and disorderly and put him in handcuffs. The Newbury RFC player was arrested and spent the night in a police cell before being released - without his iPhone. But when the handset was returned five days later it had a screen message stating: 'iPhone is disabled, try again in 22,461,058 minutes' - more than four decades. He claims this was due to the handset being tampered with repeatedly in a crude effort to crack the password. But Mr Coplestone, who played rugby for a south-west England under-16 squad, was able to retrieve the  51-second video and show it to The Mail on Sunday. Police have referred the incident to their professional standards department but say the officers involved refute Mr Coplestone’s claims. But Jake, of Marlborough, Wiltshire, said: 'The only logical explanation for my phone being disabled for 42 years is that someone had been trying to access my files to delete the video footage of officers in the club. 'I was not drunk and disorderly and I believe the only reason for my arrest was my taking footage of the officers standing at the bar. 'I’m discussing what to do, including court action and a complaint to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, with my solicitor.' Recalling the incident, Mr Coplestone and one of his friends said he was approached by the officers who had seen him filming. The friends say the officers discussed whether to arrest 6ft 5in Mr Coplestone under Section 60 of the Public Order Act, then decided on ‘drunk and disorderly’ after he protested. At this point, Mr Coplestone says he was seized by one of the officers and led off to a car park behind the Azuza venue just off Marlborough High Street where police patrol vehicles were parked. Mr Coplestone says he was handcuffed and bundled into a vehicle and taken to the custody suite at Swindon. There, he claims he repeatedly asked to be breathalysed to prove that he was not drunk but that was refused. Wiltshire Police policy is to offer breathalyser tests only to drink-driving suspects.Instead, he says, he was put in a cell overnight and released the next day. Mr Coplestone says his mobile phone was returned five days later – after the intervention of his solicitor and on condition he paid an £80 fixed penalty – but it was blocked. With help from a software programme ironically named Jail Break, he was able to unlock the phone and retrieve the film. Azuza: Jake Coplestone filmed officers apparently having a break in the Wiltshire bar and cafe while on duty . Chief Superintendent Paul Mills, Head of Local Policing, said in a statement: ‘No formal complaint has been made and the Force have not seen the alleged footage. 'However, due to the serious allegations being made by Jacob Coplestone, this will now be subject to an investigation by the Force Professional Standards Department who are responsible for the oversight of all conduct matters attaining to police officers and staff.’ Ch Supt Mills said records showed Mr Coplestone chose to pay the fixed penalty rather than have the matter heard in court. Mr Coplestone’s allegations, if upheld, will add to the Wiltshire force’s tarnished reputation. The IPCC is already investigating failures in the case of murdered Becky Godden. Taxi driver Christopher Halliwell couldn’t be tried for the crime, even though he confessed, as detectives had denied him his rights under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. Last year Deputy Chief Constable David Ainsworth, 49, hanged himself after 13 female staff made 26 separate complaints against him of inappropriate sexual advances.","Jake Coplestone was arrested after filming officers on his phone apparently having a coffee break in Wiltshire's Azuza bar .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 07:41 EST, 22 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:52 EST, 22 October 2012 . A photograph of a 93-year-old World War II veteran casting what will likely be his last ballot has captured the hearts of tens of thousands of Internet users. The photo shows Frank Tanabe lying in a hospital bed at home as his daughter Barbara Tanabe helps him fill out his absentee ballot. Half a million people saw the picture on the website Reddit after his grandson posted it there on Thursday, making it one of the most popular items on the social media network for a day after. Patriotism: Veteran Frank Tanabe, who has terminal cancer, fills out his absentee ballot from hospital bed in Honolulu with the help of his daughter Barbara (left) and wife Setsuko (right) 'True Patriotism,' was the top rated comment on the post. 'This is America. Amen,' was next, followed by 'Thank you, Citizen.' Doctors diagnosed Tanabe with an inoperable cancer tumor in his liver two months ago. He's been in hospice care for the past three weeks at his daughter's home. His condition has been deteriorating, and he's been speaking little lately. He's been determined to vote regardless, eagerly asking when the ballot would be arriving in the mail, his daughter said. She kept telling him, 'don't worry, it's coming'. He filled it out immediately when it landed in the mailbox on Wednesday. Barbara Tanabe read aloud the names of the candidates to her dad. He either nodded 'yes' to the names or shook his head 'no.' She filled in the boxes on his behalf, following his instructions even when he didn't pick the people she wanted. 'There were some that were OK, but there were others where I said, ''Dad, are you sure?'"" she said. But he knew what he was doing. He's kept up on the issues, reading newspapers regularly until only recently, she said. Tanabe volunteered to join the Army from behind barbed wire at the Tule Lake internment camp in California. Protect and serve: Frank Tanabe, a Japanese-American, was placed in an internment camp before serving in military intelligence during the Second World War . Pride: Frank Tanabe holds a replica of the Congressional Gold Medal in Washington, D.C., awarded collectively to Japanese-American veterans of World War II, including those who served in his unit, the Military Intelligence Service . He was pulled out of college at the University of Washington and taken to the camp when President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered 110,000 Japanese-Americans detained and isolated after the start of the war with Japan. The Army assigned Tanabe to the Military Intelligence Service, a classified unit whose members were collectively awarded the Congressional Gold Medal last year along with soldiers who served in the 100th Infantry Battalion and 442nd Regimental Combat Team - highly decorated segregated units of mostly Japanese-Americans. 'I'd like to accept on behalf of all hyphenated Americans, including American-Americans,' Tanabe told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser at the time. 'We all served together in defense of our country.' Noah Tanabe, the grandson who posted the photo online, said he thinks about his grandfather every time he votes. Tradition: Frank Tanabe as a baby with his mother Katsuko Okamoto Tanabe . 'It's hard to imagine - after his . family business is torched, his family imprisoned, and denied the . opportunity to finish his college education - he volunteered to serve. I . don't know if I would have done the same thing, but we are all very . proud of him,' he said. The family has been surprised and gratified by the online comments on the photo, Barbara Tanabe said. 'I . think he feels like joining the Army, going to the camp, fighting in . the war, and fighting discrimination - these were all things he did so . that we have this precious right to vote,' she said. 'For so many people to express their heartfelt tribute to my father was really, really heartwarming for us.' Several Reddit commentators asked whether Tanabe's vote would be counted if he passed away before Election Day on November 6. Glenn Takahashi, Honolulu election . administrator, said absentee ballots cast by voters who later die become . invalid if the state Department of Health notifies elections officials . of the death before Election Day. To . void a ballot when that happens, officials have to be able to sort . through tens of thousands of ballots to find the one in question. This . is not always practical, and so the ballot is counted if it isn't. Brothers in arms: Veterans from the 100th Infantry Battalion and 442nd Regimental Combat Team all received the Congressional Gold Medal last year for their bravery . A similar situation arose in Honolulu four years ago when President Barack Obama's grandmother died two nights before the election but after she mailed her absentee ballot. Hawaii counted her vote anyway because the Health Department didn't receive her certificate of death before the election. Barbara Tanabe said her father, a quiet, unassuming man, would wonder what the fuss over the photo was about. But he'd be thrilled it encouraged others to vote, she said. 'That would be the ultimate honor for him,' she said.","Frank Tanabe, 93, filled in absentee ballot with the help of his daughter from Honolulu hospital .

The alleged victim's spouse confronted Andrew Marsh, now 38, by pretending to plan a surprise party for his wife via the social networking site. Married greengrocer Marsh, of Rochester, Kent, was arrested and charged with raping the woman in an alleyway 10 years ago when she was a schoolgirl and he was 27, after her husband convinced her to finally report the historic alleged rape to police. Maidstone Crown Court heard the . alleged victim - who cannot be named for legal reasons - only entrusted . her husband with the rape claims during a talk about the lack of . intimacy in their relationship. She . told him she had a relationship with Marsh which had started as just . cuddling and kissing after school but ended with him allegedly raping . her against a wall. The . court heard the frightened girl went home and told no-one of the alleged . abuse until she broke down and told her husband last year.

After putting up with ten years of building work by her next-door neighbour, Annie Reed Henderson is at her wits’ end. She says she is so fed up with the failure of her local council to stop the constant noise, mess and disruption outside her £1million house that she plans to stop paying her council tax. And the pensioner is even prepared to go to prison to try to end her nightmare. She fears it could go on for another decade unless action is taken. Mrs Reed Henderson, 67, says the back garden of neighbour John Donaghy’s property has been a permanent builders’ yard since 2002. Annie Reed Henderson (above) said she has endured building work since 2002 at the house next door to her £1m property in Clapham, south London. She is seen here in her back garden . Mrs Reed Henderson, a psychotherapist, has had to put up with a decade of constant noise, mess and disruption . Among the bizarre renovations carried out by developer John Donaghy are an underground cinema and an enormous brick outhouse . All but the facade of the four-bedroom Victorian terrace property has been slowly dismantled and gradually rebuilt. The work has included building an outhouse, sinking a borehole in the back garden, digging out an extension to the basement and putting up new garden walls. It is understood builders have also ripped out the original Victorian features. Mrs Reed Henderson, who works as a psychotherapist, says her complaints to her local council have been ignored. She said: ‘The noise disrupts my therapy sessions. I was assured this work would end years ago and yet it’s still going on. ‘I believe the developers have no intention of finishing this any time soon. It could take them another ten years. I’m at my wits' end. I feel I’ve been let down by the council. Mr Donaghy (left), 54, lives with wife Julie . and their two children in a house near to the renovation property. He said his wife’s advanced breast cancer has prevented him from spending more time finishing the property . Mrs Reed Henderson says her complaints to Wandsworth council have been ignored and is so distraught she has vowed to stop paying her council tax and be taken to court . Work has included building three outhouses, sinking a borehole in the back garden, digging out an extension to the basement and erecting new garden walls . ‘If this is still going on in July, I will stop paying my council tax. I’m prepared to go to court and even prison if that’s what it takes.’ Mrs Reed Henderson, who has also worked as a model and advertising executive, has spent £30,000 on solicitors’ and surveyors’ fees to try to bring an end to the development. But after making multiple complaints to the council about the property, she has been informed that officials have no power to force a developer to finish a job and that work could go on indefinitely. Every day, a team of up to nine workmen toil at the house. Builders’ vans frequently block the tree-lined suburban street 200 yards from Clapham Common in south London. The developers have slowly dismantled all but the facade of the four-bedroom Victorian terrace property and started to rebuild it. Above, Mrs Reed Henderson outside her neighbour's home . Mrs Reed Henderson suspects the site is being used as a workshop for other business projects. Other neighbours complain that the house has become an eyesore and that skips filled with rubbish are left outside it for weeks at a time. Mrs Reed Henderson moved into her home with her then husband Mark nearly 40 years ago and they raised two children before divorcing ten years ago. Developer Mr Donaghy, 54, who lives nearby with wife Julie and their two children, blamed complicated council planning rules and expensive fees for the length of time the renovations had taken. It is understood builders have also ripped out the original Victorian features and constructed an external wardrobe onto the outside wall . He added that his wife’s advanced breast cancer has prevented him from spending more time finishing the property. ‘My neighbour’s claims are not valid,’ said Mr Donaghy. ‘If they were valid, the council would have done something about them.’ A Wandsworth Council spokesman said: ‘We have a great degree of sympathy for the neighbours, but planning laws do not impose time limits for works to be completed so there are no legal powers that can be used to compel him to do the job quicker. ‘We are also aware that some neighbours are unhappy with materials being stored in his back garden, but as they are required for these works, if we were to ask the owner to move them the whole thing would undoubtedly take even longer to finish.’","Annie Reed Henderson said Wandsworth council has ignored her complaints .

Forest Boy: Ray, who wandered into Berlin after five years of 'living in the woods' This is the first picture of 'Forest Boy' - the English speaking teenager who last September wandered into the city of Berlin saying he had been living for five years in the wilderness with his father. Unable to identify the boy since he emerged in the German capital, Berlin police have issued his picture in a bid to jog people's memory and maybe throw up some leads. Police spokesman Thomas Neuendorf said: 'We've checked his DNA against all missing person reports, sent the data to Interpol so they could check it internationally, but unfortunately without any success.' The boy said his father called him 'Ray' and that he was born June 20, 1994, but claims not to know his last name or where he is from. He said his mother, Doreen, died in a car accident when he was 12 and after that he and his father, Ryan, took to the forest. They wandered using maps and a compass, staying in tents or caves overnight, he added. And he told authorities that after his father died in August 2011, he buried him in the forest and then walked five days north before ending up in Berlin, and showed up at city hall. Investigators have been unable to confirm any details about a fatal car accident that matches up with Ray's story, however, and haven't been able to find the body of the father - raising 'serious doubts' about the story. 'There are many question marks,' Neuendorf added. He . is now being taken care of by youth services, and is going to school. When he first appeared, Ray spoke English and a few words of German, but . has picked up more German fast, Neuendorf said. He has also quickly adapted to city life and technology, using a laptop and his cell phone with no problems. 'Everything gives the impression that he was not far away from civilization for years,' Neuendorf said. Neuendorf said that Ray does not speak . English with a particular accent, leading investigators to believe that . he is not a native speaker. Possessions: Ray's rucksack, which was on him when he was found . Equipment: Ray (right) was carrying this sleeping bag (left) when he wandered into Berlin . There are no indications, however, of what his native tongue might be.  Ray is described as being somewhere between 16-20 years old and 180cm (about 5ft 11in) tall. He has dark blonde hair and blue eyes, and three small scars on his forehead, three small scars on his chin and a small scar on his right arm. He has a complete set of teeth and no obvious dental work, and his hands, fingernails and teeth appear 'well kept'. Police in Berlin have asked anyone with information on him to contact them.

"By . Ian Garland and Beth Stebner . UPDATED: . 01:02 EST, 23 June 2012 . The search for Amelia Earhart is now relying on 21st century technology – using underwater robots to search areas of the ocean where the famous female pilot could have crashed. The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (or TIGHAR) will enlist two robot submersibles and additional sonar to do what U.S. Navy warships could not – find the ruins of Earhart’s plane. The underwater robots, which are . capable of capturing images up to a depth of 5,000 feet, will be . launched on July 2, marking the 75th anniversary of Earhart’s . disappearance. Enduring riddle: American avirator Amelia Earhart, posing by her plane in Long Beach, California, in 1930, disappeared while flying over the Pacific in 1937 . New technology: The expedition plans to deploy two robot submersibles like this one to search the reef where Earhart's ship is believed to have crashed . But this mission will be for mapping purposes only. Any recovery efforts will be undertaken later. TIGHAR’s executive director Richard Gillespie explained: ‘The objective is to get imagery and photographs of what’s there.’ Captivating: Earhart's story has mystified generations . Mr Gillespie told Discovery that any . promising images could lead to more expeditions. ‘If there’s wreckage . there that can be recovered,’ he told Discovery News, ‘we need to know what it is, how . big it is, what it looks like, and what it’s made of so we can prepare a . recovery expedition that has equipment to raise whatever’s there.’ He added that conservation is key. The research team will set off for the . remote island of Nikumaroro to try and establish what happened to the . legendary pilot after she vanished on July 2 1937. It's the tenth time in 23 years TIGHAR . will have searched the island for clues about Earhart's disappearance - . but this time they'll be looking specifically for crash debris. Earhart, then 39, was on the final stage of an an ambitious round-the-world flight along the equator in a twin-engine Lockheed Electra when she and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared. The holder of several aeronautical records, including the first woman to cross the Atlantic by air, Earhart had set off from New Guinea to refuel at Howland Island for a final long-distance hop to California. In what turned out to be her final radio message, she declared she was unable to find Howland and that fuel was running low. Plan of attack: A 1937 British expedition photo may show the landing gear assembly from Amelia Earhart's airplane; the 2012 expedition will be looking for plane debris . What lies beneath: The expedition will search the gentle slope off of Nikumaroro Island . Several search-and-rescue missions . ordered by then-president Franklin Roosevelt turned up no trace of . Earhart or Noonan, who were eventually presumed dead at sea. Conspiracy theories flourished. One contended that Earhart was held by Japanese imperial forces as a spy. Another claimed she completed her flight, but changed her identity and settled in New Jersey. TIGHAR is working on the hypothesis that the duo reached Gardner Island, then a British possession and now known as Nikumaroro, and managed to survive for an unknown period of time. Nikumaroro, uninhabited in Earhart's time, and a mere 3.7 miles (six kilometers) long by 1.2 miles (two kilometers) wide, is about 300 miles (480 kilometers) southeast of Howland Island. Missing: Earhart and Fred Noonan, left, before they set off on their doomed flight. Right: Earhart as a young pilot . Nikumaroro Island: Researchers will scour the island for clues and crash debris . This year's TIGHAR expedition will see about 20 scientists depart Hawaii to explore over 10 days both the island and an underwater reef slope at the west end of the island. 'This time, we'll be searching for debris . from the aircraft,' TIGHAR's founder and executive director Richard . Gillespie, himself a pilot and former aviation accident investigator, revealed. They will be equipped with a multi-beam sonar to map the ocean floor, plus a remote-controlled device similar to the one that found the black boxes from the Rio-to-Paris Air France that crashed into the South Atlantic in 2009. If debris is found, it will be photographed and its location carefully documented for a future expedition, Gillespie said. Sustaining the search are clues . worthy of detective story, including items from the 1930s previously . discovered on the island such as a jar of face cream, a penknife blade, . the heel of a woman's shoe and a bit of Plexiglas. Skeletons of birds apparently cooked over a campfire have also contributed to the mystery, and settlers who reached Nikumaroro after 1937 have spoken of the existence of aircraft wreckage. Bone fragments have meanwhile been subjected to DNA testing that turned out to be inconclusive, said Gillespie, who remains hopeful that parts of Earhart's Electra remain to be found. The US government is lending technical and diplomatic support to the TIGHAR effort, budgeted at $2 million and otherwise privately funded. A documentary is due to be broadcast on the Discovery cable television channel. Celebrated: Earhart posing in Southampton after completing a successful flight . Intrigue: In her day, Earhart was extremely popular, but her mysterious death has kept that fame alive more than 75 years later . The most widely accepted theory is that the aeroplane ran out of fuel and ditched in the sea. There have been several searches by many different professionals eager to solve the mystery, but none have been proven. Another popular theory is that they landed on the island of Nikumaroro in the Pheonix Islands, 350 miles southeast of Howland Island and fended for themselves for serveral months until they succumbed to injury or disease.

An Australian aircraft engineer said he found a map that showed Earhart and Noonan may have turned round to try and refuel but crashed before getting to an airstrip. The most whacky theory is that she was still alive and had a different identity.

An 11-year-old boy died after suffering a suspected allergic reaction to nuts during a Father's Day takeaway meal, it was revealed today. Ethan Thomas was enjoying a curry with his police officer father Rod and mother Judith when he collapsed at the family home in Loughborough, Leicestershire. The youngster was given an injection of adrenaline using the epiPen he carried as an emergency treatment for anaphylaxis - an extreme allergic reaction - and rushed to hospital. Ethan Thomas, 11, who died on Father's Day after a suspected allergic reaction to nuts. He leaves behind a twin brother . But despite the best efforts of doctors, Ethan lost his fight for life. Now his parents, who had been aware their son had a nut allergy since he was six, are speaking out about the tragedy in order to raise awareness of anaphylaxis. Rod and Judith, a police support worker, told how they ordered Ethan’s favourite takeaway curry - a dish they had ordered many times before from the same restaurant - on Father's Day last June. However, Ethan, who has a twin brother, Tri, fell ill within minutes of taking a few mouthfuls. His mum administered the epiPen injection, and paramedics managed to revive him, but it was not enough to save Ethan. Rod, 42, a detective constable with Leicestershire Police, said: 'I do quite a lot of the shopping and always checked all the labels for signs of food containing nuts or traces of nuts. 'We were warned that if Ethan came into contact with just a small amount of nuts, it could kill him. 'We always checked in restaurants, particularly abroad, whether the food contained any nuts. 'The meal we had on Father’s Day was his favourite. We’d had it many times before. 'We’re not blaming anyone for what happened, we just want to make people more aware. 'If children have epiPens, make sure they always carry them. It didn’t help Ethan, but they do save lives, so carry it always.' Tragedy: Ethan collapsed at home and later died in hospital. Now his parents are speaking out to urge others to be careful with allergies . Judith, 41, a support worker with Leicestershire Police, said: 'At the moment, we’re going from day to day. 'Tri is back at school and we’re back at work. We're trying to keep up a normal routine. 'Sundays are hard - it was the day Ethan got his biggest dinner and he loved his food. He wanted to be a chef like his uncle. 'He had a hilarious sense of humour. People loved him, he was so funny. An EpiPen, used to administer a potentially life-saving shot when someone is hit by anaphylaxis . She added: 'We urge parents not to take chances. If they think their child may be allergic to nuts, get it checked. 'If you’re eating in a restaurant, be persistent. Make them tell you what's in it, mark it down when they take the order and ask them to make sure knives which may have been used with nut products are cleaned.' Ethan had just returned from his first school trip away without Tri who, when they were together, made sure his twin brother did not eat anything which could harm him. Rod is now running a half-marathon in London this month in aid of the Anaphylaxis Campaign, a charity which raises awareness of severe allergies and supports people affected by them. He has so far raised more than £2,000 in online donations. Police colleagues, who completed a 170-mile bike ride between Morecambe Bay and Bridlington last month, collected about £500 for the charity in Ethan's memory and two of his aunts raised £700 in a 'trekathon' around London.

"By . Eddie Wrenn . PUBLISHED: . 04:36 EST, 20 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:22 EST, 20 August 2012 . One of the first major studies of 'Flying Ant Day' has revealed that the nuisance outbreaks can occur anytime in the space of a month. The Society of Biology asked members of the public to cover their mouths and keep a record each time they saw the pesky insects take to the air in their annual battle to find a mate. Adam Hart, an ecologist and insect expert at the University of Gloucestershire, led the call to arms, and discovered that the outbreaks could come anytime over the period of a month. It was previously assumed the ants synchronised their swarms to increase their reproductive chances, but instead of the 'Friday night' approach, is appears there is a more complex pattern at play. Swarming: The most common flying ants seen at the moment is the black garden ant, Lasius niger . More than 4,000 people responded to the survey across June and July, and their sightings reveal that even within a small town can have outbreaks on different days. Hart told The Scientist: 'It’s really too early to tell but even a . casual glance at the data so far shows that flying ant emergence is a . spatially and temporally complex event. 'The data so far . suggest that there certainly isn’t a single ‘flying ant day,’ even . within the same small town.' The outbreaks occur when male ants and females - potential queens - head to the skies to find a partner. By far the most common flying ants . seen at the moment is the black garden ant, Lasius niger. The ants we . see throughout the year are workers (sterile females), but flying ants . are males and new queens undergoing their nuptial flight. Sadly for the males, they die soon after, while the females go on to build new colonies. Swarming: The most common flying ants seen at the moment is the black garden ant, Lasius niger . Queens . can live for around 10-15 years and only mate once. Having mated, a new . queen will drop her wings then start her own colony. Once . she has dug a nest she will lay her first eggs, and use her wing . muscles for energy until the first workers are ready to forage. Over the . next few years she will keep laying eggs and her colony will typically . reach 5,000 workers, but some grow to have 15,000. Hart added: 'These sorts of large scale data can only be collected if . you have a large number of observers, and this means that a ""citizen . science"" approach is the ideal method. 'I was surprised to get quite so many . responses from the public and quite so much press and media attention. 'So far this has led to well over 4,000 responses, and this . tally increases daily.' Despite its size, the black garden ant has a huge impact on our countryside, from improving soil to pollination and pest control. They are also important as food; many people are alerted to the presence of flying ants by the sound of feasting gulls. The Society of Biology plans to make this an annual survey, to help understand how and why the timing of emergence changes year on year. Much of what we know about ants comes from experiments which scientists can perform. Collecting information about ant emergences around the UK, however, relies on lots of people submitting their records. The Society of Biology is asking everyone who sees flying ants in 2012 to make a note of the time, date, location and weather conditions, and submit records through an online survey www.societyofbiology.org/flyingantsurvey. Anyone who takes photos of flying ants can share them by emailing Christina Catlin-Groves (flyingants2012@gmail.com), or share on Twitter using the hashtag #flyingantsurvey.

The parents of April Jones have each been tattooed with a pink ribbon as a tribute to their missing daughter. Last week Paul and Coral Jones went to 'friend of the family' and tattoo artist Rob Williams and asked him to create a design incorporating the pink ribbon, which has become a symbol of hope and love adorning the tree-trunks and lamp-posts, shop doorways and homes of Machynlleth, the home town of the five-year-old. Mr Williams, who runs El Diablo tattoo parlour in the town, has since had requests for a similar tattoo from local people. Heartfelt: Mr Williams inks the design for a customer. The parents of April Jones had it inked last week . Ink: The tattoos cost a minimum of £35 and are expected to raise more than £900 for the April Fund . Hope: Tattoo artist Mr Williams inks the design on to the arm of community member Rhys Ap Daffydd . April's parents: Paul and Coral Jones on their wedding day . Missing: April (left) and with her father Paul (right). April went missing while playing near her home in the Bryn Y Gog estate in Machynlleth, Wales . Anyone who wants a similar one can get one for a minimum of £35 per tattoo and all the proceeds will be donated to April’s Fund. The 35-year-old tattoo artist, who has done tattoos for the couple in the past, said: 'When they came in it was very emotional but I gave them both a very special, personalised design, which I will not do for anyone else. 'They have lived around here since I was a lad and a few years ago I lived right by them. 'They did it as a way of permanently remembering April but also of showing that they will never give up searching for her.' Demand is so strong he has had to enlist help from a tattooist in Bangor. So far he has taken 25 bookings for the tattoo and has made £852 for the appeal, with more to come. 'Local people have been massively shaken by this and I think they see having a tattoo as a permanent way to remember April and show that we are remaining positive,' he added. Coral Jones (left) and husband Paul  had the tattoos done last week. The design features the iconic pink ribbon (right) that the town displays as a symbol of unity . Hope: Search teams at work with sniffer dogs on the River Dyfi, Machynlleth, as part of the search for April . As well as professional rescue workers, the town's residents also joined in the huge search effort. April has still not been located . He grew up in the area and has known the family for years. His son goes to the same school as April. April's Fund has now topped £21,000 with contributions flooding in from all over Ceredigion and beyond.

"By . Snejana Farberov . PUBLISHED: . 08:14 EST, 5 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:12 EST, 5 October 2012 . Police have seized a blood-splattered luxury sports car . allegedly tied to the murder of a Chicago area bride who was found dead in the . bathtub just days after her May wedding. The vehicle, a 2006 black Masertai, was discovered in the . garage belonging to the groom's brother after he was arrested on unrelated drug . charges last month. Estrella Carrera, 26, was found stabbed to death in her . Burbank home on May 13, just two days after she married her boyfriend, 30-year-old . Arnaldo Jimenez, in a City Hall ceremony. Tragic: A surveillance image shows Estrella Carrera wearing the silver sequined dress that she was later found in after being stabbed in a bathtub . At the time of her . death, the mother of two was still clad in her silver cocktail dress in which . she had celebrated her nuptials. The victim's new husband, who disappeared after the murder, . was quickly named a suspect, and a federal warrant for first-degree murder was . issued for his arrest. Jimenez was last . seen driving the Masertai en route to Mexico. However, when his brother, 26-year-old Humberto Jimenez, was . taken into custody in connection to a drug ring last month, police discovered . the luxury sedan with Illinois license plate L641441 under a blanket in his garage on Mozart Street, according to ABC7. According to officials, the inside of the vehicle was . covered in blood which someone had apparently tried to clean up. Investigators now believe that Carrera was stabbed in the . car and moved to the bathtub, according to CBS2. Humberto Jimenez then allegedly drove Arnaldo in . the car to La Caldena, Mexico. Evidence: Arnoldo Jimenez's bloodied 2006 black Maserati was found in the garage of his brother, Humberto, after he was arrested on drug charges . Clue: The car was covered with a blanket inside the garage located on Mozart Street in Chicago . 'It's a major part of the investigation, especially in terms . of physical evidence,' said Capt. Joseph Ford. 'All the holes are being patched . and we'll feel more confident once he's arrested.' This theory is supported by wiretapped conversations which . reveal that Humberto Jimenez was with his brother as he fled to the U.S.-Mexico . border. In recordings made a day after Carrera's murder, Arnaldo . Jimenez could be heard telling friends that 'there's an emergency' and a 'huge . problem,' the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Cell phone records allowed police to track Jimenez as far as . Hidalgo, Mexico. There is a $10,000 reward for information leading to the . arrest and prosecution of Arnaldo Jimenez. Ford added that while he is not sure how big of a priority . it is for Mexican police to arrest Jimenez, he said that ‘it will never go . away,’ and that he hopes to be around when the 30-year-old is caught. Humberto Jimenez was among 27 people arrested around the . country on September 27 and charged with drug offenses. A total of 39 . defendants are facing drug charges in the investigation. According to prosecutors, Jimenez and another accused drug . ring leader Jesus Ramirez-Padilla led their own drug-trafficking organizations . that bought and sold powder cocaine on Chicago's southwest side. He has not . been charged in connection with Carrera's murder or his brother's escape. Newlyweds: Police have launched a manhunt for Arnoldo Jimenez (left) who has been charged with stabbing to death his wife, Estrella Carrera (right), just two days after their wedding . The bloodied Maserati car is now in the custody of the . Burbank Police Department. An FBI warrant states . that Jimenez used his cell phone on May 12, a day after his wedding, in . the Chicago area. He continued using it through southern Illinois, near . Memphis, Tennessee, through Arkansas and then into Texas. The warrant also confirms information . that Carrera’s family revealed about an emotional call Jimenez made to . his sister, allegedly telling her that he had left his wife bleeding . after a ‘bad fight.’ Another ‘close associate of Jimenez’ told authorities that Jimenez told him ‘he was leaving the state of . Illinois, and if questioned by law enforcement, the associate should . tell law enforcement he went to Mexico.’ Jimenez . is a Texas native who owns property there in the city of Pharr, . according to the warrant. His parents currently live in Mexico, and he . also has relatives residing in North Carolina. Authorities began looking for Jimenez soon after Carrera's family reported that she failed to pick up her two children, ages two and ten, as she had arranged. The family had been unable to reach Carrera or Jimenez, so they asked police to check on her at her apartment in the suburb of Burbank. That is when the 26-year-old’s body was found in the bathtub, still clothed in the party dress she also may have worn at her wedding ceremony at Chicago's City Hall. There were no signs of forced entry into Carrera’s apartment, according to investigators. That day, the bride's family received a haunting phone call from a sister of her new husband, who told them he had called her weeping and said that he had left his bride bleeding after a ‘bad fight.’ Slain: Estrella Carrera's family became concerned when the mother of two failed to pick up her children on Sunday . Most of Carrera's family disapproved of her three–year relationship with Jimenez, even though he was the father of her two-year-old son. Jimenez had hit and bruised Carrera in the past, according to Carrera’s older sister, Jazmin. Police also said family members reported incidents of violence while the couple was dating. Jazmin Carrera described Jimenez as ‘very possessive’ and jealous. She said she does not understand why her sister married the 30-year-old in what seemed like a rushed ceremony that the bride had kept secret from almost everyone. Jazmin Carrera received a text message from her sister two days before the wedding, inviting her to join them and their friends at a Mexican restaurant and a nightclub to celebrate the nuptials. She chose not to attend. Crime scene: Police who arrived at Carrera's apartment to check up on her discovered her dead in the tub, still wearing her party dress . Timeline: Police believe Carrera was killed shortly after she and Jimenez returned to her apartment in Burbank on Saturday . ‘It was just all of a sudden,’ Jazmin Carrera said. ‘She didn't give us enough notice.’ The pair were last seen around 4am on Saturday morning, according to officials. On Sunday, relatives heard about the phone call from Jimenez's sister, who said that when she tried to call her brother back, he would not pick up, according to Jazmin Carrera. Authorities made a plea to Jimenez to turn himself in ‘for the sake of his family and especially his children,’ Ford said. Investigators do not believe Jimenez is a danger to others, although they say they have no way of knowing his current state of mind.","The 2006 black Maserati was found in the garage of Humberto Jimenez .

The Queen wants a new gardener to maintain her Buckingham Palace lawns to 'the highest standards', encourage wildlife and recycle waste at her home - all for less than £300 a week. The successful green-fingered candidate for the £14,950-a-year job must also be proficient in 'good organic horticultural practices' when tending the Palace's shrub, herbaceous and rose borders. The gardener will also carry out green waste recycling duties. The new gardener is expected to maintain the Palace gardens to a 'high standard', as well as a range of other duties. (file picture) Queen Elizabeth II at a garden party she hosted at Buckingham Palace. The Royal grounds is regularly used to host summer parties and has also been used for a charity tennis competition, pop and classical music concerts and a children's party featuring a host of characters from children's books . Buckingham Palace boasts more than 40 acres of garden including 350 different species of flower, 200 trees and a lake . Any applicant must also be an early riser, as the 40-hour-a-week job starts at 7.30am and be prepared to work overtime depending on the season. The job details, published on the Royal website, make it clear that the gardener must be green aware. Candidates must 'have a keen interest in conservation and organic practices'. Duties include leaf clearing without the use of machinery to 'encourage the development of the wildlife'. The advert also reads: 'To carry out green waste recycling duties including transporting the Royal Mews skips to allotment sites. 'Have substantial practical horticultural experience including herbaceous and rose practices'. The Buckingham Palace lake can be seen in this photograph of a garden party taken in 1988 . The Royal gardens feature a range of environmentally friendly initiatives. Mark Lane, gardens manager at Buckingham Palace, said on the Royal Household's website: 'At Buckingham Palace, 99% of green waste is recycled on site. Green waste includes grass cuttings, twigs, branches and ""arisings"" (soiled straw from the stables in the Royal Mews). More than 800 people work at Buckingham Palace. The Royal residence is equipped with 188 bedrooms for staff who live or stay at the Palace. As well as the expected jobs of housekeeping, horticulture, catering and administration, the Palace also employs a fendersmith, to clean and repair metal fenders in front of fireplaces. Two full-time horological conservators are employed to wind up Buckingham Palace's 350 clocks and watches every week and keep them in working order. A flag serjeant has the role of raising and lowering the correct flag as the Queen arrives at or departs from the Palace. Cleaners are employed to maintain the 760 windows within the Palace. Each window is cleaned every six weeks. 'Waste is also brought in from Kensington Palace, Marlborough House and St James’s Palace grounds. This is put through a shredder so that bacteria can operate more quickly on smaller pieces of material. 'The waste is regularly turned until it has rotted sufficiently to be used as mulch. We then use this when preparing new flower beds. The mulch protects plants from heat and cold, retains water, suppresses weed germination and prevents soil from being washed away in the rain.' Buckingham Palace's garden stretches out over 40 acres and features a lake, a helicopter landing area, a tennis court and is home to 30 different species of bird and 350 different wild flowers. In 2009 an allotment was planted in the garden of Buckingham Palace for the first time since the Second World War. The 30 feet by 24 feet plot is managed organically and the produce is used by the Palace kitchens. Eco-conscious gardeners also leave larger pieces of wood stacked around the Palace grounds to provide habitats for a variety of flora and fauna, including beetles, spiders and fungi. Tree stumps are not removed, but are left to rot away naturally, providing a perfect environment for insects to lay their eggs and hatch their larvae in. Dead trees are also left alone, with one such tree at the bottom of the Rose Garden currently providing a habitat for a family of Woodpeckers. 'The use of pesticides is kept to a minimum, and the aim is that eventually they will be phased out completely', said Mr Lane. 'Whereas weed killer was once used on the paths of the Buckingham Palace grounds, now a weed burning machine is used instead. This breaks up the cells of living plants so that they explode through heat, meaning that there is no need for chemicals which could potentially be harmful to wildlife.' Queen Elizabeth chose the Buckingham Palace garden for the recording of her Christmas broadcast message in 1975 - the first time she recorded it out of doors . Sustainable plant life is encouraged, with a long grass policy currently in use over approximately 10% of the Buckingham Palace garden area. Among the wildflowers found in the garden are Creeping Buttercup and Herb Robert. In addition, the stretch of ground around the edge of the lake is cut on a rotational basis every four years to allow flora and fauna to prosper uninterrupted. As well as sustaining existing flora and fauna, new wildlife and plant life is also encouraged. Over the last 10 years, many more seed bearing plants have been introduced into the garden; these encourage a wealth of bird life to come into the Palace grounds to feed during the winter months. The gardener job advert as seen on the Royal Household's website . More native plants have also been brought in. Seed bearing plants include a wide variety of Cotoneaster and Rowans, and natives have included the Aspen and female Black Poplar. Mr Lane added: 'We also ensure that the machinery which is used for the upkeep of the gardens is environmentally sound. The weed burning machine runs off the same liquid petroleum gas supply which is used for The Duke of Edinburgh’s taxi. Biodegradable diesel, lubricants and oils are used in lawn mowers and other pieces of machinery.' The new gardener must hold a formal qualification in horticulture and have 'have a keen interest in conservation and organic practices.'","New gardener needed to work organically in team of eco-friendly staff at Buckingham Palace .

This shift was highlighted when the Duchess of Cambridge was seen as ‘old’ when she married Prince William at the age of 29 last year. The study, by insurance providers Direct Line, also revealed the age of first time mothers has risen steadily in the last 30 years. While in 1974 the average age of first time mums was 24, the age in 2010 was four years older at 28. Dame Helen Mirren and Cameron Diaz are leading the trend of women in no rush to start a family . Despite this, it seems the ages of grandparents and great grandparents have become lower - 50 per cent of people now becoming grandparents before they reach 65. Celebs fitting in to this category include television host Sharon Osbourne, 60, and actor Tom Hanks, 56. Meanwhile, half of us will also now become great grandparents at some point in their lifetime. Kerry Chilvers, of Direct Line, said: 'Our research has shown what is important to us, and when we achieve these things, is shifting with time. Duchess of Cambridge was seen as 'old' when she married Prince William at the age of 29 last year . 'The inconvenience linked with unwanted interruptions and subsequent loss of time is shown to be a major concern.' Accountant Jane Bush, 42, from Southampton, Hants, said: 'Despite my friends all having kids, being a mum has never really interested me. 'I have a great job and would rather focus on my career at the moment and continue to enjoy my independence. 'I’ve always thought, ""perhaps one day I will have a child"", but realistically I expect it will not happen and I don’t think I’ll regret it.'","54% of Brits view marriage as an important milestone .

A father who had his ear bitten off in a random vicious attack now feels he can face the world again, after surgeons created an ultra-realistic prosthetic to replace it. Thomas Tracey, 47, of Solihull, Birmingham, lost his entire left ear when a thug brutally assaulted him at a bonfire night in November 2009. He was with his children Demi, 16 and Daniel, 13 when the attack happened and had lost his wife to cancer just one month before. 'I had been at a bonfire with my two kids when this lunatic came out of nowhere, he must have been on drugs, and started on me. 'He bit my whole ear clean off.

Free bus passes are spreading good health among older people, a report by scientists said yesterday. They found that over-60s who take advantage of their right to free bus travel are also likely to walk and take exercise. The research project concluded that the benefits for older people who use buses include better mobility and strength and a lower risk of heart disease, falls and broken bones. Promoting good health: Over-60s who take advantage of free bus passes are likely to walk more and take other exercise, scientists said . The findings, carried out by . researchers from the School of Public Health at Imperial College, come . as David Cameron is under growing pressure to scrap the perk of free bus . passes for over-60s, which costs taxpayers £1.1billion a year. The bus passes have been a target for . cost-cutters since the recession began and their high cost has attracted . growing controversy. The Prime Minister has promised to keep the . system, which is extremely popular among older voters, but ministers . including Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and some LibDems . think the right to free bus travel should be means tested. Mr Cameron’s line is likely to get a . boost from the research report, which said both better off and poorer . people get health benefits from bus travel. Sophie Coronini-Cronberg, who led the . project, said: ‘Given the need to encourage older people to be . physically active, it is good news that the provision of free bus passes . seems to be having a positive impact. ‘Before the Government looks at . reforming the scheme, they should make sure we understand its value to . society.’ The study, based on information from four years of the . National Travel Survey, which examines the travel habits of more than . 16,000 people. All aboard: Elderly people who use their free bus pass have better mobility and strength and a lower risk of heart disease and falls . It showed that over-60s with a free . bus pass are more likely to walk frequently and to engage in what . academics describe as ‘active travel’. This include, walking, cycling and using public transport, which in turn is likely to require walking. 'Given the need to encourage older people to be physically active, it is good news that the provision of bus passes is having a positive impact' Sophie Coronini-Cronberg, study leader . The survey showed that the year before . free bus passes were introduced, 2005, 56.8 per cent of people were . using buses. By 2008, the percentage of bus users had grown to 74.7 per . cent. It also showed that the main reason that someone does not walk or engage in ‘active travel’ is that they have a car. A reason for greater health among bus . users, the report said, is ‘incidental’ exercise walking to and from bus . stops and around towns and other destinations visited by travellers . with free passes. Bus travel, it added, is most common . among older people in towns and cities. In small towns and the . countryside, where bus services are usually limited, older people are . more likely to walk. But passes were introduced by then . Chancellor Gordon Brown in 2006. They currently give pass holders free . travel on many buses after the morning peak hour and all day at weekends . and holidays.

The Queen’s cousin Prince Michael of Kent has been secretly receiving hundreds of thousands of pounds from Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky. Dozens of payments worth at least £320,000 from the exiled tycoon  were channelled through offshore companies. Prince Michael is already known for accepting charity from the Queen who started paying the rent at Kensington Palace when MPs wanted to evict him and Princess Michael of Kent. But now the royal, dubbed the ‘pauper prince’, faces questions about whether he has offered anything in return for the billionaire Russian’s money. His spokesman yesterday said ‘absolutely not’, adding: ‘Mr Berezovsky has known the prince since the early 1990s and has a high regard for the prince’s work. He therefore chose to be supportive over a period which ended some years ago.’ A friend of the oligarch suggested he simply wanted to be a part of high society, and his friendship with Prince Michael gave him coveted access. Mr Berezovsky was a key figure in the Kremlin before falling out with Vladimir Putin and seeking asylum in Britain 12 years ago. He became friends with Prince Michael – a distant cousin of the last tsar, Nicholas II – and the pair have frequently dined together at Kensington Palace. High Court papers reveal that a fund controlled by the Russian made 56 payments worth between £5,000 and £15,000 to a company run by Prince Michael’s private secretary. The money was paid every two to three weeks between 2002 and 2008. Royals: Prince and Princess Michael of Kent live a luxurious life at Kensington Palace . Mr Berezovsky told The Sunday Times: ‘There is nothing underhand or improper about the financial assistance I have given Prince Michael. It is a matter between friends.’ Yesterday sources close to the prince said the money was used to pay for ‘his staff, his office and his private secretary’. Support: Russian exile Boris Berezovsky said there was nothing underhand in the money he had given . Although a member of the Royal Family, Prince Michael does not receive money from the public purse, and his money worries have been previously well publicised. His wife – nicknamed ‘Princess Pushy’ by the rest of the Royal Family – once said she would ‘go anywhere for a hot meal’. In 2000, two years before the first payment from Mr Berezovsky, the prince’s consultancy firm Cantium Services was reported to have had debts of £200,000. The financial support from Mr Berezovsky went to Bulmer Investments, a private firm run by private secretary Nicholas Chance, an Old Etonian. The oligarch made his fortune during the Russian state privatisation programme in the 1990s. A Moscow court convicted him in 2007 in his absence of embezzling £4.4million and branded him a member of an ‘organised crime group’. But Mr Berezovsky has dismissed the ruling as farce trumped up by his enemies in the Kremlin. The Russian government has tried and failed to extradite him to Moscow. Simon Astaire, the prince’s spokesman, said the royal was ‘absolutely not’ giving anything in return for the money, which he claimed funded ‘cultural and charitable activities’. Well traveled: Prince Michael and Princess Michael of Kent during a trip to Rome . Together: Prince Michael of Kent, pictured sixth from the left on the back row, pictured with the rest of the Royal family . He said: ‘The way this arrangement was . processed is a private matter, but suffice to say that it was conducted . properly and, for example, all appropriate tax was paid.’ The first payment to the prince in . 2002 coincided with criticism from an MPs committee about the £69 a week . rent the prince paid for his Kensington Palace home. The Queen later . stepped in with a personal subsidy of £100,000 a year to pay a market . rent. Prince and Princess Michael had to sell their eight bedroom mansion in Gloucestershire in 2006 for £5.75million to cut their costs. They have faced claims they used their titles to get free trips and boost their income, earning them the nickname ‘Rent-a-Kents’. In 2010 it emerged taxpayers were footing a £250,000-a-year bill for armed police protection for the royal couple, even though they carry out no official duties. Prince Michael is allowed to take up to three officers with him on his numerous business trips to foreign destinations such as Moscow and China. Princess Michael has long had expensive tastes, and spends a fortune on fine antiques and paintings. She also found herself exposed by a reporter from the now-defunct News of the World as being available at around £25,000 for appearances such as opening a shopping centre in Dubai. Details of the payments by Mr Berezovsky come ahead of a case in which the Russian is suing the family of a former  partner in a £2billion battle. He is pursuing the widow of Badri Patarkatsishvili, a Georgian tycoon who died in 2008. The case follows Mr Berezovsky’s high profile £3.5billion legal action against fellow Russian Roman Abramovich. Judgment in his case against the Chelsea FC owner has yet to be handed down.","The 56 payments, worth between £5,000 and £15,000, were made between 2002 and 2008 .

While for others it offered a romantic image of the vagrant 'rag lady' surviving against the odds. But now homeless former concert pianist Anne Naysmith is devastated after workmen pulled down the makeshift shelter she has lived in for the last decade. Tearful Miss Naysmith, 75, said it was 'wanton, wicked vandalism' after she discovered the men from Tfl tearing down her den at Stamford Brook Station in Chiswick, west London. The Rag Lady of Chiswick: Anne Naysmith, now 75, sits among a pile of rubbish several years ago after workmen destroyed a previous shelter she had been living in . Over the last ten years, the pensioner - known as the rag lady of Chiswick - had become used to bedding down in the undergrowth and cultivated a small bed of shrubs, plants and fruit trees. Despite offers of shelter and charity, she continued living among the vegetation while surviving on scraps of food and the occasional snack from nearby cherry and plum trees. Her future on the embankment now looks uncertain after the London Ungerground workers this week cut back the trees and put up a security fence to keep out vandals. 'It's wanton, wicked vandalism,' Miss Naysmith told the Guardian. 'This was a lovely patch of garden. I was doing nobody any harm. It seems that if they don't like the look of something they can just knock it all down. It's a disgrace.' Miss Naysmith wanders along the street with bags on her feet while carrying a few possessions . The blue Ford Consul from the 1960s that Miss Naysmith had lived in after being kicked out of her flat is towed away in March 2002 in a move that bitterly divided neighbors . This satellite image shows the tube station where Miss Naysmith has been bedding down, just a short distance from Prebend Gardens where she used to live in a flat . Miss Naysmith once played at Wigmore Hall in central London and was tipped to be one of the greatest pianists of her generation. But after a man 'broke her heart' her life went into freefall and she was evicted from her flat in leafy Prebend Gardens, in Chiswick. Aged 39, she began sleeping in her blue Ford Consul in echoes of Miss Shepherd from the Alan Bennett play The Lady in the Van. But ten years ago neighbours began to complain about her and her car was towed away. She built a similar shelter in a car park piled high with earth and compost from skips - sprouts fuchsias, geraniums, wallflowers and pansies donated by locals and garden centres. Miss Naysmith's plight has echoes of Alan Bennett's play Lady In The Van. The story is based on his own experience of an eccentric elderly woman called Miss Shepherd who lived on his driveway in run-down vans over the course of 15 years. Bennett, who stars as himself, eventually builds up a friendship with Miss Shepherd. Miss Shepherd camped close to his home in Camden, north London, just ten miles from Chiswick where Miss Naysmith lives. The most striking similarity is that Miss Shepherd was also a musician who took to living on the streets after running into financial problem. The play has been written for stage, radio, published as a book and released in an essay form. It is one of Bennett's most popular productions and continues to be staged at theatres across the country. Then that was also ripped down by council workers who believed it to be wasteland. It was then that she is believed to have found her small patch of land on the embankment of the underground station. Her day normally begins when she wakes at her shelter, washes in public toilets and cleans her clothes with a hosepipe at a petrol station. They are wrapped in newspaper to dry. She spends her mornings wandering among shops picking rubbish from bins to feed herself and the pigeons. She regularly listens in on court cases, indulging an interest in law held since childhood. Once a week she immerses herself in books and scores at Barbican music library - her only concession to her former life, of which she refuses to speak. But Miss Naysmith now says she is uncertain about how her lfie will continue. She said she was stunned when she saw her 'home' being knocked down. She added: 'I started screaming: ''Police, police!'' I couldn't understand what had happened. I thought it was beautiful. Why would anyone do something like that?' Neighbour Betty Furner said she found Miss Naysmith 'trembling with shock' and crying. They claim that the clearing by TfL had little to do with 'safety concerns'. John Power added: 'This is her house. She is a valued member of the community who deserves much better than this uncaring treatment.' Friends say she has money - she was one of the shareholders to benefit from a windfall when the Halifax building society became a bank in the early Nineties - but offers of accommodation and charity are refused. Speaking about the last time her . shack was destroyed, she said: 'I've had so many hardships in my life, . so many disappointments and failures. You wouldn't call me one of life's . successes. But life goes on. You do what you can. 'I made a little square in the corner . of the asphalt to do my cooking. Every time I cooked the fire would melt . away a bit more asphalt and, little by little, I chipped it away.' TfL said the work was being carried out to replace a damaged section of fencing that posed a security risk. A spokesman added: 'Earlier this week, some contractors, working on our behalf, near Stamford Brook Tube station removed some overgrown vegetation to replace a section of damaged fencing. This damage was a risk to the security of the railway and the safety of any intruder. 'The contractors were not aware of the special significance this piece of land had for Miss Naysmith and their primary concern was dealing with a safety critical issue. Obviously we very much regret the distress caused to Miss Naysmith.'
