"Senators lashed out at Secretary of State John Kerry on Wednesday during a hearing about America's response to the ISIS terror army, as lawmakers from both sides of the political aisle agreed that the Obama administration needs a new approval from Congress if it plans to continue bombing raids and other 'offense' measures past the end of the month. The White House is operating under the authority of the U.S. Constitution, which allows the president to wage war for 90 days in the face of a national security threat without going to Capitol Hill for permission. That period expires in a few weeks, but the administration plans to rely on a Bush-era Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), granted by Congress in 2001, to continue. 'You're going to need a new AUMF, and it'll have to be more tailored,' Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's chairman, told Kerry. His GOP counterpart, ranking Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, was far more aggressive, barking that President Obama and a coterie of supportive senators 'are exercising terrible judgment right now' by deploying America's military in Iraq 'regardless of what we say.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Rock, meet hard place: Kerry (center) heard doubts from Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez (right) and scorching criticism from Republican Sen. Bob Corker (left) Kerry was faced with one of his former Senate colleagues blasting: 'Do you realize how unserious the things that you have laid out, and the things that were laid out yesterday, sound?' Corker slammed Kerry for backing a White House plan 'that you say is going to be multi-year – some people say a decade.' The 2001 AUMF specifically authorized the government to attack al-Qaeda inside Iraq. Now the administration is attacking ISIS, the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, and has pledged to pursue the terror group into Syria if necessary. 'Taking us into another country with a different enemy is exercising the worst judgment possible,' Corker said. Kerry insisted that he favors a new congressional authorization for the Obama administration. 'We're asking you to do it,' he said. 'Pass it tomorrow.' But Corker said Kerry was 'asking us to do it, but you're not giving any details because you don't have them.' Kerry insisted that the administration would wait to share more information with Congress until retired General John Allen, the president's special envoy, had a chance to run elbows with potential partner states during an upcoming United Nations meeting. 'Do you realize how unserious the things that you have laid out, and the things that were laid out yesterday, sound?' Corker asked. 'It seems like a – it seems like a political answer.' 'I hope you'll lay out a plan that will convince us that you're serious about doing the things you said you're going to do, to the American people and to us, about ISIL,' he continued. 'Because you haven't done it now.' The fast-moving ISIS episode saw several new developments on Wednesday. The House of Representatives approved a measure that would provide funds for a train-and-equip mission designed to help 'moderate' Syrian rebel groups battle both ISIS and the country's dictator, Bashar al-Assad. Meet the press: Kerry insisted on Wednesday that the Wall Street Journal's praise of his coalition-building efforts in Iraq were ample proof that the White House's strategy is working . The normally taciturn secretary of state verbally body-slammed the female-dominated CODEPINK protest group on Wednesday for protecting ISIS as it rapes and pillages its way across Iraq and Syria . And disagreements continued to swirl over whether a ground incursion will ultimately have to be part of President Barack Obama's wartime toolbox. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi insisted that her position was a ‘blanket ""no"",' mirroring the pledge the president made hours earlier to an audience of servicemen and women at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida. But former Defense Secretary Robert Gates claimed that the U.S. will need to put boots on the ground if there is ‘to be any hope of success.' Earlier in Wednesday's hearing, Kerry deviated from his prepared testimony to rake the far-left female-dominated protest group CODEPINK over the coals for objecting to the U.S. government's military involvement in an anti-ISIS campaign. The terror group, he said, 'is killing and raping and mutilating women.' 'They're cold-blooded killers marauding across the Middle East, making a mockery of a peaceful religion,' Kerry said of the Islamist terror army. Like Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Foreign Relations Committee hearing was preceded by a handful of the group's activists holding signs and shouting anti-war slogans in the hearing room. Kerry said he respected their right to protest, but took time out to upbraid them personally for standing in the Obama administration's way. Kerry blasted CODEPINK activists for aiding 'cold-blooded killers marauding across the Middle East, making a mockery of a peaceful religion' Not impressed: Senators from both side of the aisle had doubts on Wednesday about the mechanics and goals of the Obama administration's approach to fighting ISIS, and the legal justification for waging war without permission from Congress . After reading the first four paragraphs of a five-page prepared statement, the norally taciturn Kerry launched into an impromptu offensive against the protesters. 'You know, as I came in here, obviously we had some folks who spoke out. And I would start by saying that I understand dissent. I've lived it,' he said, referring to his leadership of Vietname Veterans Against the War nearly 40 years ago. 'That's how I first testified in front of this country in 1971.' But CODEPINK, he said, 'was started by a woman, or women, who were opposed to war but who also thought that government's job was to take care of people, give them health care, and education, and good jobs.' 'And if that's what you believe in, and I believe it is, then you ought to care about fighting ISIL,' he said, referring to ISIS by the alternative name preferred by the Obama administration. 'Because ISIL is killing and raping and mutilating women. And they believe women shouldn't have an education. They sell off girls to be sex slaves to jihadists.' CODEPINK is the brainchild of Medea Benjamin, a wealthy San Francisco peace activist who was herself arrested in March during a visit to Cairo while en route to a women's rights conference in Gaza. The pro-Palestinian agitator claimed later that she suffered a dislocated shoulder and a broken arm as Egyptian airport police in the Muslim Brotherhood-run capital city restrained her. Kerry emphasized that 'there is nothing to negotiate' with ISIS. 'They're not offering anyone health care of any kind. They're not offering education of any kind,' he said, addressing the protesters in the room. Kerry insisted that the Obama administration's strategy will stop ISIS 'from denying the women and the girls and the people of Iraq the very future that they yearn for' Medea Benjamin was arrested on July 30 during a civil-disobedience protest in front of the Israeli Embassy in Washington, DC. CODEPINK was protesting the deaths of Palestinians in Gaza . Benjamin was last seen Tuesday in a different Senate hearing, shouting slogans before Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey testified about the war on ISIS . 'For a whole philosophy, or idea, or cult – whatever you want to call it – that frankly comes out of the stone age, they're cold-blooded killers marauding across the Middle East, making a mockery of a peaceful religion.' 'And that's precisely why we are building a coalition to try to stop them from denying the women and the girls and the people of Iraq the very future that they yearn for,' Kerry said. 'And frankly, CODEPINK and a lot of other people need to stop and think about how you stop them and deal with that.' In response, a protester shouted five times, as police led her out: 'Your invasion will not protect the homeland!' After his opening statement, Ranking Republican Senator Bob Corker challenged Kerry for presiding over a 'political answer' to Middle Eastern unrest that's an 'unserious' path to defeating ISIS. Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who is among the panel's most liberal members, echoed Kerry's outrage. ISIS, she said, 'is selling 14-year-olds' and 'giving them as gifts to their fighters.' 'They say, ""If you don't take our twisted version of Islam, you either flee, you convert, or you die.'","Democratic Sen.

"Hackers associated with the . Chinese government have repeatedly infiltrated the computer . systems of U.S. airlines, technology companies and other firms . involved in the movement of U.S. troops and military equipment, . a U.S. Senate panel has found. The Senate Armed Services Committee's year-long probe, . details of which were made public on Wednesday, found that the . military's U.S. Transportation Command, or Transcom, was aware . of only two out of at least 20 such cyber intrusions within a . single year. The committee's investigation also found gaps in reporting . requirements and a lack of information sharing among U.S. government entities. That in turn left the U.S. military largely . unaware of computer compromises of its contractors, it found. A US Senate report says there were about 50 hacker intrusions into a single military contractor's computers over a 12-month period . 'Unit 61398' of the Peoples Liberation Army of China is reportedly the site of origin for hacking attacks, but the Chinese government denies it . 'These peacetime intrusions into the networks of key defense . contractors are more evidence of China's aggressive actions in . cyberspace,' Democratic Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the . committee's chairman, said in releasing the report. The investigation focused on the U.S. military's ability to . seamlessly tap into civilian air, shipping and other . transportation assets for rapid troop deployments and the timely . arrival of supplies from food to ammunition to fuel. In a 12-month period beginning June 1, 2012, there were . about 50 intrusions or other cyber events into the computer . networks of Transcom contractors, the 52-page report stated. At least 20 of those were successful intrusions attributed . to an 'advanced persistent threat,' a term used to designate . sophisticated threats commonly associated with governments. All . of those intrusions were attributed to China, the report stated. Senate Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, the committee's top . Republican, called for a 'central clearinghouse' that makes it . easy for contractors, especially small businesses, to report . suspicious cyber activity. Among the investigation's discoveries was that a 'Chinese . military intrusion' into a Transcom contractor between 2008 and . 2010 'compromised emails, documents, user passwords and computer code.' At least 20 cy ber attacks were attributed to an 'advanced persistent threat' and linked to China . In 2012, an intrusion was made into multiple systems of a . commercial ship contracted by Transcom, the report said. The Senate probe could further increase tensions between the . two world powers over cyber spying. Officials with the Chinese embassy in Washington were not . immediately available to comment. The results of the investigation were revealed months after .

"Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston will be suspended for half of Saturday's game against Clemson after yelling obscenities in the center of campus. At 20, the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback's athletic displays have lit up crowds at FSU, but this latest spectacle follows a string of questionable behavior off the field. Winston's alleged crimes run from the absurd, such as shoplifting crab and stealing soda in ketchup cups, to the horrific, as Winston was accused of raping a student in 2012. Scroll down for video . Suspended: Heisman Trophy-winner Jameis Winston was suspended for half a game for shouting obscenities in the center of FSU campus Tuesday . On Tuesday, students at FSU started tweeting that they had seen Winston in the middle of campus shouting, 'f*** her right in the p****.' The phrase comes from a series of videos staged to look newscasts that went viral earlier in the year. On Wednesday FSU's athletic director Stan Wilcox and interim president Garrett Stokes issued a statement saying Winston 'will be withheld from competition for the first half of the Clemson game.' Winston called his outburst a 'selfish act' in his regularly scheduled press conference after news of the suspension broke. Winston was the target of a rape investigation after a fellow student said he sexually assaulted her while she was intoxicated back in December 2012 as a teammate filmed the act. The New York Times reported in the wake of the alleged sexual assault at Florida State that there was 'virtually no investigation at all.' Heisman: Winston ascended to the national spotlight for his athletic prowess but his off-field behavior has brought the school negative attention and a Title IX investigation . On tape: Winston is recognizable throughout Tallahassee, and just before he is caught on tape leaving a Publix with unpaid food, a bystander is seen gawking at him . Police waited almost a year to interview a witness and gather DNA evidence from the accused, finally declining to prosecute Winston. A Title IX investigation was later launched against FSU. In 2013, cops were called to a Tallahassee Burger King after an assistant manager says she saw Winston stealing soda in ketchup cups. No charges were pressed at the time. The next year, Winston was caught on camera walking out of a Publix supermarket with $32.72 worth of crab legs and crawfish without paying. According to Tomahawk Nation Winston received a citation and his punishment was community service and a temporary suspension from the baseball team, where he plays outfield.","Jameis Winston, 20, won the Heisman Trophy while guiding Florida State's football team to a national championship .

"Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel dramatically upgraded the U.S. government's estimation of the threats America faces from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) on Thursday, saying its jihadi network represents 'an imminent threat to every interest we have, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else.' ISIS is 'as sophisticated and well-funded as any group that we have seen,' Hagel told a group of reporters during a joint press conference he held with Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey. 'They're beyond just a terrorist group.They marry ideology and a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess. They are tremendously well funded. ...This is beyond anything we've seen, so we must prepare for everything.' 'And the only way you do that is that you take a cold, steely, hard look at it and – and – and get ready.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Grave threat: Secretary of Defense Chuck hagel and Chairman of the joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey at the press conference where they delivered the dire warning . Not just airstrikes: Hagel and Dempsey said that much of America's long-term involvement in Iraq will continue to consist of assistance to Iraq's nascent government as it trains volunteers like these Shi'ites, who have joined the battle against ISIS . Battling ISIS 'is going to be a very long contest,' Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey warned on Thursday . 'It's a long-term threat,' he conceded under questioning from reporters, adding moments later that 'the president has been very clear on mission creep. And he's made it very clear that he will not allow that.' Gen. Dempsey warned that America's involvement in Iraq will continue for years to come, citing the intensity of hatred among ethnic, religious and tribal groups there. 'The conflict against those groups – most of which are local, some of which are regional, and some of which are global in nature – that's going to be a very long contest,' he said. 'It's ideological. It's not political. It's religious in many cases. So, yes, it's going to be a very long contest.' At the same time the decorated general cautioned that the 'required participation' of the U.S. would remain one of coalition leadership 'to provide the unique capabilities that we provide, but not necessarily all the capabilities' – a suggestion that an unlimited release of military might to crush ISIS is off the table. Dempsey added later in the briefing that ISIS can't practically be contained in Iraq, since it also has deep roots and tremendous resources across the Syrian border. Forget about Bowe Bergdahl: State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said Thursday that the US does not 'make concessions to terrorists' – including the payment of ransom for the safe return of kidnapped hostages . The terror group 'has an apocalyptic end-of-days strategic vision that will eventually have to be defeated,' the general explained. 'Can they be defeated without addressing that part of the organization that resides in Syria? The answer is no. That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border.' Hagel fielded a question about whether future U.S. military action could include a direct focus on Syria, answering: 'We continue to explore all options.' As American military action expands in Iraq, he said, much of that help is in the form of 'a tremendous amount of military assistance to the Peshmerga through the Iraqi security forces.' 'There's no question that we have been accelerated – as a matter of fact, all year long, we have been accelerated – [through] all the requests made by the Iraqi government for lethal assistance and equipment, and we continue to do that. He downplayed the long-term strategic value of the limited airstrikes that President Barack Obama has authorized, saying that in the long term they could be just a table-setter. Defeating ISIS 'isn't going to just come as a result of airstrikes,' Hagel said. 'Strategically, there are limits to how much you can accomplish with airstrikes. Tactically, you can accomplish a significant amount. I think we've seen that. 'ISIS will only truly be defeated when it's rejected by the 20 million disenfranchised Sunni that happen to reside between Damascus and Baghdad,' he explained. 'It requires a variety of instruments, only one small part of which is airstrikes. I'm not predicting those will occur in Syria, at least not by the United States of America. But it requires the application of all of the tools of national power – diplomatic, economic, information, military.' Hagel and Dempsey also discussed a failed mission to rescue American photojournalist James Foley and other ISIS hostages this summer. An ISIS militant with a British accent beheaded Foley this week in a shocking video that rocketed across the Internet, blaming Obama for airstrikes against ISIS positions in northern Iraq. Earlier on Thursday, State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters that winning Foley's return by paying off ISIS was never an option, and that 'the U.S. Government did not have contact with' ISIS after a warning came that Foley would be killed if airstrikes continued. 'We do not make concessions to terrorists,' she said. 'That includes – we do not pay ransoms.' 'One of the main ways ISI[S] has been funded throughout this conflict has been from ransom payments that others have paid. We believe just in 2014 that that’s in the millions of dollars.' End of the world: The terror group 'has an apocalyptic end-of-days strategic vision that will eventually have to be defeated,' Dempsey explained . R.I.P James Foley: The journalist, dressed in Guantanamo-style orange clothing, was killed on-camera by a masked Islamist belonging to ISIS, who beheaded him with a short knife . 'So we believe that paying ransoms or making concessions,' Harf said, 'would both put our – all Americans overseas – at greater risk for kidnapping and in harm’s way, but that ransoms would also fund and finance exactly the groups we are trying to degrade their capabilities.' Harf did not address the recent return of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from Taliban forces, which was achieved through a prison swap that required the release of five high-value Taliban Islamists from the American military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The Obama administration seems to be treating ISIS as a completely different animal. 'This is not about ISI[S] versus the United States,' Harf said Thursday. 'They are killing anyone who gets in their way – Sunni, Shia Muslims, Christians, Yazidis, Iraqis, Syrians – anyone who gets in their way, and now an American. So this is not about what the United States is or isn’t doing. This is about ISIL’s stated commitment to murder, rape, enslave people who don’t agree with their ideology.'","Defense Secretary spoke alongside Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen.

"A suspected case of mistaken identity has left a 32-year-old man dead during a night-time romantic encounter in a Northeast Philadelphia apartment this week. Marc Carrion was shot in the head inside a unit at the Holme Circle Apartments Monday night after police say the man who lived there found the victim hiding in his daughter's bedroom. Carrion was rushed to Aria Health Torresdale Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries early Tuesday morning. Confrontation: Charles Jordan, 41 (left), shot dead 32-year-old Marc Carrion (right) after finding him crouching in his daughter's bedroom in Philadelphia . 'Lover': Those who knew Carrion said he had been romantically involved with Brenda Jordan, 20 (pictured), and she likely invited him to her room . Investigators believe Charles Jordan, 41, opened fire on Carrion because he took him for an intruder, but those who knew the 32-year-old claim the man had been invited into the house by Jordan's 20-year-old daughter, reported the Philadelphia Daily News. The 41-year-old shooter has been cooperative with the investigation, surrendering his licensed gun and submitting himself to questioning by police. So far, no charges have been filed in the deadly shooting. The incident took place at around 11.30pm Monday when police officers received a 911 call from the Holme Circle housing complex on Axe Factory Road about shots fired. Responding officers entered Charles Jordan’s second-floor apartment and found Marc Carrion lying inside with a single gunshot wound to the head. Charles Jordan told officers that he came into his daughter Brenda’s room and found the 32-year-old stranger crouching in the corner. A struggle ensued and Jordan shot Carrion from a revolver. Crime scene: The shooting took place inside the Jordans' apartment at the Holme Circle housing complex . Investigators working to piece together what happened inside Jordan's home Monday night have uncovered evidence to suggest that Brenda Jordan was dating Carrion and had invited him into her room. A neighbor told the paper that he heard a gunshot in the night followed by a woman's scream, 'No, Daddy, No!' The woman, presumed to be Ms Jordan, was then overhead saying: 'Why did you do that? He was my best friend.' Marc Carrion's mother, Gloria Moyett, told the paper Charles Jordan’s story about an intruder does not make sense to her, nor does his violent reaction. Romance: Jordan and Carrion had met only recently, and on the night of the killing a neighbor overheard the 20-year-old tell her father that the victim was her 'best friend' ‘He's with your daughter, she's not screaming, and you shoot him just because you don't know him?’ she said. Moyett said her 32-year-old son a troubled past, including a drug arrest in 2008, but he had been working hard to rebuild his life. Carrion and Brenda Jordan had met only recently. Her Facebook page lists him as a friend. Carrion is survived by three young children from a previous relationship.","Marc Carrion, 32, was shot in the head after Charles Jordan, 41, found him hiding in his 20-year-old daughter's bedroom in Philadelphia .

"Experiencing Oculus Rift for the first time can be an amazing experience for new users. But for one dad the experience was even better than he imagined when his son took him on a virtual rollercoaster ride. He whoops with delight with his arms raised for most of the ride as the headset takes him on a track around a virtual house. Scroll down for video . A son has filmed his dad riding an Oculus Rift rollercoaster (screen grab shown), with his dad seemingly thrilled by the experience as he's taken round a track. In the video he's shown whooping and cheering throughout the ride. It highlights how unique the headset can be for people who are trying it for the first time . The video was made by Austin Hooper on YouTube channel Hoopernation. His dad seems a little skeptical at first but after the first drop - which makes your stomach jump even without a headset - he quickly begins to enjoy himself. Halfway through he’s in for another surprise, when a virtual cannon launches him up a steep incline on the track. Oculus VR was founded by 21-year-old college dropout Palmer Luckey. It is designed to provide users with an immersive virtual reality experience not only for conventional video games, but for other activities as well. Facebook purchased the company earlier this year when their £1.2bn ($2bn) deal to buy VR headset firm Oculus was approved. It will first be used for immersive games, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised the headset will 'change the way we work, play and communicate' - although virtual worlds could include advertising admitted Zuckerberg. A commercial version is rumoured to launch in 2015. The purchase of Oculus put Facebook in a battle with Sony, who has already unveiled its own version of a VR headset, destined for the PS4 next year. ‘Oh my god, oh my god,' the dad explains as the rollercoaster plummets into a dive at the start. The dad then whoops and hollers as the track twists and turns, taking him under a sofa at one point and then to a launcher, which fires him up the side of the room. And the dad is then tilted sideways as the rollercoaster spins round, before returning back to the start. ‘So, since the reason as to why I got this thing was thanks to my dad, I was more than willing to let him try it out,’ Hooper writes on YouTube. He adds: ‘Me and my dad are absolutely blown away by all the people that liked the video.’ ‘According to him, you've all made him a “YouTube idiot”.’ Virtual reality headsets, such as Oculus Rift, allow gamers to use a pair of hi-tech ‘goggles’ with a screen instead of glass to play video games. While they are currently only available for developers, commercial virtual reality headsets are expected to launch next year. A set of lenses on the screen focuses and reshapes an image for each eye, which creates a 3D image. This image matches a wearer’s movements and makes it seem as if they have stepped into the realistic world they are seeing in front of them - with 360° views. Oculus, which has now been acquired by Facebook, has been fine tuning its technology for years and a commercial version of its headset is tipped to launch next year.

"Mexico's government airlifted thousands of stranded tourists out of the hurricane-ravaged resort of Los Cabos, as a weakened Odile headed over the Gulf of California on Wednesday on a path toward Arizona and a new storm loomed to the south. The remnants of Odile, which had been downgraded from a Category 3 hurricane to a tropical storm, were expected to reach Arizona on Wednesday evening and strike hardest in the Tucson area, though forecasters said Phoenix could get lashed with rain and heavy winds as well. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said parts of Arizona and New Mexico could receive 6 to 9 inches of rain, and possible flash flooding. Scroll down for video . An aerial view of the damages at a hotel on Tuesday after hurricane Odile struck in Baja California state in Mexico. Odile was downgraded to a tropical storm after leaving Baja California peninsula. It now heads for the Sea of Cortes in Mexican state of Sonora. About 26,000 tourists were affected by Odile . Mexican and foreign tourists arrive at an Air Force hangar in Mexico City after being airlifted out of the hurricane-ravaged resort area of Los Cabos by the Mexican armed forces on Tuesday . A general view shows the damage left by Hurricane Odile at Los Cabos international airport on Tuesday. Thousands were trapped in the resort as looters smashed shops open . In Mexico, residents of the resort state of Baja California Sur struggled with a lack of power and drinking water and formed long lines for emergency supplies. There were scattered reports of looting. Tourists, meanwhile, were ferried on military and commercial planes through the Los Cabos international airport, which remained closed to commercial flights due to damage suffered when Odile tore through the area late on Sunday and Monday. Travelers were being flown free of charge to airports in Tijuana, Mazatlan, Guadalajara and Mexico City to catch connecting flights. Some 685 U.S. tourists arriving in Tijuana were taken to the border late Tuesday to return home. Among the stranded were a bachelorette party of eight women who had gone to the luxury resort for a weekend of partying. The group of eight have been stranded at the Villa Del Arco hotel since Sunday night. The last time that their families heard from them, according to NBC. Carla Tapia of Mexicali, Mexico, said her family was given priority at the airport because they have two young children. Still, the wait was about six hours to get out. 'The destruction carried on for hours,' she said of the hurricane. 'It's really a mess now.' Fatai Oshi-Ojuri, a tourist from Oakland, California, who came to Mexico with his girlfriend to celebrate his 30th birthday, was among the first to get out on a Federal Police jet. He said the airport in Los Cabos was a mess with roof panels and electrical wiring down, and signs and windows shattered.

'That was like a scene from 'The Walking Dead,'' he said by phone from Mazatlan, where he was waiting for an Alaska Airlines flight to Los Angeles. Officials estimated it would take two days to ferry out the 30,000 tourists who were being put up in temporary refuges or hotel areas converted to shelters. Some 26,000 of those were foreigners, primarily from the United States, Canada and Great Britain. A boat was on its way with humanitarian aid for thousands in the state of Baja California Sur without services, and authorities were working to restore utilities. Emergency officials in Baja California reported that 135 people were treated for minor injuries. But surprisingly for a hurricane of this intensity there were no reports so far of fatalities directly related to Odile. But a new storm threatened to whip the region in days to come. Tropical Storm Polo was projected to grow into a hurricane late by early Thursday and march parallel to the Mexican coast, with a possible brush with Los Cabos by Sunday, though its center was projected to stay off shore. Polo was located 185 miles (295 kilometers) south of Zihuatanejo with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, and was moving northwest at 12 mph. The hurricane center predicted that Polo could become a hurricane by Wednesday night or early Thursday. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said that by Wednesday morning, Odile had maximum sustained winds near 45 mph. It was centered about 65 miles (105 kilometers) south of Puerto Penasco, a tourist town known to many Americans as Rocky Point. It was moving to the northeast near 6 mph (9 kph). Meanwhile in the central Atlantic, Hurricane Edouard was a Category 1 storm with maximum sustained winds near 90 mph (150 kph). It was far from land, but the Hurricane Center said swells from Edouard would begin affecting parts of the U.S. East Coast north of Florida, likely causing life-threatening rip current conditions. A five-day tracker forecast plots the path of tropical storm Odile as it heads inland on Wednesday into the Phoenix, Tucson and Mesa areas of Arizona amid warnings of flash floods .

Scientists at the University of Hertfordshire spent 10 years creating the map using a 8.2ft (2.5 metre) mirror on the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) in the Canary Islands. The chart shows the visible part of the northern region of our home galaxy and includes details on different features for each of the 219 million detected objects. The INT programme charted all the stars brighter than 20th magnitude – or one million times fainter than can be seen with the human eye.

This image was taken by an amateur photographer at in Dorset . The Milky Way is thought to be 120,000 light years across and contains more than 200 billion stars. This makes it a ‘middleweight’ galaxy with the largest galaxy known, IC 1101, containing more than 100 trillion stars. On a clear night, when you look up into the night sky the most you can see from any one point on the Earth is about 2,500 stars. Like more than two-thirds of the known galaxies, the Milky Way has a spiral shape. At the centre of the spiral, a lot of energy and, occasionally, vivid flares are created. Astronomers believe the Milky Way wasn’t always a stunning barred spiral. It formed into its current size by ‘eating’ other galaxies. Bright areas show stellar regions. The brighter the section, the more stars are packed into that area. Our view of the Milky Way's disk is also edge on, which means astronomers have to create a picture from the inside out to study it. Scientists say this new map gives them a new and vivid insight into the structure of this vast system of stars, gas and dust. They claim it will give all of us new and vivid insight into the structure of the vast system of stars, gas and dust in which we live. It follows another map released earlier this month showing Laniakea - the gigantic super-cluster of galaxies that contains our own Milky Way. The word means 'immeasurable heaven' in Hawaiian - an appropriate description for a structure 500 million light years across that contains 100,000 galaxies and the mass of a hundred quadrillion suns. Scientists have long-known that galaxies are not distributed randomly but congregate together in clusters. On the largest scales, galaxies are strung out like pearls, forming glowing 'filaments'. Where these intersect they produce enormous 'superclusters' of galaxies whose motion is affected by gravity. The Milky Way sits near the edge of one such supercluster, the first to have its size mapped by astronomers.","Astronomers created the map using a 8.2ft mirror on the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) in the Canary Islands .

"James Brown's daughter has revealed how growing up watching her father beat her mother led her to accept an abusive relationship as the norm. While the recent biopic Get On Up focused on the rise of the performer best known as the Godfather of Soul, the Sex Machine and the hardest working man in show-business, Yamma Brown paints a very different picture in her memoir Cold Sweat: My Father James Brown and Me. The youngest daughter from Brown’s marriage to second wife Deirdre Jenkins, Yamma recalls ‘the whole house shaking with my father’s crazy rage’ when he would lose his temper. Scroll down for video . Yamma Brown, the youngest daughter from the Godfather of Soul's second marriage, says seeing domestic violence at a young age led her to accept it in her own marriage for ten years . ‘Whenever he’d start, my sister Deanna and I would run for cover, usually in a closet or under our beds, and cry quietly into our cupped hands,’ writes Yamma. She recalls witnessing one of the terrifying beatings when she was just five years old. ‘My mother was dressed in her blue and white robe. Her legs were splayed wide open and my father was straddling her, pummeling her with clenched fists. ‘Doosh. Thud. Doosh. Thud. Blood spurted from my mother’s face. She started thrashing around, kicking her legs, holding up her arms to ward off the punches and trying to break free, trying to save herself.’ Eventally Yamma’s mom left the singer because she feared he might kill her. The never didn’t beat his children, but Yamma writes that the ‘damage had already been done’ from growing up seeing what her mom was subjected to. Brown, pictured with Michael Jackson, was best known as the Godfather of Soul, the Sex Machine and the hardest working man in show-business prior to his death on Christmas Day 2006 . ‘I’d been programmed to accept abuse as part of life… witnessing my father beating on my mother would have a profound effect on me.’ While working as a pharmacist at DeKalb Medical Center in Atlanta, Yamma met Darren Lumar, a six feet, five inches tall and 280 pound former baseball player turned investment banker. All seemed to be going well between the couple and Lumar asked Yamma’s father for his daughter’s hand in marriage after they’d been dating for just two months. The couple moved in together and Yamma writes that she quickly got to see another side of Lumar. She noticed that he would get jealous and had an angry, aggressive side that she hadn’t previously noticed. One day when she told Lumar that she was going shopping, he accused her of seeing another man. While the recent biopic Get On Up, left,  focused on the rise of the performer, Yamma Brown paints a very different picture in her memoir Cold Sweat: My Father James Brown and Me . When she tried to walk out after he had shouted at her, he followed and even pushed her to the ground outside their apartment building. Yamma writes that she regrets not walking away from the relationship after that first incident but instead ‘I made the decision to stay with Darren. I loved him.’ Instead she stayed with him for the next ten years during which she says she endured countless beatings. ‘It wasn’t until a decade later, when I was lying on that cold tile floor, with my head pounding and my vision blurred from being punched in the face, that I finally saw my marriage with absolute clarity, and I knew it was over. I’m not sure what was different about that time. Maybe Darren had finally beaten the pretense out of me, but suddenly after ten years of false hope and make-believe, there was nothing left but the bare and brutal truth.’","Yamma Brown says seeing domestic violence at a young age led her to accept it in her own marriage for ten years .

"Privacy row: Google are being sued over the way they harvest users' personal information to target them with adverts . A group of Apple iPhone and iPad users will sue Google for secretly tracking their browsing habits so they can bombard them with targeted adverts. Judith Vidal-Hall, Robert Hann and Marc . Bradshaw, who all use Apple's Safari browser, today won the right for the High Court to hear their claim. Google argued that the High Court in London did not have jurisdiction to hear the case and said it should instead be heard in California. The claimants, known as Safari Users Against Google's Secret Tracking, accuse Google of bypassing security settings in order to track their online browsing and target them with adverts. Today Mr Justice Tugendhat, sitting in the High Court, ruled that the courts were the 'appropriate jurisdiction' to try their claims. A group spokesman said: 'The Google argument that any trial should take place in California has not been accepted by the judge.' They say Google's 'clandestine' tracking and collation of internet usage between summer 2011 and spring 2012 has led to distress and embarrassment among UK users. They argued in court that Google's bid to block a trial was 'misconceived' and the company should 'answer to British justice'. They are accusing Google of misuse of private information, breach of confidence and breaking data protection laws. Google provides services including email and search facilities to web users for free, Mr Justice Tugendhat said. 'It . can do this because it collects information from the users of its . services which it then processes in such a way that it can sell to . suppliers what appears as space on the users' screens. 'This . can be used by them for advertisements which are targeted at the . apparent interests of the users of devices who access the internet', the . judge said. Privacy case: Google argued that the case should not go before the High Court and should instead be heard in California instead. They lost the battle and it will now go to trial . 'What each of . the claimants claims in the present case is that they have suffered . acute distress and anxiety. None of them claims any financial or special . damage.' Anthony White QC, for Google, had argued the information was not in fact private. 'It . is anonymous. The aggregation of such information sent to separate . websites and advertising services cannot make it private information. Court battle: The trio of internet users taking action against Google were all users of Apple's Safari broswer on iPad or iPhone . 'One . hundred times zero is zero, so one hundred pieces of non-private . information cannot become private information when collected together.' But the judge said: 'I find this a surprising submission to be made on behalf of Google Inc. 'It would not collect and collate the information unless doing so enabled it to produce something of value. 'The . value it produces is the facility for targeted advertising of which the . claimants complain, and which yields the spectacular revenues for which . Google Inc is famous', the judge said. 'I am satisfied that there is a serious issue to be tried in each of the claimants' claims for misuse of private information.' A Google spokeswoman said: 'A case almost identical to this one was dismissed in its entirety three months ago in the US. 'We still don't think that this case meets the standards required in the UK for it to go to trial, and we'll be appealing today's ruling.' Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said: 'It's absolutely right people are able to access justice in Britain when the issue concerns a company that has a significant presence here and offers services to millions of British people. 'This is an important case for privacy regulation, as it involved users making a specific choice about sharing data and being tracked that was not respected by Google. 'It is an important principle that people are able to control who collects their information and how it is used and this case has the potential to enhance consumer protection and strengthen privacy in a number of areas. It is critical that companies respect the choices we make as consumers and this case could be a significant deterrent in future.' No date has yet been set for the full hearing.","Trio are suing Google for using adverts tailored to browsing history .

"A former middle school band teacher has been suspended after being accused of having sex with a 14-year-old student. Bridgett Szychulski, 31, was the band teacher for the Lenape Middle School in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, at the time of the alleged incident in 2012. She was arraigned on Tuesday afternoon on charges including involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, aggravated indecent assault, indecent assault and statutory sexual assault. Bridgett Szychulski's attorney has sought leniency for his client and told the judge that the mother of one was in the middle of a complicated pregnancy . Szychulski is accused of having sex with the 14-year-old boy ‘at least’ three times - once in her vehicle and twice at the middle school, including her office and a storage room near the band room. District Judge Regina Armitage set bail at $500,000 unsecured. He also banned her from having contact with juveniles other than her 4-year-old son, or from contacting any Central Bucks students or employees. Her attorney, William Goldman, had sought leniency for his client’s bail conditions and told the judge that Szychulski is in the middle of a complicated pregnancy. The DA's Office had begun investigating the case in the middle of last week after the alleged abuse had been reported to Childline.

"When Mary Monaghan, now 64, was sent to live in America aged two, the Irish Catholic nuns who put her on the boat thought they were sending her to a better life. Tragically, nothing could have been further from the truth for not only was her adoptive father William O'Brien violent, he was a predatory paedophile as well. Now Ms Monaghan has questioned why nothing was done to help her - and why checks that would have revealed O'Brien's desire for children, were not done. Tragedy: Mary Monaghan was handed to a paedophile by nuns who ran the baby home where she was born . Innocent: Mary pictured as a little girl around the time of her adoption by a couple in California . One of an estimated 60,000 children forcibly given up for adoption by nuns running the Republic of Ireland's mother and baby homes in the 1950s and 60s, Ms Monaghan was a toddler when she was torn from her mother Theresa's arms and sent to start a new life. 'My . mother was a fallen woman,' says Ms Monaghan, who now lives in Massachusetts. 'I really do not remember a lot [about the actual moment]. 'But even though you're so young, you . still have feelings. You remember being ripped away even if you don't . remember the physicalities of it.' To the outside world, her new family appeared perfect for a lonely child taken from her mother and transported more than 5,000 miles away to California. Mary's new father, William, was a prosperous businessman and well-respected in the local community, while her mother was a kind and decent woman. 'She was indeed a nice person,' adds Ms Monaghan. Her father, however, was a different story entirely. 'When I first got there, I would often be ill,' she says of her early years with the family. 'I would have all kinds of allergies and break out because I was allergic to the food.' But worse was to come. 'My . memories [of childhood] are terrible,' Ms Monaghan says, sadly. 'I was physically punished for not being able to . eat. 'If I did what a little child does and wet the bed, then I was . literally put in the toilet. Then the sexual abuse started and it just . progressed. 'I had to be kept in my little routine as it were, so I tried . to break away. It was all systematic. It was very serious . paedophile thinking.' With the O'Briens keeping up appearances in front of friends and neighbours, the bewildered little girl found herself alone and with no one to turn to. Scandal: Ireland's historic adoption scandal was compounded by the recent discovery of a mass grave at Tuam . Grim: More than 2000 children were sent to families in America by nuns during the 1950s and 60s . 'I . could not perceive of any way of doing something and I had to protect myself. Because if I had said something and it had come to light, then I probably would not have lived . another day. 'And that is not an exaggeration. He had the world fooled.' The abuse lasted throughout her childhood with Mary fleeing her abusive family as soon as she was old enough. But the impact of her traumatic childhood - and the battle to find her real mother that came after - have left her scarred. Worse still was living with the knowledge that nuns handling the adoption failed to speak to Mr O'Brien beforehand and indeed make any sort of inquiries at all. In the event, only Mrs O'Brien was investigated by adoption agencies, with her very niceness inadvertently resulting in Mary's nightmarish childhood. Tragic: Many of the so-called fallen women to give birth at the homes had their children taken without consent . Adoption: Between 40,000 and 60,000 children were given up for adoption by nuns during the 50s and 60s . 'I . think if they did proper vetting, I wouldn't have been placed in that . household,' she says. 'How do I feel now? Well, it's been a . lot to overcome. 'I still have flashbacks sometimes and I still struggle . with substance abuse occasionally. And I have been diagnosed with . post-traumatic stress disorder.' Although Ms Monaghan did eventually find her birth mother, it wasn't until she was 52 that she was able to come to London to meet her. 'Well, . that was quite a moment when we first met,' she smiles. 'I went up to her and I . hugged her and she froze. She literally froze. So it came through to me . that I needed to tread lightly.' Tragically, her mother's shame at being an unwed parent followed her to London and Ms Monaghan says she was very reluctant to admit the truth to her Irish family. 'It was very clear that I was to keep my . mouth shut. That I was a secret. That I was a long lost cousin. I did . play along even though it was hard. But some people did guess.' The pair had just 10 years together, with Mary's mother Theresa dying in 2010. 'It's just unfortunate that she had to take so much shame to her grave,' she adds. 'It just isn't right.' Mary Monaghan's story appears on This World: Ireland's Lost Babies, tonight at 9pm on BBC2 .","Mary Monaghan, 64, was two when she was adopted by a U.S couple .

The 24-year-old Indiana native says she hasn't heard from the Weiner since she dropped a bombshell on the married former U.S. Congressman's campaign for New York mayor in June 2013 - revealing that she exchanged dirty pictures with him, even after he publicly claimed to have cleaned up his act. But, Leathers said she likes to think that Weiner is still watching her. He remained Facebook friends with her until December and still hasn't blocked her on Twitter, she claims. 'I think he likes it when I talk about him, even when I’m making fun of him, it’s just that he likes the attention,' she laughs. 'I think he’s seen all my new porn scenes, too.' Leathers has pledged not to do porn again, but says she always been an exhibitionist and couldn't stay away from the spotlight . After Leathers texted her way into the spotlight last summer, she appeared in a hardcore porn video called 'Weiner and Me,' in which she played out some of the saucy scene she and Weiner had texted about. She followed up the adult movie shoot with surgery - a boob job to increase her cup size to a D, rhinoplasty, liposuction and labiaplasty. She later tried to auction off a jar with the discarded bits of her privates. In an interview last year with MailOnline, she called her first porn short a 'one-time thing' and said she wouldn't be making any more XXX videos.

UK airports: Birmingham and London City offer unlimited free wifi - while Heathrow charges the most . This is in stark contrast to Russia and Italy where all their main airports offer unlimited free access, as do almost half (48 per cent) of Europe's 50 busiest airports. The survey also found that a third of travellers would only be prepared to pay £1 for an hour of wifi – significantly less than Dusseldorf and Lisbon Airports which are the most expensive in the study, charging £8 for two hours. Lisbon Airport is also the most expensive for one hour along with Brussels Airport, both of which charge £4 for an hour. Infographic reveals how airports perform for passenger wifi . However all at least offer a limited period of free wifi, unlike Berlin's Tegel Airport and Turkey's Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen Airport, both of which offer passengers no free WiFi allowance at all.

"A Tennessee couple has been arrested for renting out their four daughters, aged 5 to 16, to appear in black market child porn. Connie, 40, and Ronnie Lee McCall, 61, were keeping their daughters in a deplorably dirty Johnson City trailer, authorities say, before it emerged they were selling them for sex. The prosecuting attorney called the case, in which the parents are believed to have been strung out on bath salts, one of the worst he’s seen in his 20-year career. Depraved: Ronnie Lee McCall, 61, (right) and wife Connie (left) 40, are charged with renting out their young daughters aged 5 through 17 to perform sex acts in child porn . The sickening saga began in the summer of 2012, when the girls aged 5, 12, 15, 17, were removed from the home after calls to protective services. District Attorney Tony Clark told WCYB that Johnson City Police first discovered the despicable conditions. ‘When the youngest child was taken in, several if not all of her teeth were rotted. There was animal waste inside the home,’ he said. The youngest also reportedly had flea bites, head and body lice, and ring worm. Deplorable: The girls' saga began after police found the girls were living in squalid conditions in this Johnson City, Tennessee trailer . Plea: Authorities say the children were being taken to addresses in Tennessee and South Carolina, where they were filmed performing sex acts. Ronnie Lee McCall pleaded not guilty on Friday . Strung out: The couple was reportedly strung out on bath salts as they sold their children into the sex trade. Connie McCall is slated to enter her plea on Wednesday . ‘The amount of tooth decay, you can imagine, was extremely painful. She had black teeth, and holes in all the teeth, just really inexcusable,’ said Debbie Dunn with the city’s police department. After questioning the girls, investigators realized the girls were being subjected to more than just parental neglect. 'There was money that changed hands between the individuals that were taking pictures and the parents,’ Clark revealed. ‘The children said that they had been taken to various locations and performing sex acts with an adult.’ What’s more, the sex acts were reportedly filmed for black market child pornography. 'The children were at my house constantly,' said their former neighbor Marsha Pierce, who was nonetheless shocked when she learned the charges against the McCalls . When it was then discovered that the McCalls were taking their young daughters to not only a Tennessee address but also across state lines to South Carolina, the case was handed to the FBI. ‘When you have parents allegedly making money off their kids through pornography and exploitation, even after 20 years, it's one of the worst cases I've ever seen,’ Clark told WATE. Clark also said that the Washington County man believed to have had sexual contact with and who filmed the girls has since committed suicide. The girls are now living in foster care and in good condition. Officials hope they can be adopted as a group so that they may stay as a family.

"Accused: Joshu Sasaki, 105, allegedly groped and sexually harassed female students for 50 years . A 105-year-old Zen Buddhist master has been accused of sexually assaulting his female students during private teaching sessions. Joshu Sasaki, best known for being the teacher of artist Leonard Cohen, has allegedly groped and sexually harassed women across the U.S. for over 50 years. An independent council of Buddhist leaders recently admitted to ignoring years of accusations against the famously charismatic ‘roshi’. Last month, a ‘witnessing council’ of . senior teachers of Mr Sasaki’s Zen Buddhist community published a . statement, admitting that the have ‘struggled with our teacher Joshu . Sasaki Roshi’s sexual misconduct for a significant portion of his career . in the United States’. Originally from Japan, Mr Sasaki moved to the U.S. in 1962 where he set up the . Rinzai-ji Zen Center in Los Angeles and the Mount Baldy Zen Center, in . Mt Baldy, California. As well as heading these facilities, he has also been teaching at Zen centers across the . United States. Accusations . have been circulating since the early 70s and in 1997 members of the Mount . Baldy Zen Center put forward a letter to the then 90-year-old Mr Sasaki, . with no consequences. It . was not until a letter was published on the popular practitioners' website Sweeping Zen in October last year that the true story of the . abusive Zen master begun to unfold. Eshu . Martin, a former student of Mr Sasaki and monk in Rinzai-ji Zen Center accused Mr Sasaki of getting away with decades of sexual abuse. Mr Martin wrote: ‘His . career of misconduct has run the gamut from frequent and repeated . non-consensual groping of female students during interview, to sexually . coercive after hours “tea” meetings, to affairs and sexual interference . in the marriages and relationships of his students.' He also said that those who have . confronted Mr Sasaki and the Rinzai-ji Zen Center have found themselves . alienated or excommunicated from the center, whilst others have . resigned ‘in frustration’. ‘For . decades, Joshu Roshi’s behaviour has been ignored, hushed up, . downplayed, justified, and defended by the monks and students that . remain loyal to him.’ Taking advantage: Mr Sasaki is accused of abusing his female students at Mount Baldy Zen Center in Mount Baldy California and at Zen Buddhist temples across the U.S. The letter rocked the . close-knit Zen Buddhist community where a majority of practitioners are . aware of and have studied Mr Sasaki. Shortly afterwards the letter's . publication senior teachers of the ‘independent witnessing council’ began to investigate Mr Sasaki’s behaviour towards his female students. Zen Buddhism derives from Mahayana Buddhism and is believed to have originated in China during the 6th century. The Rinzai-tradition practiced by Mr Sasaki focuses on ‘kensho’, which is the insight to one’s true nature. True knowledge and insight into . ‘kensho’ - finding inner peace -  is reached through meditation and . self-study, as taught by Mr Sakasi. Several victims, interviewed by the New York Times, said they were shunned or ignored when they brought up the abuse. Nikki Stubbs, who spent three years . studying under Mr Sasaki in the early 00s, said that when she spoke up . about Mr Sasaki touching her breasts during private lessons and asking . her to massage his penis, a monk told her 'sexualizing was teaching . for particular women'. His theory, she told the newspaper. was that ‘such physicality could check a woman’s overly strong ego’. Another victim, who has been kept . anonymous, studied under Mr Sasaki at Mount Baldy Zen Centre in the 90s. She said Mr Sasaki would justify groping her during ‘sanzen’, private . meetings, by saying ‘True love is giving yourself to everything.’ Long-time fiend: Mr Sasaki set up the Zen centers in Mount Baldy, pictured, and Los Angeles shortly after his arrival in the U.S. in 1962 when it is believed the abuse began . The witnessing council, part of the American Zen Teachers Association and have no authoritative powers. Their statement admitting having knowledge of the abuse was released in January. Mr Sasaki retired completely form teaching in January last year due to ill health. Bob Mammoser, a resident monk at the Rinzai-ji Zen Center said Mr Sasaki’s importance to helping Zen Buddhists in their practice had been overlooked as a result of the allegations, and compared the abuse to a marriage. ‘It seems to be the kind of thing that, you get the person as a whole, good and bad, just like you marry somebody and you get their strengths and wonderful qualities as well as their weaknesses.’ He said that there are plans to have a meeting at the center to decide what actions to take, or whether to take any actions at all.","Elderly Zen Buddhist teacher accused of sexually abusing his students .

"Chemicals in make-up, perfume and plastic containers could be behind a surge in the incidence of asthma in children, researchers warned yesterday. Scientists have found that babies exposed to high levels of phthalates while in the womb are up to 78 per cent more at risk of the condition. They think the chemicals may be causing foetuses’ airways to become more sensitive, making them susceptible to asthma in their childhood years. The study says it is also worth considering cutting back on using any scented products – cosmetics, perfumes, air fresheners and detergents (File photos) The academics are urging parents to reduce the risk by avoiding using plastic containers, perfume and heavily scented washing detergents. Asthma rates in children in the UK have increased by between two and three times since the 1950s and a similar trend has been noticed in other Western countries. Researchers at the University of Columbia in New York measured the level of two types of phthalates – butylbenzyl and di-n-butyl – in the urine of 300 pregnant women. The mothers were then given questionnaires when their children were aged five, six, seven, nine and 11 to determine if they had asthma symptoms. The study, published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, found that children born to women with the highest levels of butylbenzyl phthalate were 72 per cent more likely to develop asthma. ‘There are some simple steps families can take. Avoid using plastic containers and as much as you can store your food in glass jars in the fridge' Those with the highest levels of di-n-butyl phthalate were 78 per cent more at risk compared to women with low levels. Dr Robin Whyatt, of Columbia University, said: ‘These chemicals are very widely used in very high volume and they are not generally listed on labels. ‘There are some simple steps families can take. Avoid using plastic containers and as much as you can store your food in glass jars in the fridge. ‘Never microwave in plastic. It is also worth considering cutting back on using any scented products – cosmetics, perfumes, air fresheners and detergents.’ She also suggested women check their make-up on the internet for phthalates. Around 5.4million Britons have asthma, including 1.1million children, and it causes up to 1,250 deaths a year. Dr Samantha Walker, director of research and policy at the charity Asthma UK, said: ‘It is a complex condition and these new research findings need to be explored in much more detail.’","Babies exposed to high levels of phthalates in the womb are up to 78% more at risk .

"The romance of  journeying to your destination is clearly alive and well as these entries to a photographic competition entitled On The Road show. The images from 400 submitted from all over the world were the  winners of a competition run by the Society of International Travel and Tourism Photographers. And it was a civil engineer from Bristol who walked away with the top prize with his black and white shot of a car in the Eurotunnel. Jonathan Millard, 37, said: 'My photo was taken en route to a skiing holiday this year to the French Alps with friends and our 10-month-old daughter...my first ride in the Eurotunnel. 'I thought putting the camera on the ground with a fairly wide angle would make for an interesting perspective. It was the first of many holiday photos.' American Jim Shepka, from Windham, New Hampshire, came second with his moody black and white shot of Cape Neddick Lighthouse in York, Maine, while third place was taken by another Brit, Chris Upton, who picked out an iconic yellow taxi from the walkway of Brooklyn Bridge in New York. Chris, a travel and landscape photographer from Southwell, Nottinghamshire, said: 'I enjoy photographing throughout the UK but have also been fortunate to have visited some inspirational locations around the world. 'The opportunity to visit these magical places, meet the people and observe their culture, traditions and landscape has been a wonderful experience. 'My goal is always to capture the spirit of this in my images and to create an emotion in the viewer to learn more or indeed visit these locations themselves'. First prize: 'I thought putting the camera on the ground with a fairly wide angle would make for an interesting perspective,' said British photographer Jonathan Millard. Competition judge Phil Jones said, 'The very high standard made judging very difficult, but this  image caught the judges' eye with its leading lines, and the low camera angle gave greater feeling of connectivity to the 'road' which fitted nicely with the theme of the competition.' Second prize: Jim Shepka was second placed for his moody shot of Cape Neddick Lighthouse in York, Maine, which was built in 1874 . Runners up: 'I took this photo (left) whilst on my journey through Orissa, India in which I visited many tribal villages,' said Polish born Irena Sowinska. 'I encountered  children with a spontaneity and joyfulness that was very moving.' Right, third placed Chris Upton was also highly commended fort his image of a bike propped up against a coffee shop covered in number plates in Crested Butte, Colorado. 'I just happened to come across this bike while heading over to buy a cup of coffee,' he said. Third place went to another Brit, Chris Upton, of an iconic yellow taxi on Brooklyn Bridge, New York. Chris, from Southwell, Nottinghamshire, said: 'The shutter speed was quite tricky as I wanted to get the right amount of motion in the cars but  avoid camera shake. It was then a question of waiting until a yellow cab came by...' Highly recommended for this dramatic and colourful shot, Chris Upton's photograph of a lighthouse in Maine, the Pemaquid lighthouse also was picked out by the judges. 'It was taken at dawn and I composed the image using the rocks and the dawn sky to lead to the focal point of the image, the lighthouse,' said Chris of his amazing image . Commended: Californian Todd Arbini's 'Rolling green hills of Livermore.' The professional photographer said of this ethereal shot, 'I went for a drive on Morgan Territory Road which goes up the south west side of Mount Diablo [in California]. This view is looking back on the Livermore hills at dusk.' Almost Turneresque: The quality of the light is striking in this photograph by Todd Arbini which was also commended. Both pictures were taken on travels round his home state of California, this one of a road disappearing off into the sunset at Brentwood. Commended: Former Lancashire Evening Post photographer Georgina Brewster was also highly commended for her picture of the Houses of Parliament from the banks of the Thames. The 35 year old from Skipton in the Yorkshire Dales, who now concentrates on weddings and lifestyle photographs, took her picture from the South Bank on a weekend break in London with her husband and seven year old daughter. Commended:  Manuel Ramos from Santiago, Chile was highly commended for his 'on the road' shot going into a national park. The 37 year old architect said: 'This was taken on the road heading to Torres del Paine National Park, located in the Chilean Patagonia, Magallanes Province.' Commended: Tamal Mitra, 25, from Kolkata, India got this evocative sunset shot from his home town. The Android game programmer said: 'Prinsep Ghat is a Ghat built during the British Raj, along the river bank of Hooghly and on its bank on Kolkata side. I was taking photographs there with my friends when I saw a couple who had hired a boat for a ride. The sun was setting  that time, and that produced an amazing silhouette.'","First prize went to a black and while photo of the Eurostar with an interesting low angle .

"It was a perfect September day; the air still with small white clouds scudding across a blue sky, the sun warm on our backs. Bees buzzed and small white butterflies fluttered around the wild flowers that lined the deep lane. With the church spire of a peaceful village in the distance, we could have been on a Sunday walk along an ancient drovers' road. But when we stopped, our guide sharply focused our attentions well away from thoughts of a rural idyll. He revealed that we were close to the spot on the Sunken Road where Geoffrey Malins, an official British war photographer, set up his camera to capture the most dramatic shot of his life - as the German redoubt of Hawthorn Ridge was blown sky-high early on July 1, 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme. Lest we forget: The Thiepval Memorial to more than 72,000 British and French dead of the Somme . It would last until November 13, by which time the British had suffered 420,000 casualties - 60,000 on the first day alone. Our guide, a military historian, knew his stuff and told it well. He knew when to insert an anecdote or flesh out a character, and had an engaging habit of referring to General Douglas Haig, commander of the British Expeditionary Force in France, as Dougie Haig. The Sunken Road was our last stop on an absorbing four-day tour of the Western Front, that shifting barbed-wire battle line between the Allied and German armies running some 440 miles from the Belgian coast to the Swiss border. Over the top: British soldiers advance during the Battle of the Somme in July 1916 . Our group of 21, mainly middle-aged plus, included a father and his quiet, observant 14-year-old son who had a knack of finding fragments of weapons and ammunition. We visited battlefields, cemeteries, field stations, memorial parks, a magnificent museum and a clutch of quirky cafes, once houses close to the front line, now with an assortment of war memorabilia, often including trenches in the back garden. Our trip was moving, heart-rending, often shocking, sometimes light-hearted - but never depressing. One evening at 8pm we stood, part of a silent crowd, at the great Menin Gate of Ypres as the buglers of the local fire brigade sounded Last Post as they have done every evening, except during the Second World War, since November 11, 1929, when the tradition was established. The words 'They shall not grow old as we that are left grow old', often spoken by a visiting dignitary, still touch the heart. The Gate, more a magnificent arch, was built on the crossroads where British and Commonwealth troops marched east out of the town to the battlefields of the Ypres Salient. Thousands would never return. Panels of white Portland stone, chiselled with the names of 54,389 men missing in those battles, line the arch; the Hall of Memory. The silence was intense as the last bugle note died away. Dymphna (right) visited the great Menin Gate at Ypres, where the buglers sound Last Post every evening . Battles result in cemeteries and memorials, and there are hundreds of them, from small plots on the edge of a village to the majestic splendour of the Thiepval Memorial to the 72,000-plus British and South African men missing on the Somme and with no known grave. There is an atmosphere of tranquillity in every carefully tended cemetery, with seasonal flowers or evergreens growing in the small strip of earth in front of each white stone grave. Some of our group had requested 'special visits' to cemeteries where relatives were buried. As my father had survived the Battle of Loos in 1915, I was curious about the site - as was another in our group, Roz Taylor, who by an extraordinary coincidence also had a father who had survived the carnage. The battle lasted 19 days and was a failure. The British used gas for the first time, some blowing back over their own troops. Rudyard Kipling's only son fell at Loos; Robert Graves survived and wrote vividly about his experiences in his autobiography Goodbye To All That. Poignant: Visitors’ crosses in barbed wire at the preserved battlefield of Hill 62 just south-east of Ypres . Roz had brought a copy of her father's war diary and showed me part of his entry for a 6am bombardment at Loos. He wrote: '...the sight of men stumbling into reddish mist [gas] then they sat down suddenly as though tying up their shoes. After a while realized with a shock they were dead.' My father, only slightly gassed, got a bullet through his right arm and was discharged. Earlier that year, he had fought with the Royal Munster Fusiliers at the Battle of Aubers Ridge, another disaster with high casualties. As a child, I thought his picture of a mounted priest standing on a muddy track in front of a group of weary soldiers rather gloomy. As he never talked about the war, I understood the picture's significance only after his death. 'The Last General Absolution of the Munsters at Rue du Bois' took place on May 8, 1915, the eve of the battle of Aubers Ridge. Painted by Fortunino Matania, it caused 'a minor emotional storm' when it appeared in The Sphere magazine in November 1916. Sadly, bombs in the Second World War destroyed the original. My copy will go to my third grandson, who, aged 13, knew more about my father's war than I did at the age of 70. Fleshing out a character: Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig (left) with General Francois Anthoine and, right, First World War trenches at the Sanctuary Wood Museum at Hill 62, south-east of Ypres . Fortunately, the Great War is now on the school curriculum and the course includes battlefield trips. I saw a school group at the Menin Gate and another walking decorously on a conducted tour through trenches at the Vimy Ridge memorial park. Cheery participants in a 10k Sunday run streamed past us as we walked to the excellent interpretative centre in what is now a green 250-acre park - with areas of unexploded bombs safely fenced off. When the Canadians attacked Vimy Ridge in snow and sleet at 5.30am on Easter Monday, April 9, 1917, they fought on devastated war-scarred land, but took the ridge. The guide pointed across the trenches. 'The German front line was there, close enough for the troops to shout across to each other.' One German is said to have warned: 'Hello Tommy, you better be careful. We're moving out, the Prussians are coming and they're very good shots.' Sombre: The group visited the German cemetery at Langemarck where four brooding bronze soldiers guard their fallen comrades buried under black stone slabs without headstones . Somehow it was fitting that we visited the sombre and severe German cemetery at Langemarck early one misty grey morning. Here, four brooding bronze soldiers guard their fallen comrades buried under black stone slabs without headstones, many to a grave. There was no sense of tranquillity here and the folly and waste of war somehow seemed so much more forceful. It was forceful, too, at the preserved battlefield of Hill 62 just south-east of Ypres. The man-made hill was built-up spoil from the adjacent 19th Century railway. New growth has slightly softened the scars and mine craters but randomly scattered lumps of concrete and a massive ruined pillbox, a good 3ft thick and partially covered by brambles, give the place a brutal air. A vital vantage point, the hill changed hands several times during intense fighting. Ypres itself never fell into enemy hands but the bodies of many soldiers from both sides still lie below this battlefield. The adjacent privately owned Sanctuary Wood Museum and cafe is an oldstyle tourist attraction. The remains of trenches, the heaps of shrapnel, barbed wire and rusting weapons in the garden, together with the assortment of military memorabilia in the museum - badges, scraps of letters, yellowing newspaper cuttings, caps, spiked German helmets, bayonets, posters - all touch the heart. Preserving history: The Sanctuary Wood Museum displays an assortment of military memorabilia . On the drive back to the coast, some of us wondered why, when still 80 miles from Calais, lunch was to be at seasidesounding Ocean Villas. Blame the British Tommy, who, unfazed by foreign words, found a simple English equivalent. Ypres became 'Wipers'; Wytschaete, a much fought-over ridge village, 'White Sheet', and Auchonvillers - a village behind British lines - 'Ocean Villas'. There was so much more to see and ponder, such as the astonishing smallness of the operating theatre, a windowless bunker, at the Essex Farm dressing station at Ypres Salient where both surgeon and patient could hear the thunder of the front line a few miles away; the plaque, also at Essex Farm, inscribed with the poem In Flanders Fields, written by Dr John McCrae after the death of his friend; the simple, moving comments in the visitors' books kept in the bronze boxes at the entrance to all Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries. No wonder people return to the First World War battlefields. One could never tire of such a deeply layered human subject.

"The stakes have been raised in the bidding war for New York's most iconic building after an anonymous Middle Eastern buyer offered $2.1 billion for the Empire State Building. The offer comes a week after real estate investor Rubin Schron made a $2 million cash offer for the building. The Malkin family who bought the building in 2002 want to turn a New York property portfolio, including the Empire State Building and 18 other buildings, into a publicly traded company. For sale: Rival bidders are competing to buy the Empire State Building . Joe Tabak, of . Princeton Holdings, and Philip Pilevsky, of Philips International, are said to be working with the Middle . Eastern bidder, according to the New York Post. 'To this guy, it’s like buying a . painting,' a source said about the unnamed bidder, who is not believed to be an Arab. 'It will be very hard . to stop them. They will keep ratcheting up [the offer] until they get . it.' The 102-storey building was valued at $2.3 billion in a filing with the Securities . and Exchange Commission. However, the city valued the Empire State Building, which is only 88 percent-occupied, at $775,009,000. Cash deal: Rubin Schron, left, made the first cash offer to Peter Malkin for the Empire State Building . Last chance: The Middle Eastern bidder sees the deal as the last chance to own the iconic building . Despite tax exemptions for energy . efficiency plans in the building, it still has to pay about $31 million a . year in property taxes. The building has 2.7 million square feet of commercial space, but its real financial draw is the money made from its observation decks on the 86th and 102nd floors. Opened with the push of a button from Washington DC in 1931, President Herbert Hoover ushered in another league for office buildings which would find its way through Hollywood pictures and endless skyline photographs as New York City's tallest building.Standing over a quarter of a mile in mid-town Manhattan, the Empire State Building pulls visitors 1,050 feet above the street to an observation deck on the 86th floor as well as one on their 102nd floor.In 1976 it had its 50 millionth visitor and in 1980 received its own zip code.Maintaining its original Art Deco interior though with expensive renovations, the building in 2007 was named 'America's Favorite Architecture' by the American Institute of Architects, 76 years after its opening. The final cost of the property and construction is estimated at $41 million after 410 days of construction and seven million hours of labor total.While the building offers 2.85 million square feet for rent, the possible move to go public would make it a real estate investment in its stock ownership. The observation decks draw in about four . million visitors a year, and made $60 million in profits in 2010, . according to the New York Times. The Malkin family bought the property in 2002 and, after much wrangling, gained total control of it in 2010. A spokesman for the . Malkin family said, 'We received last week two unsolicited bids to purchase . the Empire State Building ,,, We are reviewing the offers and . their terms.' Mr Pilevsky said he was contacted by the Middle Eastern partners about making the cash bid. 'They view it as a last opportunity' to acquire the tower he told Bloomberg. The Empire State Building held its . own in the New York commercial real estate market -- even when Lehman's . bankruptcy sent rents tumbling and tenants negotiated leaner terms -- . helped by the expensive renovations to its Art Deco structure. Two years ago, the building's owners . embarked on a $500 million project to bring the skyscraper, completed in . 1931, to modern environmental standards. In its filing earlier this year, the . company said it currently plans to invest between $175 million and $215 . million of additional capital through the end of 2013, to continue to . renovate and reposition its properties. The first bidders for the building said their deal would allow investors to remain in the deal. Jason . Meister, an investment broker representing Mr Schron, said: 'Our bid wasn’t out of left field as it is the most iconic . building in the world.' 'It is important to consider that our . offer is for all cash with a $50 million nonrefundable deposit and may . very well exceed what the REIT stock ... ends up trading for.'","Two cash buyers compete for chance to own famous tower .

Flyers' other biggest annoyances were crying children on board a flight (67 per cent); not having enough leg room (48 per cent); and poor customer service from flight attendants (29 per cent). Scroll down for video . Air rage: A new poll of British travellers reveals that three quarters want to see reclining seat banned . 1. Being seated separately to those I'm travelling with - 73% . 2. When people in front of me recline their seats into my personal space - 66% . 3. Crying children - 64% . 4. Not enough leg room - 48% . 5. Poor customer service from the flight attendants - 29% . More than 73 per cent cited being split from people they were travelling with as their main concern, followed by 66 per cent who said they hated people in front of them reclining their plane seat, according to the survey by www.jetcost.co.uk. Some 2,411 Britons, all of whom had flown at least once in the past 12 months, were asked 'What are you biggest pet peeves when flying?'. All respondents who selected reclining seats as one of their pet peeves were asked 'Do you ever recline your own seat when you're flying?' with almost two thirds of the relevant respondents (64 per cent) admitting that they did. Those who said ‘yes’ were asked why they did this if it annoyed them so much when other people did. Nearly 40 per cent said it was to get more comfortable, while 32 per cent said it was to help them to get to sleep. However, when asked why they didn't like it when other passengers reclined their seats, the main response was that passengers felt it was rude behaviour 'to invade my limited leg space' (41 per cent). Room to move:  64% of passengers admit they are guilty of reclining their seat on board a plane . Thirty-nine per cent said the person in front reclining their seat prevented them from using their tray. Furthermore, 27 per cent of the total respondents admitted to having previously got in to some form of confrontation with a fellow passenger over either their own or another passenger’s reclining seat. Seventy-five per cent of respondents felt that reclining seats during flights should be banned. Furthermore, 12 per cent planned to invest in knee defenders before their next flight. Antoine Michelat, co-founder of Jetcost.co.uk, said: 'The issue of reclining seats has received a great deal of attention recently and it's got people wanting to purchase knee defenders to prevent others invading the limited leg space they already have during a flight. Room to move: 27% of passengers say they have got into a row with a passenger over reclining seats . 'But this carries with it the risk of being kicked off a flight if they choose to use them. 'A simple solution for this would be for passengers to stipulate when booking if they want a seat that reclines or not - if they do they're seated with others who also wish to recline their seats, if they don't then they'll be seated with others who don't wish to recline their seats. 'I think that banning the ability to recline your seat during a flight might be a tad drastic, but if people are going to continue being kicked off their flights over this, it may be the best solution in the long run.' Controversial: Two flights have been diverted in recent months because of passengers coming to blows over the use of the controversial Knee Defender gadget . Pet peeves: Not being seated with travelling companions, poor customer service and crying children feature . The $21.95 Knee Defender from Gadgetduck.com has been making headlines worldwide after two flights were forced to divert due to passengers fighting over its use on flights. The plastic gadget hooks on to the tray table to prevent the seat in front being reclined. It is currently being left up to airlines to enforce their policy on the use of the gadget, with Qantas and Virgin Australia banning them. Responding to another recent survey of airline passengers, Monarch Airlines announced earlier this year that they would be rolling out non-reclining seats across its fleet this year.","66% of travellers name reclining seats as biggest pet peeve when flying .

"Once again millions of television viewers are transporting themselves to another century under the guidance of Ken Burns. An estimated 9.1 million people watched the first episode of Burns' seven-part series on Theodore, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt on Sunday. PBS aired it twice Sunday to maximize attention; the Nielsen company's estimate was the combined viewership of both episodes. Scroll down for video . PBS' premiere episode of The Roosevelts: An Intimate History, was watched by a whopping 9.1 million viewers. In this June 12, 1919 photo provided by PBS, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt pose for a portrait with their children in Washington . Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns, pictured here as he walked through the museum at the Georgia home used by former President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Warm Springs, Georgia, last year, has had repeated massive successes for PBS. The premiere of his 1990 Civil War series was seen by over 10 million people . By way of comparison, the most-watched scripted series on the commercial networks last week, CBS' 'Under the Dome,' reached 6.6 million viewers, Nielsen said. 'Releasing a film is like having a conversation with your closest friends and family,' Burns said. 'I'm always struck by the thoughts and comments and how engaged the American people are. The fact that such a large audience tuned in ... is all the more rewarding.' This September 2014 photo shows the exterior of Theodore Roosevelt's birthplace at 28 E. 20th St. in New York. He was descended from early Dutch settlers who made their fortune in trade; he was Eleanor Roosevelt's uncle and Franklin's distant cousin . Burns' reputation-making 1990 series, 'Civil War,' had 10.5 million viewers for its premiere episode, Nielsen said. His 2007 film on World War II had 8.9 million, and 2012's 'Dust Bowl' documentary had 8.3 million, Nielsen said. Those historical numbers include viewing over a seven-day period; the 9 million figure for 'The Roosevelts: An Intimate History' will increase when people who catch up to that first episode throughout the week are counted. Otherwise, prime-time television was dominated by football and football-related programming last week. An estimated 7.1 million people watched the 'Miss America' competition on ABC.

"Families may have been overcharged £150 for their electricity bills, but it is hard to tell because the market is so complex, according to a senior figure at the energy regulator. Ian Marlee, a senior partner at Ofgem, was asked to respond to new figures from Labour suggesting the major energy suppliers had charged customers an average of £150 too much over the past three years. But he suggested it was not possible to establish whether this was the case, saying: ‘What was identified in our work is that there is actually not enough transparency to be able to actually look at that.’ Families may have been overcharged £150 for their electricity bills, but it is hard to tell because the market is so complex, according to a senior figure at the energy regulator . He said the regulator was ‘looking into it’ and was in the process of enacting major reforms which would make the market simpler for consumers to understand. Mr Marlee conceded there ‘wasn’t enough trading going on’ in the energy market but said the reforms would introduce more competition by helping independent suppliers break into the marketplace. Labour have accused the so-called Big Six energy giants, who supply electricity to 98 per cent of the country, of buying power from their own stations and then charging their customers over the market rate. Shadow energy spokesman Caroline Flint said their analysis of official figures suggested the firms were ripping off customers to the tune of nearly £4billion to boost profits. The research compared the prices at which these firms bought their electricity with those of the small supplier First Utility, and found it was higher. If the firms did sell to each other at an inflated price, they could stand accused of misleading Parliament because power company bosses who gave evidence to MPs last year claimed they only ‘self-supply’ a small amount of electricity or none at all. Miss Flint said: ‘These figures reveal the full extent of the way consumers have been overcharged for their electricity. Energy companies always blame wholesale costs when they put up bills, but it now looks like they’ve deliberately inflated prices to boost profits from their power stations. ‘The regulator Ofgem has serious questions to answer about why it has failed to monitor the way in which companies have bought electricity from themselves and why it has allowed these companies to overcharge their customers.’ Shadow energy minister Tom Greatrex added: ‘It is just not good enough for Ofgem to say it doesn’t know whether consumers are being overcharged – it’s the regulator’s job to know.’ Ian Marlee, a senior partner at Ofgem, was asked to respond to new figures from Labour suggesting the major energy suppliers had charged customers an average of £150 too much over the past three years . A few hours after Mr Marlee’s comment on Radio 4’s Today programme, Ofgem released a statement saying they did not believe the Big Six firms were overcharging customers as Labour claimed. An Ofgem spokesman said they had not seen details of Labour’s analysis, and ‘would clearly consider more detailed information’ from them in their next report. But he said: ‘Ofgem regularly looks at the relationship between wholesale and retail prices and our own analysis of the evidence does not support this allegation. Where we have found evidence that firms have not played by the rules we have acted. Since 2010 we have imposed over £75million of penalties and redress payments on the industry.’ All of the Big Six firms raised gas and electricity prices for customers by up to 10 per cent at the end of last year. Energy UK, representing the Big Six, said suppliers pay ‘the most competitive price they can for the gas and electricity they purchase’ and claimed Labour’s figures ‘don’t give the true picture’.","Ian Marlee said it wasn't 'transparent' whether customers overcharged .

"The report into the murder of Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane was publsihed today. The 38-year-old was shot at his north Belfast home by loyalist paramilitaries the Ulster Defence Association in 1989 . David Cameron said the Government was ‘deeply sorry’ yesterday after a report into the murder of solicitor Pat Finucane found the security services colluded with the loyalist terrorists who killed him. A review of the case by Sir Desmond de Silva, QC, found the father-of-three would probably not have been executed by the Ulster Defence Association without the encouragement of British agents. Sir Desmond said state employees ‘furthered and facilitated’ the shooting of the 38-year-old, who was gunned down in front of his family in 1989. But his finding that there was no evidence of an over-arching conspiracy involving ministers or security chiefs to target Mr Finucane sparked calls for a full public inquiry. The widow of murdered Belfast solicitor Mr  Finucane slammed a report into his death as 'a sham... a whitewash... a confidence trick'. Geraldine Finucane said Sir Desmond de Silva's report was 'not the truth' and renewed her call for a full public inquiry. In a Commons statement today, David Cameron admitted Mr Finucane might . still be alive had police and state agencies not colluded in his murder. The Prime Minister said the . 'appalling crime' was the result of 'shocking levels' of state collusion . and apologised on 'behalf of the government and the whole country'. The de Silva review into the 1989 killing found that state employees actively 'furthered and facilitated' the loyalist murder of Mr Finucane. But the victim's family have criticised the review, insisting only a full public inquiry will reveal the truth about his murder. The . 38-year-old was shot in front of his wife and children at home by . loyalist paramilitaries from the Ulster Defence Association in 1989. At a press conference after the review was published, Mrs Finucane accused the British Government of suppressing the truth while attempting to blame dead individuals and disbanded organisations while exonerating ministers, serving officers and existing security agencies. Mrs Finucane said: 'Yet another British government has engineered a suppression of the truth behind the murder of my husband, Pat Finucane. 'At every turn it is clear that this report has done exactly what was required - to give the benefit of the doubt to the state, its Cabinet and ministers, to the Army, to the intelligence services and to itself. 'At every turn, dead witnesses have been blamed and defunct agencies found wanting. Serving personnel and active state departments appear to have been excused. 'The dirt has been swept under the carpet without any serious attempt to lift the lid on what really happened to Pat and so many others. 'This report is a sham, this report is a whitewash, this report is a confidence trick dressed up as independent scrutiny and given invisible clothes of reliability. But most of all, most hurtful and insulting of all, this report is not the truth.' Mr Cameron told the Commons said the review had found the Army and Special Branch had advance notice of a series of assassinations planned by the loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), but nothing was done. Scroll down for video . Pat Finucane's widow Geraldine today arrived at the House of Parliament with her children John (left), Michael (centre) and Katherine at the Houses of Parliament in central London to read the review of the report into her husband's murder . The review found a 'relentless' effort to stop justice being done with Army officials giving the Ministry of Defence highly misleading and inaccurate information, Mr Cameron said. Successive UK Governments are accused of a 'wilful and abject failure' to properly control secret agents within paramilitary groups. Mr Cameron said: 'It is really shocking this happened in our country. Collusion demonstrated beyond any doubt by Sir Desmond, which included the involvement of state agencies in murder, is totally unacceptable. 'We do not defend our security forces or the many who have served in them with great distinction by trying to claim otherwise. Collusion should never, ever happen. 'On behalf of the Government and the whole country, let me say again to the Finucane family I am deeply sorry.' The review found no evidence that any . Government was informed in advance of Mr Finucane’s murder or knew about . the subsequent cover-up. Sir . Menzies Campbell, former Lib Dem leader, said he had never heard a . statement in the Commons which filled him with more 'revulsion'. However, . today Mr Finucane's son John said he could not believe that there had . been a public inquiry into newspapers hacking mobile phone messages but . not into state involvement in the death of a British lawyer. ‘We're talking about the murder of a lawyer in the UK,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘I rather flippantly announced last . year that I thought it would have been easier if my father's phone had . been hacked rather than being killed. That's not in any way to . disrespect the victims of phone hacking. ‘But . if we can have an inquiry into something as important as that, this . case is the murder of a lawyer which the British government have . admitted there was collusion, you don't then deal with that, such a . fundamental attack on democracy, by holding a non-statutory review . behind closed doors.’ David Cameron told the Commons the report revealed 'shocking' levels of state collusion . Mr Cameron has apologised more than once for the collusion between police and the loyalists responsible for the murder. But . Mr Finucane added today: ‘An apology is not in the correct running . order. You don't apologise for something but then not fully admit what . it is you're apologising for. I think that's what the Prime Minister has . done.’ The Finucane are unhappy that in 2001 the British government agreed during peace talks to meet honour for public inquiries into deaths. Of five recommended, four were held but in Mr Finucane's case it was rejected. Mr Funucane said: 'The only case that's outstanding is the case of my father. This review, we feel, is the embodiment of a broken promise of the British Government. We do feel that if they are sincere in dealing with this issue then they need to grasp this issue and they need to deal with it in a credible fashion.' The loyalist paramilitaries shot Mr Finucane 14 times as he sat eating a Sunday meal at home, wounding his wife in the process. The couple's three children witnessed the attack. The former head of the Metropolitan Police in London, Sir John Stevens, has previously investigated collusion claims surrounding Mr Finucane's death. Shortly after starting the new inquiry, the Stevens team charged former Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch agent and loyalist quartermaster William Stobie in connection with the killing. Sir Desmond de Silva QC has completed his 500-page report into the 1989 killing, which is published today . Former Met Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens published the results of his four-year inquiry into Pat Finucane's murder in 2003. The report confirmed that rogue elements in the security forces were involved in a deadly plot with loyalist paramilitaries to carry out a series of sectarian murders in Northern Ireland . But in November 2001 the case collapsed and he was shot dead outside his home within weeks. In September 2004 a loyalist accused of murdering the solicitor pleaded guilty to murdering him. Ken Barrett entered his plea at the beginning of his trial. Prime Minister David Cameron, who ordered the de Silva review, will deliver a statement to the Commons . In 2004, retired Canadian judge Mr Justice Peter Cory, asked by the Government to investigate cases of suspected collusion, concluded that military and police intelligence knew of the Finucane murder plot and failed to intervene. He recommended a public inquiry. That year, Barrett was sentenced to 22 years' imprisonment. In 2004, then Northern Ireland Secretary Paul Murphy announced an inquiry under new legislation introduced in 2005. The Finucane family opposed the Inquiries Act 2005, arguing it would allow government to interfere with the independence of a future inquiry because a government minister could rule whether the inquiry sat in public or private. As a result, plans to establish an inquiry were halted by former Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain. In October 2011, the Government ruled out a public inquiry into Mr Finucane's murder but put forward a proposal for a leading QC to review the case. That review is to be published today.","38-year-old was shot dead in front of his wife and children at home in 1989 .

"Wondering if that glass of wine has pushed you over the driving limit? Now a tiny breathalyser that plugs into a mobile phone has been developed, allowing people to test the alcohol content of their blood before getting into the car. The DrinkMate plugs into Android smartphones and displays a person's Blood Alcohol Content. Scroll down for video . DrinkMate is a breathalyser that is powered by a smartphone. Its developers claim it is the 'smallest breathalyser in the world' and claim it is accurate to 0.001 per cent Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) DrinkMate works by being plugged into an Android phone, following the app’s instructions to blow into it, and then BAC results will be displayed within a fraction of a second. BAC gives the percentage of alcohol in the blood in order to measure alcohol intoxication - for example, the UK drink drive limit is 0.08 per cent BAC. In the U.S., the limit is also 0.08 per cent. However in people with a BAC of 0.05 per cent or above, some states may apply a lesser charge - sometimes referred to as 'driving while ability impaired'. In Australia, the legal limit is 0.05 per cent. DrinkMate's U.S. developers claim it is the smallest breathalyser available on the market and is accurate to approximately 0.001 per cent BAC. The maximum alcohol reading the device can measure is 0.20 per cent BAC - a level where there is the possibility of falling unconscious. The company claims the accuracy was validated using testing and calibration kits from Lifeloc Technologies, a manufacturer of professional breath testers. However it has not been tested by independent authorities. The device works by being plugged into an Android phone. Users then follow the app’s instructions to blow into it. The results are then displayed 'within a fraction of a second'. However the developers recommended users wait between 15 and 20 minutes after their last drink before testing their blood alcohol reading. Smoking or eating during this time could also affect the reading. The device - which measures 1.7 inches in length and 0.62 inches in diameter - is so small because it has no internal battery. Instead, power is supplied from the Android phone via the micro-USB port. The developers - Shaun Masavage, an electromechanical engineer, and Mack Redding, an engineer, physicist and app develope - claim the energy used to power the breathalyser is negligible for short periods of time on any phone. They are using Kickstarter so that they can take a large quantity of orders at once, lowering manufacturing costs. An iPhone version is not currently available, but may be developed depending on the success of the Android version. For more information, visit the Kickstarter page.

"It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a... whale? The aircraft widely considered the world's strangest-looking plane celebrates 20 years in the sky this week. The Airbus A300-600ST  earned its nickname for the plane's uncanny resemblance to the white Beluga whale, with its distinctive hump on its head. The Beluga, a transport aircraft, made its maiden flight on September 13, 1994. Anniversary: The Airbus Beluga this week celebrated 20 years in the sky . Originally named the Super Transporter, the plane's monicker became so popular that it stuck, and was adopted for official use by Airbus shortly afterwards. The odd-looking aircraft has been specially modified to transport large plane parts such as wings between Airbus' European production factories. Since the 1994 original, four more Belugas have been produced, and all remain in use, making approximately 60 flights per week. Look familiar? The odd-looking aircraft earned its nickname for its uncanny resemblance to the Beluga whale with its distinctive hump on its head .

"Scotland's rich history, stunning landscapes and events such as golf's Ryder Cup are luring over two million holidaymakers a year, but what will happen to the country's lucrative tourism industry if it splits from the UK? With rising anticipation over the Scottish referendum on Thursday, a number of industry analysts and tourism chiefs are trying to predict what a Yes vote could mean for visitors and for Scots who travel abroad. Experts' biggest concerns relate to the potential impact on border controls, visa requirements and currency exchange rates if Scotland decides to go it alone. Scroll down for video . Crucial vote: An independent Scotland could spell big changes for holidaymakers . Tourism is a massively important industry in Scotland, where it employs an estimated 200,000 people and attracted over 2.5 million overseas visitors last year. Visit Scotland, the country's official tourism board, said the industry is worth £11bn and showing faster growth than the country's manufacturing, retail and transport industries. But observers are offering conflicting views over  whether that growth will accelerate or slow down in an independent Scotland. Border controls . Crossing the border is not expected to be a hassle if Scotland votes to separate. Because the UK is part of an agreed Common Travel Area, Scotland is likely to remain part of it. That means travel between the UK and Scotland would have minimal border control and people travelling to and from Scotland may not necessarily need their passport, according to insurance provider Columbus Direct. Money on the mind: Scotland's tourism industry will suffer if it cannot continue using Sterling, says one analyst . A recent survey by LJ research suggests most visitors do not care if Scotland is independent or not. Of more than 700 international and local visitors to the UK in August, 84 per cent said their decision to visit Scotland would be unaffected by the referendum results. But English respondents were twice as likely as international visitors to feel less inclined to visit. Sean Morgan, managing director of LJ Research, said: 'It is likely that Scotland's tourism industry will suffer if it cannot continue using Sterling, as this factor will likely act as a barrier among inbound visitors' decision.' Scottish holidaymakers may face a reduction in availability of insurance, says Columbus Direct . Travel blogger Kath Cross, who writes for the UK Caravan Holidays website, isn't convinced that crossing the border will be a smooth experience in an independent Scotland. Kath wrote: 'Border controls on the border with Scotland could make a UK holiday as stressful as heading abroad. 'What exactly an independent Scotland might mean for holidaymakers is yet to be seen and of course it does all depend on a Yes vote, but it could mean the need to change money to a Scottish currency in the same way you need to when you go abroad. 'It could mean passport control for those entering and leaving the country, and in time should the Scottish economy not be able to support its NHS that you may even need travel insurance to cover injury while you're away.' What will happen? There are concerns about border controls, visa requirements and currency exchange rates . Joe Goldblatt, an expert in event tourism in Edinburgh, believes tourism to Scotland will boom if independence wins the vote. He told travel news and data agency Skift: 'In the short term, tourism will dramatically increase in Scotland following independence due to the enthusiasm and interest in Scottish ancestry and culture. 'In the long term, tourism will grow even stronger due to easier and better visa regulations being put in place that will welcome more tourists to Scotland and encourage them to extend their stay to explore different parts of its beautiful land.' The Scottish National Party claims independence will lead to lower tourism taxes, meaning cheaper holidays, more visitors and a boost for the Scottish economy. But those in the No campaign say independence would hamper tourist flows and Scotland would lose its profile of being a member of the UK. A recent survey by LJ research suggests most visitors to the UK do not care if Scotland is independent or not . Travel insurance . Scottish holidaymakers may face a reduction in availability when choosing insurance because many UK-based insurers are only able to insure UK residents, meaning Scots may either not be eligible for cover or will be directed to a specialist provider for their insurance. There has been speculation that Scottish independence may result in a change of currency to the Euro, meaning that British insurers with license to sell insurance in Scotland may only be able to accept payments and offer settlements in Sterling. However, Scottish independence may lead to a rise in the number of Scottish-based insurers. Greg Lawson of Columbus Direct said: 'If the polls are to be believed, the results on Thursday will be extremely close and a vote for independence could have a direct impact on travellers on both sides of the border. 'In the short-term, a Yes vote will disrupt the insurance markets, with both choice and price affected, but my view is that it will inevitably stabilise over time. 'The insurance industry is a mature market and adept to change and therefore will evolve to meet the needs of residents, whatever the outcome.' Big business: Scotland's tourism industry attracted over 2.5 million overseas visitors last year . Health . While Scotland is likely to keep its National Health Service, it will operate as a separate and independent Scottish NHS, meaning unless a reciprocal agreement is made between the UK and Scotland, anyone travelling between the two countries may have to pay for any medical care they receive. If this does change, travel insurers are likely to charge higher premiums. The premiums would be similar to those that they charge for European travel, with some providers potentially charging their customers double for cover. Crossing the border may not be that much of a hassle if Scotland votes to separate . National airline and air travel . And then there is the question of whether an independent Scotland should create a national airline. Faced with the possibility of a new competitor, several aviation bosses told the Independent that Scotland shouldn't bother. Christoph Mueller, chief executive of Aer Lingus, said: 'Don't do it.' Professor Keith Shaw from Northumbria University, who has written an analysis on what he believes could happen if Scotland separates, said: 'There is also a good deal of anxiety about the implications, for Newcastle Airport in particular, of an independent Scottish government committing itself to an immediate 50 per cent reduction in Air Passenger Duty. 'There are also fears that cross-border businesses would suffer from any variation in exchange rates and from the potential administrative costs of dealing with two different currencies.'","Scotland's lucrative tourism industry employs around 200,000 people .

One in ten (10 per cent) are fans of trying it on with multiple pals by having kissed more than two of their friends. Two in five (40 per cent) of 25-34 year olds having previously dated a friend . The survey suggests many Britons are turning to dating their friends in their search for love, with one third admitting they have had romantic feelings for a friend. Two in five (40 per cent) of 25-34 year olds having previously dated a friend, while almost one quarter (24 per cent) of all Britons say they have had a sexual encounter with one of their mates. Just like Monica and Chandler, whose relationship developed from a night together, almost a fifth (19 per cent) of Britons have kissed a friend on or after a drunken night out. However, the research showed that dating within your friendship group can have its drawbacks. Almost one in five (17 per cent) of 18-24 year olds, and ten per cent of 25-34 year olds revealed that their relationship with a friend did not end well, whilst 13 per cent of 18-34 year olds said that they regretted getting involved. More than one in ten (13 per cent) of 18-34 year olds said they would like to meet someone outside their friendship group. Almost one in five 18-24 year olds say that their relationship with a friend did not end well . But almost one fifth (19 per cent) admitted they find it hard to meet people when they are out, as they just talk to their friends. Many of us are familiar with the love triangle of Rachel, Joey and Ross, but one in ten of 18-24 year olds have also been involved in a love triangle within their friendship group. Echoing another of Friends famous storylines, eight per cent of 25-34 year olds admitted that they have dated a friend's brother or sister. The research also showed that men are more likely to get involved with their friends than women; 38 per cent revealed they have developed romantic feelings for a friend, compared to just 29 per cent of women. As iconic TV series Friends turns 20, dating website match.com reveals just how common dating your friends is in real life through their latest report. Kate Taylor, relationship expert for match.com, reveals the pitfalls of friendcest: . 'Friendcest is an easy trap to fall into. If you socialise in a close circle of friends, your opportunities to meet new people can be limited. 'This may also scare off potential daters, who could be wary to approach you if you're always in a large group, and your social life might keep you so busy that you don't make time to look for love. 'Dating a friend might feel like the perfect solution, but there are dangers. You might have friends in common, but not necessarily share the same interests, goals or ambitions. 'You might stay in an unhappy ""Friendcestuous"" relationship longer than you should, because you're scared of splitting up your social circle or losing some of your mutual friends. 'You might mistake friendship for love, and be disappointed if the relationship never delivers on passion, romance or excitement. 'I'd advise other ways to find the perfect match for them, rather than just looking around to see who's nearby. Sometimes, like for Ross and Rachel, it can work out. But other times, like for Rachel and Joey, it's doomed .","One in ten Britons have kissed more than two of their friends .

"Beth Cleasby, 26, from Oxford had at least 50 one night stands because she was drunk . Every mother hopes for, yet in equal measure dreads, the day her eldest child leaves home to start university. As Kym-Marie Cleasby hugged 20-year-old Bethany goodbye on the doorstep of her new student digs in Southampton, she desperately tried to mask her tears with a smile. These exciting new beginnings would mark the next chapter in her daughter’s life — it was her duty as a mother to let go. Back home, in their empty nest in Witney, near Oxford, she and her husband Rodney, 61, a graphic designer, were consoled by the fact that Bethany’s photography course would launch her into a rewarding career. But what Kym-Marie, 51, a director of an international charity, could not have anticipated was that Bethany’s arrival at university would precipitate her downward spiral into a dangerous world of alcohol dependency, leaving her deep in debt and vulnerable to sexual predators. While stories of students drinking to excess are nothing new, Bethany’s tale will horrify any mother of daughters. And never more so than at this time of year, as drink-fuelled Freshers’ Weeks across Britain seduce a new cohort of wide-eyed students with a seemingly endless supply of cheap alcohol. before her first term at Southampton Solent University was out, Bethany had developed the beginnings of such a serious drink problem that she swapped lectures for sessions at Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), before dropping out of university altogether. ‘It sickens me to admit that I must have had at least 50 one-night stands — and they’re the ones that I am aware of — all because I was too drunk to care,’ she says. Too drunk to bother with contraception, Bethany realises she was very lucky not to get pregnant, or contract a sexually transmitted infection. And, having repeatedly put herself in vulnerable positions, she is also aware she’s lucky to be alive. Now 26, Bethany says her problems began when, as a shy student, she took advantage of the cheap booze laid on to lubricate those awkward early social interactions. When, two months into her university career, Bethany called home in tears, her parents were horrified. ‘She had six weeks of term to go, but had already blown her entire student maintenance loan — around £1,600 — and was a further £1,000 overdrawn,’ Kym-Marie says. ‘it emerged that all of it had gone on drink.’ At her parents’ insistence, Bethany caught a train home within the hour. later that evening, the full extent of her drinking became clear. ‘We worked out she was drinking around 240 units a week,’ says Kym-Marie. ‘more than 15 times the recommended limit.’ Bethany's mother Kym-Marie, 51, had to step in to help her daughter who found there was no support at university . When she went back to university after Christmas 2008, her parents took control of her finances, opening a bank account in Kym-Marie’s name and transferring £30 a week for food. But, unbeknown to them, Bethany spent the money on alcohol. She was also so adept at getting others to buy drinks for her that controlling her money made little difference. ‘Some clubs sold pints for 50p, and my friends and I could easily share a litre of vodka before going out,’ she says. ‘I regularly had blackouts, where I could barely remember arriving at a club let alone leaving it. Persia's alcohol habit had got so bad that she would regularly black out on a night out with friends . ‘Once, apparently, I even went around a late-night kebab shop asking men to go home with me. Fortunately, one guy, a total stranger, realised the state I was in and took me to my shared house.’ For Kym-Marie, it was a terrifying time. Though Bethany kept many of the most shameful incidents to herself, she would often phone home, full of self-loathing and distraught about her drinking. With her parents’ encouragement, she began attending AA meetings, but felt out of place in the group of mainly men, meeting secretly in dark church halls. She longed to find others in a similar situation to herself: young women, new to alcohol and struggling to cope. Emily Robinson, director of campaigns at Alcohol Concern, says: ‘It’s not easy for young people to work out how to deal with alcohol. They’re bombarded with alcohol advertising, which tells them drinking is a normal thing to do, and it’s often available at unscrupulously low prices. One in six children report being given alcohol by their parents aged just 12 or 13 . ‘Young people also tend to overestimate how much their peers drink, which can cause a feeling that “everyone is doing it”.’ Indeed, research conducted by Drinkaware and the National Union of Students claims many 18 to 24-year-olds think it is socially unacceptable not to drink alcohol, and one in five young adults say peer pressure influences them to drink more than they might wish. Further evidence suggests that those who drink heavily in their teens and early 20s are up to twice as likely as light drinkers to still be binge-drinking 25 years later. Persia Lawson, 28, is certain it was her arrival at Exeter University ten years ago, to study English literature, that sparked her lack of boundaries around alcohol. ‘Nothing prepared me for the student alcohol culture,’ she says. ‘Aged 18, I’d barely drunk before and, suddenly, was seeing boozed-up girls getting naked in pubs and boys urinating into shoes in the middle of the afternoon. The student regularly drank 30 units a night in an effort to be the life and soul of the party . ‘Everyone was drinking. If you didn’t join in, you got left behind. I wasn’t drinking to escape problems — I didn’t have any — it was just about trying to fit in.’ Keen to be the ‘life and soul’, Persia was soon drinking up to 10 units a night, four days a week. ‘As my tolerance grew, I would down a bottle of wine before going out. There were ambulances outside clubs before anyone arrived: they knew the state we’d get into.’ After three years at university, Persia’s drinking was getting progressively worse. ‘I used to black out a lot, and ended up stranded at parties in the middle of nowhere, with no money to get home. I’d wake up from one-night stands, not knowing where I was or who with. In two months, I put on 2 st because of the alcohol.’ Somehow, Persia’s grades didn’t slip. After graduating, she enrolled on a drama course. ‘By then, I was so used to drinking, I thought it was normal to turn up to 8am classes still drunk. It was almost a badge of honour.’ But, when she began experiencing stomach cramps, panic attacks and depression a year after graduating, she knew that she needed help. Persia says her tolerance of alcohol increased . ‘I joined a 12-step addiction recovery programme and went to therapy and started looking at the reasons I was drinking so much in the first place - because I didn't value and respect myself. 'I started to drink less, do exercise and eat more healthily, which meant that I no longer needed to turn to booze to escape from my problems and lack of self-worth.' Now, Persia jointly runs a support group for young women called Addictive Daughter. It's aimed at young women who struggle with addictive behaviours, inspiring them to make healthier lifestyle choices. She has now learned to ‘drink like a grown-up, not a student', and is much happier as a result. Last year, concerned headteachers wrote to universities to warn them they are failing in their duty of care to students by ignoring the binge-drinking culture amongst young people studying away from home for the first time. Emily Robinson says the blame cannot be laid solely with universities: ‘If we’re to change the student drinking culture, we need bars and retailers to act responsibly, and this means not trying to hook them in with irresponsible price promotions. ‘We need the Government to act and introduce a minimum unit price, which would cover student bars and help prevent students bulk-buying cheap alcohol to “pre-load” at home before going out.’ Kym-Marie believes the combination of cheap alcohol and student loans can prove lethal, when combined with a first taste of independence. Although she didn’t finish her course, with family support, Bethany stopped drinking, of her own volition, in June 2011. Horrified by the lack of age-appropriate support, Kym-Marie has now left her job to set up a charity with Bethany to plug that gap. Wash My Pink Jumper (a code phrase Bethany would use on the phone to her mum while at university to show she needed help, without losing face in front of her friends) offers a helpline and weekly meetings for young women. ‘Drinking is not always black and white. It is not always about being an alcoholic or not,’ Kym-Marie says. ‘We support young women, and parents who are worried about them. I don’t want any mother to feel how I felt.’ For Bethany, the charity has been a lifeline: ‘To know I got through that awful time and can help others do the same gives me purpose. I feel horrified at what I did, what I put everyone through. ‘I was lucky to have such a strong, supportive family — in many ways, the charity aims to replicate that for other girls who are not so fortunate.’ Visit washmypinkjumper.com, addictivedaughter.com, or actiononaddiction.org.uk .

"Last week the World's 50 Best Restaurant Awards – one of the culinary world's most prestigious honours – were announced. The list held few surprises, with the top ten restaurants largely unchanged from last year, and once more the list featured strikingly few women. Of the top 50 restaurants in the world, only three had a female head chef or owner and no restaurant on the list had a solo female head chef, with each of the female chefs working with a male partner – their husband, boyfriend, or father. Elena Arzak is the head chef at Arzak in San Sebastian, which was the highest-ranked restaurant in the world run by a woman . The highest-ranked restaurant run by a woman is Arzak, in San Sebastian Spain, which was named eighth best in the world, and is jointly managed by Elena Arzak, 44, and her father Juan Mari. Ms Arzak said that her success comes from growing up in a society where women were encouraged to reach the highest professional echelons. 'We are a matriarchal society where the woman has always been very strong. So I grew up in a society… where being a woman chef is normal,' said Ms Arzak. 'For example my grandmother was a chef, my great-grandmother as well... in Arzak, 80 percent of the staff are women,' she said. Ms Arzak acknowledges that these figures are unusual and says that when she worked at restaurants in Switzerland, France, and Britain, she was often the only woman working in the kitchen. According to a study of U.S. restaurants by Bloomberg, women make up only six percent of head chef positions at restaurants. When that figure is expanded to include chefs as well as head cooks, the figure increased to only 19 percent, less than female CEOs, of which there are 24 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Elena Arzak, 44, runs the restaurant with her father, 72-year-old Juan Mari Arzak. She began working in the Arzak kitchen at the age of 11 . The dishes that made her famous: Some of Arzak's creations: Green Monkfish Sorceress (left) and The Big Truffle (right) It was this lack of female chefs in professional kitchens that led to the creation of a new award in 2011, which is voted on by the same 900 panellists who choose the top 50 restaurants – the Veuve Clicquot World's Best Female Chef Award. 'Professional kitchens very much remain a male-dominated world and we think that balance should be rectified where possible,' said William Drew, Group Editor of the awards. 'One of the ways of doing that is by celebrating those female chefs who have been and are successful with a view to inspiring the next generation of young women to follow them into that profession.' The award has come under fire for being unnecessary and patronising to women, criticism that Mr Drew is well aware of. 'In theory, one shouldn't need an award that separates out female chefs from male chefs, if we lived in a world of equality that wouldn't be necessary… but as it is, the vast majority of chefs are men. That will hopefully not be the case generations down the line, but while that is the case, we're taking some positive action to go a small way to rectifying that.' The winner of the award this year was 35-year-old Helena Rizzo, who runs Mani in Sao Paulo, Brazil, which was ranked 36th in the world, with husband Daniel Redondo. Helena Rizzo runs Mani in Sao Paulo with her husband Daniel Redondo and was awarded World's Best Female Chef at this year's awards . 'Working in the kitchen is as hard for men as it is for women. The long hours, the heat of the kitchen, the cuts, the burns, the weekend shifts. To be in this profession you have to give up many other things,' she said. However, Ms Rizzo does think the Veuve Clicquot Best Female Chef Award is a helpful step in rectifying the gender disparity in the industry. 'I hope [it] makes the gastronomic world open its eyes to the work of more female chefs,' she said. Ms Rizzo, who was a model and an architect before taking up professional cooking, met her husband while they were both working at El Celler de Can Roca in Spain. The pair have run Mani together since 2006. Having a supportive partner seems to be crucial to the success of female chefs. Elena Arzak, who won the Veuve Clicquote prize in 2012, is married to Manu Lamosa, an architect, with whom she has two children – Nora, nine, and Matteo, seven. She says her husband is very involved with raising the children, who see more of their father than they do of her. 'As long as they see you are happy, they are happy… I think it's very important to be positive and set an example,' said Ms Arzak. 'I don't want to say it's easy. It's not easy; nothing is easy in life if you want to work hard.' But she is hopeful that 'little by little' things will change and awards like the Best Female Chef Award will no longer be necessary as the culinary world stops taking such notice of gender. 'As a woman I am quite feminine; but when I cook no one notices,' said Ms Arzak.

"Everton's worst fears about Kevin Mirallas have been realised as the Belgium forward faces up to eight weeks on the sidelines. Mirallas pulled up sharply during Everton’s 1-1 draw with Liverpool on Saturday and left the field on a stretcher; manager Roberto Martinez immediately said after the game that the signs 'did not look good'. He was sent for scans on Sunday and subsequently had more tests on Tuesday to determine the full extent of the damage. It is understood that Mirallas is now not expected to return before December. Kevin Mirallas looked in some pain after picking up a hamstring injury at Anfield on Saturday . The Everton forward had to be carried off on a stretcher during his side's Merseyside clash against Liverpool . A lay-off of that length would equate to him having suffered a grade two tear of his hamstring. It is a huge blow for Martinez and Everton, as Mirallas has been in excellent form since the start of the season and had scored three goals in seven appearances. The 26-year-old will now be denied the opportunity to play against his former club Lille in the Europa League at the end of this month, as well missing up to six Barclays Premier League fixtures, starting with this Sunday’s trip to Manchester United. When Mirallas first joined Everton in 2012, he suffered a number of hamstring problems but last season he turned things around and was virtually ever present before going on to help Belgium reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup. News of Mirallas' injury will come as a major blow to Roberto Martinez's first team plans . Martinez has praised the work Mirallas has done to improve his fitness and the former Olympiakos striker admitted recently that he was in his best physical condition, now that he had fully adjusted to the demands of English football. Mirallas said: ‘When I came here from Greece at first I struggled because the leagues are totally different. Here it is all about possession, about running up and down, it’s non-stop all the time. I was getting very tired when I first arrived but now I feel totally different about things – I feel very good. ‘It’s my third season here and each one it has got better. The players have improved, we’ve improved as a team every year.’","The Belgium ace is likely to be out of action until December .

"A Warwickshire pensioner has been left scarred for life following a botched facelift. Pearl Richman was awarded more than £43,000 in compensation after her life was 'almost ruined' by a procedure carried out in 2010. After the operation, the 69-year-old developed necrosis - a form of cell injury which results in the premature death of skin cells - and was left with open flesh wounds. Pearl Richman developed necrosis after her facelift performed by an Italian surgeon in 2010 . But despite a court finding in favour of Mrs Richman and awarding compensation, she says she still hasn't received a penny and the surgeon, from Italy, is still believed to be operating in the UK. Mrs Richman, from Kenilworth, Warwickshire, took her civil case to a county court hearing in April, where a judge awarded costs against the surgeon for negligence. Now she is calling for the government to take action over 'seagull surgeons' - foreign doctors who fly into the UK and undertake procedures before returning home. Should problems arise following surgery, it is often difficult and expensive to pursue restitution for patients. 'This might sound dramatic to people, but this has almost ruined my life,' said Mrs Richman. 'I always took pride in my appearance and over the years I went from having lots of photos of myself around the house, to having none. 'I had talked about having a facelift but they are expensive and we didn't have the money. My kids had always talked about buying one for me and one year my daughter Jo, who has her own business, was able to do just that.' Despite being awarded £43,000 in compensation Pearl has yet to received any of the money . The company which organised the £8,000 facelift has now gone into administration. The centre introduced Mrs Richman to an Italian surgeon before she underwent the procedure at a hospital in London. Necrosis is literally the body's cells dying prematurely. This tissue death can occur anywhere on the body and is usually caused by an external factor such as injury, infection, or chemicals. If a substantial area of tissue dies completely the condition is know as gangrene. Treatment involves the removal of the dead tissue, keeping the area clean, and antibiotics and hyperbaric oxygen therapy where suitable. She added: 'He never talked about necrosis at all. It wasn't mentioned. He talked about the normal risks but at no point at all did he mention necrosis. I just remember him saying that he would make me happy. 'When they took the drains out of my face it hurt so much, I screamed and it started to go purple. It went from a large purple bruise to a huge black scab that had the feel and look of leather.' The company contacted the surgeon in Italy and he arranged an emergency appointment with Mrs Richman. She said: 'When he saw me he took me straight into a treatment room and said it had to be treated like first degree burns. He told me he was so sorry and that it did not happen very often. 'He offered laser treatment which I had and he said he would do everything he could to make it better and put it right. That is the last we have ever heard from him.' Clinical negligence lawyer Jeanette Whyman, of law firm Wright Hassall, is now pursuing the case. She said: 'I am aware of 'seagull surgeons' but have not come across the issue to such a horrific degree. He does have insurers but because he has not notified them of the incident, they will not cover him. Pearl, pictured here with Wright Hassall clinical negligence lawyer Jeanette Whyman (left) wants to warn others about 'seagull surgeons' 'His residency outside of the UK shouldn't, in theory, make a difference. What it means is we can get a judgement here but it has to be enforced abroad which can be expensive. If there are no assets in the UK, you cannot enforce here and it has to be pursued abroad.' Mrs Richman is now urging anyone contemplating surgery to undertake extensive checks. She added: 'Surgeons should not be limited to their country but the government should make sure there is a level of accountability through qualifications and insurances. 'Clinics should also be responsible for the actions of the surgeons they use. 'I would not want (this) to happen to another single person.'","Pearl  developed necrosis after facelift performed by an Italian surgeon .

"Passport Office staff received bonuses totalling nearly £700,000 this summer at the height of the backlog shambles. Taxpayer-funded payouts worth up to £5,000 were paid out to staff as the agency was mired in crisis and hundreds of thousands of holiday-makers waited for their travel documents. Details of the payouts sparked fury last night as critics accused the Government of 'rewarding failure'. Official figures released to Labour under the Freedom of Information Act showed some £674,000 was paid out in bonuses in July. A photo leaked by staff showed the boxes of passport applications which piled up in an office in Liverpool this summer as the backlog of documents grew . But despite the shambles, figures now reveal staff at the Passport Office have been paid £700,000 in bonuses . Some 3,800 members of staff including some managers received payouts for the last financial year. One staff member was paid £5,000, eight up to £2,000 and 198 up to £1,000. Only weeks earlier, in June, David Cameron apologised over the passports chaos which at one point involved a backlog of half a million documents. Outraged families deluged the Daily Mail with horror stories of missing out on their holidays because of bureaucratic incompetence. A surge in applications early this year increased during the Spring and Summer and led to staggering backlogs. Shadow immigration minister David Hanson says hundreds of thousands of pounds in taxpayers' money has been handed over as a 'reward for failure' Staff leaked photographs of boxes of applications stacked up in passport offices waiting to be processed.Some applicants were told to cough up an extra £55 to get their applications fast tracked. David Hanson, the shadow immigration minister, said: 'Ministers must explain themselves. They have signed off hundreds of thousands of taxpayer pounds to reward failure. 'Families who struggled to go on holiday because of passport chaos will be even more dismayed at this waste and extravagance as they struggle to pay day-to-day bills. 'This is yet another example of ministerial incompetence and waste.' At the time, the Home Office claimed it was dealing with record numbers of passport applications, but unions blamed staff cuts and incompetence. Paul Pugh, director of the Passport Office, told MPs on the Home Affairs Committee in June that he would not take a bonus this year. A Home Office spokesman said staff were rewarded because the Passport Office achieved seven out of its eight performance targets. He said: 'A bonus payment was made to some junior staff at HM Passport Office for reaching key targets in 2013/14 – the vast majority received less than £500. 'None of these payments was for work carried out during this financial year,' he said.","Thousands of holiday-makers forced to wait for documents this summer .

"A mother who underwent a hysterectomy was horrified after her stitches burst open within an hour of returning home - leaving her with a gaping nine-inch wound. Clair Bartlett, 34, faced hours of agony waiting nearly two hours for an ambulance to arrive, and a further four to be seen in A&E. The disabled mother-of-four was left in agonising pain, holding her open wound. In desperation her husband, Jason, was forced to tape her bleeding and oozing injury together. Clair Bartlett, pictured with her husband Jason, was left in agony after her hysterectomy scar burst open hours after her stitches had been removed . The 34-year-old was forced to wait an hour-and-a-half for an ambulance to reach her Basingstoke home on July 26, and her family claim they waited a further four hours to see a doctor after arriving at hospital. Mr Bartlett said he resorted to using medical tape to try and close his wife's wound as they waited for help . He told MailOnline: 'Clair had just got back from hospital and was in the bathroom. 'Our eldest daughter Shannon, 13, came into talk to her and said ""mum, do you know your wound is bleeding?"" 'Clair called me in and as she did, it literally burst open like a zipper. 'Shannon freaked out and that made all the other children run in the bathroom - they have all seen it and are traumatised now.' Mr Bartlett dialled 999 just before 5.30pm on Saturday, July 26, and was told by the operator to clamp his wife's stomach together until help arrived. 'Clair was literally sitting there, holding the wound together with her bare hands,' he said. 'We were later told there must have been an infection in the wound which is why it hadn't healed.' The 41-year-old taped the wound but the ambulance did not arrive at the couple's Basingstoke home until 7.06pm - an hour-and-a-half later. During that time, the family rang 999 for an hour and were reassured that despite it was a busy Saturday evening, help was on its way. 'I was asked ""can you see the intestines?"" I said ""I don't know - I'm not a doctor, all I can see is lots of red tissue"",' he told MailOnline. 'I was told, rest assured, help was on its way.' Mr Bartlett said: 'Clair was literally sitting there, holding the wound together with her bare hands... I wanted to drive Clair to hospital myself, but she was worried about being moved with the wound split open.' Mr Bartlett claims he was told their call was classified as non-urgent by ambulance operators . Mr Bartlett was also told to take his wife to lie down, because she had started to feel sick and dizzy due to the searing pain in her abdomen. Mrs Bartlett underwent the hysterectomy on July 16. 'The surgeons seemed happy afterwards,' said her husband. But the couple were . unhappy that Mrs Bartlett - who takes 51 different pills every day for . her various conditions - was not allowed to self administer them in . hospital. She discharged herself on the Friday, a day earlier than advised by doctors, and returned to have the stitches out on the Saturday. An hour after getting home, her stomach burst open. Her husband recalled: 'We got . home about 4pm and an hour later, Clair went to the loo before she went . to bed. It was then that everything happened. In . statement, South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust (SCAS), . told MailOnline: 'I can confirm that we were called at 17:30 on 26 July . to an address in Basingstoke to a 999 call. 'We are now reviewing the call and are therefore not able to comment further until thereview has been completed. 'We are already in contact with the patient and their family and it is regrettable that on thisoccasion we didn’t arrive at the patients side until 19:06. 'We take our response to our patients very seriously and we would like to take theopportunity to wish the patient a speedy recovery.' A . spokeswoman for Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: 'All . issues and concerns raised by patients, families and visitors very . seriously and all complaints are seen and responded to by our Chief . Executive. 'We . have met with Ms Bartlett and/or her partner on a number of occasions . to listen to their concerns and explain the care and treatment given. 'We have also apologised for the communication problems they experienced.' 'In the end, I ended up trying to . hold the wound together with medical tape -the white stretchy stuff you . might put over a plaster.' After three calls to the ambulance service, Mr Bartlett said he was becoming infuritated. 'I wanted to drive Clair to . hospital myself, but she and my father-in-law were worried about moving . her with the wound split open,' he said. 'They basically convinced me . otherwise,' he told MailOnline. 'When the ambulance driver turned up, he seemed bemused that I was so angry. He said he only got the call 13 minutes before.' Mr Bartlett claims the call had . been marked as non-urgent by the Ambulance Service. 'How can a call be . non-urgent when they asked me if I could see my wife's intestines?,' he . said. 'There were no sirens, nothing, when they turned up. One . of the paramedics said they were ""disgusted"" at the fact they had only . just got the call. What if she had deteriorated? We could have lost . her.' He added: 'Looking back, they . did have to dig really hard to get the stitches out - and yanked them . out - I'm not sure if that contributed.' He said that because Mrs Bartlett, who relies on a wheelchair and crutches, is . physically disabled, the surgeons agreed to remove all the stitches in . one go rather than two stages, as they do normally. 'We trusted the doctors and throught it would save to-ing and fro-ing,' Mr Bartlett said. He said the stitches that burst, were the external ones, not the internal ones holding her stomach together. When Mrs Bartlett was admitted to Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital the family said it was was another four hours before they were seen by a doctor. The wound was bandaged with a special plaster and doctors prescribed antibiotics, but told the family the wound could not be sewn up because Mrs Bartlett was suffering an infection. Three weeks on from her ordeal, and Mrs Bartlett, who is disabled due to fibromyalgia, a condition which causes pain all over the body, restless leg syndrome and Raynaud's disease, is finally healing. But Mr Bartlett is furious at the 'unnecesary pain and trauma' his wife has been through. 'We don't blame the hospital - we just don't understand why the ambulance took so long and then why it took so long for Clair to be seen in hospital,' he said. The couple are now considering legal action.","Mother-of-four Clair Bartlett had a hysterectomy on July 16 .

"The terrier was discovered in the garden of Paul Wollam who later admitted three counts of animal cruelty . RSPCA inspectors found a dog starved to death in a garden shed which had been jammed shut with a breeze block. The terrier was discovered in the garden of Paul Wollam, a father-of-four, who later admitted three counts of animal cruelty. The 37-year-old, of Tipton, West Midlands, told inspectors the terrier called Molly had gone missing days before the discovery on March 16. Wollam, an unemployed foundry worker, told them he had no idea how she ended up starving to death in the barricaded shed. As he was sentenced at Birmingham Magistrates Court on Friday, he was told the case was one of the worst magistrates had seen. However, Wollam avoided prison because he is the sole carer of his four children after his ex-partner walked out on the family, the court heard. Banning him from keeping animals for life, the chair of the bench told the panel: 'This is a very serious offence, one of the worst that has come before this court. 'It is only because of your early guilty plea and domestic commitments you are not going to prison.' They gave him an 18-week suspended sentence and placed him under supervision for two years. He was also ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid work and pay £300 costs. Gaynor Sutton, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said an inspector visited Wollam's address on March 16 after finding an emaciated Shih Tzu with one of his neighbours. They were told the dog had been bought from Wollam. When the inspector was let into his home by one of his children, an emaciated Bichon Frise dog was found to be around half its expected body weight. One of the dogs found at the Tipton home of Paul Wollam. The 37-year-old avoided prison after admitting three counts of animal cruelty . But the most grisly discovery was made when the breeze block was moved away from the shed door and the dead terrier was discovered. Mrs Sutton said: 'The inspector saw the Shih Tzu in the garden and the dead terrier type dog in the shed. 'There was a breeze block in front of the door. 'The defendant arrived home and was shown the dead dog. He said he thought it had gone missing and that he had seen it a few days before. 'The dog had matted hair and there was no food or water in the shed. An inspector visited Wollam's address after finding an emaciated Shih Tzu with one of his neighbours . 'The dog had been dead for some time and there were maggots in the coat. 'A post mortem found an emaciated dog with hardly any body weight and the cause of death was assessed to be starvation. There were no broken bones.' In a statement, the vet who carried out the post mortem said: 'The care of this dog was appalling, allowing a dog to die of starvation is despicable. A terrier type dog found dead in Wollam's shed which was jammed shut with a breeze block . 'Death would have been slow and prolonged. 'There is a complete lack of care and compassion. This was death in the worst way imaginable.' Ravi Dev, defending, said: 'He tells me he looked through the garden and in the streets but couldn't locate the dog. 'He did not realise it was in the shed.' Mr Dev went on to say Wollam, who had been made redundant from his foundry job, had suffered a period of depression after being left alone to care for his four children. 'He was not coping properly,' he said. 'It's no excuse for what's happened and he takes responsibility for that.'","Terrier discovered in the garden of Paul Wollam, 37, of West Midlands .

"In one of her latest presenting roles, Davina McCall helps reunite families who have been torn apart by time and difficult circumstances. It's a subject that's close to home for Davina, as her relationship with her own mother, Florence, was strained after she left her to be raised by her grandparents. Now the TV presenter has opened up about how she feels towards her estranged parent - who died in 2008. Scroll down for video . Difficult childhood: Davina has admitted all she ever wanted from her mother was a cuddle . She told the Daily Telegraph's Judith Woods: 'I never doubted for a moment that she loved me. It was almost a relief when she was gone and I could stop asking her to be something that she just couldn't be.' She added: 'Motherhood is about being selfless, to some degree, and she just needed to be the centre of attention.' The 46-year-old explained that all she ever really wanted from her mother was 'a protective cuddle', and she makes up for never getting this by giving her own children, Holly, 12, Tilly, 10, and Chester, seven, plenty of affection. Rock solid: The presenter said her marriage to Matthew Robertson remains a happy one . 'That's why it takes me so long to put my kids to bed every night; I need to hold them,' she said. Speaking of her 14-year marriage to Matthew Robertson, she said they are 'rock solid' following reports that she refused to do Strictly Come Dancing in case it put too much strain on their relationship. Setting the record straight, Davina clarified that she didn't want to do anything that would take her away from her family for too long. 'I'm very lucky to be able to achieve a work/life balance that most working mums can't, but when I get the balance wrong, it makes me melancholy, which isn't who I am,' she said. Davina helps reunite families on ITV's Long Lost Family with Nicky Campbell, right: Success stories have included helping Denise, third from left, find her daughter, Sara, second from left, after she had to give her up for adoption decades ago . As a result, she ensures her work - including the aforementioned Long Lost Family for ITV and The Million Pound Drop for Channel 4 - doesn't get in the way of the school run to and from their home in East Sussex. She did make an exception to this rule when she did her gruelling Sport Relief challenge earlier this year, which involved cycling, swimming and running 500 miles from Edinburgh to London in seven days. Despite being super fit, the challenge took its toll on Davina, and viewers were alarmed when she collapsed following her swim across freezing Lake Windermere in Cumbria. Active mother: Davina completed a gruelling Sport Relief challenge in March and is now encouraging other people to get on their bikes to get fit . But she showed her mettle as she battled on to complete the challenge - raising thousands of pounds in the process. Despite the ordeal, it hasn't put the mother-of-three off pushing herself to keep fit. But she's currently being active in a less intense way as an ambassador for Sky Ride - a campaign between Sky and British Cycling which is aiming to get more people on their bikes.","Long Lost Family presenter had difficult relationship with her late mother .

"Supporters are now calling for the daily pill to be made available on the NHS . Sexual health campaigners have urged healthcare workers to consider offering a HIV prevention pill to healthy individuals who are at substantial risk of infection. The guidelines, issued by the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Public Health Service, involve the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP, when at-risk individuals take a daily dose of the drug to reduce their risk of HIV infection. Supporters are now calling for the daily pill to be made available on the NHS. A trial is already taking place in Brighton to see whether PrEP will lead to a reduction in the use of condoms and its impact on the spread of other sexually transmitted diseases. The two-year PROUD trial involves 550 gay men and it is hoped it will convince authorities in the UK to introduce the drug on the NHS. The idea builds on a landmark 2010 study that found Gilead Sciences Inc's Truvada - a pill already widely used to treat the human immunodeficiency virus - was more than 90 per cent effective at preventing HIV infections among test subjects who took the drug as prescribed. According to the new guidelines, healthcare providers should consider PrEP for anyone who meets specific risk criteria, such as being in a relationship with an HIV-infected partner or having sex without condoms with partners known to be at risk for HIV, such as injecting drug users. The guidelines offer the first comprehensive guidance from the CDC. But critics have warned the pill could lead to complacency around condom use. Yusef Azad, director of policy at the National Aids Trust, told The Independent: 'Before we get it on the NHS, which is what I think we should have, we should make sure through the PROUD trial that we're confident about some of these unanswered questions.' In 2011, there were 6,280 new diagnoses of HIV in the UK. At the end of 2011, around 96,000 people were living with HIV. It is estimated that around a quarter of people who have HIV don't know that they have it.Of the 6,280 new cases of HIV in 2011, around 48% were infected through heterosexual sex, and 48% through sex between men. A view of HIV within the blood-stream. According to the new guidelines, healthcare providers should consider PrEP for anyone who meets specific risk criteria . HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) attacks the body’s immune system (our natural defence against infection and disease). In late-stage HIV infection, also known as AIDS, the weakened immune system means the body is more vulnerable to life-threatening conditions such as pneumonia and cancer. The virus is passed on through exchanging bodily fluids such as semen, blood, or vaginal secretions. The CDC now estimates as many as 275,000 uninfected gay men and 140,000 heterosexual couples, in which one partner is HIV-infected, could benefit from PrEP. Some 1.2 million people in the United States live with HIV, and new infections are estimated at 50,000 each year.","The guidelines involve the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP .

"A commercial aircraft carrying 224 passengers and crew was forced to make an emergency landing in Ireland after one of its engines suffered a malfunction over the Atlantic Ocean today. The emergency was declared while the KLM flight was en route to Amsterdam from Kralendijk, the capital of the Caribbean island of Bonaire. The twin-engine Airbus A330-203 was around 300 miles southwest of Shannon when the flight crew reported a problem, shut down the left engine and diverted to the Irish city’s airport. Engine trouble: A KLM plane was forced to make an emergency landing in Shannon, Ireland . With firefighters and other personnel awaiting its arrival, the plane landed safely about an hour after the emergency was declared during the transatlantic flight. There were fears that the plane’s brakes could overheat or catch fire during the emergency landing because there was just one engine to provide reverse thrust to help the aircraft to slow down, The Irish Times reported. Passengers disembarked and the plane was inspected by aircraft technicians to determine the cause of the malfunction. A KLM spokesman told MailOnline Travel the cause remains under investigation. The airline said in a statement: ‘Due to a technical problem the KL765 landed out of precaution safely at Shannon, Ireland. Passengers and crew were not in danger.’ Two smaller Boeing 737-800 planes were sent to the airport to pick up the passengers and fly them to Amsterdam. There were fears that the plane’s brakes could overheat or catch fire during the emergency landing .","Plane was en route to Amsterdam from the Caribbean island of Bonaire .

"Baroness Margaret Thatcher is believed to have begun plans for her funeral eight years ago . Even from the grave, Baroness Thatcher has managed to rule how her own funeral will be conducted. The former prime minister meticulously planned how the farewell service will run - from the singing to who gives the readings. Baroness Thatcher is believed to have begun making arrangements eight years ago for the service, which will be held on Wednesday and will feature the hymn 'I Vow to Thee, My Country'. Alongside the hymn, which was sung at the funeral of Princess Diana in 1997, a poem by William Wordsworth will be read out as part of a service expected to reflect Baroness Thatcher's strong Christian faith. She instructed whoever was Prime Minister at the time of her death, regardless of political affiliation, to deliver a reading. David Cameron is expected to read a specific hymn, John 14.1, which says: 'Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.' The 19-year-old granddaughter of the UK's first female prime minister will read another lesson from the King James Bible, the Daily Telegraph reported. The funeral, to be held at St Paul's Cathedral, will also feature readings from the Book of Common Prayer, including one that says: 'Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live and is full of misery.' She is understood to have begun preparations for her funeral nearly a decade ago, and it is understood St Paul's clerics visited Lady Thatcher in person about her wishes. The funeral, which will be attended by the Queen, will be held at St Paul's Cathedral in London . She was determined to have Wordsworth's . ode on immortality included, which reads: 'Thanks to the human heart by . which we live,/ Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears'. Carol Thatcher returned to Britain on Friday to help with the preparations for her mother’s funeral. Baroness Thatcher's military victory in the Falklands will be reflected in her funeral service on Wednesday. Outside St Paul's Cathedral, the gun carriage carrying the former prime minister's coffin will be greeted by a guard of honour formed of 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, the regiment which lost 32 men in the bombing of the troop ship Sir Galahad during the 1982 conflict. The 10-strong bearer party has been deliberately selected from ships, units and stations 'notable for their service during the Falklands campaign'. Hundreds of members of the Armed Forces, drawn from the Army, the Navy, and the RAF, will line the route of the funeral cortege as it travels the two miles from Westminster to the cathedral. The Welsh and Scots Guards, the Parachute Regiment, the Gurkhas and the Royal Marines - all units that fought in the Falklands - have all been given a role in the ceremony. Miss Thatcher, who lives in Klosters, Switzerland, arrived at her mother’s home in Belgravia shortly before 7pm. She arrived in a black Jaguar accompanied by a casually dressed man believed to be her boyfriend Marco Grass. A long list of celebrities, old friends and foes will join royalty and world leaders past and present to pay their last respects to Britain's greatest peacetime prime minister. Before the carefully planned service, . MPs and peers will be able to pay their respects to Baroness Thatcher in . Parliament's Chapel of St Mary Undercroft on the eve of her funeral. The chapel will be open on Tuesday evening so members and staff from both Houses can visit the former prime minister's coffin, it was announced last night. Around 100 people will also be invited to a short service led by the Dean of Westminster welcoming Lady Thatcher's body. Downing Street said Lady Thatcher had requested her body rest overnight in the historic chapel, and the Queen had given her consent. 'There will be a short service for around 100 people, led by the Dean of Westminster, to receive the body of Baroness Thatcher in the chapel,' a spokesman said. The service will not be a public event and will be attended by the family and senior figures from both Houses. The remaining seats in the chapel will be offered to members and staff who knew or worked closely with Lady Thatcher or who served her in some personal capacity such as housekeepers who looked after her office in the Houses of Parliament. It is understood Lady Thatcher's body will arrive at the Palace of Westminster by hearse, and leave again by hearse without a formal ceremony. Carol Thatcher arrives back at her mother's house to help with the funeral arrangements, which her mother made years ago . The funeral . guest list drawn up by Lady Thatcher's family, with advice from . Whitehall, includes all surviving former British prime ministers, all . former US presidents and a representative of former South African . president Nelson Mandela. Almost . all of the world's current heads of state are being asked to attend or . send representatives – a move which, along with the highly unusual . presence of the Queen, effectively elevates it to a state occasion. A . multi-million pound security operation for Baroness Thatcher's funeral . was last night being planned by police, as fears grew that next . Wednesday's occasion could be disrupted by protesters. Officers . will line the entire route from Westminster to St Paul's Cathedral to . prevent disorder from a minority who have been celebrating the death of . Britain's first and only female prime minister. The £8million ceremonial funeral, with full military honours, will start in the capital at 11am. Baroness Thatcher is also expected to be remembered - along with her late husband Sir Denis - by a plaque at a church in a village with which he had family connections. Sir Denis, who died aged 88 in 2003, wrote a provision in his will that a memorial should be put up to the couple at St Mary's Church in Uffington, Oxfordshire, after his wife's death. The Rev Rosanna Martin, the vicar, said today: 'Provided the Oxford diocese agrees, I would expect somebody to design a plaque dedicated to the couple which would join the six other plaques to various Thatchers on the south porch of the church.' Sir Denis had requested the trustees of his £1.3m estate to erect a plaque, according to the Times. Even her detractors would concede that Baroness Thatcher was a woman who knew her own mind, a quality demonstrated by the fact that she left detailed instructions for her own funeral service. The patriotic verses of I Vow To Thee, My Country, will ring out in St Paul's Cathedral next Wednesday as per the former prime minister's specific request. She also selected hymns To Be A Pilgrim and Love Divine, All Loves Excelling, and asked that lines from poet William Wordsworth's ode on immortality be read out. Baroness Thatcher also instructed that the serving prime minister at the time of her death should read a letter from the Gospels, and as such David Cameron is expected to deliver the passage John 14:1. The reading says: 'Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. 'I go to prepare a place for you.' The Tory icon's 19-year-old granddaughter Amanda - who lives in the U.S. with her mother Diane Beckett, ex-wife of Sir Mark Thatcher - is also expected to deliver a reading at the ceremonial funeral next week.","Baroness believed to have begun preparations eight years ago .

"A Massachusetts man said he was in 'complete shock' upon discovering that he was likely the father of at least two of four children authorities took from the house he shared with his girlfriend, and where the corpses of three infants were discovered. That man is the live-in boyfriend of Erika Murray, 31, now being held on felony charges including concealing fetal death and permitting substantial injury to a child after in the wake of the horrific August discovery of three infant corpses in the house on 23 St. Paul Street. Ramon Rivera III's reaction was relayed to reporters by a friend who wished to remain anonymous but said he spoke with the accused shortly after Rivera met with the state Department of Children and Families. The live-in boyfriend of Erika Murray, 31, says he was shocked to learn he's likely the father of her four surviving children . The anonymous source told The Boston Globe that for the last three years he had a regular seat at a card game held in Rivera and Murray's basement. On August 28, four living children ages 5 months and 3, 10 and 13 years were taken from the home. They are now under the supervision of the Department of Children and Families. The remains of the infant corpses were discovered on Wednesday and Thursday. Rivera was asked to meet with authorities shortly after the bodies were recovered. Simply cleaning the home took 90 hours at an estimated cost of $25,000. Upon learning that the two youngest children were definitely his - and that the older two likely were as well - Rivera's friend said he was 'in absolute, complete shock.' Both 'condemned' and 'keep out' signs are attached behind police tape to the front door of a house where a Massachusetts prosecutor said the bodies of three infants were found . 'Just like everyone else, he also thinks he should have known. She had everybody fooled,' the anonymous source said. Rivera is charged with growing marijuana in the house's basement. He has not, however, been charged in connection to the squalid conditions on the house's second floor where the children were kept. 'He wants the truth to be his support,' the friend said. Rivera also claimed to have been ignorant of the second floor's state as he often slept on the couch in the basement. Boyfriend Ramon Rivera has not been charged in connection to the squalid conditions on the house's second floor where the children were kept . There is a separate basement entrance that Rivera and his friend regularly used for card games. Murray had recently started working at Shaw's after a job at McDonald's where she and Rivera had both worked. While she had recently lost weight, friends say her home wasn't as bad as authorities have reported. 'She seemed a little lost,' said former co-worker Sabrina Wilson, 29. 'Like she was missing something.' Wilson agreed that Rivera spent most of his time in the basement, retreating from the family. 'He'd get home, give her a kiss, talk to the kids, see how their day at school was, and go to the basement,' she said. Police have been called to the house for several incidents over the last decade. Calls at the house resulted in reports on several occasions between October 2000 and March 2007, often relating to Rivera. The house is owned by Rivera's sister, Kristin Rivera. Calls at the house resulted in reports on several occasions between October 2000 and March 2007, often relating to Rivera. In May 2005 she was listed as 'calling party' in an incident where a child playing with the phone dialed 911. Another child's absence from school resulted in a police call in 2005. Murray talked to police about a 'medical transport of another party' in 2007. She called police again in May to complain about a dead cat on the sidewalk. 'While we will all wonder what could have been done to prevent this terrible tragedy, our officers continued to do their jobs well, and no one could have predicted the scene that investigators would find last week,' said Police Chief Ross Atstupenas.","Ramon Rivera III may be father of all four of Erika Murray's four surviving children .

Independently designed and handcrafted over 30 years by local builder Brian Rumble, the home built as a real-life castle complete with battlements . Complete with stain glass windows, hand carved gargoyles, Gothic arches and curves and sweeping corridors with high ceilings and cobwebs-to-boot, the haunting fortress stands out from any other property, Harcourts agent Julie Andrews told Daily Mail Australia. 'Stone, slate, timber, clay carvings, led light glass timber, sweeping staircases and a hatch that you can turn which opens and lets you walk right through until you're at the top of a battlement torrent and you can see right up above the mountain ranges and beyond,' Ms Andrews said as she described the magnificent building. 'There's no comparison out there for this type of property,' she said, adding that no expected price for the house has been made public. She described Mr Rumble as 'an eccentric, shy man with a lot of creative ability and artistic flair', adding, 'the degree of detail that he has used to create the tiniest of carvings is outstanding.' The video features a group of actors, dressed as moaning zombies, pouring out of the castles stone foyer before being shot down by an invisible shotgun . Stepping over the zombie carcasses, Harcourts estate agent, Julie Andrews, then emerges to clean the screen . It's no wonder then, that the marketing agents opted for a different way to attract buyers as unique and eccentric as the building itself, which has been used as a tourist destination as well as hosting medieval games, corporate events and even weddings. 'We decided that we needed a different spin, we needed something fairly clever and with a high impact that was a high draw card for the audience we needed,' Ms Andrews said. 'We thought, ""yep, zombies pouring out of that courtyard with those timber doors is definitely a great idea"".' In the video, Ms Andrews says to viewers: 'Well, now that I've cleaned the place up - time to come and have a look inside' A second marketing video for the house, soon to be released, will feature a virtual tour of the property . The haunting fortress features stain glass windows, hand carved gargoyles, sweeping corridors and staircases and a wooden hatch that leads to the battlements . The first marketing video for the property, features a group of actors, dressed as ragged, moaning zombies, pouring out of the castles stone foyer before being shot down by an invisible shotgun. Ms Andrews also features in the video, and is shown exiting the property from the same doorway before stepping her way across the carcases to wipe up the blood from the camera lense. 'Well, now that I've cleaned the place up – time to come and have a look inside,'’ Ms Andrews says in the video. It served as a family home to the Rumble family, who lived in a cottage 300 metres from the structure while it was still in its early development stages . The castle has served as a tourist destination as well as hosting medieval games, corporate events and even weddings . 'I've had emails going off, phones going off, all sorts of inquiries from normal residential buyers, mums and dads looking for something a little different, business owners, historical soicietys photographers looking for galleries and even genuine developers. There's a huge range of people who are interested,' she said. 'No one has said it's not acceptable for a real-estate agent to be killing zombies while  marketing a property.' The video is to be followed by a second, which will provide viewers with a virtual tour of the buildings.","The Rumble Castle was designed and handcrafted by a local builder .

"‘Dear Mummy and Daddy,’ reads the looping blue handwriting on Snoopy writing paper. ‘I am getting along very well. But I am still crying slightly because I am missing you very much.’ That letter was written 35 years ago by my husband, Guy, then aged eight. It was two weeks into his first term at boarding school and he was desperately homesick, but obviously trying to be brave. His mother showed us the letter a couple of weeks ago, as we were discussing where to send our own children, Will, 11, and Alice, nine, when they move to senior school. Scroll down for video . Annabel Venning has been discussing with husband Guy whether or not to send their children Alice, nine, and Will, 11 to boarding school . As I read it, my heart broke for that homesick little boy, far from home aged only eight. When Guy told me that he used to cry for three days at the beginning of every term, after every weekend visit and half-term, I felt even sadder. Then I remembered that, when I went off to board at the same age, I would struggle not to cry as I said goodbye to my parents at train stations or airport departure gates (my father was in the Army, so lived abroad for much of my childhood). Only years later did my mother tell me that once I had gone through the departure gate, she would start sobbing. On the plane, I would weep in my seat as kindly stewardesses doled out tissues. Even so, when we had our children, Guy and I assumed that they would follow in our footsteps to boarding school. Guy, aged eight, and the letter he sent to his parents about being upset at boarding school  which nearly broke Annabel's heart . For when we look back at our schooldays and reminisce with old friends, it’s never those wretched, tear-stained stories we remember. It’s the pillow fights in the dormitories; the daring raids on the Mars Bar stores in the headmaster’s study; friends available to play at all times; glorious grounds to roam; building log cabins; growing vegetables in our own allotments; playing hide and seek; and climbing ancient trees. We thrived at prep school. After those emotional goodbyes, I smothered thoughts of home and never once shed a tear after walking through the big wooden door of the magnificent Jacobean mansion that housed my school in Dorset. There were animals everywhere: the teachers’ dogs followed them into the classroom (and sometimes made rather inappropriate advances on our legs as we stood in line). Ponies grazed in the fields and we could ride them before breakfast in the summer. A pet sheep wandered around the gardens. True, there weren’t as many midnight feasts as I’d been led to expect from my Enid Blyton books, but I was happy, as my own chirpy letters home testified (they were read by a teacher before being sent, so we couldn’t moan to our parents about the grey, gristly meat we were fed or the scary matron who chased us into bed with a riding crop). Nowadays, boarding school pupils can phone or email home whenever they like. The schools are more luxurious, less eccentric places than they were 30 years ago. I doubt many children have to wear a dressing gown and slippers in bed to keep warm as I did in the draughty dorm. Nor, I imagine, are children punished, as I was for talking after lights out, by being sent to sit in the dark on the ‘haunted’ staircase. But when our children neared the age at which we had been sent away, we baulked at the idea — and not just because of the eye-watering fees. They just seemed far too young. I asked the headmaster of one prep school, where boarding is compulsory from the age of 11, what happened if a child was homesick; could they go home? Annabel as a child. She says she thrived at boarding school, smothering thoughts of home after walking through the school doors . ‘We find it’s only the mothers who cry,’ he said, as though mothers’ feelings were of little consequence and every child loved boarding. But, of course, that’s not the case. I know of several happy boarders, but I also know mothers who have to peel their weeping children off them every time they return to school and who regularly receive distraught texts and phone calls begging to come home. Surely that must have a long-term impact? One of my best friends at prep school used to cry for her parents every night. She’s still too upset at the memory to talk about it. Another remembers feeling utterly bewildered as to why she couldn’t go home at night. ‘I felt lost for four years,’ she says. What if one of our children was homesick? The idea of them crying for us, even if only for a few nights, as in Guy’s case, is unbearable. And while modern boarding staff are probably more sympathetic than in our day, they cannot love our children for us. Annabel says her education was first class but she finds herself wincing at the thought of her children boarding . Moreover, we are not under the same pressures our parents faced — we work from home. So we opted instead for the excellent local primary school and, when that didn’t work out for our son, moved him to a lovely prep school where he is a day boy. Will has tried boarding for the occasional night, but once when we went away and he had to board for four nights, he told me: ‘It’s OK for a night or two, but after that I really missed you. It’s weird being without your parents at night.’ He’s right. There is nothing natural about young children living away from home. Nowadays, few children board full-time at eight as we did. Even so, I’m amazed at how many people send off their children at 11 — despite average fees of £30,000 a year. Indeed, despite concerns raised by psychiatrists that boarding is damaging for young children, it is increasingly popular — boarding numbers were up by 1 per cent last year and there are a growing number of state boarding schools. Now that we are trying to choose senior schools for our two, we are facing the dilemma afresh. We went to traditional public schools at 13, where we continued to board. The education was first class, we did well academically and went on to good universities. And yet I find myself wincing at the thought of my children doing the same. Even if they can flexi-board or weekly board, I hate the idea that they will do so much of their growing up without me. Recently, I’ve met several people (mostly men in their 40s) who said: ‘I’ve got nothing in common with my parents because I didn’t grow up with them — I went to boarding school.’ Some attribute relationship problems or mental breakdowns to being deprived of parental support during the crucial teenage years. I don’t feel like that. I am close to my parents and never felt abandoned — after all, they had little choice. And yet, even though I made lasting friendships at school, there were times I would have dearly loved to go home and have a hug from the people who cared the most — my mum and dad. The teenage years are tough. Your body changes, friendships are more intense but less secure, and everyone fights for their place in the pecking order. Girls, particularly, can be cliquey and mean. It’s the same at any school, but if you can’t get away for a few hours, it can feel relentless. We adapted by ‘fitting in’, becoming clones of each other, dressing, talking and flicking our hair the same way. Conscious as I am that I was incredibly lucky to have had such a good education, I wonder if being part of ‘normal’ life might be healthier than living, seven days a week, in a community where contact with the outside world is minimal. Modern boarding schools have incredible facilities (as well they might at £10,000 a term) and offer endless activities at weekends. But sometimes all a teenage girl wants to do on a Saturday afternoon is take the bus into town to go to Topshop with her friends. I’d like my children to have a great education and a normal life. Being a day pupil, whether at private or state school, is the best guarantee of that, I’m sure. Perhaps I am being naive. Maybe when our children become grunting, texting, grumpy teenagers and we are fed up with being a taxi service, we will be remortgaging the house and digging out boarding school prospectuses. But for now, I am glad they can confide in me, not their teddy bear, and that every night I get to kiss their foreheads as they sleep — for a few more years at least.","Annabel says her education was first class but she finds herself wincing at the thought of her children boarding .

"Murder charge: Richard E. Madden has been charged over the death of schoolgirl Kami Ring . The 'uncle' of a 10-year-old girl whose body was found in a field on Monday, has been charged with her murder and rape. Biological evidence has allegedly linked Richard E. Madden, 29, to the death of Kami Ring, who died of blunt force trauma and asphyxia. The body of the straight A student was found on Monday evening, in an overgrown field across the street from a Port Deposit home where she had been staying with a couple whom she considered her grandparents. The Clark couple's son, Madden, shared their home. Kami's mother Sacha, was said to be relieved that Madden had been charged. Her husband, Richard Dean, said: 'For the most part, we have closure that we know we have the right person.' After going to a carnival on Sunday, Kami had aasked her parents if she could spend the week at Clark’s house, the Washington Post said. 'She packed up and took her clothes and that’s the last we saw her,' Mr Dean said. He said the couple had been asked to identify photographs of shoes and pants belonging to their daughter. Madden, who has a string of past arrests, was charged after officers found the substances during a search of the Port Deposit home he shared with his parents - two people Kami had for years considered her grandparents though they were not related to her. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tragic: Kami had been to a carnival on Sunday before staying with a couple she considered her grandparents . Madden, whose most recent job was at Denny's restaurant in Perryville, is being held on a retake warrant related to conditions tied to his 2012 parole, according to ABC News. According to court records, Madden . pleaded guilty to theft in 2009 and was sentenced to five years' jail . but was released last fall. Kami, who lived in Charlestown, Maryland, with her mother, stepfather and two younger siblings, was staying at her so-called grandparents' home for the weekend. No other family members were with her. It is the second time a child has been murdered in the family. In 1994, while living in Oregon, Kami's . mother Ring was sentenced to two years in prison over criminal . mistreatment and criminally negligent homicide in the death of her . eight-month-old son. Earlier in the week, her devastated stepfather called the little girl's death 'an inside job.' 'With all the information that I've gotten it has to be an inside job,' Ricky Dean told WBAL-TV. 'We have taught her to scream at the top of her lungs if something ever happened.' Model student: Kami, pictured left and right, was a straight A student at her Charlestown school . Tragic: Kami Ring, pictured, was found dead on Monday and on Tuesday night her uncle was arrested . He added that Kami was a straight-A . student at Charlestown Elementary School. 'She was a model 10-year old. The best kid you could ever have,' he said. Brittany Dotson, who got to know Kami at Cecil County Girls and Boys club where she attended afterschool care each afternoon, broke down as she described the 10-year-old who loved to laugh, sing and dance. She added that Kami was fiercely protective of her half-brother, Joe, a third-grader, and half-sister, Lizzy, a second-grader. 'She was one of a kind,' Dotson said. 'She was the sweetest. Her brother and sister were everything to her. She was amazing in every way. I just don't understand.' The shocking discovery of the little girl's body on Monday rocked the Port Deposit community. Kami disappeared from her bedroom in the middle of the night and the Clarks reported her missing at around 11am on Monday. After a seven-hour search, her lifeless body was discovered in a field near a shed just 60 yards in front of their home. The little girl was pronounced dead at the scene.

"A decade ago the Slovakian handball player Maros Kolpak laughed out loud when this reporter told him his name had become synonymous with a new species of county cricketer. The news that ‘Kolpak’ may now be considered a term of racist abuse is unlikely to attract the same response. Certainly, no-one at Yorkshire — whose captain, Andrew Gale, finds himself at the centre of a racism storm — is laughing. According to reports, as yet not denied, Gale told Lancashire’s South African batsman Ashwell Prince during a recent County Championship match at Old Trafford to: ‘F*** off back to your own country, you Kolpak f*****.’ Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale (right) has become the first county cricketer to be accused of using racial language after a verbal altercation with Ashwell Prince (left) during the Roses match earlier this month . He now must appear before a disciplinary hearing next week to answer a charge of racial verbal abuse. He is said to be devastated. Legal constraints mean both the ECB and Yorkshire are staying tight-lipped about the details. But a truism still applies: a charge of racism is far easier to make than it is to prove. It is also a scar that cannot be removed. People are not dubbed racist: they are branded. Gale’s outburst was unpleasant, even if it turns out to be the case that he was provoked by Prince. The best that can be said about telling someone to go back to their own country — whether or not it is spiced up by swear words or fuelled by adrenaline — is that it is deeply crass. Throw in the Kolpak jibe — a reference to cricketers from outside the EU who play domestically in England without adding to a county’s overseas quota — and it could be argued that Gale insulted Prince on the grounds of his ‘national origin’, one of the terms of reference in the ECB’s code of conduct. Gale's County Championship title celebrations were affected by the accusations . But racism? Even those minded to take extra offence because of Prince’s ethnicity — he is mixed race — might concede it cannot possibly be that straightforward. If Gale’s intention was to lambast Prince because he felt he was taking up a place in the county game that might otherwise have gone to a promising English youngster, then his sledge arguably contained a crude logic. Yet it should be clear that to agree with Gale’s sentiment is not to condone racism. The ECB need to tread carefully. On the day Gale clashed with Prince, Moeen Ali — a Birmingham-born Muslim of Pakistani heritage — was jeered by Indian fans during a one-day international at Edgbaston. Five days later, during a Twenty20 international at the same venue, he was subjected to a second dose of mindlessness. The newly-crowned champions immediately vowed to fight to clear the name of their captain Gale . The ECB said almost nothing, save to ‘condemn abusive language or behaviour of any sort at cricket’. It is not an immediately reassuring approach that glosses over cat-calling by several thousand spectators while zeroing in on the less clear-cut motivation of an individual cricketer. It is tempting to conclude that some targets are easier than others. This is about more than semantics, and about more than the precise nature of what prompted Gale to say what he did, which we can never know for sure. It’s about the importance of not diminishing the awfulness of racism for those who can claim, without hesitation or legal argument, to have been its victim. Call Gale misguided, if you like. Call him thoughtless. But if you’re going to suggest he’s racist, you should be armed with more than a smart lawyer to prove your point.

"Getting into character: David Suchet, pictured in Agatha Christie's Poirot: Appointment With Death, has revealed he squeezes his bottom while walking to perfect the character's unusual walk . Actor David Suchet has told of the lengths he went to in order to perfect Hercule Poirot's distinctive walk when he first took the role. The actor, 67, said he wanted to get right his character's 'rapid, mincing gait', as described by Poirot's creator Agatha Christie. Suchet, who plays the famous detective for the last time in ITV's Curtain: Poirot's Last Case later this month, told the Radio Times: 'I took that (Christie's) description and I practised and practised and practised. 'Laurence Olivier, when he was playing a fop in a Restoration play, wanted to mince ... and famously he put a penny in the crack of his bottom and walked and wouldn't let it drop. If you do that, you can't walk fast, so I did the same thing.' Asked whether he had to use the penny trick for the last 24 years, Suchet replied: 'No, but what I made myself do when I wanted to walk like Poirot was to squeeze my bottom. 'That makes you walk with short strides and that's all I do. If you think of Poirot and how he walks - that precise little thing is very much who he is. He is not a man of broad, relaxed gestures.' Suchet said it was emotional saying goodbye to the mustachioed detective after so long in the role. 'I quite openly admit that doing Poirot's final scene was the hardest day's filming of my career. And it was hard because that is the end ... for me,' he said. 'I know there's going to be a new book (written by Sophie Hannah) so that's going to be strange to see him resurrected - depending on where she places him. But that will probably be it for me.' Suchet, who said he was about to accept a job offer to become a junior manager at menswear store Moss Bros when he was called to say he had been offered a small role in The Protectors, said he had never forgotten what it was like 'to be broke' before his acting career took off. 'If you've got nothing, they say there's nothing to worry about. But not in our society. If you've got nothing, there's plenty to worry about. 'Those who haven't anything are very aware they haven't and it's very, very hard for them and it was very hard for me and it was very hard for my wife,' he added.

"The rise to the throne of Queen Victoria in 1837 marked the decline of the use of cosmetics and the era fast became synonymous with strict moral code, sexual restraint and minimal make-up. But while cosmetics were considered to be immoral during this period, a book originally published in the Victorian era and republished for a modern audience today reveals that self-improvement was very much still on the agenda. A Lady, Beauty, What It Is and How to Retain It, which was originally published in 1873, has been re-released by The British Library and sheds light on the tricks of the Victorian beauty trade. Time capsule: A Lady, Beauty, What It Is and How to Retain It, which was first published in 1873, has been re-released and shares Victorian beauty secrets . The practical guide divulges beauty secrets and tips such as how to make your own hair tonics and face . masks using products such as lard and beef marrow. It also explains the value of brushing hair for a lengthy 20 minutes both night and day, and instructs women to use a soft badger-hair brush to clean their . teeth. It adds: 'Paint is used, we believe, by some absurd women, on the lips - we need scarcely say to their ultimate injury and always at the user's peril.' At the time, it was actresses and prostitutes who wore bold make-up, whilst upper class women used very little and in very . natural tones. Still relevant: Much of the advice is still relevant for the modern day beauty fan and there is also a guide for men, The Gentleman's Art of Dressing, With Economy , written by 'A Lounger at the Clubs' in 1876 . Much of the advice still has relevance to the modern reader, such as the comment that 'perfect cleanliness is essential to the preservation of the teeth', whilst other parts serve as a reminder of the age in which the book was written: 'The water used for washing the skin should be rain-water, but if London rain-water, it must be filtered to clear it from smuts.' There is also a guide for men, The Gentleman's Art of Dressing, With Economy, written by 'A Lounger at the Clubs' in 1876. The quirky guide, which is priced at £7.95 like its women's counterpart, offers advice on dealing with a wet top hat and emphasises the importance of not wearing the same trousers two days in a row.","British Library has re-released the two guides, originally published in 1873 and 1876 .

"Trolled: Claire Goodwin, 31, was hounded on Twitter after she was the first person to be thrown off of the Great British Bake Off . The first contestant to leave the Great British Bake Off has hit back after being trolled on Twitter by viewers calling her 'fat' and a 'cry baby'.

Viewer Sarah Burr said: 'Claire you're amazing', while another used described her as a 'legend and inspiration' to us all. Rhiain Geers-Davies said: 'Shocked at horrid people out there,' while Claire Nash added: 'Not impressed Claire has gone from Bake Off at all!' Mrs Goodwin herself took to the social media site to tell fans she was 'ignoring the GBBO party carnage'. She posted: 'Sticks and stones will break my bones (well,maybe not owing to my apparently gargantuan level of blubber:WIN) but names will never hurt me. The contestant admitted she became 'ridiculously worked up' over the cake and the pressure saw her burst into tears.

Posting on her blog, Mrs Goodwin said that she had set up the Twitter account shortly before the hit BBC show had aired, saying that she had found it 'fun' and 'exciting'. But she said that she quickly became preoccupied with what people were saying, and would become absorbed in negative reactions. She said: 'I heard of the trolls and the keyboard warriors out there, sitting in an anonymous room, projecting their misery onto others through insults and unkind words. Abuse: .

She continued saying that 'a person should not be defined by any aspect of their appearance.' Mrs Goodwin added that she had received support from last year's Great British Bake Off winner Ruby Tandoh, who yesterday wrote an article slamming online trolls.

"Sunderland manager Gus Poyet has revealed he dropped Steven Fletcher a few weeks ago to fire him up — a strategy that paid dividends when the Scottish striker scored his first goals in almost 10 months on Saturday to give Sunderland their first win of the season. Asked if he dropped the player to make him angry, Poyet said: ‘Yes, but I didn’t do it for that reason alone. I needed to change something. He was not very happy for a few days but there were no problems. 'I am not a manager who will sit and accept things. You always try and help the team and I made a strong decision. It is not personal. It is always for the benefit of the team.’ Steven Fletcher scored twice against Stoke on Saturday to end a 10 month barren spell . Steven Fletcher celebrates scoring Sunderland's second goal in the 3-1 win over Stoke . Steven Fletcher celebrates scoring his second and Sunderland's third goal against Stoke . Steven Fletcher had not scored any goal in 17 games stretching back to October last year before scoring twice against Stoke . ‘The good thing is I am always looking for a way to win. It is not personal. It is always for the benefit of the team. We needed some presence in the box from players who really want to score. I needed hunger from players who wanted to score.’ Fletcher was the stand-out performer as he laid on Connor Wickham’s opener and then struck either side of the break after Charlie Adam had equalised. ‘It has been a frustrating time,’ Fletcher said. ‘I feel like I’ve been doing quite well in training so when you are not in the squad it is very frustrating but I’ve just had to keep my head down and take my chance when I got it and I did that.’ Gus Poyet has revealed that Steven Fletcher was not happy about being dropped . Sunderland had started the season with five draws and one defeat. ‘It’s massive that we are off the mark now,’ Fletcher said. ‘We have been putting in good performances but the results haven’t been coming. Everything came together for us today and it is a huge relief to get the win.’ On Fletcher’s reaction to being dropped, Poyet added: ‘He was not very happy for a few days and clearly didn’t like the decision. But there were no problems or complaints. Of course as a professional footballer he won’t be happy because he wants to play. ‘[The goals] told me he should be playing week in week out. It is good to know he can play like he did because his whole game not just the finishing is very good.’","Fletcher scored twice in Sunderland's 3-1 win over Stoke .

"Supercars are always something of a status symbol and Ferraris come pretty high up even that lofty hierarchy. However, for kickboxing world champion Riyadh Al-Azzawi just buying one of the flashest cars on the market isn't enough. The Iraqi fighter went even further, wrapping his £200,000 458 Spider with gold vinyl - for the comparably reasonable price tag of £4,000. The £200,000 supercar belongs to kickboxing world champion Riyadh Al-Azzawi . The car, capable of a top speed of 199mph, was snapped while the fighter was training in a nearby gym .

"Found: An autopsy showed preliminary results that Katelyn Wolfe, who disappeared from her home on June 6, died from asphyxia . Two men charged with murdering a 19-year-old girl and updating her Facebook afterwards to hide their actions allegedly told police they did it because they 'wanted to know what it feels like'. Jordan Buskirk, 26, and Randall Crosley, 25, from Jasonville, Indiana, have been charged with the murder of Katelyn Wolfe. The teen went missing from her Linton, Indiana, home on June 6. Her body was found four days later in a lake bound with duct tape and rope, with an anchor attached to her body. Investigators revealed today that Buskirk described the slaying as 'just something that popped into their heads'. Court documents state: 'Jordan Buskirk explained that he and Randal Crosley had previous . conversations about forcing themselves on a complete stranger for at . least a week. 'The initial plan was to rape and then . murder. Jordan Buskirk explained that it was just something that popped into . their heads. He advised that it just crossed their heads to try to do . it. 'He explained that they were not targeting Katelyn Wolfe, but they were . just going to target somebody. Jordan Buskirk explained . that the opportunity was just there for Katelyn Wolfe.' The men used Katelyn's phone to update her Facebook status after they murdered her, police said. It read: 'Trying to party looking for fun. Out on a walk with creeps that keep driving by.' Buskirk and Crosley face charges of  conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit rape and criminal confinement. Police were told by Buskirk that he and Crosley had bought handcuffs, condoms, restraint straps, rope and a 20-pound weight, in preparation for a rape and murder, the Indy Star reports. Charged: Police arrested Jordan Buskirk, 26, left, and Randall Crosley, 25, from nearby Jasonville in connection with Wolfe’s death . The probable cause affidavit stated . that the two men picked up Wolfe at around 1am and drove around doing . drugs before tying her up with duct tape, strangling her with a rope and . killing her. It is alleged that the two men then . put Wolfe in the back of their car, updated her Facebook status and then . threw her in the lake with 20-pound weights strapped to her body. Linton Police Chief Troy Jerrell said the family was able to confirm the body was Katelyn from a photograph provided by investigators. He also said the two men are believed to have intentionally killed Wolfe: 'They knew what they were doing all along,' Jerrell told ABC News . affiliate WRTV in Indianapolis. 'We don't believe it was an accidental . type thing.' He declined to elaborate on what led police to the suspects, who were both being held at the Greene County Jail in Bloomfield.

"If Norwich City stumble upon a little bit of good fortune this season, then God help the rest of the Championship. On Saturday evening, despite his team sitting top of the table, Neil Adams was still convinced and concerned that the footballing deities had deserted him. 'They say these things even themselves out over the season and we've had our share of bad luck,' Adams lamented. Norwich boss Neil Adams was frustrated with his side's 1-1 draw with Rotherham - his team have not won at home since mid-August . Cameron Jerome scored Norwich's equaliser against Rotherham but missed good chances during the match . 'You normally get one a season but we've had freak games back-to-back.' The Norwich manager certainly could be forgiven for feeling a sense of deja vu. On Saturday, as in Tuesday's 1-0 home defeat by Charlton, his team had created enough chances against Rotherham to win four or five games but saw precious points slip through their fingers. But they remain top after  rivals Ipswich did them a favour by holding Nottingham Forest to a draw on Sunday. The Canaries fell behind to Rotherham courtesy of Paul Green's penalty having had the better of the match . It certainly is freakish that the Canaries are flying so high having not won at home in the league since mid-August. Not since Newcastle United returned to the top tier in one attempt in 2009-2010 has a side relegated from the Premier League started so well in the division below — but Adams was justified in thinking they should have more. Norwich lost 1-0 at home against Charlton despite completely dominating the game from start to finish . 'It's an opportunity lost,' he continued. 'We've totally dominated and again I've got an opposition manager saying: 'I don't know how the hell we've got anything from that.'' Rotherham's Steve Evans had a point. This was an afternoon of yellow-shirted dominance. Nathan Redmond rampaged down the right, Martin Olsson stormed down the left. Crosses whizzed in pretty much every minute. Cameron Jerome had four good opportunities before he finally made one count. Norwich crafted 27 openings in all but lacked ruthlessness. Despite the two dropped points, the manner of the performance still showed that Norwich this season — in contrast to Fulham and Cardiff — are a textbook example of how to cope with life after the Premier League. Adams believes that with players like Lewis Grabban (right), the team will start winning home matches . Having played 206 times for the club and taking charge of the academy, Adams was rightly given his chance at the top job. With some quality players retained and a revamped front line of Jerome (seven goals so far) and Lewis Grabban (six) they have hit the ground running. Adams added: 'There's very little wrong with the performances. It just isn't going our way, particularly at home.' The October internationals are a good time to take stock and Evans, too, can be content with how things are going. His Rotherham side were not without clear-cut chances and took the lead when Paul Green rolled home a penalty after John Ruddy had clattered Matt Derbyshire. Norwich remained top of the championship after Nottingham Forest drew 2-2 with Ipswich on Sunday . After four successive promotion seasons — two with Crawley Town, two with the Millers — Evans is probably finding it a little frustrating to sit 17th, and he said as much afterwards. 'We're five or six points light of where we deserve to be,' he said. 'Those who watched us against Brentford and Watford (both 2-0 defeats) saw total domination in both games. And if you'd watched us at Ipswich (another 2-0 defeat), you'd think Rotherham were the established Championship team. We've embraced it.' What's caught my eye . Ian Holloway's comments when asked if Millwall were in crisis following their draw at Derby: 'Crisis is what is happening to people who go out to work for Christian Aid and lose their life.' Plenty of incident in the Chesterfield vs Sheffield United derby, with Blades striker Michael Higdon and Spireites keeper Tommy Lee seeing red. Chesterfield won 3-2. Colin Cooper resigned as Hartlepool United manager after a 3-0 home defeat to fellow strugglers Carlisle left them rock bottom of League Two. Performance of the week . Joy for Blackpool at long last on Friday as they beat Cardiff 1-0 to drag themselves off the foot of the Championship — a first win of the season. Could it be the start of a great escape? Francois Zoko (centre right) scored the only goal of the game for Blackpool in their 1-0 win against Cardiff .","Norwich City could only draw 1-1 with Rotherham on Saturday .

"A harrowing video filmed by the Kenyan Red Cross shows responders rushing to help the injured shortly after the assault on the Westgate mall began. The footage, obtained by The Associated Press, shows rescuers entering the Nairobi's mall's upper level parking area on September 31 and treating the injured as bodies lie on the pavement. The end of the graphic video appears to show several seriously wounded and dead people where a children's cooking event had been taking place. Injured people are wailing and calling out for help. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Harrowing: The Kenyan Red Cross treats the injured from the mall attack . Bloodbath: Paramedics tended to the injured as the gunmen continued to roam the mall . A sixth Briton has been confirmed dead following the atrocity, the Foreign Office said today. Earlier this week Prime Minister David Cameron suggested six Britons may have died in the catastrophe and the Foreign Office confirmed this figure on Saturday. The person's identity has not been revealed. A spokesman said: 'FCO can confirm a sixth British national has been identified amongst those killed in the tragedy in Nairobi. We are providing consular assistance. 'We have no information at this time that any further British nationals have been killed although we cannot rule out the potential for further British casualties and we continue to stay in close contact with the Kenyan authorities as their investigations continue.' The video comes as hundreds of mourners and security personnel have held a 24-hour candlelight vigil for victims of the massacre. Inside the mall on Friday - the last . of three days of an official mourning period - a pushchair could be seen . overturned on the marble floor next to wilting fresh flowers at a . florist's shop. Slabs of concrete sat on top of flattened cars in the . parking area. Elsewhere, there were rows of scorched vehicles. Mourning: People light candles during a memorial service in front of the shopping centre . Prayer: A father lights candles with his son during the 24-hour vigil . In memory: Kenya Defense Forces soldiers pay tribute to victims of the terrorist attack . Earlier, . a top official said Kenya's military caused the collapse of three . floors of the mall in the deadly terrorist siege as the government urged . patience with the pace of an investigation that has left key questions . unanswered. Seven . days after 67 people were killed in the attack on the upmarket shopping . centre, there is still no clear word on the fate of dozens who have . been reported missing and no details on the terrorists who carried it . out. Atrocity: A woman who had been hiding during the gun battle runs for cover after armed police enter the Westgate Mall in Nairobi . Aftermath: Kenyan security personnel direct traffic after the main road next to the Westgate Mall was reopened, in Nairobi, Kenya on Saturday . The account of the . roof collapse raises the possibility that the military may have caused . the death of hostages in its rescue attempt. An undisclosed number of . people are feared to be buried in the rubble. The official said post-mortem . examinations would be conducted on any bodies found - from the militants . or the structural collapse. The . official also said Kenyan troops fired rocket-propelled grenades inside . the mall, but would not say what caused the floors to collapse, if the . action was intentional, or if it was an accident. The . account at least partially backs up information given on Wednesday by . another official who said RPGs fired by soldiers created a gaping hole . in the mall's roof and caused the floors to collapse. Devastation: The collapsed upper car park of the Westgate mall in Nairobi . Four huge explosions rocked the mall on Monday and dark smoke poured out - the likely time that the floors collapsed. The government has not said publicly . what caused the collapse. One official had earlier suggested it was . caused by a mattress fire in the Nakumatt department store. Presidential . spokesman Manoah Esipisu said structural engineers were examining the . collapse. FBI agents, along with investigators from Britain, Canada and . Germany, are taking part in the inquiry. Results are not expected until next week at the earliest. Protest: Somali women listen to a speaker at a solidarity rally to denounce al Shabaab's attack of a shopping mall in Nairobi, in Minneapolis, Minnesota . The Daily Nation newspaper reported that the initial counter-attack against Al-shabab was made by the police and local vigilante groups, who managed to corner the terrorists. But further progress was hampered by the police commander being accidentally shot dead by troops, who arrived on the scene shortly afterwards. Police are trying to determine if the attackers stored ammunition in the mall hours or even days before the attack, and investigators are tracing the ownership of a car that has been discovered and is believed to have been used by the gunmen. Al-Shabab said it carried out last Saturday's attack to punish Kenya for sending its troops into Somalia to fight the al Qaida-linked militant group that had seized large parts of that country for years before being dislodged from the capital Mogadishu. Eight suspects are being held over the attack, interior minister Joseph Ole Lenku said. Three others who had been detained were released. The government says at least 61 civilians and six security forces were killed. At least five attackers were also killed. Under siege: Heavy smoke rises from the Westgate mall in Nairobi on Monday September 23 . At the request of Kenya, Interpol issued a notice asking for help in capturing 29-year-old British-born fugitive Samantha Lewthwaite - not in connection with the mall attack, but over a 2011 plot to bomb holiday resorts in Kenya. Known as ‘the white widow’, she was married to one of the suicide bombers in the July 7 2005 attack on London's transport system, and there is speculation that she was involved in the mall attack. But Mr Lenku suggested that Interpol raised the issue of the international alert. He declined to discuss any links to the mall attack, saying he ‘wouldn't want to pre-empt the position of the forensic investigation taking place’. Kenyan officials have offered at times contradictory accounts of the siege and are reluctant to release many details of the investigation prematurely. Mr Lenku urged patience, saying the investigation is ‘a very delicate and complex operation that requires time’. He said no bodies had been recovered from the rubble and no official reports of missing persons had been filed. The Kenyan Red Cross has said 59 people are unaccounted for, raising fears of bodies in the debris. The possibility that government troops were behind the roof collapse only added to the frustrations of Kenyans questioning what happened at the mall. ‘You have to blame the government, not the soldiers, because they had to get their orders from somewhere,’ said John Odera, a security guard. ‘They should be held responsible for what they did.’ A user-generated list of more than 80 questions on social media includes ‘How many terrorists were involved in the attack?’, ‘Are any terrorists loose in the city?’, ‘Can we see the bodies of the 'neutralised' terrorists?’ and ‘Are we still safe?’","The video shows seriously wounded people wailing and calling out for help .

"No campaigners last night lit up three of Scotland's most famous tourist attractions with a clear message about which way the electorate should vote today. A large No was projected onto Edinburgh Castle, Stirling Castle and the Armadillo in Glasgow in an audacious last-minute public relations stroke. The 50 foot high message was shone on the rocky outcrop below Edinburgh castle around 10pm as the people of Scotland deliberate the future of the United Kingdom. Scroll down for video . Pro Union campaigners projected a large No onto the hill below Edinburgh Castle late last night . A similar light display was shone on the side of Stirling Castle by anti-independence campaigners . Even in Glasgow, members of the no campaign managed to shine their message on the Armadillo . Last night, nobody from the Labour Party or the Better Together Campaign was in a position to confirm whether they were responsible for the publicity stunt. Labour leader Ed Miliband posted an image of the Edinburgh Castle display on his Twitter feed which was retweeted more than 500 times within three hours of his message. One source said: 'I don't want to say too much about it. I can't tell you who was behind the show as they do not want that information getting out.' The concept is called Projection Bombing where a powerful light beam - sometimes featuring lasers is broadcast on an iconic building or structure. It can also be used in guerrilla advertising campaigns although the legality of the stunts has been questioned. In October 2010 Westminster Council threatened legal action against Cricket Australia who beamed a message on the side of Big Ben taunting the England cricket team.

"People who are prone to suffering migraines in middle age are more than twice as likely to develop Parkinson's disease, a new study has found. Those who suffer early warning signs, known as migraine aura, which include seeing flashing lights, were found to be most at risk, scientists have said. The link is thought to be associated with a dysfunction in the brain messenger dopamine, but researchers stressed the risk is still low. NHS figures show around one in every five women, and one in every 15 men suffer migraines, which usually begin in early adulthood. People who suffer migraines in middle age are more than twice as likely to develop Parkinson's disease, a new study by the Uniformed Services University of Bethesda has found . Yet the exact cause of migraines is unknown. They are thought to be the result of temporary changes in the chemicals and blood vessels in the brain. Around half of all people who experience migraines also have a close relative with the condition, suggesting that genes may play a role. Dr Ann Scher of the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda said: 'Migraine is the most common brain disorder in both men and women. 'It has been linked in other studies to cerebrovascular and heart disease. 'This new possible association is one more reason research is needed to understand, prevent and treat the condition. 'A dysfunction in the brain messenger dopamine is common to both Parkinson's and restless legs syndrome (RLS), and has been hypothesised as a possible cause of migraine for many years. 'Symptoms of migraine such as excessive yawning, nausea and vomiting are thought to be related to dopamine receptor stimulation. 'More research should focus on exploring this possible link through genetic studies. 'While the history of migraine is associated with an increased risk for Parkinson's, that risk is still quite low.' The study published online in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, examined 5,620 people aged between 33 and 65 over a 25-year period. At the start of the study, 3,924 had no headaches, 1,028 had headaches with no migraine symptoms, 238 had migraine with no aura and 430 had migraine with aura. As the study progressed the participants were assessed for any symptoms of Parkinson's, been diagnosed with Parkinson's or had symptoms of RLS - also known as Willis-Ekbom disease. The study, published in Neurology, found those with migraine aura - where a sufferer experiences early warning signs, like flashing lights - are 3.6 times more likely to suffer Parkinson's, pictured on an MRI scan . A total of 2.4 per cent of those with migraine with aura had the disease, compared to 1.1 per cent of those with no headaches. People with migraine with aura were 3.6 times more likely to report at least four of six  symptoms of Parkinson's, while those with migraine with no aura had 2.3 times the odds of these symptoms. Overall, 19.7 per cent of those with migraine with aura had symptoms, compared to 12.6 per cent of those with migraine with no aura and 7.5 per cent of those with no headaches. Women with migraine with aura were also more likely to have a family history of Parkinson's disease compared to those with no headaches. Professor David Burn, Parkinson’s UK Clinical Director, said: 'People who suffer from migraines should not be concerned by this new research. 'Although the results suggest that migraines could double your risk of Parkinson’s in later life, this risk is still very low. 'We’ve known for a while there is a small link between migraine and Parkinson’s. If further research confirms this then migraine could be included as one of a number of early-warning symptoms used to identify people at higher risk of developing Parkinson’s.'","Those who suffer migraine aura - early warning signs - are most at risk .

"Roberto Martinez has embraced Everton’s return to Europe and made it his aim to ensure this is the start of prolonged spell on the big stage. It is five years since Everton last played in the Europa League - they were knocked out by Sporting Lisbon in February 2010 - but, unlike some managers, Martinez is relishing the prospects of having a Thursday-Sunday schedule for the first half of the campaign. Martinez sees European football as being crucial to the development of his squad and while he believes they face a ‘phenomenal challenge’ against Wolfsburg at Goodison Park on Thursday evening, he is confident they can handle the demands. Everton boss Roberto Martinez wants the club to be playing in Europe for many seasons to come . Reaching the knockout stages is a prime objective for Martinez but he is also looking at the bigger picture. Everton had a spell of qualifying for Europe four times in five seasons under David Moyes but, prior to that, there had only been one campaign since the 1980s. That is why Martinez believes it is essential Everton maintain their place in the Barclays Premier League’s top six so that nights like the one that beckons against Wolfsburg are not something out of the ordinary. ‘Our fans know we are not going to stand still,’ said Martinez. ’We are trying to be successful today but having a clear target of where we want to get to. We want to be a football club that replicates the glories in the past. Everton have been training ahead of their Europa League group opener at home to Wolfsburg on Thursday . ‘That doesn’t just happen on the pitch there are a lot of aspects which need to come together. On the pitch and the mentality you develop we want to put the demand on being in Europe every season that is a goal. ‘It is not easy because there are another eight or nine teams in the Premier League who have the same mentality and are spending money to achieve that. The competition is there for that, but we want to get back to how it was in the 60s and 80s here in the years ahead. ‘I get satisfaction from how good we can be as a team and part of that process is how good we can be in Europe. We need Europe for us to be as good as we can be. The potential in the squad is incredible. The next step is to be facing European sides and that is what we need to progress.’ Everton captain Phil Jagielka admits he would like to three cups with the club before he retires . Phil Jagielka, Everton’s captain, has bittersweet memories of Everton’s last European campaign, as he made his return from a cruciate ligament problem in their final game against Sporting Lisbon. He has experienced highs and lows in the Europa League but he has missed being out of it. ‘I’ve just turned 32, so the number of times I’m going to get into cup competitions is drastically coming down,’ he said. ‘I’m desperate to finish as high up as we can in the Premier League and also win a cup, two cups or three cups. These are the competitions you go into. ‘You tune into the latter stages of the Europa League and you see the teams involved, why would you not want to be one of those teams? We’re desperate to do as well as we can. We put a lot of faith in the manager picking the right team. We have full confidence in him.","Everton host Wolfsburg in their opening Europa League group game .

"'Jihadi John', the ISIS terrorist believed to be from England, may have been on drugs or suffering from stress when he beheaded British hostage David Haines. A scientific analysis of his speech in the video that shocked the world has raised the possibility that the killer was on khat - an illegal class C herbal stimulant popular among the Somali community in the UK - or amphetamines when the video was recorded. He speaks slower and at a slightly higher pitch than he does in the earlier footage when he kills two American hostages, according to an audio analyst. He also has an accent from the south-west of England. Scroll down for video . 'Jihadi John', the ISIS terrorist believed to be from England, may have been on drugs or suffering stress when he beheaded British hostage David Haines, it has been revealed . Khat is used by jihadists in Yemen and Somalia and there is evidence to suggest ISIS fighters take speed to heighten their combat skills and stave off exhaustion. The audio expert told The Times that the man's 'distinctive speech patterns' could indicate he is on khat. He added: 'It was not possible to establish whether some of these factors derived from rote learning (the speech) or whether there were other physiological or psychological factors involved.' The Haines video also features a second male voice who either says 'Danny' or 'damn him' and the analysis also indicates it was edited and produced by someone other than the person who did the murders of the two Americans, James Foley and Steven Sotloff. The killer's 'distinctive speech patterns' could indicate he is on khat, an illegal class C herbal stimulant popular among the Somali community in the UK and jihadis in Yemen .

Alan Henning, from Eccles, Salford, could be the ISISexecutioner's next victim. He was snatched by brutal  militants while attempting to deliver aid in Syria. The 47-year-old  was seen in a more recent video, where 'Jihadi John' was threatening to behead the aid worker. On Tuesday it emerged that IS were 'tipped off' about his aid mission to Syria and seized him just half an hour after he entered the country. Security services are now investigating whether IS fighters were tipped off about the convoy by corrupt local officials or an insider after it emerged the British taxi driver was seized just 30 minutes after he entered Syria. Alan Henning (circled), from Eccles, Salford, could be the ISIS executioner's next victim. He was snatched by brutal militants while attempting to deliver aid in Syria. The British aid worker was just four miles from the Turkish border when he was taken after militants were reportedly made aware of his arrival. Muslim aid worker Pervez Abdullah Rafiq, who travelled with Mr Henning on previous trips to deliver aid to Syria, yesterday issued a video plea to the leader of Islamic State to release him. In the video Mr Rafiq says: 'Your prisoner Alan Henning travelled with us several times to Syria. On all occasions, we your Muslim brothers, brought him with us under our care and protection.' He pleads that Mr Henning should not pay 'for the crimes that international governments have committed' with his life. Mr Rafiq recalls how Alan Henning devoted 'all his free time' to raising awareness of the suffering of Syrian children and washed cars to raise money for them. He also describes how Mr Henning chose to sleep in the van on the journey to Syria rather than pay for a hotel, to avoid spending money that would otherwise go to the people of Syria.","Vocal expert says killer's speech pattern could be affected by stimulant khat .

"Edinson Cavani is intent on leaving Paris Saint-Germain in a move that will invite an offer from Manchester United in the summer. According to sources at the club, the Uruguay striker is unhappy with his role at the club - particularly because of the system favoured by Laurent Blanc.

As previously reported by Sportsmail, PSG will not entertain the idea of selling him this month, but the thought of capturing one of Europe’s most accomplished finishers for next season must appeal to United manager David Moyes.

"It's been at the forefront of British politics for months. And last night the issue of Scottish Independence weighed heavy on the hearts of British TV stars too, as the nation's favourite actors lined up  for the premiere of the latest series of Downton Abbey.

Jim Carter, known to many as the grumpy butler Carson, refused to comment as an Englishman but said he hoped 'they all' vote (in Scotland) Their comments come as polling stations across Scotland prepare to open in a matter of hours. The programme's creator, Julian Fellowes, said: 'I would be sorry to see the union lost.' 'But I feel quite strongly this is a matter for the people of Scotland and, you know, we keep harrying them from down here and telling them what they can't have if they vote this way and so on. 'I think we should leave them alone to come to their decision. You know, I wish at the beginning we'd said we will discuss all the terms if and when you vote for independence, we hope you don't.' Lesley Nicol, who plays Mrs Patmore the cook, was less sure on the matter. 'I don't know. If I was Scottish, I'm half Scottish, but I'm not fully Scottish so I think it's very different if you live up there so I don't think I'm the person to comment on it.'

"Esme Smith has refused to answer police questions after she was found in North London 11 days after going missing . A 14-year-old schoolgirl who went missing for 11 days is refusing to speak to police after she was found safe earlier this week. Esme Smith, from Farnham, Surrey, was spotted in North London after a member of the public recognised her from media reports about her disappearance. She had not been seen since 11 days previously when she left school with friends. She told them she was travelling to nearby Woking but instead got on a train to London's Waterloo station, where she was caught on CCTV. She has now been interviewed by officers but has not answered questions as to her whereabouts or who she has been with, a Surrey Police spokesman has said. The spokesman said she has also not returned home to her parents Nato commander Mark, 50, and Dinah, 39. The force has said there have been no allegations of any criminal activity and there is no evidence Esme has been groomed. CCTV images of the teenager at Waterloo show she had changed out of her school uniform and into a white flowery dress. She was also wearing a blue denim jacket and was carrying a black school bag and black floral bag with chain straps. Her 19-year-old sister Sian last week made an emotional appeal to the missing girl, saying: ‘Esme, if you are reading this, I just want to say please come home or at least get in touch so that we know that you are safe. ‘We are all really worried about you and we just want to make sure you are OK. You are not in any trouble so please just get in touch.’ Scroll down for video . Esme was discovered in London after going missing from her home in Surrey . More than 4,000 people had 'liked' a Facebook page called Find Esme Smith, dedicated to raising awareness of the girl's disappearance. Her father Mark Smith, who works at Nato’s Joint Warfare Centre in Norway, said he was 'worried sick' about his teenage daughter. Esme is a pupil at All Hallows Catholic School in Farnham, where she was last seen by friends at the end of the school day on September 12. After she was found, Detective Superintendent Jon Savell thanked the public and the media for their assistance in helping to find Esme.

"A few words in Spanish, a quick kiss of the badge and Gareth Bale had sidestepped the first challenge of his new life as the world’s most expensive footballer. What a day it was for Bale. It did feel slightly surreal, he confessed, to find himself juggling a football in the sunshine before an estimated 30,000 Real Madrid fans. Like a prisoner released from nearly 100 days of transfer talks he emerged blinking and testing his limbs to see if they still did what they did before. Scroll down for videos of Bale's grand unveiling at the Bernabeu. Grand ceremony: Gareth Bale performed kick-ups in the centre circle in front of an adoring crowd . Kissing the badge: Bale wasted no time in showing his affection for his new club at the Bernabeu . The . Madridistas had flocked to the Bernabeu Stadium to witness the official . unveiling of their newest Galactico, the man who had cost £86million, . more than Cristiano Ronaldo. What . on earth would such a footballer look like? Well, he looked clean-cut . in his skinny black suit and pencil-thin black tie, brimming with . emotion as he was introduced by Real president Florentino Perez. After . one of at least four costume changes, he appeared truly proud to step . on to the pitch in the pristine white kit of his new team and his bright . yellow adidas boots. The . keepy-uppies, to be honest, left a little to be desired — ‘I was very . nervous,’ he said — but the football comes later. Real fans will soon . appreciate what Bale the footballer does well and it isn’t keepy-uppies. It's all kicking off: Bale boots footballs into the crowd during his unveiling . Family affair: Bale's relatives join in with proceedings inside the stadium on Monday afternoon . Yesterday, the skill of the boy from Cardiff was to sprinkle some of his humble charm upon his new followers. He . didn’t venture far into his new language but far enough to make an . impression. In Spanish, Bale said: ‘Hello, this is a dream. Thank you . for this great welcome. Hala Madrid.’ His . ‘Hail Madrid’ finish was particularly well received, his beaming smile . was effortless and he seemed happier when asked to drop kick footballs . into the steep tiers of the stands or lash the ball into an empty goal . to oblige photographers. When he pulled up the front of his shirt and . gave the Real crest a smacker, it drew the biggest cheer of the day. ‘Gar-eth . Bailey, Gar-eth Bailey, Gar-eth Bailey,’ the fans chanted. They briefly . sang the names of Mesut Ozil — the  playmaker on his way to Arsenal . after the arrival of Bale — and Iker Casillas — the out-of-favour . goalkeeping legend. But generally the event was on message. Pitching in: Bale's family join him on the Bernabeu playing surface .

FIRST EL CLASICO . v Barcelona (A) - October 27 . At . times, it felt like a celebrity wedding as the dignitaries breezed in . to take their seats with nods and smiles. They faced the stage erected . last week in the hope Daniel Levy may be convinced to speed Tottenham’s . side of things up slightly. Television . screens showed re-runs of Bale’s devastating displays for Spurs against . Inter Milan, the Champions League ties which launched the Welshman into . a different orbit in 2010. The . Real Madrid board arrived, suited and serious behind shades. Among . their number were former players Emilio Butragueno and Fernando Redondo. Then . came Bale’s family, including his parents and his childhood sweetheart, . Emma Rhys-Jones, with their 11-month-old daughter Alba Violet. Pitch perfect: The £86million Welshman poses for the media and supporters during his Bernabeu presentation . His agents, team Stellar, managed admirably to contain their delight at pushing this one over the line. Bale . appeared fashionably late to a round of applause and a sigh of relief . that Levy had not reappeared brandishing the small print and demanding a . few euros more. Negotiations . were ‘intense’ and ‘complex’, said Perez with diplomacy, and Bale, when . asked, neatly swerved the question about the Tottenham question. All in . the past, he insisted. In the present, Bale pulled on a set of cheap . headphones to listen to the translation as Perez took the stage before . two giant photographs. One . showed Bale in action for Wales, the other of him as a boy, aged about . 12, wearing a Real Madrid shirt from the Steve McManaman era and making a . peace symbol with two fingers. Here . was the centre point of the script. Bale supported Real Madrid as a . boy. Not quite Real duvets and curtains in South Wales but he slept in . this shirt and dreamed of playing for them. Welcome to Madrid: Gareth Bale arrives in the stands to a rapturuous applause from the Madrid supporters . The only way is up: Bale is joining the stars at the Bernabeu . Gareth Bale to get more goals than Cristiano Ronaldo in La Liga this season - 10/1 . Total La Liga Goals - Over 16.5: 5/6; Under 16.5: 5/6 . He . referred repeatedly to them as the biggest club in the world, noted . their nine European titles and called Cristiano Ronaldo the best player . in the world, airbrushing Lionel Messi from the picture for effect. This . was not lost on his audience. When Neymar arrived at Barcelona earlier . this summer, he had done precisely the same in reverse; hailing Messi . and ignoring Ronaldo. That’s all part of the politics where these two rivals are concerned. Everyone . took care to tiptoe around the world-record transfer fee. It is . advertised as £78m by Real rather than £86m to satisfy Ronaldo’s ego. Again, . it’s all part of the politics and, if Bale was still in any doubt that . he was embarking on an adventure into a different dimension, then . Perez gave it to him straight. Madrid magician: Gareth Bale shows off his silky skills to the Real fans in the Bernabeu . ‘You . are now in the most demanding club in the world but we will always be . by your side,’ said Perez. ‘Challenges are constant, even after victory, . but never forget the energy of this stadium will be your ally. Many . great players have played here and you will be one of their heirs. ‘Gareth . Bale, this is your stadium, this is your shirt, this is your pitch and . these are your fans. From now on this is your home. ‘Welcome to your team. Welcome to Real Madrid.’ Bale . gulped. Who can blame him? It is a long way from the Cardiff Civil . Service Under Nines — or Southampton’s Academy for that matter. It . is a big step from Tottenham, too, for a 24-year-old. Luka Modric . needed time to adjust and he did not carry the label of the world’s most . expensive footballer. Adoring fans: Gareth Bale walked around the perimeter of the pitch kicking balls into the crowd . Selling point: There are plenty of Bale shirts on sale in the Madrid club shop . From . the moment of his debut, expected to be away at Villarreal a week on . Sunday, Bale will stand direct comparison to Ronaldo and the Barcelona . pair of Messi and Neymar. The . next time he steps out in public on to the Bernabeu turf, against . Getafe a week later, he will be judged by these people as a footballer. Not . only that, he will be judged as the world’s most expensive . footballer; someone who banks £12m a year. Nerves will not be an amusing . excuse. He will not be . Gareth Bale the polite, well-mannered and self-effacing homeboy from . Cardiff, prepared to risk a few words of Spanish in a public arena. He . will be Gareth Bale the Galactico, expected to win the Champions League. Wish him well. All hail Bale: The Madridistas go wild at their new star's unveiling .

"Paris St Germain striker Edinson Cavani has insisted he is happy at the club despite reports suggesting he had asked to leave this summer. The 27-year-old Uruguayan moved to Paris from Napoli last summer in a huge deal worth a reported £55million, but was said to be unhappy at playing second fiddle to Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the French capital. He has been linked with a number of clubs, including Manchester United, but has said he plans to remain with PSG. Happy to stay: Edinson Cavani says he has no issues with Paris St Germain . 'I am sure to stay, why would I not?' he told L'Equipe while with PSG in Beijing on Thursday morning. 'I'm well in Paris. I have a contract to honour. I'm calm, I'd rather be here. I feel good here. However, I know it does not depend solely on the player but also on the club.' Cavani finished his first season as both a Ligue 1 champion and a Coupe de la Ligue winner. He scored both goals in the cup final, 2-1 win over Lyon, but throughout the season often found himself playing out wide - supposedly leading to his unhappiness at the club. Good season: Cavani helped PSG win the title in France . However, Cavani added that he had been reassured about his role in Laurent Blanc's side. 'There were some small issues about the position I wanted to play but I feel very good about that now,' he said. 'I waited for the right moment to speak. It is important for a striker to play in a position that is natural for him. Everyone knows my position and we do not need to talk about this.'","Edison Cavani says he is happy at French club .

"Jamie Donaldson emerges from a side door of his home in the Cheshire countryside cradling baby daughter Isla, as two-year-old son Max searches the kitchen for a tape measure to record the height of the breakfast bar. If anyone can be presented as proof of the existence of the ‘nappy factor’ — a term introduced by betting guru Keith Elliott to suggest having babies, particularly boys, makes a better golfer — it is Donaldson. ‘It’s played a big part. I didn’t win a tournament until I had a child and now I’ve won three so I suppose I’d better have some more kids,’ he says. ‘I didn’t want them to grow up saying: “My dad was a professional golfer but he didn’t win any tournaments”.’ Jamie Donaldson at home in Cheshire with his family, wife Kat son Max and daughter Esla . Jamie Donaldson secured his Ryder Cup place by winning the penultimate counting event, the Czech Masters . It was no coincidence, thinks Donaldson, that his breakthrough tour victory at the Irish Open in 2012, after trying for 12 years and 255 events, came just three months after Max’s birth. On Thursday, Donaldson will tee it up in the Wales Open but next week he makes his debut for Europe in the Ryder Cup. His rise has been called a ‘Cinderella story’. Over the past five years he has advanced from a top-100 performer into one of Europe’s best, securing a place at Gleneagles by right. Not bad for a man who has been forced to contemplate ‘getting a proper job’ on several occasions due to a back injury he believes was caused by practising too much. ‘It got so bad I was scared of bending down to pick up my ball,’ says Donaldson. ‘If I trod on a pothole in the course I thought that would be it. Every other week I’d be having a problem, it was horrific, I thought I was finished.’ In 2006, he found himself plying his wares in the backwaters of the Challenge Tour. In stark contrast to the £2million he has earned this year in prize-money, Donaldson was scraping by. ‘I was in the wilderness,’ he says, ‘not really earning enough to keep myself, let alone a family. That was the biggest eye-opener for me. After two events on the Challenge Tour I was staring in the face getting a real job and I really didn’t like that prospect. Jamie Donaldson poses for a photograph with his family ahead of the Ryder Cup campaign . Jamie Donaldson's rise is proof at the existence of a 'nappy factor' ‘I was playing rubbish and stayed in terrible B&Bs, accommodation that wasn’t clean. But my attitude was that providing you’ve got a bed to sleep on and it’s not too cold, it didn’t matter. I don’t mind roughing it. When I was a kid we used to go to watch The Open and sleep in the back of a Ford Fiesta where it was Baltic at night just to see Seve Ballesteros or Nick Faldo play.’ We are sitting in a house — designed by Donaldson’s wife Kat, an international business and Spanish graduate — which overlooks rolling farmland. Smart but not flash, it is just outside the upmarket village of Prestbury. Michael Carrick lives round the corner, Wayne Rooney in the next village. The material gains are clear to see but they have not come without hard work. Success on the biggest stage has come relatively late to Donaldson. At 38, he is the fourth oldest on Europe’s Ryder Cup team but one of only three who have not played in it before. ‘I still consider myself young in golfing terms because I started late,’ he says. Where Tiger Woods was celebrated on the front of golf magazines at five and Rory McIlroy was hitting 40-yard drives aged two, Donaldson did not play properly until he was 12 and was arguably not even the best in his own family. Jamie Donaldson plays a shot during the third round of the Omega European Masters at Crans-sur-Sierre . Jamie Donaldson will tee it up in the Wales Open but next week he makes his debut for Europe . ‘I have a bit of banter with my brother,’ says Donaldson. ‘He won the junior matchplay at our club in Macclesfield and I never did. I was bloody awful. ‘I’m a massive Liverpool fan and played football until I was 15 but decided I wanted to be a pro golfer and I’d practise until the cows came home. I’d hit down the fairways of the par-fiv. Members would hit their balls between yours and you’d have 100 balls in the same place. They hated it but I’d do it all day. ‘I used to practise on my own. When you leave school at 16 without qualifications you’d better like practising on your own because if you don’t, you’re toast.’ Donald was born in Pontypridd to a Welsh mother and Liverpudlian father, Jim, who acted as a taxi driver in the early days. ‘He’d drive me the length of the country to tournaments and lessons,’ says Donaldson. ‘He used to caddie for me but I sacked him. I duffed a chip and he said, “what you done that for?” and I said, “Dad, how far’s the clubhouse?” It was about a mile, so I said, “See you then”.’ It was hard to get Donaldson off the practice ground, but he is barely on it now and has not been to the gym since 2007. He stays fit by mountain and road biking. Jamie Donaldson has not been to a gym since 2007 and stays fit by mountain and road biking . Jamie Donaldson’s wife, Kat, an international business and Spanish graduate . ‘My body feels as strong as it ever has,’ he says. Occasionally, Donaldson thinks about what it will feel like to be on the first tee at Gleneagles. Darren Clarke said it is the most nervous you feel as a golfer. ‘The more nervous you are, the better you play sometimes,’ says Donaldson. ‘In the last round at the Irish Open I hit the best shot I ever had off the first tee and never looked back. It is a dream come true to play in the Ryder Cup, but there’s still plenty of fuel in the fire. I’m not thinking that’ll be me all out.

"TV detective: John Nettles, pictured filming Bergerac in Jersey, was sent hate mail after appearing in a documentary about the occupation of the island . Bergerac star John Nettles seemed the perfect choice to present a documentary on the history of Jersey after spending many years filming scenes for the hit TV series on the idyllic island. But the actor, who is still well remembered for playing the TV detective for a decade from 1981, has revealed how he was outcast by his friends for being involved in the three-part expose about the Nazi occupation of Jersey during the Second World War. At the time Nettles had no idea that the show would receive such a hostile reception from the islanders and thought it would be an interesting chance to learn more about the island he had spent so much time in. But shortly after the show was aired he found himself being ostracised by former friends on the island and the recipient of threatening letters and hate mail. He told the Daily Express: 'The islanders didn't like the way we talked about the resistance, didn't like the way we talked about the collaboration or allegations of it and they didn't like the way we talked about the treatment of the Jews by the administration of the islands.' Despite the animosity caused by the Channel Islands at War documentary, it inspired Nettles to continue researching the subject and he is now releasing a book that goes into the Nazi occupation of Jersey in more detail. Nettles, now 69, knew that many would be unhappy about the project, but decided the story needed to be told. Scroll down for video . Dark history: Residents were left to fend for themselves after Winston Churchill decided the Channel Islands were too difficult to defend. Reminders of the occupation, such as this German fortification, can still be seen on Jersey . Sensitive subject: This German underground hospital in Jersey is just one of many historical landmarks that demonstrate the strength of the occupying force on the island . He said: 'There came a point when I thought, either I don't tell this story and keep my friends or I tell it and lose them all.' The Channel Islands - comprising of Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney, Sark and Herm - were the only part of Britain ever to fall under Nazi rule during the Second World War. Winston Churchill felt the islands were impossible to defend and many residents were forced to flee to mainland Britain. Those who remained were left to fend for themselves under a strict German regime with Jersey occupied from July 1, 1940, until May 9, 1945. Many were left completely isolated with limited rations and no way of escape. Invaders: German soldiers with a 25-ton Char B tank used during the occupation of Jersey in the Second World War . Nettles said: 'It is the story of a sustained and wholesale attack on human values, of great suffering, venality and violence.' But some islanders fared better than others during the occupation with Nettles noting that the Dame of Sark, Sybil Hathaway, invited invading German officers to a lobster dinner. This was one of many examples later investigated by the British government as possible collaboration with the Nazis. Nettles points out that many were left with little choice but to obey the Nazi occupiers as they had no way of escaping and hardly any weapons. Backlash: John Nettles said he received hate mail over his claims in the TV documentary The Channel Islands at War . But their co-operation in producing a list of residents and details of their birth aided the Germans in identifying Jewish residents who were then transported to concentration camps. Nettles added: 'The Jewish question in the Channel Islands is one of the most difficult to address.

"With just 16 more sleeps until the Barclays Premier League season kicks off, excitement is building as we eagerly await the new campaign. For now, we make do with the warm-up matches, offering glimpses of what we can expect to see in just over two weeks time. Some stars are already shining bright, scoring goals and frightening defences. Apologies in advance if it is all a deception, but here are the five players that Sportsmail expect to take the Premier League by storm this time around. VIDEO Scroll down for pre-season highlights . New man: Chelsea's £32million signing Diego Costa has begun his career with Jose Mourinho's side in style . Phil Jones (Manchester United) The 22-year-old has suffered from his own versatility and enthusiasm for the team ethic in recent times, often being deployed at right back or central midfield. In truth, these positions do not do justice to an English centre half of giant potential. Sir Alex Ferguson bought him as a centre-back and intended to mould him in that position. As it transpired, three seasons on, Jones has started only 16 times at the heart of the United defence. Under Louis van Gaal's new 3-5-2 system, Jones is assured a place as part of the back three and now faces a major test of his credential. So far, so good though - United have not conceded in pre-season when Jones has been on the pitch. Rock solid: Manchester United are yet to concede a goal in pre-season with Phil Jones (left) on the pitch . Erik Lamela (Tottenham) The marquee signing to replace Gareth Bale, considered one of the finest young talents in the world game, but he endured a traumatic first campaign with Spurs. Lamela's only 90 mutes in the Premier League came in the 6-0 thrashing by Manchester City at The Etihad Stadium and he did not appear in a Tottenham shirt following the turn of the year. The Argentine, who struggled with injuries in the second half of the season, is desperate to turn things round and prove himself in the Premier League. He scored twice in the victory over Toronto and manager Mauricio Pochettino has been speaking positively of Lamela's attitude and quality - but they will both know that sterner tests await upon their return to England. Finding his feet: Tottenham forward Erik Lamela has shone glimpses of his ability during Spurs' US tour . VIDEO Seattle Sounders v Spurs highlights . Raheem Sterling (Liverpool) One of the few England players to emerge from the World Cup with their reputation enhanced, Sterling has picked up from where he left off last season. A goal against Manchester City capped a fine performance and with Luis Suarez gone and Liverpool looking a touch light in the forward positions, there is an opportunity for Sterling to emerge as Liverpool's talisman, dribbling with confidence, committing opponents and taking responsibility. If he remains fit, he could double last season's return of 10 goals. Danger man: Liverpool's Raheem Sterling slots the ball beyond Manchester City keeper Joe Hart . VIDEO Liverpool v Manchester City highlights . Stevan Jovetic (Manchester City) Four goals in two games against AC Milan and Liverpool in the USA is almost as many as the six that Jovetic managed in the whole of last season. Clearly, Jovetic is a man on a mission, determined to revive his Manchester City career after a first season punctuated by muscle injuries and frequent setbacks, as the Serbian started only two Premier League games. In his previous life in Italy, he was compared to Gianfranco Zola and Roberto Baggio, and it is telling that Manuel Pellegrini, despite his frustrations with Jovetic last season, would not countenance selling him to Inter Milan this summer. City believe they have one of the planet's most inventive forwards on their hands and with Alvaro Negredo injured, he will be handed the chance to battle with Edin Dzeko for a place alongside the brilliant Sergio Aguero. Goal-getter: Stevan Jovetic flicks the ball past Simon Mignolet to score for Manchester City . Diego Costa (Chelsea) The brawny frontman has made an instant impact in a Chelsea shirt, opening his account against Olimpija Ljubijana and then laying on assists for Mohamed Salah and Nemanja Matic in the victory over Vitesse Arnhem on Wednesday evening. Thirty-five goals for Atletico Madrid last season and Costa looks set to shatter the narrative of the Roman Abramovich years, where big name strikers such as Mateja Kezman, Andriy Shevchenko, Hernan Crespo and Fernando Torres have all failed to shine in the blue shirt. Perfect start: Diego Costa netted his first goal for Chelsea in their 2-1 win against Olimpija Ljubljana .","Sterling scored in normal time as Liverpool beat Manchester City on penalties in New York .
Spurs forward Lamela netted twice against Toronto and looks to be finding his form ahead of the new season .

"Bodies started to drop at Franklin’s Gardens but the resolve of the champions ultimately proved too much for Bath as Northampton held on for a dramatic win. No-one steps up for the Saints more than Dylan Hartley and it was the skipper who emerged from a pile of bodies to deny the West Country side a last-ditch try. Bath arrived in the Midlands with sharpened claws. Confidence was high after last week’s 45-0 victory over Leicester, but here they met their match as the Saints’ defence galvanised for a bonus point win. Northampton full back Ben Foden makes a break in their win over Bath at Franklin's Gardens . Saints prop Dylan Hartley battles Bath's James Craig during their Aviva Premiership win on Saturday . ‘It’s not always about scoring loads of tries like we did against Gloucester,’ said Hartley. ‘It’s about defending like we did today. I’m really proud of the guys.’ Saints had to face the league’s in-form side without Tom Wood and Courtney Lawes, who were late injury withdrawals for the hosts. The pair would have been watched closely by England coaches Andy Farrell and Graham Rowntree, who were in the stands for the sell-out match, but there was still no shortage of duels to drool over. Bath won a penalty at the opening scrum after England prop Alex Corbisiero, perhaps harshly, was penalised as he packed down against international team-mate David Wilson. But Saints quickly settled into their rhythm and, after a kick from George Ford, Ben Foden scythed through the Bath defence, before Luke Arscott slapped down a Kahn Fotuali’i try to gift the hosts a penalty try. The Bath full-back was sin-binned for his troubles and Stephen Myler converted. Calum Clarke doubled the lead after 15 minutes. George Pisi had defenders swinging from his ankles as he burst through the middle, before Luther Burrell’s floated pass sent his team-mate over in the corner. Myler again converted. Bath's Chris Cook kicks clear as Saints' Kahn Fotuali'i attempts to charge it down . Bath did not give up hope. With Arscott back on the pitch, Ford began to orchestrate his side’s attack and, not before confirmation from the TMO, the England playmaker sent Wilson over with an inside pass. Ford converted and then exchanged a penalty with Myler, before the Saints No10 missed an attempt on goal to leave the visitors trailing by seven points at the break. ‘We’ve sometimes blown teams away in the first 20 minutes, but it turned around today,’ said Bath head coach Mike Ford. ‘Arscott was in the bin after 14 minutes and 14 points down after 15 minutes it is a tough place to come back from. Going in at 17-10, I thought we could do some damage.’ England prop Alex Corbisiero is treated for an injury by Saints' physiotherapists . Olly Woodburn crosses for Bath's second five-pointer in their first defeat of the season . Foden continued to impress as he set up Christian Day for Northampton’s third try after 49 minutes. Jon Fisher made the hard yards, before Foden set up Day. The momentum continued as the bonus point was secured four minutes later. Ford’s kick went into Northampton hands and the hosts countered. The ball was spun from right to left before Burrell and North combined, allowing Pisi to power through two tackles for a try. Bath sent on Gavin Henson and he sent over Olly Woodburn, before Nick Auterac touched down off the back of a driving maul to narrow the deficit. But the late push came to nothing, as Hartley rallied his troops.

"Landmark ruling: President of the Family Division Sir James Munby . Decisions by secret courts that can lead to children being taken from their parents or old people forced into care homes are finally to be opened up to public scrutiny. Under rules set out yesterday, future judgments in the family courts and the Court of Protection must be made public except in cases where there is a clear reason to dictate they should not be. Councils applying to take children into care or to take control of the lives of the old and sick can no longer hide behind a cloak of anonymity. Expert witnesses, including social workers, should also be named in public, as should anyone found responsible for wrongdoing. The . landmark changes break a silence that has surrounded family justice for . nearly 100 years. They also mark a major victory for the Daily Mail . which has campaigned against secret courts and exposed a series of major . scandals over the past year resulting from justice being conducted . behind closed doors. The . new rules, laid down by the most senior family judge, President of the . Family Division Sir James Munby, say that judgments in the family courts . and the Court of Protection must always be publicised unless there are . ‘compelling reasons’ why not. Only children and adults caught up in disputes and members of their families should be protected by anonymity. The . guidelines warn that secrecy prevents families who have been involved . in cases from complaining when they believe they have suffered . injustice. Sir . James said in guidance sent to judges that there would be ‘an immediate . and significant change in practice in relation to the publication of . judgments in family courts and the Court of Protection’. The High Court ruled the woman should not be told of social workers plans to take her baby after birth . He . added: ‘In both courts there is a need for greater transparency in . order to improve public understanding of the court process and . confidence in the court system. ‘At . present too few judgments are made available to the public, which has a . legitimate interest in being able to read what is being done by judges . in its name.’ The . Mail’s campaign revealed last April that the Court of Protection – set . up by the last Labour government to deal with the affairs of those too . ill to make decisions for themselves – had jailed a woman in secret and . without publishing any record. A . Birmingham judge imprisoned Wanda Maddocks, 50, for contempt of court . for trying to get her father out of a care home where he had been . ordered to stay. Miss Maddocks had no lawyer to represent her, and no judgment was published. She served six weeks. In . December we revealed how an Italian mother who had been forced by the . Court of Protection to have a caesarean begged a family court judge in . vain to allow her to keep her baby. Everything that happened to the mother, Alessandra Pacchieri, was decided by the courts in secret. In the same month we disclosed the . case of the ‘irreproachable’ father who spent 12 years and £100,000 in . the family courts trying to win the right to see his 14-year-old . daughter – and who still has not won his case for access. Currently, . secrecy in the family courts – which can remove children from dangerous . parents, order them to be adopted, and decide on their custody – is . governed by 1960 law. This . makes it contempt of court to discuss a case when no judgment has been . published, a crime punishable by two years in prison. Successive . attempts to open up the courts have been thwarted. In . 2006, Labour Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer blocked a law that would . have allowed more light in because state-subsidised charities such as . the NSPCC and the National Children’s Bureau opposed the idea. Labour’s 2005 Mental Capacity Act, pushed through by Lord Falconer, set up the Court of Protection. Its rules say ‘the general rule is that a hearing is to be held in private’. Sir James Munby, who took over a year ago as President of the Family Division, which includes responsibility for both courts, said his new guidance would take effect from February 3. He added that further guidance and formal legal practice directions will follow. There may yet be full Parliamentary legislation, although Sir James said this is ‘unlikely in the near future.’ He said that current rules are ‘inappropriate where family members wish to discuss their experiences in public, identifying themselves and making use of the judgement. ‘Equally, they may be inappropriate in cases where findings have been made against a person and the court concludes it is in the public interest for that person to be identified.’","Family Court and Court of Protection judgements will now be made public .

"Wigan scrum-half Matty Smith has signed a new four-year deal that will keep him at the DW Stadium until the end of 2018. The 27-year-old former St Helens half-back has become an integral member of Shaun Wane's team since joining them from Salford two years ago. He won the Lance Todd Trophy as man of the match in the Warriors' 2013 Challenge Cup final win over Hull, was this week named in the Super League Dream Team for the second successive year and is in pole position to become England's scrum-half in the end-of-year Four Nations Series in Australia and New Zealand. Matty Smith (right) has signed a new four-year deal to extend his stay with Wigan . Wigan coach Shaun Wane said: 'I am so pleased that such an influential and skilful player like Matty has committed his future to us. 'His desire for success is a perfect match for us as a club and an organisation. He wants to be the best and he knows he can achieve that at Wigan.' Smith, who played a key role in Wigan's double-winning success last year, scored 21 points in a man-of-the-match display in Thursday night's 57-4 play-off victory over Huddersfield, taking his tally for the season to 277. 'I love everything about the club,' Smith said. 'Once the contract had been offered, it didn't take me long to make my mind up to sign. 'Wigan have surpassed all the promises that were made when they originally signed me. My game has improved significantly under the guidance of Shaun Wane, who was an important factor in me extending my stay. 'Now I just want to win as much as I can with this great club and with my team-mates, who I enjoying working with so much.'","Wigan Warriors scrum-half Smith signs new four-year deal .

"When Amy Winehouse transformed the musical landscape with her classic albums Frank and Back To Black, a wave of talented homegrown divas emerged in her wake, with Adele, Duffy and Paloma Faith all becoming major stars. But her influence stretched beyond these shores, as Dutch singer Caro Emerald acknowledges. The 31-year-old from Amsterdam, with a Rubenesque figure and voice straight out of the Forties, is gaining a substantial following in this country, thanks to appearances on Strictly Come Dancing, Jools Holland and Children In Need. Forties chic: New fans for 'The Shocking Miss Caro Emerald' Last month, she sold out the Royal Albert Hall, and new dates have been added to her autumn tour. And a lot of the credit, she admits, should go to Amy. ‘She was my big inspiration,’ Caro says. ‘When she came along, there wasn’t much jazz or swing in the charts. But Amy sexed up the whole genre. ‘I discovered her while studying jazz at the Amsterdam Conservatory. I loved the old-school singers but also R&B, hip-hop and soul.’ Winehouse’s lead has given Caro impressive staying power, too. Her million-selling debut, Deleted Scenes From The Cutting Room Floor, this week returned to the UK Top 20, two years after its first chart run. Talent: Caro Emerald bombed out in an audition for Dutch TV talent show  ¿Idol¿ and was making ends meet as a music teacher when she was discovered singing backup . But, as Caro explains, her recording . career began by accident. A struggling session singer in the Dutch . capital, she bombed out in an audition for Dutch TV talent show  ‘Idol’ and was making ends meet as a music teacher when she was invited to sing . on a demo tape by Canadian songwriter Vince Degiorgio and two local . producers. Inspiration: Late singer Amy Winehouse . The song she performed, Back It Up, . was going to be offered to other artists, but  her stunning vocals . changed all that. It became her  first single and launched a partnership . with her team that is still intact. If . Emerald’s music is built around Forties big-band flourishes and . smouldering vocals, her image is also a quirky mix of old and new. Her voluptuous curves are draped in chic vintage clothes on her new album sleeve; sexy but strangely demure. ‘You can be sexy without throwing everything on the table,’ she insists. ‘I wouldn’t have wanted to live in the Forties, though. As a woman, I wouldn’t have the same rights as now. I’m a liberal Amsterdam girl, so I wouldn’t have been happy, but it’s nice to be nostalgic about the past.’ Caro’s new album pushes her music beyond the Hollywood theme of her debut. With its dramatic string sections recorded at Abbey Road, it harks back to the romance of Twenties Paris, with Black Valentine also nodding to Portishead. A stylish sequel, it should further enhance the status of a singer who was once dubbed the ‘Dutch Adele’. ‘Any comparison with Adele is a compliment, though I think my voice is different’ Caro tells me. ‘I’d love to have a beer with her one day.’ The Shocking Miss Emerald is out on May 6 on Dramatico. Caro Emerald’s UK tour starts on September 6 at Sheffield City Hall (gigsandtours.com)","Dutch singer Caro Emerald credits her success to late Amy Winehouse .

"Scotland is on course to reject independence, the leader of the campaign to save the Union has confidently predicted. Better Together leader Alistair Darling insisted internal campaign research put them comfortably ahead, but he suggested half a million people in Scotland have not decided how to vote with opinion polls suggesting the race is neck and neck. First Minister Alex Salmond claimed that people saying they would vote against his dream of independence were 'only deferred ‘Yes’-es', as he faced claims he was embarking on a 'premature victory lap' with four days until the historic referendum. Scroll down for video . Better Together leader Alistair Darling revealed he thinks that as many as 500,000 of the 4.2million people in Scotland have still not decided how to vote in Thursday's referendum . Mr Darling accused his opponent, First Minister Alex Salmond, of embarking on a victory lap instead of answering a string of questions about the key issues facing an independent Scotland . Mr Darling insisted that canvas returns from the Better Together campaign show No is on course for victory. ‘We will win and I know that because I have seen the returns. Be in no doubt about it,’ he said. ‘Our returns are good. Our vote is holding up and we are actually doing very well. He suggested that some voters will go to the ballot box still ‘swithering in their own mind’ about which way to vote and candidly admitted: ‘The situation is quite fluid’. More than 4.2million people have registered to vote in the historic referendum which will decide the fate of the 307-year-old Union. Experts predict the turnout could be as high as 85 per cent. But speaking in Edinburgh yesterday, Mr Darling told journalists there are half a million people who have yet to settle on their decision. He said: 'We have been contacting tens of thousands of people in the last few weeks and our best estimate is of about 500,000 people we think are still to make their minds up. ‘You do get people at this late stage where people are going from yes to no to yes and back again. ‘The situation is quite fluid. There will be a lot of people who my guess is when they go into the polling station may be swithering in their own mind. ‘People maybe in the space of a day might change their mind. I do believe the silent majority in Scotland does not want to take on the risks of independence.’ The latest raft of opinion polls all point to differing results, but suggest the result is too close to call. A Panelbase survey for The Sunday Times put No on 50.6 per cent and Yes 49.4 per cent. A poll by Survation gave the No campaign an eight-point lead on 54 per cent to 46 per cent while an Opinium survey in The Observer put No on 53 per cent and Yes 47 per cent. However, a surprise ICM poll for the Sunday Telegraph put the Yes campaign eight points ahead, on 54 per cent, although it was based on a survey size of only 700 people. The opponents appeared on the BBC Andrew Marr show to discuss Thursday's vote. SNP leader Alex Salmond looked jovial as he attempted to play the violin . Confident: Chairman of the Better Together campaign, Alistair Darling, said he was certain Scots would vote against independence after reviewing internal research . When asked about the number of voters yet to choose a side, of which there are an estimated 500,000, Alex Salmond referred to them as 'deferred Yes-es'. He joined Scottish singer Amy McDonald (right) and bands Franz Ferdinand, Frightened Rabbit and Mogwai at Edinburgh's Usher Hall today . 'Premature victory lap': With just four days until the historic vote, the First Minister of Scotland said he was already certain voters would sway towards independence and is celebrating in advance . Amy McDonald signed Saltires with the SNP leader today in Edinburgh at a pro-independence rally . But he warned that the result would be decisive. ‘If we vote to leave by one vote there is no going back. We will have bought a one way ticket with no return. This is not something we can try out.’ He said that with five days to go until the vote, there were still five questions about jobs, currency, pensions, prices and funding public services which Mr Salmond has failed to answer. In an interview on BBC1’s Andrew Marr show today, he accused Mr Salmond of doing a “premature victory lap” ahead of the polling day. “We still don’t know how we can ensure that we don’t lose jobs, with firms saying they are going to take their headquarters out of Scotland – that would be a disaster for Scotland. ‘We still don’t know how we are going to replace the additional funding we get for the National Health Service. ‘We don’t know who is going to pay pensions and you were asking Alex Salmond a few moments ago about currency and he seemed to be doing a rather premature victory lap even before most of us have voted. ‘But he was just simply asserting that low and behold on Friday morning, everybody else is wrong, they are all going to fall in line with what he is going to say.’ Planning ahead: The First Minister let slip he was planning to attend the Ryder Cup if the vote for independence is secured on Thursday . With conflicting polling results being published with just four days to go and an estimated half-a-million voters still undecided, Mr Darling (right) said the situation was 'fluid'. Experts have said the race is too close to call at this point . The opposing campaign leaders shook hands this morning after an appearance on the Andrew Marr show . The latest Poll of Polls, compiled by political expert Professor John Curtice at WhatScotlandThinks.Com, puts the No campaign narrowly ahead on 51 per cent. It follows four new polls overnight, with only an ICM survey for the Sunday Telegraph giving the Yes campaign a lead, which based based on a smaller-than-normal sample of only 700 people . As the battle over independence hots, last night saw a spectacular fireworks display and Vikings carrying flaming torches to mark the 50th anniversary of the Forth Road Bridge . Hundreds of festival goers showed their support for the Union next to the Auld Acquaintance Cairn in Gretna where the Britrocks festival was held on Saturday . Mr Salmond insisted if Scotland votes for independence, it will be a 'day of celebration' Mr Salmond today let slip that he is planning a visit to watch the Ryder Cup golf tournament within days of breaking up the 300-year-old Union. The Scottish First Minister revealed that if he secures victory in his battle for independence, he will travel to Gleneagles to watch the likes of Rory McIlroy and Tom Watson teeing off. Mr Salmond's wife Moira has reportedly encouraged him to play golf during the independence campaign to help clear his head . After dire warnings that Yes vote could trigger economic catastrophe, No campaigners accused Mr Salmond of embarking on a 'premature victory lap' instead of answering key questions about how independence would work in practice. But he also insisted that there will be 'urgent business following a Yes victory on Friday', adding: 'Firstly I think it will be a day of celebration, Scotland will have achieved something astonishing in democratic politics. 'But there's a lot of business to do. And the first and urgent business is to bring Scotland together. 'Because on Friday, after a Yes vote there'll cease to be a Yes campaign and a No campaign. There'll be a Team Scotland. And I've said very clearly that I want into that Team Scotland as many voices as possible, people who have got something to offer and contribute to bring the country together.' He went on: 'One of the great assets of the Yes campaign is we don’t regard any section or sector of Scottish society or any geography of Scotland beyond our reach. 'We tend to take the attitude that there isn’t so much a ‘No’ vote in Scotland. There are only deferred ‘Yes’-es. And that’s been one of the successes of our campaign…' He vowed that that if he loses Thursday's vote, he will not try to force another referendum. 'If you remember previous constitutional referenda in Scotland, there was one in 1979 and the next one was 1997. 'That's what I mean by a political generation… This is a once in a generation, perhaps even a once in a lifetime opportunity for Scotland.' Mr Salmond's wife Moria is reportedly credited with encouraging the First Minister to regularly take time out from the referendum campaign to play golf to 'unwind and clear his head', according to the Sunday Times. It also emerged that Mr Salmond was playing against the 14-year-old son of the greenkeeper at Castle Stuart golf course overlooking the Moray Firth when news broke of an opinion poll putting the Yes campaign ahead last weekend.","With four days until polling day, the situation is 'quite fluid', Darling warns .

Among the great public moments of the reign for which he provides additional insight is the Coronation in 1953. In one sequence, he recalls how The Queen practised wearing the Coronation crown around Buckingham Palace – even at bathtime. ‘I . remember my Mama coming, you know, up, when we were being bathed as . children, wearing the crown.  It was quite funny – practising,’ he says.

'Amazing poise': The Queen, pictured on her Coronation tour in October 1953, is held in 'respect and affection' by leaders across the globe, Charles says . Watching . the footage some sixty years later, the Prince comments on his mother’s . ‘amazing poise’ and, later, her ‘natural grace’. Although . the prince and his mother have found themselves at odds over the years, . with Charles accusing her of being a somewhat aloof figure, he adds: . ‘My Mama takes great pride in her family, from being a young mother at . the start of her reign, to now being a great grandmother twice over.’ He . demonstrates this by showing pictures to illustrate the more personal . aspect of very public moments, such as his mother and father visiting . him on sports day Hill House School, West London, in the summer of 1957. In his tribute, the prince also draws extensively from news archive to remind us of key public moments such the spectacle of the Coronation, and The Queen’s many overseas tours and visits. ‘I think just the sheer number of Heads of State who are coming to the Jubilee celebrations shows the respect and affection with which my mama is held all around the world,’ he says. ‘I so admire the way she’s managed to hold that unique association – the Commonwealth – together.’ The Prince also points out that The Queen has opened Parliament in Britain 59 times, adding: ‘I’ve always thought my Mama looks absolutely wonderful in that tiara’ before noting that two of her twelve Prime Ministers were not even born when she came to the throne. ‘The fact that my Mama has been a constant feature on the scene has provided that sense, I think, of continuity in a time of immense change over 60 years,’ he says. ‘The Queen has provided an amazing record of devotion, dedication and commitment.’ A Jubilee Tribute to The Queen by The Prince of Wales will be broadcast on BBC One at 8pm on Friday 1st June 2012.

"Arsene Wenger admits he was worried about his players being 'on the edge physically' before Mathieu Debuchy was sent off during Arsenal's 1-0 Champions League qualifier win against Besiktas. Alexis Sanchez's first Gunners goal was enough to put his side into the Champions League group stages on Wednesday night, but it didn't go all Arsenal's way. Arsenal had to finish the match with 10 men after Mathieu Debuchy was sent off for collecting a second yellow card when the Frenchman dragged Mustafa Pektemek to the ground with 15 minutes left to play.

Off you go: Debuchy is shown a red card for a foul on Mustafa Pektemek in the second half . Wenger said: 'I was very worried because you never know as we have some players on the edge physically. 'I thought it was very harsh because Debuchy played the ball and maybe with the anger from our side on the bench we saw he played the ball. The referee was on the other side. The Arsenal boss also expressed his relief at Arsenal qualifying success as they now await Thursday afternoon's Champions League draw. He added: ‘It is unthinkable until it happens then everyone thinks why it’s happened, but now it's a weight off our shoulders.’ Portugal’s Pedro Proenca is one of Europe’s most experienced referess but had a poor night. He missed two Besiktas penalties for fouls by Mathieu Debuchy and Jack Wilshere, then sent off Debuchy for an innocuous challenge which he deemed to be a second yellow.

"Most children of her age would struggle to sit through an opera. But at just seven years old, Alma Deutscher has already composed her own. The talented youngster has become a classical music sensation after her first major composition was highly commended by the English National Opera. And not only is Alma an accomplished composer, she is also a skilled violinist and pianist. Gifted: Alma Deutscher can play both the piano and violin and, at the age of seven, has composed her own opera . Videos of her work have been viewed more than 300,000 times since her father shared them on YouTube – and her abilities have led to comparisons with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who by five had mastered the keyboard and violin and started composing. Alma wrote her own sonata at the age of six, followed by her opera, The Sweeper of Dreams, this year. She said: ‘The music comes to me when I’m relaxing. I go and sit down on a seat or lie down. I like thinking about fairies a lot, and princesses, and beautiful dresses.’ She added that her best compositions are created when she is on the swing in the garden at her home in Dorking, Surrey, but she keeps a tape recorder by her bed for when inspiration strikes. The idea for The Sweeper of Dreams – which narrowly missed out on a place in the final of an English National Opera contest for adult composers – came in a dream. Take note: Alma had mastered the keyboard and violin and started composing by the time she was five . She said: ‘Mozart composed this piece in my dream and when I got up, I sat down and played it and my father recorded it.’ Alma’s father Guy, an Israeli-born linguist and amateur flautist, said he realised his daughter had a connection with music when she was a baby. She was given her first violin for her third birthday and in less than a year she was playing Handel sonatas. Supportive: Sisters Helen and Alma with their parents Janie and Guy . Mr Deutscher and his wife Janie, 39, who was an organ scholar at Oxford, moved with Alma and her four-year-old sister Helen from Oxford to Surrey so that they could be closer to the specialist Yehudi Menuhin School in Cobham and Alma has weekly piano and violin lessons with teachers from the school. The rest of the time, she is taught at home, and practises and composes for between four and five hours a day. But her parents refuse to let her take part in competitions or music exams, and have turned down invitations to appear on television shows. Mr Deutscher added: ‘She works hard but she has a very happy childhood and we are absolutely determined to protect this.’ Alma's still too little for her feet to touch the ground when she's playing the piano.  A pile of books help her when she practises and composes at home . Although comparisons with Mozart are inevitable, Alma is determined to maintain her own identity . Alma, meanwhile, is working on a cello sonata that she was commissioned to write after performing one of her compositions in Italy. ‘It’s not the same style as my first sonata,’ she explained. ‘It’s very dramatic. It’s more like Tchaikovsky than Mozart.’ When she is older,  she wants a ‘big house full of instruments, all sorts of pianos and violins, violas and cellos’. ‘I don’t mind if I am famous or not, I just want to be good,’ she added. ‘I look at other composers but I’m not trying to become exactly like Mozart. Yeah, I like him, but I’m going to be like Alma, not Mozart.’","First major composition highly commended by the English National Opera .

"They called him a gentleman of the skies – a British First World War fighter ace who maintained the utmost respect for his adversary. Through brilliant flying and extraordinary gallantry, Captain Gerald Gibbs downed a succession of German aircraft to become one of the most successful pilots of his generation. But he always treated enemy airmen as equals, even when he had them in his gunsights. Now the full extent of his chivalry has emerged in a newly-discovered 96-year-old fan-mail letter from two grateful Germans. Captain Gerald Gibbs (left), took this picture along with his observer (far right) and two German pilots (centre) after taking them prisoner. He treated the men to dinner, and two weeks later they sent him fan mail . The observer and his pilot wrote to Capt Gibbs after he spared their lives when he crippled their aircraft’s engine but then allowed them to land safely behind British lines in March 1918. He landed himself and was photographed with the pair before treating them to lunch in the officers’ mess and handing them over – ‘rather sadly’ as he wrote at the time – to a prison escort. The following month the observer, Lt Robert Walther, wrote by hand to their 21-year-old captor asking for some autographed photos as ‘a reminder of the brave and quixotic adversary in aerial combat’. It was signed ‘with chummy German airman greetings’ and wished him ‘much luck’. It is unclear if Capt Gibbs supplied a signed photo but he did drop a letter over enemy lines to say the airmen were safe. Lt Walther’s note was discovered in the leaves of a wartime scrapbook kept by Capt Gibbs, who also served in the Second World War and ended his career in the RAF as Air Marshal Sir Gerald Gibbs. Captain Gerald Gibbs forced a German plane to land and captured two airmen, but he treated them as equals . In the note (pictured) the two captives asked Captain Gibbs for a singed photograph to remember him by, before wishing him 'much luck' and singing off 'with chummy German airman greetings' Captain Gibbs was known as a formidable pilot during the First World War. He shot down ten enemy planes, and was awarded the Military Cross three times for conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty . Mr Gibbs went on to serve as Deputy Air Chief Marshal during the Second World War, and then as a test pilot he helped introduce De Hallivand Vampire jet fighters to the RAF in the Fifties (left, right a collection of his photos) Mr Gibbs was awarded a total 15 medals during his time with the RAF. From top left to bottom right, they are: Knight of the British Empire with breast star, Citation of the Indian Empire, Military Cross, with second and third bar, British War Medal, British Victory Medal, General Service 1918-1962 Medal, 1939-1945 Star, Burma Star, Defence Medal, War Medal, Jubilee 1935 Medal, Coronation 1953 Medal, French Legion of Honor medal, French Croix De Guerre medal . The note from the two German airmen was found among a notebook kept by Captain Gibbs which was passed down through generations of his family before being auctioned . It was passed down through his family and is now being sold with the officer’s impressive set of 15 medals. Also included is various memorabilia, plus his snapshot of the two captured Germans. The single lot is tipped to sell for £18,000 at a September 19 auction by London-based Dix Noonan Webb. Capt Gibbs was credited with ten ‘kills’ during the Mesopotamia campaign in the Middle East. He was shot down twice and received the Military Cross three times in six months of 1918. The first was for driving two German aircraft into the ground on two separate occasions. The second was for bombing a German aerodrome from 100ft before firing 200 rounds into the hangars from just 20ft, then heading off in pursuit of enemy aircraft. The third was for capturing the armed German reconnaissance plane and its two crew on March 20, 1918. Capt Gibbs, who came from South Norwood, near Croydon, gained an Army commission in 1915 but transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in 1917. He died in 1992, aged 96.","Captain Gerald Gibbs forced German plane to land and captured two airmen .

"Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad is continuing to use chemical weapons on his own civilians, according to the results of tests carried out at the sites of suspected gas attacks. The claim was made after samples were taken from the ground by trained professionals near the spot where three suspected attacks took place in the war-torn country. A weapons expert has now analysed the soil samples which have shown traces of chlorine and ammonia - both of which can be used in the production of chemical weapons - at all three sites. Scroll down for video . Children are pictured receiving oxygen in Kfar Zeita, a rebel-held village in Hama province 125 miles north of Damascus on April 16. Syrian opposition activists and claim government forces have attacked rebel-held areas with poisonous chlorine gas in recent months . It comes on yet another day of violence in the country in which two car bombs exploded in a pro-government neighbourhood in the central city of Homs - blasts which state officials say killed at least 40 people. State media claims that mortar strikes that happened just hours earlier in the heart of the capital Damascus killed a further 14, though figures vary . The latest chemical weapons claim was made as the global watchdog overseeing the destruction of Syria’s toxic stockpile prepares to send a fact-finding mission to Syria to investigate allegations by rebels and activists of chlorine gas attacks. The Hague-based Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said President Bashar al-Assad's government had agreed to accept the mission and had promised to provide security in areas under its control. But speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Hamish De Bretton-Gordon, a British chemical weapons expert involved in the recent soil sample testing, said: ‘We have unequivocally proved that the regime has used chlorine and ammonia against its own civilians in the last two to three weeks. ‘In each of the samples we have found evidence of chlorine. An image taken from video obtained from the Shaam News Network in which two women and a young girl are treated by a medic in Kfar Zeita. Research has been carried out by a weapons expert on soil samples taken from other suspected attack sites . ‘Also, the samples indicate that ammonia has also been used in Kafr Zita.’ The samples are said to have been collected from attacks that happened on April 11, 18 and 21 from people who were trained up especially for the task. Assad and his regime has once again denied claims that it used chemical weapons calling it a ‘baseless allegation’. But The Telegraph, who asked for the tests to be carried out, reports that some of the toxins came from barrels that were dropped from helicopters in the province of Idlib, where there are reported to have been eight separate chemical attacks on rebel held communities in just two weeks. The OPCW has yet to say when it will carry out its fact finding mission. Accusations by rebels and Syrian activist of at least three separate chlorine gas attacks by Assad's forces in the last month have exposed the limits of a deal which Assad agreed last year for the destruction of his chemical arsenal. The accord followed a sarin gas attack on rebel-held outskirts of Damascus last August in which hundreds of people were killed. A man carries a wounded girl following a reported bombardment with explosive-packed 'barrel bombs' by Syrian government forces in the al-Mowasalat neighborhood of the northern Syrian city of Aleppo on Sunday. Assad's regime is now being blamed for carrying out chemical attacks in the Idlib province within the last two weeks . Washington and its allies blamed Assad's forces for the attack, but Damascus authorities said rebels carried it out to try to force Western military intervention. Damascus has now shipped out or destroyed 92 percent of the chemicals it pledged to eliminate. However chlorine, which also has many industrial uses, was never included in the list submitted to the OPCW. The U.S. State Department said last week that if Syrian authorities used chlorine gas with the intent to kill or harm this would violate the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which it joined as part of last year's agreement. In addition to the possible chlorine use, diplomats say Western powers believe Syria may have not have declared all of its chemical stockpiles - an accusation which Syria has denied. Meanwhile, state news agency Sana said the car bomb blast that struck in the predominantly Christian and Alawite neighbourhood of Abbasiyeh in Homs killed at least 40 and wounded another 116. This picture, of a boy said to have been injured in today's mortar bomb blasts in Damascas which claimed the lives of 14 people, was released by Syria's national news agency SANA. Doctors treat a wounded Syrian boy at a hospital in Damascus, Syria following mortar attacks in central Damascus on Tuesday . Homs has been an opposition stronghold since the uprising against Assad erupted in March 2011. Syria’s third largest city has been the scene of some of the fiercest fighting in the civil war that followed the initially peaceful revolt. In Damascus, several mortar shells slammed into the predominantly Shiite neighborhood of Shaghour, killing 14 people and wounding 86, Sana and state TV reported. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, which came a day after president Bashar Assad declared his candidacy for the June 3 presidential elections, a race he is likely to win. Such attacks are common in Homs and Damascus, and there was no immediate indication that the violence was directly related to Assad's announcement.","Samples suggest chemical weapons used in recent attacks in Syria .

"A Czech fraudster who flew vulnerable foreign nationals to Britain so they could falsely claim £1.2million in benefits has been jailed after spending almost six months on the run. Magdalena Ferkova, 33, was part of a five-strong family gang who made £33,000 a week from the scam - but she fled Britain in November during her trial. A European Arrest Warrant was issued the next month and finally she was recaptured in her home country and returned to Britain. Ringleaders: Julius Ziga, left, 34, and . Magdalena Ferkova, right, 33, brought Czechs and Slovaks to claim child . tax credits in Britain then continued collecting the cash after the . foreigners returned to Eastern Europe . Also jailed: Iveta Ferkova, 32, left, and Jan . Lacko, 39, right, were part of the gang which managed around 50 . fraudulent child tax credit claims to pocket up to £33,000 a week, much . of which was gambled away . Ferkova and her partner, Julius Ziga, . 34, masterminded a racket in which countless false claims were made for . tax credits and child benefit. They and her sister Iveta, 32, their aunt Alena Lackova, 39, and Lackova's husband Jan Lacko, 39, spent their criminal gains in casinos and on luxury cars - including a Mercedes and BMW 5 Series. Their . trial at Nottingham Crown Court heard they successfully took £750,000 . and would have made another £500,000 had they not been caught. During . the scam, the couple arranged for vulnerable foreign nationals from the . Czech Republic and Slovakia to be brought to Nottingham, where they . were told they would be given jobs. The . gang then took their passports, housed them in the city temporarily and . 'helped' them to get a National Insurance number and open a bank . account. Fraudsters: Iveta Ferkova, Alena Lackova and Jan Lacko, pictured outside Nottingham Crown Court before they were sentenced. They were allowed bail during the trial and Magdalena Ferkova fled the country . Incriminating: A list found on Magdalena Ferkova when she was arrested where she had written out pin numbers and days of the week to draw out tax credit money from the gang's various accounts . After forcing the individuals to make applications for tax credits and Child Benefit, the gang sent the claimants home. Ferkova, . who lived in Nottingham while in the UK, absconded during the trial last year and a warrant was issued for her arrest. She was tracked down in her home country after . officials at HM Revenue & Customs listed her on their Most Wanted . gallery of tax fugitives. Carolyn . Norsworthy, assistant director in charge of criminal investigation, said: 'Magdalena Ferkova thought she could . flee the country to avoid justice. She was wrong. 'We . have tracked her down and, working with the Czech authorities, have . brought her before the UK courts so justice can be served. CCTV footage of the HSBC in Arnold, Nottingham, shows Magdalena Ferkova with Julius Pesta: . The gang got National Insurance numbers for the workers and posed as . interpreters in interviews at banks and Jobcentres .

'Ferkova . was part of an extremely well-organised and ruthless crime group, . committed to stealing vast amounts of public money at the expense of the . British taxpayer. 'They . exploited the many people they lured to the UK from abroad with the . promise of legal employment, but then manipulated and discarded them.' Ferkova was brought before Nottingham Crown Court today where she was jailed for five years. Judge James Sampson told her: 'You are obviously a clever woman and intelligent, but thoroughly dishonest and a brazen liar.' The series of 77 false claims were made to HMRC . between January 1, 2008 and April 14, 2010, and the four other gang members received sentences totalling 12 years. All five denied conspiracy to commit fraud by making false representations, except Ziga, who pleaded guilty.

Victim: Benjamin Colton Barnes (R) was said to have shot dead Margaret Anderson, a mother of two young daughters, at the national park near Seattle . SWAT teams more used to urban standoffs trekked deep into the backcountry, unfamiliar territory for them. 'We have SWAT team members with . snowshoes on the side of a mountain,' Pierce County Sheriff's spokesman . Ed Troyer said. 'This has never happened before.' Immediately after Sunday's shooting, police cleared out the park of visitors and mounted a manhunt. Fear that tourists could be caught in . the crossfire in a shootout with Barnes, who had survivalist training, . prompted officials to hold more than a 100 people at the visitors' centre before evacuating them in the middle of the night. 'Strong person of interest': Benjamin Colton Barnes, who cops say has a military background and strong wilderness survival skills, is also a suspect in an earlier shooting incident at a New Year's Eve party . Tragedy in the woods: The flag flew at half-staff at the entrance to Mount Rainier National Park in Washington after Ranger Margaret Anderson was shot dead . Barnes, who was believed to be . carrying a cache of weapons, has had a troubled transition to civilian . life, with accusations he suffers post-traumatic stress disorder and is . suicidal. He was involved in a custody dispute . in Tacoma July, during which his toddler daughter's mother sought a . temporary restraining order against him, according to court documents. Mark of respect: Park rangers at Mount Rainier National Park covered their badges to mourn colleague Margaret Anderson . The woman told authorities he was . suicidal and possibly suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after . deploying to Iraq in 2007-2008, and had once sent her a text message . saying 'I want to die.' She alleged that he gets easily . irritated, angry and depressed and keeps an arsenal of weapons in his . home. She wrote that she feared for the child's safety. Undated photos . provided by police showed a shirtless, tattooed Barnes brandishing two . large weapons. In November 2011, a guardian ad litem . recommended parenting and communication classes for both parents and . recommending Barnes be allowed to continue supervised visits with the . child, two days a week. That visitation schedule was to . continue until he completed a domestic violence evaluation and mental . health evaluation and complied with all treatment recommendations. Late Sunday police said Barnes was a suspect in another shooting incident. On New Year's, there was an argument . at a house party in Skyway, south of Seattle, and gunfire erupted, . police said. Four people in their 20s were reported injured, two . critically. Barnes was connected to the shooting, said Sgt Cindi West, . King County Sheriff's spokeswoman. It is believed that the man had been . asked to leave after an argument over a gun. The man came back with a . weapon and opened fire on the crowd, according to police. Wanted: Benjamin Colton Barnes is believed to have gunned down a U.S. Forest Service ranger after shooting four people at a New Year's Eve house party . Manhunt: Police released this picture of Iraq War veteran Benjamin Colton Barnes . Police believe Barnes headed to the . remote park wilderness to 'hide out' following the Skyway shooting. There were children present in the home at the time of the shooting. 'The speculation is that he may have . come up here, specifically for that reason, to get away,' parks . spokesman Kevin Bacher told reporters early Monday. 'The speculation is . he threw some stuff in the car and headed up here to hide out.' Mrs Anderson had set up a roadblock . on Sunday morning to stop a man who had blown through a checkpoint . rangers use to check if vehicles have tire chains for winter conditions. A gunman opened fire on her before she was able to exit her vehicle, . authorities say. Before fleeing, the gunman fired shots at both Anderson and the ranger that trailed him, but only Anderson was hit. Mrs Anderson would have been armed, . as she was one of the rangers tasked with law enforcement, parks . spokesman Kevin Bacher said. Troyer said she was shot before she had . even got out of the vehicle. Loss: Park Ranger Ralph Davis reading a copy of the Tacoma News Tribune after his colleague Margaret Anderson was shot dead .

Scene of the crime: A police officer examines the car that the shooting suspect was driving at Mount Rainier National when he was stopped by Park Ranger Margaret Anderson . Park superintendent Randy King said . Anderson, a 34-year-old mother of two young girls who was married to . another Rainier ranger, had served as a park ranger for about four . years. King said Anderson's husband also was working as a ranger elsewhere in the park at the time of the shooting. Mapped out: A board showing Pierce County Sheriff's search for Benjamin Colton Barnes . Mrs Anderson graduated from Westfield . High School, New Jersey in 1995 and fulfilled her dream of becoming a . park ranger, according to local newspaper the Westfield Patch. She met her husband through work and they married in 2005. The couple had two daughters, Anna, three, and one-year-old Katie. Adam Norton, a neighbour of . Anderson's in the small town of Eatonville, Washington, said the . ranger's family moved in about a year ago. He said they were not around much, . but when they were Norton would see Anderson outside with her girls. 'They just seemed like the perfect family,' he said. The town of about 3,000 residents, which is a logging community overlooking Mount Rainier, is very close knit, he said. 'It's really sad right now,' Norton said. 'We take care of each other.' Police have been in contact with . Barnes' family, trying to have them coax him to 'come to the police and . tell his side of the story'. The shooting has meanwhile renewed . debate about a federal law that made it legal for people to take loaded . weapons into national parks. The 2010 law made possession of firearms . subject to state gun laws. Bill Wade, the outgoing chair of the . Coalition of National Park Service Retirees, said Congress should be . regretting its decision. 'The many congressmen and senators . that voted for the legislation that allowed loaded weapons to be brought . into the parks ought to be feeling pretty bad right now,' said Wade. Remote: Mount Rainier National Park in Washington covers a vast area . Wade called Sunday's fatal shooting a . tragedy that could have been prevented. He hopes Congress will . reconsider the law that took effect in early 2010, but doubts that will . happen in today's political climate. Calls and emails to the National Rifle Association requesting comment were not immediately returned on Monday. The NRA said media fears of gun . violence in parks were unlikely to be realised, the NRA wrote in a . statement about the law after it went into effect. 'The new law affects . firearms possession, not use,' it said. The group pushed for the law saying people have a right to defend themselves against park animals and other people. Bacher, the parks spokesman, said . surviving overnight in the open on Rainier is difficult, but not . impossible for a person with gear and skills. He added that authorities . wouldn't shed tears if Colton didn't survive. 'I don't think any of us would be sorry if he was not in a condition to fire on our searchers this morning,' Bacher said.

"A father and his 12-year-old son died in a blaze sparked when an assault rifle discharged in a room packed with ammunition at their home. Terry York, 48, is thought to have been showing his AR-15 rifle to friends in a back room at his Tennessee home when the weapon accidentally discharged on Sunday, causing a fire and a string of explosions.

The flames 'did not seem too threatening at first', relatives of the victims said, but the blaze grew out of control after Luke came to his father's aid.

Neighbour Kathleen Glass described hearing explosions emerging from the house in Huron, Henderson County. 'I just don't have the words for it because I can not imagine having to go through something like this,' she told the station. Relatives said Mr York stored ammunition in the room where the fire broke out, a report on rawstory.com said, but officials said they would carry out a full investigation into the tragedy before reaching any conclusions.

'Any loss of life is tragic, when a child loses their life it hit the community hard,' Henderson County Sheriff Brian Duke said, adding that investigators were looking into the possibility that the fire started as a result of an accidental discharge of the weapon. Officials said the father and son were discovered mere steps from the door out of the property, but may have been blinded by smoke as they tried to escape.

"Thousands of British patients suffering  from chronic pain and fatigue could be misdiagnosed with psychological problems when they unknowingly have a type of brain damage. Those people who complain of the symptoms are not given a series  of blood tests that can pinpoint the problem, meaning the true cause  is not spotted. Patients are then condemned to years of misery and ineffective therapies. The major cause of the damage is head injury, which can be relatively mild. However, viruses, tumours and even animal bites can be a trigger. Christine Wrighton, who died in 2011, was incorrectly diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome when in fact she was suffering from a brain damage called hypopituitarism . The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence was considering including the condition – called post-traumatic hypopituitarism (PTHP) – in its most recent guidance to doctors on how to treat  head injury. It would have meant patients who turned up at A&E departments or GP surgeries with head injuries would be warned that the symptoms of PTHP – which also include depression, obesity, high blood pressure, loss of libido and even infertility – could take years to emerge. However, when the new recommendations were published in the spring, there was no mention of the problem. The decision has been condemned as ‘nonsensical’ by an expert who treats PTHP. Currently, patients who present with tiredness and chronic pain  are often told they have chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), or fibromyalgia, once other physical causes have been ruled out. They are offered psychotherapy, exercise and antidepressants. However, these are currently found to be ineffective in up to 70 per cent of CFS cases. Numerous studies have shown that between 20 and 30 per cent of the 135,000 patients who suffer a serious head injury also experience damage to the pituitary gland, which is situated below the brain, behind the nasal cavity. Problem area: The size of the pituitary gland and delay of symptoms means the bran damage is often misdiagnosed as a psychological problem . The gland produces vital hormones that govern many bodily functions, including growth and repair, the sleep-wake cycle and how we react to stress. If the pea-sized organ is damaged, it may stop producing one or more of the essential hormones, triggering the wide-ranging symptoms of hypopituitarism. Studies suggest there could be between 18,000 and 30,000 cases in the UK each year. Treatment involves lifelong hormone replacement therapy, which  is said to be highly effective but costs up to £6,000 a year. Professor Christopher Thompson, one of Britain’s foremost experts  on PTHP, says: ‘The overwhelming evidence from research studies carried out independently in a wide range of places, including the USA, Europe and Turkey, is that hypopituitarism occurs in up to 30 per cent of people who have survived moderate or severe traumatic brain injury. There is no debate. ‘However, the failure to make the right diagnosis after such injury means patients miss out on essential treatment. That it’s not included in the NICE guidelines [for treatment of head injury] is nonsensical.’ Serious head injury is defined as an injury causing unconsciousness for more than 15 minutes. However, some studies suggest even knocks that lead to a minor concussion, or repeated small impacts such as heading a football, may damage the pituitary gland. PTHP sufferer Jill Mizen, 67, was misdiagnosed with CFS in 2006, having suffered from pain and blood pressure problems for almost 20 years. A former BT manager, she was advised to exercise more, but found her condition worsened. During her illness, Jill was screened for deficiency in the hormone cortisol, a characteristic of hypopituitarism. However, the test – known as the short synacthen  test (SST) – produced a normal result. ‘That was when I was told I had CFS,’ she says. Yet SST misses two of out every five cases where the cause of cortisol deficiency is damage to the pituitary. In 2007, Jill came across  a magazine article about Christine Wrighton, who was incorrectly diagnosed with CFS when in fact she was suffering from hypopituitarism. ‘Eventually, after huge persistence, Christine was able to pay privately for a test which the NHS would accept. This proved she had been right all along – her pituitary was faulty. Her story opened my eyes,’ says Jill. Coincidentally, the two women were patients at the same hospital and struck up a friendship. Jill says: ‘Doctors believe Christine’s hypopituitarism was caused by inflammation – she suffered rheumatoid arthritis for 30 years. In 2005 she had a virus that wouldn’t go, and the fatigue started then.’ Jill chose to be retested privately with the more reliable glucagon stimulation test, and was diagnosed as being deficient in cortisol and growth hormone. This proved she too had hypopituitarism. Sadly, Christine died in July 2011 from complications related to her arthritis treatment, perhaps exacerbated by the fatigue she had suffered for so many years. Dr John Newell Price, consultant endocrinologist at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield and chairman of the Pituitary Foundation Medical Committee, says: ‘A “pass” on an SST may not always mean cortisol deficiency is excluded.’ He recommends referral to an endocrinologist if symptoms persist, so that the glucagon test can be carried out. Today, Jill wonders whether a concussion she suffered after jumping off a roundabout as a toddler could have caused the damage. Now she is having hormone therapy, her symptoms improved. Last Christmas she once again had the energy to cook a proper family dinner and put on make-up. ‘It sounds silly,’ she says, ‘but I hadn’t had the energy to do that for years.’ For more information visit pituitary.org.uk or call 0845 450 0376.","Patients misdiagnosed with CFS when they have brain damage .

"Pope Francis has said he wants 'a poor Church, for the poor' following his election as head of the Catholic Church. In . a meeting with journalists, the Pontiff said he was inspired to choose . the name Francis after the 12th Century saint Francis of Assisi. He . said when news broke that he had been selected, a Brazilian colleague . embraced him in congratulations and whispered 'don't forget the poor'. He chose the Italian saint because he represented 'poverty and peace'. Pope Francis revealed to journalists his hopes for the church, and how he came to select his name . 'Let me tell you a story,' Francis said in a break from his prepared text during a special gathering for thousands of journalists, media workers and guests in the Vatican's auditorium. Francis then described how he was comforted by his friend, Brazilian Cardinal Claudio Hummes, as it appeared the voting was going his way and it seemed 'a bit dangerous' that he would reach the two-thirds necessary to be elected. When the threshold was reached, applause erupted in the frescoed Sistine Chapel. 'He (Hummes) hugged me. He kissed me. He . said don't forget about the poor,' Francis said. 'And that's how in . my heart came the name Francis of Assisi,' who devoted his life to the . poor, missionary outreach and caring for God's creation. Pope Francis I sits in the Paul VI general audience hall during an audience for members of the media . The pope thanked the media and told them how he had come to choose his name, saying he wanted Francis of Assisi who represented 'poverty and peace' He said some have wondered whether . his name was a reference to other Francis figures, including St. Frances . de Sales or even the co-founder of the pope's Jesuit order, Francis . Xavier. But he said he was inspired immediately after the election when he thought about wars. St . Francis of Assisi, the pope said, was 'the man of the poor. The man of . peace. 'The man who loved and cared for creation - and in this moment we . don't have such a great relationship with creation. The man who gives us . this spirit of peace, the poor man. 'Oh how I would like a poor church and a church for the poor,' Francis said, sighing. He . then joked that some other cardinals suggested other names: Hadrian VI, . after a great church reformer - a reference to the need for the pope to . clean up the Vatican's messy bureaucracy. Pope Francis I greeted a blind journalist and his guide dog, and warmly greeted those who had come to hear him speak . Pope Francis will now begin a busy week where he will meet the Argentinian president and his predecessor . Someone else suggested Clement XV, to counter Clement XIV, who suppressed the Jesuit order in 1773. He urged journalists to share the church's focus on 'truth, goodness and beauty', and thanked them for their hard work. The pope shook hands, held them, embraced people and was warm. A . blind reporter who was accompanied by a guide dog met the pope, and he . patted the dog and stroked it, to cheers from the audience, Sky news . reported. The gathering in the Vatican begins a busy week for the pontiff that includes his installation Mass on Tuesday. Among the talks, the Vatican said Saturday, will be a session with the president of Francis' homeland Argentina on Monday. The pope has sharply criticized . Christina Fernandez over her support for liberal measures such as gay . marriage and free contraceptives. Pope . Francis will visit his predecessor at the papal retreat at Castel . Gandolfo next Saturday in a historic encounter that brings together the . new pope and the first pope to resign in six centuries. Newly elected Pope Francis waves as he held his first meeting with journalists - who praised him for his warmth and friendliness . The new Archbishop of Canterbury will miss the inauguration of Pope Francis due to him being on a 'pilgrimage of prayer'. Archbishop Justin Welby is to be represented at next Tuesday's event by the Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, in Rome, as he will be on a 'Journey in Prayer' around the Province of Canterbury . While religious leaders gather in Rome for the Pope's inauguration mass, the Most Rev Welby will be in Chichester for the concluding part of his journey. Archbishop Sentamu will lead an Anglican group of fraternal delegates representing the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Anglican Communion who will attend both the inauguration mass on Tuesday and an audience with the new Pope on the following day. The . meeting will be private, but every comment and gesture on the sidelines . will be scrutinised for hints of how the unprecedented relationship . will take shape between the emeritus pontiff and his successor. Benedict has been out of the public eye since officially leaving the papacy on February 28. The . Vatican dismissed any suggestion that the former pope helped shaped the . discussions inside the secret gathering of cardinals that selected . Buenos Aires Archbishop Jorge Bergoglio on Wednesday as the first . pontiff from Latin America. Vatican officials said there was no contact between the papal electors and Benedict before the conclave. World leaders and senior international envoys, including Vice President Joe Biden, are expected on Tuesday for the formal installation of Pope Francis. It offers the new pope his first opportunities to flex his diplomatic skills as head of Vatican city-state. But the most potentially sensitive talks could come with Fernandez after years of open tensions over the then-archbishop's strong opposition to initiatives that led Argentina to become Latin American country to legalize gay marriage. He also opposed - but failed to stop - Fernandez from promoting free contraception and artificial insemination.","Chose St Francis of Assisi because he represented 'poverty and peace'

"A baby who was given just a 3 per cent chance of survival at birth has beaten the odds to come home after six months in hospital. Tiny Jacob Reed has spent every day of his life clinging to survival in hospital, fighting an ultra-rare condition. His chances of survival were so slim, that before he was born doctors told his mother Pippa Stanley, 26, that she should abort him a dozen times. Mini-miracle: Pippa Stanley with her six-month-old son Jacob Reed, who doctors told her when she was pregnant would stand a 3 per cent chance of survival after birth . Survivor: Jacob in an incubator after being born with a disease that affects one in 3.5million children called internal and external juvenile xanthogranulomatosis . But Jacob fought on and has finally been taken back to the family home in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, for the first time. Miss Stanley said: 'The doctors all said he had no hope, no hope at all - but now he's home. 'We were told he had a 3 per cent chance of survival but as each week passed he just got better and better.' Jacob was born with a disease which affects just one in 3.5million children called internal and external juvenile xanthogranulomatosis. It is so rare, British doctors have only seen 30 cases in the last 150 years. He has been on the brink of death several times and once even had to be resuscitated by his own mother. But now, in spite of doctor's dire predictions, Miss Stanley can finally give her son his first cuddles. Miss Stanley and her partner Tim Reed, 32, were overjoyed when they found out they were expecting twins in September last year, 12 months to the day after suffering a heartbreaking miscarriage. But problems became apparent 12 weeks into the pregnancy and the couple discovered that one of the twins had sadly died. The pair feared that the tragedy of September 2010 would be repeated two-fold. But Jacob refused to give up his chance of life, something he proved a month later when his mother's waters broke. Proud: Jacob is held by his father Tim Stanley during his extended hospital stay . Clinging to life: Jacob inside a UV incubator . At 16 weeks, Miss Stanley's amniotic fluid began to leak, prompting doctors' concerns that his lungs would not grow without it. At 25 weeks, she was rushed to Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital, which specialises in premature births. Doctors there said his chances of survival were so small they repeatedly advised Miss Stanley to terminate the pregnancy. They warned Jacob would be deformed and would struggle to live outside the womb. But on February 29, Jacob was born weighing just 2lb 10oz and breathing on his own. Miss Stanley said: 'When we discovered Jacob was still clinging on in the womb, it was like my miscarried son had sent me a little part of himself back from heaven to say ""there's a bit of me living on with you"". 'But then with the amniotic fluid, it was just a waiting game, every minute, every second. 'I was a ticking timebomb waiting to go off. My life was on a knife edge. 'Doctors said they would not help him breathe if he failed to take his first breath. It was such a difficult time. 'But then he did and I was elated, amazed and thrilled. It was like my little, wonderful boy had stuck two fingers up to the doctors who had not believed in him.' Worrying time: Miss Stanley is overjoyed to have finally taken Jacob home . Fighter: Despite just 17lb, half of what he should weigh for his age, Jacob has finally come home . Jacob was transferred to Birmingham Children's Hospital where he received treatment on an enlarged liver and physiotherapy on a squashed foot. However, terror struck when Jacob was just 11 days old after he stopped breathing and his lips turned blue in his mum's arms following sedation for a blood transfusion. Fortunately, First Aider Miss Stanley reacted immediately and administered CPR to her newborn. She said: 'It was the most difficult moment to deal with throughout the last year. 'I gave him the kiss of life. It was an immediate reaction. My little boy needed help and I had air in my lungs and just gave it to him. 'I knew what I had to do and I did it. Him turning blue in my arms was horrendous.' A few weeks after he was born, doctors were stunned when scans revealed Jacob was suffering from the extremely rare condition JXG. The condition, which is normally benign, causes multiple orange coloured lesions to appear on the skin and without treatment can cause glaucoma and blindness. However, in Jacob's case the lesions were also growing inside his body, attacking his blood, bones, lungs and liver and causing jaundice. Jacob would need five key operations and two dialysis sessions to survive. He underwent a lung biopsy, a lymph node biopsy, laser eye surgery, the insertion of a Hickman line to administer drugs and two operations to correct hernias. Doctors also discovered Jacob suffers from retinopathy caused by his prematurity, the same eye condition as Stevie Wonder. For months, Jacob's nappy changes and feeds were interspersed with pediatric care, blood and platelet transfusions and countless checks and scans. But in that time he has amazed doctors with his incredible progress and, still weighing just 17lb, half of what he should weigh for his age, Jacob has finally come home. Miss Stanley said: 'Having him home is like winning the lottery but 10 times better. He is gorgeous.'","Jacob Reed's chances of survival were so slim, that before he was born doctors repeatedly told his mother Pippa Stanley, 26, that she should abort him ."
"Sexually-charged videos and explicit lyrics are so endemic in the pop industry that parents are unable to protect their children from them, a disturbing survey has revealed. More than four-fifths of mothers and fathers have caught young children repeating offensive words or phrases from songs without knowing what they mean. The tide of sexual and violent imagery means that by the age of ten more than half understood the raunchy references anyway. One in thirteen parents reported that they had caught their children copying Miley Cyrus' 'twerking' moves . Pop stars’ images push girls into being ‘sexual too soon’ according to two-thirds of parents and a similar proportion say boys expect women to have ‘unrealistic porn star bodies’. A quarter said boys thought women wanted men to be ‘into violence and gangsta culture’. The extent to which the pornification of pop has been normalised in children’s lives is demonstrated by the fact that a third of parents said their kids have acted out ‘porn-style dance moves’, such as pole-dancing. Lady Gaga's outfits on prime time shows such as the X-Factor have prompted complaints from parents, who believe they are not suitable for children . One in 13 also reported their children copying Miley Cyrus’s degrading ‘twerking’ performance at the MTV Video Music Awards in August. Three-quarters of adults attempt to shield their children from provocative music videos, many of which are freely available on television music channels during the day. But their efforts are undermined by lewd spectacles on what is supposed to be family viewing. Two-thirds said their children were exposed to unhealthy images on pre-watershed shows such as the X Factor - proving channels and regulators are out of step with the values of ordinary members of the public. Lady Gaga prompted more than 100 complaints to Ofcom last month after appearing on The X Factor dancing provocatively in underwear. ITV responded by saying her performance was not ‘inappropriate for the family audience’. It followed appearances by Rihanna and Christina Aguilera in skimpy clothes on the programme in 2010. Ofcom was criticised at the time for saying the performances were ‘at the very margin of acceptability’. Attempts to bleep out offensive lyrics on the television and radio are pointless because children often ask what the words are. Many find out anyway by talking to friends or hearing a purchased version that is uncensored. The extent of the problem was revealed in an online survey of more than 1,500 Netmums members with children under the age of 16. Almost nine in ten complained modern pop stars were ‘far more explicit’ than those from their own youth. Stars such as Miss Cyrus, Rihanna and . Lady Gaga send negative messages to youngsters, according to more than . two-thirds who young girls were learning to ‘flash your body and be . sexual to get noticed’. One in ten said it enforced the belief that . girls are ‘just sexual objects’. According to the study female stars such as Rhianna (pictured) promote a negative message to young girls . Only one in 50 parents agreed with pop acts’ claims that their behaviour is ‘empowering’. More than half said they were more like porn stars and a quarter believed artists - particularly female singers - were exploited by the music business. Parents singled out songs including Robin Thicke’s ‘Blurred Lines’, which has been banned by about 20 student unions for trivialising rape. Other bad influences include Rihanna’s ‘S&M’ and Nicki Minaj’s ‘Starships’.Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard said: ‘Modern parents aren’t prudes - they know sex sells. But there’s a strong feeling that things have gone too far now. ‘It’s toxic to tell young kids casual sex and violence are something to aspire to. Instead, if a star wants to make a statement, why not use their brain, not their body.’ The survey follows comments yesterday by the head of an exclusive boarding school who complained teenage girls were receiving damaging mixed messages from role models who ditch clean-cut images for raunchy personas. Jo Heywood, who runs £30,000-a-year Heathfield School in Ascot, Berkshire, highlighted the transformation of Miss Cyrus, who previously starred as a wholesome all-American teenager in Hannah Montana on the Disney Channel.","One in 13 parents caught their child imitating Miley Cyrus' 'twerking' moves .

FIFA's head of media Delia Fischer said: 'The ban relates to all football-related activity. He cannot be in a football-related public event irrespective of the venue. 'He cannot even be involved in a football-related charity event.' Suarez, 27, had his appeal against the four-month ban, plus a nine-match international and an 100,000 Swiss franc (£66,000) fine, rejected outright by FIFA's appeals committee. He is expected to take his appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in a final bid to reduce the sanctions that, as they stand, will keep him out of club football until the end of October. Name on the shirt: But Suarez can't be shown off to fans at the Nou Camp or elsewhere . Number nine: They might not be able to unveil him but Barcelona fans can already buy Suarez's shirt . Different: Neymar and Cesc Fabregas both underwent high profile unveilings at the Nou Camp . Suarez can also ask CAS to put his ban on hold pending their final decision but that would risk him missing more matches rather than a chunk of the close season if the court upholds the sanctions. Some 90,000 packed the Nou Camp stadium for the unveiling of Brazil forward Neymar in June 2013. FIFA's original ban took into account that Suarez had shown no remorse for the biting incident, his third such attack in less than four years. The player then did issue an official apology but it did not lead to any change of mind by the FIFA appeals panel. Suarez's lawyer on Friday claimed the punishment was 'blatantly draconian, totalitarian and fascist'. Alejandro Balbi told Spanish radio station Cope: 'The right of a footballer to work is being violated, and football should be worried about that. 'The nine (international) games may seem excessive, but the fact that he can't watch a game of football, or train or carry out his job, we are talking about unpleasant things.' Painful blow: Suarez's bite on Chiellini led to him getting his four-month ban from football-related activity .","Barca had planned to unveil new striker at a non-football venue .

"Nash Grier, 15, name may not be as well-known as Ellen Degeneres, Miley Cyrus, or Justin Bieber but the North Carolina teen has more followers than any of them Vine. Grier has taken around 125 of the 6-second, looping videos since April—a total of just 12 minutes of footage—but has already gained a following of 1.4 million. That makes the high school sophomore the 25th most followed person of the service’s over 40 million registered users after just over six months of posting videos, mostly of him and his friends in goofing off. Scroll down for video... Popular guy: Nash Grier is the 25th most popular user of video sharing app Vine. He's pictured here with his 4-year-old sister in a Vine, which like many features his family goofing off . Grier was a typical user with your average following of friends and family until July, when another high school Vine savant, Tiffiny Semashko of Arkansas, shared one of Nash’s vines with her 300,000 followers. Three weeks later, Grier’s account had reached 200,000 followers. ‘It just kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger and just hasn’t stopped,’ Grier told the Charlotte Observer. But asked what his secret is, Grier is likely at a loss. Goofing off: In about 6 months, Grier managed to gain 1.4 million followers on Vine with the help of hysterical videos like Stair Diving, which shows his brother crashing down a set of stairs in a baby pool while wearing football gear . It could be his penchant for making visual puns that spin off from youth culture. In one Vine, he cuts into Katy Perry’s Roar video and growls at the camera while holding a tiny purring kitten. The adorable factor may be at play. A Vine that guest stars Grier's 4-year-old sister Skylynn singing the Black Eyed Peas' Boom Boom Pow garnered 375,000 likes and 300,000 shares. Or perhaps its Grier’s ability to catch moments of kids just being kids, as he does in a Vine that features his 13-year-old brother Hayes cascading down their home’s staircase in full football padding while inside an empty baby pool. ‘Stair diving,’ Grier says to the camera as he suddenly appears in the frame. Whatever the recipe, it is a successful one. Grounded: Media firms eager to monetize the social media savant's success call him with offers almost daily, but his dad says he just wants 'Nash to be Nash' In addition to his impressive Vine following, Grier boasts 82,000 Twitter followers and a whopping 230,000 followers on Instagram. His success may also pay off financially. The teen has been approached by international media firms like London-based Viral Spiral, who imagine web series spinoffs and even merchandise in an attempt to monetize what is still basically a hobby. While Grier gets calls nearly every day from such companies, his dad Chad wold prefer his son remain a regular kid while he still can. ‘We’re going to have to put an end to it,’ Chad told the Observer. ‘I want Nash to be Nash.’ Recipe for success? 'Usually the dumber we look, the funnier it is,' Grier says .","Vine is a mobile video app that lets users make a share 6-second videos .

Investigators have ruled out foul play. 'There were neither signs of . fighting, nor robbery, but we found many kinds of . over-the-counter-drugs, including ibuprofen, which can cause serious . effects on the stomach,' police Lt Col Jongrak Pimthong said.

The annual two-day event has a wealth of 50, 60 and 70-year-olds eager to inject fitness into their golden years. Mr Cone was a bodybuilder in the 1980s but then he decided to beef up once again and won in the Southern States competition in his over-70 category.

By my Iooks alone, I hope that helps motivate seniors to get on their feet.' More than one-third of competitors posing this year were over the age of 40, a Southern States record, said Mr Potter. 'Outdoor activities are definitely more prevalent in South Florida than if you came from Detroit or Chicago or whatever,' he said.

"It has been 40 years since they were on our television screens – but those decades have done nothing to diminish our love of Monty Python. Last night thousands of fans – some dressed as their favourite Python characters – descended on London's O2 Arena for the comedy act's stage reunion. John Cleese, Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones – delighted their fans when they announced the comeback concerts last year. But did it live up to the hype? The show, which features an extended cast of dancers, an orchestra and special effects, includes numerous set changes and costs around £4.5million to stage. Last night it opened with a trademark animation featuring the face of the late Python Graham Chapman and Doctor Who’s ship – dubbed the ‘retardis’ – flying through space before the Pythons came on stage. One of the first classic sketches they performed was the four Yorkshiremen comparing their tough upbringing. The audience were also treated to clips from the old shows including the fish-slapping sketch. Palin got a great ovation for his performance of The Lumberjack Song complete with an advert inviting tourists to visit Canada for its ‘elks and exciting mayors’, while John Cleese treated the audience to The Spanish Inquisition sketch.

"It's the Spain squad no one watching the Premier League back in January would have thought  possible. Coach Vicente del Bosque named his 23 for Brazil yesterday and Juan Mata and Fernando Torres made the plane at the expense of Alvaro Negredo and Jesus Navas. ‘It breaks my heart to leave Navas behind,’ said Del Bosque. ‘But he has not been right for the past two months and I prefer to take someone who is 100 per cent.’ That criteria was not applied to Diego Costa. Spain’s Brazilian-born striker is struggling with the hamstring problem that reduced his participation in the Champions League final to just eight minutes. VIDEO: Scroll down to see how many efforts Torres needs to score . Singin' the Blues: Alvaro Negredo (L) and Jesus Navas didn't make Spain squad despite helping Manchester City win the title . Off the boil: 'The Beast' impressed in the first half of the season before struggling for form and fitness . But the top scoring ‘Spaniard’ in La Liga . last season is given extra time to get back to full fitness and his . place in the 23 was only ever going to leave two other striker berths. Del Bosque has opted for experience with David Villa and Torres in ahead . of Negredo. To overlook ‘The Beast’ Negredo would have been unthinkable at the turn of the year and reflects a  disastrous second half of the season for the Manchester City striker. He did not seem to be too upset by what was ultimately a widely  predicted omission, tweeting that he was off on holiday with model girlfriend Clara Garcia Tapia. Torres’s inclusion might baffle everyone outside of Spain but he is seen as a big occasion player, an excellent squad member and a favourite of Del Bosque, who has never been convinced by Negredo who he barely used at Euro 2012. Teacher's pet? Vincente Del Bosque has picked Ferando Torres despite another average season for Chelsea . Brazil bound: Atletico striker Diego Costa has been included in the final 23, despite recovering from injury . For Navas it represents a major disappointment after being an important squad player four years ago when Spain won the World Cup in South Africa. He came on against Holland in the final and it was his mazy run out of defence that led to Andres Iniesta’s extra-time  winning goal. He had tweeted just before the squad was announced: ‘Back fully fit and raring to go, ready to have a good World Cup.’ His absence means that both  Arsenal’s Santi Cazorla and Manchester United’s Mata made the cut. Special Juan: Manchester United playmaker Mata has booked his place on the plane to Brazil . Mata tweeted: ‘Couldn’t be happier, very proud to make the squad, let’s make history again.’ His season was the opposite of Negredo’s with an awful first half out in the cold under Jose Mourinho seeing him leave Stamford Bridge for Old Trafford. Del Bosque’s concerns never centred on Mata’s ability but on his amount of first-team action and the transfer yielded the playing time needed to join Cazorla in the squad. Despite the absence of the City pair there are 10 players in Del Bosque’s squad who perform, or have played, in the Premier League. All smiles: Torres is congratulated by teammates after scoring in Spain's 2-0 friendly win against Bolivia . Six of those should feature in Spain’s . opening fixture against Holland, with the holders likely to name Cesar . Azpilicueta at right-back in a defence that will include Gerard Pique, . Sergio Ramos and Jordi Alba; Koke, Xabi Alonso and Sergi Busquets in . midfield with Iniesta, David Silva and Cesc Fabregas in attack, the . former Arsenal captain operating as a false nine as he did in the last .

"The UK Independence Party today claimed it was on the verge of an electoral earthquake after storming to second place in the South Shields by-election. Labour held the seat vacated by former Foreign Secretary David Miliband, but UKIP doubled its vote share to 24 per cent, pushing the Tories into third and the Lib Dems slumping to a humiliating seventh just ahead of the Monster Raving Loony Party. UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall said his party was knocking on the door to Westminster and 'soon we will kick that door in'. Scroll down for video . UKIP surged into second place halving the Labour majority to less than 5,000 votes . Ricard Elvin's, right, UKIP came second while Lib Dem candidate Hugh Annand, left, came seventh . UKIP is also making big gains in local elections across England, taking votes from the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems. In South Shields, UKIP secured 24 per cent of the . vote as Labour's Emma Lewell-Buck held the seat with a reduced majority . of 6,505. The result proved . disastrous for the Liberal Democrats, who came seventh and lost their . deposit, and also bad for the Conservatives who picked up 11.5 per cent . of the vote. Mr Nuttall said: 'It shows we are a . party on an upward trajectory, that we are going places and it also . shows that we are not just a southern-based party taking votes from the . Conservatives, we are taking votes in the north as well. Emma Lewell-Buck (Lab) 12,493 . Richard Elvin (UKIP) 5,988 . Karen Allen (Conservative) 2,857 . Ahmed Khan (Ind) 1,331 .

The South Shields contest was . triggered by former foreign secretary David Miliband's decision to quit . politics and head to the United States to lead an international charity. Labour's majority was reduced from . the 11,109 achieved by Mr Miliband and the 50.5 per cent share of the vote was . the party's lowest in the safe seat since 1083. UKIP candidate Richard Elvin said: 'It's an absolutely fantastic result for UKIP. 'To come from nowhere to take 25 per cent at its first attempt is absolutely stunning. 'It's a message to all three mainstream parties that UKIP is the official opposition. We have proved that in Labour strongholds and we have done it again in South Shields.' David Miliband congratulated his successor in a message on Twitter. He wrote: 'Congrats @EmmaLewellBuck and Labour team in Southshields. Holding 50% of vote very good result.' The Labour winner, a married social worker, was cheered by supporters as she became the first female MP in South Shields. From the podium, she said: 'I will help get people back to work, champion our wonderful town and never give the Tory Government one moment's peace.' But Lib Dem Home Office minister Jeremy Browne said he thought the Labour winner's victory speech was 'stage-managed' and 'phoney'. He told BBC News: 'I was watching the Labour by-election winner from South Shields on television this morning and I have no bone to pick with her - I have never met her in my life - but it was the most stage-managed, phoney, inauthentic political display that you could ever see on television. ""She just repeated all the same mantras about millionaires and bedrooms and I thought, doesn't she have any views of her own? 'Why isn't the Labour Party letting her speak? Why isn't there any authenticity in this whole stage-managed occasion?' Mr Browne said the three main parties needed to respond to the UKIP surge by thinking 'a bit differently about how we do politics as well as the policies'. Celebrating: Labour candidate Emma Lewell-Buck gives a speech after winning the South Shields by-election . UKIP is on course to win 100 council seats after local elections were held across the country . BNP candidate Lady Dorothy Macbeth Brookes beat the Lib Dems' Hugh Annand, who finished seventh . Voters have gone to the polls in 34 . council contests across England, plus the Isle of Anglesey in Wales, . with an eligible electorate of around 40 per cent of the UK total. A UKIP source said 'we are expecting a . cracking night' and the party would 'triple or quadruple our vote from . 2009' when the council seats were last contested. The dire result for the Lib Dems is just the latest poor showing for the Nick Clegg's party which built its success on winning by-elections before joining the coalition. Its one notable success was clinging on in Eastleigh, but the other 13 by-elections contested since May 2010 make for grim reading:Oldham East and Saddleworth: 2nd (vote share +0.3%) Barnsley Central: 5th (-13.1%) Lost deposit . Leicester South: 2nd (-4.4%) Inverclyde: 4th (-11.1%) Lost deposit . Feltham and Heston: 3rd (-7.9%) Bradford West: 4th (-7.1%) Lost deposit .

Eastleigh: 1st (-14.5%) South Shields: 7th (-12.8%) Lost deposit) Nigel Farage's party became the second largest party in Lincolnshire as the Conservatives lost control of the authority. They . won 16 seats in Lincolnshire, 10 in Hampshire, nine in Essex, three in . Gloucestershire, three in Somerset and one in Dorset. Overnight counts took place at six authorities which were held by the Tories before the election. The . Conservatives retained control in Dorset, Essex, Hampshire and - . narrowly - Somerset, where they lost five seats and the Liberal . Democrats lost four. But . as well as in Lincolnshire, they were ousted from overall control in . Gloucestershire, where there were four gains for Labour and three for . UKIP. Labour's Norma . Redfearn ousted incumbent Tory Linda Arkley in the battle to be mayor of . North Tyneside. Results elsewhere will be announced later today. The father of Tory MP Priti Patel took second place standing under the UKIP banner in a Hertfordshire County poll. Sushil Kantibhai Patel was running under that party's description on the ballot paper at Bushey South. He came more than 1,200 votes behind Conservatives but ahead of Labour and Liberal Democrats. Last night Tory International Development . Secretary Justine Greening said UKIP did not have any 'substance' and . insisted the Government was listening to people's concerns. Appearing on BBC1's Question Time, . she said: 'I think as people take more of a look at UKIP they will be . able to form their own opinion about whether there is any substance . underneath the policies. 'I personally don't think that there is but I think it's up to voters to decide, obviously.' Deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman . told the programme UKIP's rise was a 'wake-up call' for the . establishment parties, but some of its politics were 'quite . threatening'. She said: 'We should listen very . seriously if people are feeling disaffected and disenchanted. It is a . challenge to us. It's a wake-up call for us to actually listen to people . who feel that times are hard and wonder whether any of us have actually . got the answers.' But she added: 'I don't take the easy . assumption 'Oh well, it's great because it's going to take votes off . the Conservatives'. 'I think some of their politics is quite threatening . and we shouldn't be complacent either.' Labour won the South Shields by-election but the result was marked by surge in the vote for UKIP . UKIP candidate Richard Elvin polled almost 6,000 votes, halving the Labour majority to only 5,000 . Lib Dem veteran Baroness Williams of Crosby told the programme UKIP would not 'last that long' as a political force. She said: 'I may be wrong, but I . think what they are doing essentially is trading on protest and they . don't have anything very solid to say about the problems that really . face the country.' After the win, the new MP Emma Lewell-Buck said: 'UKIP did make inroads but ultimately the people of South Shields have spoken and they want a Labour MP.' Her background in social work meant she had seen people living with poverty under a Labour government she said. 'I have seen how people live under a Coalition Government and are really struggling, and I want to make a difference.'","Labour's Emma Lewell-Buck wins safe seat with with 12,493 votes .

"A soft-touch judge who failed to jail a burglar who went on to commit 22 more raids has now cut his prison term. Career criminal Jason Reed - also a . convicted rapist - could have been jailed under the 'three-strikes' rule . after initially admitting 12 burglaries. But judge Carol Hagen, who has a history of leniency, instead gave him a suspended sentence to tackle his drug habit. Lenient: Judge Carol Hagen (left) who decided not to jail serial burglar Jason Reed (right) last year before he went on to commit a string of other raids has now cut his subsequent prison term after praising his co-operation with the police . Reed, 39, went on to burgle 22 more properties in the following nine months - even stealing a war hero's medals. Judge Hagen finally jailed him for six . years, but just weeks on has now slashed his sentence by a year - after . praising his 'co-operation' with the police. Addressing Reed, Judge Hagen said: 'On . reflection of the sentence, I felt that I  had given insufficient . weight to your co-operation and the effect that that has had on victims. 'I hope that will encourage others to come forward and say what they have done.' Judge Hagen opted out of jailing Reed - . convicted of rape in 2004 - last June despite admitting his fourth . burglary since the 'three-strikes' rule was introduced. Under the law, any adult burglar . convicted of their third domestic break-in should serve at least three . years in prison unless the court considered there to be 'exceptional . circumstances'. It was the 12th burglary on his criminal record at the time. Instead, Reed was handed a suspended three-year jail term along with a drug treatment order to help him kick his habit. But he was back before the court . earlier this month - admitting one burglary, one theft and asking for 49 . other break-ins over the past decade to be taken into consideration. Released: Reed could have been jailed at Bristol Crown Court (above) last year under the 'three-strikes' rule, but judge Hagen allowed him to walk free so he could kick his drug habit . Bristol Crown Court heard that 22 of the burglaries had taken place since June. The court was told Reed had smashed . into the home of brave Dr Dave Winfield, 39, a former Army doctor, and . stole two generations of war medals last November. The hero, from Long Ashton, Bristol, . was awarded the gongs for his service in some of the world’s fiercest . battle zones - Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo. He was also presented with a Queen’s Jubilee medal for his 17 years of long service. The honours, stolen along with those . belonging to his grandfather Thomas Winfield, who served in the Royal . Navy during the Second World War, have all since been returned. Judge Hagen finally jailed Reed for six years at Bristol Crown Court on April 3. After the sentence, Dr Winfield said: . 'If this man had been jailed back in June, it would have saved me a . whole lot of heartache. 'The needs of the victims are the most important in crimes like this and judges should think about them first.' But Reed was back in court on Thursday . under the ‘slip rule’, which gives the court the power to alter a . sentence within 56 days of it being made. The judge claimed she formed her view . after considering how police had written to her and said Reed had taken . them on 'drive rounds' and cleared up 49 unsolved burglaries. Police also confirmed remorseful Reed . had been doing well in his fight to get off drugs before relapsing and . had targeted homes he thought were unoccupied.","Judge Carol Hagen allowed Jason Reed to walk free after 12th burglary .

"From flapper dresses and fringes to feathers and finger curls, the 1920s was an era of opulence and post-war fashion fun. And it seems that the flamboyant style of the Jazz Age has returned, with a little help of Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby film. According to the latest study, high street stores have seen sales of vintage-inspired items soaring with one such store noting increases of up to 266 per cent. Flapper style: It seems that the flamboyant style of the 1920s Jazz Age has returned, with a little help of Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby film . High street giant Debenhams have seen a huge increase in sales of beaded capes, lace dresses, pearls and twenties style eveningwear. Sales of feather accessories such as capes and head pieces have increased by over 250 per cent, and eye-catching costume jewellery such as bold diamante encrusted bracelets and extravagant strings of large golden pearls are up 200 per cent compared to this time last year. Michelle Dowdall, Debenhams spokesman said: 'Twenties style regalia is back! Our customers are snapping up accessories and womenswear to get the Gatsby look - feminine, flapper style is fast becoming one of spring's hottest trends. 'The beauty of this trend is that women can go big or small. A simple feather and pearl hair clip gives a subtle nod to Gatsby, or for full-on twenties glamour, women can wear gorgeous sequined dresses with scalloped hems and lace by eveningwear designer Jenny Packham, accessorised with strings of pearls.' Bling bling: Sales of feather accessories such as capes and head pieces as seen on Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan have increased by over 250 per cent . Hair jewels and beaded capes favoured by Gatsby's love interest Daisy Buchanan have been popular with customers, with sales increasing by 73 per cent and 250 per cent respectively in the past week alone. Menswear is also seeing a Gatsby influence on sales, with tuxedo jackets and formal wear up 60 per cent versus this time last year. Michelle Dowdall added: 'With the opulent party dresses in the film adaptation of Scott Fitzgerald's novel provided by the likes of Prada, and tuxedos from Brooks Bros, it was inevitable that men and women would want to emulate the beautiful twenties fashions seen on set.'

"Body parts of British soldiers killed in Afghanistan have been secretly retained by the Army, the Mail can reveal. At least 60 items of human tissue, which should have been given to families for burial, were stashed away by the Royal Military Police. The Ministry of Defence last night admitted that material was retained without families being informed, and that officials are now seeking to contact those affected. Around six major body parts plus 54 samples of tissue on laboratory slides were discovered recently when a new manager was appointed at the headquarters of the Special Investigations Branch of the RMP. Concerning: British soldiers from B Company, 2 Mercian wait for a helicopter before leaving on an operation in Malgir, Helmand province in 2009 . The parts were found at John . Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, and the slides in SIB headquarters at . Campion Lines barracks at Bulford garrison on Salisbury Plain in . Wiltshire. Military sources say the find is . evidence of systematic abuse of rules which govern the way body parts . are handled when forensic investigations are carried out on the bodies . of soldiers. MoD sources said the parts needed to . be kept as part of investigations where the SIB need to ‘match . ballistics’ and for the purposes of ‘identifying people in the future’ – . which may refer to matching future body part finds. But . a military whistleblower said: ‘These have been retained illegally for . no good purpose and should have been buried with their owners. ‘There is a strict procedure for accounting for body parts needed for forensic testing, and this has clearly been ignored; it is likely that coroners and pathologists have been misled as well.’ The number of families and soldiers affected is smaller than 60 since multiple samples of human tissue have been retained in each case. Worry: Lord Dannatt, the former head of the Army, said the allegations were 'concerning' But MoD officials admit they do not know exactly how many servicemen are involved. An Army spokesman said: ‘There are occasions when it is necessary for the RMP Special Investigations Branch to retain slides of forensic material from individuals killed on operations as part of their investigation. ‘However, the RMP identified a small number of cases where this had been done without the correct processes being followed to inform families. ‘Investigations are being carried out urgently into this matter. The RMP Special Investigations Branch has also taken swift action to ensure this cannot happen again and are identifying the families affected as quickly as possible.’ The body parts were retained during the tenure of Sergeant-Major Andrew Bishop, who was made an MBE for services to forensic science. MoD officials said he is now leaving the Army on a medical discharge having suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after attending multiple post-mortem examinations at Bulford. But whistleblowers say some responsibility also lies with Colonel Len Wassell, who was commanding officer of the Special Investigations Branch between October 2008 and August 2010. Insiders say Colonel Wassell was Sergeant-Major Bishop’s direct superior and should have supervised procedures for the proper handling of any body parts needed for forensic testing. The MoD would not say whether any disciplinary action has been taken. But Lord Dannatt, the former head of the Army, said: ‘If there are individuals responsible for allowing this type of thing to happen they must certainly be held to account. ‘Allegations like these are very serious and there must be an investigation. Everything must be done to see that this type of thing cannot be allowed to happen.’ Major General Patrick Cordingley, commander of the Desert Rats in the 1991 Gulf War, said: ‘It is the most tragic mistake and it will cause deep distress to families who have lost loved ones in Afghanistan.’ Shadow Armed Forces Minister Kevan Jones said: ‘This is shocking and offensive. People will be aghast that heroic service personnel could be treated in this way. ‘We must be given the full details of what has happened. If there has been a cover-up the truth must be exposed and we must establish if any law has been broken.

"An American anchor who quit her job at state-funded Russia Today on air to protest President Vladimir Putin sending troops into the Ukraine has said she 'feels sick' that she worked at the station. Liz Wahl, who works at RT's Washington, DC bureau, said in her live resignation that she could no longer work for a network that 'whitewashes the actions of Putin'. She has now further explained her reasons for quitting the channel, saying it is 'not a sound news organization, not when your agenda is making America look bad.' Scroll down for video . Connecticut-born Liz Wahl who sensationally quit her job at state-funded Russia Today on air earlier this month has spoken out for the first time about her bold decision and how the channel's coverage of events in Ukraine that was the final straw for her . Putin has justified the incursion into . Crimea as a way of protecting ethnic-Russians in the region who he says . are threatened by 'ultra-nationalistic forces' as the country undergoes . revolution. In her resignation, Wahl spoke about how personal the recent developments in the Ukraine are to her. Wahl's grandparents emigrated to the United States from Hungary during that country's revolution in 1956 because of the threat of Soviet forces. 'I'm proud to be an American and believe in disseminating the truth. And that is why after this news cast I'm resigning,' Wahl signed off. In an interview with the Daily Beast, Wahl said the Kremlin's influence over RT was not overt but 'in order to succeed there you don't question'. She said: 'In a way you kind of suppress any concerns that you have and play the game.' Wahl goes on to say: 'It actually makes . me feel sick that I worked there. It’s not a sound news organization, . not when your agenda is making America look bad.' Wahl has accused the state-funded Russia Today of deliberately smearing America in order to make the Kremlin - and Putin - look good . Second: Wahl's resignation happened after fellow American RT anchor Abby Martin spoke out on TV to say the incursion on Crimea was 'wrong' Following Wahl's resignation, the network responded with a statement posted on their website. 'When . a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her . organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances . with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a . professional. But when someone makes a big public show of a personal . decision, it is nothing more than a self-promotional stunt. We wish Liz . the best of luck on her chosen path,' the statement read. But Wahl isn't the first American to call out RT. On Tuesday, anchor Abby Martin also spoke out against the Crimean incursion on the network. An armed man in military uniform sits atop of a Russian 'GAZ Tigr' infantry mobility vehicle outside the territory of a Ukrainian military unit outside Simferopol, Crimea . A Russian soldier looks through the sights of his weapon as Ukrainian servicemen wait at Belbek airport . 'I . can't say enough how strongly I am against any state intervention in a . sovereign nation's affairs. What Russia did is wrong,' Martin said. After . that outburst, Martin's bosses told the National Journal that they . would be sending her to Crimea 'to give her an opportunity to make up . her own mind from the epicenter of the story'. After the story was published, Martin responded on Twitter, saying she would not be going to the Crimea, despite RT's statement. As of Wednesday, Martin is still employed at the network.","Anchor Liz Wahl quit her job on live TV Wednesday to protest Russian President Vladimir Putin's incursion on Ukraine .

"Hull defender Liam Rosenior is unsurprised to see manager Steve Bruce linked with the Newcastle job. Geordie Bruce has already been touted as a possible replacement for Alan Pardew despite the latter still being in a job at St James' Park. Defeat at home to Hull on Saturday in front of what is expected to be a hostile Magpies crowd might weaken Pardew's grasp still further, while also strengthening Bruce's hand. Hull City defender Liam Rosenior (left) vies with Stoke City's Spanish striker Bojan Krkic . Steve Bruce, manager of Hull, has been linked with a possible job at Newcastle United . Alan Pardew is under increasing pressure at Newcastle United following a poor start to the season . For his part, the former Sunderland boss has shown no interest in the post he turned down in 2004 and has repeatedly labelled any such speculation 'disrespectful' to both Hull and Pardew. But Rosenior sees it as a mark of his success at the KC Stadium, where Bruce has overseen an unlikely promotion, an even unlikelier run to the FA Cup final and a brief dalliance with the Europa League in two whirlwind years. 'It's no surprise to me or anyone around here (to see speculation about Bruce). The manager has been fantastic ever since he walked in the front door,' said Rosenior. 'He's been a breath of fresh air through the club. There's only four or five of us left from before he arrived. It's been a great journey and he's now bringing in £10million centre forwards and England internationals. That shows what a great job he's done. 'It's no surprise to me that other teams will be interested in his services.' Bruce's Sunderland history, and his own taunts at the hand of Newcastle fans down the years, make a move to Tyneside a tricky sell, but Rosenior also thinks the spirit he has fostered in East Yorkshire would be hard to let go. 'In football anything can happen, but the manager is a fantastic guy and a great manager and whatever happened it's been a pleasure playing for him,' Rosenior added. Some supporters have given up on watching their team and decided to not renew cheap season tickets . Newcastle United owner  Ashley (centre) is being encouraged by fans to wield the axe and sack Pardew . 'There's a respect and a bond there. If you look at all the great teams of the past like Manchester United, Chelsea and Barcelona, although I'm not comparing us to them, there's a bond between the staff and the players that makes you successful. 'That's what we've got here. 'Why would I want to lose one of, if not the, most important part of something that's been so successful?' Rosenior also attempted to downplay with humour the reunion between Pardew and David Meyler. Pardew was banned for seven matches last season for headbutting the Tigers midfielder on the touchline. I think (David) is going to take his boxing gloves up there just in case!,' said a joking Rosenior. 'It was an unfortunate incident and goes to show how much people care. It got out of hand. 'But it's not about the sideshows. The important thing is going up there to win the game.' Newcastle United protest group 'SackPardew.com' have parodied owner Mike Ashley's Sports Direct logo .

"Alan Pardew has warned his Newcastle players they could be substituted early if they fail to handle what promises to be a poisonous atmosphere inside St James’ Park. The United boss is bracing himself for a mass supporter protest against his management of the team. One group – SackPardew.com – have printed 35,000 A4 cards calling for him to be sacked. Pardew is concerned that such a toxic atmosphere will spread to the pitch. Newcastle United protest group 'SackPardew.com' have parodied owner Mike Ashley's Sports Direct logo . Alan Pardew has vowed to hook any Newcastle players who struggle with the St James' Park atmosphere . And, to that end, he admits he could be forced to withdraw players affected by unrest in the stands. ‘I would not say this is a normal negative game. I think it is a little more than that,’ said Pardew ahead of the visit of Hull City. ‘I have tried to express to the players that this is a place where emotions run high. ‘It’s an emotional crowd which relays itself on to the pitch. The players are going to have to deal with it. ‘I don’t really know the answer to what they are going to be like. I will look for players who I think are struggling with the situation, more so to protect them. It may well be that at half-time, I make an early change. ‘It might be that the situation has got too much for that individual player, not because he is necessarily playing poorly.’ Newcastle are bottom of the Premier League heading in to the game and owner Mike Ashley has given Pardew no guarantees over his future, although Sportsmail understands his job is safe in the short term at least. Papiss Cisse could be in the line to play some part as the Magpies host Hull City on Saturday . French midfielder Remy Cabella takes a free kick during a training session on Friday . It was during the final home game of last season – a 3-0 win over Cardiff – that fans hissed their disapproval every time Pardew ventured in to his technical area. And he said: ‘That was the first time I have ever experienced that. As a manager, you have to use your knowledge and resolve to deal with certain situations. ‘I had some really testing times last season, as we know. ‘But it can also make you stronger - it can make the players stronger too. We have talked about the Cardiff game and coming through that. We knew before that game how much pressure there would be.’ Pardew, though, is in bullish mood ahead of the game and even found time to share a joke before outlining his determination to stay in the job. ‘Of course (I’m bracing myself). You don’t expect me to wave to the crowd and say, “Hi everyone, I’m happy, how are you today?”. That’s not happening,’ he went on. Pardew had this pair of official club pictures taken of him during a photocall earlier in the week . ‘I’m not nervous at the moment and I’m not in fear of it either. That’s not an ego or an arrogance thing, that’s just the way I am wired. ‘I kind of want the game now, I want to play it. I want to get it done and I want to get a win.’ Meanwhile, Pardew will come face to face with David Meyler for the first time since headbutting the Hull midfielder in March. His actions cost him a £100,000 club fine, £60,000 FA fine and a seven-game touchline ban, which included three matches excluded from the stadium. But Pardew said: ‘Obviously I have had to change. It is an incident I apologised for and regretted. ‘I have not seen him since. I will shake his hand and I am sure he will smile at me. It is something I’d like to think that I have learnt from.’","Newcastle manager Alan Pardew is facing a tricky atmosphere on Saturday .

"Beneath all that fur, she  may have the healthy glow of an expectant mum... but things are seldom that black and white with panda pregnancy. So Tian Tian, Britain’s only female giant panda, was placed under 24-hour surveillance – and her keepers put on ‘red alert’ – yesterday after tests suggested she is expecting. Any new arrival  would be the first panda cub to be born here. Scroll down for videos . The 10 year-old panda could give birth at any point over the next two weeks . Such . are the quirks of the species’ biology, however, that nobody yet knows . for certain if she is pregnant, so keepers will be looking out for signs . that she is about to go  into labour, such as restless behaviour  and . bleating. They even have . access to CCTV footage via their smartphones and laptops so they can . monitor her from their homes to ensure they don’t miss a beat. If . Tian Tian, whose name means Sweetie, is carrying a baby, the . pitter-patter of tiny paws could be heard any time in the next two weeks . – and it might even be twins. As . excitement grew yesterday at perhaps the most anticipated birth since . Prince George’s, she seemed to revel in keeping everyone guessing. Tian Tian has been relaxes  in her 'off show area' at Edinburgh Zoo today after experts announced there is a high chance she is pregnant . She . even stuck her tongue out at the crowds at Edinburgh Zoo, where she . lives with partner Yang Guang, whose name means Sunshine (he wasn’t . revealing much either, just eating bamboo and sleeping a lot as usual). Visitor . Hermione Taylor, 22, from London, said: ‘She looked so serene, and it . looked like she was smiling. Then she stuck her tongue out. It was as if . she was saying, “I’m giving nothing away”.’ Pandas . are notoriously picky about mating and, unfortunately, sparks failed to . fly between Tian Tian and Yang Guang, both aged eight, following their . arrival in 2011 after a 5,000-mile flight from China, which is loaning . them to Britain. They will stay at the zoo until 2021 and are expected to generate £47million in tourist income for the Scottish economy. The female giant panda rests at Edinburgh zoo today in preparation for what could be the first birth of a giant panda in the UK . But . under the agreement that brought them here, any cubs are the property . of the People’s Republic of China and will be taken to China at the age . of two, the age they would naturally leave their mother in the wild. Tian . Tian was artificially inseminated in April using some of Yang Guang’s . sperm, and some frozen sperm from Bao Bao, a ‘genetically important’ member of their endangered species who died at Berlin Zoo last year. Panda . foetuses do not start to develop until the final weeks of  the . five-month gestation period, and at birth the cubs weigh on average only . 5oz – 1/900th of their mother’s weight – so there is nothing so  simple . as a ‘baby bump’ to judge a pregnancy by. There is a chance Tian Tian, seen roaming her Edinburgh Zoo enclosure today, could reject the foetuses or that her body could reabsorb them . Yang Guang enjoys his free time at Edinburgh Zoo while Tian Tian, who is possible pregnant, rests in her 'off show area' After Yang Guang and Tian Tian failed to mate naturally, experts artificially inseminated the female giant panda with Yang Guang's semen so the cub or cubs will still be his . Instead, . tests on Tian Tian’s urine revealed a high level of the hormone . progesterone. This indicates she is pregnant, a zoo spokesman said, but . it could equally mean she is undergoing a ‘phantom pregnancy’. The . spokesman added that even if she is pregnant there is a possibility she . may not carry to full term and her body may reject any foetuses.

Vlad fans: Anastasia Petrova, Anastasia Trusova, Irina Volodchenko and  Margarita Bocharova show their support for the Russian president with their Putinkinis . ‘Our wonderful girls decided not to hide their patriotism and show a photo of V.V Putin as one of their attributes - on their breasts,’ explained the event's website.

"Everton boss Roberto Martinez felt his side showed great character to secure a 1-1 draw with FK Krasnodar that he believes will serve as a 'very good lesson' for them. The Toffees were second best for much of the Europa League Group H clash at the Kuban Stadium. But they emerged with a point after veteran striker Samuel Eto'o - the ex-Anzhi Makhachkala player, back on Russian soil - notched a late equaliser. Roberto Martinez was delighted that Everton managed to salvage a Europa League draw in Russia . Eto'o stabbed in Leighton Baines' cross in the 82nd minute to cancel out Ari's 43rd-minute goal for the hosts, who created the bulk of the chances and came close to making it 2-0 when substitute Wanderson hit the bar in the second half. Having seen his team achieve what he described as an 'incredible result', Martinez said: 'Today gave us a lot of experience. 'It has been a very good lesson for us. 'I think anything you can get away from home is a positive. 'But Krasnodar played really well. 'I thought we couldn't find our attacking rhythm in the first half. 'In the second half, Romelu (Lukaku, a half-time substitute) helped us. 'I think in the end we deserved it. 'I was delighted with the character that we showed.' He added: 'I thought Krasnodar adapted well in the first half, better than us, and probably we then finished stronger. Samuel Eto'o equalised for Everton late on to secure a draw for his side against Krasnodar . 'Maybe a draw is a fair result, but Krasnodar did have a lot of chances they couldn't take and it could have been a different story.' Martinez admitted before the game that he had tried to make the most during his preparations of the knowledge of Eto'o and Everton's former Spartak Moscow winger Aiden McGeady about Krasnodar - a club only formed in 2008. Both players came into the team among five changes the manager made ahead of Sunday's Premier League trip to Manchester United. Eto'o, 33, has not only tasted Russian football before, he has a vast experience playing in European competition. Eto'o escaped his marker to poke the ball home after Krasnodar had opened the scoring through Ari . And of the three-time Champions League-winner, Martinez said: ""Today was a bit of an unknown and we needed the experience. ""Samuel was waiting for that moment, was very composed, he got in good pockets of space and the finish was of the highest quality. I was delighted for him. ""The big thing about Samuel Eto'o is experience in European competition, and if anyone was going to have a chance and score a goal, it was going to be him. ""That was his role today - he used his experience and know-how. ""He came up with the goal and that is why he proved his value. ""I couldn't be prouder of his performance in terms of showing how to wait for your moment and then using it."" Everton, who are having their first European campaign since 2009/10, now have four points from two Group H games and remain top of the pool. Krasnodar and Lille have two points apiece, while Wolfsburg - defeated 4-1 by Everton last month - have one.","Samuel Eto'o scored for Everton as they drew 1-1 against Krasnodar .

"Sensitive discussions between Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Prime Minister Tony Abbott were conducted over secure phone lines and were not monitored, the prime minister has confirmed. The assurance was made in the wake of reports that Ms Bishop's mobile phone was hacked while she was dealing with the MH17 tragedy overseas. The Herald Sun said Australian intelligence officials seized the phone when she returned from a trip negotiating access to the MH17 crash site in the Ukraine. Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was downed in eastern Ukraine last month, killing 298 passengers and crew. Scroll down for video . Julie Bishop this week accused Russia of trying to shift people and equipment into eastern Ukraine by claiming there was a humanitarian crisis in the area .

The phone was not used to discuss sensitive communications and was replaced. Mr Abbott said he hadn't discussed this with Ms Bishop. 'It's well known that some countries do seek to, I suppose, target the phones of significant members of the Australian government.

The hacking report comes after Russia's foreign ministry hit out at Ms Bishop, labeling her comments on the Russian aid convoy to Ukraine as 'absurd' and 'irresponsible'. Ms Bishop this week accused Russia of trying to shift people and equipment into eastern Ukraine by claiming there was a humanitarian crisis in the area. But the suggestion that the several hundred trucks headed for eastern Ukraine could be a pretext for military intervention reportedly frustrated Russia's foreign ministry. A statement from the Russian government department said that 'burdened by their own oversized ambitions, some members of the current Australian Government have completely lost an adequate picture of the developments in Ukraine', Itar-Tass news agency reports. 'They keep making absurd statements that the humanitarian convoy to help civilians in the south-east of Ukraine can be used as a pretext for Russia’s ‘armed invasion’ of the neighbouring country, . 'Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has gone farther than others in making irresponsible innuendoes against our country even though one would think that her position presupposes building bridges between countries, not destroying them.' Australia has imposed sanctions against Russian officials and companies over the current situation in Ukraine. A convoy of 280 trucks is currently on its way from Russia to Ukraine. The trucks are carrying 2,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid, including 400 tonnes of cereal, 100 tonnes of sugar and 62 tonnes of baby food. There's also 54 tonnes of medical equipment, 12,000 sleeping bags and 69 generators headed Ukraine's way.","Foreign Minister Julie Bishop's phone was hacked overseas, report claims .

"A 22-year-old woman's suicide should be re-examined, forensic experts said this week after finding flaws with the initial investigation. Sheena Morris was found hanged in a . Florida hotel room on New Year's Day 2009, hours after she reportedly . fought with her 48-year-old fiancé Joe Genoese. A closed-door review panel met last month to go over the  Bradenton Beach police investigation into her death. A final decision on whether Miss Morris's suicide will be re-examined is down to the local chief of police. Case reopened: Sheena Morris, 22, was believed to have committed suicide in 2009 but now a panel of forensic experts have recommended her death be re-investigated . Miss Morris's mother Kelly Osborn has . refused to accept her daughter took her own life three years ago and . has relentlessly pursued the belief that someone murdered her. Ms Osborn . has continually criticized the police work and hired her own team of . private investigators, claiming that her daughter's death was staged. The panel of 15 experts, assembled by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, were not involved with the original case. Detective Lenard Diaz, who investigated originally, presented his case to the group, according to the Herald Tribune. After going over evidence and reviewing witness . accounts from the tragic death, the panel recommended the case be reopened. However the final decision lies with Bradenton Beach Police Chief Sam Speciale who has declined requests to reopen the case in the past. In August, Chief Speciale said he . would work with the task force but that crime scene evidence still . pointed to a suicide and he stood by that verdict. However he added: 'If (the team) looks at it and finds . something that we didn’t see, or that the other agencies didn't see, . that's great. That's why we're here.' Rocky relationship: Sheena, 22, and her 48-year-old boyfriend Joe Genoese had allegedly had a domestic dispute in the hours before her death . Investigation: The parents of Miss Morris have accused police of botching the investigation into her death at the Bridge Walk Resort on Anna Maria Island . Ms Osborn and Sheena's father David Morris, have long believed that their daughter was killed and the hanging in the bathroom at Bridge Walk Resort on Anna Maria Island staged. She told Fox News: 'The shower was dusted. There were no fingerprints, not even hers.' Prior to Miss Morris's body being found, guests in the next room had dialed 911 around 1am on January 1 to . report a domestic disturbance from the couple's hotel room. Mr Genoese then reportedly left the hotel and returned to his apartment in Tampa, an hour's drive away. According . to the account on the family's website, Justice4sheena.com, Miss Morris called the police department . close to her home in Hillsborough County at 2am because she wanted officers to check it over. In a taped recording, a young woman's voice can be heard saying that he was 'going to ruin her apartment because she ruined his life'. Mystery: Questions have been raised by a panel of forensic experts over the suicide of 22-year-old Sheena Morris . Tragedy: Sheena Morris's parents have never believed that their daughter committed suicide and have campaigned relentlessly for the investigation into her death to be reopened . Some 13 hours later, hotel staff heard Miss Morris's dogs barking in her hotel room and called police. Her body was discovered in the bathroom. Her fiancé Joe Genoese was not named as a person of interest in Miss Morris's death as the tenant of his Tampa apartment, Marcos Claudio had seen him that night. However in April, Mr Claudio said he could not be sure of the exact time he saw Mr Genoese as he had been drinking on New Year's Eve. The chief medical examiner for the . Florida district changed the 26-year-old's cause of death from suicide . to undetermined, as the theory that her death may have been staged . destabilized his original verdict. The . cold case team, which was not reopening but 'reviewing' the suicide . according to police, will make its findings in around two months.

"Back to basics: David Cameron will attempt to settle Tory nerves in the wake of today's election results by vowing to focus on the economy and immigration . David Cameron will attempt to settle Tory nerves in the wake of today’s election results by vowing to focus on the economy and immigration. Nanny-state measures unpopular with traditional Tories – including plans for a minimum price for alcohol and plain cigarette packs – have been ditched from next week’s Queen’s Speech. As UKIP last night appeared on course for its best showing in a Commons by-election and local polls, legislation allowing the State to record people’s internet and social media use, dubbed a ‘snooper’s charter’ and opposed by the Liberal Democrats and 40 Tory MPs, is also being shelved. Instead, several Bills aimed at boosting economic growth, and one which will limit the right of immigrants to access benefits, the NHS and other public services, will be at the heart of the Government’s future programme. The Prime Minister’s chief rival,  London Mayor Boris Johnson, yesterday urged him also to ‘ram home the message’ that he will call a referendum on Britain’s place in the EU by backing legislation that would enshrine his promise in law. In an apparent attempt to appease his backbenchers and help neutralise the UKIP threat, Mr Cameron suggested he was open to the idea of legislation to convince voters he will keep his pledge to hold an in/out vote by 2018 if he stays in power. Mr Johnson said: ‘I think it’s very important that there should be clarity in people’s minds, that we don’t have a repeat of the situation we had with the Lisbon Treaty where we thought we were going to get a referendum and then it was somehow whisked off the table. ‘So I’m sure the Prime Minister and the Government are absolutely sincere in their pledge to have a referendum. It’s going to happen, but maybe just to ram that message home, some legislation would be a good idea.’ Such legislation would not be brought forward by the Government, since the Lib Dems refuse to back it. Instead, the Conservative leadership would support a backbench Bill which would throw down the gauntlet to Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg, who would take a big risk by voting against a referendum which enjoys strong public support. Optimistic: UKIP last night appeared on course for its best showing in a Commons by-election and local polls. Its leader, Nigel Farage, relaxes during a visit to Ramsey in Cambridgeshire while on the local election campaign trail . Labour was last night confident of holding South Shields, one of its  safest Parliamentary seats, but expected UKIP to dent its performance with a strong second place and push the Lib Dems into a humiliating fourth. In local elections across the country, UKIP was hitting the Conservatives in their shire heartlands, and was expected to come close to matching the Labour share of the vote. Sources in all three of the main parties said they expected the anti-EU party to do better than ever before in both the town and country elections and in South Shields. The strong UKIP showing in South Shields, which has been Labour since the 1920s and was held by David Miliband from 2001 until he announced he was quitting Parliament in March, suggests it represents a serious threat to all parties. A UKIP source said: ‘We expect at the very least to give Labour a bloody nose in South Shields while giving the Conservatives a bloody nose in the rural leafy shires of England.’ There is growing concern in Labour ranks that UKIP appears to be scooping up the protest votes that would be expected to come to the main opposition party in the mid-term of a relatively unpopular Government. Tory HQ said it expected to see 400 or more councillors swept away. The party had expected big losses, since the seats contested yesterday were last fought in 2009, at the nadir of Gordon Brown’s government. Overall, UKIP expects to pick up about 100 seats.","Measures unpopular with .

"Fame can bring a lot of things - money, fast cars and mansions. But you know you've hit the big time when you have been transformed into a doll. The One Direction boys were in Los Angeles this week to launch their new and updated figurines.

And the dolls have proved to be a huge success in America selling out as soon as they hit the shelves. However, they are only available in U.S. Meanwhile, Louis Tomlinson, 21, Zayn Malik, 20, Harry Styles, Liam Payne and Niall Horan, all 19, have been splashing the cash during their time in Los Angeles forking out £17,500 to stay in a Hollywood Hills mansion to celebrate the end of the U.S. part of their world tour which was a sell-out. Merchandise: One Direction band members Niall Horan and Harry Styles pose with their dolls . The six bedroom house looks like a cruise ship from the front and has a 46ft swimming pool, two hot tubs, eight bathrooms, panoramic views, a bar, disco, sauna and two kitchens. So while they're not on stage at the Staples Center for their last few concerts before heading to Australia, the British boys will be living it up in the exclusive pad which boasts breathtaking views across the city. Proving just how much money they are now raking in, just three years after being on the ITV singing contest, the youngsters are hardly being frugal, preferring to live it up in unrivalled opulence. The decision to rent the lavish home, which is nestled far away from the city, may have something to do with the fact that the boys have been causing quite a stir while in the US. Cinemas showing the documentary 1D: This Is Us, have reportedly been asked to step up their security after having to deal with stampedes of fans, even though the boys aren't there in person. The band have been looking far from exhausted despite the fact that they've been spending almost all of their time on the road recently, giving their usual high-energy performances at their gigs. And they haven't got long left to go as after six weeks off, they will flying to Australia for the last leg of the world tour, finishing off in Melbourne on October 30.

"Racism in English football is overt - and highlighted by the struggles of Chelsea youth coach Eddie Newton to secure a managerial job, FIFA's anti-discrimination chief has claimed. Jeffrey Webb, who is also a FIFA vice-president and head of the confederation covering the Caribbean, North and central America, insists the problem is not behind the scenes and is 'right in front of your face', and encouraged English football to adopt the Rooney rule used in NFL. Webb told the Leaders in Sport conference in London: 'I don't know how it could be hidden. You have 92 clubs, you have two coaches of colour. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho insist there is no racism in football . Jeffrey Webb highlighted the struggles of Chelsea youth coach Eddie Newton (left) to secure a managers job . 'How many board members or executives are in various club positions or at the FA, in UEFA? So, it's not hidden.' Jeffrey Webb is FIFA's anti-discrimination chief, and says England's problem is extremely overt . Webb also said the experience of former Chelsea assistant manager Newton had hammered home to him the depth of the problem. Newton was assistant manager under Roberto di Matteo when Chelsea won the Champions League in 2012, but Webb said he is now struggling even to get an interview as a manager. Newton, also former assistant manager at West Brom, is still employed by Chelsea as a technical coach on their youth development programme. 'I hosted a dinner a few months ago, last time I was here. I met a young guy coaching at Chelsea, who was assistant coach and won a Champions League final, doing well. 'He can't even get an interview, Eddie Newton. I'm not talking about getting a job, getting an interview. That's not hidden. That's right in front of your face.' Webb said the time had come for English football to embrace affirmative action such as the NFL's Rooney rule, which obliges clubs to include an ethnic minority candidate on shortlists for all coaching positions. Webb added: 'In this day and time, in this era, in this century, should we really be having to mandate opportunities for qualified individuals? Sadly, the answer is yes.' PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor said last week the lack of black coaches underlined 'hidden' racism within the game. Huddersfield boss Chris Powell is one of just two black managers in the top  four divisions of English football . The NFL employs the Rooney rule to address the issue of a lack of coaches from minority backgrounds . Webb said American owners of English clubs could help push through change. He said: 'It's hidden from a discussion standpoint. No-one wants to deal with it. No-one wants to deal with it from a commercial standpoint. 'It has to come within. It has to come from the clubs. It has to start with clubs. It has to start with ownership. 'How many American owners do we have from English Premier League clubs in the UK? 'So, why have certain standards here and then, of course, in the US, in the NFL leagues, where you live, where you conduct business, you live by different standards? Why? 'If it's good there, why wouldn't it be good here?' Rio Ferdinand is open to the rule, which promotes the hiring of more black and ethnic minority coaches . Webb added that there was a 'huge challenge' with the next World Cup taking place in Russia, which has been the scene for numerous incidents of racism in football. UEFA last week ordered CSKA Moscow to play three European matches behind closed doors after racist incidents involving fans. The PFA and Kick It Out have both pressed for the Rooney rule to be introduced in English football, but the authorities have so far resisted the move. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said there was 'no racism in football' when asked for his view of the Rooney rule last week.","Racism in English football is overt, according to Jeffrey Webb .

One of his most famous photos is at Big Allo Lake, a difficult point to reach in Tajikistan's  Fann Mountains, shows the spectacular peaks reflected in the water . However, it was only after a memorable trip to the Fann Mountains of Tajikistan did he come up with the idea of photographing views from inside his tent. Whether danging his bare feet above the waters of Big Allo Lake, 3150m above sea level, or snapping nearly impossible-to-get shots of the highest point of the Fann Mountains, Grigoriev photographs views rarely seen by even the most adventurous of campers. In fact, he was the first Russian person to reach the snow covered landscape of the Fann Mountains' 5489m Chimtarga peak. Usually travelling in a group of 10 to 15 people, Oleg has pitched his tent in the mountains of the Caucasus in Russia, the Karpaty in Ukraine and the Kazbek in Georgia. Grigoriev has also travelled to Georgia, Ukraine, and Russia on the search for these awe-inspiring snaps and perfect morning views . At Lake Alaudin, also in the Fann Mountains, the adventurous explorer admired this stunning vista . 'I like to travel to remote places where there is no hotel or hostel, so I take a tent with me to the mountains to sleep in,' he said. 'I love the great outdoors and travelling, especially to the mountains.' 'It's a very emotive experience for me which I try to express in my photos,' he explained. Grigoriev also hopes his gorgeous photos inspire others to get out there and travel. 'I like to think they motivate people to not be a conformist when it comes to picking holiday destinations.'

"David Meyler will accept Alan Pardew’s apology when the pair come face to face for the first time since the Newcastle boss headbutted him in March. Pardew will seek out the Hull midfielder at St James’ Park on Saturday afternoon and offer him his hand – rather than his brow – in an effort to make up with the Republic of Ireland international. Meyler will be only too happy to shake hands with the United manager, insisting he wasn’t fazed by the incident. David Meyler will accept Alan Pardew’s apology when the pair come face to face on Saturday afternoon . Newcastle United manager Pardew headbutted Hull City midfielder Meyler last season . Meyler says that he will accept Pardew's apology when the pair come face to face on Saturday . ‘What's the point of me dwelling on it? It's done, it's dusted,’ he said. ‘I come from a big GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) background, I played a lot of hurling and Gaelic football growing up as a kid and you used to get belted as a kid all the time. ‘That's just the way it was. I used to live and breathe that. You would go home and your hands would be cut, your legs would be cut. ‘I was more annoyed because we lost 4-1. I flew home with my father and we never spoke about it once. We spoke about the game. The incident was nothing. You've got to move on. You can't keep thinking about it.’ Newcastle were leading 3-1 at the KC Stadium when Meyler attempted to retrieve the ball from in front of the visiting dugout, only to be confronted by Pardew. His actions cost him a £100,000 club fine, £60,000 FA fine and a seven-game touchline ban, which included three matches excluded from the stadium. Pardew was sent to the stands by Kevin Friend and handed a seven-game ban for the altercation . Newcastle fined their manager after the headbutt and his job is now under threat at St James' Park . But Pardew – whose position is under threat with the Magpies bottom of the table - said: ‘Obviously I have had to change. It is an incident I apologised for and regretted. ‘I have not seen him since. I will shake his hand and I am sure he will smile at me. It is something I’d like to think that I have learnt from.’ And Meyler reflected: 'Of course I was surprised, I think everyone was. ‘At the time, we were 3-1 down. When the ball went over that way, I just rushed to get the ball back because I wanted to try and get us back into the game. Obviously the rest is history. ‘The FA dealt with it in their own way and Newcastle did too, it's done, it's forgotten about. He served his ban and he was fined heavily. He will be annoyed with himself. I just had to worry about the game, losing 4-1.’ Hull won 3-2 on Tyneside last season and a repeat performance is Meyler’s prime concern. ‘Their fans want a change (of manager) - that's up to them,’ said the former Sunderland schemer, speaking ahead of the launch of EA Sports FIFA 15. ‘I'm a Hull City footballer. I'm not too bothered about what happens at Newcastle. Please God, we will just beat them and take three points.

"In a stadium full of cheering football fans, it was classical opera quartet Amore's job to grab the crowd's attention with their performance of the FA hymn 'Abide With Me'. And one member clearly aimed to do that, with her dress split to the navel and baring her cleavage. Soprana Monica McGhee, a member of quartet Amore who kicked off the FA Cup Final match today between Wigan Athletic and Manchester City, chose to perform the song in a risque cream ruffled dress. The camera focused on Monica McGhee, member of Amore, a little bit too long as the band performed . Grabbing the crowd's attention: The ruffled dress was an eye-catching addition to the ensemble's outfits . Amore had Tweeted about how excited they were to perform with the orchestra, and to the fans . With her cleavage on show the camera chose to linger on the Royal College of Music graduate as she and her bandmates performed the hymn at Wembley stadium this afternoon. Her other bandmates mezzo soprano Victoria Gray chose a strapless - but more demure - blue floor-length gown, while bariton Peter Braithwaite and tenor David Webb chose smart suits and Dune shoes. The camera swept over all of them - but seemed to focus intently on a side shot of Ms McGhee, highlighting how low-cut her dress' neckline. They were performing with the help of the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra . One Twitter user, called Chris Guy, referred: 'Highlight so far the side on view of one of the opera singers during 'Abide With Me'. On their official Twitter, the band were clearly pleased with their looks though. Despite their energetic performance, the quartet drew criticism from viewers - some who despised the operatic style of singing, and others who just wanted the crowd to sing . They wrote: 'Huge love to the amazing . team @lockonego & @jonnylockonego for making us glam for FA Cup . Final! #Wembley #buzzing XxX'. But despite her attention-grabbing outfit, the quartet drew many comments for all the wrong reasons. Many fans took to Twitter to complain about how the hymn 'completely ruined by those operatic style singers!'. User Colin Murray said: 'Abide with me? Okay, but only if you allow me to wear earplugs. It's meant to be simple and poignant, not layered.' Another, under the name of Anthony Hamilton, said: 'Abide With Me normally an FA Cup highlight. That sounded like a fire in a pet shop.' One user called dangerhere referred to one of the member's brightly-patterned suit jacket, saying: 'Murdering Abide With Me with histrionics and that jacket. Shameful.' Twitter users vented their disappointment at the rendition of the song by the band . There was a host of criticism about the performance, despite the band's enthusiastic version of the song . Amore are signed to Warner Music Entertainment label and have made a debut album with the Grammy winning producer and arranger, Simon Franglen. On her website's biography page, Ms McGhee said: ''Singing this kind of music is really daunting as it requires such precision and hard work but it is completely worth it. 'We love communicating with audiences and sharing the great stories of operas. 'We are all still working on our voices everyday as we know we never stop learning-the singers we look up to are the ones who are constantly bettering themselves and bring the most moving performances to audiences!'","Soprano Monica McGhee chose to bare her cleavage in ruffled cream dress .

"Snubbed: Traditionalist Anglican leaders are threatening to snub new Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby over gay clergy . Traditionalist Anglican leaders are threatening to snub the new Archbishop of Canterbury in a furious row over gay clergy. Conservative archbishops from Africa and Asia, who are among Anglicanism’s most senior clerics, are planning to boycott a meeting called by Archbishop Justin Welby that is scheduled to take place after his enthronement this week. The leaders are flying in for Archbishop Welby’s formal installation service in Canterbury Cathedral on Thursday. Archbishop Welby, the nominal head of the 70 million members of the worldwide Anglican Church, called the behind-the-scenes meeting in an effort to patch up divisions. He is so concerned he has appointed the Church’s first ‘director of reconciliation’, Canon David Porter of Coventry Cathedral, to broker a peace. But the conservative primates are so furious with Church of England plans to allow gay clergy in civil partnerships to become bishops that they are expected to boycott the gathering. They are also unlikely to sit at the same table as their liberal counterpart from the United States, Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori,  who has already consecrated openly gay bishops. According to leaked documents seen by The Mail on Sunday, at least three senior African archbishops have privately urged conservative colleagues to shun the gathering. In the documents, the Primate of Kenya, Archbishop Eliud Wabukala, said he recommended that ‘we show our commitment to the Anglican Communion by being present for the service at Canterbury Cathedral . . . but do not participate in the “collegial time” being proposed by Archbishop Welby’. He said the new Archbishop of Canterbury had ‘given us no clear indication of the matters for discussion’ and that primates ‘who have led the way in promoting false teaching’ will be welcomed by Dr Welby. He said his views were shared by the Primate of Nigeria, Archbishop Nicholas Okoh, and the Primate of Uganda, Archbishop Stanley Ntagali, but sources said the African and Asian archbishops would not make a final decision about attending the meeting until this week. Guests: Anglican leaders from across the globe are flying to the UK for Archbishop Welby¿s formal installation service in Canterbury Cathedral , Kent, on Thursday . Nine primates issued a statement last month condemning the Church of England’s bishops for declaring that gay clergy in civil partnerships could now become bishops – as long as they remained celibate. Several African Anglican churches have said they would break off relations with the Archbishop of Canterbury if the Church of England appoints a gay bishop. Last night, the Bishop of Liverpool, James Jones, became the most senior Church of England cleric to urge the Church to bless gay couples in civil partnerships. Lambeth Palace declined to  comment.","Furious archbishops from Africa and Asia planning to snub meeting .

"Many comedy sketches in the closing ceremony were meant to get a giggle from the crowd, but one of the funniest moments was completely unrehearsed - with Boris Johnson and David Cameron leaving viewers on stitches with their 'dad dancing' to the Spice Girls. The crowd erupted as the Spice Girls drove into the stadium in black cabs to make their first performance together since 2008 when their world tour was cut short. But as Sporty, Posh, Scary, Baby and Ginger Spice launched into a rendition of Spice Up Your Life while standing on top of their taxis, the camera panned round to show some unlikely stars of the show - Boris Johnson and Cameron strutting their stuff with their wives. Scroll down to watch Boris dad dancing... Strutting his stuff: Boris Johnson, second right, gives a perfect impression of 'dad dancing' next to his wife Marina Wheeler, far right . 'Dad dancing': Boris Johnson awkwardly rocked back and forth, using his arms for momentum, as his wife and David and Samantha Cameron clapped along to Spice Up Your Life . Rocking out: Boris Johnson became an unlikely star of the show after viewers took to Twitter expressing delight at his dance moves . Unfortunately, the London mayor and the Prime Minister gave a prime example of 'dad dancing', getting into 'girl Power' with slightly awkward punching of the arms while rocking their bodies from side to side. The pair were accompanied by their wives - Samantha Cameron and Marina Wheeler. Twitter erupted with viewers and even TV personalities commenting on the hilarious footage. BBC presenter Clare Balding said she was 'crying with laughter' - tweeting: 'Have had to rewind to Boris throwing those shapes & watch it three times.' While footballer Rio Ferdinand tweeted: ‘Gwaaaarn....Go on Boris Johnson, bopping + I swear singing along to the Spice Girls....Big! Hahaha classic from the future PM!!’ Girl power: The Spice Girls performed together for the first time since 2008 at the Olympics closing ceremony .

But after shaking some moves, Boris had to attend to his duties, handing over the flag to IOC President Jacques Rogge, who in turn presented it to Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes, each waving the traditional four times.

"Momentum is a key ingredient of sporting success. Being ‘on a roll’ can be the difference between winning and losing. And it’s the same in broadcasting. If a programme gets off to a flier there’s often little that can stop it. BBC’s The Great British Bake Off is a perfect example. It was an instant, if surprising, hit when it began on BBC2 and is now a BBC1 blockbuster. In its 50th year, BBC’s Match of the Day, which also started on BBC2, has a definite spring in its step. A strong World Cup folded into a celebration of Match of the Day’s half-century. The nation’s great and good queued up to wish the programme well. That, and the return of live FA Cup ties this season, and you sense an upbeat mood in the BBC’s football ranks. Gary Lineker (second right) is the current ringmaster of Match of the Day, and is perfect for the role . Jimmy Hill became Match of the Day presenter in 1973 and fronted over 600 shows . A montage celebrating the 50th anniversary shows all of the Match of the Day presenters . Its Saturday evening showcase is definitely feeding off the credence and confidence its anniversary has given it. And it also seems to be trying that little bit harder. The look is sharp and clean and a use of virtual reality to fill the foreground studio shots with the day’s key players works well, as does the enhanced graphics support for its pundits. Executives have used Alan Hansen’s retirement to cast the net around a range of former players turned rookie broadcasters. Phil Neville — fully recovered from his World Cup co-commentary nightmare — Danny Murphy, Robbie Savage, Ruud Gullit, Neil Lennon, and Martin Keown are now regular team-mates alongside Alan Shearer. Rio Ferdinand is on the programme too, but more often in a QPR shirt than in an open-necked number of his choice. The post-match analysis is insightful and contemporary — heat maps, player positions and touch maps, all available for selection. And if any encouragement is needed for the new ‘boys’ to play at the top of their game, just watching the opening titles probably does the job — or scares the living daylights out of them. That montage of the programme’s history, accompanied by TV’s most recognisable theme, is the challenge set for those in front and behind the cameras. The graphics for Match of the Day have come on a long way since the early years . Match of the Day 2 is also popular - pictured (l-r) are Gordon Strachan, then host Adrian Chiles, and Kevin Day . Brian Barwick spent 18 years at the BBC, and was an editor for Match of the Day . Saturday was not blessed with outstanding fixtures but there was still plenty for presenter Gary Lineker, Shearer and Savage to go at. Lineker is the ringmaster, seemingly involved in everything on the show, and it works. Shearer talked of the noted improvement of Hull City. ‘It takes time to establish yourself,’ he said. He could have been talking about himself but the fact he ‘led’ the analysis on the opening three matches suggests he’s made it. Robbie Savage rarely spoke in the first half-hour, but when he did it was a salvo at the officials’ highly dubious awarding of a West Brom penalty at Anfield. ‘Absolutely shocking decision,’ was his opener. Savage tends to speak in headlines but, with more experience and guidance, may find less is more. No bad thing. Sunday’s Match of the Day 2 offered four more games. The programme has its own identity and subtle differences, even down to Mark Chapman presenting right to left as opposed to Lineker’s left to right. All available graphics support and visual techniques were at hand for Neville, Trevor Sinclair and Keown, resplendent in shirt and tie, to unpick the action and the weekend’s output was rounded off with Angel di Maria winning the September Goal of the Month — a much-loved feature that began in 1970. Remember Ernie Hunt’s famous ‘donkey-kick’ goal? And that’s the trick of the in-form Match of the Day: blending the best of the old with the best of the new.","Match of the Day is celebrating 50 years of successful broadcasting this season, and has a definite spring in its step .

"President Barack Obama may send ground troops into Iraq, a senior White House official said this afternoon. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters accompanying the president on his vacation that Obama would consider sending in troops to help save thousands of Iraqis trapped on a mountain if that was the recommendation of 130 Marines and special forces sent in Tuesday to access the situation. That action would be 'different than reintroducing U.S. forces in a combat role to take the fight to ISIL,' however, Rhodes claimed, according to the New York Times, because the troops' sole objective would be the humanitarian rescue mission. 'We don’t believe it’s sustainable to have . permanent airdrops' of food and water, he said. Scroll down for video . Displaced Iraqis from the Yazidi community gather for humanitarian aid at Nowruz camp, in Derike, Syria, on Tuesday. The U.S. is sending in 130 troops to Iraq to access the feasibility of rescuing Yazidis who remain stranded on Sinjar Mountain . Yazidi refugees wait for a chance to board a helicopter sent by the Kurdish autonomous government to Iraq's Sinjar mountains on Tuesday. Members of the religious group have been stranded on the mountain for more than a week . Sick Iraqi children from the Yazidi community wait for treatment at a clinic at the refugee camp in Derike, Syria . United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron also announced plans for an international rescue mission in Iraq today for the refugees who are 'exposed, starving and dying of thirst' on the mountain. Cameron flew back from a vacation to Portugal a half a day early to participate in an emergency meeting about the crisis, saying afterward his country would 'play a role' in relief efforts. The UK leader said 'detailed plans are now being put in place’ for the mission but declined to share them with reporters. Another 130 U.S. troops arrived in . Iraq on Tuesday on what the Pentagon described as a temporary mission to . assess the scope of the humanitarian crisis facing thousands of . displaced Iraqi civilians trapped on Sinjar Mountain and evaluate . options for getting them out to safety. 'This is not a combat boots on the ground kind of operation,' Defense . Secretary Chuck Hagel said in announcing the deployment yesterday in remarks to Marines at a Southern California base. 'We're not going back into Iraq in any of the same combat mission . dimensions that we once were in in Iraq,' he added, referring to the . eight-year war that cost more than 4,400 U.S. lives and soured the . American public on military involvement in Iraq. Another defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide additional details on the sensitive mission, told the Associated Press the extra troops were Marines and special operations forces whose mission was to assess the situation in the Sinjar area and to develop additional humanitarian assistance options beyond current U.S. efforts there. A separate official told AP the mission for the130 troops could last less than one week. That official also said that while the troops were not being sent in to execute some type of rescue mission of the Yazidis on the mountain, they would assess the feasibility of a rescue or what one might look like. They would also assist in the ongoing effort to evaluate the use of airstrikes as part of the mission to protect the Yazidis from attacks by the Islamic State militants. Hagel referred to the 130 as 'assessors.' The additional troops arrived Tuesday in the city of Erbil, well east of Sinjar. They were to work with representatives of the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development to coordinate plans with international partners and non-government organizations to help the trapped Yazidi civilians on Sinjar Mountain. 'They will make a very rapid and critical assessment because we understand it's urgent to try to move those people off the mountain,' Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters traveling with him in Honiara, Solomon Islands. The move shows the Obama administration is weighing the impact and implications of several days of targeted airstrikes on the Islamic State fighters and how that has affected U.S.-backed Kurdish forces opposing them in northern Iraq. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel addresses the Marines assembled in a hangar at Camp Pendleton on Tuesday. Hagel announced the Iraq deployment in his remarks  at this Southern California base . One immediate dilemma was the fate of thousands of displaced Yazidis in the Sinjar area who have been provided with food and water delivered by U.S. cargo planes in recent days. Washington also was considering how to increase its military assistance to the Kurds, whose militia is outgunned by the militants. The 130 were in addition to 90 U.S. military advisers already in Baghdad and 160 in a pair of operations centers — one in Erbil and one in Baghdad — working with Iraqi security forces. They were in addition to about 455 U.S. security forces and 100 military personnel working in the Office of Security Cooperation in the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. U.S. officials said that while Obama put caps on the number of troops deployed to Iraq, these latest forces were being sent under the authorization for humanitarian assistance and therefore did not exceed the limits. 'This is not a combat boots on the ground kind of operation,' Hagel told them . Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, left, shakes hands with Camp Pendleton Marines after bringing them up to date on the situation in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Pentagon official said the 130 troops deployed to Iraq were 'assessors,' not combat troops . Hagel takes a question from Gunnery Sgt. Wilburn Jeffrey during a question and answer period with Marines . President Barack Obama has said repeatedly he will not send ground combat forces back into Iraq. But Obama's assurances have done little to quell the concerns of Democrats who worry that repeated deployments of U.S. forces will result in mission creep. 'I oppose open-ended military commitments, which the president’s . actions in Iraq could become,' Sen. Richard Blumenthal told The Hill last Friday. 'I am deeply concerned that these actions could lead to prolonged direct . military involvement, which I would strongly oppose,' he said. Sam Brannen, a former Pentagon official under Obama who now serves as a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and . International Studies, told the Wall Street Journal that even a rescue mission like the one the administration is currently mulling could end up landing the U.S. back in Iraq militarily. 'This to me represents a dramatic . escalation, and I think it deserves a little bit of thought to avoid . exactly a Black Hawk down situation, where you think you're there for . humanitarian reasons and suddenly you're there for a civil war,' he said. On Saturday President Obama admitted that he had no timeline for the U.S. to cease its operations in Iraq. 'I’m not going to give a particular . timetable, because as I’ve said from the start, wherever and whenever . U.S. personnel and facilities are threatened, it’s my obligation, my . responsibility as Commander-in-Chief, to make sure that they are . protected,' he said.","The Pentagon insisted yesterday that new troops were 'assessors' and this is not a 'combat boots on the ground kind of operation'

"Officials from Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery claim Robin Hood (illustrated) originated from Yorkshire. They state the county features predominantly in literature about the outlaw . Everything you know about the legend of Robin Hood may be wrong, after experts have claimed the outlaw was in fact a Yorkshireman. Refuting centuries-old reports that the villain lived in Sherwood Forest in Nottingham, a curator from a Doncaster museum states evidence suggests otherwise. She claims literary references put Robin Hood firmly in Barnsdale, Doncaster and Pontefract throughout his life - and he was also buried in Kirklees, West Yorkshire. ‘It's more than likely that Robin Hood was a Yorkshireman,' said Carolyn Dalton, from Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery. ‘Robin Hood's links to Yorkshire are far stronger historically, the oldest and most detailed stories give details of the north Doncaster and Pontefract area. ‘I think over the years Yorkshire hasn't made much of the connection. 'In terms of where Robin and his men lived, history points to Barnsdale near Doncaster.’ Legend has always stated the leader of the Merry Men originated from Sherwood Forest - the stomping ground of his archenemy, the Sheriff of Nottingham. But Yorkshire historians claim the earliest stories put his origins firmly in Barnsdale - on the border between South and West Yorkshire near Doncaster. The experts argue Yorkshire boasts more points of historical reference than any other county, including the site where Robin Hood's remains are believed to be buried at Kirklees Priory, near Brighouse, West Yorkshire. Scroll down for video . One of the earliest stories of the outlaw, The Gest of Robin Hood, is set in Barnsdale Forest, just north of Doncaster, near Pontefract, West Yorkshire. First written down in the 15th Century, the Gest also mentions a church where Robin later marries Maid Marian, which is thought to be St Mary Magdalene, Campsall, in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. And in another legend, the outlaw ties the Bishop of Hereford to a tree in Barnsdale and robs him. One of the earliest stories of the outlaw, The Gest of Robin Hood, is set in Barnsdale Forest, just north of Doncaster, near Pontefract, West Yorkshire (pictured). While the only early ballad to mention Nottingham  is Robin Hood and the Monk, with few mentions of the notorious Sheriff . ‘It's more than likely that Robin Hood was a Yorkshireman,' said Carolyn Dalton, from Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery (pictured holding a 14th century Hallgate medieval pot). ‘Robin Hood's links to Yorkshire are far stronger historically, the oldest and most detailed stories give details of Doncaster and Pontefract' One of the earliest stories of Robin Hood, called The Gest of Robin Hood, is set in Barnsdale Forest, just north of Doncaster, near Pontefract, West Yorkshire. First written down in the 15th Century, the Gest also mentions a church where Robin later marries Maid Marian, which is thought to be St Mary Magdalene, Campsall, in Doncaster, South Yorks. In another legend, the outlaw ties the Bishop of Hereford to a tree in Barnsdale and robs him. This was said to have taken place in Skelbrooke Park in Doncaster, South Yorks., where a 'Bishop's tree' still stands, and it is the home of Robin Hood's Well. Robin Hood's remains are believed to be buried at Kirklees Priory, near Brighouse, in West Yorkshire, too. But the only early ballad to mention Nottingham is 'Robin Hood and the Monk' and few mention the notorious Sheriff. This was said to have taken place in Skelbrooke Park in Doncaster, where a 'Bishop's tree' still stands, and it is the home of Robin Hood's Well. But the only early ballad to mention Nottingham is Robin Hood and the Monk, and few mention the notorious Sheriff. Robin Hood was first referred to in the late 14th century, and in tales throughout the 15th century including Robin Hood and the Monk, and Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne. During this time, there are also accounts of people taking on the name Robin Hood, or Robehod, to imitate the original, which is why there is some confusion over his true identity. The tales place Robin Hood in the north, but refer to both Barnsdale and Sherwood. Experts believe the legend may have derived from two separate sources, and could have referred to two separate Robin Hoods. An epitaph recorded in 1702 claims Robin Hood was buried in Kirklees, in West Yorkshire, where the legend claims he was killed, supposedly by the Sheriff of Nottingham, and dates to 1247. Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery has unveiled an exhibition exploring its links to Robin to mark this year's St Leger horse racing festival. The town council is also inviting members of the public to support the claims in a visitors' poll. An epitaph recorded in 1702 claims Robin Hood was buried in Kirklees, in West Yorkshire, where the legend claims he was killed, supposedly by the Sheriff of Nottingham. This grave (pictured) dates to 1247 . Ms Dalton holds a 14th century dagger, which she hopes help prove Robin Hood was from Yorkshire. It is part of a wider exhibition that Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery has unveiled, exploring its links to Robin Hood. Nottingham already features a number of statues (pictured right) and tours linked to the outlaw . Medieval artefacts are on display as part of the exhibition, which opened this week, while the question of whether Doncaster can claim Robin will be decided in the visitors' poll. Ms Dalton is also keen to set up a Robin Hood trail in the area. Councillor Bob Johnson, Doncaster Council's cabinet member for tourism, said: ‘Robin Hood's links to Doncaster and the rest of Yorkshire are perhaps more convincing than Nottingham's, so I'm hoping the exhibition will be interesting and thought-provoking.’ This is not the first time a custody battle between Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire has been fought. In 2004, Doncaster was accused of ‘jumping on the bandwagon’ when it named its airport after the hero who robbed from the rich to feed the poor. The legend of Robin Hood is believed to date back to the reign of King John in the 13th century. He was one of three prominent outlaws, including Fulk Fitzwarin and Eustace the Monk, but while the latter two were clearly identified historical figures, it is unclear who exactly Robin Hood was. Forests during this time were covered by forest law and were protected as private places for the king, where he could hunt. Many fugitives used these areas, however, to hide out and both Sherwood and Barnsdale Forest feature heavily in the legends.

"The 298 victims on board tragic flight MH17 would have been killed instantly or remained conscious for only a few seconds after the plane was struck down by a missile, an Australian expert has claimed. Forensic scientist David Royds, from the University of Canberra, told the Herald Sun that it's 'very unlikely the passengers would have suffered' when the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200 was shot down by pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine. As investigators continue to piece together what happened, Professor Royds' analysis offers some comfort to the families of the victims, including 37 Australians, who he says would have had 'no time to worry'. 'It’s very unlikely the passengers would have suffered, there would have been no time to worry,' he told the Herald Sun. Scroll down for video . Professor Royds says the victims would not have had time to react to what happened, if not killed instantly, when the missile struck MH17 . The bodies of the around 200 victims have been transported to eastern Ukraine. Professor Royd says dramatic and immediate drops in temperature and cabin pressure would have rendered them unconscious . David Royds (right), who led investigations in the Bali bombing, says passengers would not have suffered . Professor Boyd, who led forensic investigations into the Bali bombings, says that an explosion would have triggered a chain reaction that would have 'rendered the passengers unconscious within seconds' - including dramatic and instant drops in air pressure and temperature and a loss of oxygen. It comes as victims' bodies were transported via train to eastern Ukraine, but families were concerned that the painstaking identification process could take months. An Australian air force plane and refrigerated trucks have arrived in Holland but Ukraine says there were only 200 recovered from the crash site. Experts are also concerned that readings from MH17's black boxes may reveal nothing about the attack, rendering them virtually useless to investigators. And while photos have emerged showing damage to the front panels from the doomed airline point, which may be conclusive evidence of a missile strike, Professor Boyd says the victims' bodies themselves may provide 'trace evidence of shrapnel wounds'. Photographs show pieces of the Boeing 777 have tiny holes indicating small pieces of shrapnel entered the aircraft externally, it has been reported. A piece of wreckage from Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, in a field near Rozsypne in the eastern Ukraine, several miles from the largest concentration of debris . According to analysts, the perforation holes visible on the debris are consistent with high-velocity shrapnel from fragmenting warheads like the SA-11 ""Buk"" missiles American officials have said likely brought down the plane . Experts have warned that the 'black boxes' from MH17 may yield nothing about the attack, rendering them virtually useless to investigators . Reed Foster, a defense analyst, told the New York Times that the two likely causes were an engine explosion or an exploding missile. According to Mr Foster, the SA-11 missiles intercept targeted aircraft before exploding near it creating a cloud of shrapnel. An SA-11 missile carries about 46 pounds of explosives and detonates about 100 to 300 feet away from the target. Meanwhile Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Operation Bring Them Home - to bring the 37 Australian victims back - would be headed up by former defence chief Angus Houston, who also coordinated Australian search efforts for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. The refrigerated train carrying the dead has arrived in Kharkiv - in Ukraine's east - where Australian and Dutch representatives will prepare them for transport to the Netherlands for the identification process. A Boeing C-17 of the Australian Air Force stands at the Eindhoven Airbase in The Netherlands. The aircraft will, together with aircrafts of the Dutch Air Force, repatriate from Kharkiv to Eindhoven the bodies of the victims . Mr Abbott also wrote in the condolence book for the plane crash victims on Tuesday at Parliament House . Carriages of death: A train carrying the remains victims of the Malaysia Airlines MH17 disaster arrives in the Ukrainian government-held city of Kharkiv . Journalists follow the train as it arrives in the city of Kharkiv, where the victims will be flown to the Netherlands . The transportation and identification process in Ukraine and the Netherlands will involve consular officers, Australian Federal Police experts and air safety investigators. Despite Tuesday's progress, Mr Abbott warned there was 'still a long, long way to go'. 'After the crime comes the cover-up,' he told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday. 'What we have seen is evidence tampering on an industrial scale, and obviously that has to stop.' Mr Abbott said he understood the families' frustration at the lengthy process, but it was something that needed to be done. 'I need to caution that this is necessarily a painstaking and methodical process that will take some weeks,' he said. The train arrived in Kharkiv on Tuesday night, carrying the bodies of MH17 victims from the crash site . The bodies will be flown to the Netherlands from Kharkiv to be formally identified by forensic and identification experts . Operation Bring Them Home started just hours after Foreign Minister Julie Bishop helped secure a unanimous vote in the United Nations Security Council to allow 'safe, secure, full and unrestricted access' to the Malaysia Airlines crash site for international investigators in a move to find out who is responsible for the tragedy. 'There must be a ceasefire in the immediate area around the site,' Ms Bishop told the Security Council. 'The victims must be treated with dignity, brought back to their homes and laid to rest.'All parties are required to fully cooperate with these efforts. 'Russia must use its influence over the separatists to ensure this. Russia must also use its influence to bring the conflict in Ukraine to an end.' Mo Maslin, Otis Maslin and Evia Maslin - aged 12, eight and 10 - were among the Australian victims . Fatima Dyczynski (left) and Jack O'Brien (right) were another two victims of the MH17 crash . Mr Abbott's formal message of condolence to the victims' families on behalf of the nation . Pro-Russian separatists - who stand accused of bringing down the aircraft, possibly with a missile supplied by Moscow - bowed to a furious clamour for the bodies and black boxes to be handed to investigators five days after the crash. Mr Razak said the boxes were handed over to the Malaysian team in Donetsk at 9pm Ukraine time on Monday. The small handing over ceremony has finally solved the question as to what had happened to the two vital devices. Mr Razak revealed that in recent days the team had been working quietly behind the scenes to establish contact with 'those' - a reference to the rebels - in charge of the MH17 crash site. The contact was finally made - but he made it clear it had not been easy. 'Under difficult and fluid circumstances, we have been discussing the problems that have occupied us all - securing vital evidence from the aircraft, launching an independent investigation and above all recovering the remains of those who lost their lives.' The Prime Minister said that in . another breakthrough an independent international investigation team . would be guaranteed safe access to the crash site. 'I . must stress that although agreement has been reached, there remain a . number of steps required before it is completed,' Mr Razak said. Tragic: A toy is placed at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 near the village of Hrabove, eastern Ukraine . UK foreign secretary Philip Hammond said all the evidence currently available indicates that the surface-to-air missile which destroyed the MH17 was supplied by Russia . 'There . is work still to be done, work which relies on continued communication . in good faith. [Rebel leader] Mr Borodai and his people have so far . given their co-operation. 'I . ask that all parties continue to work together to ensure that this . agreement is honoured; that the remains of our people are returned, that . the black box is handed over, and that the international team is . granted full access to the site. 'Only . then can the investigation into MH17 truly begin; only then can the . victims be afforded the respect they deserve. We need to know what . caused the plane to crash, and who was responsible for it, so that . justice may be done. 'In . recent days, there were times I wanted to give greater voice to the . anger and grief that the Malaysian people feel. And that I feel. But . sometimes, we must work quietly in the service of a better outcome. 'I . understand that for the families, nothing can undo this damage.

"While enjoying a picnic or barbecue this summer, the observant among you may have noticed something was missing. For the usual buzz of wasps around your sandwiches will probably have been absent. Conservationists and pest controllers alike have noticed a remarkable lack of wasps this summer - and they are all worried. Given the baking hot weather we experienced in June and July, and the bumper fruit harvest we are seeing at the moment, they would have expected wasps to be enjoying a glorious year. Experts believe that the decline in wasps has been caused by the topsy-turvy weather over the last few years . But insect experts have noticed a distinct lack of wasps in our orchards and meadows, where they would be usually gorging on the fruits of early autumn. None are entirely sure why the insects are having such a bad year - though all are agreed it is something to do with the topsy-turvy weather we have seen over the last few years. Jon Curson, a senior ecologist at Natural England, said: ‘Wasps are cold-blooded creatures - they really need some heat to get going. ‘If you get just a few weeks of bad weather when the wasps are developing in the nest it will really hit them.’ Matthew Oates, wildlife specialist at the National Trust, thinks the problem may go all the way back to the miserable summer of 2012. ‘It is as though the wasps have vanished,’ he said. ‘They took a major hit in 2012 with that awful summer, then last year we had the coldest March on record and by the time things picked up for them in June or so it was just too late for them to recover. ‘This year we have had a good spring and summer overall and I would have expected them to recover.’ But he added: ‘There have been key points where it has been very bad. ‘The last week of April and the last week of May were cold, and then we have had a very cool wet August. It may be they were just hit at the wrong time. Matthew Oates, wildlife specialist at the National Trust, thinks the problem may go all the way back to the miserable summer of 2012 . ‘And if that is the case, it means that wasps have been hit by the weather three years on the trot - which would explain why there are very few around.’ Most people do not notice wasps until late summer. Earlier in the summer the worker wasps are out scouring the trees and bushes catching greenflies and aphids and bringing back the chewed remains to feed baby wasps in the nest. In return, the tiny larvae supply them with sweet saliva, which gives them energy. But by late August and September, when all the larvae have grown, the worker wasps need to turn to other sources of sugar. They seek out fruit on the trees and at picnic sites, buzzing around cream teas and lemonades. Mr Oates of the National Trust said: ‘It usually becomes an issue around National Trust tea rooms and tea gardens - but this year we have had a relatively low number of stings.’ Matt Shardlow, chief executive of conservation charity Buglife, said: ‘It has been a terrible year for wasps. I noticed one day in the woods last week that I had not seen a single wasp in the entire day. We have had a few bad spells of weather but it is very puzzling.’ Pest control companies have also noticed fewer call-outs. Dean Godsell, managing director of KPN Wast Nest Removal said: ‘Not only are there low numbers this year, but the wasps seem very unhealthy. ‘It is September and we are still coming across nests that are tiny - usually you would see 5,000 wasps in a nest, but we are regularly find nests with only 30 or 40 wasps. ‘I have been doing this for 25 years and I have never seen wasps so unhealthy, their colour is dull and they are also very small.’ Whatever the reason for their absence, wasps are not just a pest to picnickers, but play a vital role in the British ecosystem. They help control pest numbers such as aphids and blackfly - helping gardeners and farmers alike.","Experts believe the topsy-turvy weather is to blame for the decline .

He paused to salute his fellow soldiers as about 6,000 people, including service personnel and their families, applauded and waved Union flags. The ceremony was one of more than 100 events, ranging from veterans' parades and bands to barbecues and fairs, taking place across the country to pay tribute to Britain's war heroes . and mark Armed Forces Day. Cheers for a hero: Thousands waved Union flags as Lance Corporal Johnson Beharry carried the Olympic Torch . 'Emotional': L/Cpl Beharry took the flame up the steps of the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, the UK's centre of remembrance . Thirty thousand poppies were dropped on the crowd by a paraglider flown by Major Alastair Macartney from Jump4Heroes, a charity which helps the Armed Forces as part of the Royal British Legion. L/Cpl Beharry said: 'It was very emotional (carrying the torch) because of the reason why I am here - to see the turnout is amazing and being here on Armed Forces Day as well. 'Armed Forces Day is important to see the general public is behind us and support us for what we do.' The Caribbean-born hero said he hoped to watch a few events at the Olympics. In 2004 L/Cpl Beharry became the first living person for 35 years to receive the Victoria Cross, which is the highest military honour for valour. Proud: L/Cpl Beharry was the first living person for 35 years to receive the Victoria Cross. He is one of 8,000 people chosen to carry the Olympic Torch on its 70-day journey to the opening ceremony in London . He earned the honour for saving the lives of 30 comrades by charging down an ambush and has since overcome terrible wounds to continue his military career. The Band of the Irish Regiment and members of the 2 Mercian Regiment followed L/Cpl Beharry as he walked up the steps to the memorial site. The Mercian Ram, Lance Corporal Derby, mascot of the 2 Mercian Regiment, was also there. Michael Hawkins, 71, from Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, was among the former servicemen who travelled to the event. Mr Hawkins, who served in the RAF for 36 years, and attended with his wife Gill, 61, said: 'I came here today because I thought it was very important on Armed Forces Day to do something that I consider significant, to come here to the National Arboretum, but in particular to see Johnson Beharry.' Tribute: The torch-bearing was one of many events held across the country today to celebrate Britain's war heroes and mark Armed Forces Day . He added: 'Today is a hugely important day for our Armed Forces. The Armed Forces serve the Crown, their country and their regiment. 'They do it every day, they do it because they want to do it. 'I honestly believe it is one of the last institutions in the country that still shows the right moral values.' L/Cpl Beharry is one of 8,000 people who have been chosen to carry the torch on an 8,000-mile, 70-day journey to the Olympic opening ceremony on July 27. In Plymouth, crowds lined the streets to cheer on the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force bands as more than 1,200 servicemen and women, veterans and cadets marched through the city.

Crowds: Sir Mark Stanhope, 1st Sea Lord of the Royal Navy, (left) addresses the parade, which was watched by thousands of well-wishers on Plymouth Hoe (right) He added: 'People across the country from all ages and backgrounds have a deep respect and appreciation for the Armed Forces, and Armed Forces Day is an excellent opportunity for us all to let our men and women realise how much they are appreciated. 'It is from our society that our Armed Forces are drawn and from our society that we draw our strength.' More than £10million is to be pumped into creating 100 cadet units in schools, the Government announced on Armed Forces Day. The move will enable more young people to join military-themed youth organisations and take pride in their community. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) and Department for Education (DfE) revealed they had committed the money for 100 new units across state-funded schools in England by 2015. The money will go towards essential equipment and training of staff. Interested schools will need to show they can get adult volunteers and third-party funding to maintain the units. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'Cadet forces offer a great opportunity to gain life skills and we are determined to ensure that we open that opportunity up to as many young people as possible. 'The funding announced by the Government today will kickstart an exciting new phase in the development of our cadet forces - fostering greater social mobility and raising awareness of the values and ethos of our Armed Forces among local communities.' Education Secretary Michael Gove said: 'Cadet forces provide an exciting and challenging way for young people to learn teamwork, self-discipline and respect. 'They have made a hugely positive impact, especially in boosting standards and discipline. 'By extending the scheme in state schools, more young people can benefit from the cadet experience. 'It will help them develop into well-rounded, accomplished adults fully prepared for life beyond school. 'We know many schools with cadet forces have a partnership or collaboration arrangements with neighbouring schools to allow more young people to take part. 'We want to see more partnerships to allow schools to share their expertise and facilities for the benefit of all.' There are four major MoD-sponsored cadet forces - the school-based Combined Cadet Force and the community-based Sea Cadet Corps, Army Cadet Force and Air Training Corps. Between them 26,000 adult volunteers deliver training to 140,000 young people a year. There are 3,280 cadet units across all four cadet forces in the UK, 324 of which are in state schools.","Lance Corporal Johnson Beharry, 32, who saved the lives of 30 comrades in Iraq, took the flame up the steps of the National Memorial Arboretum .

"James Milner believes England’s World Cup flop in Brazil will be one of the driving forces behind the quest for success at Euro 2016. Roy Hodgson’s team started the campaign with a win in Switzerland and continue with game at home to San Marino on Thursday and away in Estonia on Sunday. 'You don’t forget about the World Cup, it’s always there,' said Milner. James Milner hopes England's poor World Cup can drive them to success on their road to Euro 2016 . Adam Lallana (right) looks on as Wayne Rooney prepares to run with the ball during training . 'We haven’t forgotten about it. But you always try to move forward. We had a couple of good results and we have to build on them.' The Manchester City midfielder also shared an insight into Roy Hodgson's unit meetings before discussing the spirit in the England camp. He added: 'It’s not a new thing. We have team meetings as a full team. Over last couple of years we’ve had unit meetings to work on specific sections of the pitch and then go into a big meeting. 'The manager wants to voice an opinion. He wants our feedback as well. He wants discussions on what best for the team. I think those meetings help.

Jack Wilshere (centre) shares a joke with his new Danny Welbeck at the St George's Park training base . 'No player will ever sit here and say it’s a terrible atmosphere but it’s a great bunch of lads. It’s a tight knit group.

The 26-year-old former Southampton man, who made the switch to Anfield this summer, made his England debut in a friendly against Chile last November and has since won eight further caps ahead of this qualifying double header. Ahead of Thursday's match against San Marino at Wembley, Lallana said: 'The atmosphere has always been brilliant and a great place to work. With Stevie (Gerrard) as captain and with Wayne (Rooney) now, there's always a great feeling. 'Obviously you have good and bad times. When you lose the dressing room's always down but we always back each other up and have to go again. 'On the back of a disappointing World Cup, the last time the lads met up they put in some great performances especially against Switzerland and showed great character and showed that we have got a great team spirit and a great dressing room.'

"Members of the armed forces and police officers involved in the security of the London Olympics are to be presented with commemorative coins for their sterling work. Primer minister David Cameron said that the 18,000 soldiers, sailors and airmen who were part of the operation, many of them drafted in at late notice when private security firm G4S failed to provide sufficient staff, will receive the coin. The design of the coin is still being worked on, and will be presented to the security workers at the end of the Paralympic Games in September. Fancy that: David Cameron, right, has said that the troops and security workers at the Olympics will be awarded with commemorative coins for their efforts . Not left out: The purple-uniformed Games volunteers will receive 'batons' to mark their good work . Thousands of officers from the Metropolitan Police and forces from across the UK will also qualify, although Downing Street said the exact criteria for qualifying had not yet been finalised. Mr Cameron said that the coins were to show the nation's 'enormous gratitude' to the troops and security staff for helping to deliver a safe and secure 2012 Olympics. The Games went without a hitch in terms of security, as 80,000 people converged on the Olympic Park stadium daily - and thousands more at the other Olympic venues across the capital - which ended last night with a closing ceremony as spectacular as Danny Boyle's opener. The purple-uniformed Games volunteers are to receive a commemorative 'baton' for their efforts, and a further 18,000 will receive this who were recruited by the government to serve as Games 'ambassadors'. Mr Cameron said: 'The volunteers, members of the armed forces, police and others who worked on the Games are the ones who made them possible. Job done: Troops pose for a family photo at Horse Guards Parade . And this lot: The volunteers assisted at every turn in the hugely successful London Games . Paying homage: These volunteers paid tribute to Usain Bolt, and they will be awarded for their work at the Games . 'These people not only gave up their time, but brought a phenomenal energy and passion to the streets and to Olympic venues up and down the country. 'So I hope what will stay with the volunteers will be the experience of a lifetime in helping to make London 2012 the monumental success that it was. 'These coins and batons are just a small permanent token of the enormous gratitude we all have for them. 'The passion and professionalism of the volunteers has been matched by the fantastic work of the armed forces and the police, who have worked tirelessly to deliver a safe and secure Games. 'I am delighted to be giving a commemorative coin to everyone who helped to deliver the biggest peacetime security operation this country has ever seen. 'I also want to say a big thank you to everyone else who worked during the Olympic Games: the G4S staff and contractors, transport workers and all those who, along with our volunteers, the army and the police, helped to show the world what a fantastic country the United Kingdom is. They are the very best of Britain.' Downing Street said they were also considering awarding the coin to further people involved in the smooth sunning of the Games, including the ambulance services and the fire brigade. The security staff's being awarded the commemorative coin comes amidst G4S's announcement that they are to donate £2.5million to the armed forces as a 'goodwill gesture'. Carrying the baton: Lord Sebastain Coe thanked the volunteers in his speech at the closing ceremony on Sunday . Gratitude: The troops drafted in to help at the Games have been widely praised by politicians such as deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, left, and Mayor of London Boris Johnson . The private security firm was forced to apologise after failing to deliver on their £284million Games contract after they failed to provide the 10,000 adequately trained staff. Additional troops were drafted in to work alongside the G4S workers. Defence secretary Philip Hammond said the donation would 'go some way' to recognising the burden placed on the armed forces by the security shambles. He said: 'The armed forces provided more to the security and protection of the Games than had originally been planned, but as always they have carried out their tasks with professionalism and good humour. 'This contribution from G4S is welcome news for the service welfare funds and will go some way to recognising the inconvenience and extra burden that this commitment has placed upon our forces and their families.' The donation will go towards welfare amenities including sports equipment and to sports associations which have backed the athletes. Chief of the defence staff General Sir David Richards said: 'The armed forces are pleased to accept this donation from G4S. 'It recognises all the hard work and commitment service personnel have displayed during the London 2012 Olympic Games. Together with G4S, the men and women of the Royal Navy, army and RAF have delivered a safe and secure Olympics.' Out with a bang: Volunteers and security staff assisted in the organising of the closing ceremony .

"Danny Welbeck has admitted dreaming of playing for Arsenal even before his £16million deadline-day move to the Emirates Stadium from Manchester United. Welbeck revealed in an interview with Arsenal's website that he had always admired his new club's style from afar and pledged to capitalise on service from the Gunners' 'magnificent' midfield. The England forward also expressed his delight that the transfer had 'finally' gone through. VIDEO Scroll down for Danny Welbeck: I've envisaged myself playing for Arsenal before . Determined look: Danny Welbeck insists he is ready to make the most of his talent at Arsenal . Danny boy: Welbeck poses with his new No 23 shirt at Arsenal after his deadline-day move . All smiles: The 23-year-old forward poses in his new kit after moving to north London for £16m . 'It's exciting times for me,' he said. 'It's great to be a part of this club and it's a team that I've always watched in the Premier League. I've envisaged myself playing in this team before. For it to finally happen is very exciting.' Welbeck undoubtedly has huge potential but still has plenty to prove after a meagre goalscoring return during his time at Old Trafford. The England forward notched just 29 goals in 142 first-team appearances for United, albeit with many of those coming from the substitutes bench or while shunted out on the wing playing a support role to Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney. The 23-year-old has craved a genuine opportunity to prove himself as a top-class central striker, which he should now get at Arsenal with Olivier Giroud out for four months with an ankle injury. And Welbeck has promised that he can be a roaring success while feeding off chances created by the likes of Alexis Sanchez, Jack Wilshere and Mesut Ozil. 'I believe the style of play the manager's got and the boys play and with the magnificent players in midfield slotting balls through, I can run on to the end of those balls and slot them away,' said Welbeck. On the move: Welbeck takes on Wayne Rooney (left) during England training  at London Colney this week . Time to shine: Welbeck grew up as a young player at United but is excited to haveb now joined Arsenal . The England forward, who has scored eight goals in his 26 international appearances, admitted to having mixed feelings as he prepared to quit the club where he had grown up. 'I've been at United ever since I was a little boy and I had a great time there,' he said. 'I just think this is the next stage of my development - to come to Arsenal, to really show people what I can do as a footballer and hopefully get to the place where I want to be. 'Things move on in life and I think you've really got to make the right decision in the situation that you're in at that moment in time. 'I really do believe that coming to Arsenal is the right decision.' He added: 'I'm an Arsenal player and I couldn't be any happier at the moment.' The Manchester-born forward was clear when asked about what he can add to Arsenal's side. 'I'd like to bring pace and power to the game,' he said, while also expressing admiration for the Gunners' famous short-passing game. 'I like to join in on that and get in behind defenders and try to get shots off at goal,' he added. Despite the excitement around Welbeck's signing, some observers have still questioned Wenger's judgement in bringing in a player with potential rather than shelling out to beat United to the loan deal for Radamel Falcao. The Colombia striker was seen as a potential missing link for Arsenal to become true contenders to win the Premier League, but Welbeck insists that he can be the man to fire the club to the title. 'They've done well in recent years, last year we got the FA Cup and I feel like it's time where we could really push on and try and challenge for the Premier League title,' he said. 'I've got one (Premier League) medal and it's something that I really want to add to.' Dream team: Jack Wilshere shared this picture of him with his new tam-mate on England duty .

"The tower containing Big Ben should be renamed the Elizabeth Tower in honour of the Queen, senior MPs will say today. They are calling on Parliament’s authorities to recognise the monarch’s 60 years on the throne by mirroring a tribute paid to Queen Victoria. In 1860, the west tower of the Palace of Westminster, originally called The King’s Tower, was renamed the Victoria Tower to commemorate her long reign. Tribute: The Victoria Tower (left), seen looming over the Palace of Westminster from London's Westminster Bridge, opposite what it set to be renamed the Elizabeth Tower (right) Big Ben is the nickname for the great bell of the clock at the eastern end of the palace, but it is also generally extended to refer to the tower as well. Now a cross-party group of MPs led by Foreign Office aide Tobias Ellwood is calling for the tower to be renamed the Elizabeth Tower in June to mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. His campaign has the support of Cabinet ministers, including Commons Leader Sir George Young, as well as senior figures in the two other main parties. They want the House of Commons Commission, the august body which runs the Commons, to approve the name change. Landmark location: Prince Philip looks on as the Queen delivers a speech in Westminster Hall, next to the tower . Mr Ellwood said: ‘I can’t think of a greater tribute for Parliament to bestow on Her Majesty than the naming of such a landmark as the Clock Tower. If we get the support I hope we will, I would like to see a formal announcement or a ceremony taking place on June 2.’ Former Labour foreign secretary and Lord Chancellor Jack Straw said: ‘I think it is a very fitting tribute to a monarch who has served the country so well.’ Labour’s shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy said: ‘The Queen and the Clock Tower are known throughout the world. It would be brilliant if we could celebrate 60 years of service with a permanent monument to Her Majesty’s dedication and grace.’ Today Conservative MP Mr Ellwood will table a Commons motion calling on the Commission to take forward the proposals. It says that of the 41 monarchs who have reigned England and the UK since William the Conqueror, only Victoria and the present Queen have marked a Diamond Jubilee. The Queen and Prince Philip will take part in a glittering carriage procession through Westminster at the end of the four-day bank holiday weekend celebrating the Diamond Jubilee, Buckingham Palace announced yesterday. They will travel in the 1902 State Landau along a route lined by thousands of well-wishers before acknowledging the crowds from the balcony at the palace. Accompanying them in other carriages will be the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Harry. The spectacle on June 5 will conclude celebrations for the Queen’s 60-year reign, which include a Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant and a concert with acts including Paul McCartney, Elton John and Stevie Wonder.",MPs call for the London landmark to be renamed for the Diamond Jubilee .
"Tom Cleverley has targeted an England recall after completing his last-ditch switch to Aston Villa. The midfielder moved to Villa Park on a season-long loan from Manchester United after the Premier League sanctioned the deal. Villa made a late move before the transfer deadline after initially calling off a permanent deal on Monday because of the player's wage demands. They then had to wait to see if they had completed the paperwork on time before the move was confirmed on Tuesday. VIDEO Scroll down for archive footage of Cleverley  scoring sublime goal in England training . New challenge: Tom Cleverley (left) completed his loan move to Aston Villa from Manchester United . Cleverley was out of favour at Old Trafford and has also lost his place in the England squad after playing in seven of their 10 World Cup qualifiers. England host Norway in a friendly on Wednesday and go to Switzerland on Monday for the start of their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign without him. And Cleverley, who was left out of the Three Lions' World Cup squad this summer, wants to force his way back into boss Roy Hodgson's plans. 'I have got to get back playing and hopefully as a by-product of that I can get back in the England team,' the 25-year-old, who has 13 caps, told the club website. 'The thing I am concentrating on though is trying to come in and hit the ground running so I can help Aston Villa. Out of favour: Cleverley was in danger of finding himself frozen out at United if he did not secure a move . 'Playing football is what matters most to me and I'm looking forward to getting back to what I know I can do. This is the kind of club where I can do that. 'The prospect of working under the manager (Paul Lambert) and Roy (Keane, assistant manager), who were both fantastic midfielders in their playing careers, made the decision to come to Villa an easy one. 'I'm looking forward to working with them, but also the other really good midfield players that the club have, like Fabian Delph, Ashley Westwood and other new lads like Kieran Richardson, Joe Cole and Carlos Sanchez.' Villa had agreed an £8m fee with United, but walked away on Monday after failing to agree personal terms. All change: Cleverley was a regular under previous boss David Moyes but not under Louis van Gaal . Everton also tried to sign Cleverley on transfer deadline day, but failed to strike a deal, which then saw Villa resurrect the move. They are believed to have a deal in place to make the loan permanent. 'It's a team that plays the style of football I like,' Cleverley added. 'They play with high energy, they pass and move and there are a lot of good young players. The manager told me the way that he'd like me to play and it all sat perfectly for me. I'm very happy to be coming down to play for Villa.' Lambert added: 'Tom brings big game experience to the club, he's played international football for England and he still has great potential to kick on in his career. 'There's a lot of good football ahead of him if he performs the way we think he can perform and we're delighted to have been able to bring him in to join the group.'","Midfielder joins on season-long loan from Manchester United .

"Secretly snapping away in shopping malls across the country as a 20-year-old aspiring photographer during the Eighties, Micheal Galinsky never gave the people in his pictures much thought. But after recently publishing the intriguing compilation of images in a book titled Malls Across America . and online, the Brooklyn-based father-of-two has received messages from those who have spotted themselves or relatives. A man name David Walczak recognized his father in one of Mr Galinsky’s photos, just days after attending his memorial service and said he was 'shocked'. The vintage snap shows a blond-haired couple with their backs turned riding down an escalator. Caught on camera: Samantha Schneider from Michigan spotted her mother (on the far right) in one of Micheal Galinsky's Malls Across America photos . Fast-forward: Ms Schneider (left) pictured with her mother, Marlene Anderson, today . Mr Walczak wrote in an email shared with Today.com: 'That photo . . . is of my parents. I recognized them as soon as I saw it. 'The really shocking thing is we had my father’s memorial on November 7th, and visited his grave on the 8th. It really feels like my father chose this vehicle to let my family know he is in a good place.' In another picture Jamie Rutina did a double-take when he saw himself over two decades ago rocking puffy hair and a leather-look bomber jacket. 'So your going to think this sounds crazy but I'm so sure that I'm the guy [there],' he typed in a message to 44-year-old Mr Galinsky. Shocked: David Walczak recognized his father in this image, days after attending his memorial service - the photo shows his father and mother riding down an escalator . Flashback: Jamie Rutina did a double-take when he saw himself over two decades ago rocking puffy hair and a leather-look bomber jacket (left) He added: 'You cant see my face cuz [sic] I'm looking down at something, but I know it's me, the hair is mine, the coat, the stance/mannerism. I was 20 years old then.' Like Mr Walczak, Samantha Schneider from Macomb, Michigan, was surprised when she saw one of her parents in a shot. She exclaimed on Facebook, where many of the images were shared: 'This is actually very hilarious to me right now. The female on the far right of the three teenage girls is my mother (Marlene Anderson). 'It's really powerful to see yourself randomly in that way. It's shocking' 'The blonde is Brigette Sloan and the brunette in the middle's name is Sue one of my mother's friends from High School, although my mother cannot remember her last name. 'I believe they are in front of Bakers shoes, according to my mother that's what the store behind them looks like.' In a frame showing three young men wearing football jackets Ryan Travis from New York wrote: 'The ""jock"" on the left is my uncle! Number 62.' Mr Galinsky said the experience has made him realize the true power of photography. 'It’s really powerful to see yourself randomly in that way. It’s shocking.' Identity parade: 'The ""jock"" on the left is my uncle! Number 62.,' Ryan Travis from New York wrote . While he has confirmed some of the subjects, he says that most times people mistakenly see themselves. Indeed, one woman wrote on Facebook: 'Can u plz [sic] tell me what mall this taken in if you remember, I think this is me . . . I worked at the ice cream shop in the mall during the late 80s early 90s - this was a really popular look so I understand it may not be me.' But when Mr Galinsky confirmed the location as Smith Haven Mall in Lake Grove, New York, the woman replied: 'Then not me! I wish I could show you my photos from then .. it looks just like me.' 'That photo is of my parents. We had my father’s memorial on November 7. It feels like he chose this vehicle to let us know he is in a good place.' Mr Galinsky, who is now a photographer, musician and award-winning filmmaker, was just 20 when he began . driving across the U.S. in 1989, capturing pictures from shopping . malls in different states for a college art project. In an extract from his book, he writes that his college photography teacher at New York . University encouraged him to travel across the country after she saw . photos he had taken at the local mall in Garden City, Long Island. In . 1989, he embarked on a road trip to the West Coast with a friend, and . by the time they got to San Francisco they had visited over a dozen . malls and even more thrift stores and antique shops. While the tiled floors, . artificial plants and brightly-lit stores are recognizable features of . malls to this day, the customers' hairstyles and fashion reveal the era . these photos were taken in. Do you know who this is? One woman thought this was her in the photo but the location of the mall didn't match up to the ice cream parlor where she used to work . Mr Galinsky told Today.com in 2011 that the time period is just as significant as the physical setting of his photos. 'At the time, the mall was the new public space, the new community center where people would interact. 'It was surreal to walk around - even the ""restaurants"" in the food court were the same. This was America' 'This was pre-Internet, pre-cellphone, there was smoking in malls, it . was before the Gulf War. It was this weird moment in time where things . were getting ready to change.' Indeed, . one of the most noticeable aspects of the images is their lack of cell . phones, iPads and other technology that play such a large role in our . lives today. Another detail that reveals these photos are relics from the past is that several of the subjects are smoking inside the mall. In . one such photo, a woman perches on a sofa puffing on a cigarette while . children play by a water feature in a shopping mall lobby. Are you in there? Malls Across America hit book stores last month . The . signs for shops like Tape World and Musicland also reveal a bygone era, . as do the boxy television sets being sold at one of the stores. Mr . Galinsky says one of the ground-breaking moments on his road trip was . when he visited a mall in St Louis, Missouri, and he realized it was . identical to one he had been to in Vancouver, Washington. 'It . was a completely surreal experience to walk around that space,’ he . says. 'Even the ""restaurants"" in the food court were the same. This was . America.'

"More than 80 cave rescue specialists are fighting to save the life of a man injured by falling rocks in a grotto a kilometre beneath the German Alps. The rescue could take days, police warned, as experts negotiate a labyrinth of vertical shafts and bottlenecks in the Riesending cave system, near Berchtesgaden, south-east Germany. Mountain rescue official Klemans Reindl said his colleagues were at work 'in one of the most difficult caves in Europe', access to which is complicated by water and tight spots. German rescue workers (one pictured entering the cave) managed to reach the injured man on Monday . Tricky operation: Mountain rescue official Klemans Reindl said his colleagues were at work 'in one of the most difficult caves in Europe', access to which is complicated by water and tight spots . 'We have shafts that go straight down 350 metres (1,150 feet), where you have to rappel down and climb back up on a rope,' he told Germany's n-tv television. A four-member rescue team reached the 52-year-old German cave researcher early today. He had suffered head and upper body injuries a day earlier in a rockfall deep inside the caves. One of his two companions made a 12-hour solo climb back to the cave entrance to call for help, while the other stayed with him. The victim is stuck nearly 1,000 metres (3,300ft) beneath the ground. Officials said he is around three miles from the cave entrance. He is believed to be in stable condition. More than 80 mountain rescuers from numerous countries have been working to free him . Six experts from Germany, Austria and Switzerland are now with the explorer - who they say is conscious and able to walk with help . Mr Reindl said the cave system has tight spots where only a slim person can squeeze through, and explorers also have to contend with water. Another mountain rescue official, Stefan Schneider, told a televised news conference that a doctor was in the cave, but it wasn't clear when he could get to the patient. 'It's going round the clock, and it's going to last a few more days,' Mr Schneider said. Rescuers working in several small teams of up to four people each have laid a telephone line several hundred metres along the route to help with their efforts. Others have set up camps inside the cave system, which lies on the border with Austria. Fifty-two cave rescue specialists from Bavaria, 28 from Austria and some from Switzerland were at the scene.","German cave researcher, 52, was hurt yesterday while exploring the cave .

"Marine experts today warned people not to enter the water after . two killer whales were spotted 100 yards off the English coast.

A mother and calf were spotted off the coast of Padstow in Cornwall and experts warned the giant whale may inadvertently harm a human or attack while protecting its young (library image of an Orca in Scotland) Peter Richardson, of the Marine Conservation Society, said: 'Obviously we wouldn't recommend getting into the water with a killer . whale. 'They . are enormous super predators and are therefore unpredictable. 'There . is a pod of killer whales in Scotland and they could be travelling around the . country. 'Not a lot is known about the movements of killer whales . but the probability is they are here for food. 'There . are plenty of seals along the south coast especially around Padstow and . Newquay.' Several people have reportedly seen the . whales, a rare sight in the area, over the last ten days. Ocean scientist Dom Clarke, 25, saw what he believes was a mother and calf near Trevose Head, five miles from Padstow (pictured) while walking along the cliff . Ocean scientist Dom Clarke, 25, saw what . he believes was the mother and calf near Trevose Head, five miles from Padstow . while walking along the cliff. He said he saw them heading south towards . Newquay. Mr Clarke told how he came across a man with binoculars . who asked him what species of whale he thought they were. 'I thought ""wow, that is pretty unusual to . see"", so I grabbed the binoculars,' he said. 'At the time they were heading south along . the coast about 100 metres off the headland. It was pretty special.' He added that a bird watcher had said he . spotted the whales near Trevose the following day. Fisherman Zyg Gregorek, who has travelled the world hunting . fearsome sea predators, said: 'All sea predators present a danger. Killer whales (Orcinus orca), also known . as orcas, can grow up to 32ft in length and weigh up to 9 tonnes. The . distinctive triangular dorsal fin can grow up to 6ft high. They are mainly found around Iceland, . Norway and northern Scotland, but occasionally some are seen as far south as . the Atlantic coasts of Spain and Portugal and east into the Mediterranean. 'If a . swimmer or a surfer got too close to a killer whale, it only takes one swish of . the tail and you've had it. 'A killer whale might be curious around . humans and therefore might attack, whether by accident or design. Also, because of over-fishing, their diets have been affected. 'If they are starving, they can be unpredictable and there is a possibility . they may go for a human. Tom Hardy, of the Cornwall Wildlife Trust, said: 'I remember . there were reports of a killer whale attacking a basking shark in Cornwall . years ago. 'But attacks on humans are extremely rare. You would be . very unlucky to get attacked by one.' According to the SeaWatch Foundation, killer . whale sightings are rare in the waters off the coast of South West England, . with most sightings between March and September. The whales were seen just 15 miles from the surfing mecca of Newquay . In September last year, a holidaymaker at . the Bedruthan Steps Hotel at Mawgan Porth, around eight miles south of Trevose, . spotted a pod of four killer whales while eating breakfast in the cliff-top . hotel. Mr Clarke, who runs a rockpool exploration . and education company, Explore the Shore, suggested that the whales could have . been feeding locally. 'At the moment there must be a lot of fish . inshore. And that day there was also a really huge shoal of porpoises about a . kilometre off the headland,' he said. Angie Gall, marine conservation officer . with the Cornwall Wildlife Trust, said the whales may have merely . passed through the area en route to more northerly waters around Scotland. 'There is only evidence of one ""kill"" made . by killer whales in Cornish waters and that was a basking shark,"" she said. Basking sharks are known to congregate in . huge numbers off the Cornish coast in the summer and are a familiar sight for . tourists in the area.","Sightings at Padstow, just 15 miles from surfing mecca of Newquay ."
"Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale has insisted he is not racist and deeply regrets his tirade towards Lancashire batsman Ashwell Prince. Gale was banned for the final two matches of the LV= County Championship season - missing the chance to lift the Championship trophy - after reportedly calling South African Prince a 'f***ing Kolpak' during the Roses clash at Old Trafford last month. But it was the England and Wales Cricket Board's investigation into whether there was a racist element to the verbal attack that led to what Gale has described as 'the toughest time' of his career in an interview with the Yorkshire Post. The incident, during which Gale called Ashwell Prince a 'f***ing Kolpak', led to 'the toughest time' in his career . The Yorkshire captain was not originally allowed to celebrate with his team after leading them to the title . Gale's use of the word 'Kolpak' - shorthand for a band of overseas players who utilise an obscure employment law to play in England without restriction - was at the root of the charge, but the ECB's case collapsed when Prince insisted he did not consider the comments to be racist. Subsequently, Gale has been handed a further two-match ban and ordered to complete an anger management course, but he revealed it was the suggestion he was racist that has hurt him most during the saga. 'At a time when it should have been one of the happiest times of my career, it's turned out to be the toughest time,' he told the newspaper. Gale says he regrets the outburst but has been hurt by being branded a racist by the ECB . Gale was eventually allowed to celebrate Yorkshire's win, but is upset at having the moment spoiled . 'I am not a racist, and that tag was what hurt me most throughout the whole process.' He added: 'There were times when I didn't want to leave the house after being branded a racist, but my family showed me great support that helped me through.' Gale's additional ban will mean he misses the curtain-raiser to the English season when champions Yorkshire take on MCC in Abu Dhabi next spring and he will also be unavailable for the first county championship fixture. The 30-year-old, who has captained Yorkshire since 2009, is now hoping to put the episode behind him. The 30-year-old has captained his county since 2009 and led them to their first Championship in 13 years . 'I regret the way in which I reacted that day and I have always prided myself on being a role model to my fellow pros and all young cricketers I coach,' he said. 'I'd like to think that I have always played the game hard but fair, and I always endeavour to play every game to win. 'I am still immensely proud of what we have achieved this season and I hope the whole situation hasn't detracted from Yorkshire's success.

"Patrick Lambie's late long-range penalty consigned New Zealand to just their second defeat in 38 Test matches as South Africa edged to a 27-25 Rugby Championship victory at Ellis Park. New Zealand had expected Dane Coles' first Test try that overturned an 11-point deficit to tie up victory in Johannesburg. Replacement Lambie posted the last-gasp penalty winner though, to stop the All Blacks extending their unbeaten run in the Rugby Championship to 18 matches.

South Africa led for the majority of the clash thanks to two tries from Handre Pollard and another score from Francois Hougaard. The All Blacks hit back to lead 25-24 in the final quarter however, with Ben Smith and Coles adding to Malakai Fekitoa's earlier score. South Africa always had time to respond though, and despite missing a snap drop-goal effort, Lambie was on target with the crucial penalty. New Zealand went into their closing Rugby Championship clash with their 13th title already secured, but Steve Hansen's men were dead-set on extending their impressive record of losing just once since World Cup 2011. Captain Richie McCaw was unable to toast his record 134th All Blacks bow with victory, the stalwart flanker breaking Colin Meads' 43-year-old appearance tally. Instead South Africa were able to secure their first victory over the All Blacks under boss Heyneke Meyer in what will be seen as a clear statement of intent with World Cup 2015 hurtling into view. Beauden Barrett's penalty handed New Zealand an early 3-0 lead, but South Africa hit back in style. eNew Zealand players perform the traditional haka dance ahead of the contest .

But South Africa broke away again, this time with Pollard powering home for an impressive solo score, before converting his try. Malakai Fekitoa hit back for the stubborn All Blacks however, as the visitors battled to stay in touch. Wing Julian Savea's astute chip eased pressure on New Zealand after the Springboks pack had stolen a scrum nudge. Fekitoa then scythed a fine midfield line to outfox the home defence and cross under the posts. Barrett added the conversion to leave New Zealand trailing by just a point for the second time in the match. Just as the All Blacks looked to turn the tables however, Pollard claimed his second try of the match, converting again, to put the Springboks 21-13 to the good at the break.

Barrett posted the conversion to leave the All Blacks trailing 24-20 with 14 minutes to play. Front-rower Coles then plundered his first Test try to make it 25-24 and fire the All Blacks ahead for the first time since Barrett's eighth-minute opening penalty. The visitors were unable to add the conversion though, and that miss proved telling.

"Sam Davies is recalling the December day in 2008 when the unique challenges of offshore sailing came into sharp focus. She was racing in the Vendee Globe, arguably the world’s toughest endurance event. It’s the solo round-the-world race where Ellen MacArthur made her name; a race where half the boats that start typically do not finish. Davies was close to Australia when she got the emergency call. She had been one of the three blondes in Britain’s Olympic boat, but walked away before the 2004 gold because ‘I wanted the adventure of offshore sailing’ — now she was being asked to help a French rival who had snapped his thigh bone. Sam Davies of Team SCA looks on as the fleet comes back to the dock early morning after a practice leg . Davies speaks to media on the dock ahead of the Volvo Ocean Race - a marathon spanning 38,739 miles . ‘He had been hit by a big wave, suffered this awful injury, and I was one of two boats called by the organisers to help him,’ Davies says. ‘He was completely rooted to the spot inside the cabin and hundreds of miles from land. If he moved he might have severed his femoral artery so he was lying in agony and alone on that boat for about 48 hours. ‘He couldn’t reach his morphine or any supplies. The other boat reached him first and was trying to throw a bag with medicine down the hatch but couldn’t. Transferring him from boat to boat wasn’t an option. Thank god he was in the catchment area for the Australian navy, because that is the only reason he is alive.’ All this came just days after Davies had smashed her elbow and fallen unconscious on deck in the middle of a big ocean. She finished fourth that year, the second-best placing for a woman in the race’s history, but followed it by snapping her mast early in the next edition in 2012. ‘The ocean can be a tricky, dangerous place,’ Davies says. ‘But the fun is in the challenge, right?’ Davies, from Portsmouth, is in Alicante, Spain getting ready for another challenge. The 39-year-old has been named skipper of Team SCA, the first all-female team to enter the Volvo Ocean Race since 2002. It’s a brutal slog around the world that runs every three years, a marathon spanning 38,739 miles and which represents the pinnacle of offshore racing. The first leg starts on October 11 — a 6,487-mile race to Cape Town — with the cream of the world’s sailors in opposition. Team SCA's Davies: ‘The ocean can be a tricky, dangerous place. But the fun is in the challenge, right?’ They race yachts that can travel close to 600 miles in 24 hours, the sailors burning upwards of 5,000 calories a day for three weeks at a time, sustained on a diet of desalinated water and rehydrated powder food. The suggestion that sailors cut their toothbrushes in half to save weight is a myth, but it’s not far off reality. ‘My bag has four changes of sailing gear to last a month at sea and my iPod,’ says Davies, whose crew includes four other British women. It is a race of attrition and speed, usually won by the team that sustains the least damage to bodies and boat. The difficulty is told by the scars of the current fleet. A Dutch skipper, Bouwe Bekking, was forced to abandon his sinking boat in 2006; the Australian Chris Nicholson pulled out in 2009 when he ruptured knee ligaments. There is also Gerd Jan Poortman, on Bekking’s boat, who broke his back in this event. ‘We were told recently that we’ve each lifted in excess of one million kilos in weights to prepare,’ Davies says. ‘The extreme physicality is why women have not been around in the past three editions. The boats got more powerful. ‘Now the rules permit us to carry 11 women whereas a male crew carries eight. That’s three extra brains. Will it make up the strength and experience gap? Let’s see. We’ve left no stone unturned. If we do well, then hopefully we won’t have to wait long until women are back in this race. We are going to challenge some perceptions, to show we belong.’ To say Davies belongs on the water is an understatement. Team SCA skipper Davies talks with Torben Grael ahead of the Friday's practice ahead of the big race . Her grandfather was a decorated submarine commander in World War Two, whose St Christopher’s charm she wears round her neck at sea. By the age of three, her family were on voyages in their small yacht to France. ‘This race would start in the Solent and I went every time,’ she says. ‘I remember Tracy Edwards’s all-women team in 1989. She was my hero. I got a message from Tracy recently saying I was her daughter’s hero and that kind of brought home to me what we are about to do.’ Davies studied engineering at Cambridge. ‘I was always going off sailing,’ she says. ‘I went away once and got hit by massive storm in the Bay of Biscay. I had told uni I was ill, but my mum gave the game away by calling them to say we were being rescued by a lifeboat and I was going to miss an exam.’ Davies ended up as part of Shirley Robertson’s crew preparing for the 2004 Olympics, one of the original blondes in the boat. But rounding buoys was not enough to satisfy her. ‘Shirley gave me an ultimatum because I was always finding an excuse to go offshore,’ Davies says. ‘I made the decision to leave.’ The team went on to gold; Davies joined the tough world of French solo sailing. She made a greater impact in France than almost any other British sailor before or since. ‘I don’t regret leaving the Olympic programme,’ she says. ‘I don’t think they would have won with me and I need adventure.’ That sense has taken her to the Volvo Ocean Race and a battle of the sexes. ‘We are here to compete,’ she says. ‘And like I say, the fun is in the challenge.’ Team SCA leader Davies speaks during the skippers' press conference in Alicante, Spain, on Friday . **The team is sponsored by SCA, the global hygiene and forest products company .","Sam Davies, from Portsmouth, is  getting ready to act as skipper of Team SCA - the first all-female team to enter the Volvo Ocean Race since 2002 .

"It was when Lewis Moody met up with his former England team-mates earlier this week that it struck him just how much he had missed rugby and how glad he is to be back in the game again. On Wednesday night, the 36-year-old was among familiar faces at the Dorchester Hotel in London to take his place at Jonny Wilkinson’s testimonial dinner. The following evening, he was a world away from that glittering occasion, taking training at Bradford-on-Avon RFC in his new role as the club’s director of rugby. For the ex-Leicester and Bath flanker, World Cup-winner and decorated Lion, this is the grass-roots role which has given him a taste of coaching that he is relishing, and a route back into the cut and thrust of a sporting life. It may be several rungs below the level he occupied during his playing career, but he is embracing the earthier surroundings of Southern Counties League South. Lewis Moody looks onto the pitches at Bradford-on-Avon RFC, where he is director of rugby . Spending an evening with the men he used to stand shoulder to shoulder with in the Test arena reminded Moody about the joys of a sporting life. ‘Seeing all those guys again, they’re all doing totally different things,’ he said. ‘It’s quite strange. But when you get back into that circle again, it makes you miss rugby so much. This really gives me the connection to the game that I need.’ Moody lives in Bradford-on-Avon, having spent the last years of his playing career at nearby Bath. This venture into coaching began with taking his children to the club for minis rugby and going along to train there with his brother-in-law. That led to some coaching input and during the summer, he was asked if the ad hoc arrangement could become more formal. ‘I thought, “I love it here and I love being involved in rugby again”,’ he said. ‘I had been out of it for two years and this is much more of a grass-roots level, but the guys have so much enthusiasm. ‘You realise that you can’t have a professional mind-set, because all these lads have jobs. We’ve got labourers, teachers, sportsmen, students, architects, all sorts — a really wide range of guys here. There’s a full spectrum here, then you’ve got private schools, local schools, all sorts of backgrounds. ‘The first time I came along to training there were eight or nine guys, now we get regularly over 20, which is fantastic. It’s an opportunity for me to get back into the sport I love and give a bit back. I’m really enjoying it.’ There was a strong turn-out on Thursday for a session on the floodlit pitch. Moody held a coaches’ meeting in the clubhouse first, then went out to take charge of training. He is swiftly discovering that, in the amateur game, his official title covers a vast remit. Former England captain Moody made an ad hoc arrangement at the club permanent in the summer . Moody is relishing his connection to grassroots rugby and his first coaching role . ‘I’m director of rugby, which covers a lot of bases — trying to organise the club a little bit more so that it is unified across the board, to create more of a one-club identity,’ he said. ‘There are a lot of teams here and I’m just trying to align them a little bit better, so we can compete. The guys have come up this year from the division below and it’s tough for them. They have lost the first couple of games but it’s not about being a professional club. It’s about creating a strong club that everyone enjoys being part of and make it an important part of the community. ‘The club has only been going about 25 years and the guys running it have done a great job. Now it’s about taking that next step, to get more players along and get everyone enjoying their rugby. Hopefully me being here will help — guys will want to come along to see what I’m doing here.’ What he is doing is running his Mad Dog Sport coaching clinics at the club for junior players — enlisting the help of friends and contacts such as Dan Hipkiss, Lee Mears, Andy Robinson and Stuart Hooper — as well as taking charge of the first XV. There are obvious challenges for someone with Moody’s elite background, but he is learning to adapt. ‘There are certain things that you just see as normal, like lifting for kick-offs and in the lineout,’ he said. ‘As a professional player, that sort of thing is all part of the routine, but you are sort of starting from the beginning here. At first, I gave them far too much information, so I’m trying to rein myself back in again. VIDEO Scroll down to see Moody's team-mate Wilkinson drop the Rugby World Cup trophy . Moody proudly holds the William Webb Ellis Trophy after winning the Rugby World Cup in 2003 . Moody (left) and Josh Lewsey (right) embrace loved ones after their victory at Telstra Stadium in Sydney . ‘The guys are picking it all up really quickly. They are enthused by me being here but I am enthused by them, too — they just probably don’t realise that!’ Moody is sufficiently enthused by his experience so far to be open-minded about where it might take him. Having been busy with various projects since retiring as a player, he had not shown an inclination to explore a full-time coaching career, but now he wouldn’t rule it out. ‘I don’t know,’ he said, when asked about the possibility. ‘When I retired, I stepped away from the game because I had been in it 17 years and I didn’t want my life to just revolve around the game every weekend. Coming here has got me enthused about the management side of the game and coaching. At the minute I love it. If something comes of it then great, but I just love it for what it is at the moment.’ Moody in action against Australia at Subiaco Oval in Perth in 2010 . Moody (right) celebrates a Heineken Cup quarter-final win with Leicester team-mate Geordan Murphy . His new role has already thrown up one difficult scenario. As a prominent supporter of the Mail on Sunday’s concussion campaign, Moody is well aware of the threat posed by the issue and he had to confront it in Bradford’s season opener at Walcot. ‘In our first game, we had two concussions,’ he said. ‘One of the guys stepped out of the line and smashed someone with a great hit, which stopped a try, but he knocked himself out cold. There was me thinking, “There’s a decision to be made here” but there was no real decision to be made, we knew he had to come off. ‘When someone questioned what he was going to do the next week, I just said, “He’s having three weeks off, no contact, then we’ll assess him again”. Trouble is; now that he’s not allowed to do contact for a bit, he’s stopped coming to training! ‘The other one wasn’t quite as bad — he was sat on the ground feeling a bit dizzy. You realise how difficult it is for doctors, because he’s on the sideline saying, “I’m fine, I’m ready to go back on”. We just have one physio from Bath University, but we’re lucky because a lot of teams at this level don’t even have that.’ It was an early test of Moody’s ability to handle the decision-making demands of management. He handled it well. There will be others. It will be a learning process, but he’s just glad to be back in the game again. 1 Trevor Woodman . Gloucester scrum coach. 2 Steve Thompson .

"Sporting Lisbon teenager Ryan Gauld has won his first international call-up to Gordon Strachan's Scotland squad. The 18-year-old, dubbed 'Mini-Messi', is the only Scot still remaining in this season's Champions League after being named in Sporting's squad to face Chelsea on Tuesday. The former Dundee United starlet has seen his football career fast-tracked this term and gets his first senior call-up after starring for the Under 21 side. Ryan Gauld has been handed his first international call-up by Scotland boss Gordon Strachan . The 18-year-old was named in Sporting Lisbon's Champions League squad to face Chelsea . Gauld scored twice to help Billy Stark’s side end their European Championship campaign on a high with a 3-0 win in Luxembourg. The youngster signed a six-year contract with the Portuguese giants in the summer, which includes an eye catching buy-out clause of £47.8million. Gauld is one of two players, along with Stevie May, to be lined up for a debut when Scotland play European Championship qualifiers against Georgia and Poland. Aberdeen defender Mark Reynolds is among just three Scottish-based players in the pool alongside Celtic pair Craig Gordon and Scott Brown.

"Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen believes Mauricio Pochettino is beginning to get to grips with his job at White Hart Lane after an inconsistent start to his reign. The 42-year-old, who left Southampton over the summer to take charge of the north London club, has experienced mixed results since moving to the capital.

"Scottish Football Association performance director Mark Wotte insists Ryan Gauld has no reason to worry - despite being demoted to Sporting Lisbon's B team. The former Dundee United playmaker sealed a £3million move to the Portuguese giants earlier this summer. But boss Marco Silva has sent the 21-year-old to play with the Lions' second string after admitting Gauld was struggling to adapt to life at his new club. Learning curve: Ryan Gauld (right) chats to Sporting Lisbon team-mate Mahmoud Shikabala having arrived at the Portuguese club for £3million from Dundee United earlier this summer . Wotte, though, insists the Scotland Under 21 star is in good hands. Speaking at Heriott Watt University as the third intake of youngsters were welcomed into the Scottish Football Association's Performance Schools system, the Dutchman said: 'Playing for a club like Sporting Lisbon who have a history of creating world-class players is exciting for Ryan. 'He has been moved into their B squad but perhaps the B squad in Lisbon is better than the first-team squad at Dundee United. 'He will still be training with their A squad players on a daily basis and that will help him improve as well. 'I think it is a clever move from Sporting as it will make sure he can play a game every week and help him settle in. Marked man: Gauld emerged as a promising youngster at Dundee United in 2012 . For the future: SFA Performance Director Mark Wotte (right), standing by Scotland boss Gordon Strachan, has stated Gauld has nothing to worry about despitebeing demoted to Sporting Lisbon's B team . 'The rule in Portugal is that you can play for Sporting Lisbon A 72 hours after you have played for the B team. 'So there is nothing wrong with what they have done. They are very clever at talent management and they know what they are doing. 'There is definitely nothing for Ryan to worry about at this stage. He is just starting out over there. If he is still playing for Sporting Lisbon B in two years' time, then he should be worried.'","Ryan Gauld joined Sporting Lisbon for £3million from Dundee United .

"Nicolas Anelka may have left West Brom six months ago, but the controversy that led to his sacking is still following him. Anelka signed up to the new Indian Super League on Monday, and on Tuesday afternoon his new club Mumbai City took to Twitter to welcome their high-profile striker. But the Indian side attempted to remove Anelka's time in the West Midlands from the history books, listing his former clubs only until his departure from Juventus, where he spent six months on loan. Mumbai City's tweet subtly removed Anelka's time at West Brom from his list of clubs. It was soon deleted . The quenelle gesture performed by Nicolas Anelka in December 2013 led to his sacking by West Brom . The tweet, which also ignored Anelka's time with Shanghai Shenhua, presented the French striker as a combination of speed and firepower, and was deleted soon after. Anelka was sacked by West Brom in March 2014 after performing the controversial 'quenelle' gesture whilst celebrating a goal against West Ham three months earlier. The gesture is widely accepted to be anti-semitic, and although Anelka denied that he intended it to be understood as such, he was given a five-match ban from football which he is yet to serve. Former France international Nicolas Anelka scored two goals in his eleven games for West Brom .

"From a kick-about in the local park to teaming up in a vital international years later is fanciful material usually reserved solely for the dreams of Scottish youngsters. Andrew Robertson and Ryan Gauld are on the brink of pulling off the feat within six months. It was only back in April that Robertson and Gauld posed for a team picture with their then Tannadice buddies John Souttar and Joe McGovern at Magdalene Green in Dundee after a jumpers-for-goalposts session. The former Tayside flatmates will be reunited on Monday, with the Scotland squad’s plush Mar Hall training base their home for the week. Ryan Gauld in action for Scotland's Under-19 team and the youngster could star for the seniors soon . Andrew Robertson (left) celebrates during his time at Dundee United before moving to Hull City . Then, on Saturday, Robertson and Gauld could link up for the first time since going their separate, lucrative ways in the summer. Ibrox will be the stage when Gordon Strachan’s side goes out to secure a European Championship qualifying victory against Georgia. Around £6million changed hands for the pair during the close season. Robertson, 20, has starred for Hull City in the Barclays Premier League, while Gauld is being brought along steadily with Sporting Lisbon’s B squad since leaving Dundee United. The 18-year-old’s tentative start to life in Portugal didn’t stop Strachan rewarding him with a first senior call-up last Tuesday. The news came as a welcome surprise to Robertson, who can’t wait to make a dream come true. ‘It would be brilliant to be out there playing in the same Scotland team as Ryan,’ said Robertson. ‘We shared a flat together and were close at Dundee United. We’ve been away from each other and I would love to see him make his debut and earn a cap. ‘Everyone loves playing for their country and we’ve done it at the age levels. Hopefully there’s much more to come from both of us playing in the senior team. ‘It came as a surprise to see him named. I don’t know if he knew or not and was just keeping it from me. But I’m delighted for him. ‘It’s brilliant he’s taken a big step in moving to another country, learning a new language — I’m sure he’s looking forward to speaking to us Scots again! ‘He thoroughly deserves the call-up. I am sure he’ll make a great impression and put his stamp on the training ground work that we do with the manager.’ Gauld’s promotion arrives only a month after he scored his first Under-21 goals, against Luxembourg, the type of fast-track route with which Robertson is familiar. He took all of two months at Dundee United to earn a call-up from Billy Stark last October and, by early March, he made his debut for the senior team in a friendly victory in Poland. ‘It would be brilliant to be out there playing in the same Scotland team as Ryan,’ says  Robertson (pictured) Gauld (pictured) and Robertson shared a flat together and were close friends at Dundee United . That doesn’t indicate the Scotland manager is acting in haste, however. Robertson was, on occasion, borrowed for use in training games last season by Strachan and, as he explains, the national boss is fond of using time off the coaching field to create a personal connection while a new young recruit is assessed among the establishment. ‘The most important thing is on the training ground,’ said Strachan, whose other uncapped call-up is Sheffield Wednesday’s Stevie May. ‘Can they play with good players or do good players intimidate them? Do they buy into what we are doing? Is their style of play all right for it? 'And then, it’s really about them. Have they got a brother, a sister? Where are your mum and dad from? Just basic chat to get to know them better, before they come in cold. ‘I don’t know too much about Ryan. I have seen him play but I don’t know him as a kid. I’ve never sat down with him, never had him in a training session. If you look at my squads, I like to have younger ones now and then. Come on then, let’s have a look at you, get together so, in the future, it’s no big shock.’ That was an approach which sat well with Robertson when he found himself propelled into the international arena a week before his 20th birthday and eight months after leaving amateur football behind at Queen’s Park. ‘The most important thing is on the training ground,’ admits Scotland manager Gordon Strachan . Strachan, the Scotland boss, is fond of using time off the coaching field to create a personal connection . ‘If the manager decides it’s time for Ryan, one of the best prospects in Scotland — if not the best — to come into the group and get started, then the timing must be right,’ said Robertson. ‘I think he’ll deal with it and show what he can do on the pitch and in training. ‘When I got called in for the Poland game, it was quite daunting. I didn’t know anyone at that time. Ever since I set foot in the hotel, the manager spoke to me quite a lot to see how I was doing. I talked to him and (Scotland assistant manager) Mark McGhee in one-on-ones. 'He obviously gains quite a lot from having those conversations and getting to know you a bit better on a personal level, what you are like off the pitch. ‘I guess he will do the same with Ryan. Also, in team meetings, he gets it across so very well. Everyone in the squad knows what he expects both as an individual and from the team. ‘I was lucky enough to make my debut in Poland and, hopefully, I repaid that trust on the pitch.’ A start against Nigeria in May followed that substitute appearance in Warsaw and, as a quickly established member of Steve Bruce’s top-flight line-up, was all set to continue his rise through the ranks with a competitive Scotland debut against Germany last month. Robertson (pictured) says youngster Gauld is ‘one of the best prospects in Scotland - if not the best' Gauld joined Portuguese club Sporting Lisbon from Dundee United in 2014 for a reported £3million . Potential Scotland star Gauld during a training session in Portugal for new club Sporting Lisbon . Agonisingly, a calf tear 10 minutes from the end of his club’s game at Aston Villa put paid to his participation against the World Cup winners. Robertson dutifully turned up for Scotland service in the vain hope of finding a way to make the plane but a scan confirmed all the fears that he would require a 10-day rest. That injury strain was then put to the test by solo celebrations at his new Hull home when Ikechi Anya’s brilliant finish past Manuel Neuer gave Scotland hope of pinching an opening-night point from the section’s most difficult fixture. ‘It almost made it harder being around the squad because I could feel the buzz and everyone was looking forward to the game,’ said Robertson. ‘I was desperate to get out there and get involved ahead of such a big game. It was unfortunate I couldn’t. ‘The only positive was that I wasn’t out too long and was able to get back for the next Hull league game. I caught the tear early and didn’t make it worse. ‘I was in Hull and watched it by myself in the house, cheering on the boys. I wished I was back in Scotland to see it in a local pub or something and see all the reactions. I was OK, I was out the squad and there was nothing I could do about it. But it was harder watching and knowing I could have been involved. I thought the boys did brilliantly. Robertson hopes to make the Germany match but a scan confirmed that he would require a 10-day rest . ‘I thought “Kech” scored an amazing goal because you saw him running through and, having all that time to think about being one-on-one with perhaps the best goalkeeper in the world, then he kept his composure. It was unfortunate we couldn’t hold on to a point. Maybe it just shows in the end when it’s world-class players like Thomas Muller you’re up against and he scores two goals.’ Sergio Aguero, David Silva and Edin Dzeko were among the World Cup stars Robertson was confronted by last weekend against Manchester City when, after an encouraging start to the season, Hull met with their second defeat of the campaign. The Scot has certainly not looked out of his depth, though, as he adjusts to the step up in class — his trademark raids up the left flank and unerring deliveries into the penalty box have transferred themselves to his new environment and even provided the opener in Saturday’s 2-0 defeat of Crystal Palace. He will bring solid English top-flight form to the left-back position for Scotland’s matches against Georgia then Poland. ‘I have not put in a complete performance yet,’ he continued. ‘Hopefully I can do that soon but so far I’m pleased. It’s a great league to play in and I’ve enjoyed every game. But I know I can show a lot more. ‘The manager has been brilliant with me, helped me through a lot already and tweaked things in my game. I know I’m still young, so that’s what has to happen. ‘I’d say the tempo would be the biggest difference and it’s much more physical. So I need to work on my fitness, be a lot quicker. I’m learning a lot with better players around me. ‘I’m trying in the gym to build up and get stronger but I don’t want to do too much too soon. It’s a gradual improvement we’re looking for and I’ll just keep on doing my program and, hopefully, see the results.’","Ryan Gauld and Andrew Robertson, both formerly of Dundee United, now play at Sporting Lisbon and Hull City respectively .

"A white Christmas could save Britain from a double-dip recession, Treasury forecasters have said. A huge bout of snow will skew economic . activity so that we do not experience two successive quarters of . negative growth - the technical definition of recession. A big freeze in the run up to December 31 will stop us going out to the shops but we will start buying again in the new year, it has been predicted. Cold comfort: Treasury forecasters have said that snowfall before Christmas could stop a double-dip recession. Here commuters travel through heavy snow on the A66 near Appleby, Cumbria on Monday . Christmas white out? Britain experienced it's first bout of snowfall this winter this week on high ground and in parts of the north. Here a farmer clears his gate in Cowshill, County Durham . Professor Stephen Nickell, a member of the Office for Budget Responsibility, said that snow will delay spending but not prevent it. 'If you have a huge bout of heavy snow before Christmas that will probably rule out a double-dip recession because GDP will fall in the fourth quarter and bounce back in the first quarter,' he told the Telegraph. But he added that a big freeze needed to come in the current quarter and not early in the new year. Although recession may be avoided, snowfall before December 31 would merely alter spending patterns and not reinvigorate the economy. Banks will bid against each other to obtain the 30 day loan . The Office for Budget Responsibility has said there is a one-in-three chance of a double-dip recession. However, they admitted that . the uncertain outlook in the single currency bloc meant its economic . forecasts for Britain were in part based on guess work. The watchdog said the UK outlook was ‘extremely uncertain’ and the Government could not count on its latest predictions. They last week slashed its growth . forecasts for 2012 from 2.5 per cent to just 0.7 per cent – throwing . George Osborne’s plans to cut the deficit into disarray. OBR chief Robert Chote said the . forecasts were based on the assumption that bank lending will return to . more normal levels in the next two years. ‘But we are only too happy to admit . that that is very uncertain and a guess,’ added Stephen Nickell, who . sits on the OBR with Mr Chote. ‘Banks do not trust each other very much and are extremely nervous about lending to each other,’ said Professor Nickell. ‘We have to make some assumptions . about when this is going to end. Basically, that is a guess. We don’t . have any more inside information than anybody else on that matter.’ It came during heated exchanges with MPs on the Treasury Select Committee in the wake of last week’s autumn statement. Senior Conservative Andrew Tyrie, . chairman of the committee, said there was ‘scepticism and caution’ among . MPs about the OBR’s forecasting record – particularly after the sharp . downgrades since March. ‘If you were so wrong in March how do we know you are right now?’ asked MP Michael Fallon. ‘You don’t,’ replied Professor Nickell. ‘We are talking about the future. No one knows the future.’ In an attempt to stave off a second brutal credit crunch which could tip the economy over the brink, the Bank of England yesterday offered to flood the economy with emergency funds. Billions of pounds of loans will be made available to the banking system to tackle ‘exceptional stresses in financial markets,’ it said. A new facility of the Bank of England will offer banks 30-day sterling liquidity on an ad hoc basis. This runs in line with their efforts to boost global liquidity . The launch of the crisis lending facility came as the eurozone was warned that its rescue fund could be stripped of its gold-plated AAA credit rating – leaving it dangerously short of firepower to bailout debt ridden countries. Lending between banks and to households and businesses threatens to dry up as the debt storm in the eurozone sparks panic around the world. Downing Street recently warned that a second credit crunch is underway and the Bank of England has said that British lenders face a ‘systemic crisis’. The Bank of England hopes its latest move will keep money flowing around the financial system and prevent a rerun of the credit crunch of 2007 that tipped the economy into recession. It came just a week after six central banks around the world – including in Britain, Europe and America – acted together to make it cheaper and easier to borrow dollars. Pre-Christmas snow: Hills in Cowshill, County Durham are covered in the white stuff on Monday . David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas in London, warned that if the ‘current market tensions continue into 2012’ it will be a ‘real struggle’ for banks to raise funds. He said the action by central banks was ‘positive’ to ease short-term funding problems but ‘will not do a lot for the longer-term issues’. The cost of mortgages and business loans is already rising amid worries about borrowers being able to repay. A full-blown credit crunch next year would leave many households and small businesses starved of cash. Ratings agency Standard & Poor’s added to the gloom with a warning that the eurozone bailout fund has a one-in-two chance of losing its credit rating. It said the European Financial Stability Facility depends on the creditworthiness of the single currency’s six AAA rated countries – Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland and Luxembourg. Having said on Monday night that there was a 50-50 chance that each of those countries would lose their top-notch ratings, S&P last night said the EFSF was also vulnerable. Leaders have so far failed to increase the size of the bailout fund from £378 billion to £860 billion and it is feared that a downgrade could effectively kill it off. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said: ‘There are already major question marks over whether it is going to raise the sort of money that is hoped. If it loses its AAA rating it has to pay more to raise funds and finds it more difficult.’ The downgrade of Germany would be particularly dangerous for the Eurozone as it could also call into question the EFSF’s permanent replacement – the European Stability Mechanism. That would further hinder the Eurozone’s ability to support debt-ridden countries such as Italy and Spain and shore up the single currency.","Snow before new year will delay spending until January so economy will decline now but bounce back .

"Under blue skies on the Fingal coast on Tuesday, Martin O’Neill jested how he was ‘in the dark’ about Roy Keane’s latest book of revelations, and happy to be there. A few yards away, Keane, clad in knee-length white socks, beany hat and a prospector’s beard, held a toddler in his arms and posed for photographs. All was sweetness and light as an Irish training session finished on a golden October morn. Or was it? Roy Keane made the headlines this week after the release of his controversial updated autobiography . Martin O'Neill, pictured with Roy Keane last year, admits he is in the dark about his assistant's new book . Appearances, after all, can be deceptive. Consider the cover of Keane’s book. He’s clean-cut and close-cropped; in contrast to his current Wildman of Borneo image, which O’Neill referred to as ‘bedraggled.’ Perhaps Keane will shave for Thursday’s launch in the Aviva Stadium; perhaps he won’t. As he admits in his book, he’s a furrow full of frets. ‘Sometimes, I don’t know what role I’m supposed to be playing,’ he writes. ‘I’m a family man. I’m a Cork man, a TV pundit. I’m a critic. I was a player with a skinhead,’ he says wryly. Where O’Neill is concerned, Keane’s ‘role’ is simple. It’s about working with the Republic of Ireland players, and helping them become better, nothing more, nothing less. It’s a part-time gig now, since Keane hitched up with Lambert’s Wanderly Wagon at Aston Villa– that’s Paul, not Eugene. Not that O’Neill seems to mind unduly. ‘Now that he (Keane) is with us, he’s getting (job) offers every day. There you go,’ noted O’Neill on Tuesday. Initially wary, O’Neill gradually warmed to the give and take nature of the interrogations over the explosive content of Keane’s latest manuscript. By the end, he was joshing about being out of the loop. Even so, despite the forthcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers, O’Neil knows there is only one show in town this week: Keano – The Sequel. Perhaps O’Neill is slightly perturbed by the spotlight on the musings of his assistant manager, and his pointed penmanship. If so, he’s keeping schtum. ‘People say is this a distraction? I don’t feel it,’ he insisted. ‘If it wasn’t a book it would be something else. It’s the nature of it in the build-up to matches here. It’s never been any different. So from that viewpoint, to me it’s not a distraction. I haven’t read it. Away from all the media attention Keane was busy putting the Ireland players through their paces on Tuesday . ‘It obviously was going to cause some sort of furore at some stage or another, the very fact he (Keane) put his name to this book would suggest that it's exactly what would happen. ‘It’s there and it doesn't matter. The games are the most important things for us,’ he stressed. Aware that humour can be a useful shield, O’Neill sought to shift the emphasis. ‘Let’s just say we came here and there hadn’t been a book, there would have been something else, seriously. ‘He (Keane) would have slipped down there on the field and we'd have been talking about that, maybe broken his leg or something like that. ‘There would have been something, there always is,’ he said. The Republic of Ireland take on Gibraltar on Saturday before facing world champions Germany on Tuesday . O'Neill believes people would be talking about Keane with or without the release of his new book this week . With a legal background, O’Neill is more interested in criminology than sporting chronicles and as of yesterday had yet to see it. ‘I haven’t read it; you may well come back to me in 36 hours if I have a look at it and say “it’s a major distraction” but I’m really comfortable I haven’t read it.’ Keane was offered the chance to manage Celtic having played for the Bhoys back in 2005 . As for Keane, he remains in tandem with O’Neill, of whom he writes glowingly in his book, which explains, in part, why he turned down the Celtic managerial job at the tail end of last season. Keane writes about being ‘all for loyalty’ and how he wasn’t ‘two minutes’ in the job with O’Neill when Celtic chief shareholder Dermot Desmond came knocking. If the Celtic job offer didn't 'rock my boat' Keane felt a stronger tug of allegiance to the man who offered him the chance to work in Irish football when people were steering clear of him. He writes how he shares the ‘same ideas’ with O’Neill as to how the game should be played.’ As Keane observes, the two men share many links. O’Neill managed Celtic, while Keane played there; they both managed Sunderland, both played under Brian Clough, they like American football and even have daughters with very similar names – Alana (O’Neill) and Alanna (Keane). Keane jokes of the coincidences: ‘That’s why he gave me the job.’ The reality is different. O’Neill sensed Keane’s love for football when they met on the managerial beat in the Premier League, and on the ITV couch, and felt the complex Corkonian could bring passion and drive to the Irish gig. For Keane, the chance to work as a number two – he says he never had any problem taking orders – and get back into football was too good to ignore. O'Neill, who has also worked with Keane as a pundit, sensed the former midfielder's love for the game . Yet Keane cannot be serious when he writes about being ‘under the radar a bit’ as Irish assistant manager. Under the radar? C’mon, Roy. It’s over 23 years since Keane played for the Irish U21s against England in Brentford, the night before the seniors drew 1-1 at Wembley. He was on the radar then and has never been off it, all beards, bust-ups, books and bookings, since.

"Daryl Janmaat insists he is speaking for the entire Newcastle dressing-room when he declares: ‘We do not want to get Alan Pardew sacked’. The Holland defender has been one of the few positives on the pitch this season following his £5million move from Feyenoord. United, though, remain in the bottom three and without a win in seven, leaving Pardew under pressure despite the support of owner Mike Ashley. Daryl Janmaat (right) has been one of Newcastle's few positives on the pitch since joining in the summer . But Janmaat has now come out and added his voice to those defending the manager, admitting that supporter unrest is something he chooses to block out. ‘The team is playing for the manager, we do not want him to get sacked, we want him here,’ said the 25-year-old. ‘He is good for us and we are fighting for him. I don’t listen to what the fans are chanting, I focus on playing the game.’ Janmaat joined from Dutch side Feyenoord, but has not been able to help Newcastle to a league win so far . Pardew and his players need a victory at home to Leicester City a week on Saturday to avoid becoming the first Newcastle side to go eight without a win from the start of a Premier League season. Janmaat – capped 23 times - was forced to withdraw from the Holland squad because of a slight hamstring injury this week but will be fit for the visit of the Foxes. And he believes a maiden win is in sight. Dutch international Janmaat insists the entire Newcastle dressing room is behind their much-maligned boss . ‘We have a very important game when we come back (from the international break) and that is a game we have to win,’ he added. ‘We must keep working hard and I hope the next sequence of games will see us pick up a few more points. ‘We feel like that win is close, we were pretty close against Swansea (Saturday’s 2-2 draw) and now we have to make sure we do it against Leicester. ‘You cannot say there is any lack of effort. The last couple of games we have just missed a little bit with our finishing and if we improve this and keep playing like this then the wins will come. He also remarked that he does not listen to the Newcastle fans' recent chants during matches . ‘We’re fighting really hard for each other.’ Meanwhile, the club’s plans for a new state-of-the-art training ground have been unanimously approved by planners. The Magpies intend to replace their existing facilities with a 3,600sq-m complex, including a gym, swimming pool, hydrotherapy pool, living and dining areas and outdoor barbecue zone.","Daryl Janmaat joined Newcastle from Feyenoord in the summer and has been one of the few positives on the pitch .

"Daley Blind only has to look as far as his father for the perfect role model, and the Manchester United midfielder admits he will attempt to mould himself on Danny Blind's leadership skills. Blind's father, who earned 42 caps for Holland as a defender and played for Ajax for 13 years, was described by United boss Louis van Gaal as a leader, and insisted the midfielder must become that on the field. Daley Blind (left) wants to model himself on his father Danny (right), who played 42 times for Holland . Daley moved from Ajax for £14million in the summer and has impressed overall with his performances so far, and Van Gaal suggested he is a better player than his father was. Danny Blind lifts the Amstel Dutch Cup in 1998 with Ajax, who he played for over 300 times. Danny played over 300 times for Ajax, winning five league titles, four Dutch cups, the Champions League, the UEFA Cup, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup. Van Gaal told the Manchester Evening News: 'Maybe his son is better (as a player) but he is still not a leader. But that is a process.' Blind later responded to Van Gaal's words, and said: 'I read it. I hope I become a bit of a leader like my dad was, but I am still young. I am still improving and this is a new era for me, coming to a new area. 'But I can be that (a leader). I have to learn it and have to keep it up but I am learning every day, including about being a leader.' Blind also admitted that while Van Gaal's training sessions are tough, the team are improving every game, with three wins in their last four games. 'I think the players are getting used to [Van Gaal’s methods]. The players like to work with him. Everyone is picking it up very well,' he added. 'Training is very hard and very serious and we improve every day and you could see that in the first half [of the 2-1 win] against Everton.' Blind should represent Holland for the 22nd time in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Kazakhstan on Friday. Blind has impressed overall with his performances in Manchester United's midfield .

The 26-year-old has started the last two Premier League games as well as the Champions League tie against Schalke after recovering from his World Cup exertions . And Willian, signed from Anzhi Makhachkala for £32million in 2013, admitted he was under pressure to keep his place. Brazilian Willian has started the last four games for Chelsea at home and in Europe . He said: 'I have to prove myself on a daily basis at Chelsea. I have to kill a lion each time and I am dedicated to that. This is an expression from Brazil.

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we learned from the Premier League and Football League this week, including how one Argentine is consigning another to distant memory at the Etihad. Click here to follow @ralphellis56 . 1) Carlos Tevez, once the biggest and most controversial name at Manchester City, continues to be pushed deeper into the club’s history books by the goal scoring of fellow Argentine Sergio Aguero. Match of the Day highlighted the fact that Aguero’s goal at Aston Villa – his 57th in the Premier League since arriving in England – made him at 114 minutes per strike the most frequent scorer in the League’s history. It also brought him to within two of the 59 struck for City by Tevez – at an average of 140 minutes wait per goal. Sergio Aguero celebrates after scoring in Manchester City's 2-0 win over Aston Villa . 2) Nathaniel Clyne can join the England squad this week knowing he’s beaten the persistent groin injury problems which he suffered during the second part of last season. He finished Southampton’s 1-0 defeat at Spurs as one of only nine Premier League outfield players to have played every minute in every competition for their club so far. The 23-year-old has not played so many matches in a row for nearly 18 months. Nathanial Clyne has overcome injury problems to be an ever present for Southampton this season . 3) Queens Park Rangers might be a tad too nice for the Premier League – Karl Henry’s booking near the end of the 2-0 defeat at West Ham was only the ninth collected in all competitions by Harry Redknapp’s side this season. That’s the lowest total of any top flight club – leaders Chelsea are far from having the worst disciplinary record, but the four yellow cards in their win over Arsenal took them to 20 in all competitions. Karl Henry (L) picked up a booking against West Ham but QPR have been far too timid this season . 4) Alan Pardew tried to get rid of Gabriel Obertan this summer but literally couldn’t give him away after the French winger, troubled by hamstring injuries and poor form, had played just 34 minutes of Premier League football all last season. The Toon boss might just end up being glad of that after the performance the 25-year-old gave at Swansea in his first top flight start of this campaign. The former Manchester United player, who has two seasons left on the five-year contract he signed at Newcastle in 2011, set up one goal and made two more chances with a bright right wing display. Gabriel Obertan (L) surprised Newcastle fans with an adventurous performance against Swansea . 5) Andrew Robertson wasn’t the most glamorous of Hull’s summer signings, but the Scottish full back is blossoming as one of Steve Bruce’s best bits of talent spotting. The 20-year-old, who cost £2.85million after playing only 36 games for Dundee United, set up one goal and made three more chances with his crossing in the 2-0 win over Crystal Palace. He can defend too – winning 100 per cent of his tackles and condemning Jason Puncheon to an afternoon where he gave the ball away 31 times. Steve Bruce completed an astute piece of business by signing Andrew Robertson for Hull City . 6) Uwe Rosler will be hoping that Wigan owner Dave Whelan is too wrapped up this week following the town’s Rugby League club to Saturday’s Grand Final against St Helens to notice how badly his side are performing. The German, touted as the next big thing when he took the Latics into the play-offs last season, has collected only ten points from the first quarter of the season despite signing 11 new players in the summer. Wigan had taken 14 points from their previous 11 games when Whelan sacked his predecessor Owen Coyle last December . 7) Aussie midfielder Scott McDonald fell out with new boss Ian Holloway last January having tried, and failed, to force through a move to Hibernian. He started only six matches for the rest of the season, and his future looked far from certain until the 31-year-old former Celtic and Middlesbrough star agreed to let bygones be bygones. Millwall boss Ian Holloway has seen Scott McDonald come tio life since making up with the midfielder . Both club and player have reaped rewards from making up. McDonald has not missed a game this term, and was outstanding for the Lions as they battled to a goalless draw away to promotion favourites Derby. 8) Former Manchester United and West Ham goalkeeper Roy Carroll is finding his feet again in English football after four years playing in Denmark and then Greece. The 37-year-old starred in a 1-0 win over Gillingham that lifted his new club Notts County to just a point off the League One play-off places. Former Manchester United keeper Roy Carroll (2L) has been starring for Notts County . Carroll, likely to take his total of Northern Ireland caps to 37 in next week’s two Euro 2016 qualifying games, has now kept four clean sheets in his last seven matches. 9) Even in these days of Academies and Development Squads it is still possible for a late developer to come from the bottom rungs of the football ladder to break through. Step up striker Charlie Walker, who made his League Two debut for Luton in the 2-1 win against local rivals Stevenage. The 24-year-old was discovered playing for Peacehaven, a village club just up the road from Brighton, where he scored 43 goals helping win the Ryman South title and the Sussex Senior Cup. Louis van Gaal allegedly saw that only United's half of the pitch was watered during the Everton game . He was close to a goal on his professional debut, too – with a header that manager John Still claimed had crossed the line but the ref ruled didn’t. 10) Louis van Gaal is not averse to a bit of gamesmanship. The sprinklers at Old Trafford were switched on at half time against Everton – but only to water the half of the pitch that Manchester United would be attacking after the break. That meant the Dutchman’s attacking stars could enjoy a slick surface to ping the ball around going forward, while his defenders would find it easier to keep their feet.","Sergio Aguero is beating compatriot Carlos Tevez's record at Man City .

"Lancashire ran out of time to stave off relegation, and return to Division Two of the LV= County Championship after their Old Trafford shoot-out with Middlesex ended in a stalemate. Only a home victory could have sent Middlesex down instead and - after bad weather took 14 overs out of the last day - the Londoners closed out the draw on 341 for eight declared and with no prospect of a successful chase of 253 in the hour remaining. Veteran Lancashire captain Glen Chapple performed heroics to keep hopes of survival alive when he scrambled the necessary extra batting bonus point here 24 hours earlier. Lancashire captain Glen Chapple looks dejected as Middlesex survived at their expense . Tim Murtagh (centre) is congratulated by a Middlesex team-mate . But neither he nor the best efforts of Junaid Khan (three for 84) and Simon Kerrigan (three for 106) could break Middlesex's resistance as they secured top-flight safety at their hosts' expense. By the time Chapple had to accept the inevitable, glorious evening sunshine had replaced the morning rain which narrowed Lancashire's window of opportunity - yet for the Red Rose, the mood was sombre as they were relegated for the second time in three years. Middlesex had resumed on 202 for four on an initially dank Manchester day, just 114 in front and vulnerable to a surge of wickets for the home attack. They were to lose only four in 60 overs, before Chapple shook hands with his opposite number Chris Rogers midway through the last session. Middlesex can therefore contemplate the closest of shaves at the end of a season they began with a rush of early victories. They ran out of steam alarmingly from June onwards, but rediscovered much-needed resilience to beat the drop with draws here and - from a highly-improbable position - away to Somerset last week. For Lancashire, the step back into the second tier comes in a summer which has seen an overdue title success for their Roses rivals Yorkshire - and means last year's two promoted teams, themselves and Northamptonshire, have both gone immediately back down. In the 10.2 overs possible before the rain arrived, Junaid provided the solitary wicket before lunch - but it was a big one, with a very good delivery. Junaid Khan's (three for 84) wasn't enough to earn victory for Lancashire . Eoin Morgan was Middlesex's chief hope to defuse any home momentum, but was undone by late movement back into him from Lancashire's left-armer to hit his back pad and win an obvious lbw verdict. There was then time for just one more ball, before heavy drizzle swept in and precluded all but 35 minutes of the morning session. A frustrating interruption followed for the Red Rose - who nonetheless returned still on a mission, Junaid ending Neil Dexter's vigil with the score on double-nelson 222. The stoic Dexter had been dropped on nought the previous evening, and by the time he finally played on had held Lancashire up for 111 minutes in all. Another drop, Lancashire's seventh of the match, cost just a single when Bury-born John Simpson mis-pulled Kerrigan to mid-wicket just two balls after being put down by a diving Jos Buttler off the first over of a new Chapple spell. Lancashire's Glen Chapple shakes hands with Middlesex chief Angus Fraser afterwards . The next time the captain brought himself back into the attack, he struck instantly and, it seemed, importantly - nipping one off the seam into Toby Roland-Jones to have him lbw. But if 277 for eight 40 minutes before tea represented plenty of hope still for a feasible chase, it was an illusion which did not last. Instead, tailenders James Harris and Tim Murtagh resisted with minimal alarm in an unbroken stand of 64 - to hugely contrasting emotions on the pitch, but uniform misery among the vast majority of a near 1,000 crowd who had been willing a different conclusion. Lancashire trudge off after their relegation to Division Two was confirmed .","Lancashire down down to Division Two following draw with rivals .

"Andrew Gale has yet to discover what his short-term disciplinary future holds but is already hatching big plans for a new era of Yorkshire success under his captaincy. Gale is likely to hear during the next two days whether, and if so when, he will face an England and Wales Cricket Board hearing over alleged racial content in his on-field spat with Lancashire's Ashwell Prince. He has already paid for his conduct that day at Old Trafford earlier this month, serving a mandatory two-match ban which covered Yorkshire's victory over Nottinghamshire when they clinched the County Championship title at Trent Bridge two weeks ago and their 'coronation' final fixture at home to Somerset. Andrew Gale was prevented from joining Yorkshire's trophy presentation due to the ongoing inquiry . Additionally, and controversially, he was prevented from joining Yorkshire's trophy presentation in Nottingham as it emerged the ECB's inquiry into his altercation with Prince was still ongoing. Gale, and Yorkshire chairman Colin Graves, were not at liberty to discuss that case during a Q&A session with club members in the Headingley long room at lunch against Somerset on Tuesday. The half-hour set-piece was an occasionally chaotic occasion, due to a faulty microphone which interrupted Gale and Graves many times. Both, however, did manage to convey their resolve to be part of a decade of domination of English cricket for Yorkshire. Yorkshire's captain was accused of using racially offensive language towards Lancashire's Ashwell Prince . More than 300 members packed the venue, and were immediately informed no questions could be answered about 'the current situation with Yorkshire and the ECB'. Graves spoke of his pride at having come a 'hell of a long way' with what was a 'club in crisis' when he first began investing in Yorkshire 12 years ago. Graves, also an ECB vice-chairman, made it clear too - irrespective of the outcome of the disciplinary procedure facing the captain - he has long valued Gale as a pillar of Yorkshire's team. Recalling why he first decided to become involved at Headingley, Graves said it was 'for people like Andrew Gale - because to me, that is what Yorkshire cricket is all about ...'. Together, Graves hopes they can help ensure there is no false dawn this time - as there was when Yorkshire last won the title, in 2001. Colin Graves said Yorkshire's county success 'could be the start of an era, for the next 10 years' 'I believe it could be the start of an era, for the next 10 years,' Graves said. 'That's the target I'm setting, for Yorkshire to dominate - county cricket, one-day cricket. 'I think we've got the coaching staff, the players, the academy ... to achieve that.' Gale has the same aspirations. He noticed 'summat special' about Yorkshire even when they first joined up at the start of this season, determined to erase the disappointment of a late fade into runners-up spot the previous summer. As for that long-term future, Gale added: 'This should just be the start of things for Yorkshire cricket. 'We've got to go on now and win trophies year after year.'

"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho believes Eden Hazard's below-par showing against Aston Villa was a one off. Hazard was Chelsea's startling performer last season and is likely to sign a new contract at Stamford Bridge, staving off reported interest from Paris St Germain and Real Madrid. The 23-year-old Belgium playmaker has spoken of his desire to claim the Ballon d'Or and wanted the number 10 shirt at Chelsea, worn by his idol Zinedine Zidane. Eden Hazard was below his best during Chelsea's 3-0 Premier League defeat of Aston Villa . Jose Mourinho has dismissed the Belgian's poor performance as a one off . Suggested Hazard was below his best in Saturday's 3-0 defeat of Villa, Mourinho said: 'Yes. (I) agree. 'I don't know what he needs. I know he needs to play more than he did (against Villa). 'He started the season well. Eden played good matches with us. 'I think it's more an isolated not good performance than a period.

It is likely Mourinho will give Hazard another chance to return to his high-standard showings against Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday in Champions League Group G. Mourinho also hopes to select Diego Costa for a second match in quick succession in Portugal, but it remains to be seen how the prolific striker recovers, given his fragile hamstrings.","Chelsea defeated Aston Villa 3-0 in their Premier League clash .

"A disgruntled Younis Khan is ready to stop playing test cricket until the World Cup after being dropped for Pakistan's one-day international series against Australia. Last month, Younis played one ODI against Sri Lanka in his comeback to limited-overs cricket after 17 months out, then flew back home due to a death in the family. Chief selector Moin Khan said at the squad announcement this week that he was looking to the future in replacing Younis, a veteran of 254 ODIs, with Umar Amin for the three ODIs against Australia next month in the United Arab Emirates. Younis Khan is ready to stop one-day test cricket for Pakistan until the World Cup after being dropped .

"The finest golfer in world watched his ball scuttle across the eighth green, and winced in anguish as the putt died a premature death. There was a muted gasp from the gallery, then a desperate voice cried: ‘It’s all right, Rory! Don’t worry, it’s all right.’ A shadow of a smile crossed McIlroy’s face, his colleague Sergio Garcia tidied up the lapse, and the players moved on. And yet, it was a strangely revealing moment, one which reminded us that this remarkable man is just 25 years old; blessed with prodigious talent, bearing onerous responsibilities, yet still capable of arousing the protective instinct in total strangers. Sergo Garcia (left) and Rory McIlroy (right) embrace in celebration as they secure a point for Europe . Sergio Garcia (left) and Rory McIlroy (right) celebrate during their Ryder Cup foursomes victory . Reunited Europe pairing Rory McIlroy (left) and Sergio Garcia defeated US duo Jim Furyk and Hunter Mahan . It's not over yet - the Ryder Cup can go either way . He moves around the course on a wave of affection, people call his name with the familiarity of old friends. Yet the demands are daunting. After what he has achieved, excellence is the very least we expect. The wonder is that he keeps both his sanity and his good humour; riding the wave as if he still cannot quite believe his luck. If Europe are to win the Ryder Cup on Sunday, then McIlroy’s contribution may prove crucial. Such is the stature of his talent, and such the influence he exerts within his team. He spent Saturday morning’s fourball effectively nursing Ian Poulter towards simple competence. There was no grandstanding, no demonstrations of obvious authority, but the most casual observer would have discerned the senior partner. When Poulter finally flowered, McIlroy slapped his back and shared his joy. It was a genuinely impressive performance. In the afternoon, with Garcia, his nursing duties were similarly in evidence. Again, there was no exhibitionism, no signs of impatience. Garcia was thankful: ‘I think Rory beat three guys today, not just two,’ he said. ‘He was amazing.’ McIlroy beamed his embarrassment. ‘I’m very lucky with my partners,’ he said, and sounded as if he meant it. Tight-knit duo Sergio Garcia (left) and Rory McIlroy support each other as Europe stars walk on the course . CLICK HERE to read the report from Saturday's 2014 Ryder Cup action . The fact that Europe are taking control of this Cup simply reinforced their mood of mutual admiration, but the dominance is clearly based on collective class. And it is McIlroy who sets the standards. Another small cameo spoke volumes. At the ninth, with McIlroy and Garcia clinging to their one-hole lead, Rory contemplated the distant green, selected a long iron, and spanked the ball through several postcodes to the very heart of the green. As the ball left the club, his captain and countryman Paul McGinley gasped: ‘That’s a great shot, Rory! A great shot!’ The words were spoken in awed tones, a full second before the import of the stroke had registered with the galleries. Sergio just shook his head, smiled his delight and bowled along to the distant green, knowing his game was in good hands. That ability to dispatch the ball a country mile is perhaps the most spectacular trait of McIlroy’s game. Those who truly understand the mechanics of the golf swing could doubtless explain how a man standing 5ft 9in tall and weighing 11st 5lb can generate such stunning power. The rest of us can only watch and wonder. And the crowds just revere him, partly through his genius, partly because of the affability of his bearing. People talk to him, joke with him, as they would a favourite brother. Team Europe's Sergio Garcia of Spain and Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland line up a putt on Saturday . Sergio Garcia and Rory McIlroy of Europe congratulate each other during their afternoon session . Rory McIlroy and Sergio Aguero's awesome foursome scorecard shows their perfect partnership . At the sixth tee on Saturday afternoon, he dived into the tee-side toilet while waiting for the crowd to clear the green. When he emerged, a solicitous matron inquired: ‘Better now?’ He gave her a nod. ‘Much better, thanks,’ he responded, and carried on with the Ryder Cup. It was scarcely Wildean wit, but others would have ignored the woman. That is obviously not his way. The people responsible for raising and rearing the impressive young man were following his every shot on Saturday. His father, Gerry, faded into the small squad of people who follow the players inside the ropes. Clutching a white woolly hat, he looked on anonymously as his son went to work. His mother, Rosie, kept a similarly low profile as she huddled on the caddy cart chugging behind the pack. There was no show, no seeking cheap attention. That is not the way of folk in their little corner of County Down. But their pride in the boy was unmistakable. He was a credit to them, a credit to Moneyreagh. Only once did he come close to anger, and that on the seventh fairway, when the match referee belatedly ruled that it was the Americans turn to play while McIlroy was standing over his ball. Team Europe star Rory McIlroy looks relaxed after a fine day at Gleneagles on Saturday against USA . ‘But I’m ready!’ he protested. ‘Can’t you see I’m ready?’ He thrust his iron back into his bag, and then, after a second’s reflection, he giggled like a small boy, and got on with the game. Everyone chuckled, conspiring in the moment. On Saturday, he could do no wrong. So on he went, intimidating tremendous players like Jim Furyk and Hunter Mahan by the sheer force of his ability. And he brought his partner, Garcia, home by a handsome 3&2. More heroics will be required from him on Sunday, of course. More minor miracles, more shots which are beyond the scope or imagination of ordinary golfers. But there is no sign as yet that the pressure is weighing heavily upon him. Indeed, he actually seems to revel in the impudent expectations. It has something to do with his youth, much to do with his talent, and just about everything to do with his personality. For at the moment, and along with the dazzlingly excellent Justin Rose, Rory McIlroy seems to own Gleneagles. He is a credit to his sport, a credit to Europe, most importantly, he is a credit to Moneyreagh, County Down. You suspect he would settle for that.

"Ian Poulter was nicknamed ‘The Postman’ by his Europe team-mates at the 2010 Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor. The singles were about to begin when he made a vow: ‘I will deliver my point.’ He duly did. Europe won. Poulter delivered three points from four matches then and four from five at Valhalla two years earlier. He always delivers. His first-ever Ryder Cup point, at Oakland Hills in 2004, technically won the trophy that year. His four points from four matches during the Miracle in Medinah two years ago were more momentous still. Ian Poulter celebrates his brilliant 50-yard chip-in that rescued half a point at Gleneagles on Saturday . Poulter showed his passion and despite being out of form he is again proving invaluable to Europe . Poulter's team-mates view him as a talisman to their hopes and he has helped them to their lead . So to arrive here at Gleneagles, out of form and down on inspiration, in Paul McGinley’s team only as a captain’s pick and not a certain starter, has brought a new pressure on the 38-year-old. And he looked under every ounce of it on Friday as he and rookie Stephen Gallacher were drubbed 5&4 by the Texan rookies Jordan Speith and Patrick Reed in the morning fourballs. But yesterday, at 12.29pm, Poulter took a parcel of magic and dropped it on this biggest of stages. The USA fourball pair of Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker were one up on Poulter and his partner Rory McIlroy. Fowler had hit a peach of an approach to the 15th to guarantee himself a birdie and a likely two-hole lead in the match with three holes to play. Poulter’s first shot had hit the rough and his second sat 50 yards from the pin, next to a bunker. He addressed the ball, glanced up, took a short backswing and chipped. The ball carried, and bounced ... and dropped. The sound that came from Poulter’s mouth was something between ‘YES!’ and ‘ARRRGHH’, only longer, much longer. He didn’t so much pump both fists as his entire upper body, more than once, in a visceral release. Poulter and McIlory can't quite bring themselves to watch during the Foursballs . Rory McIlroy congratulates Poulter on his utterly brilliant chip-in - even the World No 1 was impressed! The crowd responded, tumultuously, and then, most importantly of all, Poulter carried the momentum, sank a brilliant putt at the next to level the match and contributed significantly as he and McIlroy held on for a half. ‘There was a lot of emotion, it’s been waiting to come out,’ Poulter said. ‘It took way too long for it to do so but it was nice to be able to do it in that fashion. ‘Obviously I haven’t played my best golf [here]. You just have to get something going. You have to stay positive. You have to keep telling yourself that good stuff’s coming. I’ve got a big heart and I love this Ryder Cup.’ It was put to Poulter that he had been playing ‘like a drain’ up until that point. He took the observation on the chin, although he rightly pointed out he made two early birdies yesterday before ‘I kind of fell asleep in the middle [of the match]. Then it was nice to get the juices flowing. Not much has gone in the hole yet so far this week.’ Poulter is the centre of attention of the Gleneagles crowd as he plays a shot out of the rough on the 18th . He then pointed out he has featured just twice here, something that might have been construed as mild displeasure. Not so, it appears. He said it was more important for him to contribute to the score ‘from a team perspective’. On the issue of being omitted yesterday afternoon just as he had hit form, he added: ‘Yeah, but there’s also lots of other guys that want to play. Only eight can get out on the golf course, we have 12 great players. There are no egos in this team, you have to respect the captain’s decision.’ He had already made light of his nickname and the inevitability it would be mentioned. ‘Funny things happen, don’t they?’ he said. He joked that perhaps his moniker should now change to ‘Late Delivery’ or ‘Second Class Post’. Poulter reacts to a putt as spectators look on in the beautiful surroundings at Gleneagles . It was a decent day for Poulter - and he watches on at his tee shot off the 7th here . Poulter was then asked whether he would be making any vow to his captain, Paul McGinley, about delivery a point in the singles. ‘I’m not telling you,’ he smiled. His team-mate Henrik Stenson interjected at that stage to add: ‘That means he can guarantee a half. Or better.’ By close of play, Poulter will certainly have finished his round. All eyes are on Poulter as he hits a chip - he will be hoping to deliver again for Europe on Sunday .","Ian Poulter picked up his nickname at the 2010 Ryder Cup .

"Former Leeds United managing director David Haigh has filed a ‘deceit’ claim in the High Court against five parties including Gulf Finance House, the Bahraini bank that still controls 25 per cent of the Championship club’s shares. The claim surrounds the circumstances in which Haigh was invited to Dubai in May on the apparent prospect of a new job, only to be arrested and accused by GFH of large-scale fraud and embezzlement. Haigh has since spent 140 days in a Dubai police station without being charged. David Haigh has filed a 'deceit' claim in the High court against five parties, including Gulf Finance House . Haigh’s claim is against GFH as well as GFH’s Dubai subsidiary, GFH Capital, plus three individuals who work for those companies, and is detailed in papers lodged at the High Court on Friday, seen by Sportsmail. Immediate repercussions for Leeds as a football club are likely to range from small to none at all. The longer-term implications are less easy to predict as a current co-owning party (GFH) and a former MD (Haigh) ramp up an increasingly acrimonious legal and PR war that threatens to be costly and damaging to one or both of them. GFHC have successfully had all Haigh’s assets frozen globally as they pursue claims against him for almost £4million, money they allege Haigh stole using falsified invoices. The former managing director of Leeds United, Haigh, with the club's former owner, Ken Bates . Haigh said via a spokesman today: ‘I have been wrongly and unscrupulously held in jail for almost five months on false pretences. This is wrong and an abuse of my human rights. ‘After many months of being frustrated in my attempts to defend myself, my legal team will shortly be ready to file a full defence and my own claims against GFHC – which will be considerably larger than those they have laid against me.’ GFH Capital responded by saying they have not been served with any claim by Haigh. This claim appears to be true in as much as no physical documents have been delivered, yet, to either Dubai or Bahrain. A legal process has undoubtedly been started, however, as the claim document has been stamped at the High Court. Haigh (right) has enlisted the services of forensic investigators in a bid to clear his name . GFH say: ‘Contrary to the statement that has been issued by David Haigh today, no claim by David Haigh has yet been served on GFH Capital or any other party. ‘Until a particularised claim has been received it is therefore impossible to give any comment on any such claim. It is clear that this statement is in reality just another blatant attempt by Mr Haigh to attract attention in circumstances where GFH Capital maintains its claims of fraud against Mr Haigh in the [Dubai] Court.’ Asked to clarify whether GFH are aware of the claim papers issued in the High Court, a spokesman added: ‘Yes, but they have not been served and there are no particulars.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Former Leeds United managing director David Haigh filed 'deceit' claims .

"Lionel Messi went through the 400 goal barrier and Neymar scored his first ever league hat-trick for Barcelona as Luis Enrique's team beat Granada 6-0 to stay top of La Liga. The Argentine is now on 401 career goals for club and country in 524 matches, aged only 27. Aside from Neymar's treble and Messi's magic there was plenty more to please coach Luis Enrique ahead of Barcelona's trip to Paris to play PSG on Tuesday. CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL MATCH REPORT FROM BARCELONA V GRANADA . Host commentator . Barcelona have leapfrogged Valencia to go to the top of La Liga after an impressive 6-0 win against Granada. Neymar stole the show by scoring his second hat-trick for Barcelona while Lionel Messi, who scored his 400th senior goal, bagged a brace. Ivan Rakitic, who looked extremely impressive for the home side, also managed to get himself on the scoresheet. Barcelona go three points clear at the top of La Liga with an emphatic win against Granada. Neymar stole the show by grabbing a hat-trick, while Lionel Messi (x2) and Ivan Rakitic also got themselves on the scoresheet. Claudio Bravo is yet to concede a goal for Barcelona since joining the club from Sociedad in the summer. Predictions on how long that will last? Neymar and Lionel Messi are simply unstoppable when they are in this kind of form. 86 minutes gone and they are still running riot at the Nou Camp. Neymar is congratulated by Messi after the Brazilian grabs a hat-trick . Lionel Messi scores his fifth league goal to put his side 6-0 up in the 81st minute. He steals the ball from Babin before lifting the ball over the onrushing Granada goalkeeper. Neymar will be delighted with his start to the season. Six league goals in five La Liga games is not a bad way to start the campaign. Barcelona seem to have taken their foot off the pedal slightly now. They will surely have one eye on their upcoming Champions League encounter against PSG. Neymar grabs his hat-trick by slotting past Roberto. That is the Brazilian's second hat-trick since joining the club from Santos. Lionel Messi makes it 4-0 after a fantastic move. Xavi plays a long ball to Dani Alves who hits it first time to Messi who has the easy task of nodding home from close range. Easy stuff for the home side. Luis Enrique has chosen to withdraw Rakitic in order for the midfielder to get some rest before Barcelona's clash against PSG in midweek. Ivan Rakitic receives a standing ovation by the Nou Camp faithful with Sergi Roberto replacing the Croatian international. Xavi came close to making it 4-0 with a curling free-kick from 25 yards. Roberto would have been expecting a shot from Messi but the Barcelona veteran surprised everyone by taking the set-piece. In fact the pair have linked up once again to win a free-kick on the edge of the area... The likes of Messi and Neymar will enjoy playing ahead of Rakitic during the course of the season. He can score goals as well as set them up for his Barcelona team-mates. Dani Alves goes on marauding run down the right before playing it to his fellow countryman Neymar. The forward's subsequent shot is blocked leaving the scoreline at 3-0. Piti and Pascual Eddy are the two players to come on for Granada with Fran Rico and Hector Yuste making way for the duo. Granada have made a couple of changes to try and get themselves back in the game. Let's see if they can pull at least one goal back... You can see why a host of sides were interested in signing Rakitic during the summer judging by today's performance. Here's his goal which put Barcelona 2-0 up. Will Neymar be able to score a third to grab a hat-trick? Stay tuned to our live commentary to see what happens in the second half... Barcelona will have no pressure in the second half with the three points well and truly in their hands. The scoreline could be anything if Messi and Co. continue to shine. The home side have surely put the game to bed by scoring two goals in quick succession so late on in the first half. El Arabi and the brilliantly named Isaac Success causing problems against Barça's defence but then a little Messi magic brings the second goal - Messi's 7th league assist of the season. Messi is involved again as the Argentine sets up Munir who is brought down by Granada's goalkeeper. Neymar then sweeps up to put his side 3-0 up at half-time. We told you about Rakitic. The summer signing gets onto a cross by Lionel Messi to nod home from close range. Down the other end at Granada have a rare opportunity. El Arabi links up with team-mate Success but the latter fails to work Bravo. Rakitic, playing on the right of Barcelona's midfield three, has been allowed the time and space to dictate play. Could prove to be a bad move by Granada... Granada are camped in their own half as Barcelona are dictating play in midfield. Can they grab another before half-time though? Neymar wheels away in celebration with Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi. The 22-year-old's grabbed his fourth goal of the season against Granada. How many more will he score tonight? With Xavi, Rakitic and Busquets in midfield Barça don't need any help with the killer pass. Granada's Yuste played Neymar in perfectly there for Barca's first goal . The Barcelona forward gets a lucky deflection off Granada defender Babin which ends up in the ball looping over the head of the helpess Roberto. Neymar puts his side in the lead. Xavi sends a powerful shot towards Roberto's goal but his effort goes straight into the goalkeeper's hands. El Arabi fashions a chance for himself by running at Barcelona's defence but fails to work Braavo. Neymar then races up the other end but his cross is deflected away for a corner. Ivan Rakitic has shown some nice early touches for Barcelona. Looks to have settled into life at the Catalan giants with minimum ease. Seems to be quite a slow pace at the Nou Camp. Messi tries to inject some life into the game but cannot get a shot off on at goal. Barcelona go close as Granada's El Arabi slips inside the area however the home team fail to capitalise on his early mistake. Still 0-0. The first five matches have flown by without any real chances of note. Barcelona look lively in possession but are yet to break down Granada's defence. Granada are wearing their blue strip while Barcelona are in their traditional blue and red strip. Granada gets the game under way by kicking off at the Nou Camp . Barcelona's La Liga rivals won 2-0 earlier in the day which will surely put pressure on Luis Enrique's side - even at this early stage. Luka Modric and Cristiano Ronaldo netted for Real Madrid against Malaga . Messi and Co will wear a slightly different shirt in honour of the club's museum. Lionel Messi, of course, starts for Barcelona in a three-pronged attack with Munir and Neymar. The Argentine has scored three league goals for the Catalan giants so far this season. Barcelona XI: Bravo, Alves, Mathieu, Mascherano, Adriano, Xavi, Busquets, Rakitic, Munir, Messi, Neymar . Granada XI: Roberto, Nyom, Ba bin, Murillo, Foulquier, Iturra, Yuste, Fran Rico, Javi Marquez, Success, El Arabi. Barcelona will be hoping to get back to winning ways after only managing to claim a point against Malaga on Wednesday. Can the likes of Messi and Neymar inspire their side to victory at the Nou Camp?","Neymar stole the show by scoring three goals against Granada .

Blind said: 'He has helped me a lot. He told where to put my shoes and all those little things you need to know when you’re new.' He added: 'I imagine it can be difficult if you do not have someone to help you at a new club.' With three wins out of the last four games, United's progress has been obvious yet not always simple. The disappointment of the 5-3 defeat at Leicester has been followed by two home wins over West Ham and Everton. Blind teamed up with Van Persie to add to the Dutch connection at Old Trafford alongside boss Louis van Gaal. Guus Hiddink (right) looks on alongside his Holland players in training in Noordwijk .

'I think the players are getting used to [Van Gaal’s methods]. The players like to work with him. Everyone is picking it up very well,' he added. 'Training is very hard and very serious and we improve every day and you could see that in the first half [of the 2-1 win] against Everton.'

"Louis van Gaal refused to be drawn into a debate over whether Wayne Rooney has the right temperament to captain Manchester United after the England striker was sent off for a wild challenge at Old Trafford. Click here for Matt Lawton's match report from Old Trafford. Rooney received the sixth red card of his career for lashing out at Stewart Downing with a lunge that was almost waist-height and left his United colleagues to defend for a 2-1 win over West Ham with 10 men for more than half an hour. But Van Gaal not only dismissed any suggestion he might have made a mistake making Rooney captain but argued, quite bizarrely, that he was guilty of nothing more than a professional foul. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney lashed out at West Ham's Stewart Downing and was sent off . United won the game 2-1 on Saturday but questions have been asked about Rooney's temperament . Rooney is shown the red card by referee Lee Mason in the 59th minute as Downing (left) lies on the floor . A dejected Rooney left the Old Trafford pitch with his head bowed, but his team-mates hung on for the win . Dutch Manager Louis van Gaal would not be drawn on whether the striker was a good choice as captain . The former Bayern Munich boss will have to make do without his skipper for the next three matches . Sun Oct 5 vs Everton . Mon Oct 20 vs West Brom . Sun Oct 26 vs Chelsea . A straight red for violent conduct will result in a three-match ban for Rooney, meaning he will miss the clash with Chelsea on October 26. Asked why he saw it as a professional foul when Downing was deep in West Ham’s half, and if he shouldn’t have made Rooney captain, the Dutchman snapped: ‘For me, that is neither a good analysis by you and neither a good question.’ Asked then if he intended to answer the question, he said: ‘It is my right not to [answer].’ United and England captain  Rooney walks off the pitch after receiving a red card for a kick at Downing . The afternoon had started so well for Rooney when he swept United into the lead in  the fifth minute . Robin van Persie doubled United's advantage when he fired home right-footed in the 23rd minute . West Ham rallied and striker Diafra Sakho (centre) pulled a goal back with a close-range header . The Hammers thought they'd equalised through Kevin Nolan, but the midfielder's goal was ruled out for offside . Phil Neville: ‘It’s a reckless tackle. There’s no reason even to make the foul because of the position the defenders are in.’ Ruud Gullit: ‘He could have just tripped him but he just lashes out. Sometimes he gets these moments in his career – like when he missed the first games with the national team (at Euro 2012).’ Rooney had opened the scoring with the 175th league goal of his career, moving him ahead of Thierry Henry into third place in Premier League scoring behind Alan Shearer and Andy Cole. Van Gaal added: '(It was) the right card for Wayne. I could imagine why he did it. 'But I think you have to do it more friendly and that is the only thing that I can say. I call that a professional foul. 'Maybe you don't want to hear it but in professional football you make professional fouls.' Opposite number Sam Allardyce gave a more balanced view. ‘It looks cynical,’ said Allardyce. ‘Whether it’s a red card or not according to the rules, he just stopped him.’ September 2005: Sent off for sarcastically aplauding referee against Villarreal . July 2006: Sent off for stamp on Ricardo Carvalho at Euro 2006 . August 2006: Dismissed in Amsterdam Tournament for hitting Porto defender Pepe with his elbow .

"Queens Park Rangers have confirmed that former player Les Ferdinand has been named the club's new head of football operations. The move has been mooted for a while and with Richard Allen moving on to take up a role with the Football Association, Ferdinand has filled the void. The 47-year-old was seen deep in discussion with chairman Tony Fernandes and chief executive Phil Beard on Sunday as QPR crashed to defeat at West Ham, as a result leaving them rock bottom of the Premier League, fuelling speculation the former R's forward was set for a return to W12. Les Ferdinand is all smiles as he is announced as QPR's new Head of Football Operations . Ferdinand says it is incredible to be back at a club which holds a special place in his heart . Ferdinand established himself as one of the best strikers around during his time with Queens Park Rangers . Ferdinand, who spent eight years of his playing career at Loftus Road, worked under Tim Sherwood at Spurs last season but left the club after Mauricio Pochettino's appointment this summer. Fernandes had previously said there was no position for the former R's striker in a Director of Football role, but was always keen to take on the former prolific hitman if a role came up elsewhere. The Rangers chairman said recently on the former R's striker: 'My focus is trying to develop the academy — Les is one of the many names we're looking at. I'd love to see him come back to QPR but we'll have to wait and see.' R's boss Harry Redknapp was particularly keen to get Ferdinand on board, knowing the qualities he can bring to the table after working with him during his time as Spurs boss. QPR owner Tony Fernandes was very keen to bring back the club's former striker . Ferdinand spent last season working as a coach under Tim Sherwood at another of his clubs, Tottenham . The 67-year-old told the club's official website: 'I'm pleased to welcome Les back to the club. 'There's no doubting the qualities he'll bring to the role, having enjoyed a great time here as a player.' Ferdinand expressed his delight on the news saying: 'It's incredible to be back here. This club holds a special place in my heart. Everyone knows what it means to me, so when the opportunity to return here in this role came up I jumped at the opportunity. 'There's nothing I want more than for QPR to be successful in the short, medium and long term and I'm excited about the challenge ahead.' Meanwhile, chairman Fernandes added: 'Football has changed considerably in recent years and I firmly believe there is a role at every football club for this kind of position. Les is a fantastic QPR man and I know the fans will join me in welcoming him back to a place he has a great fondness for.'","Les Ferdinand has been confirmed as QPR's new head of football operations .

"Sepp Blatter is urging England to bid for the next World Cup in Europe, standing firm on Russia and Qatar as hosts for 2018 and 2022 and promising to speed up the introduction of more new technology. The FIFA president approaches another four-year term in office promising to step up the fight against racism, with the imposition of punitive points deductions and expulsion from cup competitions. He will use the awarding of a women’s tournament to Jordan as football’s instrument in the campaign for female equality in the Arab world. He reports, also, on how FIFA is working as a force for reconciliation between Israel and Palestine. VIDEO Sepp Blatter discussing Qatar and Russia with Jeff Powell ahead of Soccerex . Outspoken: FIFA president Sepp Blatter (left) has given an exclusive interview to Sportsmail's Jeff Powell (right) Head of the global game: Blatter spoke on a number of crucial issues surrounding world football . All this, and more, emerges from Blatter’s first major interview since Brazil 2014. This exclusive discussion was conducted by me at FIFA headquarters in Zurich for premier screening to thousands of delegates at the opening of the SoccerEx Global Football Convention in Manchester on Monday morning. Blatter expresses his profound delight at the success of Brazil 2014, as well as his gratitude to the Brazilian people for justifying his optimism that their love of the Beautiful Game would not let their socio-economic protests spoil ‘this great World Cup.’ He also reveals the multi-billion-dollar scale of FIFA’s income during this four-year World Cup cycle and its distribution of a high proportion of that wealth to aid the development of football around the world. All-round success: Blatter was delighted with Brazil for a great World Cup, which was won by Germany . Coming home: Before a World Cup can be held in England it will likely visit Africa, as it did in 2010 . Final venue? Wembley could host just its second World Cup final - after 1966 - if Blatter is to be believed . Michel Platini, it emerges, advised FIFA’s president in advance of his decision not to stand against his re-election next year, but to remain at the head of UEFA. Thus Blatter predicts growing unity between the two bodies, totally discounting any possibility of star players with major European clubs ever boycotting the World Cup, ‘the high-point of their careers.’ That said, he went on to announce that he will formally confirm his candidacy for four more years in the next few weeks. That may be the worst-kept secret in sport. But making it official for the first time enabled him to address the corruption accusations that have been dogging the governing body of the world game. Brothers in arms: Blatter sees Michel Platini's UEFA growing closer to FIFA in the coming years . Friends? It now looks like Platini will not rival Blatter for the FIFA crown as he goes for re-election . In so doing Blatter offers a rare, personal insight into himself as a football-loving man, as he admits how deeply hurt he was by allegations in an English newspaper which attempted to connect him to any wrong-doing. His reminder to the world that he has been totally exonerated is passionately delivered, as is his assurance that the independent investigation being led by New York lawyer Michael Garcia will be completely transparent and honest. He asks only that all such deliberations and any critical discussions are conducted with mutual respect, not the heated discourtesy which he sees as having reflecting poorly on the game. Experience: Wembley has hosted a Champions League final, an Olympic final and is in line for the big one . European choice: An English-held World Cup is possible in 2030 - but it might host Euro 2020's final too . On the English question, raised after Greg Dyke’s outburst against him at a FIFA convention in Brazil, Blatter makes it clear that he ‘likes’ the new FA chairman, holds no grudge and is sure he will be ‘respectful’ next time they meet. He also urges Dyke to step back from vowing that England will never again bid for the World Cup while he is FIFA president. That statement was born of England’s angst at their high-profile bid team securing only one vote in the ballot for 2018 but Blatter says: ‘You have to be prepared to accept losing – and of course be ready to bid again.’ However, the earliest England could host the Finals is 2030. Beauty: Blatter is determined to bring a World Cup to the Middle East and says Qatar 2022 will go ahead . Stunning vision: The stadiums in Qatar have been unveiled and all feature futuristic designs . Blatter expects that under the rotation system, Qatar will almost certainly be followed in 2026 by either an African contender, a joint staging by Uruguay and Argentina, or the USA following the huge TV audiences recorded in Ameriica for Brazil 2014. Of the Qatar controversy, he explains ‘the need to take the World Cup to the Middle East for the first time’ and adds that FIFA are ‘totally committed’ to that decision. He confirms that the tournament will be moved to the cool of winter, although the precise timing will not be resolved until after discussions this week about re-scheduling the European club season that winter. Still coming: No world stars, including the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, will boycott a World Cup, says Blatter . Of the Russia controversy, Blatter says that while FIFA will ‘continue to monitor’ the situation in Ukraine ‘we are already working with Russia to prepare for that World Cup.’ He also reasserts FIFA’s principle of resisting the interference of politics in football. Of the call by some EU ambassadors for a boycott, he says: ‘They never do any good.’ On the issue of racist abuse – be it evident in players, team officials or fans - he is urging the application of regulations already in place for points to be deducted or offending clubs to be thrown out of even the most important cups. While he admits that identifying offenders in crowds that can be infiltrated by rival fans, he anticipates extra security scrutiny and adds that ‘sometimes you have to take a chance’ to make progress. Changes: Jose Mourinho and other manages could be handed the chance to appeal against referees' decisions . Blatter sees no risk in the next hi-tech step which will follow the success of goal-line technology. He is bringing forward trials for managers and coaches to be given two challenges in each half of a game against decisions. Referees will be engaged in the review process, going to the touchline as soon as play is stopped to study the video replays. That innovation will be in place before the next World Cup. Of the one just ended, he had ‘no doubts’ that Brazil’s stadia and infrastructure would be ready in time. He thanks all in that country for staying behind the Finals after their team were knocked out. He suspects, also, that the very decisive nature of Germany’s seven-goal victory helped the Brazilians accept that exit without complaint and continue enjoying a magnificent tournament. Success: Blatter says he had 'no doubts' that Brazil would be ready in time for the World Cup last summer . That helped boost FIFA’s income from the World Cup cycle to £2.7billion ‘of which more than 70 per cent’ will be dispersed to Brazil and the nations in the Finals, or distributed among confederations and associations for the good of the game in all corners of the football world. And all that is but a taste of a fascinating conversation. The interview was filmed in one, unbroken take with no pauses for thought and no questions ducked.","FA chairman Greg Dyke has said England will not bid for a World Cup .

"Yohan Cabaye has left Newcastle’s base in Norfolk to complete his £23million move to Paris St Germain. The France international has said his final farewells to his Newcastle team-mates, including close friend Mathieu Debuchy, after the French club offered a deal, with add-ons, which is closer to owner Mike Ashley’s valuation. Cabaye is expected in the French capital at lunchtime for a medical and to agree and finalise personal terms. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alan Pardew discuss Cabaye's importance to Newcastle . Worry: Alan Pardew admits he is not confident of keeping Yohan Cabaye at Newcastle . On form: Cabaye has been outstanding for Newcastle in recent weeks . The former Lille player, who joined . Newcastle for just £4.5million, pushed through the move which comes five . months after he went on strike when Arsenal’s bid was turned down. He . told manager Alan Pardew after training yesterday that he was keen to . move back to France. His . departure is a blow to Pardew, whose side face Norwich City and former . manager Chris Hughton tonight, before they take on Sunderland in the . Tyne-Wear derby on Saturday lunchtime. Pardew . and chief scout Graham Carr now have until Friday to find a replacement . for Cabaye, who has been their outstanding player this season after . returning to the side following the closure of the August transfer . window. They are also hoping to complete a deal to bring in Holland . striker Luuk de Jong. Joe Kinnear . Yohan Cabaye's imminent move to Paris Saint Germain for a fee of £23million is at odds with a statement made by Newcastle's director of football Joe Kinnear on January 20th. Kinnear insisted that the France international would not be leaving St James's Park after earlier interest from Arsenal and the big spending Ligue 1 club. 'I will not let any player leave Newcastle United in this transfer window,' said Kinnear only eight days ago. By Richard Arrowsmith . Montpellier’s . midfielder Remy Cabella remains the favourite to join Newcastle and, . despite the opposition of their owner Louis Nicollin, could now be . convinced to move to the North East. The . loss of Cabaye will also be felt by Newcastle supporters who had . recognised the influence of the France international in a new role in . the side. His decision to . go on strike on the eve of the new season was misguided to say the . least, but he recovered his relationship with supporters who regularly . sang his name with the best form of his Newcastle career. Rumours . of PSG’s interest may have surfaced before their game at West Ham a . fortnight ago, but Cabaye scored two at Upton Park in arguably one of . his best performances of the season. New team-mates? Cabaye could be providing the ammunition for Edinson Cavani (left) and Zlatan Ibrahimovic . Ashley’s . decision to sell one of his favourite players comes down to business . and nearly £20million profit for a 28-year-old is too good to turn down. But it is derby week. The timing could be better. Unlike the sale of Andy Carroll, which led to the signing of Shefki Kuqi, Newcastle have time to find a replacement.

"Children should be banned from using mobile phones and iPads during at the dinner table, Nick Clegg said today. Despite many parents relying on modern technology to keep youngsters quiet, the Deputy Prime Minister said meal times should be gadget-free. And he lashed out at the ‘curse’ of colleagues in government who sit glued to iPhones and Blackberries during meetings ‘mumbling’. Curse: Nick Clegg complained that modern technology was ruining meal times and meetings . The nation has been divided over . mobile phone etiquette after 26-year-old Jo Clarke was told she would . not be served in a Sainsbury’s branch in London until she ended her . call. Mr Clegg said he had a ‘sneaking sympathy’ for the checkout worker in Crayford, south east London. He said it drove him ‘round the bend’ when people constantly had their ‘noses glued’ to smartphones and iPads. The Lib Dem leader said he ‘strongly suspects’ he has spoken on a mobile while standing in a queue in a shop. Complaint: The Deputy Prime Minister does not like people who keep checking their phones, as he was pictured doing near his home in May 2010 . But he added: ‘If the customer was not responding, then the check-out woman couldn't do her job and she's perfectly entitled to ask “Well, do you want it or not?”. ‘I have a sneaking sympathy for her. But I understand Sainsbury's have to be on the side of their customers.’ He went on to reveal the strict mobile rule around the Clegg dinner table, despite grumbling from his three sons. Speaking on his LBC 97.3 radio phone-in, he said: ‘It’s not actually formally banned but we don’t ever use them. ‘Miriam . and I have quite a … I wouldn’t say it was rigid it sounds far too . Victorian.  But we kind of really value sitting with all of us, our . three boys, together. ‘The oldest is already constantly saying “oh god, I don’t want to be here”. ‘But no, I actually really do think you know the old saying, families that eat together stay together. ‘I think it’s incredibly important to spend time.  Don’t have your iPads and your mobile phones.’ Talking point: Shopper Jo Clarke, 26, received an apology from Sainsbury's after being told to hang up the phone before she used the check out at a store in Crayford, London . David Cameron has previously boasted of being addicted to his iPad, including playing games such as Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja. It was not clear if Mr Clegg was referring to the Prime Minister when he ranted about people not paying attention in meetings. ‘I have sat in numerable meetings where people don’t look each other in the eye,’ Mr Clegg said. ‘ They don’t appear to be paying attention.  They sort of half dip in and dip out of conversations.  They spend their whole time with their nose glued to their hand held appliance. ‘It drives me round the bend. Having said that, I’m sure I, from time to time pick up my Blackberry. ‘But I just think we have this real tendency where people are supposed to talk to each other, they don’t actually talk to each other, they mumble at each other whilst actually communicating with their own hand held appliances.’","Deputy PM backs checkout worker refusing to serve customer on phone .

"Norwich City were left to rue a succession of missed chances once again as Rotherham United collected a point at Carrow Road. The Canaries had done everything but score in the midweek defeat here to Charlton Athletic and they were left kicking themselves again after a match in which they could easily have racked up four or five. At least the sense of deja-vu didn’t include another defeat, with Cameron Jerome sliding in an equaliser with 13 minutes left to spare them after Kyle Lafferty’s clever low free-kick had ricocheted off the base of the post. Paul Green celebrates giving Rotherham the lead at a wet Carrow Road . The Irish midfielder sens John Ruddy the wrong way from the spot to give Rotherham the lead . Cameron Jerome looks dejected after missing a chance - but he would eventually get his goal to equalise . But that was the only one of Norwich’s 27 chances to count and Neil Adams will be concerned that his strikers are so profligate as they bid to bounce back immediately to the Premier League. He will also be irked by John Ruddy’s rush of blood to the head late in the first half when the goalkeeper recklessly brought down Matt Derbyshire and Paul Green calmly stroked home a penalty to give Rotherham the lead against the grain of the game. With Watford held at home by Brighton, the Canaries remain on their Championship perch but Nottingham Forest will return top if they beat Ipswich Town on Sunday. Adams made two changes from the team beaten late on by Charlton in midweek, restoring Jonny Howson for his first league start of the season in place of Alexander Tettey and brining in Jos Hooiveld for Steven Whittaker. Steve Evans brought in Derbyshire, Craig Morgan and Richard Brindley to the side that ended a five-match winless run against Blackburn Rovers on Tuesday. And the Millers carved the first opportunity of the afternoon when Ben Pringle’s deep free-kick was knocked down at the back post by Morgan only for Derbyshire to get his feet in a muddle with the goal gaping and allow Ruddy to scramble clear.

Subs not used: Loach (GK); Hall, Taylor, Wordsworth, Rowe . Scorer: Green (42 pen) Booked: Richardson . Referee: Phil Gibbs 6.5 . Attendance: 26,114 . Man of the match: Adam Collin . In torrential Norfolk rain, table-topping Norwich quickly found their rhythm. Nippy Nathan Redmond looked dangerous every time he touched the ball and his square pass led to Bradley Johnson blazing over from a very good position. Cameron Jerome, seeking to add to his six goals so far this season, was a constant torment to the Rotherham defence and he drove a shot wide from the edge of the area after Wes Hoolahan showed good awareness to tee him up. Powerful frontman Jerome dominated in the air and twice headed wide, firstly from Martin Olsson’s left-wing cross and later from Redmond’s pinpoint free-kick from the right. The match had started to lose its fizz but an extraordinary 42nd minute ignited things once again. Rotherham keeper Adam Collin pulled off an incredible double save, initially to deny Lewis Grabban’s header from a Redmond free-kick, then to block Jerome’s point-blank follow-up. Jerome also saw a shot blocked off the line by Kari Arnason during the same goalmouth scramble. The Millers, lucky not to be behind, then broke with pace and precision, a dangerous long ball over the top prompting Ruddy to clatter Derbyshire and Green made Norwich pay from 12 yards. Norwich, who enjoyed 65 per cent of possession, started the second half with intent and Grabban fired a ball across the goalmouth that was just begging for a touch. Nobody obliged. But sometimes Norwich’s sloppiness in passing proved their downfall. Alex Revell pounced on a slack Hoolahan pass and played in Derbyshire, who drove his shot wide of the far post. Those in the crowd in yellow and green groaned their disapproval. Just after the hour, Redmond’s free-kick caused carnage as it fizzed across the box, with Rotherham somehow managing to hack it to safety, . Martin Olsson takes a shot at goal despite the close attentions of Rotherham defender Craig Morgan . Craig Morgan gets to the ball ahead of Norwich striker Cameron Jerome, who scored his side's only goal . Two minutes later, substitute Kyle Lafferty’s shot deflected off Jerome and wrong-footed Collin, only to strike the base of the post. Norwich’s pressure had become as incessant as the drizzle and Johnson drew a smart save from Collin, who also had to push away Olsson’s wicked curling cross from underneath his crossbar. Despite Norwich’s dominance, Rotherham still posed an occasional threat on the counter-attack, with Howson clearing off the line from Morgan’s header from Green’s cross. There really could be no complaints when Jerome found himself in the right place at the right time to knock in Norwich’s equaliser 13 minutes from time. It was the 27-year-old’s seventh in eight matches this season but any celebrations were cut short when his knee collided with the post in the act of scoring. The pain was worth it for the point gained, though Norwich were left feeling they should have taken more and indeed they could have done when Morgan sliced over his own goal deep into stoppage time.","Paul Green gives Rotherham the lead from the penalty spot after John Ruddy brought down Matt Derbyshire .

"The achievements of famous Manchester United Class of 92 have been well documented – but for every success story there is a hard luck story not far away. And while the likes of Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and the Neville brothers went onto to have great careers at United – Birmingham-born midfielder Richard Flash was not so lucky. Flash was a highly rated player in the Birmingham area and had trials at both St Andrew’s and Aston Villa – but he caught the eye of United’s Midland scout and went to play for the Manchester Eagles. Former Manchester United youth player Richard Flash outside UCFB in Burnley . The Eagles alumni included both Terry Cooke and David Johnson who both went onto play for United and Flash became the captain of the team. But Flash’s career all but ended before it started when he dislocated his knee playing back in Birmingham. He didn’t tell anyone about the injury as he was under pressure to earn a contract with United. He told The Bleacher Report: ‘My knee never felt right, but I didn't tell anybody. I was under pressure to earn a United contract, more so because my injury was hampering my game, but I won a two-year contract after a few more trial games. Flash came through at United in 1993 - a year behind the likes of Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, David Beckham Paul Scholes and the Neville brothers . Manchester United youth team coach Eric Harrison with Giggs, Butt, Beckham, Gary and Phil Neville, Scholes and Terry Cooke . ‘I remember seeing Paul Scholes; he was tiny, and I didn't think he was any good. ‘I moved up to Manchester in 1993, still wearing my brother's boots; I'd always worn his hand-me-downs. I earned £39 per week and lived in digs with David Beckham near the Cliff training ground. ‘Pete Smith, another guy in the digs, didn't get a professional contract and became a postman. I didn't tell anyone about my knee, but I kept picking up niggling little injuries - probably associated with the knee.’ Paul Scholes became one of the best midfielders in his generation - but when Flash first saw him he thought he was too small . Flash went onto play for Graham Taylor at Watford . Injury was not the only problem for Flash and his Class of 93 teammates, twice they were caught drinking by Sir Alex Ferguson and warned about their futures. Flash added: ‘The class of '92 were regularly beating us 7-0 in training. I frequently tried to mark Scholes but struggled. I was fast, but I couldn't read the game as quickly as he could. He could turn and leave you for dust.’ His United career never really took off. He played a couple of reserve games and B Team games before being released. Flash went on to play for Wolves, Watford, Lincoln and Plymouth before calling time on his career in 1999 – the same year the Class of 92 reached their peak winning the Treble. Flash went to university and did a Masters degree. He now works as the head of the academic department at UCFB - a higher education institution delivering degrees in sports and the football industries - based in Burnley and Wembley. Looking back on his career, Flash added: ‘I look back at my football career with positive and negative feelings. I should have sorted my knee out when I first did it. I played too much in my early teens, and that led to an injury, but I made good friends at football and learned much, which helps with my current job.’ To read the full interview with Richard Flash go to The Bleacher Report as well as reading stories from Arnau Riera, Lionel Messi's first captain as a professional footballer and Richard Irving who played for Manchester United and Nottingham Forest .","Richard Flash was born in Birmingham but caught the eye of Manchester United scouts .

"Dougie Freedman has left Bolton 'by mutual consent' after almost two years as manager. The Scot looked as if he would be in charge for Saturday's match against Bournemouth but chairman Phil Gartside has decided to act. Academy director Jimmy Phillips, who was briefly joint-caretaker boss with Sammy Lee before Freedman's appointment, is the strong bookies' favourite, with Brian McDermott, Tim Sherwood, Neil Lennon and Malky Mackay also in the mix. Dougie Freedman (centre) has been sacked after Bolton's 4-0 hammering by Fulham at Craven Cottage . The Championship table . In a statement Gartside said: 'Dougie has worked tirelessly off the field to improve the infrastructure of the football club. Unfortunately, recent results on the pitch have not reflected all his work off it. 'The club has faced a difficult time following our relegation from the Premier League and Dougie has helped to restructure the club in order for it to become successful again under ever-tightening constraints. 'I would like to thank Dougie personally for all his commitment and efforts for Bolton Wanderers.' Gartside had been loyal to Freedman - who has had to cut costs and work within tighter budgetary constraints - and believed there were signs the manager was heading in the right direction. However, results and recent performances put pressure on him to make a change before Bolton get cut adrift by the teams above them. The main issue seemed to be whether they could pay Freedman off - and then who would replace him. The club also unsurprisingly announced that they had cancelled their Friday press conference. Freedman and his No 2 Lennie Lawrence leave the pitch after a chastening night for the ex-Bolton manager . Odds from Coral . 7-2 Jimmy Phillips, 10-1 Brian McDermott, Neil Lennon, Tim Sherwood, Billy Davies, 12-1 Malky Mackay, Roberto Di Matteo, 16-1 Ole Gunnar Solksjaer, Tony Mowbray, Phil Brown, Keith Hill . Bolton have won just once in the Championship this season and are second from bottom with only Blackpool - who only had eight players the day before the season started - below them. The players did not seem to be playing for Freedman and the manager, who talked in an interview last week about trying to find a settled side, chops and changes frequently - there were five against Fulham. This has led to some horrendous performances, home and away. The fans lost patience with him, too, as the vocal minority have become the majority. There were pitch invasions against Derby on Saturday and chants for the manager to go at Craven Cottage. Those supporters now have their wish.","Dougie Freedman leaves Bolton by 'mutual consent'

"Dougie Freedman looks set to stay as Bolton manager despite the club's woeful start to the season. The Scot looked to be on borrowed time following the abject 4-0 defeat at Fulham and it was thought he would be sacked by Wanderers on Thursday.

Results and recent performances had put pressure on Bolton to make a change before they get cut adrift by the teams above them but it seems as if this has been resisted.

He told the Bolton News: 'I’m here to work, I’m here to do my very best and that’s what I’m doing right now. 'I don’t think that way at all (about being sacked). I’m working very hard to turn this round. 'I don’t think the players have chucked the towel in, I think they have shown a very good spirit. They have shown a good spirit and kept on going.'
