"(CNN) -- Heavy fighting between Somali militants and African Union peacekeepers in Mogadishu, Somalia has left at least 19 people dead and 71 others wounded, according to a local ambulance group. ""What happened today was a horrific tragedy, the shelling was continuous and it was hitting a populated area of Bakara market where people were unwitting, so it was appalling many people lost parts of their body and were screaming,"" said Ali Musa, director of the amblunce group in Mogadishu. Musa said his group collected 19 died bodies and 71 people with wounds. ""The fighting started 5:30 a.m. and continued into afternoon so there was absolutely fear and chaos in Mogadishu,"" he said. Meanwhile, government spokesman Abdirisaq Mohamed Qeylow claimed that government forces pushed Islamic insurgents out of some areas. ""We have pushed the militants back and our forces have reached Howl Wadag intersection near Bakara Market,"" said Qeylow.","The violence is called a ""horrific tragedy""

"(CNN) -- Islamist fighters battling for control of Somalia have threatened to close Mogadishu's only airport, warning all airlines to stop flights into the Somali capital by early Tuesday. African Union peacekeepers keep guard recently at the international airport in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital. ""Any plane which uses or lands at the airport, we will consider it a military plane and we will not be held responsible for what happens to it,"" the Al-Shaabab militia said in a Web posting. The statement said the airport would be closed at 1 a.m. Tuesday (6 p.m. ET Wednesday). The statement was posted on www.kataaib.net, a Web site frequently used by Al-Shaabab. A graphic posted along with the statement shows a plane about to land at Mogadishu's international airport. As the plane approaches, a man with a shoulder-fired missile appears and a red-circle target is placed over the plane. The Somali word for ""Warning!"" flashes at the same time. Nairobi, Kenya-based Daallo Airlines, which operates flights four times a week into Mogadishu, is ""monitoring the situation,"" the company's chief executive officer told CNN. ""We haven't received any warning directly,"" Howard Leedham said. He said he was made aware of Al-Shaabab's warning through the local media, and would not say if any of the four weekly flights would be canceled or rescheduled as a result. ""All I can say is we're monitoring the situation very closely,"" Leedham said. ""We have employees down there, and so we're monitoring the situation."" Maj. Barigye Ba-Hoku, a spokesman for African Union forces in Somalia -- many of whom are based at Mogadishu's airport -- said he has not received an official warning from Al-Shaabab about the airport's closure, but ""we take the warning seriously."" ""We have taken precautionary measures, but that's all we can do,"" Ba-Hoku told CNN. Al-Shaabab is an Islamic militia that has launched a bloody battle to seize control of Somalia and oust Ethiopian forces, which are helping Somali government forces try to rout the Islamic fighters. It is a splinter group of the Islamic Courts Union, which pushed out Somalia's transitional government in 2006. The ICU was deposed in December of that year following Ethiopia's military intervention. In its statement, Al-Shaabab said it has been forced to shut down the airport because it is being used by a variety of ""infidel forces,"" including Ethiopia, Burundi, and Uganda. Burundi and Ugandan forces make up the bulk of the AU mission in Somalia. Al-Shaabab also said U.S. and Israeli security officials ""regularly"" land at the airport. ""So based on all these issues, we -- Al-Shaabab fighters -- are notifying all business people in Mogadishu, particularly to those of the airlines, that the airport is officially closed from the date on 16th September,"" it said.

"(CNN) -- An experienced radio journalist was killed during crossfire between Islamist rebels and government forces in Somalia's capital, a journalist rights group said. Barkhat Awale Adan, 60, was killed Tuesday afternoon while covering fierce fighting between Al Shabaab rebels and Somalia's government forces. Adan was on top of Hurma Radio station's roof in Mogadishu, helping fix a transmitter when a stray bullet hit him in the stomach, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). He was rushed to a local hospital where he was confirmed dead, the National Union of Somali Journalists (NUSOJ) said on its website. Renewed fighting between the transitional federal government and Al Shabaab rebels started Monday and continued into Tuesday and Wednesday. ""We send our deepest condolences to the family and colleagues of Barkhat Awale,"" Tom Rhodes, CPJ's East Africa consultant, said in a statement. ""Both sides of the conflict have shown no regard for the lives of journalists and other civilians. We call on African Union troops and Al Shabaab to safeguard the lives of journalists."" Somalia ranked as the second-most dangerous country in the world in 2009 for journalists, according to the CPJ, with nine journalists losing their lives there that year. Adan was the second journalist killed in Somalia in 2010. Sheikh Nur Mohamed Abkey, another radio journalist, was also killed in Mogadishu in early May. ""The violence in Mogadishu has made it extremely dangerous for media professionals to carry out their work without falling victim to the ever-flying bullets and widespread criminality,"" said Omar Faruk Osman, NUSOJ secretary general. ""We have lost, yet again, another veteran journalist courtesy of the raging hostilities."" Adan had been a journalist for 30 years, serving as director of Hurma Radio over the past four years, NUSOJ said. Somalia has long been treacherous for both Somali and international journalists. In June 2006, Martin Adler, a Swedish cameraman and journalist, was shot dead by an assailant with a pistol during a packed rally in Mogadishu. In February 2005, Kate Peyton, a British senior producer for the British Broadcasting Company, was killed when an attacker walked up and shot her in front of her hotel, also in Mogadishu. Somalia has not had an operational government since 1991, when then-President Mohamed Siad Barre's military junta was overthrown. Somalia was ranked in 2009 and 2010 as the worst failed state in the world, according to Foreign Policy magazine's annual index. Chad and Sudan, respectively, round out the top three failed states.","He is killed while covering fierce fighting between rebels and government forces .

"(CNN) -- A male suicide bomber dressed in women's clothing killed three members of Somalia's U.N.-backed interim government and 16 others Thursday when he detonated at a medical school graduation ceremony in Mogadishu, government officials and witnesses said. The Transitional Federal Government said Education Minister Abdullahi Wayel, Health Minister Qamar Aden and Higher Education Minister Ibrahim Hassan Adow were among the dead after the bomber attacked Banadir University's medical school commencement. The African Union, which leads a peacekeeping mission in Somalia, put the death toll at 19. The victims also included nine students and two doctors, according to a professor at Banadir University, while journalists said two of their colleagues died in the blast. In addition, Sports Minister Suleman Olad Roble was hospitalized in critical condition, his relatives told local media. Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed blamed the Islamist rebel group Al-Shabaab for the attack and displayed what he said was the body of the bomber for reporters, a local journalist who attended the news conference told CNN. The body the president displayed had a beard. The president also showed the remains of the suicide belt and shreds of a hijab -- a garment worn by some Muslim women to reflect modesty -- at the news conference, according to the journalist, whom CNN is not naming for security reasons. At the United Nations, the Security Council condemned the bombing as an act of terrorism against ""people dedicated to building a peaceful, stable and prosperous future for the people of Somalia."" It urged a ""thorough investigation"" and expressed hope that those responsible would ""be brought swiftly to justice."" ""The Security Council expresses its deepest sympathies and condolences to the families of those killed and to those injured in the attack, as well as to the Transitional Federal Government and the people of Somalia,"" the council's current president, Burkina Faso's U.N. Ambassador Michel Kafando, said Thursday. Video of the graduation ceremony showed Dr. Osman Dufle, the country's former health minister, speaking as the camera begins to shake -- apparently from the explosion. Afterward, Dufle told journalists that he saw a person dressed in black moving through the audience just before the blast, according to the Radio Mogadishu journalist. Al-Shabaab is made up of former allies of Ahmed, once a leader of the Islamist movement that briefly held power in Mogadishu in 2006. Adow, a Somali-American, served as the foreign secretary of the Islamic Courts Union when it held Mogadishu. But while Ahmed and other former members of the ICU accepted a U.N.-brokered peace agreement with the government they once fought, Al-Shabaab -- which the United States says has links to al Qaeda -- has rejected the peace agreement and has waged a bloody campaign against the transitional government. The African Union's peacekeeping mission AMISOM condemned Thursday's attack. It vowed to ""spare no efforts to ensure that the perpetrators of this act and such heinous crimes against humanity being carried out in Somalia"" will be brought to justice. The journalists killed were Mohamed Amiin Abdullah of Shabelle Media Network and freelance cameraman Hassan Ahmed Hagi, who worked closely with the network. CNN regularly works with Shabelle Media. The African Union condemned the attack, saying it would ""spare no efforts to ensure that perpetrators of this act and such heinous crimes against humanity being carried out in Somalia"" will be brought to justice. The National Union of Somali Journalists also condemned the attack and said it brought the number of journalists killed in the country this year to eight.

"(CNN) -- A roadside bomb attack Thursday in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, injured the nation's interior minister and killed one of his secretaries, according to a source close to the minister. The Bakaraha market in Somalia's capital is one of the most dangerous areas of the city. The mid-day attack on Abdukadir Ali Omar, a member of the transitional government, left him with shrapnel wounds to his leg. The extent of his injuries was unclear, said the source, who requested anonymity because he is not allowed to speak to the media. The explosion occurred about noon at the Bakaraha market, in one of the most dangerous areas of the city. The interior minister is a popular moderate who led assaults against Ethiopian forces during their invasion of Somalia. Ethiopian troops invaded the country at its request in December 2006. The Ethiopian invasion ousted the Islamic Courts Union, an Islamic movement that had claimed control of Mogadishu earlier that year. Thursday's attack on Ali Omar fueled concerns that moderate Islamists would strike out against the hardline Al-Shabab, which is suspected in the explosion. Al-Shabab -- which the United States has designated a terror organization -- warmly welcomed a recent call for the overthrow of Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, Somalia's new president. The call, delivered via an audio recording, purportedly came from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. -- Journalist Mohamed Amin Adow contributed to this report.","Attack on Abdukadir Ali Omar left him with shrapnel wounds to his leg .

"(CNN) -- On the day one of his former clubs marched closer to yet another title, David Beckham was relishing the prospect of making his debut for Paris Saint-Germain in one of French football's biggest fixtures. The ex-Manchester United star has been named in the PSG squad for Sunday's home clash with third-placed Marseille, the only French team to ever win the European title. ""Le Classique"" has come to prominence again following both clubs' return to fortunes -- league-leading PSG's due to an influx of Qatari cash, and Marseille's after a humiliating spell outside the top flight thanks to a match-fixing scandal. ""I played a lot of big games in my career, such as duels between AC Milan and Inter, Real Madrid and Barcelona, or the Galaxy and Chivas,"" Beckham told PSG's official website after being named in a 20-man squad. ""I think it's very exciting to discover a new very special game."" Beckham will not be the only superstar on show on Sunday -- his former Real Madrid teammate, Brazilian World Cup winner Ronaldo, has been invited to the match as a special guest. PSG coach Carlo Ancelotti was wary of confirming that Beckham will make his first appearance since agreeing a five-month deal on the final day of the January transfer window, when the 37-year-old English soccer icon promised to give his wages to a children's charity in Paris. ""He will be available but I don't want to reveal the team,"" the Italian told reporters on Saturday. ""He has worked well and is in good state physically and mentally. He wants to play and he is in a condition to start. He is capable of playing a full match."" PSG will be looking to bounce back from a 3-2 defeat by Sochaux, which left the club three points clear of second-placed Lyon. Manchester United stayed on course for a record-extending 20th English title by beating the Premier League's bottom club Queens Park Rangers 2-0 on Saturday to extend the team's lead to 15 points. Second-placed Manchester City will seek to cut that gap by beating third-placed Chelsea on Sunday, while Tottenham could go above the deposed European champions with victory at London rivals West Ham on Monday. United's top scorer Robin van Persie injured a hip in the buildup to defender Rafael's opening goal against QPR, but is expected to be fit for the Champions League last-16 clash with Real Madrid on March 5. ""He collided with a camera, which was in a dug-out piece of ground. He hit the base of it and has a very bruised hip,"" United boss Alex Ferguson said of the 19-goal Dutchman. Ryan Giggs celebrated his 999th United appearance by scoring the second goal with 10 minutes left. Fifth-placed Arsenal moved to within a point of Tottenham as Spain midfielder Santi Cazorla scored both goals in a 2-1 victory over third-bottom Aston Villa to relieve the pressure on manager Arsene Wenger. Sixth-placed Everton's Champions League hopes suffered a big blow with a 2-1 defeat at Norwich, while West Brom moved up to seventh with a 2-1 win at home to Sunderland thanks to a double from on-loan Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku. Wigan moved out of the relegation zone with a 3-0 victory at second-bottom reading, as Ivory coast striker Arouna Kone netted twice. Former Manchester United striker Dimitar Berbatov scored the only goal of the early midtable game against Stoke, his eighth this season.","David Beckham named in a 20-man squad for Paris Saint-Germain's match on Sunday .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The coalition commander in Afghanistan went to the site of a recent airstrike and apologized for civilian deaths, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said Friday. ISAF Commander Gen. John Allen paid his condolences to survivors of victims in Logar province, southeast of the capital, Kabul. Sahib Khan, a member of the Afghan parliament from Logar, said Wednesday's airstrike killed 18 people, including women and children, near the volatile Pakistan border. NATO forces said the strike occurred when soldiers returned fire during a mission targeting a Taliban leader. An ISAF spokesman said insurgents were killed and security forces seized weapons and explosives. The allegations of civilian casualties reverberated through the Afghan government and Washington as U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta arrived in Kabul for talks on Thursday. Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the strike, saying, ""NATO operations that inflict human and material losses to civilians can in no way be justifiable, acceptable and tolerable."" Afghan official: NATO airstrike kills 8 family members . Panetta did not address the controversy over the airstrike in his public remarks while in Kabul. The news came ahead of discussions between Panetta, Allen and Afghan Defense Minister Gen. Abdul Rahim Wardak. While militant attacks have caused by far the greatest number of civilian casualties in Afghanistan, many Afghans and coalition members have expressed concern about civilian deaths caused by air operations. The latest allegations of civilian casualties also come at a critical time for the United States. Though U.S. military and political officials have said publicly that Afghanistan will be ready to take over security of its country by the time NATO troops depart, critics have said there are questions about whether Afghan forces can stand on their own.","ISAF commander visited Logar province .

"(CNN) -- Somalia's transitional government has offered a general amnesty to insurgent fighters in Mogadishu who surrender and promise to renounce violence. The decision made by the Cabinet over the weekend was announced Tuesday and comes after Al-Shabaab retreated from the capital, Mogadishu, early Saturday. The al Qaeda-linked group has been waging an insurgency against Somalia's transitional government since 2006. In confirming that Al-Shabaab fighters had left the city, spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage said the fighting was hardly over. ""The reasons we withdrew from Mogadishu is we have made changes in our tactics of war,"" he told the group's radio station, Andalus. ""We withdrew because we want to save lives of the poor civilians, but we will launch operations against government (and African Union) forces in the coming hours."" Impact Your World: How you can help . Some observers said they believe the Islamists withdrew because of funding woes and drought-related issues. The United Nations has declared famine in five areas of southern Somalia, including Mogadishu. In all, about 12 million people in the Horn of Africa region need assistance. Somalia is the worst hit. ""The immediate priority must now be to focus on the humanitarian situation and I call on all parties, from the donor community to all parts of the Transitional Federal Government, to do everything possible to ensure and facilitate the immediate delivery of assistance to those most in need,"" U.N. special representative Augustine Mahiga said. Al-Shabaab has called the famine a ""crusader"" invention and an excuse for occupation, and issued threats to aid agencies delivering food to afflicted areas. As crops withered, thousands of people fled and livestock starved. But the militants kept their ban on aid groups operating in their territory in southern and central Somalia and parts of the capital.","NEW: Large areas of Somalia are suffering from famine .

"(CNN) -- Riot police sprayed tear gas at hundreds of protesters who attempted to lead a march after Friday prayers from the two main opposition party mosques in Sudan's capital of Khartoum and its second city, Omdurman. About 500 riot police surrounded a mosque and fired tear gas canisters at the crowd as they began to leave, witnesses said. Protesters responded by hurling rocks at officers. The head of the opposition Umma party -- also the last democratically elected prime minister of Sudan -- was escorted to safety out of the mosque by supporters after the clashes began. The two mosques in both cities are attended by supporters of Sudan's two largest opposition parties, the Umma and Democratic Union parties. The clashes follow calls by Sudanese activists for mass protests as world leaders condemned authorities for cracking down on demonstrators. Thousands of people are demonstrating on the streets of Khartoum and Omdurman, demanding the president's ouster over economic woes. President al-Bashir feels heat from 'Sudanese Spring' Activists say that hundreds are being detained as the clampdown intensifies. They dubbed Friday's protests ""elbow licking,"" a spoof on a phrase by the administration. An aide to the nation's leader once said that toppling the president is like trying to lick an elbow -- impossible . The demonstrations, which started June 16 at universities in the capital of Khartoum, have spread to other cities nationwide. Protesters seeking to end President Omar al-Bashir's nearly 23-year rule have seized on recent budget cuts and tax increases to demand his ouster. Police have fired tear gas and rubber bullets on protesters over the past two weeks after the government ordered a crackdown, witnesses said. A spokesman for activist group Sudan Change Now, who goes by the name Ahmed Samir for security reasons, accused the government of using gangs of plain clothes thugs, known as ""Rabatta,"" to beat protesters and reinforce the security forces. ""In Hajj Yousif district, the rabatta militias were firing AK-47's into the air. It is an attempt to intimidate but the government is in denial,"" he said. Sudanese police crack down on growing protests . ""The demands of the people are clear -- they want a revolution to sweep away this government. The austerity measures we are suffering under are a result of this government's prioritizing of military and security. They want the people to pay the price for their irrational wars."" Authorities have arrested opposition leaders and forced some to sign paperwork vowing not to participate in any more protests, the United Nations said this week. In addition, police seized injured protesters from hospitals and detained them, according to the United Nations. ""Tear gas, rubber bullets, live ammunition and other heavy-handed suppression will not resolve the frustrations and grievances of the people regarding shortcomings in their enjoyment of economic, social, civil and political rights,"" U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay said Thursday. ""Genuine dialogue with government critics is far more effective than arbitrary detention and violence if the government wishes to create a stable and successful society."" U.S. officials also condemned the clampdown and arrests. ""A government that respects the rights of its citizens to freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly in order to raise their grievances does not respond to such protests by using unnecessary force,"" said Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman. Government officials were not immediately available for comment. Growing numbers of protesters have rallied in the capital with some demonstrations turning violent as crowds burned police trucks, cut off roads and hurled rocks at authorities. In return, police have fired rubber bullets and struck protesters with batons , witnesses said. ""Leave, Bashir, leave!"" protesters chanted. ""Khartoum, please revolt against humiliation and dictatorship."" Al-Bashir has played down the protests and urged citizens to understand the new austerity measures, which lifted fuel subsidies and cut the Cabinet by half to reduce expenses. In a televised speech on state media this month, he said the measures are necessary to help mend the economy. Sudan has faced soaring inflation since it separated with South Sudan a year ago -- taking with it more than 70% of Sudan's oil reserves. Sudan relied on its crude production for revenues and exports. The nation's inflation has gone up by 30%, according to Sudanese Finance Minister Ali Mahmud. Protesters vowed to hold more rallies Saturday when the ruling party celebrates 23 years in power. Organizers are calling for mass action using social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook, where they are posting pictures and details of upcoming protests. In similar protests in January last year, students sought to replicate the Arab Spring that has swept over the Middle East. The government quashed those protests.

"(CNN) -- Seven peacekeepers from Niger were killed Friday in an ambush in southwestern Ivory Coast, and more may be in danger, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. The blue-helmeted peacekeepers were part of the U.N. Operation in Cote d'Ivoire on patrol near the border with Liberia, where threats of attacks against civilians have prompted the operation to strengthen its presence, the United Nations said in a statement. ""These brave soldiers have died in the service of peace,"" Ban said. ""I condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms."" The incident occurred near Para Village, a spokesperson for Ban said in a statement. Ban called on the government of Ivory Coast ""to do its utmost to identify the perpetrators and hold them accountable."" He added that he understood that other peacekeepers remained in danger. ""Even tonight, after the attack, more than 40 peacekeepers remain with the villagers in this remote region to protect them from this armed group,"" he said. Clinton urges Ivory Coast dialogue . A spokeswoman for the U.N. mission in Ivory Coast said Friday's incident was the first attack on peacekeepers since they entered the country in 2004. Sylvie van den Wildenberg, in a telephone interview from her office in Abidjan, said the remaining forces were continuing to protect area residents, ""who are living in a very difficult terrain -- their villages scattered."" Van den Wildenberg said it was not clear who was responsible for the attack, which occurred mid-afternoon. ""This is an area where you have so many different types of armed people,"" she said. ""People have different aims and different reasons to carry arms and to perpetrate attack. So this is a very complex environment. We can't extrapolate. We just can't fingerpoint any group."" The peacekeepers were on a reconnaissance patrol because U.N. officials had heard rumors several days earlier of armed men in the area threatening to attack a village, she said. Van den Wildenberg said she had received reports that some Ivorian citizens may also have been killed or wounded, ""but we are still checking the facts."" Because the shooting occurred in such a remote location, ""it's going to take time for us to get the information."" U.N. peacekeepers remained in Ivory Coast after the 2010 presidential election, when the country was thrown into crisis after incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo refused to acknowledge defeat to former Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara. The latter was sworn in on May 21. Gbagbo is in custody at the Hague, accused of crimes against humanity during post-election violence that killed thousands. In the statement, Ban's spokesperson said the secretary-general ""remains seriously concerned about the continued instability in the border areas between Cote d'Ivoire and Liberia since the Ivorian post-elections crisis, which has resulted in the death of a number of individuals in that region."" According to the United Nations, its peacekeeping force in Ivory Coast as of April 30 included nearly 11,000 uniformed personnel, as well as several hundred international civilian personnel, local staff and volunteers. They provide technical, logistical and security support to the government. CNN's Umaro Djau contributed to this report.","More may be in danger, U.N. secretary-general says .

"(CNN)  -- At least 75 people have been killed in clashes in the Somali capital of Mogadishu since fighting broke out earlier this week between government forces and Al-Shabaab rebels, medical sources and a witness said Saturday. At least 30 people died on Wednesday, and another 35 died on Thursday, the city's ambulance service said. Another five died of their wounds while hospitalized, according to Duniyo Ali Mohamed, medical director of Mogadishu's Medina Hospital. A local journalist whose identity is not being disclosed for security reasons said he saw five other bodies in the capital. Mohamed said at least 170 people, including 21 children, were admitted to the hospital with injuries from the fighting between government forces and the rebels. Ninety-six remain hospitalized. Mohamed said two children lost their mothers; one of the children was only 3 months old. A spokesman with the Mogadishu ambulance service told CNN that the service has picked up 148 wounded people since Wednesday, when the fighting began. He said he was particularly affected by the death of two children -- brothers who succumbed to their wounds when they arrived at the hospital. It was not immediately clear whether the two were included in the five dead from Medina Hospital. ""There is widespread hopelessness and despair in the city,"" said the ambulance spokesman, who is not being identified for security reason. He said the last remaining residents in the battle area are fleeing for their lives. Much of the fighting Thursday occurred north of Mogadishu, where a majority of militants allied with Al-Shabaab are believed to be in control, authorities said.

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- Somalia's top militant group may soon counter the government's recent thrust against them with an offensive of their own. African Union intelligence sources say Al-Shabaab is massing hundreds of troops in the African nation's embattled capital of Mogadishu for a show of force during the Muslim month of Ramadan, which begins Monday. The sources said Al-Shabaab received a shipment of weapons by sea in preparation for this offensive. They believe that Al-Shabaab allies in Yemen shipped the items across the Red Sea to Somalia. Ramadan is a period of fasting and religious reflection. Islamic radicals have chosen the period to carry out attacks against their enemies during the holy month. Fighting has intensified this summer as Somali government forces -- backed by troops from the African Union -- have battled insurgents from the militant Al-Shabaab. Somali government forces on Thursday launched an offensive on Islamist strongholds in northern Mogadishu. The U.N. refugee agency on Friday expressed concerns about ""the protection of civilians"" in Mogadishu amid the fighting. But African Union forces said the offensive was launched to counter Al-Shabaab attacks on displaced persons camps. ""An offensive on Thursday by pro-government forces in and around the important Bakara and Balcad markets has increased the risk for Mogadishu's citizens as well as the estimated 100,000 internally displaced people (IDP) who have fled drought and famine in neighbouring regions in recent months,"" the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. Since September, African Union forces said they have steadily been taking territory in the capital from Al-Shabaab. The fighting comes also as Somalia is battling its worst drought in 60 years and tens of thousands of famine-stricken people are walking for days into both Kenya and Ethiopia in search of food and water and away from the conflict between government forces and rebels. The United Nations on Friday said it is asking for a further $1.4 billion to help starving people across the Horn of Africa. The request lifts the Horn of Africa appeal to $2.4 billion, of which $1 billion has been received so far. ""More than 12 million people -- in Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti -- are in dire need of help, and the situation is getting worse,"" said Valerie Amos, U.N. Emergency Relief Coordinator and head of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. ""If we are to avoid this crisis becoming an even bigger catastrophe, we must act now."" Meanwhile, Erastus Mwencha, the African Union Commission deputy chief, visited Mogadishu to assess the humanitarian situation and announced an international pledging conference August 9 in Ethiopia.

Thousands of families have fled the capital, Mogadishu, seeking a safer environment in camps south of the city. ""The people of Somalia have once again been subjected to unbearable violence,"" said Pascal Mauchle, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Somalia. ""The daily struggle for survival is exhausting their capacity to cope."" Humanitarian groups expressed concern, too, that Somalis will not have access to medical care. The international medical agency Doctors Without Borders said it was forced to close an outpatient clinic in Mogadishu to ensure safety for its staff. ""With so few medical facilities available in Somalia, it is crucial that people are able to access those that are still functioning,"" said Alfonso Laguna, head of the agency in the region. The new round of fighting stems from an interpretation of sharia law, or Islamic law, the spokesman said. Somalia's new President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed has recently approved implementing sharia law, but the rebel group wants the country to institute a stricter form. A spokesman for the rebel group said it has recruited many fighters for the battle against the government. ""It is not only Somali jihadists that are fighting in Mogadishu against the government. There are also foreign Muslim jihadist brothers who are fighting side by side with us,"" said Sheikh Hassan Ya'qub, a spokesman for al-Shabaab. Abdiraman Abdi Shakur Warsame, minister of international cooperation for Somalia's transitional government, issued a stern warning to the rebels in an address to a young audience celebrating Somali youth day at the capital. ""The government is determined to defend itself from these religious gangs who are covering in the name of Islam and I assure you that in the course of coming days, we will eliminate these elements and some of them will be forced out of the country,"" Warsame said. The U.S. Embassy in Kenya released a statement about the fighting. ""The extremists who are instigating these attacks have no regard for the well-being of Somalis and are undermining the peaceful efforts of the legitimate government to further national reconciliation,"" the statement said. ""The United States is particularly disturbed at reports that foreign fighters and those who rejected dialogue in 2006 are participating in this effort to forcibly remove a legitimate Somali government from power.""

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II is to meet a former IRA commander, Martin McGuinness, during her visit to Northern Ireland next week. McGuinness, now a Sinn Fein politician, is the deputy first minister of Northern Ireland. The meeting is being seen as highly symbolic. Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams confirmed that McGuinness will meet the queen at an event in Belfast to celebrate art and culture across Ireland. ""Because this involves Martin meeting the British monarch, this will cause difficulty for Republicans and nationalists who have suffered at the hands of British forces in Ireland over many decades,"" he said in a printed statement. However, the party had agreed that McGuinness should meet the queen ""in the context of conflict resolution and national reconciliation, as well as our own republican national objectives,"" he said. The event is not connected with the queen's diamond jubilee celebrations, he said. ""This is a significant initiative involving major political and symbolic challenges for Irish republicans,"" Adams added. ""As the record of the peace process demonstrates, Irish republicans have frequently been prepared to take bold and historic initiatives and risks for peace to break stalemates and find agreements."" The meeting follows the queen's historic visit to the Republic of Ireland in May of last year. It was the first visit by a British monarch to the republic since it gained independence in 1921 and marked a reconciliation between neighboring countries, who once viewed each with suspicion and hostility. An IRA bomb killed one of the queen's relatives, Lord Mountbatten, in 1979. IRA members have also killed police officers and soldiers in Northern Ireland, who serve in the queen's name. The nationalist community in Northern Ireland sees the British as occupiers and wants their rule in the province to end. McGuinness has admitted that he was a leader of the Provisional IRA during the 30-year conflict in Northern Ireland between pro-British and pro-Irish forces. In recent years, he has received death threats from hard-line dissident IRA splinter groups because of his support for the peace process. He stood for Ireland's presidency last year but returned to his post as deputy first minister of Northern Ireland when his campaign was unsuccessful. Accepting his party's nomination last September, he said republicans have an obligation to ""heal the wounds of their actions."" The majority of the island gained independence in 1921, following two years of conflict, but six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster chose to stay in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the country of Northern Ireland. In the late 1960s the conflict between mainly Protestant unionists who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom and largely Roman Catholic nationalists who want the North to be reunited with the rest of Ireland exploded into a political and sectarian war, known as the Troubles. The three decades of ensuing violence between the IRA and loyalists claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people, most of them north of the border, and while the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 effectively ended the conflict, suspicions remain. For this reason the queen's state visit is more than symbolic. Under the terms of the landmark accord, terrorist groups on both sides dumped their weapons, and political allies of the two now work together in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government. Journalist Peter Taggart contributed to this report.","NEW: Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams says the meeting is part of national reconciliation .

"(CNN) -- In a show of force, Islamist militants gathered in the Somali capital of Mogadishu on Wednesday to protest an American pastor's now-scrubbed plans to burn the Quran. Chanting ""God is great"" and ""Down with America,"" crowds assembled at a stadium for a rally organized by Al-Shabaab militants. Florida pastor Terry Jones cancelled his plans to burn the Quran last weekend, but his intentions have sparked protests across the globe, including Afghanistan and in Kashmir, where anti-India unrest was fueled this week by reports of the planned desecration of Islam's holy book. Al-Shabaab has been accused by human rights groups of gross violations. The al Qaeda-inspired group has threatened African neighbors and Israel and recently claimed responsibility for bombing two locations in Uganda where fans were watching the final match of soccer's World Cup, killing at least 76 people. It also intensified its attacks in Somalia during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, with more than 200 civilians killed in battles between the militants and government troops. Somalia has been mired in chaos since 1991, when warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and sparked brutal clan infighting. A transitional government has struggled to establish authority, challenged by Islamist groups like Al-Shabaab that have seized control of parts of Mogadishu and much of the south.","Crowds gather in Mogadishu to protest a U.S. pastor's abandoned plans to burn Qurans .

"(CNN) -- Described as the largest single gathering of displaced residents in the world today, tens of thousands of civilians are seeking shelter along the Afgooye corridor outside Mogadishu, according to the United Nations. Members of the U.S. Navy take a young Somali boy to safety after rescuing him and 51 others adrift in a skiff. Fighting between government forces and Islamist militias has triggered the flight of more than 67,000 Somalis in and around Mogadishu since May 8, the U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday. Most of them are heading to the Afgooye corridor, a 30-kilometer (19-mile) stretch of ramshackle housing described by the United Nations' World Food Program as ""a nightmare."" The corridor between Mogadishu and the town of Afgooye is already home to 400,000 displaced Somalis, some of them living in huts made of twigs and branches. The clinics are already overwhelmed with malnourished and sick children. This week, Somalia's transitional president, Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, asked the international community ""to help Somalia defend against foreign militants who have invaded the country."" Ahmed told local journalists Monday that he feared these foreign fighters would turn Somalia into another Iraq or Afghanistan, where U.S.-led forces are fighting Islamic extremist groups. The fighting has cut supplies of ""desperately needed humanitarian aid"" to the displaced Somalis near the capital city, according to the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. ""We are starting today the distribution of aid for some 50,000 people in Afgooye corridor through our local partners in Somalia,"" the refugee office said Tuesday. ""Today's distribution will include cooking sets, plastic sheeting, blankets and mats."" The number of Somali refugees fleeing to nearby countries also continues to rise, with some 500,000 already in Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Djibouti, Eritrea and Tanzania. Many Somalis have also made the dangerous journey across the Gulf of Aden to Yemen. On Saturday, a U.S. guided missile destroyer rescued a group of 52 Somali men women and children -- including a woman who was eight months pregnant -- who had been stranded aboard a small skiff for nearly a week off Somalia's coast, the U.S. Navy said.  See photos of the rescue » . A helicopter based on the USS Lake Champlain happened to spot the stranded mariners, according to the vessel's commanding officer. ""It's fortunate that our helicopter was flying over the right place at the right time,"" Capt. Kevin P. Campbell said in a U.S. Navy news release. ""I'm glad we were able to be of assistance and rescue these men, women and children. Our chief hospital corpsman stated that had we not found them at the time we did, the pregnant woman may not have survived."" USS Lake Champlain has been deployed as part of the U.S. 5th Fleet's mission to patrol the Gulf of Aden region, which has been plagued by pirate attacks off Somalia's coast. ""We were very fortunate to have come across these people in the state they were in,"" said the ship's chaplain, Lt. j.g. Jarrod Johnson. ""Seeing their condition really makes your heart go out to them. You can see the relief and hope in their eyes, and hear it in their conversation.""","Fighting has triggered flight of more than 67,000 Somalis since May 8 .

"(CNN) -- Syrian authorities announced changes in the country's media law as opposition groups provided accounts of regime brutality and claimed new deaths. The new laws would prohibit publication of a range of content and would hold editors, journalists and even media spokespeople accountable for violations. They prohibit media outlets from publishing content that affects ""national unity and national security,"" incites sectarian strife, incites crimes or ""hatred,"" or harms state symbols. The laws also forbid publishing news related to the armed forces. The legislation states that editors-in-chief, journalists and even ""the spokesman at a media outlet"" can be held accountable for actions that constitute a violation of the law. It also establishes an independent panel to regulate the ""information sector."" A statement on the changes cites the need to balance ""freedom of expression"" with ""responsibility and awareness."" In the meantime, one opposition group accuses government security forces of rights violations, including holding civilians hostage. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights cites eyewitnesses in several cities, who claim that authorities are threatening the family members of wanted activists, holding them hostage and destroying homes. The regime is forcing activists to turn themselves in by arresting members of the activists' families, including children and elderly people, the group says. Authorities are also burning the homes of activists or their families if information is not forthcoming. Additionally, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says authorities are warehousing arrestees in former Baath party youth camps.  These camps do not have the health care or hygiene facilities to accommodate the large number of people detained.  Witnesses say detainees are being given only one inadequate meal a day. The group also accuses Syrian authorities of violating both Christian and Muslim places of worship, as well as arresting doctors and burning pharmacies. Another opposition group said Sunday that continuing protests have led to more fatalities. Four people were killed in demonstrations across the country Sunday, according to the Local Coordination Committee.  Two died in Idlib, according to the group, after heavy gunfire from Syrian security forces. On Saturday, the Arab League Council called for restraint and an end to bloodshed in Syria in the midst of ongoing violence and unrest. ""The council expresses its concern about the deteriorating in Syria,"" the group said in a statement on its website. Syria's regime has come under criticism and pressure for its harsh crackdown on demonstrators. World powers have called for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down. Last week, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said that more than 2,200 people have been killed in Syria since mid-March, with more than 350 people reportedly killed since the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on August 1.","NEW: Syrian authorities announce new rules for journalists .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Intense rains let up in parts of northwestern Pakistan on Thursday, giving humanitarian groups a chance to get more aid to the millions of people suffering. The dry skies were a respite for areas battered by the heavy rains, which left behind bloated rivers and covered whole neighborhoods with flood waters. But heavy rains were still pounding some parts of the country, including Punjab and Sindh provinces. The flooding -- caused by torrential monsoon rains -- has destroyed thousand of homes, crushed many bridges and affected 3 million people, officials said. As many as 1,500 people have died in what has been called Pakistan's worst flooding in 70 years. ""Today is going better. It is sunny and drier, but the destruction is all around us. Most of the villages have been washed away by water,"" said Joseph Prior Tio, who's working with Doctors Without Borders in Pakistan's Swat Valley. Another big issue is the many left without electricity, Tio said. ""We are fighting to get safe water to many areas,"" Tio said ""There is simply no electricity anywhere in the entire valley. All over the valley there are about 1 million people who depended on electricity to get basic services such as safe drinking water."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday urged Americans to donate to relief efforts, saying that experience in post-earthquake Haiti showed that small donations can make a big difference. Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani appealed to residents to curtail expenditures for Ramadan feasts and upcoming independence day celebrations, and instead help their suffering compatriots.","Rain lets up in some areas of flood-hit Pakistan .

"MOGADISHU, Somalia (CNN) -- Fresh fighting between Ethiopian-backed government forces and Islamic insurgents in Somalia's capital city of Mogadishu reportedly killed at least 10 people Sunday, eyewitnesses said. A man walks past the rubble of a building destroyed in Sunday's fighting . The two sides pounded each other with artillery, sending children scurrying and bringing business at the city's main market to a standstill. ""The fighting is so heavy and a barrage of mortar bombs is hitting many parts in Bakara market, killing people and causing heavy damages of buildings "" said Ali Abdulkadir, a cloth trader at the city's main Bakara Market. Hawo Abdi Oman, another eyewitness at the market, said a shell landed in an area crowded with people, killing nine civilians. Among the dead, she said, were two children and four women. The market, a rebel stronghold, has been the site of numerous clashes since early last year. In a nearby neighborhood, Geed Jaceyl, a shell landed on a house, crushing it. A woman who was inside was killed, witnesses said. A second shell landed near a religious school, sending children running for cover. No one was injured in that incident. The presence of Ethiopian troops trying to help defend a transitional government's hold on Mogadishu has united Islamic militant groups seeking to gain control of the city. In 2006, the Islamic Courts Union -- a militia group -- ousted Somalia's transitional government from power. But the ICU was deposed in December of that year following Ethiopia's military invasion. Since then, insurgent groups have been trying to destabilize the government. Somalia's current transitional government is trying to maintain control of the capital, with the help of the better-equipped Ethiopian forces. The violence has displaced more than 40,000 civilians who have taken shelter in dozens of makeshift settlements west of Mogadishu. Somalia has been mired in chaos since 1991, when warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and sparked brutal clan infighting. Sunday's fighting came a day after suspected insurgents killed a local reporter, who freelanced for the BBC and Reuters news agency. The national union of journalists in Somalia called the death of Nasteh Dahir Farah a ""targeted assassination."" He was the 10th reporter killed in the war-torn nation since last year. Farah, 36, was gunned down on his way home from work in the southern city of Kismayu, according to the National Union of Somali Journalists. -- Journalist Mohamed Amiin Adow contributed to this report .","Fighting between government forces and insurgents in Mogadishu kills at least 10 .

"(CNN) -- Malawi said it won't host an African Union summit next month because the organization wants Omar al-Bashir, the Sudanese leader accused of war crimes in Darfur, to attend. Activists hailed the small and economically struggling southern African nation's stance, announced by Malawian Vice-President Khumbo Kachali on state radio Friday. Al-Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and genocide, but he has eluded arrest. Malawi is one of many countries that ratified the Rome Statute, which created the ICC, and those nations are obliged to carry out the court's orders, including its arrest warrants. ""While we have obligations to abide by decisions of the AU, we are also under obligation to other international agreements including the Rome Statutes,"" Kachali said. Kachali said the summit appears to be headed to the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, also the AU headquarters. Sudan asked the AU to move the meeting there after Malawi said al-Bashir would not be welcome. Undule Mwakasungula, director of the Malawi Center for Human Rights and Rehabilitation, is quoted in a Human Rights Watch news release Friday that ""Malawi has done right by Darfur victims today."" ""Malawian President Joyce Banda took a strong stance in support of justice despite tough pressure from the African Union,"" he said . The AU, the organization of countries across the African continent, has said before that its members shouldn't cooperate with al-Bashir's arrest. Al-Bashir made trips abroad for meetings despite the ICC warrants against him crimes in the Darfur region, where rebels have fought government forces and allied militiamen such as the Janjaweed since 2003. Malawi welcomed al-Bashir last year for a regional trade meeting when the country was led by President Bingu wa Mutharika. The Human Rights Watch said Chad, Kenya and Djibouti have permitted him on their territory. But other countries have canceled visits or have said that the wanted president is unwelcome. ""Malawi joins an increasing number of countries that have declined to welcome al-Bashir,"" said Alan Wallis, international justice lawyer at the Southern Africa Litigation Center, quoted by Human Rights Watch. ""More states should follow Malawi's example."" Banda became president in April after Mutharika died. After she took power, she said Malawi would host the summit but stressed that al-Bashir wouldn't be welcomed because of the arrest warrant. the Human Rights Watch said. Banda has said that Malawi would lose all-important donor support if it invited al-Bashir to the country. ""Civil society groups across the African continent have repeatedly urged governments to arrest -- not host -- al-Bashir,"" said Elise Keppler, senior international justice counsel at Human Rights Watch. ""African activists have called for their governments to stand with victims, not with suspected war criminals.""

"(CNN) -- Steps were being taken to guard against a new threat of ""body bombs"" planted inside passengers aboard flights heading to the United States from overseas, a government official with knowledge of the threat said Tuesday. Authorities have increased aviation security, especially on air carriers heading to the United States from the United Kingdom, other parts of Europe and the Middle East in the days surrounding the one-year anniversary of the death of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, said the official, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the information and to protect the specifics of how the risk came to light. ABC reported on Monday officials fear al Qaeda may soon attempt to explode United States-bound aircraft with the body bombs. The body bomb threat has surfaced before, but the renewed concern is based on new information originating overseas, the official said. Details of the threat have been shared among intelligence agencies in the United States and the United Kingdom within the past two weeks, the official said. An FBI official declined comment on the information, but said, ""the FBI takes all threat stream information seriously and runs it down to the best of our ability with all available resources."" Department of Homeland Security spokesman Peter Boogaard said Monday authorities have ""no indication of any specific, credible threats or plots against the United States tied to the bin Laden anniversary."" Navy SEALs killed bin Laden during a raid on a Pakistani compound on May 2, 2011. ""DHS will continue to monitor intelligence reporting and respond appropriately to protect the American people from an ever-evolving threat picture, and as always, encourage the public and our partners in law enforcement and the private sector to remain vigilant in promptly reporting any suspicious activities,"" he added, declining comment on the ABC report. Speaking before the ABC story was published, a separate law enforcement official claimed not to know of any security increases but said each locality makes its own decision. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, similarly said that there is ""no intelligence to indicate a credible threat"" of attack to coincide with the anniversary of bin Laden's death. Body bombs gained worldwide attention in 2009 when al Qaeda's chief bomb-maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, built a device containing around 100 grams of PETN, a difficult-to-detect powdery explosive, that was designed to be inserted inside the rectum of a suicide bomber. The suicide bomber was his younger brother, Abdullah al-Asiri. Their target was Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the head of Saudi counterterrorism, whose security services had driven them out of Saudi Arabia two years earlier. Their group, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, was determined to show that even well-protected targets outside Yemen were not beyond their reach. In the end, the attack failed. Despite gaining entry to bin Nayef's residence by claiming to be defecting, Abdullah al-Asiri killed only himself; the head of Saudi counterterrorism was just slightly injured. But even in failure, his brother and comrades were emboldened. Never had al Qaeda come so close to killing a member of the Saudi royal family.

"(The Frisky) -- When you break up with someone, how do you expect the people in your life to treat your ex? On a recent Sunday, I read the ""Modern Love"" column in The New York Times which explored that topic in an essay by Charles Antin. Antin had an amicable, cold-turkey breakup with his girlfriend of five years, and then found himself morosely following her life in the aftermath via Facebook. When his ""technophile"" grandfather joined the social networking site and befriended his ex -- because of their shared love of Frangelico, it seems --  Antin was angry. The column ends with a bit of a whimper -- Antin confronted his grandfather, who ended up quitting Facebook entirely -- but it got me thinking about how we expect our family members and friends to treat our exes, and how we expect their family and friends to treat us, whether the breakup was amicable or not. When my ex and I broke up, I didn't have much to worry about on this front. While I was friendly with his friends and he was friendly with mine, we didn't really have mutual friends, so it wasn't like anyone was in a position of ""choosing sides."" My family had never been close with him because we hadn't spent too much time with them as a couple, so they had no interest in keeping in touch with him. And really, given the way things went down, everyone in my life kind of hated his guts. A few of my friends were Facebook friends with him before we broke up, and when we split, most of them asked if they should defriend him or not. I said, ""No,"" because obviously someone needed to be keeping tabs on his relationship status changes, as well as post and tag photos of me looking happy for him to see. So I've never been in the position of having to really ""think"" about how I wanted my friends to treat my ex. They've been doing it right since the second we broke up. However, one of my primary concerns when we broke up was how it was going to affect my relationship with his mom. Even though I hadn't ""done"" anything, would she still feel comfortable maintaining contact with me? And even if she did want to remain a part of my life in the months after the breakup, what about when my ex brought home a new girlfriend for her to meet? Would her friendship with me get in the way of her developing a bond with a new, potential daughter-in-law? And what did he think of his mom still keeping in touch with his ex -- the very same ex who has, well, given him a piece of her mind on this very site (all of which could have been read by his mom)? The Frisky: Is fighting healthy in a relationship? All of this was weighing heavily on me in advance of my 30th birthday. Though my almost-mother-in-law and I had vowed to keep in touch, I hadn't spoken with her since before I found out and wrote that my ex had likely cheated on me with his coworker (and lied about it) and had also lied about an incident early on in our relationship involving his ex-girlfriend. Since the last time we spoke, I had written about all of these things, as well as sent my ex an extremely angry and accusatory email (which he didn't acknowledge), and I was worried a little that he had maybe bad-mouthed me to his parents -- i.e., told them I was crazy -- in an attempt to cover his butt, should they confront him about the things I wrote about (in the event that they still read The Frisky). I hesitated to check in with them because I didn't know what kind of reception I would get. I was pretty confident his mom knew me well enough that she wouldn't believe any lies he might tell and, despite everything, I had a hard time really believing my ex could be that vindictive. Turns out, my instinct was right --his mom texted me on my birthday, as did his sister. It was a wonderful birthday present, knowing he hadn't tried to taint their view of me and that they still very much wanted to keep in touch. The Frisky: When is the ideal time to get married? I talked to his mom a few days after my birthday and we avoided the subject of my ex almost entirely, though she did say she had mentioned to him that she had wished me a happy birthday. She said he seemed a little weird about it, which I suppose is fair and normal. I respect him for not getting angry or demanding that we cease contact, I respect his mom for, well, not really caring whether it bugs him, and I am doing my best to respect the relationship(s) in general, by not making him a topic of conversation when we do speak. Of course, if I actually did want to discuss my ex with his mom -- and aside from a burning curiosity about whether he has introduced his parents to the aforementioned coworker, I really don't -- that would be a sign that the friendship between us isn't the healthiest thing for me, as I take the final steps in moving on with my life. So, as far as keeping up relationships with an ex's family and friends goes, proceed with caution. The Frisky: Forgiveness goes a long way .

"Washington (CNN) -- Supporters of California's voter-approved ballot measure banning same-sex marriage in the state asked the U.S. Supreme Court Tuesday to allow it go back into effect. At issue is whether the Constitution's 14th Amendment guarantee of ""equal protection"" prevents states from defining marriage as only between one man and one woman. The justices will decide in coming weeks whether to put this hot-button social issue on its docket. If it agrees to take the appeal, oral arguments would likely be held early next year. In February, a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled the measure unconstitutional. In its split decision, the panel found that Proposition 8 ""works a meaningful harm to gays and lesbians"" by denying their right to civil marriage. Chick-fil-A wades into a fast-food fight over same-sex marriage rights . The same sex marriage issue is working on two legal tracks. The high court is currently considering separate appeals over the congressionally authorized Defense of Marriage Act, which also defines marriage for federal purposes as only between one man and one woman. The justices have the ultimate discretion to refuse taking on the issue. The ""Prop 8"" case, as it has become known, has been down a complicated legal road. California's Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriages were legal in 2008. After the statewide ballot measure banning them passed with 52% of the vote later that year, gay and lesbian marriages were put on hold. Currently, same-sex marriage is legal in six states: Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York, along with the District of Columbia. Washington and Maryland voted earlier this year to allow same-sex marriages, but the laws have not yet taken effect. Another five states -- Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey and Rhode Island -- allow civil unions, providing state-level spousal rights to same-sex couples. President Barack Obama, who previously opposed same-sex marriage, said in June he now supports it. ""When I think about those soldiers or airmen or Marines or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet feel constrained, even now that 'don't ask, don't tell' is gone, because they are not able to commit themselves in a marriage, at a certain point I've just concluded that for me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married,"" the president told ABC News. The state law's supporters, led by a coalition of groups under the ProtectMarriage.com banner-- urged the justices in their 500-plus petition to preserve the will of the voters in this politically charged social issue. ""Californians of all races, creeds, and walks of life have opted to preserve the traditional definition of marriage not because they seek to dishonor gays and lesbians as a class, but because they believe that the traditional definition of marriage continues to meaningfully serve society's legitimate interests, and they cannot yet know how those interests will be affected by fundamentally redefining marriage."" California is the only state that accepted, then revoked, same-sex marriage as a legal right. Opponents of Prop 8 urged the high court to expand the ""traditional"" views of marriage. Episcopal Church approves same-sex blessing service . ""The president of the United States, a majority of the American public, two federal courts and most of America's NATO allies view marriage equality as a fact,"" said Rick Jacobs, founder of the Courage Campaign. ""We can only hope that the Supreme Court will once again act for all Americans on the right side of history, not for a few hysterical ones scared of love."" In the separate issue over congressional authority, a federal appeals court in Massachusetts this spring struck down a key part of the 1996 Defense of Marriage law as unconstitutional. The issue before the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was whether the federal government could deny tax, health and pension benefits to same-sex couples in states where they can legally marry. The Massachusetts case was appealed recently to the U.S. Supreme Court. The California appeal is Hollingsworth v. Perry.

"(CNN) -- The battle over same-sex civil unions in Colorado did not end when a legislative committee killed a measure to allow them Monday, leaders for both sides said Tuesday. ""We will keep fighting to equality and #civilunions,"" State Rep. Mark Ferrandino, the leader of the minority Democrats, said in a Twitter posting after a committee voted 5-4 not to sent the bill to the house floor. Colorado House Speaker Frank McNulty, who assigned the bill to a committee where he knew the majority Republicans would opposed it, acknowledged Tuesday that the civil unions debate ""is not over for the year."" ""It's pretty clear (the Democrats) are attempting to use this as an agenda item heading into the November elections,"" McNulty told CNN in a phone interview. ""McNulty fights against equality & thwarts democratic process voters will remember,"" Ferrandino, the bill's sponsor, tweeted Tuesday. McNulty accused Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, of trying to divide Coloradans by calling the special session to consider the civil unions bill. The speaker sent the bill to the State Veterans and Military Affairs Committee, which Ferrandino called McNulty's ""kill committee,"" so the process would ""move as efficiently as possible"" to allow legislators to ""refocus our efforts to put Coloradans back to work."" ""Colorado has an unemployment rate that is still far too high,"" McNulty said. McNulty disputes Hickenlooper's claim that the civil unions bill is not a same-sex marriage measure, which the Colorado state constitution prohibits. ""The bill itself makes the case for that,"" he said. ""It really is creating the concept of same-sex marriage."" It would lead to a costly legal fight over its constitutionality, he said. ""There's no doubt in my mind this would happen."" The civil unions bill cleared committees in the last days of the regular session, but was filibustered by Republicans in the final days, Hickenlooper said. He called this week's special session to complete the work. ""They wouldn't let it come to the floor, and when it died, 30 other bills died. And these are important to our businesses,"" the governor told CNN. McNulty said it was ""a last-minute, divisive attack on our traditional views on marriage for short-term political gain."" McNulty suggested there was a link between what is going on in Colorado and President Barack Obama's announcement last week that he supports same-sex marriage. ""To me, it's more than a simple coincidence that all of this is happening at the same time,"" McNulty said. ""Bills die on the calendar every year and we don't have a special session as a result of it."" A civil union is a legal status created by the state of Vermont in 2000, and subsequently adopted by a number of other states, according to Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, in a posting on its website. ""It provides legal protection to couples at the state law level, but omits federal protections as well as the dignity, clarity, security and power of the word 'marriage.'"" Obama said last week that he supports letting states decide the issue of same-sex marriage on their own, but added that he was ""disappointed"" by last Tuesday's vote on the issue in North Carolina, where a ban on same-sex marriage was added to the state constitution. Obama believes the amendment is discriminatory against gays and lesbians, a spokesman said Wednesday. Five U.S. states allow civil unions for same-sex couples, but not marriage. Six states -- Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York -- and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, while 31 states have voted in favor of constitutional amendments that seek to define marriage as a heterosexual union. In February, Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire signed a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage beginning in June, but opponents there have pledged to block the bill and called for voters to decide the issue. Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley signed into law a bill that permits the state's same-sex couples to wed as of January 1, and state residents may vote to affirm such a law. Minnesota will vote on a state constitutional amendment similar to the one in North Carolina, while Maine will have a referendum on allowing same-sex marriage. Meanwhile, two cases seeking to overturn laws forbidding the practice, one from California and another from Massachusetts, could be headed to the U.S. Supreme Court in coming months.

"Washington (CNN) -- Gay service members who want to marry often can't have the ceremony on military bases in the United States. It's not the Pentagon that has authority, but the states where the bases are located. Many states that are home to some of the nation's largest military bases have outlawed same-sex marriage, including North Carolina, Texas and California. So if a gay military couple wants to get married in those states, they can't, even on U.S. military property. Said Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta: ""State law controls in that situation. So you know, where state law provides for that, then obviously that kind of marriage can take place. And if the law prohibits that, then it cannot take place on a military base."" If Republicans on the House Armed Services Committee have their way, no gay marriages will take place on any military bases. In a straight party-line vote, the GOP members of the HASC voted Thursday to include a provision in the new defense authorization bill outlawing any gay marriage ceremonies on military bases. On Wednesday, President Barack Obama became the first sitting president to publicly support gay marriage, but Panetta declined to follow in his boss's footsteps. ""You know I'm not going to render a personal opinion on that. As secretary of defense I'm responsible for enforcing the law and giving the best defense advice we can to the president of the United States,"" said Panetta, who is a staunch Roman Catholic. Even though there was similar criticism to the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell,"" Panetta cited a study about the aftermath of the repeal DADT, saying, ""It's not impacting on morale. It's not impacting on unit cohesion. It is not impacting on readiness.""","Gay marriages can't occur on military bases in states that have outlawed the practice .

"(CNN) -- A political battle is shaping up in the Garden State about whether to give gay and lesbian couples the right to wed -- a move that, if approved, would make New Jersey the seventh state in the nation to legalize same-sex marriage. How the issue plays out was the subject of a series of political thrusts and parries this week between a Democratic-controlled state legislature and a Republican governor, who supports New Jersey's civil unions but opposes same-sex marriage. Gov. Chris Christie, a conservative favorite once thought of as a potential presidential contender, called Tuesday for a state-wide referendum to settle the issue. ""This issue that our state's exploring, whether or not to redefine hundreds of years of societal and religious traditions, should not be decided by 121 people in the statehouse in Trenton,"" the governor said during a town hall meeting. ""The institution of marriage is too serious to be treated like a political football."" The referendum would put the decision into the hands of residents of New Jersey, where recent polling suggests that those in favor of legalizing hold a slight majority. It would also largely absolve Christie from making good on a pledge to veto the bill during a legislative session -- a move that analysts say may help preserve his conservative credentials, while presumably stealing a win from Democratic lawmakers who have long pushed for the measure. A recent Quinnipiac University poll found that 52% of New Jersey voters are in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage. But Christie's Democratic opponents argue that a referendum shouldn't be used to decide civil rights issues, pointing to historic legislative and judicial decisions regarding the rights of African Americans and women. ""We do not put civil rights questions on the ballot,"" Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg said Tuesday. ""With all due respect to my colleagues at the other side of the table, a couple of them took a cop out."" Christie's statement Tuesday also frustrated gay-rights advocates, whose spirits were buoyed a day earlier with the governor's nomination of Bruce Harris, New Jersey's first openly gay state Supreme Court justice if confirmed. ""It's abhorrent to put civil rights on the ballot,"" said Steven Goldstein, chairman of a gay and lesbian rights group called Garden State Equality. ""They want to corrupt the political system with donor money. The kind of money that we can't raise."" The likelihood of a referendum reaching voters is uncertain given the makeup of the Democratic-controlled state legislature. Activists, in opposing such referendums, often point to the politics of Maine and California. In 2009, Maine state legislators passed a same-sex marriage bill that drew subsequent challenges by opponents who pushed for a referendum that ultimately overturned the law with 53% of the vote. Still, gay rights advocates in Maine this week garnered thousands of signatures in an effort to force a second referendum in November. In California, a 2008 public vote outlawed gay and lesbian couples' right to wed. Two years later, a federal district court overturned the voter-approved measure known as Proposition 8, saying couples were unfairly denied their rights. The ban has remained in place during the appeals process and could soon get a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court. Similar battles have also unfolded in Maryland and Washington state, where same-sex marriage opponents have pressed for referendums to counter bills that appear to enjoy growing support in their state houses. Earlier this week, Mary Margaret Haugen -- once considered the holdout vote in Washington's 49-member Senate, said she would step in as the crucial 25th vote in order to pass the marriage bill. Supporters say the legislation already has a majority behind it in the state House of Representatives, and Washington's Democratic Gov. Christine Gregoire pledged to sign the bill if passed. But opponents told the Senate Government Operations Committee that they aren't done fighting. Joseph Backholm, director of the Family Policy Institute of Washington, said the issue should be put to a public vote. ""If we as a state are going to take the position that mothers and fathers are interchangeable and replaceable, if we are going to send a message to fathers and potential fathers in this state that it isn't important to be in the lives of their children because dads specifically don't matter, that is something we should all do together,"" he said. In June, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed into law a bill that made his state the sixth to legalize same-sex marriage, more than doubling the number of Americans living in places that permit such unions. Five other states -- Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont and New Hampshire -- and the District of Columbia currently grant same-sex marriage licenses. With Hawaii and Delaware joining the list earlier this month, five other states now recognize civil unions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. New Jersey, Illinois and Rhode Island also recognize civil unions providing state-level spousal rights to same-sex couples. CNN's Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report .","Gov.

"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- A human rights groups has called for an end to the ""sweeping crackdown"" on political activists in Oman, following a spate of detentions in the Gulf state over the past two weeks. A statement by the Gulf Center for Human Rights said that 22 people were arrested on June 11 at a rare protest in Oman's capital, Muscat. An official with Oman's Ministry of Information declined to comment on the arrests to CNN. Oman's public prosecutor, however, released a statement Wednesday accusing activists breaking Omani law by using social media to incite unrest. ""It has been noticed that there are growing participations and negative writings on discussion forums, social networking websites and mobile applications,"" Oman's Public Prosecution said in a statement issued through the official Oman News Agency. ""These writings include libels, spreading rumors, provoking sit-ins and strikes."" Oman, which is strategically located across the Strait of Hormuz from Iran, was relatively immune to the Arab Spring protests that swept across much of the region last year. Small-scale sit-ins and demonstrations, however, over economic conditions and wages erupted sporadically in March 2011, mostly in the nation's oil-rich northern region. Despite government pledges of reform, the protesters detained this week were demanding the release of activists reportedly arrested following a worker strike at an oil facility last month. ""Omani activists are speaking out about broken promises for government reform,"" said Joe Stork, the deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""Instead of listening, Omani authorities are arresting and prosecuting them to silence them."" The detained activists -- including writers, bloggers and at least one poet -- reportedly held a peaceful sit-in outside a Muscat police station for three days before it was quelled by dozens of security officers in riot gear. Social media users in Oman shared photos of the protest on Twitter and Facebook, including pictures of several men apparently sitting in the back of what appears to be a security vehicle after the detentions. One of the detainees arrested Monday was Ismail al-Meqbali, according to Human Rights Watch. A relative of al-Meqbali, who lives in Oman and requested to remain anonymous for fear of arrest, said in a phone conversation with CNN that al-Meqbali wrote publicly about the need for reform online. ""He never insulted the system in Oman, but as a human rights activist, he always spoke against what he thinks is unjust for some,"" the relative said.","Gulf Center for Human Rights: 22 people were arrested at a rare protest in Oman's capital .

"(CNN) -- A coalition of civil rights organizations has filed a motion in federal court seeking to block an Arizona law that requires officers to make immigration checks while enforcing other laws if ""reasonable suspicion"" of illegal immigration exists. The so called ""show me your papers"" provision is perhaps the most controversial aspect of Arizona's tough immigration law, SB 1070. The U.S. Supreme Court last month, in response to a challenge by the Justice Department, struck down three provisions of SB 1070, but upheld the police immigration checks. The civil rights groups asked the court to block implementation of the law while they make their case that the provision is unconstitutional. Even though the Supreme Court upheld the provision, the civil rights organizations say they are presenting new arguments and new evidence against it. In the motion, the organizations argue that the provision in question will result in extended detentions while statuses are being checked, violating the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches. The motion also argues that the provision violates the Equal Protection Clause because ""racial or national origin discrimination was a motivating factor in its enactment."" It also calls for an injunction to another part of SB 1070 that makes it a state crime to harbor immigrants who are in the country illegally. ""In a state that's more than 30 percent Latino, requiring police to act as immigration agents is an invitation to racial profiling on a massive scale,"" Omar Jadwat, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project, said in a statement. ""Police chiefs and communities know these laws don't work, and we hope that the courts will continue to block them from going forward."" According to the ACLU, the new evidence shows that lawmakers who supported SB 1070 used false statements and discriminatory language with the intention to impose a statewide practice of racial profiling. The motion was made on behalf of plaintiffs in Valle del Sol v. Whiting, et al., a class action lawsuit challenging SB 1070, filed in May 2010. In addition to the ACLU, those presenting the motion include the National Immigration Law Center, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. Earlier this month, federal officials said they had not seen a change in the number of illegal immigration checks sought by local Arizona police as allowed by the partially upheld law. The Phoenix Police Department and at least two sheriffs in Arizona told CNN that the law won't result in great change for their departments. But Tucson Police Chief Roberto Villasenor expressed concern in an interview after the ruling about whether his 950-officer agency has been dealt an ""impossible mandate."" The state law allows citizens to sue his department or others if they fail to enforce federal immigration laws, the chief said. ""Just for my agency, it will be a huge workload, just making the calls and waiting for a response on what to do,"" the police chief of Arizona's second-largest city said. ""I'm not sure the federal government is capable of handling all the requests that they will be receiving,"" Villasenor added. ""I don't know what effect it will have on my agency.""","A coalition of civil rights groups wants to block parts of Arizona's immigration law .

"Washington (CNN) -- In an election year that some pundits have predicted will be focused on jobs and the economy, social issues like same-sex marriage have stolen the spotlight a surprising number of times. But experts say don't expect those hot-button topics to be the ultimate markers of the 2012 cycle. On Wednesday, President Barack Obama officially came out in support of the right of Americans to marry same-sex partners, ending a streak of ambiguity over his position that has long perplexed supporters of marriage equality. ""I've just concluded that for me, personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married,"" Obama told ABC News. His now-evolved statement came one day after North Carolina became the latest Southern state to pass an amendment banning same sex-marriage and domestic partnerships. Obama's campaign issued a statement last month opposing the amendment. But pressure had grown on the White House to go further after Vice President Joe Biden said Sunday, in response to a question on a talk show, that he was ""absolutely comfortable"" with same sex-marriage. Obama had said only that his position was ""evolving"" after having once opposed same-sex marriage. On Monday, Education Secretary Arne Duncan also showed support for same-sex marriage. Marriage-equality advocates quickly pounced on the statement, ramping up pressure on Obama to do so as well. ""Standing up for the freedom to marry is not just the right thing to do, it's the right thing politically, and it's time for the president to stand on the right side of history,"" said Evan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry, an advocacy group. Political observers say the president was simply playing smart politics. With a Gallup poll showing the country is split over the issue -- 50% of voters support the practice, while 48% oppose -- Obama had a fine line to walk in terms of political impact. Opinion: Obama's most courageous moment . ""While this president can point to successes in advancing gay civil rights, much more than I think any other president, that final step (of endorsing same-sex marriage) would leave him open to a series of negative attacks that could really alienate swing voters,"" CNN political contributor John Avlon said Tuesday, before the president made his statement. Several other states are dealing with the issue this year. Washington, Maryland, Colorado and Maine have passed or are poised to pass legislation in favor of same-sex marriage, while Minnesota will vote on a ballot initiative similar to North Carolina's. Analysts say the move could prove to be risky for the president this fall, especially in key swing states like Indiana, North Carolina and Virginia, which have strong conservative bases and demographics that might take issue with the president's stance. ""It's going to have some political cost for him,"" predicted Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor. ""He will lose some Reagan Democrats, the cultural blue-collar Reagan Democrats in states like Ohio and North Carolina and Pennsylvania -- important swing states."" Opinion: Support for same-sex marriage growing in GOP . But some argue the move was a bold one, which could poll well among independents looking for ""conviction"" in the White House. ""You'll never agree with everybody on every issue, but now he's taken the position that is clearly in his heart,"" Paul Begala, a senior adviser for the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA Action, told CNN. ""People admire a 'conviction politician,' and I think he can stand proud on that."" Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney reiterated his position on the issue after Obama's interview on Wednesday, drawing a stark contrast with that of the president. ""My view is that marriage itself is a relationship between a man and a woman, and that's my own preference,"" he told reporters in Oklahoma. ""I know other people have differing views."" In an interview earlier in the day, he said he supported domestic partnership benefits and hospital visitation rights for same-sex couples. However, in the past, Romney has expressed support for a federal amendment banning gay marriage and has said that he, unlike Obama, would defend the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman. This isn't the first time a social issue has appeared front and center this cycle. In February, the Obama administration's so-called contraception mandate sparked a wave of opposition from Republicans, who decried a requirement that institutions affiliated with religions include contraception coverage in their health care plans. iReport: What's your take on this issue? The outcry ultimately influenced the administration to amend its proposal so that insurance companies, not the institutions, would pay for contraception coverage. That episode was part of a larger Democratic-led narrative that paints the GOP as waging a ""war on women."" As another example, Democrats point to a bill recently signed by Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell that requires any woman desiring to undergo an abortion to first be given an ultrasound test. Hitting back, Republicans seized on comments made by Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen, who last month criticized Ann Romney for having ""never worked a day in her life"" as a stay-at-home mother. The GOP argued her comments reflected a cultural bias among Democrats against Republicans. But will same-sex marriage prove to be a key issue in the presidential election? With a number of states voting this year on the issue, experts say it will probably make a few more headlines but will unlikely be the biggest issue of 2012. The fact that North Carolina, a traditionally conservative state, voted to pass the amendment is no surprise and indicates little about voters' attitudes on same-sex marriage, said Professor Andrew Koppelman of Northwestern University Law School. But if social issues do play a prominent role this cycle, Obama would come out ahead in the resulting debate, said Koppelman, who has done extensive research on the legal implications of same-sex marriage. ""People who feel most strongly about same-sex marriage are either strong Democrats or strong Republicans,"" he said. ""The people who could go either way are people who are worried about the economy. If the economy does not look like the winner for Romney, it's hard to imagine him pulling it out with this."" Koppelman said Obama's support for same-sex marriage will likely energize his base -- but he added that the statement is about all the president can do in terms of affecting the issue. ""Ultimately, it's up to the courts to decide,"" he said. ""Really, all that he can do is try to be an opinion leader here. He hasn't got any real power."" A Pew Research Center survey in April showed same-sex marriage to be low on voters' minds, with the issue coming in dead last out of the 18 topics listed. Only 28% of voters described it as a ""very important issue"" this election year. Jennifer Pizer, legal director at The Williams Institute, which studies sexual orientation, law and public policy at UCLA, said she would be surprised if the issue comes into play this fall, despite its appearance on states' ballots and the president's changed position. ""I suspect the issue might have played some role in North Carolina, which will be contested,"" she told CNN in an e-mail. ""But with the marriage vote having happened just now, it seems unlikely to still be much on voters' minds six months from now."" She added that Obama's comments may fuel ongoing discussion among pundits and politicos, but doubts voters will view the issue as a highly important one this fall. ""The overwhelming majority of Americans already enjoy the right to marry the person they wish to marry, and are not directly affected by laws prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying,"" she said. ""Those laws just don't affect their families, let alone their jobs, their children's schools, or whether they are able to take loved ones to the doctor.""","Experts say they don't think same-sex marriage to be a deciding issue in November .

"New York (CNN) -- In court documents filed Tuesday, New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman challenged the constitutionality of the federal Defense of Marriage Act in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The controversial legislation, often called DOMA, defines marriage for federal purposes as unions only between a man and woman, and excludes same-sex unions, even those valid under state law. According to a news release from the DA's office, the filings come as part of the ongoing case of Windsor v. United States and call for the court to acknowledge Schneiderman's assertion that DOMA violates same-sex couples' constitutional right to equal protection under the law. Windsor v. United States started with a suit filed by Edith ""Edie"" Windsor, who lived with her same-sex partner, Thea Spyer, for more than four decades. They married in Canada in 2007, but neither the federal government nor their home state of New York recognized the legal union. According to court documents, Spyer died and left her estate to Windsor. Because she was not considered a legal spouse, Windsor was forced to pay the corresponding estate taxes on the inheritance. Her suit challenges this decision and seeks a refund of the money she had to pay. In Tuesday's court brief, Schneiderman argues that ""in redefining the term marriage, Section 3 of DOMA violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, and must therefore be invalidated."" He goes on to say that the law is an ""improper intrusion on the traditional role of states in defining marriage."" He says it discriminates on the basis of sexuality and sexual orientation, and ""does not advance any legitimate federal interest."" Last month, New York passed the Marriage Equality Act, allowing for gender-neutral marriages for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. On Sunday, the first legally recognized gay marriages took place in the state. During his campaign for attorney general last summer, Schneiderman pledged to get involved in the federal debate over DOMA and challenge it in the courts. In a statement from his office Tuesday, he said, ""The State of New York has long recognized out-of-state, same-sex marriages, and the enactment of the Marriage Equality Act further cements our state's position on this critical civil rights issue. My office will fight every day to defend the fundamental guarantee of equal protection under law for all New Yorkers.""","He says DOMA violates same-sex couples' constitutional right to equal protection under the law .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Pacific Gas and Electric Company must pay $38 million for safety violations in connection with a Christmas Eve 2008 explosion and fire in northern California, officials said. The penalty is the largest safety violation fine for a utility in California history, said Andrew Kotch, spokesman for the California Public Utilities Commission. The fine was larger than the $26 million recommended to an administrative law judge, but the judge imposed the bigger fine, which was approved Thursday by the commission, officials said. The explosion and fire were caused by a natural gas leak. They destroyed a house in Rancho Cordova, California, near Sacramento, authorities said. One person died and five other people, including a utility worker and a firefighter, were injured. The commission said PG&E committed safety violations that included not following its internal procedures after discovering the installation of a gas pipe with a wall thickness below specifications; not administering drug and alcohol tests after the Rancho Cordova explosion to all employees ""whose performance on December 24, 2008, under the circumstances presented, could not be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident""; and making an ""unreasonably delayed and not effective"" response to a neighborhood resident's phone call about an outdoor gas leak odor. ""This decision sends a signal that California is taking a firm stand on integrity and safety in its gas distribution infrastructure,"" Timothy Alan Simon, the commissioner assigned in this proceeding, said in a statement. PG&E can't raise rates on customers to recover any portion of the penalty and other costs associated with the commission's decision, and the fine payment will be turned over to the state's general fund, the commission said.","NEW: The fine is largest ever for safety violations by a utility in California history .

"Anaheim, California (CNN) -- As tensions roil between Latinos and city officials over accusations of police brutality, Hispanic activists will press the Anaheim City Council for a way to have at least one elected Latino to represent them, leaders said Thursday. Their pledge to continue their grass-roots campaign came after the City Council rejected Wednesday night a ballot measure that would have established voting districts, including at least one to represent Latino neighborhoods. The measure, voted down 3-2 after more than three hours of passionate appeals by residents, would have ended how city council members are now elected at-large. Latino residents feel that under the current conditions they are not being represented adequately -- especially in the wake of videotaped violent confrontations between police and Latino residents. Last month videos captured protestors confronting Anaheim police and officers shooting rubber bullets at mostly Latino residents. One video also shows a police dog running at several people and biting a man in the arm. The City Council is scheduled to meet again August 21, and Latino residents said they would be back to call for city leadership to reflect the diversity of the community. ""When you have a representative that lives in the neighborhood and that is elected, he's responsible to address the needs of that community,"" said MartÃ­n LÃ³pez, a community activist. ""I believe if we had districts, it would be easier for these people to deal with the socio-economic problems from our communities that have been forgotten."" Anaheim resident Juan Alvarez is the son of Mexican immigrants who supports the districting ballot measure, but told CNN he has an issue with the idea that new representatives have to be Hispanic. ""I think it's all about what does a representative have to say, how are they going to fix the issues, what can they do for the community and how can they serve. That's the way we should choose our officials,"" Alvarez said. ""But definitely districting will help alleviate a lot of the issues."" Currently, 52% of the city's 336,000 residents are Latino but few have held public office. The City Council struck down the ballot measure saying it needs to be studied more and instead they will put into place a citizen's advisory committee on elections and community involvement. Anaheim Mayor Tom Tait was among the supporters of the measure to elect council members from districts. ""I believe Anaheim residents should have a say in how they want to be governed,"" Tait told CNN. ""District elections bring government closer to the people. Whether this is accomplished through the courts or the vote of the people, district elections are Anaheim's future."" Also in attendance was Genevieve Huizar, the mother of Manuel Angel Diaz, the 25-year-old unarmed man whom a police officer shot to death last month. Bob Dunn, spokesman for the Anaheim Police Department, said the officer fired in self-defense. Police said Diaz was a gang member and held a concealed object in his front waistband with both hands. Police added that Diaz had a criminal record that included various drug charges. ""The entire family of Manuel Diaz is disappointed in the council's vote yesterday, although she appreciates the efforts of the council that voted in favor it,"" Dana Douglas, attorney for the Diaz family, told CNN. The mother ""wants people to demonstrate and make their voices heard, but peacefully. She's not going to stop until there is justice for her son's dead and fair treatment for all the people of Anaheim,"" said Douglas. When Huizar spoke at the council meeting, she was interrupted by a person who yelled, ""You are a bad mother!"" This caused commotion as the man who shouted the comment immediately left the meeting. Diaz's family filed a $50 million lawsuit July 24 in Orange County Superior Court against the Anaheim police department and the officers involved in the shooting. According to Douglas, the money that Huizar recovers for the death of her son will be used to create a community center or some other facility in her son's name to benefit underserved children in the community. A day after Diaz's death, police killed another man, Joel Acevedo, 21, after a brief pursuit that involved Acevedo allegedly opening fire on police. The violence sparked outrage within the community and a series of protests aimed at the police. On July 24, hundreds of demonstrators flooded the streets of downtown Anaheim vandalizing shops, including smashing the windows of a Starbucks and looting apparel from retailers at the Anaheim Towne Center mall. The violence was at odds with how Anaheim is home to Disneyland, which markets itself as the ""happiest place on Earth."" The American Civil Liberties Union also filed a lawsuit July 28 in Orange County Superior Court suing the city of Anaheim for violating the California Voting Rights Act by excluding the city's Latino community with the at-large process to elect city officials. The suit seeks to change Anaheim's election policies by adopting districting to guarantee diversity in representation. Some Anaheim residents at Wednesday's meeting said the change needs to start with the police department in order to rebuild the relationship between the city and its residents. ""I would like for the officers to be more patient, not to be so scared. Just because of one man, doesn't mean that everybody's the same,"" said Anaheim resident Perla Castillo. ""There's people that are nice, that are hard workers and if there's riots and stuff it's because they don't have answers."" Other Latino residents at the meeting expressed their support for the actions of the police department. ""I really think that the community needs to look at themselves,"" said Anaheim resident Alexandra Araiza. ""And realize that their kids might be the problem."" Anaheim police officers have shot seven people, killing five, since January 1 and said the shootings are a result of the increase in gang-related crime in the last year. Mayor Tait said he asked the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles to investigate the Diaz and Acevedo shootings, but said the city would not tolerate unlawful protests. Meanwhile, more than 17,000 Orange County residents signed a petition that was delivered July 30 to the California attorney general's office and seeks a state investigation of the Anaheim police in the wake of the fatal shootings, according to Presente.org, a national Latino advocacy group that collected the petition signatures. ""We're trying to do the best we can in the neighborhoods that are controlled by gangs,"" said Anaheim Police Chief John Welter. ""We don't want to be seen as law enforcement to come in and just do nothing but be an occupying army of a neighborhood. ""We want to have a good relationship with our residents so that they can do more about helping us stop the crime before it occurs.""","Anaheim City Council says no to a ballot measure about creating election districts .

"(CNN) -- Two bodies have been found in Yosemite National Park in recent days near where three hikers were swept over a 317-foot waterfall last July, officials at the park in California said Monday. The body of one of the three was recovered two weeks after the incident. In July, witnesses said the three -- two men and a woman -- climbed over the guardrail at the top of a trail and went into the gushing river that feeds the waterfall, known as Vernal Fall. They were quickly swept over. Park officials said in a statement Monday that a body found by a park ranger last Tuesday was determined to be that of Ninos Yacoub, 27, of Turlock, California. The man's body was found in the Merced River about half a mile below the base of the waterfall, the statement said. Hidden dangers in Yosemite . Yacoub was with Hormiz David, 22, of Modesto, California, and Ramina Badal, 21, of Manteca, California, when the three disappeared over the waterfall. David's body was recovered in August about 240 feet from the base of the waterfall. A third body was found last Saturday in the same general location of where Yacoub's body was located, park officials said Monday, and authorities are likely to make a positive identification ""within the next several days.""","Ninos Yacoub was one of three hikers swept over a waterfall in July .

"(CNN) -- As he admitted himself this week, Roger Federer has no idea how long his career may last but tennis fans in Dubai were guaranteed another chance to see him after the Swiss survived a first round scare against Tunisia's Malek Jaziri. The reigning champion -- bidding for his sixth title at the Dubai Tennis Championships -- had to come from behind to win 5-7 6-0 6-2 against the World No. 128, who was playing his first ATP World Tour match since October. ""It was a difficult match for me out here tonight, but I'm happy I found a way and got a day off now so I can work a little bit on the game,"" said Federer, who beat Andy Murray in last year's final. ""Just maybe the pressure is off a little bit, and then automatically I will play a lot better in the second round."" In the run-up to Monday's game, Federer -- who will play either Marcel Granollers or Albert Montanes (both of Spain) in the next round -- revealed he will undertake a far lighter schedule this year. The 31-year-old will take nearly two months off after the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, which runs from March 4-17, before returning in May to play the Madrid Open. The Swiss says the break will allow him to take a holiday with his wife and twin three-year-old daughters before spending 4-6 weeks practising on clay courts in Switzerland. ""The last few years have been really tricky in terms of my practice schedule, especially through an Olympic year [in 2012],"" said the 17-time grand slam winner. ""This year is totally different. Family is very important, so I also want to spend quality time with them."" ""I can't play a year like I did last year every single season because that isn't the point I'm at in my career. I'm not 22 where I have to play 25-30 tournaments a year. Plus, I believe I'll be really ready for the tournaments I've entered."" Federer is planning to play just 14 tournaments in 2013, even dropping his home town event in Basel and the Miami tournament, which has often been described as the biggest outside the four grand slams. Federer, who won Wimbledon but lost the Olympic final last year, may be vying for the top honours with Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray but his chances of success are threatened by being nearly five years more senior than the next oldest. ""I'm trying to be smart with my scheduling because I'm in a totally different situation than they are,"" he said. ""Your prime is 23 to 27-28 so for me it's very challenging -- and exciting. I need to make the right decisions. I have family and not many guys have that."" Considered by many as the greatest of all time, Federer stressed that his lighter workload is intended to prolong his playing career and insists it is not a sign of him winding down. ""I strongly believe I have more slams in me,"" he rallied. ""I can play great, but will I be allowed to? Time will tell. ""My big focus is on making sure that every tournament I enter I am perfectly prepared. I am hopeful I will get enough matches but if not my schedule can be changed."" ""I want to give myself the best chance to play as long as I can. Maybe then it will become clear that it is time to stop. Things change very quickly, and you have to be ready and open about it. ""But I would like to give myself the chance to play for many years to come. I am happy with the way my body is. I am healthy and happy to be playing. ""If I feel confident and am enjoying it, I hope to play for a long time. I think I am playing excellent tennis. Some win grand slams at 16 and others at 34. It depends how you see things."" In Monday's other opening games of the US$2.4m championships, seventh seed Andreas Seppi of Italy turned around a 0-4 losing run against Paul-Henri Mathieu to beat the Frenchman 6-3 7-5. Seppi will next play Czech Lukas Rosol, who beat Italian qualifier Matteo Viola 6-3 7-5, while Russia's Mikhail Youzhny beat Blaz Kavcic 1-6 6-1 6-3. Next up for Youzhny will be Daniel Brands, who beat fellow qualifier Florent Serra 7-6 (7) 6-4, while Roberto Bautista of Spain made it through when beating Belgium's David Goffin in straight sets. On Tuesday, the 32-man field will be further whittled down -- with Novak Djokovic among those entering the action, with the World No. 1 taking on fellow Serb, and childhood friend, Viktor Troicki.","Roger Federer comes from a set down to beat Malek Jaziri .

"(CNN) -- A small town in Maryland is setting a precedent in eco-friendly road construction, breaking ground this week on one of the greenest streets in the nation. The tiny port town of Edmonston in Prince George's County is billing the thoroughfare as the greenest on the East Coast. The road will help clean and filter toxic storm water pollution that drains into rivers, and eventually into Chesapeake Bay. ""What we're hoping to do, from top to bottom, is build a street that is completely environmentally sustainable, "" said Edmonston Mayor Adam Ortiz. Ortiz says the blueprint incorporates native tree cover to cool off the streets, wind-powered street lights that use high-efficiency LED bulbs, and pedestrian and bicycle access . But most important, says Ortiz, is the plan for all that water that rolls down the streets when it rains. ""[It's] not going to be flushed into our local rivers. Instead it's going to be naturally filtered. And that's very important for us to save our rivers and to help save the Chesapeake Bay here in Maryland."" Storm water runoff often carries toxins and pollution from parking lots and city streets, and from farms and agricultural lands in rural areas. Most cities and towns have underground concrete drain systems that collect the runoff and dump it into rivers and streams, pollutants and all. ""What we're going to do, instead, is divert that water into natural gardens. To the naked eye it just looks like a regular garden, but actually it's very specially engineered to absorb a lot of water and naturally filter it before it gets into the water table, and to keep it from washing all those pollutants into the river,"" according to Ortiz. The storm water runoff in Edmonston drains into the nearby Anacostia River, which feeds into the Washington Channel, then empties into the Potomac River and eventually Chesapeake Bay. The eco-street project includes using porous bricks in building the road and creating bioretention cells or rain gardens. The idea is to trap the polluted runoff water, sending it through natural filter systems so that when it makes it into the Anacostia, it's a lot cleaner. Maryland Department of the Environment Deputy Secretary Robert Summers hopes this new main street in Edmonston is just the first of many. ""This kind of green infrastructure project to reduce storm water and energy consumption is exactly the kind of thing we need to do around the bay watershed to reduce pollution."" Summers says the benefits of this project are twofold: a reduction in storm water pollution and, through the energy efficiency in powering lighting, a reduction in air pollution and fallout. But how much can converting one street really help in cleaning up an area the size of the Chesapeake Bay? Summers acknowledges this is just the beginning. ""We need to grow it by leaps and bounds."" The Edmonston green street project is funded by the Environmental Protection Agency through a $1.1 million Recovery Act grant. Summers says the state of Maryland has already allocated $20 million for other green projects and that this is the first of many projects. The District of Columbia, Virginia, and Pennsylvania are also reviewing this green technology to eventually help do their part to clean up Chesapeake Bay. And in the Northwest, Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon, have already taken steps to clean and control polluted storm water runoff. ""Our goal is that other towns and cities and communities will steal our ideas,"" Edmonston Mayor Ortiz said. ""We'll know we're successful when we see these technologies used in other places.""","New road will help clean storm water pollution that drains into rivers, Chesapeake Bay .

"Washington (CNN) -- Many have tried, especially in California, but few have managed to successfully oust a U.S. governor through a recall election. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker faces that possibility Tuesday, due to Democratic outrage over steps last year by Walker and his Republican colleagues in the state legislature to weaken public unions. If Wisconsin voters toss out Walker in favor of Milwaukee's Democratic mayor, Tom Barrett, it will be only the third such electoral ousting of a governor in American history. North Dakota kicked out Gov. Lynn Frazier in 1921, and California got rid of Gov. Gray Davis in 2003, according to the Center on the American Governor at Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute of Politics. Gubernatorial recall efforts seem to be a state pastime in California. Every governor elected since 1968, including Ronald Reagan, were targeted by recall attempts, the center's website says. In total, 19 states permit recall elections for governors and other state officials, including Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and, of course, Wisconsin and California, the center says on its website. The District of Columbia also permits recall elections, and Virginia allows recall by trial, according to the center.

"(CNN) -- Gov. David Paterson pledged to keep fighting for same-sex marriage in New York after the state Senate on Wednesday killed a bill that would have legalized the practice. The bill had Paterson's support and had passed the state Assembly. Supporters predicted a close vote going into Wednesday's Senate debate. But eight of Paterson's fellow Democrats, including two members of the Senate leadership, joined a unanimous Republican caucus on the 38-24 vote. In a statement issued Wednesday afternoon, Paterson said, ""It is always darkest before the dawn. ""As disappointed as we are today, let's get up tomorrow and redouble our efforts,"" he said. ""We are going to lay the foundation to make people feel comfortable to vote their conscience and not fear political backlash.""   iReport: Protesters flock to Times Square . Supporters promised to bring back the bill for ""as many do-overs as is necessary to get us home,"" as Majority Leader Pedro Espada put it before the vote. ""There's never a good time for civil rights. There's never, ever, ever, ever a good time for civil rights. I know. I get that,"" said Sen. Tom Duane, a Manhattan Democrat who was the chamber's first openly gay member. ""But the paradox is, it's always the time to be on the right side of history."" Only one senator spoke against the bill during Wednesday's debate. Sen. Ruben Diaz argued that the issue should be put to a statewide referendum and pointed out that 31 states have banned same-sex marriages in statewide votes. Diaz, a Democrat and a Pentecostal minister from the Bronx, said many New York religious leaders opposed the bill and called on Republicans to join him in defending ""traditional values."" ""If we take it to the people, the people oppose it,"" he said. But a Marist College poll released Wednesday found that 51 percent of New Yorkers questioned favored legalizing same-sex marriage, with 42 percent opposed. A June poll by Qunnipiac University poll reported a similar spread of 51 percent to 41 percent.   iReport: Signs read 'I un-heart NY' And Sen. Eric Adams, a Brooklyn Democrat, said that most of the 31 states Diaz cited as voting against same-sex marriage ""at one time or another sold blacks into slavery."" ""Because the majority is in one place does not mean they're in the right place,"" he said. ""We're in the position right now where we have to lead the country to the right place."" Passage would have made New York the sixth U.S. state to legalize same-sex marriage and only the second, along with New Hampshire, to do so without a court's prodding. Connecticut, Vermont, Massachusetts and Iowa also have legalized marriages between gay couples, but federal law bars recognition of those unions across state lines.

"(CNN) -- He might have walked alone in a crowd of 15,000 fans, but for one Italian soccer fan that lonely experience has resulted in internet stardom. The unusual story of Arrigo Brovedani, who was the only Udinese supporter to turn up to the club's top-level away game earlier this week, has swept around the world. ""I feel a little overwhelmed, I don't think I deserve all this attention!"" the 37-year-old told CNN on Thursday. Brovedani has had a memorable few days. He went to Sampdoria's stadium in Genoa on Monday evening expecting few fellow Udinese fans -- but he didn't expect to be the only one. A wine seller, he had been in the city on business, having started the four-hour drive from the northeastern city of Udine that morning. ""When I travel to away matches, there's about 200 or 80 of us but on Monday, because of the time of the game and the location I thought I wouldn't find more than five or six people there,"" he said. ""When I got there I found out I was the only one. I understand that it's cold now, it's a long drive plus, the economic crisis doesn't help, so people are not moving en masse as you would expect. I was lucky because I'm used to traveling and just happened to be in the area."" The stewards at Stadio Luigi Ferraris gave him the option of sitting in the main stand, but Brovedani chose the deserted away end. Liverpool squeeze into Europe League knockout stages . ""The home fans started booing, shouting and insulting ... the usual,"" he said. ""But when I saw that the Udinese players were warming up I shouted out to them saying, 'Guys, I'm all alone here. Alone! You can hear me now but you won't be able to hear me once the game starts!' ""When the home fans eventually understood what was happening, they gave me a huge round of applause. They were cheering even though Sampdoria lost the game in the end. They were actually really nice -- they offered me food and coffee and the club manager gave me a shirt, which was nice."" Brovedani has since been swamped with media requests as the popularity of his story grew. He said he has been invited to a Premier League game in England by broadcaster the BBC, Udinese officials have asked him to come to the club's next home match and Italian TV stations ""keep calling me."" ""I don't think it's that big a story -- there are so many keen fans that really never miss a game, so I'm sure I'm not the first one!"" he said. Udinese, which last season finished third in Serie A to qualify for the preliminary rounds of Europe's top club competition this term, has an average home attendance of 18,000. Monday's 2-0 win at Sampdoria lifted the team into the top half of the table, with captain Antonio Di Natale among the scorers. He personifies the fierce loyalty the club inspires, refusing lucrative offers to join bigger sides. Brovedani, meanwhile, is happy to support anything from his home region. ""I'm not a representative of the Udinese fan club, I'm just passionate about all things that my region has to offer -- from sports to food and everything inbetween,"" said Brovedani, who hails from the town of Spilimbergo. ""I've been a Udinese fan for years, since I was a little boy. Udinese represents my region: if you come from Friuli, you have to be a Udinese fan. ""I always carry a flag and my scarf with me in the car. Whenever there is a sporting event that involves people from my region I just go along, because I'm very proud of my origins.""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, who took his renewed pitch to cut taxes for the middle class to Iowa Tuesday, and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney ratcheted up the tense back and forth over outsourcing work overseas in an appeal to those hit hardest by the economic downturn. At its core, the debate is a fierce battle to win the support of middle class voters -- especially those in battleground states. The Obama campaign continued hammering Romney over his private equity firm, Bain Capital, which ""owned companies that were pioneers in the practice of shipping work from the United States to overseas call centers and factories making computer components,"" according to a television advertisement released Saturday. Obama's campaign has also been forcefully pushing a Washington Post report that calls Romney's former private equity firm, Bain Capital, a ""pioneer"" in outsourcing jobs overseas. The campaign has made the report a focal point of its ads against Romney, and the president frequently mentions it in his stump speeches. Romney and the GOP have spent the past few days fighting back against the Obama campaign's line of attack that when the former Massachusetts governor was at Bain Capital he outsourced jobs overseas to the detriment of middle-class American workers. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who was also in Iowa as part of a GOP strategy of ""bracketing"" the president's public appearances in battleground states, unveiled a new website, called ObamanomicsOutsourced.com, which the RNC said shows instances where the president's policies have led to job creation overseas. Romney addressed the issue during a stop in Grand Junction, Colorado. ""It is interesting that when it comes to outsourcing that this president has been outsourcing a good deal of American jobs himself by putting money into energy companies -- solar and wind energy companies that end up making their products outside the United States,"" Romney said. ""If there's an outsourcer-in-chief, it's the president of the United States, not the guy who's running to replace him."" In response, Obama's campaign said: . ""President Obama has fought continuously to end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas, fostered incentives for companies to bring jobs back to America and doubled the rate of trade enforcement actions we've taken against China to ensure an even playing field for American workers,"" the statement read. In addition to Priebus' event, Romney's campaign is also pointing to a new story in The Washington Post that details criticism of Obama for allowing domestic jobs to shift overseas. ""American jobs have been shifting to low-wage countries for years, and the trend has continued during Obama's presidency,"" states the article, published online Monday night. During his campaign rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, a state the president won by 10 points in the 2008 election, the president held a roundtable discussion with an Iowa family and then talked about middle-class tax relief at a campaign event. That message included a call to pass a one-year extension of the Bush-era tax cuts for households making less than $250,000 a year and let cuts for wealthier Americans expire. ""We're going to have two choices in this election. And one choice is to take us down a path of top-down economics and an approach that says if we do good for folks at the very top, somehow everybody benefits,"" Obama told the crowd. ""And my vision, which says, when we grow best it's because our middle class is doing well and everybody who's fighting to get into the middle class."" Obama's renewed push to extend the tax cuts also serves to steer the conversation from Friday's news of relatively stagnant job growth rate and an unemployment rate of 8.2%. The mission for both candidates, political experts say, is to frame their messages in a way that makes it clear each empathizes with the plight of those who are struggling to make ends meet. Facing a tough re-election fight against Romney, the Obama campaign seeks to frame the contest as a debate between the president's goal of restoring middle-class opportunity versus GOP policies that it says would primarily benefit corporations and wealthy Americans. For Obama that message is, "" 'We're coming back. We're producing jobs and we're trying to restore fairness,' "" said Robert Lehrman, who was a speechwriter for dozens of Democratic political figures, including former Vice President Al Gore, and is author of ""The Political Speechwriter's Companion."" Romney's challenge is to shake the image of a wealthier, disconnected business executive and convince voters that his experience as a leader in his field gives him the qualifications to be the nation's leader. For Romney the message is, ""There are too many people out of work and it's terrible,"" Lehrman said, adding that Romney needs to make clear that he ""feels for the people who are having a hard time."" A recent CNN/ORC International poll conducted June 28-July 1, with 1,517 adult Americans, including 1,390 registered voters, also indicates that while voters are divided on whether Obama or Romney would do a better job on the economy, Romney holds an edge among crucial independent voters in the race for the White House. Forty-eight percent of registered voters say the president would better handle the economy, with 47% saying Romney would do a better job. President Obama's re-election team is working overtime to paint Romney as someone who is rich and out of touch. The campaign has kept up the attacks on Romney over what is described as his lack of transparency. A new Web video released by the Obama campaign Tuesday claims that the presumptive GOP presidential nominee is ""defying calls to release more than one year's worth of tax returns."" And at a Las Vegas speech for the National Council of La Raza convention, a large Latino civil rights group, Vice President Joe Biden continued the campaign's recent blitz against Romney over reports of his offshore investments. In January, Romney released his tax returns for 2010 and an estimate for 2011. Federal campaign law does not require candidates to release tax returns, but it does require candidates to file annual financial disclosure paperwork, which Romney has done. However, the Obama re-election team often points to Romney's father, the late George Romney, who released 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in 1968. ""His son has released one year of his tax returns. Making a lie of the old adage: Like father, like son,"" Biden said. As the campaigns continue the messaging slugfest, there are some pitfalls they must avoid, Lehrman said. ""The worst thing for Obama to do would be to sound apologetic all the time or to say we haven't done all that we wanted to do,"" Lehrman said. For Romney, the worse thing ""would be to concede too much to what the administration has done. But I don't think there's any chance Romney would do that."" CNN's Becky Brittain, Tom Cohen, Ashley Killough, Paul Steinhauser and Jessica Yellen contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama, Romney argue over who sent more jobs overseas .

"(CNN) -- In an outrageous recent fundraising letter the Democratic National Committee solicited funds from the party faithful on the grounds that the DNC was the last remaining bulwark against a series of anti-election-fraud initiatives ""in more than 40 states."" That's right, the DNC appears to be standing up for potential fraud â€” presumably because ending it would disenfranchise at least two of its core constituencies: the deceased and double-voters. Across America, Republican and Democratic legislatures have put forth voter identification laws this year to protect the constitutional values of equal protection and one person one vote, and for good reason. Election fraud is a real and persistent threat to our electoral system, with allegations cropping up in every election cycle. Just in December, for example, a prosecutor in Indiana launched an investigation into allegations that some fraudulent signatures on petitions may have allowed President Obama to get on the ballot in that state's 2008 primary. Unsurprisingly, 69% of 1,000 likely voters, according to a recent Rasmussen poll, believe voters should be required to show photo identification before being allowed to vote. But Democrats in Washington disagree. And in their fundraising letter they even went so far as to reference the despicable Jim Crow laws of the segregated South. Will Crossley, the DNC's counsel and voter protection director, wrote, ""Republicans are introducing and passing laws that make voting more difficult."" He went on, ""If that infuriates you...there's something you can do right now. Help us keep up the fight by donating to support Democrats."" But the DNC's premise is fundamentally flawed. It rests on the assumption that it is harder for certain groups of voters to cast their ballots because they don't have access to proper identification. This overlooks the fact that states include provisions to provide free identification cards to those who can't afford them. Moreover, a study for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, reported that voter participation increased for the 2008 election in states such as Indiana and Georgia, even after the passage of stronger elections laws. The disastrous results that opponents predicted never materialized. Voter identification laws are common sense and an effective way to combat election fraud. And, according to the U.S. Supreme Court, they are constitutional. In 2008, the court upheld Indiana's voter ID law, saying it could find no evidence that the new requirements burdened voters. And that all raises the question: Why the hostile letter from the DNC? I'm afraid it may reveal something very disturbing: Democrats know they benefit from election fraud. Consider the sordid tale of the liberal organization Acorn, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. In 2008, Acorn was responsible for 400,000 faulty voter registrations, including those of deceased individuals, nonresidents, previously registered voters and fictional characters. Other voter fraud allegations surfaced in at least 10 states. That same year, the outcome of the election in many states was determined by a fraction of that many votes. In other words, fraudulent registrations have the potential for significant consequences. And here's the thing to remember: Acorn's political arm enthusiastically supported Obama's candidacy, and Democrats have long defended the organization. There are other examples of faulty or fraudulent voting. In the 2010 midterms, 5,000 non-citizens voted in the Colorado Senate race, according to a study by the Colorado State Department. It also found that 12,000 non-citizens were registered to vote in Colorado. In Illinois, an analysis of Census data earlier this year revealed that 14 counties have more registered voters than voting-age residents, due in part, one county clerk said, to slowness in purging voter rolls when residents move. In my home state of Wisconsin, recent legislation attempted to curb voting irregularities, which were of such concern that the Milwaukee Police Department commissioned an unprecedented two-year investigation. The 2008 report warned that some instances of illegal voting in the 2004 election left open the possibility of an ""illegal organized attempt to influence the outcome"" of a state election. In an effort to show that voter fraud is not isolated to a handful of states, the Republican National Lawyers Association recently began documenting known cases of voter fraud. To date, they have found at least one documented case of fraud in each of 46 states over the last decade. And no one knows how many instances of fraud go unnoticed. Something has to change. If not, fraud will dilute the power of the individual's vote and destroy the integrity of our system. The sole purpose of voter identification laws is to avoid that fate.

"(CNN) -- We in the media seem to be dealing with a whole lotta liars: . A college football star who told the world he had met his imaginary girlfriend. A cycling champion who lied about doping for a decade. A coach who abused boys and covered it up. And that's just from the wide world of sports. What's clear, as these stories have unfolded, is that journalists don't possess lie-detector machines. But they do have BS detectors. And these are apparently getting rusty. Take the case of Manti Te'o, who confessed to Katie Couric in an interview broadcast Thursday that, well, he kinda made up the minor detail that he had met his imaginary girlfriend. He was ""going to be put on national TV"" after saying that the girlfriend had died, Te'o told Couric. ""You know, what would you do?"" Um, tell the truth? Opinion: Te'o story, big fail for sportswriters . We still don't know whether the Notre Dame star was in on the hoax earlier. But we do know he didn't want to ruin the heartwarming story line that the media utterly swallowed -- that his play was inspired by the girlfriend's demise. Couric, by the way, did a masterful job of poking holes in Te'o's tale while also expressing empathy for a troubled young man. Yet the lack of journalistic skepticism on this heartwarming tale of tragedy was stunning. No one had seen the girlfriend. Te'o said he mainly communicated with her online. There were no pictures of them together. Watch: How Katie Couric artfully exposed Manti Te'o . The malfeasance was even worse after Lennay Kekua's alleged death. Pete Thamel of Sports Illustrated has acknowledged that he ignored a number of red flags. No obituary for Kekua. No funeral notice. No record of what Te'o described as an earlier car accident. No mention of her in Lexis Nexis. No record of her brother's name so he could spellcheck it. But he went ahead and published anyway, as did CBS, ESPN and others, to the shame of the sports journalism world. Once there were rumblings that Kekua might not exist, ESPN was chasing that story but, after an internal debate, the network held off while trying to get an interview with Te'o, according to The New York Times. The hope of access trumped the investigative reporting, so the hoax was exposed by the snarky but solid sports blog Deadspin. Watch: New York Post mocks Hillary's anger at Benghazi hearing . Lance Armstrong was another case study in deception and deceit. In the early years, as he won one Tour de France after another, virtually no one in the media wanted to mar the story line of the guy who overcame cancer and kept piling up championships. He said he never took banned substances -- wasn't that good enough? Didn't sportswriters hope to get the next Lance interview? Obviously the story line about drug use grew in recent years as former teammates hurled allegations, and U.S. anti-doping officials mounted an investigation that would wind up stripping Armstrong of his titles. Finally, of course, he went to Oprah Winfrey and said he'd been lying all along. Even so, some of his media defenders were less than outraged. Washington Post sportswriter Sally Jenkins told Charlie Rose that Armstrong had called her: . ""He said he was sorry for misleading me. He said he was sorry -- and this is a very small thing -- but he expressed that he was sorry that my reputation had taken a hit because of my association with him, which I appreciated. And it wasn't a very long conversation, but it was a meaningful one to me."" Watch: Paula Broadwell and media redemption . Jenkins said she wasn't mad at Armstrong and that ""that there's a level of anger at Lance that is out of proportion to the offense of doping."" I'm not feeling as charitable. I'm angry because Lance lied. As for the Penn State debacle, it's hard to deny that the worship of college football blinded the media to the notion that the sainted Joe Paterno might do anything wrong -- such as looking the other way after allegations that his assistant, Jerry Sandusky, was sexually abusing children. This sickening scandal unfolded under the nose of the sports media establishment until it was exposed by a local reporter, Sara Ganim of the Patriot-News in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. (Ganim now works at CNN.) We in the news business are accustomed to being misled and misinformed by politicians and their operatives. We've been through too many scandals to believe otherwise. And while we sometimes fall down on the job, we bring to the political arena a certain battle-hardened skepticism. Watch: Beyonce lip-synced -- oh well . The tradition has always been that sports is different, a kind of protected zone where athletes compete and no amount of spin can alter their performance on the field. Hero worship was baked into the cake, especially when covering local teams. If that was once true, it's hardly the case now in the era of steroids and strikes and lockouts and violence, as was sadly underscored when Jovan Belcher of the Kansas City Chiefs fatally shot his girlfriend and himself, and Bob Costas was skewered for talking about the NFL's gun culture. The notion that today's sports journalism can be anything other than aggressive and tough-minded is now as fictional as Manti Te'o's imaginary girlfriend. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","Manti Te'o saga is the latest of a series of embarrassing failures by journalists .

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- In a downtown Nairobi salon, tucked away in nondescript office building, women sit under hair dryers and gossip. They have their hair trimmed and their feet and hands pampered. Jackson Irungu is quitting Kenya after being targeted for being gay. But there is one patron that draws the eye. In his Bermuda shorts, orange shirt, and cravat, Jackson Irungu is getting a manicure. He is among a tiny minority of openly gay men in Kenya who face a constant barrage of verbal abuse on the street and even occasional physical attacks. ""We live in fear,"" says Irungu, ""There is a perception that being gay is wrong so it is a bit tricky being gay when you live in Kenya."" Irungu says a friend of his was beaten so badly outside a nightclub in Nairobi that he had to be taken to hospital. There is no way to corroborate such incidents with the police because homosexual Kenyans are just too afraid to report them. The law books help create the ambivalence. Two separate penal codes relate to the gays in Kenya and the archaic laws can lead to a 5 to 14 year jail term. They are rarely enforced, but penal code 162 and 165 are an effective threat hanging over the gay community. ""They have a weapon to which they defend themselves,"" says Pauline Kimani, a leader of an umbrella organization for gays in Kenya. She says that gay Kenyans are arrested on charges like 'loitering' and ""disturbing the peace.""  Watch report on treatment of gays in Kenya » . ""Ending the sodomy laws would be up to members of parliament,"" says Kenyan government spokesman Dr. Alfred Mutua, ""and they represent the people."" Gay rights is a non-starter for Kenyan politicians and attempts to repeal the laws have ended practically before they began. The Kenyans who elect the MPs are mostly on their side. A few people defend gay rights on the streets of Nairobi. But many say that gays shouldn't have rights, are ""un-African,"" and not good Christians. Kenya is a country of faithful people and religion plays a defining role in homophobia in Kenya. Seventy percent of the country is Christian and there is a sizeable Muslim and Hindu population. ""This is an abomination that is totally unacceptable by God who formed us not to function in that way,"" says Patrick Kuchio, a popular preacher at Parklands Pentecostal Church. More traditional denominations in Africa are also conservative, leading the charge to stop gay pastors from being ordained. Though the Pentecostal church made major inroads to Kenya only in the 1950s, many of its supporters, and other faithful in the continent, consider homosexuality a Western concept. ""Amongst traditional Kenyan people, it was unheard of,"" says Pastor Kuchio. He believes the practice must have been imported into Kenya. As a result, most homosexuals in the country have to hide their sexual preference for fear of social stigma, say gay activists in Kenya. ""They say, 'look, you are evil, the law also disagrees with you,'"" says Kimani, ""You are not supposed to exist within our community."" By their own admission, gay rights groups have been under funded and disorganized. But since forming an umbrella organization, their leaders say there is a slow thawing of attitudes towards gays in Kenya. Their monthly party now gets police protection. But mention something as fundamental as a gay pride march and it is met with laughs. It would be utterly inconceivable, they say. But for an openly gay man Kenyan like Irungu, progress is too slow in Kenya.","Gay Kenyans face verbal abuse and even physical attacks.

"Editor's note: Tomás R. Jiménez is an assistant professor of sociology at Stanford University and an Irvine Fellow at the New America Foundation. He is also author of the forthcoming book, ""Replenished Ethnicity: Mexican Americans, Immigration, and Identity"" (University of California Press). Tomás Jiménez says many Mexican-Americans are the children of U.S.-born parents. (CNN) -- Just about any celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month (September 15 - October 15) will highlight the diversity among Hispanics. They come from different parts of the Spanish-speaking world, have settled in various areas of the United States, have distinctive customs and come in all shapes and colors. But an often overlooked difference among Hispanics relates to how many generations back they trace their roots in U.S. history. Hispanics are not just immigrants or the U.S.-born children of immigrants. They are also Americans with deep family histories in the United States. This is especially true of the Mexican-origin population, the largest Hispanic subgroup and one that has been continually replenished by immigrant newcomers for a century. Truly knowing what it means to be a person of Mexican origin requires understanding the experiences of the nearly 3 in 10 (8.5 million) Mexican-Americans who were born in the United States to U.S.-born parents. These later-generation Mexican-Americans' experience in the United States, though rooted in a distant past, is nonetheless deeply affected by current and uninterrupted immigration from their ancestral homeland. In some ways, Mexican-Americans have lived what amounts to a classic tale of assimilation. They speak English (and no Spanish in the majority of cases), intermarry in large numbers, live in ethnically mixed neighborhoods, work in just about every imaginable profession, are honored on Memorial Day and Veterans Day, occupy important political positions and are highly patriotic. But ongoing Mexican immigration puts a twist on this classic assimilation tale, making ""Mexicanness"" relevant to later-generation Mexican-Americans in both problematic and enjoyable ways. It can be tough being a member of an ethnic group that is so synonymous with immigration. Even if their immigrant ancestors came early in the 20th century, continuous immigration means that Mexican-Americans are never safe from erroneous assumptions that they are foreigners. Surnames that end in ""ski"" or start with ""O'"" are woven into the fabric of American ethnic surnames. But ""García,"" ""Fernandez"" and ""Martínez"" remain bright threads that, combined with dark skin color, can make Mexican-Americans and other Hispanics seem foreign in the eyes of others. Ask the later-generation descendants of earlier waves of Mexican immigrants, and they'll tell you that ""Where are you from ... no, where are you really from?"" are questions that they have to field all too often. And even if it's clear that they are Mexican-Americans, they still get quizzed about how well they speak Spanish. Assumptions about them being foreign turn from annoying to downright scary when law enforcement personnel suspect them of being illegal immigrants. But continuous immigration also makes being Mexican-American enjoyable in some ways. While there is no shortage of people who see the growing Mexican-origin population with alarm, there are also plenty of people who see the growth as an opportunity. Corporations, retailers, political parties and churches are all trying to grab a slice of the ""Hispanic market,"" the overwhelming majority of which is Mexican. Retail marketing campaigns, sprinkles of the Spanish language in political speeches and Mexican-themed media are generally aimed at the immigrant audience. All of this attention adds cachet to Mexican ancestry that even later-generation individuals enjoy. We live in a time when America often celebrates its ethnic vibrancy. People who are cut off from an immigrant population of the same ethnic origin have a hard time finding ways to celebrate their roots in any significant way, and they often lament being ethnically bland. Mexican-Americans, in contrast, don't have to worry about ethnic blandness because the opportunities to celebrate their heritage are all around. Ongoing Mexican immigration means constant access to the food, language, traditions, popular culture and customs that makes being Mexican-American enjoyable. As we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month and recognize all of the diversity among Hispanics, it begs the question: How do we know what it means to be Hispanic? The answer can only be arrived at by appreciating the experiences of those Hispanics whose families have called the United States home for several generations and those who more recently have come to call this land their home. No matter how deep or shallow their roots extend into American history, what almost all Hispanics have in common is that immigration profoundly defines their experience. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tomás R. Jiménez.","Tomás Jiménez: Mexican-Americans often perceived only as immigrants .

"(CNN) -- Rapper T.I. walked out of a federal prison Thursday to return to an Atlanta halfway house where he will spend the last 14 days of an 11-month prison sentence for a parole violation, his lawyer said Thursday. T.I. was taken to the U.S. penitentiary in Atlanta two weeks ago when Bureau of Prisons officials cut short his furlough just a day after it started because they believed he violated his furlough agreement. When T.I. walked out of an Arkansas prison on August 31, he tweeted, ""The storm is over & da sun back out."" A cloud, however, quickly rained on the rapper's freedom parade. Prison documents obtained by CNN showed prison officials objected to his manager and a reality TV producer riding with him on a luxury bus on the trip from the Federal Correctional Center in Forrest City, Arkansas, to Georgia. They quickly removed him from the halfway house, where he had expected to spend the last month of his sentence, and relocated him to the Atlanta prison. Defense lawyer Steve Sadow pushed federal prison officials to reconsider, pointing out that the furlough agreement did not specifically state others could not ride with the popular hip-hop artist, whose real name is Clifford Harris Jr. ""We have good reason to believe that this favorable result was reached because of the proactive and assertive approach taken to protect T.I.'s rights by providing BOP (Bureau of Prisons) officials and the media with reliable and accurate information that T.I. did not intend to violate his transfer furlough or any other BOP rules en route from the prison facility in Arkansas to the halfway house in Atlanta,"" Sadow said Thursday. It was initially believed prison officials objected to his use of a luxury tour bus for the trip from Arkansas to Georgia, but the furlough agreement T.I. signed specified only that he would travel in a ""POV,"" a privately owned vehicle. He will leave the halfway house and begin a yearlong probation term on September 29, Sadow said. The rapper served two stints in the Arkansas prison. He was there for seven months in 2009 as part of a sentence negotiated two years ago to resolve federal gun charges. Those charges followed his attempt to buy three machine guns in the parking lot of an Atlanta grocery store. His latest time behind bars was triggered by his arrest, along with his wife, after a motorcycle officer stopped their car on Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California, a year ago. A police report said suspected drugs were found in the couple's car and they were both arrested on drug charges. The charge against the rapper was later dropped, but he failed a drug test given by his parole officer. CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report .","Prison official reverse their decision, let T.I. resume his furlough, lawyer says .

"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti -- Haitian election officials have rejected hip-hop singer Wyclef Jean's bid to run for president of the Caribbean nation. Jean's name was not on the list of 19 approved candidates released by Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council on Friday night. ""I respectfully accept the committee's final decision, and I urge my supporters to do the same,"" Jean said in a statement. In an interview with CNN shortly after the approved candidates' list was announced, Jean said he was surprised by the news. ""This has come to our party and to our group as a total shock,"" he said. Jean was among 15 prospective candidates rejected. Elections officials did not provide a reason to reporters, but Jean's statement said they had ruled he was not a resident of the country. ""I want to assure my countrymen that I will continue to work for Haiti's renewal; though the board has determined that I am not a resident of Haiti, home is where the heart is -- and my heart has and will always be in Haiti,"" Jean's statement said. ""This ruling just tells me that I can't officially seek the office of president."" On August 5, Jean announced on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" that he had submitted paperwork to run for president. Since then, his possible candidacy has met with some criticism. Haitian-American rapper Pras, who once performed alongside Jean and Lauryn Hill in the '90s group The Fugees, said he supported Jean's opponent. Actor Sean Penn, who has lived in Port-au-Prince for months since the earthquake helping displaced Haitians, also questioned whether the Haitian-born musician could make moves to lead the devastated nation. Jean's eligibility had been under question recently after claims that he had not lived in Haiti for five consecutive years before the election, a requirement in the nation's constitution. Jean's lawyer had said his client met that criteria. Earlier this week, Jean challenged media reports that he would not be eligible to run, but also entertained the possibility that he would be declared ineligible, telling CNN on Thursday that he would continue organizing Haiti's youth to push for education reform. ""Haiti's constitution says that all kids should have the privilege of a free education, and that's something we'll push for whether we make it or not,"" he said. Jean, who was born in Haiti, shot to fame in the mid-1990s as a member of The Fugees, a U.S.-based hip-hop and reggae group. He now performs as a solo artist. He has been an outspoken proponent of Haiti through his Yele Foundation, and was one of the first celebrities to offer aid after the devastating earthquake there in January.

"(Rolling Stone) -- Nicki Minaj is a purist's nightmare. She doesn't just straddle pop categories, she dumps them in a Cuisinart, whips them to a frothy purÃ©e, then trains a guided missile at the whole mess. She is a rapper's rapper, a master of flow and punch lines, with skills to please the most exacting gatekeepers of hip-hop street cred. But she's a bubblegum starlet as well, delivering confections to the nation's mall rats. ""I'm in the HOV lane,"" Minaj boasts on her second LP. It's true: She's one of the few performers who can rival Jay-Z's blend of artistic bona fides and sheer star power. But Minaj is also in the Gaga lane, the Bowie lane, the Missy Elliott and Gary Glitter and Katy Perry and Betty Boop lanes. (By the sound of ""Right by My Side"" -- a blustery duet with Chris Brown -- she can cruise in the Jordin Sparks lane, too.) Then there's the Roman Zolanski lane. ""Roman Reloaded"" opens with Minaj -- a biracial woman from Queens via Trinidad -- ranting in the voice of her (Polish?) homosexual ""twin brother"" alter ego. In the same song, she takes on the voice of Martha Zolanski, Roman's mother, singing in a cartoon Cockney accent. ""Take your medication, Roman,"" counsels Minaj/Martha. ""Quack, quack to a duck and a chicken, too/Put the hyena in a freakin' zoo,"" answers Minaj/ Roman. Later, she bursts into ""O Come, All Ye Faithful."" She's just limbering up. On ""Roman Reloaded,"" the energy never flags -- it's the rare filler-free mega-pop album, an achievement for a record that stretches to 19 songs and 69 minutes. Minaj fans dismayed by her post-""Super Bass"" turn toward pop will be cheered up by the red-meat hip-hop here. There's booming triumphalism (""Champion""), electro-rap boastfests (""Beez in the Trap"") and a couple of collaborations with her mentor Lil Wayne, in which she more than justifies the claim that ends the album: ""I am the female Weezy."" The beats, by young comers like Hit-Boy and Kenoe, are taut and lively, a good match for Minaj's manic spirit and comic zingers -- and comic anti- zingers. Here's Minaj on taking in fashion shows with ""Vogue"" editor-in-chief Anna Wintour: ""When I'm sittin' with Anna/ I'm really sittin' with Anna/ Ain't no metaphor punch line -- I'm really sittin' with Anna."" Beginning with Track 10, the thumping ""Starships,"" ""Roman Reloaded"" veers into radio pop, serving up club anthems, clobbering ballads and, on the Dr. Luke-produced ""Young Forever,"" the most shameless Rihanna-wanna-be song ever recorded, a tune worthy of the ambition. The album is neatly utilitarian and bifurcated -- ""Side One"" for the hip-hop headz, ""Side Two"" for teenyboppers. But why would you choose just one Nicki Minaj? With her, the point is plenitude: more boasts, more hooks, more craziness, more shape-shifting, more cognitive dissonance, more pleasure. If you believe that art and commerce and provocation and fun -- and hip- hop and disco and teen pop -- can all be one and the same, here's a record for you. Come, all ye faithful.

"(CNN) -- Rapper T.I. walked out of a federal prison in Arkansas Wednesday morning, 10 months after he began serving a sentence for violating his parole on a gun conviction, a prison official confirmed.

T.I., whose real name is Clifford Harris, wrote in a Twitter message Wednesday. T.I. will complete the last weeks of his 11-month sentence in a community service center, or half-way house, but Bureau of Prisons spokesman Chris Burke would not disclose its location until the singer gets there. This was the rapper's second stint in the Federal Correctional Center in Forrest City, Arkansas.  He served seven months there in 2009 as part of an unusual sentence negotiated two years ago to resolve federal gun charges. Those charges followed his attempt to buy three machine guns in the parking lot of an Atlanta grocery store. ""Feels great to be back where I belong... Back in the arms of those who need me the most,"" T.I. tweeted Wednesday. Cable channel VH-1 announced just hours after his release that it was producing a reality series to show T.I. ""as he re-adjusts to life as a free man after being incarcerated for nearly a year in a federal prison in Arkansas."" The as yet-untitled 10-episode series will premiere in December, VH-1 said. ""Viewers will get a behind-the-scenes look at the most private and personal moments of one of today's hottest, most sought after Grammy winning artists as he is reunited with his wife and kids and thrust back into society at this crucial juncture in his life,"" the channel said. MTV produced a series in 2009 based on the countdown to his first prison term, titled ""T.I.'s Road to Redemption."" His latest prison time was triggered by his arrest, along with his wife, after a motorcycle officer stopped their car on Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California, a year ago. A police report said suspected drugs were found in the couple's car and they were both arrested on drug charges.  While the charge against Harris was later dropped, he failed a drug test given by his parole officer. The cornerstone of the plea deal was his community service, which included the rapper speaking to young people about the importance of staying off drugs and out of trouble. At a federal parole violations hearing a month his arrest, Harris acknowledged that he had a drug addiction problem. ""I screwed up big time and I am sorry,"" Harris told U.S. District Judge Charles Pannell, Jr. ""I am sincerely sorry. I am scared that you will send me to prison."" ""Mr. Harris has had the limit of second chances,"" Pannell said as he imposed the 11-month sentence last October.

"(CNN) -- A panel of New York National Guard officers has recommended that an Iraq war veteran who acknowledged his homosexuality must leave the service, his supporters said Tuesday. First Lt. Dan Choi, shown at a gay protest rally in May in California, disclosed in March that he was gay. First Lt. Dan Choi disclosed in March that he is gay, challenging the 1994 ""don't ask, don't tell"" law that requires the military to discharge troops who disclose their sexual orientation. Tuesday's ruling, made after a daylong hearing, is a step toward stripping Choi of his officer's commission and ending his career. ""It's disappointing, but not unexpected,"" said Sue Fulton, a spokeswoman for Knights Out, a group of gay and lesbian West Point alumni Choi helped found. Fulton said the Guard's Federal Recognition Board heard from members of Choi's unit, his commanding officer and fellow soldiers who served in Iraq, and reviewed more than 150 letters of support for Choi, a 2003 West Point graduate and an Arab linguist. ""At the end of the day, they did not consider any of that material [to] whether he was a good soldier,"" she said. ""It was solely about whether he said he was gay."" The closed-door hearing began Tuesday morning before the board, which certifies that Guard officers meet the standards of the regular Army. Its decision came after several hours of deliberation Tuesday afternoon. The hearing is considered a confidential personnel matter, and the service won't comment on the results, said Lt. Col. Paul Fanning, a National Guard spokesman. The board's recommendation must be approved by the commander of the U.S. 1st Army, which oversees the National Guard and Army Reserve. But Choi's public declaration is ""a finding of fact that the board has to deal with,"" Fanning said. ""The Army has no choice but to follow through with that,"" he said. More than 12,500 gays have been forced to leave the military since ""don't ask, don't tell"" went into effect -- including dozens of Arabic speakers, people highly valued by the military since the invasion of Iraq. Choi transferred from the active-duty Army to the National Guard in June 2008, Fanning said. He served as an infantry platoon leader in Iraq in 2006 and 2007 and, like many soldiers, had his yearlong tour of duty extended by three months. Choi served as celebrity grand marshal of the San Francisco, California, Gay Pride Parade over the weekend. He told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Monday that he is acting on ""the lessons that I learned at West Point -- honesty and courage and integrity."" ""It's an informed decision,"" he said. ""But more important than the consequences, more important than punishments or those fears that we might have, we take courage and we take those things very seriously of the values that we were taught. And it's more important that we be honest with ourselves, we have integrity, and we have courage."" President Obama campaigned on a pledge to repeal ""don't ask, don't tell"" and has been criticized for not moving faster on that goal since taking office in January. He told gay-rights advocates at a Monday night reception at the White House that his administration is already working with House and Senate members to get the law changed. ""It's not for me to tell you to be patient any more than it was for others to counsel patience to African-Americans who were petitioning for equal rights a half-century ago,"" Obama said. But he added, ""I do have a responsibility to see that this change is administered in a practical -- and a way that takes over the long term."" Fulton said that while Obama can't change the law himself, he could sign an executive order halting discharges while the policy is under review.","First Lt.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- India and Pakistan traded bitter accusations Wednesday after New Delhi said Pakistani troops had killed two of its soldiers in the disputed territory of Kashmir, a flash point between the two nations since their creation. Indian Foreign Secretary Ranjan Mathai summoned the Pakistani High Commissioner and ""lodged a strong protest"" about what India alleges took place Tuesday, increasing the strain on ties between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. But Pakistan reiterated its denial of the accusations, saying India was trying to distract attention from a weekend clash in the Himalayan territory that left a Pakistani soldier dead. India asserts that Pakistani troops took advantage of thick fog in a wooded area on Tuesday to cross over to its side of the Line of Control, the de facto border between the two nations in Kashmir. The Indian military says one of its routine patrols spotted the Pakistani troops in the Mendhar sector of Poonch district, and a firefight lasting about 30 minutes ensued, during which two Indian soldiers were killed. The Indian government on Wednesday accused Pakistani troops of subjecting the two soldiers' bodies to ""barbaric and inhuman mutilation,"" calling the alleged actions ""highly provocative."" Read more: Fire destroys historic shrine, triggers anger in Kashmir . The Pakistani foreign ministry rejected the allegations that its troops had crossed the Line of Control and killed Indian soldiers. ""These are baseless and unfounded allegations,"" the foreign ministry said. ""Pakistan is prepared to hold investigations through the United Nations Military Observes Group for India and Pakistan on the recent cease-fire violations on the Line of Control."" Pakistan said it is committed to ""a constructive, sustained and result-oriented process of engagement with India,"" and is working to ensure their relations are normal. Indian External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid urged his compatriots to keep cool heads despite widespread outrage about the reported attack on the Indian soldiers. While noting ""enormous concern among ordinary people"" and a ""tremendous amount of stress"" in the government, he said Wednesday, ""I think it's important that we remain in control of the situation and we don't allow emotions to run away with the situation."" Speaking in an interview with CNN affiliate IBN, Khurshid said it was necessary to wait for Pakistan's formal response to India's diplomatic protest. In the Sunday clash, according to the Pakistani military, Indian troops crossed the Line of Control and attacked a military post. Pakistani army troops repulsed the attack, but one Pakistani soldier was killed and another critically injured, Pakistan said. The Indian Defense Ministry, however, said Pakistani troops opened fire unprovoked on Indian posts in the north Uri sector of Indian-administered Kashmir. Indian troops retaliated and forced Pakistani troops to stop firing, the ministry said. It did not immediately report the number of casualties. The disputed territory lies in India's Kashmir Valley, separated from Pakistan by the 450-mile Line of Control. The Pakistani army filed a formal complaint over Sunday's incident with United Nations military observers, said Kieran Dwyer, spokesman for the agency's peacekeeping operations. The U.N. group will conduct an investigation. No complaint had been filed by either army over Tuesday's incident. U.N. officials urged ""both sides to respect the cease-fire and de-escalate tensions through dialogue,"" Dwyer said. Read more: South Asian rivals take baby steps to warmer relations . The two South Asian neighbors have had a cease-fire along the de facto border since November 2003. But it has been violated repeatedly, with both sides accusing the other of offenses. Bilateral talks were suspended in 2008 after an attack by Pakistani militants in Mumbai, India's most populous city, killed more than 160 people. The negotiations have since resumed. Read more: 2 police officers killed in Kashmir attacks . The conflict over Kashmir dates back to 1947, after Britain relinquished control of the Indian subcontinent, giving birth to modern India and Pakistan. Kashmir was free to accede to either nation. Maharaja Hari Singh, the ruler of the kingdom at the time, initially chose to remain independent but eventually opted to join India, thereby handing key powers to the central government in New Delhi. In exchange, India guaranteed him military protection and vowed to hold a popular vote on the issue. Read more: Pakistani Taliban threaten to target India after execution of Mumbai attacker . The South Asian rivals have fought two full-scale wars over the territorial issue. Islamabad has always said that majority-Muslim Kashmir should have been a part of Pakistan. A United Nations resolution adopted after the first war called for a referendum allowing the people of Kashmir to choose which country they wanted to join, but that vote for self-determination has never been held. Pakistan wants that referendum to take place. India says that Pakistan lends support to separatist groups fighting against government control and argues that a 1972 agreement mandates a resolution to the Kashmir dispute through bilateral talks. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh reported from New Delhi, and journalist Habib Nasir reported from Islamabad, Pakistan.

"(CNN) -- ""The sequester is coming, the sequester is coming,"" cries Chicken Little, speaking of the across-the-board spending reductions set to kick in next Friday. As a result, much of the Washington establishment, politicians of both parties, and the media are bracing for the apocalypse. Henny Penny worries about poisoned meat going uninspected, the air traffic control system shutting down, and schools being forced to close. Meanwhile Turkey Lurkey is afraid that national security is threatened because our military will be gutted. And Foxy Loxy is concerned there will be massive job losses and our economy will crash. The reality, though, is that most of what we are being told about the sequester is just a fairy tale. Here's why: . The sequester imposes savage spending cuts . Actually, the sequester doesn't cut federal spending at all, or rather it cuts it only in the Washington sense of any reduction from projected baseline increases is a cut. In reality, even if the sequester goes through, the federal government will spend more every single year. In fact, in 2023 it will be spending $2.39 trillion more than it does today. OK, but at least the reductions in projected spending are big, right? Hardly. This year, the sequester would slow the growth in federal spending by just $85 billion, from an expected, pre-sequester budget of $3.64 trillion -- less than a 2.3% reduction. To put that in perspective, the federal government borrows $85 billion every 28 days . In fact, this actually overstates the size of this year's cuts. Because of ongoing contracts and the Byzantine labyrinth of federal budgeting, only $44 billion of that $85 billion will actually be cut from this year's budget. The rest will be cut in future years, but attributed to this year's budget. So, the real reduction in federal spending this year is just 1.2%. If the federal government can't reduce spending by less than a penny-and-a-half on the dollar without throwing us into the dark ages, something is truly wrong. But aren't the cuts larger for domestic discretionary spending? It is true that the cuts are not spread equally across all types of federal spending. Entitlement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security are generally exempt -- Grandma's Social Security check won't be cut -- meaning that discretionary spending takes a disproportionately larger hit. Still, we are talking about a reduction of less than 9%. That would leave domestic discretionary spending, after adjusting for inflation, at roughly the same level as 2009. You recall 2009, don't you? The starvation, the mass closure of our schools, the shutdown of the transportation system, the burning cities? What about defense? Surely, the sequester guts defense . Defense does take the biggest cut under sequester, nearly 13% of planned spending. In fact, defense spending would really be cut, in the sense of actually spending less, over the next two years. Still, it would never fall below the level of spending we had as recently as 2007, a year we managed to survive without al Qaeda wading ashore in Long Beach. Beginning in 2015, defense spending would start rising again, in real terms, and would exceed current levels by 2019. Keeping all this in perspective, over the entire 10-year period covered by the sequester, defense spending would average roughly $100 billion more each year (after adjusting for inflation) than we spent at the height of the cold war. I'm still worried about the impact on the economy. Some economists believe that the sequester will cost thousands of jobs and throw us into another recession. True or not? The proposed spending reductions amount to less than 0.03% of our gross domestic product. If our economy can't survive spending cuts of that size, we truly are Greece. Of course, in the short term, there will be some layoffs and furloughs. This will be hard on some communities that depend heavily on government spending, and even harder on those workers directly affected. However, most of the numbers cited about the numbers of jobs at risk come from industry groups with a vested interest in making the cuts look as bad as possible. This entire argument buys into the Keynesian conceit that government spending creates jobs over the long term. But the resources necessary to create those jobs have to be extracted from the private economy either through taxes or borrowing. That means the private sector then has fewer resources to invest in job creation. Given that the private sector generally puts those resources to a more productive use, it is likely that government spending destroys more jobs over the long run than it creates. We can and should have a legitimate debate about the best way to cut spending. But let's not be distracted by fairy tales about how the sky is falling. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael D. Tanner.","Michael Tanner: Most of what we are told about the sequester is just a fairy tale .
Tanner: Some think the sequester imposes savage spending cuts, but that's not true .
He says although defense spending will be cut, it would never fall below 2007 level .
Tanner: Government spending may destroy more jobs in the long run than it creates ."
"(CNN) -- The crew of a Japan Airlines Dreamliner loaded with 181 passengers apparently was unaware of fuel spewing from a wing as the jetliner prepared to thunder down the runway on Tuesday in Boston. It was only due to an alert from the pilot of another plane that Flight 7's takeoff for Tokyo was abandoned and the Boeing 787 towed to the gate, the second problem in two days for a JAL Dreamliner at Logan International Airport. An electrical fire on Monday damaged an empty Dreamliner on the same tarmac. The unusual twin incidents added to service questions about the highly touted plane that experienced a very difficult development and clearly has growing pains, according to safety experts. Boeing's chief project engineer for the 787 said in a conference call with reporters Wednesday that he is ""100 percent convinced the airplane is safe to fly."" ""There are issues we have seen that we will need to work through, and just like any new airplane program we work through those issues and we move on,"" said Mike Sinnett. The fuel leakage was due to an open valve, Japan Airlines spokeswoman Sze Hunn said Wednesday. The leak came from the left wing surge tank vent, Hunn said. ""Further inspection of the cockpit messages showed that one of four valves connecting the center tank and left main tank was opened and had resulted in fuel flowing from the center tank to the left main tank and subsequently into the surge tank near the wing tip and out the vent,"" Hunn said. ""The valve that the indicator showed was opened (the left outboard refuel valve), was deactivated/made inoperative and the flight was cleared to depart again,"" Hunn said in a statement. Air traffic control recordings from LiveATC.net captured Tuesday's incident as the the wide body was on the taxiway. ""Hey, that Japan Air may know it but they have fuel spewing out the leftward wing quite a bit,"" the pilot of another plane told the control tower, which radioed the JAL crew and halted takeoff. ""You mean fuel leak from left wing?"" came the response from the JAL cockpit, according to LiveATC.net. ""Yes ... there appears to be a fuel leak from your left wing,"" controllers said again. Airport fire and cleanup crews responded to the spill. The Federal Aviation Administration said it was investigating the matter, but the National Transportation Safety Board said it would not do so. More problems for Boeing's 787 Dreamliner . No safety board involvement indicated the reason behind the leak was probably determined quickly and remedied. The flight took off later in the day. It appears Monday's electrical fire that injured a firefighter was a more pressing issue for investigators, the manufacturer and the global airline industry that has embraced the 787 as a technologically advanced and efficient long-haul aircraft. Fire in the belly of the aircraft broke out not long after arriving in Boston from Tokyo. All of the 172 passengers and 11 crew had already disembarked. Boeing said in a statement that the fire was traced to a battery unit that helps power electrical systems when the engines are idle -- typically while a plane is being serviced or cleaned. The Dreamliner was being readied at the time for a return flight to Japan. The battery unit sustained severe fire damage, the safety board said, adding that it had sent two additional investigators to Boston. Japan's ministry of land and transportation ordered inspections of the same batteries in all Boeing 787s. So far, no irregularities have been found, but the results will be shared with U.S. authorities, the ministry said. United Airlines, a Dreamliner operator, inspected its six 787s following the Boston fire as a precaution, but would not comment further. Boeing said the fire appeared unrelated to previous problems involving 787 electrical power systems and that it was cooperating with the safety board. On Wednesday All Nippon Airways canceled a domestic flight in Japan because of an error message on the braking system of a 787. An airline official said it was not a mechanical problem, but a computer error on the electric brake system controls. Passengers on the flight were moved to a later flight and the computer part will be replaced, an ANA official said. In previous incidents, one of the 787 test flight aircraft lost primary electrical power in 2010 and was forced to make an emergency landing in Texas. All aboard evacuated safely. An engine failed during tests on the ground in South Carolina last July and inspectors found a similar problem on another aircraft in September. In December, another new 787 operated by United diverted safely to New Orleans after experiencing mechanical problems. Some safety experts are concerned, but not alarmed, about the mechanical setbacks with the Dreamliner since its delivery to airlines beginning in 2011, following years of manufacturing delays and cost overruns. They say new aircraft models often have ""growing pains."" Other experts have said any Dreamliner service problems would be magnified because of its problematic history during development. As the first commercial jetliner built mostly from lightweight carbon fiber, the twin-engine Dreamliner has been touted for fuel efficiency in an era of soaring fuel prices. It has attracted enormous interest from airlines, with most orders coming from overseas carriers initially. Boeing shares were off sharply on Wall Street relating to its Dreamliner problems this week.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A Kurdish student shot and killed his American teacher at a Christian school in the northern Iraqi city of Sulaimaniya, then turned the gun on himself, the local mayor said Thursday. Witnesses reported that the student and teacher had argued a few minutes before the shooting, Sulaimaniya Mayor Zana Mohammed Saleh told CNN. He said an investigation was still under way, but the attack did not appear to have any political motivation. Sulaimaniya is in Iraq's autonomous and relatively secure Kurdish region. In Baghdad, the U.S. Embassy said the American consulate in Erbil was trying to confirm the details and the identity of the victim. The shooting occurred at a campus of the Classical School of the Medes, a private, Christian, English-based network of schools operating in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq. Saleh said that after the student and teacher had argued, the student pulled a pistol and shot the teacher. Then he started screaming and shot himself, dying a few hours later at a local hospital. ""This is not a religious or political motivation behind this shooting. It's just another criminal incident,"" the mayor said. ""However, the investigation is still ongoing.""","The killing took place at a Christian school in northern Iraq .

"(CNN) -- More than 50,000 people in 2011 were arrested in New York City for possessing small amounts of marijuana -- the majority of whom were black and Latino -- at a considerable judicial and financial cost. New York City spends about $75 million every year on arresting people for recreational marijuana possession. But what many people don't know is that the state decriminalized this offense more than 30 years ago, making private possession of less than 25 grams of marijuana a violation punishable by a $100 fine. Possession of the same amount in public view remains a criminal misdemeanor. Despite this change in law, arrests for small quantities of marijuana over the last decade have skyrocketed, with more than 400,000 people arrested and unceremoniously run through the criminal justice system. Marijuana possession is now the No. 1 arrest category in New York. Why is this happening? Each year, hundreds of thousands of people in New York are stopped, questioned, frisked and searched, often without justification, under the ""stop and frisk"" policy. The vast majority of these people live in communities of color, and almost 90% are immediately released without arrest or even a summons. Often, however, the police approach young people and instruct them to empty their pockets immediately and show the officers anything they have. People who have a small quantity of marijuana in their pockets take it out and hold it up. The marijuana is now in public view. Thousands of people are then arrested and charged with misdemeanor possession, punishable by up to three months in jail and a $500 fine. Given the change of law in 1977, had the marijuana remained in the person's pocket, possession would not have been a crime at all. But in complying with a police officer's request, otherwise noncriminal behavior is instantly transformed into an arrest and unceremonious journey through the criminal justice system. This is fundamentally unfair. Many view it as classic entrapment. A majority of these arrests happen only in certain neighborhoods. Indeed, compounding the injustice is the fact that 85% of the people arrested are black and Latino. Yet studies consistently show that younger and affluent whites use marijuana in equal if not greater numbers. The consequences of an arrest are severe, especially for young people of color who are already disproportionately subjected to criminal justice system intervention and incarceration. An arrest creates serious barriers to going to college or getting a job, and that person's future may begin to spiral downward. The damage to police and community relations cannot be overstated. Another serious problem is that these needless and inappropriate arrests detract from arresting and prosecuting serious criminals. Millions of dollars in law enforcement resources are wasted. Thousands of lives are damaged with the contamination of having a criminal record. But New York is prepared to take a significant step forward to solve this problem. With the leadership of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, we are on the brink of finishing the job that the state Legislature started in 1977. We want to reduce the classification of possession of small quantities of marijuana in plain view from a misdemeanor to a violation. Justice demands this change. The possession of small quantities of marijuana is either a crime or it is not. But it cannot be criminal activity for one group of people and socially acceptable behavior for another when the dividing line is race. The connected and powerful -- including many in high political office -- have frequently admitted to smoking marijuana when they were young. We didn't unmercifully penalize them. We should stop needlessly criminalizing tens of thousands of our young people for doing the same thing. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hakeem Jeffries.","In 2011, 50,000 mostly black and Latino people arrested in New York for having a little pot .

"(CNN) -- Islamist militants had been saving one last blow to deal to France after its military conducted a bloody, unsuccessful hostage rescue attempt in Somalia Friday. Al-Shabaab declared Wednesday that it has killed the hostage. In the war of words, it was important to the militia to announce the killing occurred not during but after the raid -- as retribution for it. Read more: 2 French soldiers likely killed in failed hostage rescue, defense minister says . The French defense ministry has said it believed the militant group killed military agent Denis Allex during Friday's intense firefight thus thwarting the operation's objective on the spot. The al Qaeda affiliate claimed soon after the raid that it had moved Allex unharmed to a new location and would decide his fate shortly afterward in light of France's deadly military operation. Read more: U.S. supported France's failed hostage rescue in Somalia . Allex was an agent of the DGSE, France's equivalent of the CIA and a part of its defense ministry. In the long statement on its decision to take his life, al-Shabaab accused the French soldiers of killing Muslims in military operations abroad and mistreating them at home. It mentioned France's current role in Mali, where 1,700 troops are to join forces with neighboring African countries to rout out an Islamist occupation of the country's north. All of this in sum warranted Allex' killing as an act of vengeance, al-Shabaab said. Read more: French bid to rescue hostage in Somalia fails, leading to soldier's death . At least 17 al-Shabaab fighters and two French soldiers died in Friday's mission in the village of Bulo-Marer, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) northwest of Mogadishu. The French defense ministry originally reported one of the two soldiers as missing, but al-Shabaab later posted a photo of his purported corpse to its Twitter feed, saying he had died of wounds suffered during the heated battle that ensued during Friday's operation. Allex was abducted on July 14, 2009, while on a mission in Mogadishu in support of the transitional Somali government, the French Defense Ministry said. French media reports suggest that Denis Allex is a pseudonym for the military serviceman. French officials said they launched the rescue attempt after the terror group failed to negotiate for the hostage's release for years while holding him in inhumane conditions. On Monday, French Defense Dinister Jean-Yves le Drian said the failure of the rescue mission was ""extremely regrettable.""

"(CNN) -- The Iraq War ended in December, and veterans and other citizens throughout the country have begun clamoring for local parades to celebrate the return of our Iraq veterans -- yet only one city in the nation, St. Louis, has held one. In New York, which this week hosted a ticker-tape parade for the New York Giants after they won the Super Bowl, Mayor Michael Bloomberg has said he will hold off on a celebration for Iraq veterans, as the Department of Defense has suggested, because he agrees the time is not right. And President Obama has yet to call for broader ceremonies besides a small state dinner to be held later this month for only 200 Iraq veterans. The question of whether we should commemorate our Iraq veterans is controversial in a way that it shouldn't be. This isn't about claiming ""mission accomplished"" prematurely. The troops are finally home, and Americans across the political spectrum ought to recognize and celebrate their service. As an Iraq War veteran, I can tell you: This isn't about glorification. Nobody joined the military so they'd one day get to walk under a hail of confetti. But a commemoration isn't about that; it's about validating the morally and politically difficult task of serving your country in war. While most veterans will tell you about receiving hearty thank-yous from strangers or a spontaneous round of applause every now and then, what they seldom mention are the people who feel compelled to qualify their appreciation by noting that they opposed the war. It's time for that to end. Less than 1% of this country has served in Iraq or Afghanistan, and this has created a civil-military divide that has alienated and isolated this generation of veterans. It has tangible consequences across issues of mental health, employment and education. Our government has expanded on the best public policy program of the last century by creating the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Yet some veterans struggle to use the program because of the challenge of attending class alongside students with little understanding of the experiences they've faced. With new veterans facing 12% unemployment last year, an epidemic of suicides, and the legacy costs of war, we not only need this country's unreserved support -- we need its sacrifice. Americans need to hire our veterans, invest in their education, and expand on services that will help them heal from the scars of war. Instead, we risk repeating our society's Vietnam-era mistake of marginalizing and ignoring returning service members. Already there's been a grass-roots effort in St. Louis to turn this around. On January 28, two civilians got on Facebook and organized a parade there that drew 100,000 supporters and 20,000 veterans from throughout the country. More importantly, though, the event was bookended by a resource fair for veterans. My organization, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, was one of those providing employment, health and education resources to veterans after the parade. This kind of on-the-ground resource is important, because while the federal government has a critical role to play in funding services to veterans, it's in the cities and local communities that veterans actually are administered the support they need. For example, San Francisco has created a 311 line that connects veterans with local services to give them resources beyond what the Veterans Administration can provide alone. That's why the decision of the mayor of one of the greatest cities in the world not to be at the forefront of these efforts is so disappointing. Mayor Bloomberg, we exercised leadership overseas -- why can't you do the same thing at home? To the argument that holding parades while we're fighting in Afghanistan would be premature, I say consider this: In 2002, the first of this generation of veterans left the military behind to rejoin their civilian counterparts. Since that time, the number has swelled to more than a million. We can't afford to wait for these wars to end to start taking care of those that fought in them. These two wars are inexorably intertwined in the American consciousness, but for many, they remain separate. When the last troops return from Afghanistan in a few years, the Iraq War will be a distant memory. For those who served, there will never be closure, but there can be reconciliation. I know firsthand, having protested the Iraq War and then served in it, how complicated the politics of the last decade were. But this isn't about a war overseas; it's about a struggle here at home to take care of this generation's veterans, that we'll carry with us into old age. As a country, we're at a critical point where our approach to this generation of veterans will define whether we become the Next Greatest Generation or simply forgotten veterans of a forgotten war. I've seen the tremendous accomplishments of my fellow veterans overseas when we all worked together. Now it's time to do the same thing here at home. Will you have our backs?

"Washington (CNN) -- A winter storm slammed the East Coast all the way from Maine down to D.C., leaving massive drifts of snow and skull-cracking cold. Power grids collapsed. Citizens wrapped themselves in layers of fleece like the townsfolk from ""Dr. Zhivago."" Yet inside the Capitol, an unusual spirit of warmth greeted President Barack Obama's third State of the Union address. The still recent shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords prompted dozens of members to cross the aisle and sit among political foes in a show of solidarity. Some 43 million people tuned in on TV to hear the president lay out his assessments, hopes and dreams about how we could or would pull the nation out of its economic deep freeze. In a far-ranging speech, he did just that: Talking up some of his signature items, such as clean energy, education, and health care. He also addressed growing concerns about the need for tax reform, deficit control, and of course foreign affairs. So how much of it heated up and moved forward, and how much remains on ice a year later? Health care/IRS regulations . Republicans have never liked the president's health care reform plans. No secret there. So he invited them to tell him how it should be changed, and just to get the ball rolling, he made a proposal of his own: . ""If you have ideas about how to improve this law by making care better or more affordable,"" Obama said, ""I am eager to work with you. We can start right now by correcting a flaw in the legislation that has placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small business."" He was talking about a requirement that forced companies to expand their reporting to the Internal Revenue Service. It was a measure that pretty much everyone thought was wasteful and annoying, so Democrats and Republicans climbed on board, passing a bill to remove the regulation. The president signed it in April, making that a proposal accepted and a PROMISE KEPT. Health care/malpractice . The president made it clear that he will not go along with broad GOP designs to dismantle health care reform. ""Still,"" he said, ""I am willing to look at other ideas to bring down costs, including one that Republicans suggested last year: Medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits."" The Congressional Budget Office has analyzed the impact of this idea and estimated that it would reduce the cost of care to the government in programs like Medicaid and Medicare, and in turn that would reduce deficits by about $50 billion over the next nine or 10 years. But the legislation to make this happen got tangled up in bigger debates, and went nowhere. This one is not entirely dead, but it is certainly STALLED. Oil company tax breaks . Rising gas prices, oil company profits, and the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico had many voters on the warpath, a circumstance not missed by Obama. ""I'm asking Congress to eliminate the billions in taxpayer dollars we currently give to oil companies."" But just because you ask does not mean you will receive, especially in D.C. In May, the Senate considered a Democrat-sponsored bill to cut oil company tax breaks by $2 billion annually. A few Democrats joined the Republican opposition; a couple of Republicans helped the Democrats, but in the end it failed by four votes. So, adjusted for inflation, oil companies continue to enjoy $4.4 billion in tax breaks annually. Last year was the first ever that the average price of a gallon of gas never went below $3. Our cars are still running, but like an old DeSoto, this idea STALLED. Earmarks . The president drew a few lines in the sand, and this was one of them. ""If a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside, I will veto it."" True to his word, he has not signed any bills since containing earmarks -- at least, none we can find. He did not veto any either, however, because they never came his way. The Senate Appropriations Committee declared an earmark moratorium; not just because of the veto threat, but also because the House said it would not approve any bills with earmarks. In any case, the president has often straddled this fence: He has been a sharp critic of earmarks but he also hassigned bills containing multiple pet projects, including a spending bill in 2009 that had almost $8 billion worth. So we'll have to say circumstances left this proposal a PROMISE KEPT, though only on a technicality. Tuition tax credit . The cost of higher education jumped last year for many families, up as much as 20% in several states. Many local governments are in such economic straits that they can't help much, so the president turned to the legislative branch. ""I ask Congress to go further, and make permanent our tuition tax credit worth $10,000 for four years of college."" That did not come close to happening. Legislation extending the tuition tax credit did not even make it to the floor in either house of Congress. Proponents say that could change, however, since that temporary tax credit will expire at the end of this year increasing the political pressure for some kind of action. But for the moment, the idea is STALLED. Iraq . More than eight years after the U.S. and coalition forces invaded Iraq, with thousands of U.S. lives lost and enormous sacrifice on the part of our military and their families, Obama told the American people that their troops were coming home. ""This year, our civilians will forge a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people, while we finish the job of bringing our troops out of Iraq."" By the end of the year, the president had kept his word. The last U.S. troops crossed the Iraq border in December, marking the end of military combat operations. PROMISE KEPT. Afghanistan . This one is trickier. ""This year, we will work with nearly 50 countries to begin a transition to an Afghan lead,"" the president said, ""and this July, we will begin to bring our troops home."" Some troops have started coming home, true; so if you focus on only that narrow statement, you have to give the president credit. But there is a bigger picture that many critics insist must be considered. Right before Obama took office, 32,500 American troops were in Afghanistan. However, he approved two troop surges which doubled our military presence there. So by the time we vote for president again this fall, just under 70,000 will still be fighting among the poppy fields. For that reason, we have to call this pledge a WORK IN PROGRESS. Transparency . This White House has promised from the start to be more open, more transparent about the way it does business, than any that we've seen before. For the tweeting president, that meant cueing the tech talk about a special new program in the West Wing. ""Because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollars are being spent, you'll be able to go to a website and get that information for the very first time in history."" The administration lit up the Federal Taxpayer Receipt project in April, on tax day. It can be found at whitehouse.gov under the taxes section, and you can indeed get a breakdown on where your tax dollars go. PROMISE KEPT. Reorganizing government . One of the chief planks in the president's campaign platform was a promise to change the way Washington does business, and in his last State of the Union, he got specific. ""In the coming months, my administration will develop a proposal to merge, consolidate, and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America."" He did it, in the sense that after almost an entire year, he finally unveiled what he had in mind: combining six departments and agencies, all related to business, investments, or trade. It is a reorganization, but not nearly as broad as many of his critics expected, or arguably as robust as what he hinted was coming. This is a judgment call, but because of the timing and limited scope of what he finally came up, we will say this seems a WORK IN PROGRESS at best. Bipartisanship . The president promised from the very start that he was the man who could get everyone to work together. He echoed that theme several times in his State of the Union in 2011, but with the 2012 address upon us, the two parties seem perhaps more deeply divided than ever before. You can't say that's all his fault, but it is absolutely an idea that has STALLED in a big way.","Promises kept on Iraq withdrawal, reducing reporting burden in health care law .

"(CNN) -- During his 2010 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama made headlines by directly criticizing the Supreme Court for its decision in Citizens United v. FEC, the political funding case. He said Citizens United would ""open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections."" Certainly the decision has made it much easier for corporations and unions to directly spend unlimited sums of money in support of their favored candidates. One wonders, however, whether Obama realized at the time how much his own political allies, and therefore his own re-election effort, might benefit from Citizens United. This is nowhere more likely to be true than in Ohio, and the one thing that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree upon is that the path to victory for both parties in November runs through the Buckeye State. The first real hint of how Citizens United might benefit Obama in Ohio came in the weeks leading up to the recent primary in a Pennsylvania congressional district that borders Ohio. As a result of redistricting, the Democratic primary in Pennsylvania's 12th District, which runs southeast from the Ohio border beginning just north of Pittsburgh, pitted two incumbent members of Congress against one another. Organized labor was determined to punish one of the Democrats, Jason Altmire, for voting against the Affordable Care Act. Toward this end, the Workers' Voice Super PAC, formed by the AFL-CIO, funded an independent campaign operation for their endorsed candidate, Mark Critz. With the union's help, Critz, a first-term member of Congress who had been elected in a 2010 special election to fill the unexpired term of late John Murtha, was able to eke out an upset win over the initially favored Altmire. What is really interesting about what happened in this Pennsylvania race, however, is that the AFL-CIO referred to what it was doing as a kind of ""trial run"" for the general election. Almost all of the commentary on the Citizens United case has focused on conservative groups funding Republican candidates. But Citizens United also freed up unions to spend unlimited amounts of their money to directly advocate for the election of labor-friendly candidates, usually Democrats. Whereas conservative leaning groups have so far mainly used their money to fund campaign advertising, the AFL-CIO and other unions have made it clear that their money will be spent on grassroots get-out-the-vote activities. This is what they did in Pennsylvania. Just imagine what this might mean in the general election in Ohio. Mitt Romney will likely face two separate yet well-funded and well-organized ground operations knocking on doors throughout the state. The Obama team's 2008 get-out-the-vote operations were tremendously effective. This year, however, organized labor will be able to open up their treasuries to fund their own parallel operations. This is not to say that the pro-Romney groups will be silent. Super PACs backing Romney demonstrated during the Republican primary that they could raise seemingly endless amounts of cash and spend it effectively to drive down support for their opponents. The AFL-CIO's own political director told the Los Angeles Times that he expects labor to be outspent 20 to 1. Still, beyond religious groups and perhaps the tea party groups, Republicans do not really have any freestanding organizations upon which to piggyback their door-to-door efforts. This is significant because recent polls indicate the margins in Ohio and in fact all of the swing states are razor thin this year. In close races, turnout is everything. One of the reasons that Karl Rove was so successful in making sure that his boss, George W. Bush, was successful in the Buckeye state in 2000 and 2004 was that he understood the importance of an aggressive and well-organized get-out-the-vote plan, especially in the crucial 72 hours leading up to Election Day. It is an open question, however, whether Rove's 72-hour task force would still be as successful in Ohio in a post-Citizens United world, where the unions have much better funding opportunities and are freed from long-standing restraints on contacting nonmembers. Beyond religious groups, whose role should nevertheless not be underestimated, Republicans do not really have any freestanding organizations upon which to piggyback their door-to-door efforts. Moreover, in Ohio, unions have something else that is working in their favor. Last year, organized labor worked furiously to place a measure on the ballot repealing a bill signed into law by by Republican Gov. John Kasich restricting the bargaining rights of public employees.Â  They ended up gathering more than three times the signatures necessary, and when Election Day rolled around, 62% of voters cast their ballots in favor of the union position. Â . The names and addresses gathered, contacts made, and skills learned during that campaign will be available to groups like Workers' Voice in 2012. Of course, this does not mean that Obama is a shoo-in to win Ohio or the election in November. It does suggest, however, that regardless of what the national head-to-head polls say, Romney will need more than television commercials and mailings to win in Ohio. He will also need a grassroots get-out-the-vote strategy that outperforms even the plans of Rove. So far, the team that Romney has in place has not demonstrated that they grasp the importance of this type of work. It may be telling that when Obama kicked off his re-election campaign at Ohio State University on Saturday, he emphasized that he would win the race ""door by door, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood."" He said this secure in the knowledge that organized labor will have thousands of volunteers who are willing and, thanks to Citizens United, able to be on the ground rustling up every last vote for him. So, if Obama has the opportunity to give another State of the Union address in February of 2013, he might just want to look down at the justices sitting in the front row and, instead of criticizing them, give them a little wink.

"(CNN) -- For women who have already seen combat, it is a decision that is well overdue. But for the skeptics, it is a setback that will damage the military. The Pentagon's reported decision to lift the ban on women in combat units will take time to put into effect, but many former service members are lauding reports that the Defense Department will make the change soon. ""We have an all-volunteer force, and I think that this opens up a pool of folks who could serve in these positions,"" said Rep. Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran who lost both legs and the use of one arm when her helicopter crew was shot down in 2004. ""Any time that we've opened up our military to performance-based service ... we've benefited as a military. This is good for the nation."" The new policy will be implemented over the next three years, and some units may apply for exemptions, a senior defense official told CNN. Many readers doubt wisdom of decision . Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, said the military should open up every unit to women and see if they can complete the required training. ""If the women can't meet the standards, they don't get to graduate from the program."" U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a Hawaii Democrat who served with her state's National Guard in Iraq, said the move is a ""major step that is long overdue."" Interviewed by CNN's Soledad O'Brien, Gabbard said it's a ""great recognition ... of all the women who are currently serving overseas, many of them in these combat type situations already."" Gabbard was asked whether the move is merely semantics because front lines are constantly shifting and disappearing in today's world, and women already have been in combat situations. ""I think so,"" Gabbard said. ""When we look at, for example, two women, the first two women who earned Silver Stars since World War II, one was a military police sergeant, another was a medic. And they both were operating on the front lines per se, under fire, under extreme duress, shoulder to shoulder with their male and female counterparts, and exhibiting great courage and heroism and saving the lives of their brothers and sisters."" Julie Weckerlein, who has served more than 13 years in the Air Force and did tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, thinks the change reflects the military catching up with the times. Some women have already gone on patrols with ground troops, helping to talk with female civilians in Afghanistan. Some submarine crews have added female officers. Women also serve as military police officers. Join the discussion on Twitter . Women supporting supply missions have been drawn into battle in Iraq and Afghanistan, where there are no physical front lines. Now, Weckerlein said, ""people will be able to serve in the career fields they are qualified for, and they won't be turned away because of their gender."" Weckerlein went to Iraq in May 2007 as part of then-President George W. Bush's ""surge policy"" to put more troops on the ground. ""The first death I experienced was a woman, within the first few weeks I was in Iraq,"" she said. It was June 25, 2007, and her outpost in Nasir Lafitah came under mortar fire. In the attack, Army Staff Sgt. Trista Moretti of South Plainfield, New Jersey, was killed. Moretti, 27, was assigned to a support battalion. Days later, Weckerlein came under mortar fire again. This time, her comrade -- a cameraman -- was injured. Even though her deployment orders said Qatar, she spent weeks in the summer of 2007 shuttling between bases in Iraq and Afghanistan. Like many women in the military, Weckerlein didn't get the additional combat training because she was in what was considered a support role. ""I really want to stress there was no bitterness. It was a reflection of the times, and I feel like we are now getting with the times,"" she said. ""I see this as a positive thing."" Join the discussion on Facebook . Not everyone agrees. Rep. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, has said he doesn't think women are physically capable of combat duty. ""To have women serving in infantry ... could impair the mission essential task of those units, and that's been proven in study after study,"" he told radio host Laura Ingraham this month. ""It's nature -- upper body strength and physical movements and speed and endurance and so forth."" Jonn Lilyea, one of the founders of the military blog ""This Ain't Hell,"" wrote that he thinks it was an ""ill-considered decision."" Lilyea, a former sergeant who fought in Desert Storm, wrote that he is opposed to women in combat units, not because women are a distraction but because he thinks the Army and other services will be required to accept more women than are qualified or can be trained. ""If we're doing this to make the military better, fine, but if we're doing it just to beat our collective chest and show how just we are, then that's how a lot of body bags are going to get filled,"" he wrote. Twitter thread: Military to open combat jobs to women . Kayla Williams, author of the memoir ""Love My Rifle More Than You: Young and Female in the U.S. Army,"" said she thought most of the enlisted men would accept women into combat units. ""They will do their jobs, they will be professional, perhaps a few will be disgruntled,"" she said. ""Troops grumble, that's what we do, but many of them have already served along with women."" Williams, who saw combat while with the 101st Airborne, said she thought some branches of the military would ask for exceptions to the policy, and that was hard to argue with. ""Let's take this step and let women keep proving what they have already proved before,"" she said. Sgt. 1st Class Stephanie Cazares with the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division, at Fort Bliss, Texas, said it was impossible to know what, if any, changes it would mean for women in the military. ""It's not just put females in combat (specialties) and let's call it a day,"" she said. A number of issues, including safety regulations and cohabitation, will need to be addressed, she said. Army Staff Sgt. Stacey Zinda said that, like Cazares, she wasn't surprised by the news. Troops have speculated about the issue for a while, but Zinda, who is a career counselor, said she has yet to have a female soldier approach her about joining a combat unit. By the numbers: Women in the U.S. military . Gabbard was asked about a newspaper column that argued there would be times someone would be forced to be naked in front of the opposite sex, and that would be distracting, awkward, uncomfortable and potentially traumatizing. Does the writer have a point? ""I respectfully disagree. I think that in these situations we're talking about highly trained professionals, people who build our strong military because they place the mission first and they're there to fight as a member of a team. All of the other things that differentiate us, make us unique, whether it be gender or race or religion, all of these things fall aside when you're there putting the mission first and selflessly serving as that member of a team,"" Gabbard said. ""I can tell you from my own firsthand experience as well as the many, many people I've had the honor of serving with, whether in training or in a deployed setting, those things are not what's crossing your mind when you're operating."" Chuck Hagel, President Obama's nominee for defense secretary, didn't comment on the issue. He was asked for his reaction after he left a meeting at the Senate on Wednesday. ""We've got a hearing I'm looking forward to next week,"" he said, suggesting he may confront the matter then. What do you think about women in combat? Share your thoughts on iReport. We especially would like to hear from women.

"(Mashable)  -- Twitter's number of monthly unique visitors finally surpassed that of MySpace in August. Though it ranked third among social networking sites, Twitter ranked #50 in the list of top 50 properties overall. The numbers were crunched by the marketing research firm comScore. Twitter's lead over MySpace was marginal -- 96 million versus 95 million -- but the trend over time paints a prettier picture of the microblogging service. Between August 2009 and August 2010, Twitter grew 76 percent while MySpace dropped 17 percent. It's apples and oranges, though. Twitter is now a social publishing and news discussion platform more than anything, and MySpace is attempting to position itself as a destination for young people to discover new music, movies and games. Both appeal to brands that want to reach new people, but they're very different tools for very different kinds of brands. Both sites look quite small next to Facebook, which reached 598 million monthly uniques in the same month. It grew 54% over the past year. The second most popular social network, Windows Live, managed 140 million uniques, putting it closer to Twitter than to Facebook. Twitter has been moving quickly to capitalize on this growth. First it announced a new version of the front page that will make it easier to access photos, videos and other information without using other websites or programs. Many of Twitter's users rarely visit the website at all; they instead use desktop software or third-party interfaces on other websites to access their tweets. For that reason, Twitter's actual reach might be higher than the numbers from comScore imply. A revamped website could lead people to use Twitter.com instead of whatever they're using right now however, increasing the number of unique visitors the site receives now and in the future. Twitter already cashed in on its numerous users with Promoted Tweets, and now it will reach out to businesses with the ""Promoted Accounts"" system, which allows companies to buy visibility among their target market's ""Who to Follow"" suggestions. © 2011 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- A powerful storm is making its way through the northeastern U.S., expected to dump 2 feet of snow or more in some areas. This weekend will be another test of how accurate those forecasts are. Weather forecasts are much more accurate today than decades ago, but they are still not perfect. There are two big hurdles to overcome. One is creating accurate mathematical descriptions of the dynamics of the atmosphere. Two is increasing the resolution of the weather model. There are many features of the atmosphere that interact in complex ways. For example, the microphysics of clouds is very hard to describe mathematically, and varies for different types of clouds. There are internal gravity waves, which propagate continuously through the atmosphere with significant energy and have the capability of driving, or slowing, strong winds. The atmosphere includes general circulations that are affected by each other, and by the dynamics of the ocean and rotation of the earth. Depending on the temperature, pressure and humidity of the air, clouds will form and eventually result in rain. Any anomaly can change the entire system. (Just think of the Butterfly Effect, in which a small change such as a butterfly flapping its wings can affect something bigger, like a bird flying by, which can affect something even bigger, like an airplane, until a storm is formed.) Once we find that anomaly, we can track it because we know how the surrounding circulations can affect it. By the numbers: Northeast blizzard . We predict the weather by putting all the observations we have on winds, temperatures, pressures and other variables into a mathematical model that estimates how these systems will interact. Unfortunately, the earth's circumference at the equator is almost 25,000 miles, so when we try to model the entire earth, and go up into the mesosphere (about 25 to 50 miles above the earth) the picture gets fuzzier. Meteorologists can tell you, about five days out, with fair certainty what the weather will be like in your city or town.But it's nearly impossible to accurately model strong weather systems such as big storms or hurricanes, which include various cloud systems. In 2011, some residents in Staten Island, New York, evacuated from their homes before Hurricane Irene approached, but Irene took another path and the evacuation turned out to be unnecessary. The mathematical model wasn't wrong, but it couldn't know with absolute certainty the pathway of Irene. In 2010, a big winter storm was predicted for Utah. Many schools in the state canceled classes. The storm turned out not to be not so bad. This may be partly due to the effect of small, unresolved variations in the atmosphere, such as internal waves, that weakened the storm. Staying safe when the lights go out . Although miscalculations occur, they are not particularly common, especially over the past decade. We have a much better understanding of the dynamics of the atmosphere, more observations from towers, balloons and radar, and faster computers with much more processing speed and memory. Weather forecasting models are continually improving. Meteorologists are expected to know everything that is happening around the earth and tens of miles into the atmosphere. That's more space than we can even fathom. And all of the systems within that space affect each other. Think of it this way: A meteorologist's job is equivalent to guessing when a flashmob is going to break out. At the outset, it seems impossible. But if you meet every person in your city, get to know each of their general habits, and keep track of everyone's plans, you could guess when they might break out into song and dance as a group. We now know more about all of the systems in the atmosphere, how they affect each other and how they interact. There can still be anomalies, like that out-of-towner, but overall we have a pretty good idea what is going to happen and when. And if an anomaly occurs, how it will affect the entire system. We tease meteorologists about being wrong when they can't predict the weather to the exact detail, but their job is much harder than most people understand. Just try to remember that the next time you have to shovel yourself out of that unexpected extra 6 inches of snow. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julie Crockett.","A powerful storm is making its way through the Northeast .

"(CNN)  -- What do they have to be ashamed of? Several years ago, I caught one of my kids sneaking out of the house. Like any mom, I was more than a little mad and demanded an explanation. ""But Mom, I wasn't doing anything wrong -- I was just hanging out with my friends,"" was the response I got, but I knew better. The truth is that if you don't have anything to be ashamed of, you have no reason to be sneaking around. This election season, special interests are sneaking around trying to influence voters by funding the attack ads you see on TV. With the help of a recent court ruling, they can do it all anonymously. It's hard not to think it's because they have something to be ashamed of. In January, the Supreme Court gave corporations, unions and special interest groups the power to influence elections in an unlimited and anonymous way.  In an unprecedented move, the court, the same majority who decried an activist court when they were nominees, legislated from the bench and overturned years of previous case law, striking down longstanding limitations on campaign spending from special interests in the case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. Before Citizens United, corporations and unions could not spend money to run ads expressly advocating one candidate over another. Now they can. But what is worse, they can anonymously donate millions of dollars to ""nonprofit"" groups, which buy the ads without having to disclose who truly paid for them. The ruling essentially opened the barn door to anonymous, unlimited corporate donations to sway voters. Americans have a lot to be frustrated about right now with our economy, and I know many are anxiously awaiting their opportunity to weigh in on the country's future by voting on November 2. The idea that special interests are trying to secretly buy this election should make their blood boil. Although every member of Congress should be trying to stop this, that is not the case. Republicans have blocked legislation that would help bring these donors to light. A bill offered by Sen. Chuck Schumer, which I co-sponsored, would have forced corporations and unions that want to spend money on campaign ads to be transparent with the public about their political contributions and their donors, while also banning political spending from foreign entities. But each time the bill has received a vote, Republicans have made sure it failed. This bill wouldn't favor one side or the other: From the most conservative groups to the most liberal, any special interest group spending money on campaign ads would have to be honest about where their funding comes from so voters know whose interest they really represent. Republicans spend a lot of time decrying activist court decisions, yet when it comes to overturning campaign limits and disclosure rules for special interests, they seem to have changed their minds. The reality is that special interests are trying to buy our government this cycle, and Republicans think that's OK. Well, I don't. My position is simple: If you are for someone or something, you should be willing to say it out loud. The voters deserve to know. Right now, these shadowy organizations are refusing to produce a list of their donors, and that's something voters need to consider in November. My rule of thumb is, if I can't find out who's paying for the ad, I don't believe it. When my teenager tried to pull a fast one on me, I said if you're not willing to own up to it, how do I know you're not doing something wrong? This election cycle, special interests are trying to get away with buying this election without being held accountable. Until they are more forthcoming with where the money is coming from, how can voters believe a word they say? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sen. Claire McCaskill.","Corporations, unions, special interest groups can fund campaign advertising anonymously .

"(CNN) -- The death of Davy Jones on Wednesday from a massive heart attack at age 66 elicited all the standard commentary about the Monkees, the band that made him a star: The Monkees were a made-for-TV boy band. They recorded tunes written not by them, but by reputable songwriters like Neil Diamond (""I'm a Believer""), Harry Nilsson (""Cuddly Toy""), and the team of Carole King and Gerry Goffin (""Pleasant Valley Sunday""). They were Beatles knockoffs and teen idols. Those points are all valid, but they miss two essential aspects of the Monkees' story. The first is fairly simple: Despite their undoubtedly contrived origins, they turned out to be one of pop's finest bands, arguably the most underrated in rock history. The second is deeper: Their ongoing lack of critical respect speaks to struggles within the music world — authenticity vs. artifice, pop vs. rock — that continue to this day, more than 45 years after the launch of their short-lived sitcom. It's unlikely that anyone, least of all the Monkees themselves, thought there was anything serious about the project when their TV series debuted in fall 1966. NBC and creators Bert Schneider and Bob Rafelson were in search of actors to play a fictional band modeled after the Beatles in ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""Help!"" After many auditions, they chose two young show biz professionals (Jones, the sole Brit, and Micky Dolenz) and two folk-rockers who knew how to sing and play (Peter Tork and Mike Nesmith). From the start, the Monkees had little control over their music and even album covers. Sparkling early hits like ""I'm a Believer"" and ""Last Train to Clarksville"" were written by outside tunesmiths and played by studio musicians. Fairly soon after the show's launch, the Monkees, Nesmith especially, began to chafe at their artistic constraints. In what TV Guide called ""The Great Revolt of '67,"" they demanded control over their records, and out went Don Kirshner, the venerable publisher who had overseen their early releases. This period, what we could call Monkees 2.0, resulted in ""Daydream Believer,"" ""Pleasant Valley Sunday,"" and many other songs on which the Monkees were far more involved (producing and playing many of the instruments themselves). No matter the period or who was behind the console, the Monkees could make magical records, as I was reminded when, by strange coincidence, I plowed through their ""Music Box"" boxed set just last weekend. The collection's four discs reaffirm the largely high quality of their material and multihued variety of the arrangements. They could do credible garage rock (""[I'm Not Your] Steppin' Stone,"" ""Words,"" ""She""), exquisite ballad-centric pop (""Sometime in the Morning,"" ""I Wanna Be Free""), and quasi-psychedelia (""Daily Nightly,"" which features one of the first appearance on record of a synthesizer). Songs that Nesmith wrote or sang — ""The Door into Summer,"" ""I Don't Think You Know Me"" — wouldn't have been out of place on more highly regarded Byrds albums of the same '66-'70 period. ""For Pete's Sake,"" the snappy ""... in this generation"" song heard over the closing credits of each episode of their show, was written by Tork. The Sex Pistols and Run-DMC both covered songs made famous by the Monkees: ""Steppin' Stone"" and ""Mary, Mary,"" respectively. Share your memories of Jones and the Monkees . Jones, who had proven his stage chops before the Monkees by starring in a British production of ""Oliver!"", was more than just their eternally cherubic, always-on singer and maracas player. He could caress the hits (""Daydream Believer""), invest a song with suitable snideness (the groupie song ""Star Collector"") and even co-write a very credible pop reverie (""Dream World""). Yet for all that musical breadth, the Monkees still don't quite get the credit they should, which gets to the issues of credibility that swirl around them and anything considered too Top 40. By the time their show launched and became an immediate hit, it was becoming de rigueur for pop and rock bands to write their own songs, to express themselves. The Monkees did this on later albums like ""The Birds, The Bees and the Monkees,"" but they never recovered from being seen as puppets. They were the right band at the wrong time, and unfairly so. Iron Butterfly wrote its own material, too, but I dare anyone beyond the most devout ""In-a-Gadda-Da-Vida"" nostalgist to make it through any of their albums in 2012. These issues, especially in an era when indie signifies authenticity, still linger. Whenever I tell a friend I'm a fan of Lady Gaga, I receive the same puzzled, ""Are you serious?"" looks I used to get when I told my teenage friends that I'd bought the Monkees' ""Greatest Hits"" long after they broke up. Whatever one thinks of her wardrobe or bombastic, disappointing ""Born This Way"" album, Gaga has genuine talent: She can sing, write songs and play various keyboards. Yet something about her still makes some people squirm in the way they don't when someone mentions an intentionally grating indie band like Sleigh Bells. The music is seen as too polished and produced, and therefore not credible enough. The Monkees may always be tarnished, and perhaps there's a weird badge of honor in that: so disreputable that they're reputable! Davy Jones didn't die for our integrity sins, but the Monkees' reputation has suffered plenty for them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Browne .","David Browne: Davy Jones' death has stirred new round of dissing of the Monkees as fake .

"New York (CNN) -- A woman injured in last summer's shooting in front of the Empire State Building is suing the New York Police Department over its response to a gunman who had killed his co-worker just moments earlier. Chenin Duclos, a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, filed the lawsuit Tuesday in state Supreme Court and is seeking an unspecified amount in damages. Her attorney said police had ""failed to train the officers for this type of situation."" ""It's a clear issue of supervisory liability in the form of improper training, improper attention, possibly, improper hiring,"" said attorney Amy Marion. Duclos was one of nine people injured by police gunfire and ricocheting bullets after police engaged 58-year-old Jeffrey Johnson, who had been laid off from his job as a designer of women's accessories before gunning down his co-worker. ""We have on tape the perpetrator pulled his gun out and tried to shoot at the cops,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in August. It is not clear if the shooter actually fired at authorities. Police officers fired a total of 16 rounds; one officer shot nine, while another shot seven, the New York Police Department said. Johnson was killed in the gunfire. Police said all the passers-by who were injured were hit by police bullets. The violence erupted just as visitors queued up to ascend the famous New York skyscraper in one of Manhattan's busiest neighborhoods. City officials were not immediately available to comment on Tuesday's lawsuit.

"London (CNN) -- One of the first journalists to go on the record and allege phone hacking at News of the World was found dead Monday, the British Press Association said. Sean Hoare, a former News of the World employee who said Andy Coulson ""encouraged"" phone-hacking, ""was discovered at his home in Watford, Hertfordshire, after concerns were raised about his whereabouts,"" the press association said. ""The death is being treated as 'unexplained, but not thought to be suspicious,'"" the report quoted Hertfordshire police as saying. The Guardian reported that Hoare had recently injured his nose and his foot in an accident. It was unclear whether those injuries were linked to his death. Hoare had publicly accused News of the World of phone-hacking and using ""pinging"" -- a method of tracking someone's cell phone using technology that only police and security officials could access -- according to the New York Times. Hoare was one of the few sources who allowed his name to be used when speaking to the Times last year for an investigative report about allegations of phone-hacking by the British tabloid. In his remarks, he specifically accused Andy Coulson -- former editor of News of the World, who went on to become Prime Minister David Cameron's communications director -- of wrongdoing. The Times described Hoare has a ""onetime close friend of Coulson's."" ""The two men first worked together at The Sun, where, Hoare said, he played tape recordings of hacked messages for Coulson,"" the Times wrote in its report last September. ""At News of the World, Hoare said he continued to inform Coulson of his pursuits. Coulson 'actively encouraged me to do it,' Hoare said."" The report added that Hoare said he was ""fired during a period when he was struggling with drugs and alcohol. He said he was now revealing his own use of the dark arts -- which included breaking into the messages of celebrities like David and Victoria Beckham -- because it was unfair for the paper to pin the blame solely on"" one reporter who covered the royal family. ""Coulson declined to comment for this article but has maintained that he was unaware of the hacking,"" the report said. Coulson worked for Cameron until the police launched their new phone-hacking investigation in January, then resigned, still protesting his innocence, but saying he had become a distraction for the prime minister. Last week, the Times reported that Hoare, a former show-business reporter for News of the World, also described ""pinging"" by the newspaper. ""Pinging"" is a term for locating a person using his or her cell phone number -- something that only law enforcement and security officials are allowed to do, the paper reported . Hoare ""said that when he worked there, pinging cost the paper nearly $500 on each occasion,"" the Times reported. A second former editor at the paper backed Hoare's account, speaking anonymously, the Times reported. The Times reported that people on the police payroll were bribed to use the technology to pinpoint people's locations, according to the two former News of the World journalists. The Guardian newspaper also spoke to Hoare last week. He told the paper it was ""bollocks"" that Coulson didn't know about the practice of ""pinging,"" noting that ""the chain of command is one of absolute discipline"" at News of the World. Hoare ""repeatedly expressed the hope that the hacking scandal would lead to journalism in general being cleaned up and said he had decided to blow the whistle on the activities of some of his former News of the World colleagues with that aim in mind,"" the Guardian reported Monday. ""He also said he had been injured at a party the previous weekend while taking down a marquee erected for a children's party. He said he had broken his nose and badly injured his foot when a relative accidentally struck him with a heavy pole from the marquee,"" the report said. Hoare emphasized that he was not making money from telling his story, the Guardian reported.","NEW: Hoare was recently injured in an accident, The Guardian reported .

"(CNN) -- Indiana investigators and the FBI began combing through a western Indiana landfill Tuesday in search of fresh clues to the June disappearance of college student Lauren Spierer. The Bloomington Police Department has isolated a roughly 170,000-cubic-foot patch of garbage at the landfill and may need two weeks to sort through it, the department said in a statement announcing the search. The site holds waste transported from Bloomington, including from bins intersection where the Indiana University student was last seen. ""While working with the company that operates the landfill, Republic Services, waste that was taken from the city on and around the dates of Spierer's disappearance was identified at the landfill site,"" police said. ""That location within the landfill has remained isolated and secured since that time with no additional waste placed in the identified area."" The landfill is in Pimento, about 60 miles west of Bloomington and about 10 miles south of Terre Haute. In a statement issued through police, the Spierer family offered investigators their ""sincere thanks and appreciation for their continued support in our efforts to find Lauren."" Spierer, a 20-year-old sophomore, disappeared early June 2 after leaving a Bloomington sports bar with a male acquaintance. Police said surveillance video from an alley showed them walking toward his building around 3 a.m. Spierer's keys were later found in that alley, but the petite blonde never made it home. One of her companion's neighbors reported seeing Spierer leave around 4:30 a.m., but police said they found no sign of her after the 3 a.m. sighting on any of the surveillance video they viewed from the blocks between the two buildings. In a statement posted on their website over the weekend, Spierer's parents expressed frustration at the ""deafening silence"" among her friends and acquaintances and pleaded for them to come forward with any information. ""There is no reason to think the people Lauren was last with wouldn't do everything in their power to help us find her,"" they wrote. ""The silence compounds our frustration, our desperation and our grief in not having found Lauren,"" they added. ""It threatens to be our undoing, but make no mistake, we will never give up.""","NEW: The missing woman's parents blast her friends' ""deafening silence""

"Washington (CNN) -- As speaker of the House, John Boehner faced battles on two fronts during his first term: fights with President Barack Obama on a series of high-profile fiscal issues, and internal skirmishes with conservative rank-and-file Republicans who openly defied him because they didn't think he was doing enough to cut spending. And as Obama takes the oath of office and begins to address the challenges of his second term, his on-again, off-again negotiating counterpart faces his own set of challenges in the coming weeks. Days after the bruising fight at the end of 2012 to avert the fiscal cliff that divided the House GOP conference -- as well as his own leadership team -- a dozen House Republicans broke with Boehner by not supporting him for speaker in the public vote on the House floor. Boehner was reelected with the vast majority of his conference sticking with him, but the episode demonstrated his weakened position and raised questions about whether he could lead his members in new fights ahead. House Republicans pledge to back Boehner . But after a three-day retreat of all House Republicans last week at a resort in Williamsburg, Virginia, GOP members appear to be regrouping and putting the messy squabbles behind them. Leaders are shifting their strategy away from one of aggressive confrontation to giving some ground to show they can govern. Boehner succeeded at tamping down the public splits among House Republicans -- at least for now -- and adjusted the expectations for his members. Two years ago, a large freshmen class backed by the tea party handed Boehner the gavel as speaker. This group pushed for massive spending cuts and changes to how the government operates. But the dysfunction and gridlock after those demands hit a wall with a majority Democrat Senate and Obama, sending Congress' approval ratings plummeting. Polls show the GOP got the bulk of the blame. For Boehner, just getting the bare minimum done on Capitol Hill turned into a herculean task. Congress faces a trio of major legislative battles in the first 90 days of 2013 -- the need to raise the debt ceiling as early as mid-February, automatic spending cuts kicking in at the beginning of March, and another threat of a government shutdown at the end of March. But instead of arguing as they have -- that their majority in the House is a mandate from voters not to compromise -- GOP leaders decided to start the year taking smaller steps to achieve their goals. House Republicans to vote on three-month debt ceiling extension . At the retreat, Boehner tapped former 2012 GOP vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, popular among conservative ranks, to walk members through the big fights ahead. GOP faces realities of divided government . Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, said the GOP was still determined to force Congress to take up major deficit-reduction measures, but summed up his message to reporters after a session with all House Republicans. ""We also have to recognize the realities of divided government that we have,"" he said. Acknowledging that another contentious face-off with the White House over the debt limit wasn't likely to end well for them, Boehner worked with a small group of members that included Ryan and other leading conservatives to come up with a plan to postpone that fight. As the retreat ended Friday, House GOP leaders announced the House would vote next week on a bill to extend the nation's borrowing authority for another three months. But their plan removed a hardline demand for spending cuts that House Republicans previously insisted had to be attached to any measure to increase the debt ceiling. That so called ""Boehner rule"" -- any increase in the debt limit had to be accompanied by spending cuts of the same size -- was only going to run into another public clash with the White House. Instead, their legislation conditions the increase in the debt limit on a requirement that the Senate pass a budget -- something conservatives complain the upper chamber has failed to do the past four years. And their proposal also includes a provision that says if Congress doesn't pass a budget by the mid-April deadline, its members won't get paid. House GOP aides maintain that the Boehner rule is still in place as they negotiate measures down the line, but taking it out of the mix for now was a major acknowledgment that the fight had become unwinnable. South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney, one of the dozen House Republicans who didn't vote to reelect Boehner speaker, told reporters after the retreat that he agreed it was better to push off the most contentious battle. ""Why wouldn't we deal with the smaller ones first, maybe build up a little momentum, build up a little credibility -- not only with the credit markets but also with the folks back home -- that we can actually deal with these things,"" Mulvaney said, adding, ""I think it makes perfect sense. It's a rational, reasonable thing to do."" Another conservative member, Rep. John Fleming of Louisiana, who noted that he's never voted for a debt-ceiling increase, said he supported the approach. He also pointed out that the move reflected a commitment by Boehner to avoid one-on-one-negotiations with the president on these issues in the future, and instead chart a course internally first. Boehner puts onus on Obama . ""I don't see the divisions now that maybe we've seen in the past [among Republicans] and I think the process has improved,"" Fleming said. Different tone coming out of GOP retreat . The tone coming out of the retreat signals that leaders convinced many of those pushing for broader changes that they need to rethink how realistic it is to send proposals out of the House only to hit a wall in the Senate. But the cease-fire between conservatives and Boehner may not last long. Mulvaney noted that most of the newly elected House Republicans backed his effort to force Congress to offset the disaster aid package for victims of Superstorm Sandy -- a departure from congressional precedent to give immediate emergency money to states without any strings. Although that proposal failed, Mulvaney argued the strong support for it was evidence that conservatives would have more power internally to pressure leaders. Christie: 'Shame on Congress' for not voting on Sandy aid . ""Maybe the freshmen might be a little more fiscally conservative than people expect them to be,"" Mulvaney said. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who heads the Republican Study Committee, a group of fiscal conservatives, was part of the group Boehner tapped, along with Ryan, to devise the three-month debt-ceiling extension. While he helped GOP leaders generate buy-in from conservatives for moving away from their insistence for spending cuts now, Scalise summed up his role going forward: ""I need to pull our leadership to the right."" It's unclear how the debt-ceiling battle will play out. Some Democrats saw the move to as encouraging, but argue revisiting the issue in three months causes instability for financial markets. And House Democrats called the requirement for Congress to pass a budget a ""gimmick."" Fiscal debates will again dominate Congress' agenda for early 2013, but other contentious battles such as immigration reform will also split House Republicans and could test Boehner's hold on the speaker's gavel. After the shootings at an elementary school in Connecticut in December that killed 20 children and six adults, Obama has urged Congress to make legislation with new restrictions on guns and ammunition a top priority. Boehner told House Republicans at the retreat he'll look at what the administration is proposing, but he doesn't plan for the House to take any action until the Senate passes something, and that could be an uphill battle. The GOP retreat also featured a panel with pollsters who showed internal numbers highlighting the party's deficit of support among women and minorities. Both Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and former Puerto Rico Gov. Luis Fortuno urged members to step up efforts to show it welcomes those groups. Attracting minority voters a key GOP goal . Rep. Greg Walden, who runs the House GOP 2014 campaign operation to retain and expand their majority, told reporters he tapped Rep. Jamie Herrera Beutler, the youngest female House member and a Hispanic, to help with outreach. But Walden admitted Republicans need to step up that effort as the Hispanic community was increasing its voting numbers. ""We recognize that Republicans have good answers, we just have bad communications in many cases.""","House speaker's failed negotiations with Obama weakened him among his own caucus .

"London, England (CNN) -- A father and son have been convicted of running a ""family business"" trafficking girls and women into the UK -- including one of their own relations -- to force them to become sex slaves, British police confirmed Tuesday. Marius Nejloveanu, 23, and his father Bogdan, 51, both from Romania, were found guilty by a Manchester court in northern England of deceiving at least five women, then aged between 15 and 23 years old, into coming to England and making them work as prostitutes in Manchester, Birmingham and on the continent. ""Each of them was identified as a potential victim either because they were young, could be isolated from their family, were low in intelligence or for some reason easily persuaded to come to the UK,"" prosecuting lawyer Rachel Smith said during the trial.  ""All the women were promised they would be helped to find work in the UK. All arrived in the belief they would be offered a home, support and the chance of lawful employment when they arrived."" Detective Inspector Mike Sanderson from Manchester Police told CNN: ""One of the victims in this case, when we actually rescued her... was assessed as having the mental age of 10 years old when the fact is she is a 22 year old woman. They are just very, very vulnerable women. They are very immature. They have no adult skills."" Marius Nejloveanu was found guilty of the most serious offenses, including repeated rapes, beating one of the women with a guitar until it broke and threatening another with a knife if she didn't obey him. ""Most of them were raped by him, some were subjected to the most extreme physical and sexual violence and sexual humiliation,"" prosecutor Smith said. Detective Constable Colin Ward, from the Sexual Crime Unit, said in a statement: ""It is difficult to find the words to describe the physical and sexual abuse these women have endured. ""Marius in particular spun a web of lies to encourage the women to come to the UK, whether by declaring his love for them of promising a better life. ""Instead they became prisoners forced into prostitution. If they complained in any way they would be beaten and raped by Marius. He is a very dangerous man who sees women as a commodity whose only purpose is to serve him financially and sexually."" One woman, who declined to be identified out of a sense of shame and fear of retribution, recalled how Marius Nejloveanu lured her daughter into the prostitution ring. ""She thought he wouldn't harm her, and look where she got,"" the woman, from a small village in Romania, said. It was only when Marius and Bogdan Nejloveanu were arrested that she first realized something was wrong. ""All the time she was in England with Marius, she would laugh and say 'Mother, don't worry, everything is all right.' She couldn't tell me more, because he was with her all the time. Finally she admitted he beat her, molested her, to make her work for them."" Sanderson explained how the father and son team generated almost $20,000 each month by making the five young women work for 12 hours a day. Police say the exploitation went on for more than four years. The court heard how Bogdan Nejloveanu gave his son practical help and advice so that he could set up his own prostitution business. Marius Nejloveanu's phone calls and letters, intercepted by police and presented as evidence in the trial, showed how he even tried to keep trafficking women and prevent other victims from testifying against him, while he was awaiting trial in Manchester's Strangeways Prison. In a letter to his cousin, Marius Nejloveanu asked him to take a girl to another relative in Spain because ""he could bring her over to England to start her on some work and that would be great."" ""Also tell her that I love her and that I want to marry her, because if you tell her I want to marry her, she'll fall for that,"" Marius Nejloveanu wrote. In separate letter written to the same girl, Marius Nejloveanu implores her to come to the UK. ""I want you to come over so I can see you because you are my only true love and I want to be with you for the rest of my life,"" he said. ""Don't listen to what people say because people are malevolent and evil and it's because of them that I'm in prison. I love you very much and can't wait to see you."" According to one police recording presented in court, Marius Nejloveanu phoned his mother from prison to ask for help in bribing two of the victims so that they wouldn't appear as witnesses in his case. ""If they don't come to the trial then I can be freed,"" he told her in a phone call from prison. ""Tell them you give them work, tell them you give them 10 million to stay at your place. Yes. By Monday we need to know for sure! Ok Mummy?"" Police told CNN they began investigating the Nejloveanus after a social worker became concerned for the welfare of one of the women working at the Shangri-La massage parlor in October 2008. Brought to England on the promise of cleaning work, that woman testified that Marius and Bogdan Nejloveanu told her she had to pay off a $3,000 travel debt by sleeping with strangers for as little as $15. ""We rescued two young ladies who were being exploited and it took several days to actually get them to tell us about the horrible experiences,"" Sanderson told CNN. ""And what we found was that there were three other girls who were from the same sort of brothels who were basically exploiting them. ""The three girls were arrested, we tried to speak to them but unfortunately they didn't want to speak to us and in this case they ended up getting charged with offenses,"" Sanderson added. ""At the end of the day it turned out that the three girls were doing what they were doing because of the oppression by Marius and Bogdan."" Juanita Huntington, who acted as a ""receptionist"" at the brothels admitted five counts of controlling prostitution for gain, according to police. She would give the money the girls earned to Marius and report back to him if any did not do as requested by clients. If this happened they would be beaten. All three are due to be sentenced on Wednesday, January 26. --CNN's Dan Rivers contributed to this report.","Court: Father, son deceived women into coming to England, made them work as prostitutes .

"(CNN) -- Police are no longer looking for a woman in connection with a fatal shooting and crash that left three people dead on the Las Vegas Strip. ""Yenesis Alfonso, also known as Tineesha Howard, is no longer considered to be a missing person and is no longer a person of interest"" in the homicide investigation, Las Vegas police said in a statement late Wednesday. The 22-year-old was never named as a suspect, but detectives wanted to talk to her in connection with the case. The police statement says the investigation is ongoing. Police didn't say why she was no longer considered a person of interest. Authorities had previously identified Ammar Asim Faruq Harris, 26, as a suspect in the shooting. He is at large, though a black Range Rover police say he was driving during the early-morning shooting has been impounded. Police consider Harris to be armed and dangerous, and say he has an extensive criminal history, CNN affiliate KLAS reported. He has several tattoos, including a small heart -shaped one below his right eye and a large one of an owl that covers his neck and part of his chest. A woman who said she is Howard's mother told CNN that her daughter and Harris have dated for about a year. Miladys Garcia said she recognized Harris from an image that police issued, but that she knew him by a different name. In the shooting and crash, Kenneth Cherry, an aspiring rapper known as Kenny Clutch, was driving his Maserati around 4:20 a.m. Thursday when someone in a Range Rover shot at his car as it headed north on Las Vegas Boulevard. Cherry, who was shot in the chest and arm, later died at a hospital. The Maserati continued into the intersection with Flamingo Road and collided with a taxi, which caught fire, killing cab driver Michael Boldon, CNN affiliate KVVU said. A passenger in the taxi -- identified by the Clark County coroner's office as Sandra Sutton-Wasmund, 48, of Maple Valley, Washington -- also died. All the deaths have been ruled homicides, according to the coroner's office. The fire closed a block and a half of the Strip near some of its biggest draws: Caesars Palace, the Bellagio, Bally's and the Flamingo. Police collected surveillance video from the casinos. CNN's Tina Burnside and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Police no longer want to talk to Tineesha Howard, aka Yenesis Alfonso .

"(CNN) -- Philip K. Dick's stories of warped realities, paranoid delusions and authoritarian nightmares have made him arguably the most influential science fiction writer in Hollywood (not that the movie industry has a monopoly on these things you understand). Yet the film versions of his stories -- ""Blade Runner,"" ""The Adjustment Bureau,"" ""Paycheck"" -- give a highly sanitized, streamlined impression of his work. An inferior remake of 1990's Paul Verhoeven movie, ""Total Recall"" is inspired by the short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,"" about a clerk who dreams of going to Mars, but gets memory implants of the trip as the next best thing (or does he?). The 1990 version of ""Total Recall"" starred Arnold Schwarzenegger. In the new movie, the guy, Doug Quaid (Colin Farrell), commutes halfway around the world from Australia -- ""The Colony"" -- to the only other liveable land left, the United Federation of Britain, to work on an assembly line putting together robots. Miserable about his lot in life, and plagued with a strange recurring dream, Doug takes a trip to Rekall, where they promise to make his fantasies feel true. ""You could be a spy,"" they tell him. ""Work for the Resistance. Or the Leader. Or better yet, both."" Then, just as they inject him, the company is raided in a hail of bullets, and Quaid is running for his life, no longer sure of who he is or what he believes. Screenwriter Kurt Wimmer (""Salt,"" ""Equilibrium"") has cut Mars out of the proceedings entirely, but he's also eviscerated the playful, post-modern wit that spiced Verhoeven's proudly gory shoot-em-up. The new PG-13 ""Total Recall"" can still be read both ways, as the story of a ""sleeper"" agent who wakes up or the story of an ordinary Joe's escapist fantasy. But either way it's an infinitely more pedestrian entertainment, essentially a long succession of repetitive chase scenes, hollow explosions and the kind of speech balloon dialogue that reduces even good actors to robotic mode. Why is it Colin Farrell always seems so much more energized in supporting roles? None of the new film's innovations seems to have been thought through. Why would Britain be spared from a chemical apocalypse that claimed the rest of the Northern Hemisphere? And more specifically, why would Westminster be spared from the fallout, while North London is a toxic wasteland? Why would workers in the Colony commute, daily, by rocketship, to the other side of the globe to add rivets to robots? Can't they get robots to do that? What are the rebels rebelling against -- long commutes? Presumably it's intentional that Quaid's wife, Lori (Kate Beckinsale), could easily be the sister of Resistance fighter Melina (Jessica Biel) -- they might share the same plastic surgeon -- but if there was a point I suspect it wound up on the cutting room floor. As to the look of the film, the shunting gamer action sequences will have you itching for your handset while the teeming CGI almost makes the much-discussed ""Blade Runner"" sequel redundant. A rain-soaked, vertical metropolis fusing Asian and Occidental cultures, the Colony replicates Scott's Los Angeles 2019 right down to the hover cars and parasols, switching Big Ben in for the Bradbury building. It has been given a digital gloss, but that might have been imported from yet another Dick movie, ""Minority Report."" Even the robots are cloned. In short, ""Underworld"" director Len Wiseman has ransacked bigger, better imaginations to produce something that looks and sounds like a wholesale rip-off.","New film is a remake of the 1990 movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger .

Not good. So, why the trend? Well, it turns out Doink the Clown is an old-school WWE wrestler who had just made a blast-from-the-past appearance on ""Monday Night Raw."" I guess this was kind of a big deal. I don't know -- I'm not really into wrestling. In fact, the closest I ever came to a real match was when two of my college friends battled each other inside an old Dodge Daytona to see who could be first out the sunroof. We lost a lot of good brain cells that day. Anyway, according to the WWE website, the evil Doink was known for scaring children and making them cry. Basic clown stuff. But Doink would also bludgeon his opponents with a prosthetic limb. That leads to years of serious therapy. ""So, tell me how Doink made you feel."" ""You mean before or after I went home and cut off my genitals?"" Of course, the really good wrestlers have their signature moves, and Doink was also known for utilizing something called the ""Whoopie Cushion."" Apparently he would butt-slam his opponent's head while viciously breaking wind. Doink was a classy clown. I actually found one good example of this on YouTube, which shows Doink dropping the Whoopie Cushion move on some guy named Barry Horowitz. Yes. Barry Horowitz. I'm not saying my people are bad wrestlers or poor athletes. After all, we did have Goldberg. But if tomorrow I had to get in the ring and you gave me a list of 10,000 wrestlers to choose from, I'm absolutely, positively picking the guy named Barry Horowitz. Unless there's a Shlomo Rothstein. In which case, I choose him. Now, as I remember it -- and this was a long time ago -- unless it was a pay-per-view mega-event, the big name superstar wrestlers always just faced some random mullet-man in a pair of briefs. And won. Because, let's be honest, Brutus ""The Barber"" Beefcake doesn't get pinned by the night manager at Denny's. Apparently, there's an actual term for these no-name wrestlers. They're called ""jobbers."" Their job is to lose the match. Barry Horowitz, it turns out, made a nice career out of getting his brains beat in. Though I'm sure Mr. and Mrs. Horowitz were never pleased with their son's life choice. ""You're such a smart boy, Barry. You could've been a doctor!"" By the mid-'90s it seemed as though WWE (then, WWF) started using fewer of these jobbers in favor of marquee fights to increase their TV ratings. Especially on Mondays. It was 1993 when Raw first appeared on television. Almost 20 years later, they've done it 997 times. So, there's a big milestone coming up. To celebrate the upcoming 1,000th episode, WWE has been sending Heath ""The One-Man Band"" Slater into the ring each week to compete against past WWE legends. This week, they brought back Doink the Clown. Twitter went crazy. And here we are. Doink lost the match within minutes, and most people online seemed to think it was a rather lackluster performance. Alas, on this warm summer night, an old, sad clown was just doing his ""job."" And perhaps somewhere a Denny's was missing its night manager.","""Apparently This Matters"" is our skewed look at trending social-media topics .

"(CNN) -- President Obama answered the following 10 questions on Reddit during a live online ""Ask Me Anything"" chat Wednesday afternoon. Read about Obama's Reddit AMA chat here . Below are the questions and answers as they appeared on Reddit. -------- . Q: gobearss . How do you balance family life and hobbies with, well, being the POTUS? A: PresidentObama . It's hard - truthfully the main thing other than work is just making sure that I'm spending enough time with michelle and the girls. The big advantage I have is that I live above the store - so I have no commute! So we make sure that when I'm in DC I never miss dinner with them at 6:30 pm - even if I have to go back down to the Oval for work later in the evening. I do work out every morning as well, and try to get a basketball or golf game in on the weekends just to get out of the bubble. Speaking of balance, though, I need to get going so I'm back in DC in time for dinner. But I want to thank everybody at reddit for participating - this is an example of how technology and the internet can empower the sorts of conversations that strengthen our democracy over the long run. AND REMEMBER TO VOTE IN NOVEMBER - if you need to know how to register, go to Gottaregister.com. By the way, if you want to know what I think about this whole reddit experience - NOT BAD! ------ . Q: hmlee . I am recent law school graduate. Despite graduating from a top school, I find myself unemployed with a large student loan debt burden. While I'm sure my immediate prospects will improve in time, it's difficult to be optimistic about the future knowing that my ability to live a productive life -- to have a fulfilling career, to buy a house, to someday raise a family -- is hampered by my debt and the bleak economic outlook for young people. I know that I'm not alone in feeling this way. Many of us are demoralized. Your 2008 campaign was successful in large part due to the efforts of younger demographics. We worked for you, we campaigned for you, and we turned out in record numbers to vote for you. What can I say to encourage those in similar situations as I am to show up again in November? What hope can you offer us for your second term? A: PresidentObama . I understand how tough it is out there for recent grads. You're right - your long term prospects are great, but that doesn't help in the short term. Obviously some of the steps we have taken already help young people at the start of their careers. Because of the health care bill, you can stay on your parent's plan until you're twenty six. Because of our student loan bill, we are lowering the debt burdens that young people have to carry. But the key for your future, and all our futures, is an economy that is growing and creating solid middle class jobs - and that's why the choice in this election is so important. The other party has two ideas for growth - more taxs cuts for the wealthy (paid for by raising tax burdens on the middle class and gutting investments like education) and getting rid of regulations we've put in place to control the excesses on wall street and help consumers. These ideas have been tried, they didnt work, and will make the economy worse. I want to keep promoting advanced manufacturing that will bring jobs back to America, promote all-American energy sources (including wind and solar), keep investing in education and make college more affordable, rebuild our infrastructure, invest in science, and reduce our deficit in a balanced way with prudent spending cuts and higher taxes on folks making more than $250,000/year. I don't promise that this will solve all our immediate economic challenges, but my plans will lay the foundation for long term growth for your generation, and for generations to follow. So don't be discouraged - we didn't get into this fix overnight, and we won't get out overnight, but we are making progress and with your help will make more. -------- . Q: silent1mezzo . What's the recipe for the White House's beer? A: PresidentObama . It will be out soon! I can tell from first hand experience, it is tasty. -------- . Q: suzmerk . What are you going to do to end the corrupting influence of money in politics during your second term? A: PresidentObama . Money has always been a factor in politics, but we are seeing something new in the no-holds barred flow of seven and eight figure checks, most undisclosed, into super-PACs; they fundamentally threaten to overwhelm the political process over the long run and drown out the voices of ordinary citizens. We need to start with passing the Disclose Act that is already written and been sponsored in Congress - to at least force disclosure of who is giving to who. We should also pass legislation prohibiting the bundling of campaign contributions from lobbyists. Over the longer term, I think we need to seriously consider mobilizing a constitutional amendment process to overturn Citizens United (assuming the Supreme Court doesn't revisit it). Even if the amendment process falls short, it can shine a spotlight of the super-PAC phenomenon and help apply pressure for change. ----- . Q: FifthSurprise . What was the most difficult decision that you had to make during this term? A: PresidentObama . The decision to surge our forces in afghanistan. Any time you send our brave men and women into battle, you know that not everyone will come home safely, and that necessarily weighs heavily on you. The decision did help us blunt the taliban's momentum, and is allowing us to transition to afghan lead - so we will have recovered that surge at the end of this month, and will end the war at the end of 2014. But knowing of the heroes that have fallen is something you never forget. ----- . Q: daveforamerica . What is the first thing you'll do on November 7th, win or lose? A: PresidentObama . Win or lose, I'll be thanking everybody who is working so hard - especially all the volunteers in field offices all across the country, and the amazing young people in our campaign offices. ------- . Q: PartyInYourMouth . How are you going help small businesses in 2013 and 2014? and what if any bills are you going to implement for small businesses, in 2013, and 2014? A: PresidentObama . We've really focused on this since I came into office - 18 tax cuts for small business, easier funding from the SBA. Going forward, I want to keep taxes low for the 98 percent of small businesses that have $250,000 or less in income, make it easier for small business to access financing, and expand their opportunities to export. And we will be implementing the Jobs Act bill that I signed that will make it easier for startups to access crowd-funding and reduce their tax burden at the start-up stage. -------- . Q: SharkGirl . We know how Republicans feel about protecting Internet Freedom. Is Internet Freedom an issue you'd push to add to the Democratic Party's 2012 platform? A: PresidentObama . Internet freedom is something I know you all care passionately about; I do too. We will fight hard to make sure that the internet remains the open forum for everybody - from those who are expressing an idea to those to want to start a business. And although there will be occasional disagreements on the details of various legislative proposals, I won't stray from that principle - and it will be reflected in the platform. ------- . Q: ormirian . Are you considering increasing funds to the space program? A: PresidentObama . Making sure we stay at the forefront of space exploration is a big priority for my administration. The passing of Neil Armstrong this week is a reminder of the inspiration and wonder that our space program has provided in the past; the curiosity probe on mars is a reminder of what remains to be discovered. The key is to make sure that we invest in cutting edge research that can take us to the next level - so even as we continue work with the international space station, we are focused on a potential mission to a asteroid as a prelude to a manned Mars flight.","Obama answers questions on Reddit in Ask Me Anything chat Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Famed French actress and animal rights campaigner Brigitte Bardot will request Russian nationality Friday if plans to euthanize two elephants at a zoo in the French city of Lyon go ahead, her foundation said. The move comes a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin gave Russian citizenship to French actor Gerard Depardieu, who was angry about French plans to raise taxes. Read more: Will elephants still roam earth in 20 years? Bardot's brief statement said that if those in power had the ""cowardice and impudence"" to kill the two elephants despite her foundation's offer to care for them, she has ""taken the decision to request Russian nationality and quit this country that is nothing more an animal cemetery."" On Wednesday, she appealed to French President Francois Hollande to intervene on behalf of the Indian elephants, named Baby and Nepal, who are believed to have tuberculosis. In an interview with French newspaper Le Parisien, the actress said that the former circus elephants could be helped with the right veterinary care and that the foundation could help find them a more suitable place to live. Read more: France's smash-and-grab tax laws will lead to 'brain drain' The Tete d'Or zoo, established in Lyon in 1865, has about 1,000 animals in its care and runs a number of breeding programs, according to its website. It is not yet clear if any request by Bardot for Russian citizenship would be granted. Depardieu's Russian citizenship was granted to him personally by presidential decree, Russia's official news agency RIA Novosti reported. He and Putin are friends, and the actor has worked in Russia before. In a letter to journalists, Depardieu gushed with praise for the country and its society, RIA Novosti reported. The movie star and businessman recently fled his native France in a high-profile protest of government plans for a tax hike on the richest, moving just across the border to the town of Nechin, Belgium. France's socialist administration wants to raise taxes on citizens earning more than 1 million euros ($1.3 million) annually to 75%. The Russian Federation has a flat income tax rate of 13%, RIA Novosti reported. France's constitutional council struck down the top tax rate measure at the end of last year, but Hollande has voiced his determination still to ask for more from ""those who have the most.""

"(CNN) -- So let's try to recount why we are where we are. In August 2011, Washington was trying to figure out how to raise the debt ceiling -- so the US might continue to pay its bills -- when a stunt was hatched: Kick the can down the road. And not only kick it down the road, but do it in a way that would eventually force Washington to do its job: Invent a punishment. If the politicians failed to come up with some kind of budget deal, the blunt instrument of across-the-board cuts in every area would await. Unthinkable! Untenable! Until now. In fact, something designed to be worse than any conceivable agreement is now completely acceptable to many. And not only are these forced budget cuts considered acceptable, they're even applauded. Some Republicans figure they'll never find a way to get 5% across-the-board domestic spending cuts like this again, so go for it. And some liberal Democrats likewise say 8% cuts in military spending are better than anything we might get on our own, so go for it. Opinion: Forced budget cuts a disaster for military . The result: A draconian plan designed to force the two sides to get together has now turned out to be too weak to do that. And what does that tell us? More about the collapse of the political process than it does about the merits of any budget cuts. Official Washington has completely abdicated responsibility, taking its dysfunction to a new level -- which is really saying something. We've learned since the election that the second-term president is feeling chipper. With re-election came the power to force Republicans to raise taxes on the wealthy in the fiscal cliff negotiations, and good for him. Americans voted, and said that's what they wanted, and so it happened. Even the most sullen Republicans knew that tax fight had been lost. Points on the board for the White House. Now the evil ""sequester"" -- the forced budget cuts -- looms. And the president proposes what he calls a ""balanced"" approach: closing tax loopholes on the rich and budget cuts. It's something he knows Republicans will never go for. They raised taxes six weeks ago, and they're not going to do it again now. They already gave at the office. And Republicans also say, with some merit, that taxes were never meant to be a part of the discussion of across-the-board cuts. It's about spending. Politics: Obama more emotional on spending cuts . Here's the problem: The election is over. Obama won, and he doesn't really have to keep telling us -- or showing us, via staged campaign-style events like the one Tuesday in which he used police officers as props while he opposed the forced spending cuts. What we're waiting for is the plan to translate victory into effective governance. Sure, there's no doubt the president has the upper hand. He's right to believe that GOP calls for austerity do not constitute a cohesive party platform. He knows that the GOP has no singular, effective leader, and that its message is unformed. And he's probably hoping that the next two years can be used effectively to further undermine the GOP and win back a Democratic majority in the House. Slight problem: There's plenty of real work to be done, on the budget, on tax reform, on immigration, climate change and guns. A second-term president has a small window of opportunity. And a presidential legacy is not something that can be kicked down the road. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.","Gloria Borger: Prospect of deep budget cuts was designed to compel compromise .

"(CNN) -- Sports stars love their routines. Some, like tennis champion Rafael Nadal, take it to extremes. The Spaniard obsessively lines up his water bottles before matches, touches the front and back of his shorts, touches each ear and his nose. Nadal will bring his rituals to the Olympics next month, but he faces a real rival in terms of pre-event preparations. Take a close look at Stephanie Rice when the Australian swimmer defends her gold medals at London 2012. ""I'm very superstitious, especially before a race. I go through exactly the same routine prior to standing on the block,"" she told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I do eight arm swings, four goggle presses, four cap touches. It looks really weird but it's so comfortable to me it comes second nature now."" Rice won the 200 and 400-meter individual medley titles at Beijing 2008 as a 20-year-old, setting world records in both events, and also had success in the 4x200m freestyle. She was quite literally the golden girl of Australian swimming -- the 400 IM medal was her country's 400th at a Summer Olympics. However, her return to the Olympic stage this year was by no means guaranteed. Having won silver medals at the 2009 world championships, Rice was forced out of competition the following year due to shoulder problems. Troublesome tweets . She also courted controversy as she called the South African rugby team ""faggots"" on her Twitter account, losing a sponsorship deal with luxury carmaker Jaguar. Prior to her departure for London, this month she posted a picture of herself in a skimpy designer bikini she had got for her 24th birthday. Perhaps it is no coincidence that she was voted Australia's most popular Olympic athlete in a recent newspaper poll. It came soon after two fellow Australian swimmers were censored for posting pictures of themselves bearing pistols. ""I believe truly in superstition and karma, and everything happens for a reason,"" Rice said. ""I believe that if I can do the best job I can, and I always try to give 100% and enjoy what I'm doing, then I believe it will come back to you. ""It doesn't necessarily have to be in the form of winning or getting achievement out of it, it's more about the experience that you get from something. I've learned a lot out of negative outcomes as well as positive outcomes."" Overcoming injury . After missing out on defending her titles at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, Rice faced a battle to qualify for London 2012 following her surgeries -- another shoulder operation was needed in December -- but she triumphed at the Australian trials in March with times that put her back up with the world's best. ""You definitely have days where you feel like it's not going to plan, and especially the surgeries I've been through I've definitely had times I've thought, 'Why is this happening to me now, is this a sign it's not meant to happen for me now?' ""But I try to quickly turn the negatives to positives, try to think of it like it's just a test of character and it's going to make me stronger and more prepared for something that is hopefully going to happen later on."" Achieving a dream . Success came early for Rice when she upstaged Australian Olympians Brooke Hanson and Lara Carroll at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, three months before her 18th birthday. ""Three months out of finishing school, that was the time I really thought I could make a job out of what I love to do,"" she said. ""The Olympics had basically been a childhood dream, and to make that dream become a reality four years ago ... I thought I'd (already) achieved my lifetime goal at 18. ""So I really had to sit down with my coach and reassess what I was actually going to hopefully achieve at the Olympics. So now to be able to represent Australia twice, it's a huge goal and I guess from here on in I'm so thankful and appreciative for what I've achieved, so I take a lot pressure off this time around and just try to enjoy the experience."" A star is born . Rice's transition from promising swimmer to worldwide sporting stardom was one she welcomed. Having dated fellow swimmer Eamon Sullivan before Beijing, she went out with Australian rugby star Quade Cooper until earlier this year and has become a celebrity in her homeland. ""It was really exciting in many ways -- I've always enjoyed the media, I've always wanted to be an inspiration to younger kids or older people,"" she said. ""It definitely had its tough times, and there are times you wish you could switch it off and just be the normal person I was prior to Beijing, but it comes along with part of the sacrifices that you have to make and I don't think of it as a negative thing. ""You just have to be a lot more aware of who you're around and what you're doing. There's definitely times you can be a normal person, you just have to do it in the right environment. ""My goal is to give something of myself to everyone. I don't find that a negative thing, it's flattering, to engage with people and give them a bit of fun."" Role model . But for all the non-sporting distractions, Rice is determined to focus on her pool ambitions. ""I have always been 100% dedicated to what I do, which is why I never studied and swam at the same time -- I always put my heart into everything that I do,"" she says. ""I just try to be a positive role model for the people around me, but more just to be really happy with the person I am and try to give that off to other people.""","Stephanie Rice will defend her Olympic swimming titles at London 2012 .

"(CNN) -- Consider this. On December 17, 2010, Mohamed Bouazizi, a young Tunisian street vendor, set himself on fire and started a dramatic remaking of the political landscape. The striking of a match brought change not only in Tunisia, but also in Egypt and Libya, and even what is happening in Syria. On the other hand, as of August this year, about 48 Tibetans, mostly Buddhist monks and nuns, have self-immolated in Tibetan parts of China. In March 2012 alone, seven people self-immolated, and Tibetan exiles in India have been setting themselves on fire. The political result? Nothing. So why does the self-immolation of one man accomplish so much, but the same gesture performed by so many others accomplishes nothing? Perhaps the question should be phrased differently, because a closer look at Bouazizi's deed and the Tibetan cases reveals that it is something other than the sheer number of self-immolations that makes them a catalyst for change. Two more Tibetans self-immolate in China protest . Tunisians could easily identify with Bouazizi's extreme predicament. His actions spoke to the community's shared frustration and despair. But the demands of Tibetan self-immolators are varied. Some want a ""free Tibet,"" as do all Tibetan exiles, but others only want freedom of religion, or political autonomy, or the opportunity to study in Tibetan as opposed to Chinese, or the return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet. When a self-immolator like Bouazizi is perceived as taking upon himself the humiliations and shameful submissions, the collective cowardice and voluntary servitude of his people, he burns off, along with his body, the diffuse sense of shame and guilt that has been paralyzing his community. The burning body thus becomes a site of cleansing, catharsis and regeneration. The community is going -- vicariously, but no less effectively -- through a ""purification by fire."" And in the process an important thing takes place: That society reinvents itself, it is transformed from a shattered community into a political community. As the body is being devoured by flames, the promise (if only the promise) of a new beginning takes shape. The self-immolations of Thích Quàng Đúc in Saigon in 1963 and Jan Palach in Prague in 1969 were not very different from that of Bouazizi. The former was a Buddhist monk who self-immolated to draw attention to the persecution of Buddhists in Vietnam under the Ngô Đình Diem's regime; the latter was a philosophy student who did the same thing in Prague as a response to the Soviet Union's crush of the Prague Spring. Self-immolations that prompt political change are extraordinary and rare events. The ancient Greeks had two different words for time: chronos for ordinary time and kairos for time of special quality -- a particularly propitious time for which our ""right time"" is a rather weak translation. For self-immolations to be politically successful, they have to happen in kairos. Bouazizi, Đúc and Palach had many imitators, but none since have achieved so much. That's why the high number of self-immolations among Tibetans lately could be read as an implicit admission of failure. Even though the first self-immolation by a former Tibetan monk, Thupten Ngodup, on April 27, 1998, in New Delhi, had some public impact, it failed to cause the political commotion that Bouazizi triggered in the Arab world. Nor have any of the other Tibetan self-immolators since. Yet, this should not surprise us. There is a strong rejection of violence in Buddhism. Even through self-immolations took place in medieval China and 20th-century Vietnam, even though the Lotus Sutra praises ""burning for Buddha"" as the supreme self-sacrifice, Buddhists are very reluctant to condone violence. Tibetan Buddhism, in particular, is centered on compassion toward all sentient beings and prohibition of murder, suicide included. Such a religious and cultural viewpoint must prevent ordinary Tibetans from identifying with the self-immolators. Accommodating this radical form of violence within a culture that has for centuries fed on cosmic compassion and political non-violence is not an easy process. That is why the recent string of self-immolations in Tibetan parts of China is a sign that this could be changing. Most self-immolators are young -- some are teens -- which indicates that the new generation of politically aware Tibetans might have lost patience with the Dalai Lama's nonviolent political philosophy and want to respond differently to the Chinese's aggressive methods. What we see now is possibly the beginning of a new type of political engagement in Tibet, a new pattern very different from Bouazizi's and Palach's, who emerged from communities that had been brought to their knees. Tibetans, instead, over the last 60 years have considered their nation as occupied, but not defeated. Since 1959 they have with some regularity risen against the Chinese authorities. It's very disturbing to watch these self-immolations, but that is part of the intent. The Tibetans want the Chinese and the world to look. The meaning of their gesture lies in its total passivity. It is no accident that after every self-immolation the Chinese authorities scramble to confiscate and destroy any pictures taken; they are only too aware of the iconic status such images can acquire. In essence, these self-immolations are an extreme form of political self-expression. They are performed as part of a struggle for recognition, as an autonomous political community. It confirms what Thích Nhất Hạnh was saying in 1967: ""To burn oneself by fire is to prove that what one is saying is of the utmost importance. There is nothing more painful than burning oneself. To say something while experiencing this kind of pain is to say it with utmost courage, frankness, determination and sincerity."" For many Tibetan monks and nuns of today the burning body has become a tool for the most resounding of self-assertions; when you are in flames your presence cannot be ignored anymore. It is a shouting game of sorts, except that no party shouts. The Tibetans express themselves by burning; the Chinese authorities do the same by shooting Tibetans. Then, another monk or nun engages in self-expression and everything starts anew. Palden Gyatso, a Tibetan monk who spent more than 30 years in Chinese prisons and labor camps, once said: ""For those who use brute force, there is nothing more insulting than a victim's refusal to acknowledge their power."" Rarely has the desire for recognition been so desperate and moving. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Costica Bradatan.","Groups: 48 Tibetans self-immolated in Tibetan parts of China without political change .

"(CNN) -- A court in southwestern China has given heavy sentences to two ethnic Tibetans convicted of murder for ""inciting"" people to set themselves of fire, state media reported Thursday. Self-immolation has become a dramatic and harrowing form of protest in recent years for ethnic Tibetans unhappy with Chinese rule. Opinion: Tibetans reject Chinese rule with one voice . Beijing has taken a tough line on the protesters and their associates, accusing the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, of fomenting unrest inside Chinese borders. The court in Sichuan province on Thursday sentenced Lorang Konchok, a 40-year-old monk, to death with a two-year reprieve and stripped him of his political rights for life, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported. It sentenced his nephew, Lorang Tsering, 31, to 10 years in prison, stripping him of his political rights for three years, the agency said. The court -- in the prefecture of Aba, a Tibetan autonomous area in Sichuan -- convicted the two men of encouraging eight people to self-immolate, three of whom died as a result, Xinhua reported. How many more Tibetans will sacrifice themselves? The other five people didn't go through with the act, either because they chose to abandon the plan or because police intervened, the court found, according to Xinhua. Accusations against the Dalai Lama . Speaking at a regular news briefing in Beijing, Hong Lei, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Chinese authorities hoped that with the verdict Thursday, ""the international community will be able to clearly see the evil, malicious methods of the Dalai clique in the self-immolations and condemn their crimes."" By December 2012, 95 Tibetans had set themselves on fire, with 28 self-immolations in November alone when China's political elite ushered in its next generation of leaders during its Communist Party Congress. At least 81 of the 95 self-immolators died, according to the International Tibet Network, a coalition of some 150 pro-Tibet groups. Independently verifying the reported self-immolations is difficult because of Chinese restrictions on reporting from the restive areas, and the reluctance of local officials to comment on the accounts provided by foreign-based Tibetan advocacy groups. Beijing rejects accusations of oppression, saying that under its rule, living standards have greatly improved for the Tibetan people. It makes centuries-old historical claims on the region. The Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising, has long denied China's assertion that he's seeking Tibetan independence. He says he wants only an autonomy that would offer protection for their traditional Buddhist culture.","The court says the two Tibetans encouraged others to self-immolate .

"(CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama is bracing for the general election fight, and conservatives are likely to throw some jabs at his wife, Michelle Obama, as well. Sen. Barack Obama has told critics to ""lay off my wife,"" Michelle Obama. Conservatives view the presumptive Democratic nominee's wife as a target of opportunity. But one Republican consultant said attacks on candidates' wives often backfire. ""Considering there are so many issues -- legitimate issues -- that you can use on Barack Obama, to attack his wife to me is sheer utter stupidy of the highest level,"" said Stephen Marks, a Republican strategist. ""Mr. Obama is going to come to his wife's defense, and it's going to humanize both of them."" Michelle Obama was widely criticized on conservative blogs when she said ""For the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud of my country"" at an appearance on behalf of her husband in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in February. The Obama campaign said Michelle Obama's comment reflected her excitement about the grass-roots support her husband is receiving, but conservatives said the statement raised questions about her patriotism. Cindy McCain, the wife of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain, also took a shot at Michelle Obama, saying, ""I am proud of my country. I don't know about you, if you heard those words earlier. I am very proud of my country."" In May, the Tennessee Republican Party used video of Michelle Obama's comments in a TV ad that aired during one of her husband's campaign stops in the state. The ad features Tennesseans saying why they are proud of America while repeatedly cutting to Michelle Obama's comments. The Obama campaign called the ad ""shameful,"" and it was condemned by the state's two Republican U.S. senators. After his wife's comments were criticized, Barack Obama said Michelle did not mean what she said. ""Statements like this are made, and people try to take it out of context and make a great big deal out of it, and that isn't at all what she meant,"" he told San Antonio radio station WOAI in February. ""What she meant was, this is the first time that she's been proud of the politics of America,"" he said. ""Because she's pretty cynical about the political process, and with good reason, and she's not alone. But she has seen large numbers of people get involved in the process, and she's encouraged."" Republican strategists say the wife of the Democratic presidential nominee is fair game. ""There is less information about him to temper her comments against, so what she says represents something a lot more important than perhaps other candidates in the past who have had a longer track record,"" said Rachel Marsden, a Republican strategist. The issue of Michelle Obama as a potential liability made simultaneous headlines on both coasts, with articles in both The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times. The newspapers pointed to relentless online rumor mills, criticism on conservative blogs and articles in conservative magazines, like the National Review, critical of Michelle Obama.  Watch how the Obama campaign is fighting Internet rumors » . New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote that the backlash against Michelle Obama, who is black, was a ""good preview of how Republicans will attack Michelle, suggesting that she does not share American values, mining a subtext of race."" The potential first lady appears to be bracing for what may lie ahead. ""We're trusting that the American voters are ready to talk about the issues and not talking about things that have nothing to do with making people's lives better,"" Michelle Obama told ABC News during a joint interview in May. But Barack Obama quickly added, ""I also think these folks should lay off my wife."" It's advice the opposition might want to heed, Marks said. You only have to look back to 1992, when then-Gov. Bill Clinton stood up to critics of his wife, to see how an attack on a politician's spouse can quickly boomerang, Marks said. Clinton later went on to win the Democratic nomination that year -- and the presidency.","Michelle Obama's comment widely criticized by conservative bloggers .

"(CNN) -- The Waldorf Astoria in New York City has long been a byword for exquisite luxury, style and success. From Franklin D. Roosevelt and Frank Sinatra to Queen Elizabeth II and Elizabeth Taylor, the hotel's guestbook reads like an A-list of twentieth century historical figures -- not to mention tens of thousands of well-to-do tourists and travelers. Over the years however some sticky-fingered guests have tried to claim a little bit of the Waldorf magic for themselves, checking out with hotel items as a souvenir of their stay. See also: The best business hotels in 2012 . Since last summer, the Waldorf has been running an amnesty program designed to reclaim these long lost goods. The result has seen the return of precious items pilfered as long ago as the 1920's, many of which provide a fascinating perspective on the history of the hotel and those who stayed there. Although the amnesty officially ended in September, goods are still pouring in from ex-guests and their family descendents. The best items are currently displayed on the Waldorf Astoria's archive website while a small selection are being exhibited at the hotel itself. Check out the gallery above to see some of the of the items reclaimed and the charming history they have accumulated in their absence.","The Waldorf Astoria has been running an amnesty in an attempt to reclaim items taken from the hotel .

"(CNN) -- A second Massachusetts state chemist in just a few months has been accused of mishandling drug evidence, the attorney general's office said Sunday. Sonja Farak, 35, who worked at the Massachusetts State Crime Laboratory in Amherst, was arrested at her Northampton home Saturday night by Massachusetts State Police and is facing two counts of tampering with evidence, one count of possession of a Class A substance, and one count of possession of a Class B Substance, according to Attorney General Martha Coakley. Farak remained in jail Sunday, the attorney general's office said. ""We allege that this chemist tampered with evidence, placing the integrity of that evidence in question,"" Coakley said in a statement. This arrest comes just three months after the arrest of Annie Dookhan, a former Massachusetts chemist at the William A. Hinton State Laboratory in Jamaica Plain, who is charged with obstruction of justice, mishandling of drug evidence and lying about holding a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts. Dookhan, 34, faces charges in several counties in Massachusetts because she had previously testified in various trials in her former official capacity as a chemist. A preliminary investigation found that Dookhan may have touched 60,000 samples that were involved in 34,000 drug cases. Massachusetts authorities are reviewing the sentences of 1,140 people who are in prison after being convicted with evidence at least partly provided by Dookhan. It is still unknown whether the accusations against Farak will jeopardize other drug cases, and this most recent investigation is ongoing and is being treated separately from Dookhan's. In a news conference Sunday regarding Farak's arrest, Coakley noted that ""unlike our allegations against Annie Dookhan, this did not involve 'dry labbing' or falsification of tests. On its face, the allegations against this chemist do not implicate the reliability of testing done or fairness to defendants."" ""Dry labbing"" is the practice of merely visually identifying samples instead of performing the required chemical test, the attorney general said. The crime laboratory in Amherst stores and analyzes alleged controlled substances seized by local and state police. According to the news release from the attorney general's office, workers at the Amherst laboratory contacted state police on Friday to report a discrepancy in the controlled substance inventory held in evidence. An investigation was immediately launched. Based on the investigation, authorities allege that Farak tampered with drug evidence at the lab. In one instance, it appeared that Farak had removed a substance from a case that had previously tested positive for cocaine and replaced it with a counterfeit substance that no longer tested positive, the release said. Authorities also determined that Farak allegedly possessed what appeared to be Class A and B substances, the release said. Brad Puffer, spokesman for the attorney general's office, told CNN that the substances under investigation were heroin and cocaine. CNN's attempts to reach an attorney representing Farak were unsuccessful. She is expected to be arraigned on Tuesday morning in Eastern Hampshire District Court. CNN's Michael Martinez and Marlena Baldacci contributed to this report.","Massachusetts chemist accused of tampering with evidence, drug possession .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Ann Nixon Cooper sits back in her dining room chair, her eyes closed tight and her lips clenched, when asked if she will attend Barack Obama's inauguration in January. Ann Nixon Cooper was born in 1902, a time when women and black people were denied the right to vote. ""I could go and maybe would go, but I'm not looking forward to it,"" says the 106-year-old former socialite. What if Obama came to her house and asked her in person to attend? Cooper perks up and a big smile spreads across her face. ""Oh, yes, of course I'm ready to go!"" It's been a whirlwind ever since Obama mentioned the African-American centenarian in his victory speech Tuesday night. Throngs of media -- from the BBC to a Japanese station to national news outlets -- have descended on her Atlanta house. Strangers have stopped by too. She's taking it all in stride. She stayed up later than usual, until about 3 a.m., after Obama's speech and the phone began ringing off the hook. She had been tipped off by the Obama campaign that he'd say something. ""Somebody told him what to say and what to do and he followed through,"" she says.  Watch ""I'd be proud to meet him as anybody else"" » . Cooper -- who was born during a time when women and black people couldn't vote -- fully understands the significance of Obama's victory. ""Things are changing, changing, changing, and I look for more change now that it's the first black president in victory of faith over fear,"" she says. ""Don't you know, that's quite something to be proud of."" What would she tell Obama if she ever meets him? ""I wouldn't have anything special to say about Obama. I enjoyed listening to him, but that's all,"" she says. ""I would be proud to meet him as anyone else."" She and her late husband, prominent dentist Dr. Albert Cooper, raised four children in her house. The home was a center of Atlanta's black society and the scene of many parties. She knew Martin Luther King Jr. when he was just a boy and was close with his mother. She sometimes refers to Obama as ""that young man."" In his victory speech, Obama praised Cooper's fight. The president-elect had learned of her story two weeks earlier after CNN profiled her when she went to the polls to vote early. Obama called her soon afterward.  Watch Obama talk about Cooper in his victory speech » . ""This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations,"" Obama told the tens of thousands of supporters who had gathered in Chicago on Tuesday night. ""But one that's on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta. She's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing -- Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old. ""She was born just a generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons -- because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin. ""And tonight, I think about all that she's seen throughout her century in America -- the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can't, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes we can."" Cooper watched Obama's speech from her home. ""Yeah, I knew he was talking about me -- I had been told that he would be saying these things.""  See images of Cooper's early voting extravaganza » . She added that her late husband ""would be elated"" a black man will be president. ""Yeah, he'd be so tickled to death,"" she said. ""We looked forward to changes. Everybody looked forward to a better life."" One of her grandsons, Albert B. Cooper, said the family has been overwhelmed with pride since Tuesday. ""It was a bigger honor than you could ever imagine to be mentioned in Obama's speech. For her to be used as an example of the strength -- and all the changes that have gone on within the black community -- is stunning. We were touched and proud and I can't come up with the words,"" he says. ""It's an amazing thing."" Ann Cooper has called Atlanta home since the 1920s. She co-founded a Girls Club for African-American youth and taught community residents to read in a tutoring program at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King preached. Celebrities, including the late singer Nat King Cole, often dropped in to visit. One time many years ago, a young student from Morehouse College stopped to visit. He spoke of dreams to become a filmmaker. That man, it turns out, was Spike Lee. ""It's been a house with a heap of living going on in it,"" Cooper said. Born in 1902 in Shelbyville, Tennessee, Cooper danced the electric slide up until the age of 103. She has recently slowed down after suffering several heart attacks and a fractured hip. On a typical day, Cooper spends hours watching television in her wood-paneled sitting room. Her favorite shows are ""The Price is Right,"" ""Oprah"" and ""Dancing with the Stars."" Three of Cooper's four children have died; her surviving daughter is 83. She has 14 grandchildren living and many great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren. When CNN first interviewed her in October, she said she only had one thing left to see in this world. ""I ain't got time to die 'cause I've got to see a black president,"" she said, giggling with excitement. ""I've got to see that."" Now, she says, ""I would be very proud if I could just meet and shake his hand.""","At 106, Ann Nixon Cooper has witnessed pivotal moments unfold in U.S. history .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Many Americans recall the image of Barack Obama standing on the steps of the Capitol as he was sworn in as the 44th president of the United States in 2009. But they also remember Aretha Franklin, and how she belted out ""My Country, 'Tis of Thee"" wearing an enormous bow that threatened to engulf her entire head. Later that night, Beyonce crooned ""At Last"" while the Obamas took their first spin on the dance floor as POTUS and FLOTUS. This time, Beyonce will perform the national anthem, with Kelly Clarkson singing ""My Country, 'Tis of Thee"" and James Taylor doing the honors on ""America the Beautiful."" Inaugural events have spotlighted the intersection of politics, pop culture and music since the early '60s, said David Gergen, director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard University. ""The person that really changed the nature of inaugural music was John Kennedy, because he was a friend with many in Hollywood -- especially Frank Sinatra,"" said Gergen, also a CNN contributor. ""Sinatra came in and co-produced one of the great shows at an inauguration ... and that became sort of the standard."" Who will be there: Celebrities flock to D.C. for inauguration . Kennedy was 43 when he was elected. Bill Clinton and Obama were also in their 40s for their first terms in the Oval Office. ""The younger the president, the more we see a connection to pop culture and to music,"" said Phil Gallo, senior correspondent for Billboard. ""So Kennedy, you have it. Nixon, you don't."" At Richard Nixon's first inauguration in 1969, the crowd was treated to ""This is My Country"" performed by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir of Salt Lake City, according to the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. Gallo believes you can learn a lot about a commander in chief by the musical acts he chooses to spotlight. ""George W. Bush loved to portray himself as a Texas rancher. Therefore, what's a Texas rancher listen to? Country."" So Brooks & Dunn and Clint Black headlined his first inaugural celebration in 2001. In 1977, Jimmy Carter looked to his regional roots for inspiration. ""Jimmy Carter, he was a Georgian,"" Gallo explains. ""At that time, that meant the stars of Southern rock. So the Allman Brothers are in the White House."" Sometimes the musicians are joined on stage by the president himself. In 1989, George H.W. Bush strummed a guitar with B.B. King at one of his inaugural galas, while in 1993, Clinton grabbed a saxophone for a duet with the E Street Band's Clarence Clemons. But even they were upstaged by the five members of Fleetwood Mac, who famously reunited to perform their megahit that became Clinton's campaign song, ""Don't Stop."" Frontman Lindsey Buckingham recalls the mood that night. ""It was extremely exhilarating and exciting to do a song that you've done a million times, but doing it in a completely different context. As we were going out with the tag, 'Don't you look back, don't you look back,' Bill comes up, and Hillary comes up and shakes our hands. It was just one of those experiences you'll never forget."" Lessons in style from Michelle Obama . That one performance caused Fleetwood Mac members to rethink old grievances with each other. ""Oddly enough, it did act as the catalyst for me to sort of reconsider my options, shall we say, and the band got back together,"" Buckingham chuckled. This year's festivities include a Kids' Inaugural Concert on Saturday and two official balls on Monday night. Performers for those events include Katy Perry, Brad Paisley, Alicia Keys, Marc Anthony, Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson -- a mix of pop, country, R & B, Latin, rock and old-school hitmakers. Gallo says Obama's lineup is deliberately inclusive to reflect his campaign agenda -- but it could just as easily reflect the playlist of the first family. ""It almost looks more like they booked it by looking at the iPod of Barack and Michelle, and then looking at the iPod of their daughters."" Expect Obama's second-term events to be more celebratory than his first-term functions. ""The first time around, we heard songs that had a message that you wouldn't have heard in previous inaugurations -- 'A Change is Gonna Come,' 'We Shall Overcome.' We had people reflecting on the civil rights movement, the fact that we had our first African-American president,"" said Gallo. ""Now, I think it'll be a little more up-tempo, a little peppier. People want a bit of a diversion as we start to think about the next four years."" Gergen doesn't disagree. ""Presidents often choose to make statements about who they are, and what their hopes and aspirations are through the music, through the inaugural address, through the people they bring together there.""

"(CNN) -- It was cloudy the afternoon of January 3 when residents say the cluster bombs fell on the Syrian town of Latamneh. Three rockets containing the cluster munitions fell in nearby fields, apparently doing no harm, but a fourth landed on the street between residential buildings. Its impact was devastating. Read more: Journalists die amid Syrian clashes . One man was driving down the street when submunitions from the rockets exploded, killing him instantly, residents said. Fifteen civilians walking down the street or in their homes were wounded, including women and children, according to two residents and video evidence. Residents said that an hour after the attack, a submunition that had failed to detonate on impact killed a man who tried to remove it from his yard. It exploded in his hands. Since mid-2012, Human Rights Watch and others have reported several times on civilian casualties caused by Syrian use of air-dropped cluster bombs, but Latamneh and other recent attacks are the first known instances of Syrian use of ground-based cluster munitions. The rockets were apparently launched from the vicinity of nearby Hama airport, which is under government control. Evidence we have seen suggests that Syrian government forces delivered the 122mm cluster munition rockets containing submunitions using a BM-21 Grad multi-barrel rocket launcher, a truck-mounted system capable of firing 40 rockets nearly simultaneously with a range of 4 to 40 kilometers (2.5 to 25 miles). Grad rocket launchers are notorious for their inability to be accurately targeted due to their lack of a guidance system. This exacerbates the danger from the wide-area effect of the submunitions the rockets contain. More: Syrian regime denies use of cluster bombs . Many countries, including Lebanon and Cambodia, have experienced civilian casualties from similar types of submunitions, both at the time of attack and from submunitions that didn't explode on initial impact. Each submunition is the size of a D-cell battery with a distinctive white ribbon, and the design of their fuze system makes each one very sensitive and liable to detonate if disturbed. After years of civilian harm caused by cluster munitions, Israel's massive use of the weapons in southern Lebanon in 2006 helped propel governments into action. Working with civil society groups such as Human Rights Watch and international organizations, a broad-based coalition of like-minded governments sought to do something to reduce the unacceptable harm caused by cluster munitions. Read more: Moscow suspends consular operations in Aleppo . The resulting Convention on Cluster Munitions, adopted May 30, 2008, comprehensively prohibits cluster munitions and requires their clearance and assistance to victims. A total of 111 nations, including many former users, producers, and stockpilers of the weapon, as well as countries contaminated by cluster munition remnants, have embraced the ban convention. Yet there has been limited interest in the Middle East and North Africa regions, where just three countriesâ€”Iraq, Lebanon, and Tunisiaâ€”are onboard the treaty banning cluster bombs. Some nations, such as Jordan, say they need more time to study the convention's provisions, while others including Egypt, Iran, and Israel have produced, imported, exported, and stockpiled cluster munitions. Read more: Envoy: 2013 could bring 100,000 deaths in Syria . The 122mm cluster munition rockets used by Syria bear the markings of the Egyptian state-owned Arab Organization for Industrialization and an Egyptian company called Sakr Factory for Development Industries. Syria could have bought these cluster munitions from Egypt, received them through military cooperation, or acquired them another way. With no transparency, it is impossible to say how or when they were made or transferred, though it is likely Syria acquired them long ago. Syria's relentless use of cluster munitions, including in populated areas, is yet another sign of its blatant disregard for international law and the protection of its own civilians. Syria's use of cluster munitions runs counter to the new international standard being created by the Convention on Cluster Munitions, rejecting any use of the weapons. The preventive impact of the convention and the standard it is establishing can already be seen as countries that have joined the ban rapidly destroy their stockpiles of cluster munitions. In Syria, every time the government has used cluster munitions and other explosive weapons, a lethal legacy of unexploded ordnance is created. Given the terrible humanitarian impact, all governments, regardless of their position on joining the ban convention, should press Syria to stop using cluster munitions.

"(CNN) -- Typhoon Sanba was aiming squarely at South Korea early Sunday after passing over the Japanese island of Okinawa, according to regional forecasters. It made landfall in northeastern Okinawa around 6:30 a.m. Sunday (5:30 p.m. ET Saturday) with an eye that was nearly half the island's length. There were no immediate reports of damage. As of 9:50 p.m. ET, Samba was moving to the north at 30 kph (18 mph), the Japan Meteorological Association said. The storm has maximum sustained winds of estimated winds of 194 kph (120 mph) and gusts nearing 241 kph (149 mph), according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, the U.S. military agency responsible for issuing tropical storm warnings in the Pacific Ocean. Sanba is on track to make a direct hit on South Korea in a couple of days, the Korean Meteorological Association predicted, before moving up the Chinese coast. People in Okinawa and along the rest of the Ryukyu Island chain took serious precautions ahead of the storm. The infrastructure on the island is designed to withstand powerful storms, since the island is in an area of the western Pacific Ocean where typhoons are frequent. But storm surge could prove to be a problem for residents. ""It's a large storm, and it's going to have a fairly wide-reaching effect,"" CNN International weather anchor Jenny Harrison said. In the city of Ginowan in southern Okinawa on Saturday afternoon, skies were gray with dark clouds in the distance, according to video from CNN iReporter Kathryn Spoor. Even though it had weakened since Friday when it was briefly classified as a super typhoon, Sanba now has the same intensity as a Category 3 hurricane, meteorologists say. A Category 3, on a scale of 1 to 5, is a major hurricane with winds ranging from 111 to 129 mph. The storm is expected to have a far-reaching effect. It could cause serious flooding in the Philippine capital of Manila, for instance. Sanba is forecast to make a second landfall in mainland South Korea around noon local time Monday. It could also strike southern mainland Japan. Last month, Typhoon Bolaven killed more than 60 people on the Korean peninsula. Bolaven had also swept over Okinawa, which escaped relatively unscathed.","NEW: Typhoon Sanba is on track to hit South Korea .

"(CNN) -- Facebook says a hack that exploited some Web browsers was responsible for a flood of porn, violent images and other graphic content that spread across the site over the past couple of days. Spokesman Frederic Wolens said Facebook's security team had been working to identify the cause of the spam and that, by Tuesday afternoon, ""we have eliminated most of the spam caused by this attack."" ""We are now working to improve our systems to better defend against similar attacks in the future,"" Wolens said in an e-mail. Earlier Tuesday, Graham Cluley, a consultant with Web security firm Sophos, said that ""explicit and violent"" images had been flooding the News Feeds of Facebook users for the past 24 hours or so. Cluley wrote on the Sophos blog that the images included hardcore porn; photoshopped images of celebrities, including teen pop star Justin Bieber, in sexual positions; ""extreme violence;"" and at least one image of an abused dog. ""What's clear,"" Cluley wrote, ""is that mischief-makers are upsetting many Facebook users and making the social networking site far from a family-friendly place."" Several CNN.com staffers reported seeing some of the images by Tuesday morning. Facebook's Wolens said that users were tricked into pasting malicious script into their browser URL bars, causing them to unknowingly share the offensive content. He said no data or account information was compromised during the attack. The blog AllFacebook reported that the social-media giant had been quietly taking down the images for most of the day Tuesday. Writer Jackie Cohen said a request for comment on the images merely got a reply thanking her for ""flagging"" the images. ""The fact that these photos spread for as long as 48 hours unchecked [shows] how much Facebook relies on individual users to flag inappropriate content: people were commenting on the images more than flagging them,"" she wrote. Users were, understandably, distraught. ""Seeing a dead dog on my Facebook news feed ........ Officially deactivating it,"" said one Twitter user in a post collected by Sophos. ""I saw a dead dog, Justin Bieber [performing a sex act] and a naked grandma,"" said another. ""Time to delete facebook."" The Facebook statement said the site has built a mechanism to shut down pages sharing the links and contacted people affected by the attack with information about how to protect themselves. The site advised users never to copy and paste unknown code into their browser bars, always use up-to-date browsers and use the ""Report"" links on Facebook to report suspicious activity when they see it. Facebook did not say anything about who may have been behind the attacks. With questions still abounding, speculation on the Web turned -- as it often does in online hacking cases -- the controversial ""hacktivist"" collective Anonymous. A group claiming allegiance to Anonymous announced it was going to make November 5 ""Kill Facebook Day."" That day came and went with little noticeable activity. But last week, an Anonymous-affiliated group announced in a YouTube video that it had created the ""Fawkes virus,"" a sophisticated tool that would attack Facebook. A handful of Twitter feeds widely acknowledged as being run by Anonymous members had made no mention of the Facebook posts Tuesday morning. At least two members had previously distanced themselves from Operation Facebook, saying it was doomed to fail and that Anonymous is not a cohesive group with unanimously approved goals. ""Using a simple Facebook account, the worm can be carried into other accounts with little or no interaction,"" an automated voice says in the video posted on the account ""AnonSecurity157."" ""We did not expect the intensity with which this would spread."" The video claims the worm can be controlled remotely and that once it's fully understood it ""will use this to its advantage against corruption.""","NEW: Facebook hack exploited browsers to spread porn, violent images .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Jeremy Lin, the undrafted Cinderella of the last NBA season, got peppered with questions by adoring fans and children in Hong Kong. What's it like seeing your name on a jersey? In short: ""Weird."" Did your parents want you to be a lawyer or doctor? No. Can you speak Mandarin? Some. What's your favorite Lin pun? ""Super Lintendo."" When the new Houston Rockets point guard returns to the basketball court in October, he not only faces the pressure of turning around a struggling franchise, but the expectations of the Asian diaspora who have elevated him to near folk hero status. His improbable run in February from a no-name, Ivy-graduate benchwarmer to a starting point guard rejuvenated the Knicks, dominated sports magazines and endeared him to fans in Asia. The Asian-American NBA star arrived in Hong Kong this week, after stops in Taiwan and China. ""The reception has been far beyond what I imaged,"" Lin said, about his Asia trip. ""I'm grateful they support me and care."" Fans flocked into a Hong Kong mall with books, posters and his old New York Knicks Jersey. Some even dressed in Harvard Unversity shirts. Lin, who turned 24 on Thursday, looked at times sheepish by the outpouring of attention showered on him. On Thursday, he tweeted: . Lin appeared in a kick-off ceremony for an initiative, called New World Springboard that is designed to provide underprivileged kids with opportunities to sports and mentorship. The kids asked him questions like how he juggled his studies and basketball when he was a student. They cheered when he spoke haltingly in Mandarin. When asked about how he overcame challenges, Lin repeatedly spoke of his faith. ""I think God has blessed me with unbelievable opportunity, the way he put everything together, the situation, I think it was a perfect storm. God is the first person I'm going to attribute things to,"" he said. When asked the question about nationality -- whether he considered himself Chinese, Taiwanese or American, Lin replied: ""My identity is in Christ."" He also fielded questions about being Asian in the NBA and getting through stereotypes. ""I'm naturally stubborn and hard headed,"" he told the audience. ""Don't let people tell you what you can't and can do. People try to say you can't do this, you can't do that. Continue to chase what you love doing, work hard at it."" Lin signed a three-year $25.1 million contract with the Houston Rockets in July after the New York Knicks decided not to match the offer. He will now play for the former team of Chinese center, Yao Ming. How does he handle the inevitable comparisons? Lin described Yao, who is retired, as a ""Hall of Famer, All Star and global ambassador for the game."" ""What I've done can't be compared to what he's done,"" Lin said. ""We both want to play the right way, inspire kids and grow the game."" ""Linsanity"" fans staked out hours before the event. Ryan Cheng, 20, said he came out because ""there are not a lot of Asian persons in the NBA."" ""He's a true underdog story,"" the college student added. His pal, Vincent Choi, standing beside him chimed in: ""He's like a made-for-TV movie.""","Jeremy Lin is on an Asia tour and stopped in Hong Kong .

"New York (CNN) -- A dolphin stranded in Brooklyn's highly polluted Gowanus Canal on Friday has died, according to the Riverhead Foundation. Emergency personnel gathered in New York Friday alongside the canal, which borders Brooklyn's Red Hook neighborhood, in an effort to rescue the marine mammal, which inadvertently had become trapped in the channel's muck and mud. After being stuck in murky low-tide waters for most of the day, the Common Dolphin passed away Friday evening, according to Joanne Biegert of the Riverhead Foundation. Biegert said there were no further details on what was going to be done with the animal's carcass. ""Usually when you see reports like this (of a dolphin trapped in low water) it means the animal is injured,"" Allison McHale of the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration said Friday. ""It's not a good sign when you see it by itself,"" Mchale told CNN. ""It's very uncommon for a dolphin or any marine animal to be in the Gowanus, but it's happened before,"" Rob DiGiovanni, Riverhead Foundation's director and senior biologist, told CNN Friday. In addition to foundation personnel, NYPD emergency service units were also on scene, according to NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne. CNN's Kristinia Sgueglia and Lawrence Crook contributed to this report.","NEW: Despite rescue efforts, dolphin dies .

"Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- When 58-year-old G. Siripala, a Sri Lankan prisoner serving a 10-year sentence for theft, was escorted by armed prison officials to Colombo's National Hospital with severe back pain, doctors rushed him for an X-ray. Doctors thought he might have orthopaedic complications, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. ""But the X-ray showed a cell phone and two hands-free kits."" Medical staff prepared to carry out a surgical procedure on the prisoner, the source said. ""However, the man said 'Sir, sir, please give me a moment.' He coughed, wriggled, shrugged his muscles and the items fell on the ground,"" the source said. The awkward incident reveals how Sri Lanka's prison officials discovered the latest round of phone smuggling into the high security Welikade Prison, in the northern sector of the capital, Colombo. The prisoner explained his situation to the doctors, recounting how had been chatting on the cell phone with a relative when prison officials carried out a surprise check on his ward, the source said. ""He had no place to hide it. So he thrust it in his rectum together with the two hands-free kits,"" he said of the prisoner. At nighttime, to avoid detection, the prisoners cover themselves with a bed sheet, hide the phone near the body and use the hands free kit, the source added. Cat caught with saws, drills and phone in Brazil prison . Siripala's undoing came when the person he had been speaking to rang back. The ringing tone came from his back and prison officials grabbed him, the source said. The prisoner alleges he was beaten by prison guards, causing the back pain that resulted in his trip to hospital and subsequent X-ray. Prison officials contacted by CNN declined to comment on the matter because there was no such complaint of abuses. Siripala was kept under observation for a day at the National Hospital and discharged on Friday, the source familiar with the matter said. A prison guard stood by his side at all times until he was escorted out in a prison van. Smuggling of cell phones into prison is an all-too-common occurrence, forcing prison officers to use hand-held detectors, Commissioner General of Prisons P.W. Kodippili told CNN. ""Most prisoners, particularly when they are taken to courts for cases, return with mobile phones given by outside parties. We have minimized the problem and are on the alert and catch them when they come in,"" said Kodippili, who is in charge of all of Sri Lanka's prisons. According to Kodippili, the ""worst offenders"" are female prisoners. He told how one, a drug addict, had hidden two mobile phones in her person after a trip to court. ""She had gone to the toilet and sought the help of another prisoner to use a thin piece of iron to pull it out. She was wounded and bleeding. We had to rush her to the prison's hospital."" Kodippili said jammers have been installed in prisons. However, one mobile phone operator had a tower near Welikade Prison and this was causing a technical glitch. ""Very soon we will introduce body and parcel scanners,"" he added. Sperm smuggling alleged at terror prison .","An X-ray reveals a cell phone and two hands-free sets hidden in a prisoner's rectum .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Militants shot dead 17 people overnight, including 10 local Police officers, as the victims slept, in eastern Afghanistan, officials said Wednesday. The attack took place at a police outpost in Ghazni province, according to the provincial governor.

"Washington (CNN) -- Absent an unforeseen agreement, $85 billion in widely disliked spending cuts begin to take effect Friday. The cuts are a product of the sequester, which Congress and President Barack Obama agreed to in hopes of making such slashing so unpalatable that it forces them to reach an alternative. So what did many lawmakers do the day before the painful cuts take effect? Skip town. ""I think the sequester is crazy, I think the president had to show more leadership, Congress should do more,"" said Rep. Peter King, a Republican heading back to New York. ""But just to sit here by myself serves no purpose."" King was one of many congressmen who, before noon on Thursday, walked down the Capitol steps and into awaiting cars to leave Washington. Democrats criticized Republicans for not even sticking around when the cuts start coming; Republicans, in turn, blasted Democrats for not stepping up to do more to reign in spending. Thus, there was plenty of blame to go around -- but not a lot of action. The Republican-controlled House held one vote Thursday on the Violence Against Women Act. The chamber had no votes scheduled on Friday. Neither did the Senate. There will be some movement Friday, if for no other reason than that's when Obama would be required to start implementing the cuts through the end of the current fiscal year. Also, the president is set to meet with congressional leaders from both parties at the White House. Expectations for that meeting are low. Most observers think both sides will use the occasion to underline their positions heading into the next round of the budget wars -- a possible government shutdown on March 27, when current federal funding authority expires. ""I mean, we could stay here ... and not pass ... a bill,"" said Rep. Adam Smith, D-Washington, as he left the Capitol. ""That's not any better."" Obama says spending cuts would be bad for business . Senate holds show votes on Democratic, GOP alternatives . As expected, a sharply divided Senate voted Thursday afternoon to reject alternative plans put forward by Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. Reid's plan got 51 votes in support while McConnell's got 38 -- well shy of the 60 needed to clear the 100-member chamber. Reid had proposed replacing the current spending cut package with a $110 billion blueprint that included placing new taxes on millionaires while cutting agriculture subsidies and defense spending. Most Republicans object to new defense cuts and have called any new taxes unacceptable. McConnell wanted to give Obama more flexibility to pick a set of replacement cuts by March 15. Democrats considered the proposal a trap, designed to put more responsibility for the cuts on Obama's shoulders. Critics in both parties considered the idea an abdication of Congress's power of the purse. CNNMoney: Why Washington can't cut wasteful spending . Who bucked the party line? Nine Republicans voted against McConnell's proposal: New Hampshire's Kelly Ayotte, Maine's Susan Collins, Texas's Ted Cruz, South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, Nevada's Dean Heller, Utah's Mike Lee, Arizona's John McCain, Kentucky's Rand Paul and Florida's Marco Rubio. Three Democrats opposed Reid's plan: North Carolina's Kay Hagan, Louisiana's Mary Landrieu and Arkansas's Mark Pryor. Reid himself also voted against the Democratic bill, but purely for procedural reasons. Reid, McConnell continue to play the blame game . ""Republicans call (their) plan 'flexibility.' But let's call it what it really is: a punt,"" Reid said on the Senate floor Thursday morning. ""Republicans should give Congress true flexibility -- flexibility to cut wasteful subsidies, flexibility to close unnecessary tax loopholes and flexibility to ask the richest of the rich to contribute a little more. Instead, they're completely inflexible -- insisting we risk hundreds of thousands of American jobs, as well as programs that strengthen families and small businesses across this nation. ""But that should come as no surprise,"" Reid added. ""As usual, Republicans have put the demands of special interests over the needs of middle-class Americans."" Hoyer: GOP, avert cuts and share credit . McConnell replied by insisting top Democrats knew before Thursday they lacked the votes to pass Reid's proposal. ""For the president and his allies, that's really the whole point. They want it to fail, so they can go around the country blaming Republicans for a (spending cuts package) the president proposed,"" he said. ""Instead of changing as they promised, Washington Democrats are just turning back to the same old campaign-first strategy they've employed for years."" By the numbers: Congress and fiscal delays . The Kentucky Republican also accused Obama of wanting to the make the looming cuts ""bite as hard as possible -- all to send a simple message to the public: 'You want to control Washington spending, America? Fine, let me show you much I can make it hurt.' "" The same game plays out in the House . The back-and-forth was little different, in tone, in the House. Speaker John Boehner, referred to two GOP-authored bills the chamber passed last Congress on partisan lines to replace the now-imminent spending cuts. Democrats dismissed the bills, which had no chance of clearing the Senate or surviving a presidential veto, as ideological showboating. Furthermore, the bills are null for the moment since they didn't pass the House as presently constituted. But that didn't stop Boehner, an Ohio Republican, from trying to put the onus on the Democratic-led Senate. ""We've done our work,"" he said Thursday morning. Senators have ""not done theirs. The House shouldn't have to pass a third bill to replace the (looming cuts) before the Senate passes one."" Obama says spending cuts would be bad for business . Pelosi says spending cuts = war on women . Friday ""is the beginning of Women's History Month,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, told reporters on Capitol Hill. ""We like to think of it as Women's Progress Month, acknowledging our history, seeing what more we have to do. And why I mention these two points is because of the impact of (the current spending cuts package) on women. It is specific, it is large, and it's substantial, and it must be avoided."" ""Just consider this,"" Pelosi added. ""Cuts to women's health from prenatal care to cancer screenings, cuts to services, to victims of domestic violence -- $20 million will be cut out of the Violence Against Women account. ... Cuts to initiatives to support children and families, like WIC (the Women, Infants, and Children program) and Head Start, cuts to public sector jobs, where women are 50% more likely than men to be employed, and therefore fired."" Democrats ""come to Washington to be legislators,"" she insisted. ""Somehow, that piece is missing in what the Republicans are doing here. They're just making noise. They're just saying something that might have good sound for domestic consumption back home. But they did not come here to legislate."" Immigration detainee release under fire .

"Nanjing, China (CNN) -- Nanjing, a city of 8 million in eastern China, is the capital of the coastal Jiangsu Province. But some 80 years ago it was the capital of China. The revolutionary Sun Yat-sen founded the Republic of China (ROC) here in 1912 after playing an instrumental role in overthrowing the Qing dynasty, the last of the Imperial eras in China. Sun's successor, Chiang Kai-shek, headquartered his nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) government here from 1927 until the Communist Party pushed them from the mainland in 1949 and moved the capital north to Beijing. This gave Nanjing, whose name literally means the ""southern capital,"" something of an identity crisis. But 64 years after the end of the KMT's rule, the city seems to have found its place again as a legacy of Minguo, or the Republic of China. From tourism to dining to real estate, many Nanjing businesses are selling themselves with a nod to the former capital's nationalist past. The city's main center of nightlife, known simply as 1912, is named and themed after the founding year of the Republic. Located a stone's throw from the KMT's Presidential Palace, century-old villas are revamped and dolled-up to house bars and restaurants. The complex boasts of its ""classic Minguo cultural significance"" on its website. Walking around the city's commercial center, Xinjiekou, it's common to see billboards and video screens advertising new real estate known for its ""Minguo flavor."" Yihe Road was the city's Legation Quarter in the early 20th century and is lined up with distinctive Minguo-style architecture -- exquisite and painstakingly intricate Chinese carvings decorate the otherwise European faÃ§ade. The quiet 500-meter strip has in recent years been renovated by authorities to resemble its former Republican glory. While culture-lovers swarm here to trace Nanjing's olden-day charms, university graduates are often seen taking graduation photos in retro Republican-style outfits. Instead of run-of-the-mill black robes, male students don Chinese tunic suits, known as Sun Yat-sen suits, while females wear ocean-blue, wrap-up tops and black cotton skirts. Enthusiasm for this era has also provided the most unlikely of job opportunities in China. Xu Jinshui, 46, is a professional impersonator of Chiang -- a controversial figure for many mainlanders. During the day he stands like a wax figure outside the Presidential Palace. Fully Chiang-costumed, Xu charges tourists for taking photos with him. By night, the quiet Zhejiang native ushers in guests at Ming Du Hui, a Minguo-themed restaurant, still dressed as Chiang. ""If we want to introduce the Minguo Cuisine to the public, we need to throw in a related experience,"" explains general manager Lv Xinhe. ""Chiang Kai-shek is a famous character and people know about him."" The 150-seat restaurant, whose per-head bill averages RMB 300 (US$48), serves food that was popular with nationalist officials. The menu includes yellow croaker soup, which was said to be Chiang's favorite, and May-ling Soong's Steak, a meat dish designed by Chiang's wife. The local communist government seems to encourage the cultural comeback. According to Shen Jiahua, the president of Nanjing Dining Chamber of Commerce, the authorities have endeavored to popularize Republican food since 2011. A dozen restaurants in the city have been certified to carry the ""Minguo Big Cuisine."" ""[What we do is] to pass on the dining culture of Nanjing and create a unique culinary signature of the city,"" says Shen. The well-groomed 56-year-old former soldier owns Yushang Xunfu, a 4,000-square-meter Nanjing restaurant devoted to researching, developing and cooking the cuisine, which comprise the prevailing governmental dishes of the time. Each of the establishment's 27 dishes is coupled with an interesting historical anecdote, often linked with influential KMT leaders, such as Sun and Bai Chongxi, a noted Hui-Muslim nationalist General. Shen spent approximately RMB 40 million (US$6.4 million) decorating the restaurant, which features colossal crystal chandeliers. The clientele are mostly businessmen, government employees and military officials. ""Commercial gimmicks are perhaps the most obvious part of [this Republican cultural comeback], and it is best and most easily manifested through cuisine,"" says media producer and culture consultant Frank Hossack. Hossack, 43, came to China in 1993. The Scot has lived in Nanjing for the past decade and now edits, among other things, English-language magazine The Nanjinger. This specific period attracts the locals because, according to him, it was when ""the government really made the biggest bounds, greatest developments and smartest innovations in what was called the Nanking Decade from 1927 to 1937."" Hossack also regards the nostalgic trend as a reflection of Nanjing's desire to find a new identity, when the provincial capital is often eclipsed by nearby Shanghai, which is a 90-minute train ride to the southeast. Chinese magazine Fan Yue Ri Li defined the Republican culture, or the ""Republican feeling,"" as an ""aristocratic spirit."" In one article, the publication argued that modern China needed this lost essence because, for one reason, ""the general social customs, taste and language are becoming coarse and vulgar."" The lengthy essay was later re-posted on the web edition of the state-run People's Daily. ""To some extent, it shows people partly recognize that era's values,"" says ROC culture specialist Chen Weixin. Although Chen declines to point out the specific values, a general consensus among the Chinese public and media is that Republican times often embody openness, diversity, freedom and democracy, . As an architect focusing on Republican times, 42-year-old Chen has been involved in the restoration of many Minguo buildings, including part of the Presidential Palace. ""On the other hand, it shows that people are connecting with their culture and history,"" he adds. ""Here on the mainland, [a certain incident in] history caused a disruption to the passing of the traditional culture, but the Republican culture was in line with it,"" he continues. ""That's why people resonate with that era's culture."" According to Chen, the Republican culture never went extinct in Nanjing after 1949, even though it did diminish. The city's layout till today is based on the ""Capital Plan,"" a blueprint drafted by the nationalist government from 1930-1937. As Chiang's wife, May-ling Soong, once said: ""We live in the present, we dream of the future and we learn eternal truths from the past."" This may well explain Nanjing's obsession with its Republican past.","Nanjing, a city of 8 million in eastern China, was previously the Chinese capital .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The Iraqi capital, long plagued by violence, was struck by a different sort of horror Thursday night when a swanky floating restaurant sank in the Tigris River. Five bodies were recovered from the murky waters, and two others were believed missing, said Mohammed Al Rubeiy, a member of the Baghdad Provincial Council. The searched continued late into the night. About 150 people were on the floating restaurant, Al Rubeiy said. They were attending a private party hosted by Caterpillar Inc., a manufacturer of heavy machinery and equipment. Most in attendance were Iraqis; some were from elsewhere in the Middle East. Women wailed and men vented anger that such an accident could occur. Details about the sinking remained sketchy. ""I hold you responsible in front of all these people,"" yelled one man at Al Rubeiy. Al Rubeiy said the restaurant had a maximum capacity of 100 people. Restaurants here are usually crowded on Thursday nights, the start of the weekend. The floating restaurant is part of the upscale Lebanese Family Club, which opened two years ago. Bilad Qusay, who was at the party, said he knew something was wrong when patrons were asked to enter the restaurant one by one. When he stepped inside, he could see water on the floor. Suddenly, water pressure smashed the windows of the restaurant and one side went down, Qusay said, wiping tears. He jumped to safety ashore. The deaths came after another day of violence in and around Baghdad. At least seven people were killed and 23 others were wounded in a car bomb and roadside blasts in the Iraqi capital's Shulaa neighborhood. In the Shurta al-Raba neighborhood, two roadside bomb exploded on a busy road, wounding eight people. In Mahmoudiya, about 40 kilometers (about 25 miles) south of Baghdad, five roadside bombs exploded, police officials in Baghdad told CNN. At least two people were killed and five others wounded.

"New York (CNN) -- Celebrities, city officials and everyday commuters gathered at Grand Central Terminal Friday to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the New York landmark. Mayor Mike Bloomberg told the crowd, ""It's a symbol of all that is great about our city. It's rooted in an incredible history while also being thoroughly modern. It represents beauty and art, but also commerce and industry. ""It's an innovative and visionary place, and it has the same power to inspire awe and wisdom whether you walk these corridors every day or you're visiting here for the first time.""

"(CNN) -- An Australian radio network at the heart of a hoax targeting Prince William's pregnant wife canceled the show responsible for the prank on Monday, expressing deep regret for the death of a nurse who took a call from the DJs involved. The two DJs ""will not return to the airwaves until further notice,"" the statement from the network, Southern Cross Austereo, said. The company also suspended all prank calls, pulled advertising and ordered a comprehensive review of relevant policies and processes. The DJs, Mel Greig and Michael Christian, who were impersonating Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles, called the hospital Tuesday and gained some information about the condition of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge -- which they subsequently played on air. On Friday, the nurse who transferred the call through to the ward, Jacintha Saldanha, was found dead after apparently committing suicide. ""First and foremost we would like to express our deep and sincere condolences to the family ... for their loss. We are very sorry for what has happened,"" Rhys Holleran, the network's chief executive officer, said in Monday's statement. ""We don't claim to be perfect and we always strive to do better. We have initiated a detailed and rigorous review of our policies and procedures to inform any improvements we can make."" Greig and Christian also apologized in interviews with the Australian TV shows ""A Current Affair"" and ""Today Tonight"" on Monday. ""There is nothing that can make me feel worse than what I feel right now,"" Greig said on ""Today Tonight."" Christian told ""A Current Affair"" the prank had become ""a tragic turn of events that I don't think anyone could have predicted or expected."" ""I'm still trying to make sense of it all,"" he said, offering ""our deepest sympathies"" to Saldanha's family. Opinion: Why airing the prank call was wrong . London's Metropolitan Police have contacted Australian authorities in relation to the call, but ""are not discussing about what or with who"" they're talking, a spokesman told CNN. A spokeswoman for New South Wales Police in Australia told CNN: ""As the investigation into the death of London nurse Jacintha Saldhana continues, New South Wales Police will be providing London's Metropolitan Police with whatever assistance they require."" Ben Barboza, Saldanha's husband, expressed grief over his wife's death in a post on Facebook: ""I am devastated with the tragic loss of my beloved wife Jacintha in tragic circumstances, She will be laid to rest in Shirva, India."" Saldanha's daughter posted a photo of herself with her mother and wrote: ""I miss you, I loveeee you. Jacintha saldanha."" The chairman of the hospital where the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge was a patient slammed the Australian radio station's decision to broadcast the recorded prank call as ""truly appalling"" on Saturday, . ""King Edward VII's Hospital cares for sick people, and it was extremely foolish of your presenters even to consider trying to lie their way through to one of our patients, let alone actually make the call,"" wrote the chairman, Simon Glenarthur. ""The immediate consequence of these premeditated and ill-considered actions was the humiliation of two dedicated and caring nurses who were simply doing their job tending to their patients. ""The longer term consequence has been reported around the world and is, frankly, tragic beyond words."" Glenarthur called on the radio station to take steps ""to ensure that such an incident could never be repeated."" Read more: Nurse's death casts glare on 'shock jocks' The Australian Communications and Media Authority, the country's media regulator, has not yet commented on the case. However, it will be ""engaging with the licensee, Today FM Sydney, around the facts and issues surrounding the prank call,"" said the regulator's chairman, Chris Chapman. News of Saldanha's death broke Friday, with the hospital saying she ""was recently the victim of a hoax call."" London's Metropolitan Police said that Saldanha, 46, had living quarters in central London provided by her workplace. Police said they were notified Friday morning that a woman was found unconscious at the address. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Police are treating the death as ""unexplained."" A postmortem examination will take place on Tuesday, police said Monday. A spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron said Saturday that he ""thinks this is a very sad case and his thoughts are with her family and colleagues."" Throughout the controversy surrounding the hoax, authorities did not identify the nurse. Her identity was released after her death. Audio of the call posted online suggests a woman spoke briefly to the DJs before she put the call through early Tuesday morning to the ward where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for acute morning sickness. ""They were the world's worst accents ever,"" Greig told listeners Thursday. ""We were sure 100 people at least before us would've tried the same thing. ... We were expecting to be hung up on. We didn't even know what to say when we got through."" A tweet from 2Day FM last week after the incident described it as a ""hilarious prank."" Read more: Radio pair apologizes for duchess prank call . Off the air, Greig and Christian tweeted about the practical joke on Thursday and earlier Friday, promising ""more on the #royalprank."" The pair's Twitter accounts were taken down late Friday. Some listeners applauded the prank, like one who identified himself as Guido on the station's Facebook page and wrote, ""It is only a joke people! it was great i love it!!!"" Others were outraged, with negative comments outnumbering positive ones on 2DayFM's Facebook page even before the nurse's death. ""Your stunt was done at a time in this country where there is paranoia about the intrusion of the media into people's lives,"" Gary Slenders wrote. ""I know you will say it is harmless fun, the management of 2DayFM will say that it won't happen again, but this is exactly where the phone hacking scandal started."" The outcry grew exponentially after the hospital confirmed Saldanha's death, leading the Coles supermarket chain to remove all its advertising from 2DayFM. ""This death is on your conscience,"" reads one Facebook post. Several accused the two DJs of having ""blood on your hands."" Saldanha's family released a statement asking for privacy and directing questions to police. She is survived by her husband and two children. ""We as a family are deeply saddened by the loss of our beloved Jacintha,"" said the statement, released by police. Saldanha worked at King Edward VII's Hospital for more than four years, and she was described as an ""excellent nurse,"" well-respected by co-workers, the hospital statement said. The hospital ""had been supporting her throughout this difficult time,"" it said. A St. James's Palace spokesman said: ""The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are deeply saddened to learn of the death. ""Their Royal Highnesses were looked after so wonderfully well at all times by everybody at King Edward VII Hospital, and their thoughts and prayers are with Jacintha Saldanha's family, friends and colleagues at this very sad time."" Separately, a palace spokesman told CNN: ""At no point did the palace complain to the hospital about the incident. On the contrary, we offered our full and heartfelt support to the nurses involved and hospital staff at all times.""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama is showing his softer side. The man who was known in his first term for his cool, detached style has been crying, repeatedly. It started the day after his re-election when a teary and happy president told campaign volunteers, ""I'm so proud of you guys."" A month later he was overcome by grief as he wept openly in the White House briefing room after the Newtown, Connecticut, shootings. There were tears again during a heroes ceremony for Newtown victims, and while delivering remarks about Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The evolution of the nation's 'first gay president' Second-term Obama is not just showing his emotions, he's sharing them, too -- laughing with the Miami Heat at the White House and telling people in a Chicago audience that they're in the area where ""Michelle and I fell in love."" The president's biographer attributes the shift to a new sense of freedom from winning a second term. ""I think we've all seen, actually since the day after his re-election a more relaxed Barack Obama, really something that took a lifetime for him to get to this point,"" David Maraniss said. ""We've really seen a new Obama."" The ""new"" Obama is venturing into territory the first term Obama shied away from. Obama urges court to overturn California same-sex marriage ban . He talked about his complicated biracial identity in this eulogy for Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii. ""Here I was, a young boy with a white mom, a black father, raised in Indonesia and Hawaii,"" the president said at the National Cathedral in Washington. ""And I was beginning to sense how fitting into the world might not be as simple as it might seem."" To kids at home in Chicago, he admitted he was often in trouble when he was a teenager. ""When I screwed up, the consequences weren't as high as when kids on the South Side screw up,"" he told them. ""So I had more of a safety net but these guys are no different than me."" And, he used unusually personal language to describe King's struggles. ""We often think of him standing tall in front of these endless crowds, stirring the nation's conscience with a bellowing voice and a mighty dream. But I also thought of his doubts ... the lonely moments when he was left to confront the presence of long-festering injustice and undisguised hate,"" Obama told a crowd at the National Prayer Breakfast in February. ""(I) imagined the darkness and the doubt that must have surrounded him when he was in that Birmingham jail, and the anger that surely rose up in him the night his house was bombed."" The president and the nation have evolved on same-sex marriage . Obama's biographer says a more complete personality is coming into focus. ""I don't think one ever knows the real him. But I think that it's closer to being the private and the public Obama coming together in a clearer way,"" Maraniss said. This warmer more revealing Obama was on display during the 2008 campaign. Then he used his biography to sell himself as the melting pot embodied. His most vocal critics turned parts of his resume into punch lines, perhaps most memorably by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin at the 2008 Republican National Convention. ""I guess a small-town mayor is sort of like a community organizer, except you have actual responsibilities,"" Palin said. Perhaps in reaction, once in office the president became more cautious about talking about his past. On most topics, he just didn't go there. Obama: Spending cuts would be bad for business . But now, free of the pressure to woo swing voters, he's back to using his story and his rhetorical skills to try to inspire audiences and pitch policies. Obama himself said Tuesday night in Virginia: ""I've run my last election."" He told CBS' Charlie Rose last summer that the biggest mistake of his first term was not communicating his vision with the American people. ""When I think about what we've done well and what we haven't done well, the mistake of my first term -- couple of years -- was thinking that this job was just about getting the policy right,"" he said. ""And that's important but the nature of this office is also to tell a story to the American people that gives them a sense of unity and purpose and optimism, especially during tough times."" These days he's hardly touchy-feely, but he's more likely to wear his heart on his sleeve. And use passion for political effect. During the fight over forced spending cuts, he's made a clear effort to put faces on the impending changes. At one White House event, he got emotional as he stood in front of a group of first responders. ""And this is not an abstraction. There are people whose livelihoods are at stake. There are communities that are going to be impacted in a negative way,"" he said. ""And I know that sometimes all this squabbling in Washington seems very abstract, and in the abstract, people like the idea, there must be some spending we can cut, there must be some waste out there. There absolutely is. But this isn't the right way to do it."" Rewind back to four years ago in March 2009, the same president was confronted with a teacher about to lose her job. Instead of consoling her or expressing her concern, he asked if she got a ""pink slip"" and launched into his views on education policy. These days he's doing better on the empathy test. In a gun control plea at his recent State of the Union address, the chamber rose to its feet as a fervent Obama reminded the country of recent tragedies. ""Gabby Giffords deserves a vote. The families of Newtown deserve a vote,"" Obama said on the House floor. ""The families of Aurora deserve a vote. The families of Oak Creek and Tucson and Blacksburg and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence, they deserve a simple vote."" That's the kind of emotional rallying cry he once saved for campaign style events outside the Beltway. No longer. Even the president admits he has changed, in repeated humble brags. ""The fascinating thing about this job is the longer you're in it, the more humble you get and the more you recognize your own imperfections,"" he told House Democrats at their retreat in Virginia. ""The one thing about being president is after four years, you get pretty humble,"" Obama said Tuesday. ""You think maybe you wouldn't but you become more humble. You realize what you don't know. You realize, you know, all the mistakes you make."" It's humility he can afford, after winning a second term. ""President Obama is never going to be the 'I feel your pain' Bill Clinton-type of president but he's getting closer,"" Maraniss said.","Obama -- known in his first term for his cool, detached style -- has been seen crying .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A spate of bombs exploded in Baghdad on Sunday, killing at least 21 people and wounding 125 others, police said. The blasts -- six car bombs and three roadside explosions -- mainly targeted outdoor markets in Shiite neighborhoods, Baghdad police said. Overall violence has dropped significantly in Iraq since the peak of sectarian violence, between 2005 and 2007. Yet such attacks continue as the 10-year anniversary of the U.S-led invasion of Iraq nears next month. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad condemned the attacks. Recent attacks in Shiite areas have spread fear among Iraqis that sectarian warfare may ravage the country again. Sunnis demand that the Shiite-led government stop what they call second-class treatment of Iraq's Sunni community. Sunnis largely boycotted Iraq's 2005 elections, leading to the emergence of a Shiite-led government. The move left the once-ruling minority disaffected. Last month, at least 177 Iraqi civilians, soldiers and police officers were killed in attacks, according to figures compiled by Iraq's interior, defense and health ministries. The casualties were predominantly civilians, according to the ministries. The total does not include those killed in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region, which keeps its own death toll. Security has deteriorated since last December, when Sunni demonstrators in provinces such as Anbar and Mosul called for an end to what they considered second-class treatment. The protests were triggered when Iraqi security forces arrested several bodyguards of Finance Minister Rafie al-Essawi, a Sunni.","At least 125 others are wounded in six car bombings and three roadside bombs .

"(CNN) -- Venezuela's armed forces will back ailing President Hugo Chavez's new term amid uncertainty of what a possible power transition might look like, the country's defense minister said. Chavez was unable to be sworn in last week for a new term because he is in Cuba recovering from a fourth cancer surgery. His absence at the inauguration raised constitutional questions about who is in charge of the country, opposition politicians said. Read more: Chavez misses key speech, but names new foreign minister, Venezuelan VP says . The Supreme Court clarified the issue last week, ruling that Chavez remains president and can be sworn in at a later date. The army will defend that decision, Defense Minister Diego Molero Bellavia said Wednesday. ""Soldiers will abide by and enforce the Supreme Court decision to allow the head of state to return home when his health improves,"" he said. Read more: Venezuela says Chavez is improving . Molero added that the armed forces have ""unconditional loyalty, now more than ever, to commander Hugo Chavez.""

""In spite of the delicate state of his health... the general medical evolution has been favorable in recent days,"" a government statement said, noting that a lung infection Chavez has been battling was under control. Neither Chavez nor the government has said what type of cancer he has, sparking growing speculation about his health and political future. Opposition politicians have decried the lack of transparency, while government officials have accused political opponents and right-wing media of trying to destabilize the government by spreading rumors.

The long absence is not typical of the loquacious leader. Read more: Chavez will not be sworn in on inauguration day . On Tuesday, Vice President Nicolas Maduro stood in for Chavez at the annual state of the union speech. Maduro announced that a former vice president, Elias Jaua, will begin serving as foreign minister. Maduro said that Chavez himself made the designation. Some opposition politicians questioned whether Chavez had actually nominated a new foreign minister, or whether Maduro had effectively taken over the presidency. ""If the president of the republic can sign decrees, I call on him to appear and speak to Venezuela and tell the people what's happening in our government, because in Venezuela what we have is lack of governance,"" said Henrique Capriles, who unsuccessfully ran against Chavez in the last elections. Capriles spoke at his own inauguration, as governor of the state of Miranda, a post he was elected to following his presidential defeat. He accused the Chavez government of trying to divide the public. ""Never again will Venezuelans fight among themselves,"" he said. ""Never again will we ask the people to get involved in a war. This government wants war; we want peace. This government wants to go backwards; we want progress."" The rising political tension in Venezuela spilled over into a meeting of the Organization of American States on Wednesday. Panama's ambassador, Guillermo Cochez, criticized the regional body for not taking a stand against the situation in Venezuela, which he described as a ""sick democracy."" Venezuelan Ambassador Roy Chaderton quickly fired back, calling Cochez's comments ""poisonous"" and ""miserable"" and accusing him of conspiring with members of the opposition to destabilize Venezuela's government. Hours later, Panama's government disavowed Cochez's remarks, saying they were improvised and did not represent the country's position. ""Panama reiterates that it will continue to respect to the internal political processes of states,"" Panama's foreign ministry said in a statement, ""and, in the case of Venezuela, we are praying for the quick recovery of President Hugo Chavez.""

"(CNN) -- The man whose face was chewed off by a naked man in a brutal assault in Miami says he doesn't know why his attacker singled him out, according to CNN affiliate WFOR. ""He attacked me,"" Ronald Poppo said of his assailant in a police recording obtained by the affiliate and broadcast Thursday. ""He just ripped me to ribbons. He chewed up my face. He plucked out my eyes. Basically that's all there is to say about it."" Poppo, who is now blind, said he initially thought Rudy Eugene, 31, was ""a good guy."" ""But he just went and turned berserk,"" he recalled of the May incident. ""He apparently didn't have a good day at the beach and he -- he was coming back. And I guess he took it out, took it out on me or something. I don't know."" Poppo's statements were made and recorded during a July 19 interview with Miami police. Eugene was killed by a police officer after the 18-minute attack, which was captured by on video by a surveillance camera. It shows Eugene coming across 65-year-old Poppo on a sidewalk along Miami's MacArthur Causeway, stripping clothes off him and eventually chewing on his face. Police said Poppo lost 75% of his face in the attack. A police official initially theorized that Eugene was under the influence of ""bath salts,"" a drug that contains synthetic stimulants that can ""cause chest pains, increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, agitation, hallucinations, extreme paranoia and delusions,"" according to the National Institute of Drug Abuse. But an autopsy and lab tests showed the man had used marijuana, and had no alcohol, other street drugs or prescription drugs in his system.","Poppo said he initially thought Rudy Eugene, 31, was ""a good guy""

"Washington (CNN) -- December's school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, has prompted congressional lawmakers and the White House to offer a number of proposals aimed at curbing gun violence. Here are some of the measures garnering the most attention: . The White House plan . President Barack Obama signed 23 executive actions, which don't require congressional approval, to strengthen existing gun laws and take related steps on mental health and school safety. He has also called on Congress to reinstate the Clinton-era assault weapons ban that expired in 2004, to restrict ammunition magazines to no more than 10 rounds, and to expand background checks to anyone buying a gun, whether at a store or in a private sale at an auction or convention. Assault weapons ban revisited . A proposal by Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-California, would not ban ownership of assault weapons outright, but would prohibit new ones from being manufactured, sold or imported. It would also outlaw ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. She said the goal is to ""dry up the supply of these weapons over time."" The measure, along with a companion bill in the House, is opposed by the nation's powerful gun lobby, led by the National Rifle Association. Gun focus shifts from ban to checks and trafficking . Cracking down on straw purchases . Vermont Democrat Sen. Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has called for stronger background checks and a crackdown on so-called straw purchases, in which people who can pass background checks buy weapons for others. Leahy has proposed a measure to increase penalties for straw purchasers. Curbing gun trafficking . A new House bipartisan gun control bill seeks to make gun trafficking a federal crime. It has some bipartisan support and mirrors a measure proposed in the Senate. House Democratic efforts . A group of House Democrats, who were part of the chamber's Democratic Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, unveiled 15 proposals to address gun violence. The measures largely echoed those previously backed by the White House. The package is similar to other Democratic measures that would address background checks, ban high capacity magazines, and crack down on gun trafficking. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Viginia, told CNN that he supports beefed up background checks for gun sales. Newtown calls on Connecticut to 'show America the way' on gun control . Closing gun show loophole . A group of four senators working behind the scenes on a bipartisan bill to expand background checks on gun sales is making significant progress, according to sources in both parties familiar with their work. The group includes Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, who has an A rating with the National Rifle Association, and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, a long time advocate of gun rights. The legislation would effectively require background checks on private gun purchases made with non-licensed gun dealers, according to sources in both parties. That would include closing the so-called gun show loophole. Why new laws could miss America's bigger gun problem . Political play . House Speaker John Boehner has said he has no plans to bring any measure up for a vote until the Senate acts first. Republicans oppose any assault weapons ban and rural-state Democrats facing tough re-election fights are unlikely to support it as well, meaning that proposal has little chance of passing Congress. There is some bipartisan support for expanded background checks, especially to keep guns out of the hands of people with mental illness. A number of lawmakers may also support limiting the size of ammunition magazines. Some lawmakers have said that various gun proposals may be addressed in separate bills, rather than a comprehensive package, which could more easily be targeted by opponents. The top Democrat in Congress, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, has a good rating from gun rights groups and has said he would work to ensure that a variety of proposals are brought to the floor for consideration. He opposed the 1994 assault weapons ban and has indicated support for expanding background checks but refuses to endorse a new weapons prohibition.

"(CNN) -- Another day, another big name crashes out of the World Golf Championship event at Dove Mountain. The world's top two players, Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods departed after the first round of the Accenture Match Play in Arizona, former No. 1 Luke Donald exited on Friday along with Sergio Garcia and Justin Rose, and now Bubba Watson and Martin Kaymer are out of the running as well. Masters champion Watson was beaten by Australian Jason Day in Saturday's early tee-offs, with the tournament schedule crammed due to snow at the desert course which wiped out the first day in midweek. The American went down 4 and 3 as Day cruised into the afternoon quarterfinals, where he was to face former U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell. ""Jason Day just played better,"" Watson, who went to four extra holes before beating Jim Furyk on Friday, wrote on Twitter. ""But my ball striking is better and excited about the rest of the year!"" McDowell ended the dream run of Shane Lowry, who had beaten his fellow Northern Irishman McIlroy. Lowry, who is from the Republic of Ireland, was the lowest-ranked player in the 64-man field but edged past McIlroy 1-up before defeating Sweden's world No. 35 Carl Petterson. McDowell, ranked 19th, triumphed 3 and 2 on Saturday as he followed up his wins against Ireland's three-time major champion Padraig Harrington and world No. 51 Alexander Noren of Sweden. Day, ranked 43rd, beat 2007 Masters winner Zach Johnson in his opening match and then disposed of American PGA Tour rookie Russell Henley -- who won the Sony Open in Hawaii last month. ""It was just really steady golf,"" Day said. ""Bubba gave me a couple early on and I just tried to hold that lead, and I tried to extend it. ""I think I was four under through 14 holes, so overall very, very happy with how I played."" Former world No. 1 Kaymer was thrashed 5 and 4 by 25th-ranked defending champion Hunter Mahan, who earned a quarterfinal against U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson. Mahan has now been ahead in every match he has played at the tournament since the sixth hole of last year's opening match -- a run of 133 holes. ""If you hit fairways and greens, you know you're going to put pressure on your guy,"" the American said after his win over the 2011 runner-up, which avenged that year's third-round defeat to the German. ""It's definitely nice to get a lead and that's the goal for everybody, but to do it, it's a good feeling for sure."" Simpson, ranked 17th, won 2-up against Spain's No. 33 Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano. England's Ian Poulter, the 2010 Match Play winner, set up a clash with 2001 champion Steve Stricker. Poulter thrashed South Africa's Tim Clark 5 and 3 while veteran American Stricker beat Donald's conqueror Scott Piercy. ""Quick bite for lunch and then another match this afternoon,"" Poulter, playing in his first tournament for six weeks, wrote on Twitter. ""Keep plugging away and stay out of trouble."" The other quarterfinal was between Americans Matt Kuchar, who last year reached fifth in the world rankings before dropping to 23rd now, and big-hitting Arizona-based No. 38 Robert Garrigus.","Masters champion Bubba Watson beaten in third round of Accenture World Match Play .

"(CNN) -- The Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas lies just 200 miles from the Mexican border. On Sunday it will host the first U.S. Grand Prix since 2007 -- and thousands of Formula One fans are expected to cross the Rio Grande to cheer on a driver they know as ""Checo."" Sergio Perez has become one of the darlings of Mexico, a country that in recent times has become more synonymous for the drugs war waged by Felipe Calderon during his tenure as president. The sporting focus this weekend will be on America, but the problems of its neighbor will come into sharp focus in the Mexican town of Nuevo Laredo -- the closest crossing point for those hoping to see Perez at what is, in effect, his home race. It is a town that in recent months has become awash with drug-related killings, the most recent resulting in 10 suspected criminals being shot dead in a gunfight with soldiers and the police last month. Nationwide, the battle against drugs in the last six years has accounted for 60,000 deaths, 16,000 bodies remain unidentified and 24,000 people are missing. It's an issue that Perez would rather not speak about. Not that he shies away from hard subjects in conversation, but simply because he would love his country to be remembered for other reasons. ""My country is really only in the media for drugs and violence, which is sad,"" says the 22-year-old from Guadalajara. ""And yes there have been problems with the Mafia and drugs, but it's getting better. ""People need to focus on the fact it's a great place, with some great beaches and some great people. It's the best country in the world and I'm so proud to be Mexican,"" adds Perez, as his bright smile breaks out for the first time in conversation. It's not difficult to see his appeal. Perez has given his country much-needed positive headlines with his performances for the Sauber team over the past two years, and many of his 114 million compatriots aspire to emulate his success story. The times he has been able to return home this season have been relatively few and far between -- such is the punishing schedule of an F1 driver -- but the reaction is always the same, and it's not uncommon for Perez to be mobbed in public. In Guadalajara, he is vying for the crown of the city's favorite son with his close friend Javier Hernandez, who plays for top English soccer club Manchester United. Perez knew ""Chicharito"" long before he became a household name in the Premier League, and talks fondly of watching him play for his home city in past seasons. ""The thing is I didn't know how good he was then,"" says Perez, himself a keen footballer and, like Hernandez, a striker. ""If I did I would have bought him myself, sold him and made lots of money! ""But obviously I watched him many times play for our city and he was clearly very good. But it was still a surprise for us when Manchester United signed him. But he's been very good and scored some good goals lately both for Man Utd and for Mexico."" The pair remain in close contact via text, with Hernandez berating Perez for his association with Chelsea, which signed up as a partner to the Sauber team earlier this season. ""He doesn't like seeing me in Chelsea colors,"" admits Perez with a smile. Next season, that will no longer be a problem because Perez is moving up the grid to McLaren, a deal that was sealed last month and which led to a wave of texts of congratulations from Hernandez among others. Perez has been hot property in his sophomore F1 season following a trio of podium finishes at a team usually more renowned for keeping pace somewhere in the midfield of the grid. And he admits his sudden rise to the top draws parallels with Hernandez -- who scored just 18 minutes into his United debut and was crowned player of the year for the 2010-11 season as the club won a record 19th English title. ""I guess it's similar, yes,"" Perez says. ""I hope I start at McLaren like Chicharito did at Man Utd."" Perez does not lack for ambition or confidence. When asked about his goals for next season, he says deadpan: ""Just one goal -- to be world champion."" While admirable as a target, it's highly unlikely. For one thing, McLaren is still struggling to match the pace of the front-running Red Bulls despite Perez's repeated mantra that ""I've joined the best team in the world."" Then there is the fact that alongside him in the other McLaren is Jenson Button, 10 years old and wiser, and with a world title and 14 race wins to his name. But Perez is not deterred by such statistics and, in conversation, it's hard not to buy into his positive outlook -- which McLaren has clearly done by paying him a reported $11 million a year. ""My target straight away is to win the world championship,"" he says. ""I need to get wins to do that. I know it will be very hard to win the championship but it's the challenge I want."" Perez is looking forward to working with Button, whose relationship with current teammate Lewis Hamilton has seemingly deteriorated this year. ""I've spoken to Jenson a bit since I signed for McLaren,"" says Perez. ""He seems to be a great guy and I think he'll be good fun as a teammate. He's a very tough guy to beat and is very experienced. He's one of the fastest guys out there."" Not perhaps quite as quick as 2008 world champion Hamilton, who is potentially a daunting act to follow. ""For sure, I've got big shoes to fill,"" says Perez. ""I rate him very highly and he's maybe the fastest out there. It's going to be tough to follow what he did."" McLaren bosses are confident he will do just that, despite the fact Perez has not picked up a single point at Sauber since signing for the team. But it is not the last few races on which the British team reached its decision. Perez, the son of a former Mexican F3 champion and whose elder brother is a NASCAR racer, has always been quick -- he showed that in F1's feeder series competitions. However, he has been prone to lapses in concentration and occasional errors. Those have been rarer this year, and he has been notoriously kind on his Pirelli tires, which in turn has helped him bag top-three placings in Malaysia, Canada and Italy. Where once he was considered aggressive -- and that still flares up on occasion -- Perez has a smooth driving style, akin to Button. It makes him a perfect fit for McLaren's engineers, who can build the car around essentially similar drivers. His efforts this season were not enough, however, to persuade Ferrari to take a risk on him and sign him as a replacement for Felipe Massa. Perez is a product of the Ferrari driver academy and appeared to be being groomed for a role at the ""Prancing Horse."" But Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo put paid to that back in September by claiming that he lacked the experience required for F1's most successful team. McLaren, looking for a replacement for the Mercedes-bound Hamilton, decided to take the gamble but there is enough to suggest it will pay off. His departure will prove costly for Sauber, which has brought in Nico Hulkenberg from Force India as a replacement. Perez has long been backed by Telmex owner Carlos Slim, the world's richest man and a backer that McLaren would dearly love on board. The switching of his investment has cast doubt over the future of Sauber's other driver this year, Japan's Kamui Kobayashi -- who has no major sponsor. Of his podiums in 2012, March's Malaysian race was arguably Perez's pinnacle to date, scything his way from 10th on the grid to come within a whisker of beating Ferrari's two-time world champion Fernando Alonso to the win, while he also finished second behind Hamilton at Monza in September. ""All my podiums were equally great,"" he says, ""but I'm disappointed I've not had a win. I want to win at Sauber before leaving. ""Sauber has become like a family to me and it's always hard to leave your family. But I have a new family to go to and there comes a point when you have to move up to a new challenge. It will be great to join a new team, to have a new experience."" Before the move, though, Perez feels like he has unfinished business in the season's final two races. ""I still want to give everything until the last lap of the last lap,"" he says. ""I want to give everything I can.""","Formula One driver Sergio Perez looking forward to his ""home"" race in Texas on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- The judicial equivalent of white smoke has risen: The Supreme Court has ruled in a split decision rejecting most of Arizona's controversial immigration policing law, SB 1070. Many were expecting a tough ruling favoring the Arizona statute and opening the floodgates to states' rights. And so the majority opinion is surprising as it upholds the federal government's power in setting immigration policy, leaving less room than many anticipated for state immigration enforcement. Decision and issues at a glance . The justices upheld the provision of most concern to immigrant rights advocates, requiring police to check the immigration status of people they stop for other reasons if the officers suspect that they are in the country illegally. But even that part of the opinion is tenuous, and it's far from certain what will happen next. Maybe it's a coincidence, but the court's hesitance to open the door to more state immigration enforcement is consistent with a new mood emerging in the states and nationally. Winners, losers in immigration policy debate? The past six years saw a federalist revolution in immigration lawmaking, with states taking more power into their own hands every year. But the mood in most state houses was strikingly different this spring, with lawmakers much less focused on immigration and in much less of a hurry to crack down. Read the immigration ruling (PDF) According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, state lawmakers considered far fewer bills mentioning immigration: Halfway through the legislative sessions, in March, the number was down by 44%. Only two or three states seriously considered far-reaching enforcement measures, and no state enacted a new law. (Alabama revised an existing law, mostly softening it.) Most surprising, no state took advantage of the opening created by last year's Supreme Court immigration decision, the ruling that states may act to prevent and punish the hiring of unauthorized immigrants, requiring employers to enroll in the federal E-Verify worker identification program. Most observers expected that ruling too to encourage a host of imitators. In fact, nothing happened; not a single state enacted a law mandating E-Verify for any new employers. Opinion: An incomplete win for Obama? Developments in recent weeks suggest that the public's views, too, may be shifting. President Obama's surprise announcement that immigration authorities will not deport up to a million young people brought to the country illegally as children has met with an astonishing reaction: approval by voters and acquiescence, if not support, among Republicans. Neither Mitt Romney nor GOP leaders in Congress have denounced the order. A poll by Bloomberg News found that nearly two-thirds of the public are in favor. And some courageous Republicans -- including influential former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour -- have endorsed the policy, if not the way it was issued, by partisan fiat. It's no secret what's behind this jockeying, by Democrats or Republicans: the outsized role the Latino vote is likely to play in November, determining the outcome in several swing states and perhaps the next president. But as significant in the past week has been the broader public's easy acceptance of the Obama order, a new climate already creating new room to maneuver in Congress. Supreme Court mostly rejects Arizona immigration law; gov says 'heart' remains . The fight over who should make immigration law, Washington or the states, is far from over. But today's ruling, seemingly consistent with a new mood taking hold nationwide, is a stunning reversal of recent trends. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tamar Jacoby.","Tamar Jacoby: Many expected court to favor Arizona law .

"Washington (CNN) -- Federal aviation officials are telling airline and airport executives that they are working to minimize any disruption from imminent government budget cuts to passenger airline service, but warn the mandatory belt-tightening will impact air traffic overall. At a meeting in Washington on Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would give priority to 77 ""core"" facilities -- large airports and their related air traffic control centers, which it did not identify. But the agency would reduce staffing system wide and would likely close 238 control towers at less busy airports. Those towers handle 5.8 percent of all commercial air traffic, the FAA said. Opinion: Cuts too deep? No, not deep enough . ""It was clear at the meeting that the brunt of the cuts were at the cost of general aviation (private and business aircraft), and the agency even recognized that,"" said Melissa Rudinger of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, a group representing private pilots in Washington. The Transportation Department faces about $1 billion in budget cuts through the end of the fiscal year unless Congress acts by Friday to avert them. The cuts are part of a political impasse affecting spending across the government. Much of the agency's austerity will hit the FAA, which employs about 15,000 controllers and oversees traffic at more than 400 airports used by commercial airlines, business jets and private pilots. Large airports will also be impacted. All FAA employees have been told they may be furloughed at least one day every two weeks, inevitably meaning that aviation facilities will have fewer controllers. While the cuts would inevitably reduce the number of operations -- take-offs and landings -- the FAA said it would maintain the highest level of safety. The impact would be greatest at the nation's small- and mid-sized airfields, the FAA acknowledged. The 238 control towers facing possible closure met a criteria established by the FAA: They have fewer than 150,000 operations a year and fewer than 10,000 commercial airline operations. Opinion: Cuts will turn off voters GOP is courting . Of those towers, 189 are ""contact towers,"" operated under FAA supervision by independent contractors. The remaining 49 are staffed by FAA controllers. FAA officials said it would consider removing a tower on a case-by-case basis if advocates could justify a change. But any towers spared from closure would have to be off-set by cuts elsewhere, they said. Most of the changes would occur at the start of April, and would ratchet up over a period of months. The first furloughs would begin April 8, according to a meeting participant. If a tower is closed, operations at those airports would continue. But controller operations would be shifted to other facilities, or to the pilots themselves, who would radio their intentions to take off, land, and maneuver on the ground. Ground operations could present the biggest danger to pilots, since it would remove from service controllers who are trained to look for conflicting movements on the runways and taxiways. Critics say the FAA failed to consider important factors when compiling its list of towers, including whether the towers were also used for military operations and for search and rescue missions. FAA officials also said Tuesday it would suspend development of its NextGen navigation system so it could reassign employees to control towers. And it would suspend its redesign of airspace -- an ongoing program to make the area around airports more efficient. The FAA also said budget cuts would force it to cut back on maintenance and repairs at ""non-core"" facilities. Only power, voice and navigational systems would be fixed at those facilities, the FAA told the industry executives. Rudinger said while the FAA disclosed a few new details about its plans to deal with forced spending cuts -- known in Washington as sequestration -- it was ""certainly not as much detail as we were looking for going into the meeting."" Participants in the meeting questioned whether the FAA is making the smartest cuts. ''Clearly they have to make the cuts,"" Rudinger said. ""What's unclear is how they came up with them. There hasn't been any transparency in the process."" More spin than solutions as spending cuts near .","The Federal Aviation Administration met with airline and airport executives .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods won his 75th PGA Tour title at the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines on Monday to ensure his 2013 season started in fine fashion. After fog had taken the California tournament into a fifth day, Woods finished 14-under 274 to win the $6.1 million event by four shots. It was the 23rd time he has won by such a margin or more on the U.S. circuit and was his record eighth victory at the course, where he also claimed the last of his 14 majors in 2008. No other player has won more times at any venue. It took the American to within seven victories of Sam Snead's record tally of 82. Combined with his seven wins apiece at both Firestone Country Club and Bay Hill Club and Lodge, 22 of Woods' 75 career wins have now come at just three courses. This represents a significant 29 percent of the 37-year-old's tally of PGA Tour wins. ""This is a nice way to start the year,"" Woods said after the victory. ""My expectations for the year are the same -- to go out there and win every tournament I play in. ""Setting my sights on being No.1 comes as a result of winning golf tournaments and being consistent. ""That's how I got there and in order for me to get back there, that's what I have to do -- and this is a good start."" Starting the day six strokes clear, the world No. 2 carded a level-par 72 in his final round to finish ahead of defending champion Brandt Snedeker and Josh Teater, who were both 10-under. Resuming play on Monday with 11 holes remaining, Woods had to wait until the 13th hole for his first birdie of the day but his game then dropped off as a slow finish prompted some loose strokes. ""I lost a little bit of patience out there and unfortunately it affected my play a little bit,"" added Woods. Two bogeys and a double bogey between the 14th and the 17th took some of the shine off his victory and allowed Snedeker and Teater to narrow the gap. Fellow Americans Jimmy Walker and Nick Watney finished joint fourth on 279, while Australia's Aaron Baddeley was in a group tied for sixth another shot back. Baddeley's compatriot Jason Day was tied for ninth on 281 in a group including South Korean veteran K.J. Choi plus Canadians Graham DeLaet and Brad Fritsch.","Tiger Woods claims 75th PGA tour title at Torrey Pines .

"Washington (CNN) -- Both sides agree that forced spending cuts set to take effect next week will harm the economy and national security. Both sides have plans for averting the worst impacts. So why are there no formal negotiations taking place with Congress on break this week as leaders from both parties accuse each other of intransigence? Once again, the answer is the Washington blame game. The same pattern of politically inspired brinksmanship that dominated President Barack Obama's first term is continuing in the early days of his second. Now, the collective weight of Obama's re-election in November and the subsequent fiscal cliff deal in which Republicans conceded on tax increases makes compromise seem distant, if not impossible, in the short term. The central issue is the same one that framed last year's presidential campaign. Republicans want to shrink the size of government and the spending needed to run it, while Democrats want to strengthen the safety net of federal programs that help the poor, the elderly, the disabled and other vulnerable communities. Obama and leaders of both parties warn the pending $85 billion in spending cuts set to kick in on March 1 bode ill for the nation, but the rhetoric so far has focused on blaming the other side. In an interview on Thursday with the radio program ""Keepin It Real with Al Sharpton,"" Obama said GOP opposition to any further tax hikes or ending loopholes to raise more tax revenue was ""the thing that binds their party together at this point."" ""Unfortunately, I think Republicans have been so dug-in on this notion of never raising taxes that it becomes difficult for them to see an obvious answer right in front of them,"" the president said. ""We continue to reach out to the Republicans and say, 'this is not gonna be good for the economy, it's not gonna be good for ordinary people' but I don't know if they are going to move and that's what we are going to have to try to keep pushing over the next seven, eight days,"" Obama said. In an opinion piece published Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal, House Speaker John Boehner labeled the spending cuts ""ugly and dangerous,"" saying they would diminish resources for the military, law enforcement, border security, aviation safety and other programs. However, the de facto GOP leader on the issue argued that his party's agreement to raise tax rates on top income earners in January ended the discussion on further tax or revenue increases now. Instead, Boehner said he wanted other cuts to replace the across-the-board approach of sequestration, accusing Obama and Democrats of ignoring what he called the nation's spending problem. ""The president got his higher taxes"" with no spending cuts in the January deal, he wrote in the op-ed, adding that ""no one should be talking about raising taxes"" with examples of rampant government spending such as ""paying people to play video games, giving folks free cell phones and buying $47,000 cigarette smoking machines."" Voters in November returned Obama to office and gave Democrats a stronger Senate majority while reducing the Republican majority in the House, leading to the January agreement on the fiscal cliff by the outgoing Congress in its final hours. That deal raised tax rates on families earning more than $450,000 and individuals earning above $400,000 while maintaining lower rates for everyone else. It also put off until March 1 the mandated spending cuts from a 2011 agreement that increased how much money the Treasury could borrow to meet financial obligations. Known in Washington jargon as sequestration, the forced spending cuts to the military and other government agencies -- but not entitlement programs that drive chronic federal deficits -- were intended to motivate Congress to come up with a comprehensive deficit-reduction plan sought by both sides. Obama more emotional on spending cuts . However, such an agreement proved impossible in the hyper-political climate of an election year, and the government-wide cuts opposed by both sides now are set to take effect. That would mean $85 billion in cuts for the rest of fiscal year 2013, which ends September 30, as part of a 10-year total of about $1 trillion. Obama and Democrats are offering the same approach to the issue as a central theme of the election, calling for the wealthy to pay more as part of a package of spending cuts and increased revenue to replace the forced cuts of sequestration. Ratcheting up pressure on Republicans with Congress in recess for Presidents Day week, White House spokesman Jay Carney announced Thursday that Obama had phoned Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. He provided no details beyond describing the calls as ""good conversations."" Both Boehner and McConnell have complained that Obama refuses to address needed spending cuts and entitlement reforms to bring about substantive deficit reduction, and the timing of the phone calls appeared in response to questions about a lack of formal talks involving the president. A $110 billion proposal by Senate Democrats, which is similar to a plan by House Democrats, would replace the forced spending cuts for a year by getting more tax revenue from millionaires, stopping some agriculture subsidies and cutting military spending after the end of combat operations in Afghanistan in 2014. ""You may not like what we've proposed but at least let us have a vote in the House of Representatives,"" Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said Thursday in criticizing congressional Republicans. ""Come back here, call the Congress into session in the next eight days and let's have a vote. If you want to vote no and say you prefer the consequences of the sequester to the alternative ... that's your right."" On Tuesday, Obama held a campaign-style event at the White House to call for balancing the impact of deficit reduction so that the middle class and vulnerable citizens such as the elderly don't get hit too hard. Speaking in near apocalyptic terms, the president warned of criminals going free, longer security lines at airports, reduced military readiness, fewer border guards, pre-schoolers losing access to Head Start programs and other problems if the full brunt of the spending cuts occur. Where you'll feel forced spending cuts . GOP leaders, meanwhile, seek to blame Obama for the forced spending cuts so that any hardships that result, such as predicted job losses and reductions in economic growth, get attributed to the president. ""The president's sequester is the wrong way to reduce the deficit, but it is here to stay until Washington Democrats get serious about cutting spending,"" wrote Boehner, R-Ohio, in the op-ed. ""The government simply cannot keep delaying the inevitable and spending money it doesn't have. So, as the president's outrage about the sequester grows in coming days, Republicans have a simple response: Mr. President, we agree that your sequester is bad policy. What spending are you willing to cut to replace it?"" Congress passive as spending cuts near . By using language such as ""the president's sequester,"" Boehner and Republicans want to implant a public perception that the plan was Obama's all along. The White House concedes that it raised the idea of forced budget cuts during the negotiations in 2011 on the debt ceiling deal, but argues Republicans, including Boehner and other House leaders, agreed to making it part of the deal and then voted for it. Now, Carney says, Republicans acted like they never supported the idea. He insisted Thursday that Obama has offered the only legitimate compromise proposal for significant deficit reduction, noting the Congressional Budget Office determined the president's plan would bring deficits below 3% of gross domestic product by 2015, which he called an accepted target by economists. Carney labeled any comparisons between what Obama proposes and the Republican stance as a ""false equivalence,"" arguing the president's approach of spending cuts, entitlement reforms and new tax revenue is a compromise from a hard-line Democratic position that rejects any benefit reductions in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. ""You come half way and your negotiating partner stays where he or she is, that makes it very difficult to reach a compromise,"" Carney told reporters. ""You need compromise from the other side."" In negotiations last December on the fiscal cliff agreement, Obama was willing to include a less generous inflation index for benefits such as Social Security, despite vehement protests from his liberal base, Carney noted. ""There's some responsibility here on the Republican side to do what the president has done, which is to hear what the American people are saying, which is please compromise, please be reasonable, please do not adopt positions that represent a 'my way or the highway' approach,"" Carney said. Obama, Republicans clash on forced spending cuts . On Wednesday, Carney defended Obama's campaign-style approach to generating public support for his stance on the issue, saying such pressure worked in the spending and deficit agreements of the past two years. ""You know why they happened? Because the American people supported those positions that the president took,"" Carney said. ""And, in the end, Congress responded to the will of the American people. And we hope that's what's going to happen again this time."" A new poll on Thursday showed a strong majority of Americans want the kind of comprehensive deficit reduction called for by Obama, but support for a stop-gap measure on the forced spending cuts was less certain. Seven of 10 respondents in the Pew Research and USA Today survey called major legislation to reduce the deficit the most important priority for Congress, and 76% backed the combination of spending cuts and revenue increases favored by the president and Democrats. At the same time, 73% want more spending cuts than tax increases while only about 20% say the solution should be spending cuts alone. If the forced spending cuts go into effect, 49% of respondents would blame Republicans in Congress while 31% would blame Obama, the poll showed. However, 49% said the cuts should be delayed while 40% said they should go into effect.

"(CNN) -- It was a winter weather tale as old as, well, modern time: car vs. the snow plow. ""There's our friend and our nemesis, the plow. Ugh,"" said David Bradley, whose car was buried Wednesday by a plow clearing streets in Toronto. Forty-five minutes later, he was still trying to dig out his car from a fierce snowstorm that paralyzed parts of the United States and Canada, leaving hundreds of thousands without power and stranding thousands more. Similar scenes were playing from Wisconsin to Michigan, from Kansas to Texas, as thousands began digging out from a storm that began Sunday as a blizzard in the Great Plains. By Wednesday, it was a significant snowmaker over the Midwest and New England, causing headaches for some commuters. Warming climate could mean bigger blizzards, less snow . Deaths and destruction . The storm's toll was still being tallied in deaths and damage as remnants of the storm hit portions of New Hampshire and Maine early Thursday morning. A winter storm warning was in effect until 5 p.m. ET, with up to 10 inches of snow in the interior regions of Maine and eastern New Hampshire, according to the National Weather Service. As it marched on, officials said at least seven people were killed. In hard-hit Kansas, there were at least six storm-related deaths: two siblings who died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator, three people in fatal vehicle accidents and an elderly woman who died of hypothermia sweeping snow off her steps, Gov. Sam Brownback said. A seventh person died when a roof collapsed in hard-hit Woodward, Oklahoma, Mayor Roscoe Hill said. At the height of the storm, about 100,000 Kansas City Power and Light customers were without power, the company said. But Wednesday, roughly 10,000 were without power. A snow emergency was declared in Milwaukee through Thursday morning to keep cars from parking on zones where snow plows and emergency vehicles take priority. Up to 17 inches of snow fell in portions of Milwaukee. In the dark, Simon Alcarac was shoveling snow, trying to meet Milwaukee's 11 p.m. deadline to move his car to a nearby elementary school parking lot or face a hefty tow bill from the city. ""I prefer to go walk two blocks, three blocks than pay $200 to get it out"" of impound, he told CNN affiliate WTMJ-TV. A number of school districts, senior centers and churches in New Hampshire and Maine were closed Thursday, while some school districts in Kansas, Illinois and Michigan remained closed. Travel troubles . Airlines were rebooking passengers in Chicago late Wednesday after the snow forced the delay or cancellation of more than 100 flights, according to the airport. The storm was making itself felt on air travel in the Northeast on Wednesday evening, where airports in Boston, New York, New Jersey and Philadelphia were all showing delays. At LaGuardia Airport in New York, the FAA said departing flights were delayed by as much as an hour and 28 minutes. Airlines called off about 500 U.S. flights Wednesday, according to flight tracking website FlightAware.com. The website doesn't distinguish, however, the reason for each cancellation. Cleaning up . In Chicago, Willie Johnson advised caution when clearing heavy, wet snow off sidewalks and driveways. ""Take your time because this kind of snow they call heart-attack makers,"" he told CNN affiliate WLS-TV. ""I mean, it will kill you."" Others left the shoveling for later, opting instead to break out the sleds. ""I love it,"" said John Harris, grinning from ear to ear in his Notre Dame stocking cap. ""This is Chicago. This is what it should be like."" In Texas, some people had to resort to unconventional tools to get the job done. CNN iReporter Julie Swift of Plainview, Texas -- where 2 or 3 inches fell -- said she used a plastic school chair. ""The guy was shoveling next door for an older lady. I thought he had a real shovel,"" she said. ""But he had a lid to a big plastic tub. That was funny."" Outside Bradley's Toronto house, the din of shovel hitting concrete broke the early morning quiet. ""I have not made tremendous progress,"" said Bradley, an elementary school hall monitor. ""I'm almost to my car."" CNN's Steve Almasy and Tina Burnside contributed to this report.","A winter storm warning is in effect in portions of Maine and New Hampshire .

"(CNN) -- The detectives knew who abducted 5-year-old Richard Wayne Landers Jr. in 1994. His paternal grandparents, reportedly angry about a custody case involving the small boy, took him and disappeared from Indiana. For 19 years, Indiana State Police searched for him, but it was last October when the missing boy case turned into one of changed identities. According to a news release on the state police website, a detective was given Landers' Social Security card. He matched it to a 24-year-old man in central Minnesota about 100 miles from Minneapolis. Police looked at the man's driver's license photo. It could be him, they thought, comparing it to the photo of Landers as a boy. Some months of detective work followed and police found the grandparents, who they say admitted to assuming new names, in a town near Landers, who has been living under a name given to him by his grandparents. Landers is married with a child on the way. It is unclear when he will be reunited with his mother, Lisa Harter, and her husband. Charges in Indiana against the grandparents were dropped in 2008. A spokesman with the Indiana State Police said the FBI and Social Security Administration also were investigating the case.

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States has signed a deal with the central Africa nation of Niger that allows deployment of surveillance drones to keep tabs on Islamic militants in the region, officials from both countries said Tuesday. Niger is next door to Mali, where France joined the fight against Islamic rebels earlier this month . Pentagon spokesman George Little said the role of the U.S. military in Niger ""has not yet been defined"" -- but Niger's ambassador to the United States, Maman Sidikou, told CNN that his government has agreed to let U.S. drones operate from its territory. Sidikou said his understanding of the agreement is the drones will be unarmed and used for surveillance to monitor extremist movements. He refused to discuss where in the country the drones would be based or when they will be operational. Niger lies to the east of Mali, where French troops and warplanes are fighting alongside government troops to push back Islamist fighters who seized much of the former French colony in 2012. The rebels took advantage of the chaos that followed a revolt by Touareg separatists and a military coup, and banned music, smoking, drinking and watching televised sports in the territories under their control. Washington is backing its NATO ally by sharing intelligence, flying French troops to neighboring countries and refueling French jets. Mali is the home of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the North African offshoot of the terrorist movement. The group has been connected to the recent assault on the natural gas facility in Algiers and the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. Little said the group does not pose a direct threat to the U.S. homeland, but that could change. ""I'm unaware of any specific or credible information at this time that points to an AQIM threat against the homeland, but, again, I'm not ruling it out,"" he said. ""We take al Qaeda, wherever they are, very seriously. We are not going to rest on our laurels until we find that that kind of specific and credible information."" A U.S. official said that intelligence-gathering in that part of Africa is a challenge. The United States has a drone base in Djibouti, at the southern tip of the Red Sea -- on the opposite side of the continent from Mali. ""Djibouti is a long way from Bamako, and there's certainly a growing need for intelligence-gathering,"" the official said. While not confirming the reports about establishing a drone base, the official noted that if one was created, the operation would need infrastructure, security and support. CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","Niger says it's agreed to let U.S. drones operate from its territory .

"(CNN) -- Philippine President Benigno Aquino III ordered a group of Muslim rebels to surrender Saturday after an ongoing standoff led to bloodshed. ""From the very start, our objective has been to avoid the loss of lives and the shedding of blood,"" Aquino said in a statement Saturday. ""If you have grievances, the path you chose was wrong. The just, and indeed, the only correct thing for you to do is to surrender."" The peculiar standoff, which started in February on Borneo between Malaysian security forces and a group of men from the southern Philippines, has its roots in a recent landmark peace deal between Manila and Muslim rebels, according to experts on the region. More than 100 men from the mainly Muslim southern Philippines came ashore in the Malaysian state of Sabah on Borneo, demanding to be recognized as representatives of a sultanate that has historical claims on the area. Their claims touch on an unresolved territorial question between the Philippines and Malaysia, as well as Manila's efforts to improve relations with Islamic insurgents in the country's south after decades of violence. Malaysian police and armed forces soon surrounded the village in the eastern Sabah district of Lahad Datu, where the men had gathered. Police officials said they were negotiating with the group in an effort to persuade its members to return to their homes in the Philippines peacefully. Ten to 12 of the gunmen, and two Malaysian commandos were killed in clashes in the area,the official Philippines News Agency reported. CNN's Jennifer Deaton contributed to this report.","More than 100 Filipinos arrived by boat on the Malaysian coast in February .

"Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington (CNN) -- For three weeks, security fears kept U.S. authorities from searching the Afghan village where an American soldier is accused of killing 16 Afghans, an Army investigator testified Wednesday. Local tempers were so high over the killings that it was too dangerous for the Americans to go, said Matthew Hoffman, a special agent with the Army Criminal Investigation Command. Negotiations with local leaders over the issue took 20 days -- and even then, the investigators were guarded by U.S. and Afghan troops and watched over by two U.S. helicopters, he said. ""We were fully expecting to be attacked at any time,"" Hoffman said. ""We didn't know how much time we had for our investigation."" Hoffman's testimony came during an Article 32 hearing for Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, the soldier charged in the killings. The hearing at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, near Tacoma, Washington, will determine whether Bales will face trial for the deaths. Hoffman was the lead investigator in the case. His team collected blood samples, took photographs and found a number of 9mm shells at the site, but much of the evidence had been collected by Afghan troops the day after the March 11 killings, he said. The shooting spree near a small U.S. outpost in Afghanistan's Kandahar province last March strained already tense U.S.-Afghan relations and intensified a debate about whether to pull out American troops ahead of their planned 2014 withdrawal. Stunned friends recall good deeds of killing suspect . Bales is charged with 16 counts of premeditated murder, six counts of attempted murder, seven counts of assault and the illicit use of alcohol and steroids. He could be sentenced to death if convicted. Another investigator, Trayce Lang, testified Wednesday that she found steroids hidden outside Bales' quarters. The sergeant's lawyer, John Henry Browne, has said that steroid use will be a key factor in Bales' defense. Bales served three tours of duty in Iraq before being sent to Afghanistan and may have been suffering post-traumatic stress disorder, Browne said. Bales suffered a traumatic brain injury during a roadside bomb explosion and lost part of his foot in separate tours in Iraq, he said. Afghan villagers describe slaying's horror . The Army has said Bales is the sole suspect in the killings, but Afghan villagers in the area have consistently rejected the contention that Bales acted alone. Earlier this week, a fellow soldier testified that he and another soldier had been drinking with Bales hours before the attack. An officer, Capt. Daniel Fields, said that when he asked Bales after he surrendered what had happened, Bales replied, ""I'm sorry I let you down."" Wartime stress as a defense for murder .","Army Sgt.

"(CNN) -- A federal judge on Friday gave final approval to a settlement between BP and as many as 100,000 plaintiffs who allege they were sickened or injured by the 2010 Gulf oil disaster. The medical settlement, which covers clean-up workers and residents who lived within a certain area of the spill zone, provides medical compensation and consultation and a health outreach program. ""Without a settlement, Plaintiffs face significant further expenses in time, money, and resources -- with no assurance of recovery,"" U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier wrote in his ruling, which did not list the amount of compensation. Geoff Morrell, a spokesman for BP, said the company is ""pleased"" with the settlement. ""These settlements are historic resolutions that avoid years of lengthy litigation, and today's decision by the Court represents yet another critical step forward for BP in meeting its commitment to economic and environmental restoration efforts in the Gulf and in eliminating legal risk facing the company,"" he said in a statement. The oil spill -- the worst in U.S. history -- began after a rig explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf. Eleven workers died. Roughly 205 million gallons of oil spewed into the sea for nearly three months before a cap was placed on the BP-owned Macondo well, nearly a mile beneath the surface.

"(CNN) -- President Obama's poignant speech at Sunday's interfaith vigil in Newtown, Connecticut, set the tone for our mourning. Now, America's path forward will be decided out of the spotlight. The question of whether the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School will linger only in memory or be memorialized by an enduring shift in gun policy can only be answered by the legislature. Incoming Judiciary Committee chair Sen. Diane Feinstein has announced she will introduce an enhanced assault weapons ban on the first day of the new Congress, but the fate of that legislation is in the hands of Vice President Joe Biden. Biden will reportedly lead the administration's political response. No politician could be better suited to the challenge of passing federal gun control legislation than Biden. Over the past four decades, Biden has been one of the most consistent and effective advocates of gun control and violence prevention legislation. In 1994, Biden shepherded the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act through the Senate, a near miracle six years in the making. After Biden wrote the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act in 1988, Republicans quickly filibustered, blocking the bill for four years. He steered ""the Biden crime bill"" through the lengthy filibuster by negotiating with Republicans and making revisions. ""Every single line in that bill was written with every single major Republican a part of it,"" Biden said in a September 12, 1994, interview on the Charlie Rose show. The Clinton administration and then-Sen. Biden repeatedly refused to make concessions that would have jeopardized the substance of the act, even after debate over the amendment we know as the federal assault weapons ban imperiled the entire bill. Instead of backing down, Biden took on Republican Sens. Phil Gramm and Orrin Hatch and faced opponents attacking the bill as taxpayer-funded ""dance lessons and midnight basketball for robbers and rapists."" France: Where fear and taboo control guns more than laws . Biden did not budge: ""Make no mistake, this is about guns, guns, guns."" The crime bill passed the Senate in November 1993. When the bill foundered in the House, Biden persevered. It reached President Clinton's desk thanks to an unexpected, eleventh-hour push from a ""Lost Battalion of Republicans"" led by Rep. Mike Castle of Delaware. He'd been swayed during a series of meetings with the House Speaker and other House Republicans, at which Biden was the only Senator in attendance. The resulting legislation banned the manufacture of 19 types of semi-automatic firearms and criminalized the possession of high-capacity magazines. The process taught a critical lesson: When otherwise ""pro-gun'"" lawmakers have to choose between a crime bill including a gun ban and inaction, it is more than possible for them to vote to protect Americans. Unfortunately, the assault weapons ban expired in 2004. Since then, numerous lawmakers, including Joe Biden, have tried and failed to get the ban renewed. Congress now has a rare opportunity to take new action on gun control. After Newtown, proponents of stricter gun legislation are backed by public opinion and bolstered by a surge of political support. The ""pro-gun"" wing of the GOP and the National Rifle Association remain silent even as their supporters are defecting publicly. Democratic Sens. Harry Reid and Joe Manchin, whose voting record earned them the NRA's ""top rating,"" have backed off their ""pro-gun"" positions and declared that ""everything must be on the table"" for legislative debate. The 31 pro-gun senators have not spoken since Friday's tragedy, signaling the possibility that some of them might be changing their minds on guns, too. Lawmakers are essentially being asked to consider an updated version of the 1994 assault weapons ban. On Sunday, Feinstein promised the legislation ""will ban the sale, the transfer, the importation and the possession"" of assault weapons and ban high-capacity magazines as well as ""clips of more than ten bullets."" Biden will likely support a new ban on assault weapons and push for improvements. His 2007 Crime Control and Prevention Act would not only have renewed the ban but required background checks for all gun purchases, closing the ""gun show loophole.'"" Biden has also called on Congress to address the relationship of mental illness to violence in the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings. Was your gun banned? The president cautioned Americans Sunday, saying ""no single law, no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world, or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society. But that can't be an excuse for inaction. Surely, we can do better than this."" In his first term, however, Obama practiced a policy of appeasement, failing to block the expansion of gun rights or promote gun control. To ensure Congress passes tough, comprehensive gun control laws rather than settling for a watered-down version, as with health care, Obama must let Biden lead. Why? Biden has distinguished himself as an adroit and effective statesman in both the legislative and the executive branches. The former six-term senator has a deft touch with moderate and conservative counterparts: in 2008, he eulogized Strom Thurmond. As vice president, he has spearheaded the implementation of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Moreover, Biden has a particular passion for protecting students and educators. His wife, Jill Biden, has been teaching for more than 30 years. The deaths of 20 first-graders and six adults compel all Americans as sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, uncles and aunts, to consult their moral compasses. Legislators face a greater responsibility: a moral imperative to pass any legislation that could possibly prevent a future Newtown, Aurora, Oak Creek or Blacksburg. Opinion: Gun violence is a national security issue . As Obama ministers to the American people and offers words of comfort, Biden must move lawmakers to action. In 1994, Biden warned his colleagues, ""we simply can't let the gun lobby deny to the American people the vital benefits in this bill."" Biden must once more appeal to Congress to enact gun control. If anyone can succeed in those chambers, it's Joe Biden.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- CNN readers had a mixture of admiration and disdain for ""Bob,"" the anonymous U.S. programmer who outsourced his work to a Chinese firm for one-fifth of his paycheck. The incident was investigated by Verizon after a client company noticed the firm's computer system was regularly being accessed from China. Investigators found the employee had ""physically FedExed his RSA token to China so that the third-party contractor could log-in under his credentials during the workday,"" according to Andrew Valentine, a senior forensic investigator for Verizon. ""This guy must have read the `4-Hour Workweek' book. He was doing exactly what the book recommends,"" wrote one CNN reader, a sentiment echoed elsewhere. ""Heard this on CNN this morning and thought the same exact thing -- he must be a Tim Ferriss fan!"" wrote a reader identified as Sarah Avayou. U.S. programmer outsources own job to China, surfs cat videos . Ferriss, however, isn't a fan of the tactics of ""Bob."" The author of the blockbuster time management book series -- which advocates personal outsourcing as part of his formula for earning more in less time -- said subterfuge and allowing someone unauthorized access to the company computers is not the way forward. ""Productivity should benefit the collective, not put it at risk,"" Ferriss told CNN by e-mail. ""As much as I love cat photos, creating security breaches isn't a good career move. It's also bad karma."" An average day for ""Bob"" included watching cat videos and logging into eBay and Facebook. He would then send an end-of-day report on the work he paid a company in Shenyang, China, to do for him. ""The 4-Hour Workweek is about maximizing your per-hour output -- increasing personal effectiveness. It's about creating abundance and not about screwing your employer,"" Ferriss said. ""This is why I work with some of the fastest growing start-ups in Silicon Valley (Evernote, Uber, etc.): they want maximal leverage."" Is there a way ""Bob"" could have done this without jeopardizing his job? ""If you want to structure a remote-work agreement, voluntarily work several consecutive Saturdays and measure your output increases (e.g. deals closed, client hours booked, etc.),"" Ferriss said. ""Use data and a logical argument to show your bosses that you can contribute more while being location-independent."" Ferriss also advises: ""If you want increased power and negotiating ability within your organization, increase your per-hour output. Focus on the 80/20 Rule: identifying the 20% of activities (also products/services) that produce 80% of the results you or your bosses want. ""Track (or create) metrics that allow your supervisors to measure your performance improvements and contributions,"" he said. Still, many readers admired the unknown -- and now unemployed -- programmer. ""It reminds me of a quote from 'The Night Of The Generals' that went something like 'What is admirable on a grand scale is abhorrent on a small scale',"" commented another CNN reader known as Davidji, referring to the 1967 movie about a Nazi murder investigation during World War II.

"(CNN) -- Baku has been a citadel amidst potentially destabilizing forces for centuries, routinely blasted by gale-force winds, seismic activity and positioned near one of the world's largest and most coveted oil reserves. But, having declared independence and with the establishment of a lucrative oil pipeline, Azerbaijan now has its sights set firmly on urban renewal in its capital. This year, the astonishing Flame Towers project was completed by global architecture giant HOK, creating a building that developers hoped would become an icon for Baku's coastal skyline. Texan-born Barry Hughes, Vice President of HOK, says building an ""icon"" is one of the most intimidating briefs for an architect. ""It's probably dangerous to try to do something iconic. The biggest challenge a designer faces is that blank sheet of paper,"" he says, ""and if you pile on the idea that you want something iconic ..."" UNESCO World Heritage: Historic buildings in peril . HOK ultimately created three flame-shaped towers, clad in orange and blue-tinted glass, encircling a honeycomb-roofed podium. This is Hughes' favorite building, although he is reluctant to take all of the credit. ""I feel guilty because I get to take a bow for the work of 150 people who worked on this project,"" he says. The towers' shape was inspired by the city's history of Zoroastrian fire worship and its ongoing connection with natural gas. ""The client absolutely latched onto the idea of the flame, and then it became an interesting conversation about how literal that would be."" View a hi-res gallery of Barry Hughes' favorite buildings . Whether your tower looks like a flame, or merely evokes the concept, comes down, it seems, to how much it flickers at the roof line, and Hughes says a dedicated team worked exclusively on refining the towers' quiffs. ""They had long conversations about that moment when a candle is burning, the gestural moment when it catches the wind. Somebody drew that a hundred times in the computer, and once that's drawn it gets passed through different programs, and the contractors have to further rationalize it."" Watch 'Great Buildings' on Connect the World . The towers posed numerous other challenges. They had to be weighted to withstand potential earthquakes, and parts needed to be constructed without the use of cranes, due to Baku's harsh winds. The site is large, but dense, containing offices, a hotel and residential apartments above a shopping mall, above a parking lot. ""Making all those spaces work in tandem was the biggest engineering challenge of all,"" Hughes admits. But, standing at the top of one tower shortly before the building was completed, Hughes found himself marveling at another unexpected feat. ""Rare is the place in the world where you can stand in one tower ... and have two other towers that seem to form a space that I wasn't clever enough to anticipate,"" he says. ""Maybe I was just drunk on the accomplishment but that space up there is really magical."" 'Marilyn Monroe' towers shape city's future . ""Somebody will have a hotel room or office where they'll look across and be part of those three objects in the sky and that, for me, is kind of spiritual."" The building Hughes most wishes he'd designed is the Notre Dame du Haut, a concrete Catholic chapel in Ronchamp, France, designed by Swiss-born architect Le Corbusier. Completed in 1954, long before the advent of computer-aided design, the chapel's roof and walls curve and slope in response to the hill on which they sit. Today, many architects would find such complexity impossible to execute without the aid of computer, Hughes says. ""Within the context of that period, I think it's really a piece of sculpture."" He particularly admires the approach to the chapel, which winds up a hill and past some trees. ""When I went there, it was one of those charmingly underdone things. That's true of a lot of Corbu's work -- you have to work to get there. That processional route is special and comes from Corbusier looking at the Parthenon."" Hughes believes the inflection of humanity in Corbusier's work is what makes him relevant today. ""Modernists were really fascinated with the machine, and buildings as machines for living. I find that idea compelling but at the same time, machines can be soulless, and we're now in an age where we expect our machines to have a little spirit,"" he said. ""Corbusier was starting to do that in his later work. Mid-Corbusier was very angular, but Ronchamp is more gestural and evocative. You walk up and go 'oh, wow!' You get that lump in your throat. Which goes back to what everybody's trying to do when they start with that blank sheet of paper."" CNN's special coverage sometimes carries sponsorship. CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy .","Texas-born architect Barry Hughes picks the Flame Towers in Baku as his favorite building .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Dancing in public is not allowed in Iran, but thousands could hardly contain themselves at a recent presidential campaign rally in the capital city, Tehran. Supporters hope Zahra Rahnavard will become Iran's future first lady. On this day, the deafening cheers were not for presidential hopeful Mir Hossein Mousavi, but rather for his wife -- a woman some are calling Iran's Michelle Obama. The comparisons to the first lady of the United States stem from the role Zahra Rahnavard is playing in her husband's quest for the presidency. Never in the history of Iranian presidential elections has a candidate put his wife in the forefront of his campaign. Wherever Mousavi -- a centrist candidate -- goes, Rahnavard is usually nearby.  Watch more about Zahra Rahnavard » . ""We look at her and we say, 'we want to be like her in the future, ' "" said Shakiba Shakerhosseie, one of 12,000 people who packed into Tehran's indoor Azadi (Freedom) sports stadium to hear Rahnavard speak. Iran became an Islamic republic in 1979 after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was forced into exile. The revolution also ended the ceremonial role of first lady that the last queen, Farah, enjoyed. At this rally, Rahnavard -- a writer and art professor -- spoke for her husband, who was campaigning elsewhere. Wearing a floral headscarf and a traditional black chador -- a full-length loose robe that women in Iran wear like a cloak -- Rahnavard called for freedoms she says were lost during President Mahmoud Ahmadijenad's term. ""I hope freedom of speech, freedom of the pen and freedom of thought will not be forgotten,"" she said. The crowd, which was clad in Mousavi's trademark color green, cheered wildly. It waved placards with his picture and swayed from side to side, chanting and beating drums. The women sat on one side; the men on the other. The overwhelming majority were young voters, many of whom said they attended because of Mousavi's wife, a mother of three. Iran's population -- estimated at more than 66 million -- has a median age of 27. ""I am really angry here in Iran with the position of women,"" said Saghar Kouhestani, adding that she supports Mousavi because of his wife. Mousavi, a former prime minister, is considered a threat to Ahmadinejad, a hard-liner, in the June 12 elections. He is credited for successfully navigating the Iranian economy during a bloody eight-year war with Iraq in the 1980s. Over the weekend, the Iranian government blocked access to the social networking site Facebook, where Mousavi has a page with more than 5,000 supporters, the semi-official Iranian Labor News Agency (ILNA) said. Those attempting to visit Facebook received a message in Farsi saying, ""Access to this site is not possible."" Political science professor Mohammad Marandi downplays Rahnavard's impact. She may win over reformists and women, he says, but what will win the election is a solution to the floundering economy and a strong performance in the debates. ""If Ahmadinejad does well in the debates, I don't think anyone will be able to defeat him,"" Marandi said. But try selling that to Rahnavard's enthusiastic supporters. ""This is the first time after the Revolution we see a lady behind the president,"" said Farhad Mahmoudi. ""And this is why we're so happy because we can have a first lady.""","Wife of presidential hopeful Mir Hossein Mousavi generates huge crowds .

"(CNN) -- The New York Times' acknowledgment in its Thursday editions that Chinese hackers carried out sustained attacks on its computer systems should be a wake-up call to any company around the world that trades in information, according to computer security experts. ""When you're dealing with an adversary with significant resources like the Chinese -- or the United States, for that matter -- you need to take some pretty extreme steps,"" said Chris Soghoian, principal technologist for the American Civil Liberty Union's Speech Privacy and Technology Project. ""Off-the-shelf antivirus software is not going to be enough."" That's because consumer antivirus software from business-supply stores such as Staples will not protect computer owners from state-sponsored actors, he said. ""Staples, hopefully, will protect you from a scammer trying to steal your bank account, or a Russian criminal gang trying to put a key logger on your computer. There is no commercial software that is going to keep you safe from a determined government,"" Soghoian said. According to The Times, the cyberassaults took place over four months, beginning during an investigation by the newspaper into the wealth reportedly accumulated by relatives of the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that its computer systems also had been infiltrated by Chinese hackers. The hackers were monitoring the newspaper's China coverage, according to a written statement from Paula Keve, chief communications officer for parent company Dow Jones & Co. ""Evidence shows that infiltration efforts target the monitoring of the Journal's coverage of China, and are not an attempt to gain commercial advantage or to misappropriate customer information,"" it read. ""If you're a newspaper focusing on issues that are going to upset governments, then you need to invest in security as well,"" Soghoian said. Chinese authorities responded to the Times' reports on Wen's family members by blocking access to The Times' website in mainland China. The Times said that it had worked with computer security experts to monitor, study and then eject the attackers. It said that by following their movements, it aimed to ""erect better defenses to block them"" in the future. Experts: Chinese cyberattacks on West widespread . Such efforts are becoming more important as the incidence of hacking appears to grow, Soghoian said. ""The first thing you do is make sure that everything you have is encrypted both in storage or transmission,"" he said. That way, if a reporter leaves a laptop in a hotel room in Beijing and the police try to copy it while the reporter is out of the room, it is protected, he said. But such efforts are not cheap. ""You have to hire a bunch of internal security people,"" he said. ""But if you're the newspaper of record and you're talking to whistle-blowers who would go to jail or be tortured or arrested if they talked to you, then you need to take adequate steps."" The same message applies to any journalist who talks to sensitive sources, particularly in government, in the intelligence or defense communities, he said. ""Those journalists need to take real steps, take significant steps to shield the identities of their sources."" Soghoian said that, in his experience, few reporters appear to meet that standard. ""Most journalists don't know much about digital security,"" he said. ""The number of journalists that I communicate with using encrypted e-mails I can probably count on one hand. The number of journalists who would even know how to open an encrypted e-mail is not something to feel confident about."" Stories about China are not the only ones that reporters should be cautious about, said Peter Toren, a partner in the Washington law firm Weisbrod Matteis & Copley and a former prosecutor with the computer crime and intellectual property section of the Department of Justice. ""Certainly, if I'm writing a story that implicates somebody who is sophisticated in computer hacking, I would be concerned,"" said Toren, whose expertise includes the area of economic espionage. His feeling is that the incidence of such attacks is growing, but he acknowledged that it's impossible to quantify. ""You only really find out about it when people are caught, and a lot of organizations don't necessarily report the hacks or the successful intrusions because they don't want to be embarrassed."" Toren added, ""I think just the mere fact that the New York Times admits they were the victim of hacks is something new."" Law firms are also frequent targets because they tend to take fewer security precautions than do the companies they represent, ""and law firms are in possession of some important information,"" he said. In response, he said, the FBI met last year with security experts at some of New York's largest firms to help them beef up security. The threat extends to any organization in which information that is worth money is stored on computers -- ""which is just about every organization and every business,"" he said. Prosecutions for hacking are rare and almost impossible to win when an attack is launched from outside the United States, a fact that the hackers exploit, he said. ""It's just as easy to hack into an American computer from China as it is from Washington, D.C., given that there are no boundaries in cyberspace."" One reason companies can get into trouble is because employees are often easy to victimize, said Hemu Nigam, an Internet security analyst and founder and CEO of SSP Blue, which advises companies on Internet security. ""Your security is as good as your weakest link in the company,"" said Nigam, who is a former chief security officer of News Corp. All that's necessary to introduce malware into a company's computer system is for an employee to ""click on something that sounds exciting,"" he said. From a security perspective, companies tend to be good at blocking access to their computers through the main entryway, but they tend to do less well blocking other entries, Nigam said. ""Take a house -- you bolt the front door; somebody breaks in the back door; then they can go into every room of your house. Companies have to think about closing all the doors around the house and also put a bolt on every door in the house."" Finding vulnerabilities is not hard for experts, he said. ""Every single client we've had, we have successfully broken into their network to identify vulnerabilities, and helped them fix them."" News organizations tend to be among those with laxer security, he said. ""From a philosophical approach, it actually makes sense that they would find themselves open to an attack like this,"" he said, since news organizations, by their very nature, tend to be focused on open access to information. Countries have been using cyber methods to attack each other for at least 15 years, but that fact has only recently gained widespread attention, he said. ""People often say the Cold War has ended; the reality is the Cold War has gone digital."" But the Cold War of the last century rarely affected normal citizens or companies, and that is no longer the case, he said. ""Because of the way the world is now connected through the Internet, a regular company can find itself in the middle of Cold War activity, which tells us that every company out there ought to think of security as one of their No.1 activities. Otherwise, they risk becoming a pawn between two governments having a silent battle against each other."" The United States has its own powerful counterintelligence machine, and that should surprise no one, he said. ""If you have a country that knows how to use the power of the Internet and knows how to take advantage of counterintelligence activity through methods like hacking, they will certainly engage in it; otherwise, they will be left behind and they well become sitting ducks."" Asked about The Times' allegations on Thursday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that ""all such alleged attacks are groundless, irresponsible accusations lacking solid proof or reliable research results."" ""What else would you say?"" asked Nigam rhetorically. ""Of course, you have to say that. If the U.S. government were accused of something similar, the public relations machine would also say the exact same things."" China has been the victim of cyberattacks and ""has laws and regulations prohibiting such actions,"" the spokesman, Hong Lei, said at a regular news briefing. A separate statement from the Chinese Ministry of National Defense said the country's military ""has never supported any hacker activities."" On Thursday, it appeared that television censors in China were blacking out CNN's reporting of the hacking story. Chinese authorities have blacked out the broadcast signal for international television stations such as CNN and the BBC when they have aired sensitive reports about the country.","""You need to take some pretty extreme steps,"" ACLU expert says .

"(CNN) -- Hurricane Sandy gave the Eastern seaboard a real pounding this week, with heavy rain, widespread flooding and high winds. In addition to damage from water and wind, the East Coast is experiencing cascading effects of power outages and disrupted transportation systems. Downed power lines have led to fires and electrocutions. Widespread shutdowns of government and business operations are curtailing economic activity. More than 50 lives have been lost. It is too early to get an estimate of damages, but the economic costs will likely amount to billions or perhaps tens of billions of dollars. The element of risk is epitomized by the disabled boom of a construction crane, dangling 80 stories over the streets of Manhattan, an all-too-real sword of Damocles. Many of the areas buffeted by Sandy were hit by Hurricane Irene in August of 2011. What is going on? Is the punch from Sandy or the one-two pounding from Irene and then Sandy a consequence of climate change or an unlucky roll of the climate dice? The evidence is not yet in for the East Coast in 2011 and 2012, but the general trends are increasingly clear. In its 2012 report on managing the risks of extreme events and disasters, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that ""A changing climate leads to changes in the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and timing of extreme weather and climate events, and can result in unprecedented extreme weather and climate events."" Many observations and many lines of evidence support this conclusion. Yet, the fact that hurricanes and other climate extremes occur only rarely means that it is very difficult to know for sure that the recent pattern is really outside the range of historical variation. Globally, we don't have conclusive evidence that hurricanes are increasing, but we do see a clear indication that the major storm tracks outside the tropics are moving further from the equator. From the perspective of expected damages, two trends highlight causes for concern. First, economic losses from weather-related disasters have increased over the last several decades. This is mostly because of increases in the value of the assets in harm's way. Second, sea level is rising. Globally, sea level is now about 6 inches higher than in 1900. This may not sound like much, but a modest change can have big effects. Flooding from storm surge is a classic threshold event. If the waves are 1 inch below the top of the sea wall, there is no damage. One inch above leads to flooding. This combination of increasing exposure and increasing sea level is gradually notching up the level of risk. What can be done? For disaster managers, the long-standing foundations for effectiveness are preparation, response, and recovery. So far, disaster management agencies, from the local to the national level, have taken Sandy very seriously, appropriate for a storm of its magnitude. The tradition in disaster management has been to base planning on past experiences. That's a reasonable approach when the future looks basically like the past. But it is a recipe for regret when climate and development are changing. Much can be done to incorporate new knowledge into disaster management, including steps to reduce the risks of future disasters. One key is recognizing that the future won't be like the past. To cope with changes in climate, development and population, we should be building climate and sea level projections into infrastructure planning, building codes and plans for managing disasters. We have the scientific knowledge and engineering knowledge to improve all three phases of disaster risk reduction -- preparation, response and recovery. But we don't know everything. As a consequence, it is important to make learning by doing an integral part of disaster management. We need to continue to refine our understanding of the role of climate change in altering the risks, at the same time we test technologies and strategies for dealing with a future that we know will be different from the past. Climate change is occurring now. We see its consequences in hotter temperatures, higher sea levels and shifted storm tracks. In many parts of the world, we are also seeing an increase in the fraction of rainfall that comes in the heaviest events. When it rains, increasingly it pours. Climate change over the next couple of decades is already largely baked into the system, but changes beyond that are mostly in our hands. As we learn more about the links between climate change and extreme events, it will benefit all of us to think hard about the opportunities and challenges of getting a handle on climate change, so we control it and not vice versa.

"(CNN) -- When it comes to football players, there are very few who can be held up as respectable role models. All too often, players are criticized for their off-field behaviour, alleged racist remarks, outbursts on Twitter and end up gracing the front pages of newspapers for all the wrong reasons. Balotelli on the brink: Sink or swim for 'Super Mario'? But on a cold Friday night in South Wales with snow sweeping across the country, one football player really did make a difference. Angel Rangel, the Swansea City defender, who is an integral part of Michael Laudrup's side, had only left home to go for a sandwich with his wife, Nikki. Driving in hazardous wintry conditions, Rangel decided to make the journey to his local sandwich shop to have a bite to eat. It is there that Rangel takes up the story, telling CNN about his gesture as he drove through the city looking for people sleeping rough. He said: ""We went for something to eat in a local sandwich chain and overheard the manager saying they had to throw out bags of sandwiches as they were about to close for the night. ""My wife, Nikki, who is a very caring and charitable person, asked if we could have them for the homeless rather than see them thrown in the bin. ""They agreed and we drove around Swansea for over an hour, but couldn't find any homeless people as it was so cold out on the streets with all the snow. ""We decided to tweet a plea and we were guided to a local charity shelter who looked after the homeless."" Rodgers defends Liverpool's Suarez . That tweet, which went viral, was picked up by a local homeless shelter which invited the pair to the venue. After giving out sandwiches and talking to the group, Rangel joked he should have hit the kitchen to cook up some of his famous Spanish Omelette. He added: ""They were obviously grateful and after chatting to the charity worker it is something we are going to do on a regular basis. It's the least we can do, especially with it being so could outside at the moment. ""I don't know if we'll be as lucky with the free sandwiches in future, so I may have to cook some of my special Spanish omelettes instead!"" He later wrote on Twitter: ""Wow we r amazed at the amount of tweets we r receiving. Thanks a lot but it was just a little gesture we drove for only 1 hour and felt great."" Rangel stated that he did not want the name of the shelter publicly named. Rangel will now hope to put a smile on lots more Swansea City faces when he takes on Stoke City in the Premier League Saturday.","Angel Rangel, the Swansea City player, makes trip to homeless shelter .

"(CNN) -- There are ""a lot of scare tactics in play here,"" Steve Butler, protagonist of the new anti-hydraulic-fracturing film ""Promised Land,"" warns a local politician skeptical of the benefits of hydraulic fracturing. Played by Matt Damon, Butler is an earnest salesman for the energy giant Global Crosspower Solutions, bent on convincing a rural town in Pennsylvania that hydraulic fracturing will save its outdated agrarian economy from collapse. At first glance, Butler seems like a savior to the town, promising poor, unemployed farmers an economic renaissance. But he quickly becomes a villain -- a henchman of the big, bad corporation out to exploit the destitute and uninformed through bribes and get-rich-quick promises. That is, until a wizened old man (representing the film's voice of justice) stands up to Butler at a town meeting and exposes the alleged dangers of hydraulic fracturing that Butler was covering up. The town, taken aback, puts its hydraulic fracturing decision up for vote. Butler feels confident in his ability to persuade the town until an anti-fracking environmentalist named Dustin Noble appears on the scene. Noble is David taking on Goliath, saying he wants to stop Butler because Global's fracking allegedly destroyed his family's longstanding farm with water contamination. With charm and wit, Noble wins over the town and leaves Butler at the point of despair. But then the film takes an unexpected twist. I won't give away the film's ending, except to say that its anti-fracking message relies predominantly on -- to use Butler's own words -- scare tactics. Never once does the audience see hydraulic fracturing in action or even a well or the controversial wastewater. ""Promised Land"" lacks any substantive scientific evidence illustrating the alleged dangers of fracking. Obeidallah: Hollywood movies can (mis)educate us . Instead, the film falls back on many conventional anti-capitalist themes. The ""only reason you're here is 'cause we're poor,"" declares a farmer to Butler at one point. Of course, what the film does not explain is the incredible economic revolution that hydraulic fracturing has already brought to much of America. From 2008 to 2011, natural gas production in the U.S. has risen a staggering 10%, according to a recent report from the International Energy Agency. The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts U.S. natural gas production will increase 44% by 2040, thanks in large part to increased shale gas production made available by hydraulic fracturing. The energy boom is bringing jobs and increased tax revenues back to rural America and not just to the pockets of big energy companies, as Damon and his co-writers would have you believe. Inflation-adjusted income in America's rural areas is up 3.8% per person since 2007, while it has declined in urban areas. The unemployment rate in North Dakota, home of much of the Bakken shale reserves, is a stunningly low 3.1%. And contrary to Damon and company's screed, it's not all about the money. Many states, such as Texas and Oklahoma, use the tax revenues from oil and gas to fund state education projects, health care obligations and rainy-day funds. As to the controversy surrounding the environmental safety of hydraulic fracturing, ""Promised Land"" offers little credible, scientific evidence to illustrate the alleged dangers of hydraulic fracturing. It's worth noting -- because ""Promised Land"" does not -- the head of the Environmental Protection Administration, Lisa Jackson, is on record as saying, ""In no case have we made a definitive determination that the fracking process has caused chemicals to enter ground water."" Furthermore, Jackson said in February, ""(Fracking technology) is perfectly capable of being clean. It requires smart regulation, smart rules of the road."" A monumental energy revolution is under way in this country. And while industry leaders and politicians are debating the best way to effectively and safely bring the benefits of this revolution to millions of Americans, Damon and his colleagues instead aim to frighten the potential benefactors of this revolution. Clearly we cannot take this energy revolution for granted. ""Promised Land"" will not be the last of its kind. The public deserves to know the truth about America's energy potential. By freeing up more state and federal lands for drilling, cutting unnecessary, burdensome restrictions while protecting wells and ground water with safe and smart regulations, every American might soon get his own slice of the real promised land.

"Providence, Rhode Island (CNN) -- The hottest ticket in town these days is for the Who's Quadrophenia and More Tour concert on Tuesday night at the Dunkin' Donuts Center in downtown Providence, Rhode Island. It will be the first time Cathy Hedtler will see them live, and she's anxious. After all, The Who is her favorite band, and she purchased her ticket more than 33 years ago. ""I've waited a long time for this,"" she told CNN. Hedtler was 18 in December of 1979 when it was announced that The Who's Quadrophenia Tour would be coming to Rhode Island. The then teenager spent three days scouring ticket outlets and record stores to get her seat. Stephen Ball will also be at the concert Tuesday night. He's been waiting for this since his freshman year in college, when the self-described ""Who fanatic"" stood in line overnight outside of the Providence Civic Center (now the Dunkin' Donuts Center) for his two tickets; one for him and one for his date -- his kid sister Louise. ""I wrapped up the night shift at McDonald's and ran across the street to the Civic Center Box Office,"" he remembered. ""I spent all of the money I had -- $25."" The Who show was a big to-do in little Rhode Island; the concert was a sell-out. But The Who never showed up. Just weeks before the scheduled Rhode Island show, 11 fans were trampled to death at a Who concert in Cincinnati. It was an incident that forever altered festival style seating at rock concerts. In the aftermath, then-Providence Mayor Vincent '""Buddy"" Cianci, who oversaw the Providence Civic Center auditorium, canceled the show. His decision disappointed and enraged Who fans in Providence. ""I wanted (Mayor Cianci) impeached!"" Ball said. ""I cried for days,"" said Hedtler, who still bristles at the mere mention of the name Buddy Cianci. But even though Providence was the only show to be canceled after the tragedy, Cianci still stands by his decision. ""Did I take heat? Sure I did,"" the mayor-turned-talk show host told CNN. ""I got plenty of hate mail over it. But do I regret it? Not at all."" In the 33 years since the canceled show, The Who have never played a show in Rhode Island despite numerous overtures made by the arena, according to Dunkin' Donuts Center officials. They have, however, played more than a dozen times at numerous nearby venues in Massachusetts. But for those thinking that the reason for the decades-long absence from the Ocean State was due to a grudge against the arena or Cianci, think again. ""I think the mayor of Providence made an informed decision at the time,"" Who guitarist Pete Townshend said in a statement to CNN. ""It was based on what he knew."" Left heartbroken and bitter, Cathy Hedtler and Stephen Ball nevertheless always held onto those tickets. Ball, now a retired drill sergeant living in Virginia, kept his pair in a green shoe box that he took with him to the 16 places the Army moved him throughout his career. Cathy, now 51 and an accountant, kept hers in a scrapbook of news clippings about the tragedy in Cincinnati. When the Dunkin' Donuts Center announced last summer that The Who would finally be coming back, general manager Larry Lepore -- a former Providence cop who was coincidentally assigned to work the '79 show -- decided to right a 33-year-old wrong. Anyone with a ticket to the '79 show would be admitted. ""I think it's a wonderful gesture,"" Townshend told CNN. Turns out, Hedtler and Ball were not alone. Thirty-two tickets from 1979 with face values of $11.50 and $12.50 were exchanged for the $129.50 seats being sold today. One of those tickets belongs to Stephen Ball's sister, Louise. She was in the 11th-grade at the time of that canceled date with her brother and the Who. On Tuesday, she turns 50. Lepore says it would take a catastrophic act of God for the arena to cancel the show this time around, but Stephen Ball and Cathy Hedtler aren't taking any chances. And like that famous song by The Who, they're praying that they won't get fooled again.","Venue honors tickets for a Who concert scheduled more than 30 years ago .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea moved quickly to replace the sacked Roberto Di Matteo Wednesday as Rafael Benitez was appointed as interim manager until the end of the season. The English Premier League side made the announcement on their official website, just hours after the departure of Di Matteo, who had led them to European Champions League glory for the first time earlier this year. Former Valencia and Liverpool manager Benitez will be thrown in at the deep end, with Chelsea taking on EPL reigning champions and leaders Manchester City Sunday. ""The owner and the Board believe that in Benitez we have a manager with significant experience at the highest level of football, who can come in and immediately help deliver our objectives,"" read the club statement. ""The 52-year-old Spaniard is due to meet the players at the training ground in Cobham tomorrow (Thursday),"" it added. Benitez, who will be the ninth manager under owner Roman Abramovich, has been out of work since being sacked by Inter Milan in December 2010. He guided Valencia to two Spanish titles and the UEFA Cup and spent six years at Liverpool, highlighted by their Champions League triumph in 2005 and reaching the final in 2007. Former Barcelona manager Pepe Guardiola has been linked with the Chelsea job, but is currently on a year-long sabbatical after leaving the Catalan giants at the end of last season. Di Matteo, who also won the FA Cup with Chelsea during his brief spell in charge, paid the price for a poor recent run of results, culminating in a 3-0 defeat to Juventus Tuesday which leaves their participation in the knockout stages of this season's Champions League in considerable doubt.","Chelsea appoint Rafael Benitez as interim manager until end of the season .

"Washington (CNN) -- When House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi announced that she would seek to keep her leadership role she stood flanked by a cheering phalanx of her female colleagues. Pelosi, who prior to the Democratic Party's loss of the House in 2010 served as its first female speaker, sandwiched her announcement between pointed comments about the Democratic agenda and how she sees her party's policies as helpful to women. Pelosi said she would vie to keep her leadership role ""in order to continue work on empowering women."" But as even Democrats exult an election which saw, for the first time in history, women and minorities net the majority of House seats on their side of the aisle and a record 16 Democratic seats in the Senate, political experts warn against premature celebration. Pelosi to run again for Democratic leader . An increase in the number of women does not automatically translate into increased political power. Democrats may have been able to woo female voters and throw tremendous support behind getting women elected to office, but that ""doesn't mean that is how they govern,"" said Jennifer Lawless, director of the Women & Politics Institute at American University. ""Moving forward in the direction that will improve women's social, economic and political autonomy takes time,"" she said -- time and the type of power that House Democrats currently lack. New U.S. House: Women and minorities to the left; white men to the right . Democrats are the minority in the House and do not have control of that chamber's most powerful committees. That means they have far less control over the types of legislation that comes out of those committees. And even within the Democratic House caucus, women are far outnumbered and outranked on some of the most powerful committees. ""The most traditional measure (of political power) would be leadership positions, not just ranking positions on key committees but any membership on these committees,"" Lawless said. There is only one Democratic woman, Rep. Shelley Berkley of Nevada, on the powerful House Ways and Means committee, which oversees tax writing, revenue and entitlement programs. There are other male lawmakers ahead of her with seniority to serve as ranking member. The ranking Democrats on the Appropriations, Budget, Education and the Workforce and Energy and Commerce committees are also all men. New York Rep. Louise McIntosh Slaughter, one of the longest-serving women in Congress, is the ranking member on the House Rules Committee. While the Senate has a greater share of women in leadership positions, there are no Republican women in top leadership roles. There are also other questions of whether women indeed have an equal place at the political table, Lawless said. Lawless added that there are questions, like who is sponsoring significant pieces of legislation? Who are the most outspoken members regarding women's issues? Are women leading the discussions on the fiscal cliff? With their big political win, the new American electorate has arrived . Those questions will perhaps best be answered when the new Congress convenes in January. However, with such dramatic demographic and ideological differences in the House â€” women and minorities make up the majority on the left, white men are the majority on the right â€” Congress is likely headed for more partisan gridlock, said David Wasserman, House editor for the Cook Political Report. For example, ""It will be more difficult to pass a bill to address the debt,"" he said. The two parties and their newly remade majorities also will likely be at loggerheads on such issues as entitlement spending, immigration and health care reform, political experts say. In the upcoming policy debates, the Republican side of the aisle will find it tougher to utilize their dwindled female corps to reach out to their Democratic compatriots, political experts say. ""For Republican women it was a bad night,"" Michele Swers, a Georgetown University professor of American government, said of Election Night. In the House, a number of Republican women lost races including Saratoga Springs, Utah, Mayor Mia Love, a Mormon of Haitian descent and rising Republican Party star who was given a high-profile speaking role at the Republican National Convention in August. Others, such as tea party favorite and former presidential candidate Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota narrowly kept their seats. The majority of the Republican-held House seats are occupied by white men. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rogers of Washington, the GOP's top woman in the House, was elected Republican Conference Chairman on Wednesday, despite the fact that Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's running mate, threw his support behind Rep. Tom Price of Georgia. ""They're somewhat limited,"" Lawless said of the GOP leadership's ability to put forth women on key issues. ""Only 10% of the Republican Congress is women. To the extent they want to be inclusive, it's not as if there's dozens and dozens of women who can speak for them. The lack of numbers hurts.""","Democrats cheer gains of women, but experts say power is not yet among them .
There are few women in either party who hold key roles on powerful House committees .
True test will be increase in leadership roles, sponsoring legislation, political experts say ."
"Washington (CNN) -- If House Republicans have their way this summer, the Bush-era tax cuts would become permanent, ""Obamacare"" would begin to be dismantled and energy regulations would be rolled back. On Friday, House GOP leaders unveiled their summer agenda with an eye on the fall campaign, including those and other items that probably won't become law, but will highlight the party's message on the economy. In a memo to GOP members, Majority Leader Eric Cantor promised a vote on the most contentious issue --extending the Bush-era tax cuts that expire at the end of the year â€” before the House begins its monthlong summer break in August. Republican leaders have been mum on the details, but the measure is expected to renew the current rates for some period and lay out a framework for tax reform that lowers rates across the board. Many of the details, however, including which deductions would be eliminated, would be put off until next year. Cantor's memo says the House will focus in the coming months on ""addressing job creation and the economy, reducing spending and shrinking the size of the federal government while protecting and expanding liberty."" In addition to the tax issue, the majority of items Cantor cites for floor action -- votes to repeal portions of Obamacare, roll back ""job-inhibiting"" red tape and press for more domestic energy production -- will land with a thud in the Democrat-led Senate. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has made it clear that anything the GOP-led House passes dealing with taxes or deficit cuts is DOA in the Senate. With the November election five months away and almost zero motivation for bipartisan cooperation, the reality is that any major action will be postponed until after the election. The fiscal cliff . Another thorny issue facing Congress: how to deal with automatic spending cuts to federal agencies scheduled to go into effect in January as part of the budget deal last summer. Republicans in the House and Senate are pushing bills to fence off any impact on defense with deeper cuts to domestic programs. In a recent letter to GOP senators, Reid said the Republican line in the sand against new revenues means no deal on these issues can happen.""Unfortunately, it appears that Republicans' blind adherence to tea party extremism is making it impossible to reach this sort of balanced agreement before the election,"" Reid wrote. Cantor's memo leaves out how the House will deal with some lingering and politically charged issues before the election. Both Democrats and Republicans say they want to avoid interest rates on student loans doubling in July, but there is no agreement yet on how to pay for legislation to head off the increase. The House passed a bill targeting what the GOP says is a ""slush fund"" that pays for public health programs as part of the health care law. Democrats want to offset the costs with a tax on some businesses. After the Senate failed to pass either party's preferred plan, the standoff continues. Transportation, women, drugs, post office on agenda . While both chambers passed legislation -- the ""Violence Against Women Act"" -- that funds programs combating domestic abuse, the issue has become a political battle, with Democrats arguing GOP resistance to expanding protections to gays and lesbians and native Americans amounts to a ""war on women."" Republicans counter that Democrats hijacked the measure for political purposes and are picking a ""fake fight"" to appeal to female voters. House and Senate leaders are also still negotiating details on a multiyear transportation bill that gives states billions of dollars for new infrastructure projects. But both sides are tangling over how long to authorize the federal program and the GOP's insistence that the bill include authorization for the Keystone pipeline that would transport oil from Canada down to the Gulf of Mexico. There are some areas where bipartisan action is expected. After the Memorial Day holiday the House will take up a bipartisan intelligence bill, and legislation reforming how the Food and Drug Administration approves new drugs, a measure that passed overwhelmingly in the Senate.The House will vote on Oversight Committee Chariman Darrell Issa's proposal to overhaul the postal service, which will need to be reconciled with a different package the Senate passed this month. Dialing up the rhetoric . The Republican agenda signals the rhetoric on the House floor in June and July will match the sticky Washington heat. The GOP is planning votes on energy bills most Democrats oppose, pushing for more drilling on public lands and removing federal regulations on energy producers. Nadeam Elshami, spokesman for House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, immediately dismissed the GOP calendar. ""The Republicans have spelled out an agenda that fails to address jobs and will hold the middle class tax cuts hostage because the GOP refuses to let millionaires, Big Oil and corporations that ship jobs overseas pay their fair share,"" Elshami said. While both parties eagerly await the ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court on whether the president's signature health care law will stand, the House will vote to repeal a tax on medical devices that helps fund the law and overturn a provision of the law that would prohibit the use of personal spending accounts to pay for over the counter medications. GOP congressional leaders have been huddling on how to address health care if the high court strikes down the law, but aides caution that nothing has been decided on what kind of reforms Republicans would pursue if they were given a clean slate. Continuing their pledge to slash federal spending, the House will also vote on bills reducing federal agencies' budgets, but few of these bills are expected to pass the Senate, so both sides are gearing up for negotiations on a short-term bill to keep the government funded after the current authority runs out in September. While there may be a flurry of activity this summer on Capitol Hill, it's safe to say the December ""lame duck"" session of Congress will be a jam-packed month where most of these issues will be resolved.","House Republicans want to roll back regulation, dismantle ""Obamacare""
None of these measures will likely become law, but are election-year manuevering .
Congress must act by the end of the year to avoid dire fiscal consequences ."
"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The judge presiding over the Michael Jackson family's wrongful death lawsuit against AEG rejected the concert promoter's arguments that family members were the source of leaked e-mails in the case. AEG lawyers accused Michael Jackson's three children, his mother and their lawyers of giving the e-mails to a newspaper reporter in violation of the judge's order that they remain under seal. ""It is clear that only one entity could have done it,"" AEG lawyer Marvin Putnam said in a hearing last month. Jackson family lawyers became furious in court, pointing out that AEG was accusing 10-year-old Blanket Jackson, the youngest of the children. ""What's the idea, that Blanket Jackson got some documents and copied them and somehow walked them from Calabasas to Harriet Ryan?"" attorney Kevin Boyle said, pointing to Putnam. Jackson lawyers denied anyone associated with their legal team or their clients leaked the e-mails, and suggested that AEG lawyers may have done it themselves as a set up. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos issued her ruling on the question this week. The communications, published two months ago in the Los Angeles Times, revealed the promoter had doubts about Jackson's health and his ability to be ready for his ""This Is It"" concerts several months before his death. AEG wanted the judge to punish Katherine Jackson and the children -- Prince, Paris and Blanket -- by not allowing their lawyers to use the e-mails to convince a jury in a trial set for next April that the company contributed to the pop star's death. Jackson died of an overdose of a surgical anesthesia in combination with sedatives on June 25, 2009, according to the Los Angeles County coroner. Dr. Conrad Murray, who was hired to be Jackson's personal physician as he prepared for the shows, was found guilty last year of involuntary manslaughter in his patient's death. The Jackson suit contends that AEG contributed to the pop star's death by pressuring him to prepare even though the promoters knew he was in a weak condition and by its hiring and supervision of Murray. ""MJ is locked in his room drunk and despondent,"" AEG executive Randy Phillips wrote in a March 5, 2009, e-mail, the day Jackson announced the tour plans. ""I (am) trying to sober him up."" Reporter Harriet Ryan has refused to disclose her sources, although Howard Mann -- who was once Katherine Jackson's partner in a book venture -- has acknowledged that he gave the reporter a box of documents for her story. Days after the e-mails were published, AEG dropped its claim against a Lloyds of London underwriter for payout of a $17.5 million insurance policy on Michael Jackson. The insurer contended AEG hid Jackson's health problems and failed to respond to repeated requests for his medical history when applying for insurance for the 50 shows scheduled for London's O2 Arena. The Michael Jackson estate, which controls Michael Jackson Company LLC, is still pursuing the insurance payout. Perry Sanders, who is Katherine Jackson's personal attorney, told the judge that the Jacksons had no motive to leak the e-mails. ""Like we would go and blow up our own case against Lloyds of London?"" Sanders said. ""Our client and all the plaintiffs in this case are actually the ones who would receive the money."" Sanders also noted that AEG had failed to disclose the e-mails to the Lloyds of London lawyers despite a legal requirement to do so. While publication of the e-mails might have made AEG look bad, they were ""extremely negative against Michael Jackson,"" painting him ""as a basket case,"" Jackson lawyer Deborah Chang said. ""It's much more negative about Michael Jackson than it is about AEG, by far,"" Chang said. The leaked e-mails include one written by Randy Phillips weeks after Jackson's death in which the president of AEG Live -- the concert-promotion branch of AEG -- called it ""a terrible tragedy,"" but added ""life must go on."" ""AEG will make a fortune from merch sales, ticket retention, the touring exhibition and the film/dvd,"" Phillips wrote. AEG Live was allowed to sell Jackson tour merchandise and share in the profits from the documentary ""This Is It,"" produced from rehearsal video. The March 2009 e-mail from Phillips saying Jackson was ""locked in his room drunk and despondent"" indicate AEG Live's president saw Jackson's problems first-hand the day the pop star was to appear at the O2 Arena to publicly announce the shows. ""I screamed at him so loud the walls are shaking,"" Phillips wrote. ""He is an emotionally paralyzed mess riddled with self-loathing and doubt now that it is show time."" The promoter blamed London traffic when Jackson was 90 minutes late for the announcement that day. ""He's as healthy as he can be -- no health problems whatsoever,"" Phillips told CNN two months later to refute reports Jackson's health was threatening the concerts. The Los Angeles Times story, however, said the e-mails indicated major doubts about Jackson's ability to perform. ""We cannot be forced into stopping this, which MJ will try to do because he is lazy and constantly changes his mind to fit his immediate wants,"" AEG Live executive Paul Gongaware e-mailed to Phillips. Jackson's missed rehearsals in June triggered concerns in e-mails that he was slow in learning his dance routines and would have to lip-sync on stage, the newspaper reported. ""MJ is not in shape enough yet to sing this stuff live and dance at the same time,"" one e-mail from the show's music director read, the paper reported. A production manager wrote: ""He was a basket case. Doubt is pervasive."" A loud warning from show director Kenny Ortega, who worked closely with Jackson on previous tours, came in mid-June, just over a week before the star's death. Ortega wrote to Phillips that Jackson had ""strong signs of paranoia, anxiety and obsessive-like behavior"" and suggested they bring a ""top psychiatrist in to evaluate him ASAP."" ""It is like there are two people there. One (deep inside) trying to hold on to what he was and still can be and not wanting us to quit him, the other in this weakened and troubled state,"" Ortega wrote. ""I believe we need professional guidance in this matter."" Ortega testified at Murray's trial about his concerns about Jackson's frail condition and missed rehearsals. Those concerns resulted in a meeting six days before Jackson's death in which Murray assured the promoters he would have Jackson ready for rehearsals that next week. An e-mail from Phillips after that meeting said he had confidence in Murray, ""who I am gaining immense respect for as I get to deal with him more."" ""This doctor is extremely successful (we check everyone out) and does not need this gig, so he (is) totally unbiased and ethical,"" Phillips' e-mail said.","AEG failed to show the leaked e-mails came from the Jackson side of the lawsuit, judge says .

"London (CNN) -- As the dust settles from a third -- more effective and yet miniaturized -- North Korean nuclear test, the question rings out: What do they want? What are the intentions of Kim Jong Un, the newest, and youngest incarnation of the Dear Leader? The timing is of course, everything. Setting the test for the day of President Barack Obama's State of the Union address is not random luck. It puts pressure exactly where pressure is wanted: in Washington. As the White House doubtless received the news in the early hours of the morning, they would have been scrambling to find out what they do know. They will also have been fending off calls from the media along with more than a few concerned senators and congressmen. The message from the latter will no doubt have sounded something like the following, ""What are you doing about this?"" The call will be to act, but how, what, and where? Doubtless the Obama team will be as stumped as the many agitated diplomats rushing around the United Nations Security Council. Of course, the Chinese envoys at the Security Council will be concerned, but unlike their Japanese, South Korean, and American colleagues, they'll probably remain seated. They'll have firm orders from Beijing to keep emotions from boiling over. They may even water the sanctions down. As if they needed to. Any sanctions imposed would doubtless lose meaning as the morning trains began their daily shipment of goods and fuel across the border from China into North Korea. Xi Jinping, China's new leader, may want a ""new relationship"" with the United States, but that doesn't mean that Washington's strategic concerns are China's. And if we didn't already know what Pyongyang wants, the Obama team will no doubt be consulting its army of North Korea-watchers from the CIA, the State Department and the Department of Defense for a consensus. According to many observers I've spoken to over the years, North Korea wants the following (in order of importance): (1) regime survival; (2) acceptance as a nuclear power by the U.S.; (3) a peace treaty between the U.S. and North; (4) trade and economic growth on their terms, and hey, if we can (5) Korean unification under Pyongyang's benign rule. Of course, Obama's team will have been told about the ""provocation cycle,"" that unfortunate fact that the U.S. and its allies will sit down to the table with North Korea within six months of any provocation. Why will they do it? Because of the heat generated within Washington, the demands to ""do something,"" and to allay regional fears that Uncle Sam's defenses aren't what they used to be. So what can the Obama team do if sanctions are ineffective, and if a military response is out of the question? They can learn the art of pressure from their opponents on this. But, of course, the question is what makes Pyongyang squirm? It clearly isn't sanctions on luxury goods, as these have failed to deter endless missile tests. The answer to that riddle lies in the recent history of the Cold War, in which we learned the impact of free information on Soviet citizens behind the Iron Curtain. Information is the greatest weapon at the disposal of the Obama team, and they should apply it liberally. The North Korean people are their greatest ally and should be messaged accordingly. According to a 2011 report on North Korean susceptibility to outside media, radio and DVDs are the most common way for normal North Koreans to hear media from the outside world. The Obama team should not look to its diplomats in New York for salvation, but rather to Langley and to the U.S. military's best and brightest on the Korean peninsula. Each time Pyongyang ratchets up the pressure, Washington should reply in kind by smuggling in 150,000 DVDs about the free world outside North Korea's humble borders. Radio stations should work overtime to bring impartial news about the world to the hapless citizens, who still live in the Cold War, while the rest of us move on. Let's not let the pressure be one way. American newspapers and senators may tremble about a North Korean nuclear-tipped bomb, but certainly young Kim must tremble too at the prospect of his citizens awash in the streets, their eyes open to the nature of their lot. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Hemmings.","Hemmings: Test on day of Obama's State of the Union address not by luck .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's mother confirmed details previously reported by CNN that suggest she was tricked into flying to an Arizona spa instead of attending a concert by her sons in New Mexico last month, court documents reveal. Katherine Jackson's cell phone and iPad were taken from her at the spa and the TV and phone in her room were disabled, preventing her from calling home or knowing about the public controversy about her disappearance, Jackson said in a sworn statement filed in court Thursday. The 82-year-old Jackson family matriarch was out of touch with Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson for 10 days, leading to a missing-person report and the suspension of her guardianship of Michael Jackson's children, whom she has raised since their father's death three years ago. Complete coverage on the Jackson family . ""At the time, I trusted people to be honest with me,"" Jackson said. ""While I was away, I had no reason to question whether the people whom I placed the trust would inform me that Prince, Paris and Blanket were trying to reach me."" Those people included four of her children -- Janet, Jermaine, Randy and Rebbie Jackson -- according to her lawyers and others involved in the events. Her other children, including La Toya, Tito, Marlon and Jackie, have said they did not know where their mother was taken. A judge restored her as guardian in a hearing Thursday, based partly on her sworn statement explaining why she was out of contact, a description that mirrors what CNN reported after her nephew filed a missing-person report on July 21. The drama began on July 14, a day before she was to leave in an RV to see the Jackson's ""Unity"" show in Albuquerque on the next Tuesday, she said. Katherine Jackson resumes guardianship of grandkids . ""A doctor was brought to my home stating that he had been in contact with my longtime personal physician and was coming to check on me because my personal physician was unavailable,"" Jackson said. ""The doctor advised that it was better for me to fly and not drive to New Mexico. Believing that the doctor was sent at the request of my longtime personal physician, I followed what I understood to be doctor's orders and boarded a flight as opposed to driving in the motor home."" The doctor, identified as Dr. Allan Metzger, was not sent by Jackson's personal physician, Jackson lawyer Sandra Ribera told CNN. ""We came to find out that the doctor has no association with Dr. Metzger,"" she said. Metzger's previous connection to the Jackson family included his treatment of Michael Jackson over nearly two decades for insomnia, according to his testimony last year at Dr. Conrad Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial. A call to Metzger's Beverly Hills, California, office went unreturned Friday. Instead of landing in New Mexico, the plane went to Tucson and Katherine Jackson was driven to the Miraval Spa, according to her affidavit. Jermaine Jackson offers 'olive branch' ""Based on what I believed to be the orders of the office of my longtime personal physician, my phone was taken away,"" Jackson said. Her iPad was also taken, she said. ""While there was a telephone in my room, the telephone was not functioning and I could not dial out,"" she said. ""In addition, there was no picture on the television in my room. Despite repeated requests to those with me to have it fixed, the television was never fixed."" Without a TV, phone or iPad, she was unaware that her granddaughter was posting desperate pleas on her Twitter account for help in finding her. Paris Jackson, 14, tweeted on July 22, ""yes, my grandmother is missing"" and ""i haven't spoken with her in a week i want her home now."" Hours earlier, nephew Trent Jackson filed a missing-person report for his aunt. Katherine Jackson said she did have one clue something was amiss, though: ""One morning I woke up to the sound of the television,"" she said. ""While there was no picture, I heard a broadcast that stated I was missing."" ""When I asked about Prince, Paris and Blanket, I was informed by those who I was with that they had been in contact with others concerning the well-being of my grandchildren,"" Jackson said. ""I was never informed that Prince, Paris, Blanket and TJ were trying to reach me."" If she had known, she said, ""I would never have gone for such a long period of time without communicating with them."" Executives at the Miraval Resort, where Jackson stayed, did not immediately respond to CNN calls for comment about their role in the events. When Katherine Jackson returned home early July 26, she learned the details of what was happening at home and in the worldwide news media from Prince, Paris and Blanket. ""Although I am happy my grandma was returned, after speaking with her I realized how misguided and how badly she was lied to,"" Prince Jackson tweeted that morning. ""I'm really angry and hurt."" Katherine Jackson is planning another trip this month, but the children will go with her, she said in her statement. The family will travel to Gary, Indiana, for a celebration of Michael Jackson's 54th birthday.","""I trusted people to be honest with me,"" Katherine Jackson says .

"New York (CNN) -- A suspect is in custody after a man punched a young woman in the head, dragged her by the ankles and threw her onto train tracks this week, a Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority spokeswoman said Friday. William Clark, of Philadelphia, faces assault, robbery, theft and reckless endangerment charges, said Heather Redfern, the SEPTA spokeswoman. The suspect is thought to be between 25 and 30 years old, she said. The attack occurred around 3:30 p.m. Tuesday in Philadelphia's Chinatown, after a man approached a 23-year-old woman and asked her for a lighter. They were the only people at the Eighth and Race streets stop, Redfern said. A surveillance camera captured the assault. It shows the man attacking the woman and pulling her off a bench, her back hitting the floor as he slides her toward the tracks. She manages to stand at the edge of the platform just before he hurls her off. ""I started trying to fight him back as much as I could,"" the victim told CNN affiliate KYW. ""After it was over, the first thing that popped in my head was my son."" Unlike two incidents in New York City last month -- one in which a man was crushed by a train after a heated argument, and another in which a woman pushed a man onto the tracks, possibly because she believed he was Muslim or Hindu -- this victim escaped. She ""managed to climb off the tracks, suffering only minor bruises and scrapes,"" Redfern, said. After the attack, the man, who is thought to be homeless, took the victim's cell phone and left the subway station. Police say they increased manpower in stations but withheld the video of the attack from the public because the attacker was wearing a jacket with a distinctive logo, and police hoped he wouldn't discard the jacket. Clark was taken into custody Thursday afternoon, wearing a jacket with the Taj Mahal logo on the back, Redfern said. Police are seeking a motive but say they believe the attacker could be mentally unstable.","NEW: Suspect faces assault, robbery, theft and reckless endangerment charges .

"(CNN) -- County officials on Tuesday granted the paperwork needed for the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, to open -- after two years of legal wrangling and anti-Muslim sentiment that included vandalism. ""We're thrilled,"" said Saleh Sbenaty, a member of the mosque's board and planning committee. The first prayer service is set for 1 p.m. (2 p.m. ET) on Friday, before the close of the holy month of Ramadan, he noted. Controversy over the building erupted in 2010, when planning commissioners approved an expansion project at the existing mosque. Previously on CNN.com: Federal judge paves way for Tennessee mosque to open for Ramadan . The construction site has been vandalized several times, including an arson attack in 2010 and ""not welcome"" spray-painted on a sign announcing the project. Federal authorities have charged a Texas man with calling in a bomb threat to the center before last year's anniversary of the September 11 attacks. Tuesday's announcement comes a day after a mosque in Joplin, Missouri, burned to the ground in a fire that federal agents are investigating as a possible arson, and two days after an alleged white supremacist gunman killed six Sikhs and wounded three others, including a police officer, near Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In a statement issued Monday, the Interfaith Coalition on Mosques urged state and federal law enforcement officials ""to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the arson, and the destruction of the Joplin mosque, and to pursue hate crime charges if appropriate."" Sbetany said the Muslim community has noted the incidents with alarm. ""We are very concerned, as many people would be, and we're just hoping for the best and that our community will be spared from any violence in the long term,"" he told CNN. But he took a sanguine view about the mosque in Murfreesboro. ""We're looking at a brighter future, and a prosperous united community,"" he said. ""We are going to forget all of what happened and put it behind us."" Opinion: An American tradition of bigotry . The approval followed a tortuous path. In July, a federal judge in Memphis set aside a local judge's ruling from the previous month that voided a planning commission's approval, and ordered Rutherford County authorities to conduct a final inspection of the building. Tuesday's certificate, from Rutherford County's Building Code Department, is good for 30 days. Landscaping needs to be completed before the building can receive a permanent certificate, but Sbenaty said he was optimistic that it could be completed within the allotted time. Murfreesboro, a city of nearly 110,000 residents, is located 30 miles southeast of Nashville. Belief: My Faith, after my mosque was torched .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The death toll from the suicide bombing in Pakistan's financial capital, Karachi, rose to 40, authorities said Tuesday. The blast on Monday targeted a Shiite procession on M.A. Jinnah Road. The victims were among thousands of devotees commemorating Ashura, a major religious observance for the Shiites, one of two main Muslim denominations. Ashura marks the death anniversary of Imam Hussein, grandson of Prophet Mohammed. Hussein, who was killed in battle in Karbala in 680 A.D., is regarded as a martyr -- and the battle is one of the events that helped create the schism between Sunnis and Shiites, the two main Muslim religious movements. Religious mourning during Ashura is characterized by people chanting, beating their breasts in penance, cutting themselves with daggers or swords and whipping themselves in synchronized moves. Shias are a minority in Pakistan. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack. But the government is in the midst of an intense army offensive to rout militants from their haven along the country's border with Afghanistan. In retaliations, the militants have launched a series of deadly attacks in Pakistan. CNN's Pierre Bairin contributed to this report.","Death toll rises .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy is to trim his schedule to focus on 2013's four major trophies after a fairytale year in which he won five tournaments and both the U.S. PGA and European Tour money lists to finish on top of the world rankings. The 23-year-old says a greater understanding of his own game has propelled him to new heights as he gave notice to the game's great and good that he could dominate the sport for years to come. McIlroy's five-star 2012 included his second major at the PGA Championship, and he finished the season in perfect fashion by claiming the Dubai World Championship crown on Sunday. After topping the world rankings for the first time in his career in March, McIlroy's form has seen him firmly entrenched as the game's best player, and he told CNN that is in part down to greater self assurance. ""I know myself more, way better as a golfer, and what works for me,"" he told Living Golf anchor Shane O'Donoghue. ""Some things that I tried to incorporate into my game didn't work for me and I think you've just got to find your way a little bit. ""I guess over the last couple of years I've done that and winning big tournaments and winning majors, you grow in confidence and it gives you belief, belief that you are doing the right things."" McIlroy's performances on both sides of the pond ensured he emulated world No. 2 Luke Donald, who last year became the first man ever to top both the PGA Tour and European Tour money lists. And despite winning the Honda Classic, the BMW Championship, the Deutsche Bank and Dubai titles it is the major tournaments that remain McIlroy's main target. To give himself the best possible chance to launch his charge at the quadruple in 2013, he's taking his lead from one of the game's all time greats -- his rival and friend, 14-time major winner Tiger Woods. ""I'm gonna cut my schedule back a little bit next year and try and peak four times a year for the big tournaments,"" he explained. ""I think it's something that Tiger has done so well over the years and probably why he's been so successful. ""So I'm going to try and take a little bit of a leaf out of his book and cut down on the schedule and make sure I'm fresh for every tournament I play. ""I'm really looking forward to 2013 already, even though this year has just ended. I'm looking forward to preparing and getting my game in shape for next year."" McIlroy ended his final round in Dubai with five straight birdies to hold off the challenge of European Ryder Cup teammate Justin Rose, who led by two shots at one stage during a course record score of 62. But, watched by his girlfriend and tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, McIlroy wasn't to be denied a fairytale ending to his season. ""I sort of wrapped up the U.S. money list earlier on in the season and I guess my one big goal after that was to win the Race to Dubai and and win the European money list,"" he said. ""I finished second in China, third in Singapore and then got the win here. It was a big goal of mine. I wanted to win the Race to Dubai since the start of the year. ""The money list in America wasn't so much a priority, but it was nice to get that too. It's been a great way to finish the year."" McIlroy and Woods have grown close over the course of the year, sitting down together for a special interview on CNN's Living Golf show. The 23-year-old, who won his first major at the 2011 U.S. Open, also sat down for a chat with Jack Nicklaus, who is the game's greatest player with a haul of 18 majors. ""I guess it's a little surreal for me,"" McIlroy said. ""I never thought I'd be able to do it, sitting down with Jack and Tiger on Living Golf this year and doing interviews with them both. ""It's been pretty cool and getting to know both of them, trying to get as much advice off Jack as I can and a little bit off Tiger too. ""I've got a great relationship with both of those guys and hopefully that can continue.""","Rory McIlroy tells CNN he's gunning for all four major tournaments in 2013 golf season .

"New York (CNN) -- Defense attorneys for New York police officer Gilberto Valle, accused of a cannibalism plot, tried Thursday to show their client engaged in ""fantasy role-play"" during online conversations with his three alleged co-conspirators. Reviewing aloud the text during cross-examination of prosecution witness Corey Walsh, defense attorney Robert Baum sought to make the FBI agent counter his prior testimony that Valle's e-mails and online chats with others who said they were interested in cannibalism were real. Prosecutors have argued that Valle was ""deadly serious"" about online plans to allegedly kidnap, rape, torture, cook and eat women. None of Valle's alleged targets was ever victimized. Defense attorneys have argued that their client's conduct was ""pure fiction,"" ""make believe"" and fantasy role-playing. Also Thursday, prosecutors submitted evidence to support their claim that Valle accessed a national database to look for information about three women -- twice in July 2011 and once in May 2012. The evidence presented revealed Valle's unique police officer identification number, which corresponds with the identification number used to search the names of his alleged victims. Graphic e-mails read at New York cannibalism plot trial . Prosecutors also presented evidence that Valle had twice trained on the system and that he would have been instructed not to access the database for personal reasons. Valle is also charged with accessing the National Crime Information Center database illegally. The defense Thursday tried to show that Valle provided false information about the alleged targets' locations to some people he wrote online. In one instance, Valle said the woman was at a college four hours away, even though she attended school in New York. In other instances, he said he was watching an alleged target, when she really lived in Ohio. Records indicate Valle never went to Ohio. Valle repeated the same conversations with the alleged co-conspirators months later, reintroducing the name of the alleged target, and renegotiating a price to kidnap her. Valle never gave addresses when asked and said in some instances he didn't have the women's addresses, records show. Court records show that Valle did have the addresses of his alleged targets, from sending them a police charity card that he claimed would ""get (them) out of a minor traffic violation"" if they are pulled over by police. Prosecutor Randall Jackson argued that the police charity card was a ruse -- an attempt to gain personal information about the women. Valle planned to kidnap three women during the week of February 20, 2012, prosecutors said, pointing to some of the e-mails and chats. Baum asked Walsh repeatedly if he still thought that those were real conversations. Walsh replied, ""Yes, sir."" The defense reviewed online chats between Valle and a man identified as ""Moody Blues"" or ""Chris Collins"" or ""meatmarketman,"" who Valle met on the Dark Fetish Network. ""Meatmarketman,"" who lives in the United Kingdom, bragged in one conversation about one of his past victims, sending Valle a picture, and saying ""tried her alive first, actually it wasn't very good, very bloody."" Prosecutors: Officer was 'deadly serious' ""Meatmarketman"" expressed concerns in the conversations about cooking his victim to death and how it might affect the meat, adding he ""likes the idea of splitting the carcass."" In July 2012, Valle told meatmarketman, ""I am working on a document, everything we need to carry this out."" Authorities said they found a document in Valle's account on his wife's laptop titled ""Abducting and Cooking Kimberly -- A Blueprint."" Walsh testified about the document, revealed in court, which contained a picture of Kimberly Sauer and personal information, including her bra size and shoe size. Sauer's testimony Tuesday revealed that some of the information -- a different last name, birthplace, birthday and college education -- was inaccurate. The same document listed ""materials needed"" and included a gag, rope, chloroform and a tarp for the trunk. The FBI never found any of these items in his possession. References to the blueprint were found in chats the FBI deemed ""fantasy role-play,"" along with references to waterboarding and chloroform, terms frequently used in the online conversations. On redirect, the prosecution noted that none of the conversations between alleged co-conspirators made references to ""just fantasy,"" ""make believe"" or had instances where Valle wrote ""It's not real,"" and ""I am just talking fantasy,"" as he did write in 80% of the conversations with 21 other people found in his e-mail account. Walsh testified that some of these fantasy conversations contained some ""real"" statements that reflected Valle's state of mind. In many of the chats deemed fantasy, the prosecution noted that Valle discussed story-writing fantasy partners. One story he was working on with another person featured ""a restaurant that sells women in all varieties, sometimes grilled or roasted as whole, sometimes in steaks or pieces, sometimes a la carte, or in a buffet."" This was the fourth day of the trial of Valle, who has been a New York police officer for six years.","Defense team tries to paint Gilberto Valle's conversations as fantasy .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The lawsuit filed by Michael Jackson's three children and mother that accuses a concert promoter of contributing to the pop icon's death can go to trial, a Los Angeles judge tentatively ruled Monday.

A final order on Monday's decision has not been issued yet.

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- Two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Dan Wheldon died Sunday of ""unsurvivable injuries"" sustained during a multi-car wreck at the Las Vegas Indy 300. He was 33. The rest of the race -- the marquee event of the IZOD IndyCar World Championships -- was canceled. ""IndyCar is sad to announce that Dan Wheldon passed away from unsurvivable injuries. Our thoughts and prayers are with Dan and his family,"" IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard said. The remaining drivers, many of whom were visibly emotional after emerging from a meeting with IndyCar officials, did a five-lap salute in Wheldon's honor. Wheldon death must be a catalyst for change . ""Amazing Grace"" played as the drivers slowly wound their way around the track. More than a dozen vehicles were involved in Sunday's fiery wreck. Video of the accident showed cars spinning out of control, bursting into flames, and shooting smoke and debris into the air. Championship contender Will Power, Rookie of the Year candidate J.R. Hildebrand and driver Pippa Mann were also involved in the crash. They were taken to an area hospital for treatment. Power was evaluated and released, while Mann and Hildebrand are awake, alert and will stay overnight for observation, according to IndyCar spokeswoman Amy Konrath. Wheldon was in line to win $5 million if he had captured the checkered flag at Sunday's race. ""I lost one of my best friends, one of my greatest teammates,"" driver Tony Kanaan told reporters. ""I know this is a dangerous sport. I know we're exposed to that every day, in normal life as well. But you know, you don't think about it. Today we have to think about it,"" he said. Wheldon was known as a 'great family man' Racing accidents are not uncommon, though fatal ones have been rare in recent years. Safety improvements at such high-speed events have included the installation of ""soft walls."" So-called SAFER barriers, which include foam, are intended to soften the effects of impact.

""Most importantly, he was a fantastic husband, father and man -- a good friend to so many in this sport. His memory will live forever at the Speedway, both through the magnitude of his accomplishments on the track and his magnetism off the track,"" he said. After his second Indy 500 victory in May, Wheldon talked with CNN's ""American Morning"" about the intensity of the race track. His first win was in 2005. ""We're doing speeds in excess of 225 miles per hour. With this race, you never know what can happen. It's about staying focused and you really don't ever let off the power unless you have to,"" he said. Wheldon, who was born in Emberton, England, lived in St. Petersburg, Florida.

"Washington (CNN) -- House Speaker John Boehner says he and President Barack Obama have a ""pretty good relationship,"" but he also criticized Obama for fomenting what Boehner called ""class warfare"" in the political debate over spending, taxes and job creation. In an interview broadcast Sunday on ABC's ""This Week"" program, Boehner defended Republican opposition to efforts by Obama and Democrats to increase taxes on wealthy Americans as part of deficit reduction and job creation measures. ""Come on. The top 1% paid 38% of income taxes in America,"" Boehner, R-Ohio, said in the interview taped Friday when asked about the persistent GOP stand against tax increases. ""How much more do you want them to pay?"" Obama has crafted a campaign theme of Republicans defending the wealthy against tax cuts as part of a narrative that Boehner said was intended to pit segments of society against each other. ""We are not going to engage in class warfare,"" Boehner said, adding: ""The president's clearly trying to do it, and it's wrong."" Republicans generally want to cut government spending and debt by shrinking the size of government and therefore oppose raising taxes or adding new tax revenue. However, Boehner and some other Republicans advocate the possibility of increasing government revenue through a revised tax code that lowers rates but expands the number of taxpayers. Such a step would only be acceptable ""as long as our colleagues on the other side are serious about cutting spending,"" Boehner said in the ABC interview. During negotiations with Obama this year on a possible comprehensive deficit reduction deal, Boehner reportedly agreed to as much as $800 billion in additional revenue as part of the package. The talks broke down over differences on the tax issue and entitlement cuts, and Boehner said in the interview that the specific trade-offs discussed then with Obama appeared out of reach now. ""I think it's hard to put Humpty Dumpty back together again,"" he said. When asked how much additional revenue Republicans could accept in a deal, Boehner responded: ""That's the $64 million question. Nobody knows."" A special joint congressional committee created to work out a deficit reduction deal faces a November 23 deadline, with no breakthrough in sight. Boehner disagreed that the 12-member panel -- evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats from the House and Senate -- was at an impasse, but he emphasized the issues being tackled were hard -- too hard for he and Obama to resolve. ""Nobody (was) more upset that we couldn't come to an agreement, the president and I, than I was,"" Boehner said. As far as he and the president are concerned, ""it's been a little frosty here the last couple of weeks, but we've got a pretty good relationship.""","The House speaker says his relationship with the president is ""pretty good""

"(CNN) -- Authorities are negotiating with a religious cult in southwestern Mexico, trying to persuade leaders to allow public schools to operate in the isolated community, state media reported. ""It is a problem of fundamentalism,"" Michoacan state government secretary Jesus Reyna Garcia told Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency on Wedesday. The talks came after residents of New Jerusalem blocked roads into the community and attacked children, parents and teachers trying to enter a house that had been converted into a school. Three people were injured in the clashes Monday, state officials said. In July, members of the cult destroyed the only school building in the town, saying the Virgin of the Rosary, who they worship, told them school buildings were built by the devil and were to be demolished. The rising tension in the 3,000-person community, about 250 miles (400 kilometers) west of Mexico City, has drawn the attention of security officials in Michoacan state, who said 100 police were at the ready. ""We need to remind these people that they are not living in a separate territory, in an island,"" Gov. Fausto Vallejo told reporters. Leaders of the cult said they were not opposed to educating the community's youth. ""What happens is that those people are using the school as a way to introduce to our community things that are banned, like fashion, immorality, vice, drugs and alcoholism,"" said a New Jerusalem Cathedral spokesman known as Father Luis. Meanwhile, officials from Mexico's Council of Bishops have disavowed the group. ""While they use symbols of the Catholic Church, we reiterate that they have nothing to do with it,"" the council said in a statement Tuesday. The school year was scheduled to begin on Monday. ""We're willing to keep on teaching, but we need security guarantees for ourselves, the community and the children,"" teacher Ruben Gaona Rafael said. Some residents of the Turicato municipality, where New Jerusalem is located, have asked the government to intervene, saying they want their children to go to school without fear of being attacked. ""We hope that the government will do something about it, although we haven't seen anything yet,"" resident Manuel Campos said. ""We may have no other choice but to defend ourselves."" Mexico's Catholic bishops called on the local government to do more. ""Laws should be followed, and in this case, it is the local authorities who should intervene and impose order in a conflict that, if it is not attended to, could go even farther. It is not something that should wait. Now is the time to act and exercise the rule of law that has been violated,"" the statement said. New Jerusalem was founded decades ago, and there have been clashes reported among its residents in the past.

"London (CNN) -- The past decade has seen a number of developments on the African continent -- a relative increase in political stability, modest economic growth, and the early signs of a re-emergence of a young and vocal middle class engaging actively in debates about the continent's future. Poverty, war and disease are still heartbreakingly common, but there is a sense of possibility that a few decades ago seemed absent. It is against this backdrop that 500 people interested in ideas from Africa will gather on December 1 in Blackfriars, London, for the fourth TEDxEuston event to listen to 13 distinguished speakers, including Albie Sachs, ""patient capital"" investor Jacqueline Novogratz and writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie -- all of whom, in different ways are challenging conventional wisdom, through their work on the African continent. TEDxEuston, an independently organized TED event, aims to reflect the ideas and inspired thinking of a new generation of African leaders committed to engaging and re-engaging in an active and meaningful manner with the continent. What started as a small event in University College London in 2009 has grown to become one of the premier events focusing on Africa in London. See also: How 'Afropreneurs' will shape Africa's future . My involvement began with a plane crash in Nigeria. In December 2005, a Sosoliso Airlines flight from Abuja crashed as it prepared to land at Port Harcourt Airport. Only two of the 110 passengers aboard survived. Among those lost were my younger brother's best friend from childhood, Okoloma Maduewesi and his young nephew Chibuzo Kamanu. Sitting in my office in Bristol in England, trying to absorb the news, I was filled with a great anger and sadness which fuelled a polemic article that seemed to erupt through my fingers straight on to the page. The title was ""Why are we crying, we are all guilty"", and in it I accused all Nigerians of the negligence in our civic duties that had allowed tragedies like this to occur. The piece seemed to strike a chord with many Nigerians, bringing me praise and invective in equal measure, but one of the positive responses was from Emeka Okafor, a Nigerian living in New York and author of a blog called Timbuktu Chronicles. He asked if he could republish the piece on his blog, I agreed and we kept in touch. Read related: 'Change is imminent': African CEOs look to bright future . Months later, he sent me a link to a call for African fellowships for a TEDGlobal conference in Arusha Tanzania in 2007. I had never heard of TED, but on googling it, thought that it sounded interesting. I forwarded the call for applications to my networks and a few months later, was informed that I and Chikwe Ihekweazu, my friend and colleague had been selected. Our 4 days in Arusha were simply life changing -- we laughed and we cried and we were moved and inspired as we listened to African speakers like Ory Okolloh, the Kenyan blogger who had set up Mzalendo to bring the proceedings of the Kenyan Parliament to the people of Kenya for the first time, Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, then Nigeria's first female minister of Finance, who had just started publishing government financial allocations for the first time in Nigerian newspapers and Eleni Gabre Madhin just on the verge of leaving her job with the World Bank in Washington to set up Ethiopia's first commodity exchange. Patrick Awuah moved us to tears explaining why he had left a comfortable position at Microsoft to set up Ashesi College, Ghana's first liberal arts college. Listening to them, we were confronted for the first time with so many successful Africans seeking to contribute in small ways to changing the way things were in Africa. On leaving Arusha, Chikwe and I started our blog, Nigeria Health Watch, and 2 years later, applied for a licence to organize the first TEDxEuston event. From the beginning, we wanted to continue the conversations from Arusha, to recreate that sense of wonder and inspiration that we had felt in Arusha for an audience of Africans and friends of Africa in London. That first event with 100 people in a small hall at University College, largely organized on the back of our credit cards, has today grown into a greatly prized event, the only TEDx event outside Africa focusing completely on the African continent. Today, it is organized by a team of 16 dedicated African professionals from medicine, IT, literature, law and NGO backgrounds, all volunteering their time to help create an amazing event aimed at inspiring new ideas about Africa. At last year's event, Arnold Ekpe, then chief executive of Ecobank, one of Africa's largest banks said from the stage ""I have been attending conferences on Africa since the 80s and I have never felt the kind of energy that I am feeling in this room now."" For us, that was a vindication of the long hours put in to produce the event. From our interaction with the speakers this year, we expect tears and laughter in equal measure as we all are inspired by the African stories of another 13 amazing speakers. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ike Anya.","TEDxEuston aims to reflect the ideas of a ""new generation of African leaders""

"(CNN) -- It is the eight day period that will define the reign of Jose Mourinho, coach of Spanish giants Real Madrid. And it got off to the perfect start as the Portuguese manager led his side to a crucial 3-1 victory at archrivals Barcelona to seal a place in the Spanish Cup final -- one of only two trophies left for the club to win. Now, after another meeting with Barcelona on Saturday in the league, Mourinho will turn his thoughts to the second leg of their last 16 European Champions League tie against English Premier League leaders Manchester United which arrives next week. The sides drew 1-1 in the first leg. Real trail Barca by 14 points in the league, meaning retaining their title is surely beyond them, but with Mourinho seemingly destined to leave the club at the end of the season his tenure will only be deemed a success should he complete a cup double before May is out. That prospect will only have increased after this emphatic victory in the Camp Nou. Barcelona are dominant in the league but seem to be faltering without their manager Tito Vilanova who has been absent since the beginning of February while he has treatment for throat cancer in New York. They were beaten 2-0 by AC Milan in their Champions League last 16 first leg tie, an encounter in which their star striker Lionel Messi had one of his quietest games on record for the club. He was again nullified as Real cruised to a 4-2 aggregate victory. Real got off to the perfect start when their star striker Cristiano Ronaldo won a penalty after a challenge from Gerard Pique on 13 minutes. The Portuguese picked himself off the floor to slam the spot kick into the net. Cesc Fabregas claimed a penalty as Barca looked to level the tie but the referee waved away his appeals before Andres Iniesta cut in from the right and fired wide of the target. Barcelona's best chance of the half came when Alvaro Arbeloa brought down Iniesta on the edge of the penalty area. Messi stepped up to take the free kick but though the ball beat the wall it flashed a foot wide of the post. Sergio Busquets forced Real goalkeeper Diego Lopez into his first save of the match with a shot from the edge of the area that took a deflection off Germany international Sami Khedira. But Ronaldo struck a decisive second just before the hour mark. A long ball downfield saw Angel Di Maria beat Barca captain Carles Puyol and though his shot was saved by Pinto, Ronaldo was on hand to tuck home his 16th goal in 19 cup games for Real. It got worse for Barca as Real's young French centre half Raphael Varane rose unchecked from a corner to head home a third goal that truly knocked the stuffing out of the home side. Jordi Alba grabbed a late consolation goal for Barcelona but by that time many of the 90,000 fans had made their way to the exits. Real will face either city rivals Atletico Madrid or Sevilla in the final. Atletico take a 2-1 first leg lead to Sevilla on Wednesday night. In the English FA Cup, Premier League outfit Everton breezed past third tier Oldham Atheltic in their fifth round replay. Oldham, who eliminated Everton's Merseyside rivals Liverpool in round four, earned a replay with an injury-time equaliser in the original tie but couldn't spring another surprise at Goodison Park, losing 3-1. First half goals from Kevin Mirallas and England international Leighton Baines put Everton in control before Leon Osman made it 3-0 on the hour mark. Matt Smith grabbed a consolation for Oldham. In Italy, Fiorentina missed the chance to go level on points with AC Milan in fourth as an 84th minute goal from Lazaros Christodoulopoulos handed Bologna a 2-1 win.

"(CNN) -- A fourth person has died, a day after a lumber plant employee shot several people at his company's factory near Lucerne, Switzerland. The shooter killed himself and two other people Wednesday, and one of seven other people wounded in the incident died Thursday morning, according to Lucerne county police spokesman Urs Wigger. Police have not yet named any of the victims, and they had no update Thursday on how the other six people were faring. The murder weapon was a Sphinx AT-380 handgun -- not a military-issued weapon -- Wigger said, adding that police were investigating how the shooter got the gun, and whether he had it legally. The gunman, 42, was a long-time employee of Kronospan, a wood panel manufacturer in the village of Menznau, about 30 kilometers (19 miles) outside Lucerne, police said. The factory employs 350 people, according to a Lucerne-based newspaper. It's unclear why the gunman opened fire as employees were taking a morning break. Local media reports suggest the plant has had to cut production because of a reduction in the timber harvest. A statement posted in five languages on Kronospan's Swiss website on Wednesday read: ""It is with tremendous sadness that we must confirm that there has been a shooting incident at our factory this morning, resulting in multiple serious injuries and fatalities. The shock and grief at Kronospan is not possible to put into words."" The posting also included a hotline number for employees. That hotline has been ""widely used,"" according to police. Representatives for the company's U.S. and UK branches said they had limited information about what happened and offered their condolences. ""It's a terrible tragedy, and our thoughts are with the families of the people who have lost their lives,"" the UK spokesman said. ""We, too, are deeply saddened by this tragic event, and our thoughts are with our Swiss colleagues and the families of those involved,"" said the U.S. spokeswoman. The Menznau Kronospan factory, which makes wood products under the brand name Kronoswiss, is one of 10 plants in seven countries run by the Swiss Krono Group, according to the company's website. Its U.S. subsidiary, Kronotex USA, says on its website that the company has been a family business since its inception in 1897 in Austria, and its total annual sales exceed $1 billion.

"(CNN) -- A stampede at an elementary school in central China killed four students and injured more than 10 others Wednesday morning, authorities said. The cause of the crush at Qinji Elementary School in Hubei province is still under investigation, the state-run news agency Xinhua said in a short report. State-run broadcaster CCTV reported that it happened after an iron gate at the students' dormitory failed to open. As the children were unable to exit through the gate, a large number of people built up against it, CCTV said. The pressure caused the gate to collapse, resulting in the stampede, the broadcaster reported. It wasn't immediately clear why the gate wouldn't open. A photograph carried by Xinhua showed one of the students injured in the crush, Zhang Jiali, receiving treatment on a bed in a hospital in Laohekou City in Hubei. The child was still dressed in a purple jacket and stripy, wooly leggings. A total of 11 children were injured in the stampede, authorities in Laohekou said on their microblog account. A number of stampedes have taken place at Chinese schools in recent years. In 2009, eight students were killed and 26 were injured in an incident at a middle school in Hunan province. And in 2006, a stampede was reportedly set off in a middle school in Sichuan province by a student who stopped to tie shoelaces on a staircase. The resulting crush killed eight people and injured 27.

"(CNN) -- When the body is totally inert, the brain can still be busy. Even in a coma, brain imaging technology has shown, some people's brains show blood flow patterns that indicate something is going on inside their heads, although it's not necessarily indicative of awareness. Doctors say they have observed ""significant brain activity"" in former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. They are basing this statement on the results of experiments done with functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, showing that Sharon's brain behaves differently when he is presented with familiar sounds and pictures than with unfamiliar stimuli. ""It suggests the brain has the capability to react,"" said Dr. Fatta Nahab, neuroscientist at the University of Miami, who is not involved in Sharon's care. ""What that means in terms of long-term outcomes is indeterminate."" FMRI lets scientists see changes in blood flow in the brain, which is associated with neuronal activity. It does not measure the actual activity, but can provide clues that some areas are still functional. How such results should be interpreted, and if there's any connection to a potential recovery, is not known. Doctors compared Sharon's brain responses when he viewed photos of random houses to when he was shown a photo of his own house. They observed a different response in the brain in conjunction with the familiar place than for the other images. Sharon, 84, also showed distinct brain activity patterns when his family members spoke to him, compared to when their voices were distorted so they were no longer familiar and sounded like gibberish. The brain response for a family member's voice was in ""the correct location"" for when a cognitively normal person hears familiar people speaking, said Dr. Ilan Shelef, head of Medical Imaging at Soroka University Medical Center, who was involved in the fMRI tests but is not Sharon's attending physician. Such results suggest there may be some higher processing of information going on, and that areas of the brain important for processing complex stimuli are still functioning, said Dr. Keith L. Black, chairman and professor in the department of neurosurgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, who is not involved in Sharon's care. It is not proof that Sharon is conscious of the familiar sounds and images, and recognizing them as a fully healthy person would, he said. Because doctors had not given these tests to Sharon previously, it's unclear whether this represents an improvement. CNN has reported since 2006 that Sharon has been in a coma since suffering a massive stroke that year. The longer a person is in a coma, the less likely he or she is to recover, Nahab said. Shelef said that Sharon is not in a coma or vegetative state, and is somewhere between a coma and consciousness. He sleeps, wakes up, eats and swallows on his own, and his eyes open and close, Shelef said. Shelef declined to comment on Sharon's general health. There is a continuum between brain death and normal awareness that patients such as Sharon fall into, Black said. The fMRI results suggest he is not brain dead, because areas above the brain stem are showing activity. There are also patients who are ""locked-in,"" and are totally aware of the sights and sounds around them, but cannot move or speak. Brain-controlled devices may help paralyzed people . For clinical purposes, it appears that Sharon is in a coma, Black said. ""We have seen patients make remarkable improvements after being in a coma for a long time, but the best prognostic indicator is how one does over time,"" Black said. ""Most improvement will occur within the first one to two years."" As Sharon has been in a coma for seven years, the fMRI evidence is positive, but it would be unusual for him to start talking, for example, given how long he has stayed in this state, Black said. The scientists have likely gotten these new results because, even when a person is in a coma, ""parts of the nervous system that are still functioning are capable of learning and capable of changing their activity patterns,"" said Dr. Daniel Hanley, professor of neurology, neurosurgery and anesthesia at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who is not involved with Sharon's care. It's a phenomenon that has been studied and described before, he said. ""Even with severe brain injury, some qualities of the human existence are preserved and we should always treat patients with dignity,"" Hanley said. But it's unclear what such brain activity patterns would mean for a patient's future. ""We don't understand how these small changes in function are linked to recovery,"" he said. If the same fMRI tests are repeated six months and nine months from now to compare activity levels, that would provide some indication of whether Sharon is headed in a positive direction, Black said. ""What you really want to know: Is he improving, and can you extrapolate that improvement out over some period of time to predict how well he's going to ultimately improve to?"" he said. Comatose Sharon moves home for weekend . CNN's Elizabeth Cohen and William Hudson contributed to this report.","It's not known how fMRI results relate to patient's recovery from a coma .

"(CNN) -- Americans are watching more video online, on their cell phones and on television, according to the Nielsen Company's latest ""three screen"" report. Viewers are watching more television on more kinds of screens than ever. The report, issued Monday and covering the last three months of 2008, shows that the average American television viewer is watching more than 151 hours of television per month -- an ""all-time"" high -- up from more than 145 hours during the same period the previous year, Nielsen said. The increase in television watching is part of a long-term trend, said Nielsen spokesman Gary Holmes. He attributed the rise to a greater availability of televisions -- the average household has more televisions than people, he said -- and to niche programming. There are ""many, many more cable channels than before,"" he said. Read the full report (PDF) Also contributing to the increase are digital recorders, DVR and TiVo devices, which allow viewers to watch programs at their leisure rather than during the show's slated time slots. Nielsen has dubbed such viewing ""timeshifted TV."" ""DVR has helped keep television alive and well,"" said Robert Thompson, the founding director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. ""That's made a lot of people watch more television than they used to,"" he said. The use of recorders has risen by about 20,000 people from the fourth quarter in 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2008, about 73.9 million people used them, Nielsen said. Viewership of videos on the Internet and on mobile phones also increased from the summer months, Nielsen said, although the rise was more modest. People who watch video on the Internet spend about three hours doing so per month, and those who watch video on mobile devices spend nearly four hours per month that way. The presidential election likely helped augment viewership, Thompson said. The ""new series of this year was 'The Barack Obama Show,' "" he quipped. The tanking economy may also have played a role in the uptick in television watching, as Americans looked for low-cost ways to entertain themselves, some analysts said. Americans are staying at home instead of going out, and they're also taking fewer vacations, said David Schick, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus, an investment banking firm. And while Thompson and James Webster, a communication professor at Northwestern University, say the state of the economy certainly isn't going to hurt television viewership, both experts emphasized that the increased viewership trend is several years old. They also cautioned against reading too much into the Nielsen statistics. Though Nielsen reports Americans are watching five hours of television a day, Webster noted that Nielsen has no means of determining if they are paying close attention to the programs or if they just have them on in the background. People may have the television on while they are doing other things, Thompson added.","Nielsen report says average American viewer watching 151 hours of TV per month .

"PAPEETE, France (Reuters) -- A passenger aircraft ploughed into the sea in French Polynesia on Thursday, killing at least 14 people, with another six still missing, French authorities in Papeete said. A Twin Otter aircraft similar to the Air Moorea plane that crashed Thursday after take-off from Moorea Island. An Air Moorea Twin Otter aircraft with 19 passengers and a pilot on board crashed after taking off from Temae airport in Moorea Island, en route to the local capital, Papeete, a short flight away. Police said 14 bodies, including that of the pilot, had been recovered but no survivors had been found. The search for the remaining passengers was continuing. All but two of the victims were French. A spokeswoman for Air Moorea said all 20 people aboard the aircraft were feared killed. ""We heard a big boom,"" an unidentified fisherman told French television. ""We didn't try to understand, we were just there, we took maybe 30 seconds to get there. We just saw a whole lot of debris on the surface and bodies as well."" French President Nicolas Sarkozy said in a statement he was ""profoundly saddened"" by the accident and offered his sympathy to the families of the victims. Christian Estrosi, secretary of state for France's overseas territories, would go to the region to show the government's solidarity, he said. Television pictures showed police boats at the scene of the accident with divers in the water and emergency workers at temporary posts on the shore. The plane, a Dehavilland Twin Otter aircraft, veered to the right after take-off for the short flight to the main island of Tahiti and crashed into the ocean at around 12:15 p.m. local time (2215 GMT) on Thursday. Aviation authorities said weather conditions were clear. The plane came down one mile from the coast near fishermen, who tried to help those on board, Air Moorea said in a statement. It gave no further details. Moorea is one of around 118 islands scattered across an area the size of Europe in the South Pacific that make up France's overseas territory of French Polynesia. Authorities in Papeete said the victims included two tourists and two European officials posted to the region, who local media said had been visiting a water purification plant. Moorea is popular with foreign tourists and the crash occurred in the tourist high season. The bodies of all the victims found so far have been taken by French navy personnel to a mortuary. Air Moorea, a subsidiary of domestic airline Air Tahiti, said it had never had an accident in its 35-year history. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

"(CNN) -- ""The dignity of the American presidency has been tarnished! Congress must investigate. Let's make sure this type of tragedy never happens again. And how do we know that was really Beyonce? Maybe it was a hologram or a body double!"" The above are just the (slightly) exaggerated responses of some in the cybersphere to the revelation that Beyonce Knowles might have lip-synced all or part of the national anthem at Monday's presidential inauguration. There are simply too many people in this country who go from zero to (faux) outrage in a matter of nanoseconds. Just look at Twitter and you will see the overuse of capital letters by people who feel CHEATED and ROBBED by the possibility of Beyonce's prerecorded performance. The U.S. Marine Band, which provided the musical accompaniment for Beyonce, is neither confirming nor denying that she lip-synced to a prerecorded track, although earlier a spokeswoman said the pop star ""did not actually sing."" The Marine Band did explain that Beyonce, like all singers at the inauguration, made a recording of the song she was scheduled to sing which would be played ""in case of freezing temperatures, equipment failure or extenuating circumstances."" To be honest, if Beyonce did lip sync the entire song she should be nominated for an Emmy award for outstanding acting in a TV Special, because it looked amazingly real. And I worked at ""Saturday Night Live"" in 2004 when Ashlee Simpson had her infamous lip-syncing meltdown so I have seen up close the horrors of bad lip-syncing. It's not that I'm unsympathetic to those who wanted to experience Beyonce singing live. There's truly no substitute for live performances. (Although on nights when I'm tired, I wish I could lip-sync some of my jokes to a prerecorded track, but alas, that's not allowed in my field -- yet.) And true, Kelly Clarkson sang a great version of ""My Country 'Tis of Thee"" live at the inauguration. However, to those outraged by the thought of Beyonce's possible lip-syncing, you need to keep a few things in mind. First, there's no dispute that was Beyonce's voice we heard. This isn't a Milli Vanilli type scandal where a singer lip-synced to songs actually sung by others. Secondly, performing to prerecorded tracks has been done at previous presidential inaugurals as well as at other big outdoor events because of audio concerns posed by weather conditions or technical issues. Indeed, at President Obama's 2009 inauguration, music legend Yo-Yo Ma mimicked playing his cello to a prerecorded track because the frigid weather would have made it too difficult to play live in tune. And at the 2012 Olympic games in London, the majority of musical performances in the opening and closing ceremonies were performed to prerecorded tracks, including ones by iconic bands like The Who and the Rolling Stones, because of acoustic issues with the outdoor venue. (Audience members were told well in advance that some songs would not be performed live.) Obviously, this is not an uncommon practice in special situations. Plus, this is clearly different than if people had paid to see Beyonce in concert and she lip-synced most, if not all, of her songs. That would have been wrong, just as it was when Britney Spears did it during her 2009 tour. In fact, Britney's overuse of lip-syncing so angered people in Australia that lawmakers there actually considered passing a law requiring that concertgoers be informed if parts of a show will be lip-synced. Beyonce hasn't responded about whether she did lip-sync. If she did, it could have been for a very valid reason, such as concerns about the weather or acoustics, or maybe nerves -- even superstars must get a little nervous when they see a crowd of close to a million people. Unfortunately for Beyonce, this issue will not go away quickly, because she's scheduled to perform in less than two weeks during the Super Bowl halftime show. There's no doubt reporters will hound her regarding whether she will be singing live or not. But to me, the real question people should be asking is: Who is going to win the Super Bowl? The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Beyonce might have lip-synced the national anthem at Obama's inauguration .

"Warsaw, Poland (CNN) -- European football's governing body opened disciplinary proceedings Saturday against Croatia over what it said was racist behavior by its supporters during a Euro 2012 match against Italy. UEFA said it was acting over ""the setting-off and throwing of fireworks, and the improper conduct of supporters,"" including racist chants and the displaying of racist symbols. The UEFA Control and Disciplinary Body will deal with the case on Tuesday, it said. Croatia drew 1-1 in the match against Italy in Poznan on Thursday, with Mario Mandzukic scoring for the Croatians and Andrea Pirlo claiming a goal for Italy. UEFA president Michel Platini urged fans who are attending decisive matches on Saturday night to ""conduct themselves with dignity and respect."" Russia plays Greece in Warsaw, while the Czech Republic plays Poland in Wroclaw. ""Of course, there is rivalry and passion, and all teams want to win -- but we must remember that the results on the pitch are what really matter,"" Platini said in a statement. ""EURO 2012 is a celebration of football and I invite the fans, the vast majority of whom have conducted themselves in an exemplary manner so far, to continue to do so for the remainder of the tournament."" The issue of racism has threatened to mar the soccer tournament, which is being co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine. Members of the Dutch squad claimed to hear monkey noises during an open training session in Krakow, Poland, before the tournament started, though the Dutch FA opted not to lodge an official complaint with UEFA. In addition, family members of two black English players chose not to travel to the competition for fear of being subjected to racism. UEFA has already taken the step of writing a letter to the mayors of each host city asking for a zero-tolerance approach to racist abuse. UEFA's disciplinary body has also been busy since the tournament started just over a week ago. Russia has already been fined and handed a suspended points deduction for improper conduct against the Czech Republic, while also still awaiting the verdict of a UEFA investigation into alleged racist chanting during the match. The German Football Federation was fined $12,500 after its fans threw paper onto the pitch during a meeting with Portugal, with the Iberian team also ordered to pay $6,250 for delaying the start of the second half. A Danish player, Nicklas Bendtner, may also face sanctions next week after lowering his shorts during a game Wednesday to reveal that he was wearing underwear displaying the name of an Irish bookmaker named Paddy Power. Under the laws of the games as outlined by FIFA, the global body which governs soccer, undershorts must be the same color as the shorts worn by the player. His shorts were red but the Paddy Power undershirts were green.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- They share the same rotund facial features, similar expressions and gait. But the two sons of Kim Jong Il have never met, and based on a new book being published in Japan this week, there appears to be little fraternal allegiance, at least from the eldest son's side. Kim Jong Nam, the eldest son, is the half-brother of Kim Jong Un, the new leader of North Korea. Kim Jong Nam believes his youngest brother will fail as the ""supreme leader"" of the reclusive state, according to the book's author, Yoji Gomi. ""He's not comfortable that his younger brother is succeeding the power of Kim Jong Il,"" says Gomi, the author of ""My Father, Kim Jong Il, and Me,"" which will hit bookshelves in Tokyo on Wednesday. ""He (Kim Jong Nam) sees his brother failing. He thinks he (Kim Jong Un) has a lack of experience, he's too young, and he didn't have enough time to be groomed. Those three reasons are why he thinks he'll fail."" Kim Jong Nam is the most public of Kim Jong Il's sons, known primarily for his blunders and semi-exile from North Korea. An overweight and careless playboy, Kim Jong Nam enraged his father more than a decade ago when he was arrested slipping into Japan with forged documents -- simply to visit Disneyland. Kim Jong Nam lives in China and Macau and has occasionally popped up in the Japanese news media. It was during one of those appearances in front of Japanese reporters -- in Beijing, during 2004 -- that Gomi, a reporter for the Tokyo Shimbun, first met Kim Jong Nam. They exchanged email addresses and began an occasional correspondence. In the past few years, Gomi said they had begun to write more, exchanging 150 emails. Last year, Kim Jong Nam agreed to meet with Gomi in Macau and Beijing for interviews. What surprised Gomi the most, he said, is that the eldest of Kim Jong Il's sons was very smart and knowledgeable about the world -- and open-minded, especially about economic reforms. ""He spoke out against his father's 'military first' policy,"" says Gomi, countering widely held notions that the Disneyland debacle caused Kim Jong Nam to fall out of favor with his father. ""He wants North Korea to embrace economic reform and open its doors."" Kim Jong Nam painted a picture of a father who was strict but was often warm-hearted to his eldest son, Gomi said, especially on special occasions. ""Kim Jong Il called his son on his birthday,"" Gomi said. Kim Jong Nam says the half-brothers were kept apart, following an ancient history of raising potential successors separately. He says his father refused to discuss the succession of power for many years because it signaled his own death, according to Gomi -- only after his illness accelerated did the succession begin. Both sons were educated in Switzerland, leaving Kim Jong Nam convinced that his country needed to embrace economic reforms. Kim Jong Nam believes his brother won't have the power to push through reforms, Gomi said. ""He's afraid the youngest son has no idea, no vision about economic reform,"" he said. Professor Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University says Kim Jong Nam has been fairly public in the past, keeping his distance from the regime's inner circle. Lankov says he believes the latest comments are the reaction of a normal, intelligent human being who has a good understanding of the situation in North Korea. ""I would say maybe this smart, overweight playboy from Macau has the highest chances of physical survival of all the Kim Jong Il children,"" says Lankov. ""In the long run, the history of the North Korean state is going to end badly. We might see a coup, a revolution, a conspiracy, because in the very long run the system is not sustainable,"" Lankov said. ""He (Kim Jong Nam) is away, he is secure. It is quite possible that many of his siblings will die a violent death sooner or later, and he is likely to live until an old age, writing memoirs, explaining to everybody how misunderstood his family was.""","Kim Jong Nam, the eldest son, is the half-brother of Kim Jong Un, the new leader of North Korea .

"Amman, Jordan (CNN) -- Observers who for the first time were allowed to monitor elections in Jordan said Friday that the vote showed a marked improvement from past polls, but there is still some way to go. An international team fielded by the National Democratic Institute, made up of 50 observers from 29 countries, highlighted ""shortcomings and irregularities,"" as well as certain systemic problems. ""The unequal size of districts and an electoral system that amplifies family, tribal and national cleavages limit the development of a truly national legislative body and challenge King Abdullah's stated aim of encouraging 'full parliamentary government,' "" it said. But, the institute said, the improvements seen ""should give competitors and voters in this and future electoral contests more confidence that their votes are counted fairly and their choices reflected through the election system."" Read more: Jordan deploys security forces on eve of 'landmark' elections . About 1.3 million Jordanians went to the polls in Wednesday's balloting, representing 56.6% of registered voters according to the newly instituted Independent Elections Commission. The vote was held amid political tensions and calls for wider reform. Opposition groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood, boycotted the election, saying the country's new electoral laws -- brought in by Jordan's ruler, King Abdullah II, after protests -- favored the monarchy. Nimer al-Assaf, deputy secretary general of the Islamic Action Front, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan, told CNN the election ""was as expected -- just a mere copy of the parliament that was dissolved."" He disputed the official turnout numbers, but added, ""even if they were true, still only one-third of Jordanians participated, so it's not really representative."" More than 3 million Jordanians were eligible to vote for candidates to the new 150-member House of Deputies, officials said. King Abdullah, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland on Friday, challenged the criticisms made by the Muslim Brotherhood. ""At the beginning, the doubters out there and the opposition didn't think anyone would register to vote. We had an unprecedented registration, 70%, which is much higher than any other country in the Middle East,"" he said. ""Again, the turnout of 56.6% (announced) yesterday was way beyond anybody's expectations."" These figures indicate the country's leaders and the people have ""moved on,"" Abdullah said. He suggested that the Muslim Brotherhood should do the same, in order to be part of an inclusive political future. Buying of votes . Polling was held under the watchful eye of 47,000 police officers and another 7,000 election observers. David Martin, head of the European Union's Election Observation Mission in Jordan, praised the way balloting was handled but, like the National Democratic Institute, pointed to systemic problems. ""Technically, the elections were remarkably organized,"" he told CNN on Friday. ""The IEC did an excellent job ensuring that those who wanted to vote could vote in secret. And the counting was proficiently professional."" He said his mission's estimate of turnout was as high as 60%, broadly in line with that of the IEC. ""Our criticism is that the elections were conducted within a weak legal framework and that the system didn't lead itself to an even outcome,"" he said. There were some violent incidents, concentrated in Maan, Tafileh, and Karak, and some districts in Amman -- some within tribes, others between tribes and some concerning individuals, he said. But while such violence is ""unacceptable and not helpful to the process,"" the incidents seem to have been unconnected. ""Although we are always concerned about violence, we are not worried this was a concerted attempt to undermine the credibility of the elections,"" Martin said. Read more: A lot at stake for Jordan in an election of firsts . However, an issue to be addressed is that of illegal campaigning outside polling centers, Martin said. CNN reporters witnessed many people passing out fliers, pamphlets and cards promoting specific candidates outside polling stations. Another observer group, the International Republican Institute, said its teams -- deployed at more than 175 polling stations -- saw illegal campaigning ""outside the majority"" it visited. The institute said it had also heard numerous allegations of vote-buying on election day, despite improved enforcement of rules banning this in the run-up to the vote. At least two candidates, including Ahmed Safadi, a major contender, were arrested for vote-buying the day before polling. They were released on bail. Al-Assaf from the Islamic Action Front, Jordan's largest opposition group, said: ""The parliament will be marked as a parliament that bought votes and spent time in jail. The people won't trust them. ""It's best to wait for a few days. We will see there was a lot of rigging of these elections."" The international observer missions say that the newly implemented election law is a big improvement on the past, but they say it should be seen only as the beginning of the reform process. The law should be reviewed ""to encourage political competition and the formation of coalitions and political parties,"" the National Democratic Institute said, as well as to bolster the legal framework around the formation of parliament. Steps are also needed to ensure greater participation of women and young people and to develop the role of election officials, it said. Political strain . Wednesday's vote is the 17th time Jordan has gone to the polls to elect a parliament since becoming a nation in 1946, but it was the first time that an independent election commission oversaw polling. A field of more than 1,400 candidates vied for the seats, of which 15 were reserved for women -- up from 12 in the previous parliament. Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh told CNN on election day that the vote was ""the culmination of a constitutional process, the beginning of a new phase of reforms. It is a continuing process."" He said his country had ""anticipated the Arab Spring,"" so the king began reforms ""many years ago."" But he acknowledged that protests in the region had expedited the changes inside Jordan. Read more: Arab Spring knocking at Jordan's door . The king has stated in discussion papers that the new prime minister will be designated based on consultations with the parliamentary bloc that has the majority, Prime Minister Abdullah Ensour said Wednesday. The deliberate steps at transparency are crucial for a country that's under a great deal of political strain -- and whose stability has ramifications for the world outside its borders. Recent events have threatened the fragile monarchy to the point that some analysts are warning of collapse. What began with protests by the Islamic Action Front, Jordan's branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, has given way to broader unrest led by tribal factions known as al-Hirak (""The Movement"").

In an effort to quell the protests, King Abdullah dissolved parliament last year and amended election laws.

"St. John, Indiana (CNN) -- With just his dream, determination and hard work, Bill Keith started a solar fan business nearly a decade ago out of his garage in northwest Indiana. The one-time roofer simply wanted to make enough money to care for his family and to create a ripple effect for other workers, particularly in this economically depressed area outside Chicago. Keith vowed to create his solar attic fans entirely out of parts made in the United States. Using only the sun's energy, the fan pumps hot air out of the attic -- lowering cooling bills -- and doesn't have to be in direct sunlight to work. His first year, Keith said he barely made enough to scrape by -- about $39,000 in sales. ""It wasn't enough to cover expenses,"" Keith recalled. But he stuck with it and his promise to buy American parts. Keith's company, SunRise Solar, steadily grew to the point that he couldn't keep up with the influx of orders. He looked around for companies that could help him manufacture the fans, concentrating his search in his own backyard. He eventually found a company that could help and needed the extra work about 90 miles away in Warsaw, Indiana. He bought molded plastic in Indiana as well as fasteners, nuts, bolts and steel. Wire for the fans came from workers in New Jersey, while the motors were from Pennsylvania and Chicago. Even his cardboard boxes were manufactured in nearby South Bend. Keith had achieved his own small part of the American dream: He became a self-made small-business owner. And in 2008, his success attracted the attention of the soon-to-be next president of the United States, Barack Obama. That year, he got an unexpected call from a representative of the new administration. ""He said he was with the Obama transition team looking for small companies,"" Keith recalled. He later met with the man who told Keith, ""we want to interview you, vet you."" ""Guy sat right there talking with me, said 'I really love your story and I'm going to push it up the rank,'"" Keith said. And that's exactly what happened. Shortly after he was inaugurated, Obama held a town hall meeting in the economically devastated city of Elkhart, Indiana. Keith and his wife were asked to come and -- prodded by his wife -- he stood up and told the president about his solar business. He asked Obama what he planned to do to encourage small business owners like himself. The question turned Keith into a White House solar superstar. ABC, CNBC and other media came calling to tell the story of the roofer who built a solar company out of his garage -- and he did so without a government handout. ""Move over Joe the Plumber,"" one blog headline declared after his Elkhart appearance. ""There's a new poster child for hard-working Americans -- and he's green."" Keith's success story provided good publicity for the White House which called again and again, using Keith to underscore the Obama administration's goal of pushing America towards new sources of clean energy. ""'Can you come to Washington? Can you come to Philly? Biden doing this,'"" Keith said of the numerous requests he received from the administration. There's the photo of him with the president and Vice President Joe Biden in Kokomo, another Indiana city hard hit by the recession, as well as an appearance with Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and many others. Keith's story resonated with groups of all political stripes. Republicans got in on the act when Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar named him ""an energy patriot"" and the GOP-leaning U.S. Chamber of Commerce cited his work. Environmentalists also contacted him, and featured him in one appearance after another. Strange bedfellows, perhaps, but it was a feelgood story of what one American could do in a time when the recession was strangling so many. ""They were continually inviting me to these things called 'advocacy days' where they wanted me to meet with senators and congressmen,"" Keith said, noting that he attended many with his wife. At these events, lawmakers talked about ""how I created a solar product, how it's good for the environment, for business,"" he said. ""(I) won't say they were putting words in my mouth but they had a lot of talking points,"" Keith said. ""I was happy to do it from that point of view. It is friendly to the environment; it is creating jobs."" It also was good advertising for Keith, who could never have afforded the publicity these appearances offered. Orders for the fans, which retail at about $500, came pouring in from places as far away as Hawaii. ""It grew to where our peak was $2 million (in revenues),"" he said, referring to sales in 2009. SunRise Solar started exporting fans all over the world. While his home-based business employs only about 21 direct and indirect employees, it brought a much-needed economic boost to an area of the country hard hit by the recession. Today, Keith's solar star appears to be on a collision course with another Obama policy that may put him out of business. The irony is not lost on Keith: A man whose profile and company soared because of the administration's energy policy is now falling apart because of a new Obama anti-dumping policy involving China. While 95 percent of Keith's fans are American-made, he has yet to find a U.S. company that can make the small customized solar panels that make his fans run. It's not that he hasn't tried. He initially used a company in Michigan but they stopped manufacturing the kind of panels he needed. Then Keith turned to a New York company but the quality was so bad that he was replacing the defective parts faster than he could sell the fans. Over the years he begged environmental groups as well as the Commerce Department for help in finding an American company that could make the key solar component. Reluctantly, he agreed to purchase them from a major company in the United States, which bought their panels from another country and then had them customized in Hong Kong. Eventually that manufacturer told Keith to deal with the Hong Kong customizer directly. Keith said the U.S. Customs Department has accused him of using Chinese-made solar panels, in violation of a tough import policy adopted in May at the behest of major U.S. solar companies. The policy is intended to thwart China from undercutting prices and flooding the U.S. market with cheaper solar panels. The U.S. Department of Commerce is currently reviewing the policy, and is scheduled to make a determination in the fall. Keith denies that any of part of his solar fans are produced in China, but he admits he can't totally prove it. According to Keith, the owner of the Hong Kong company that customizes his solar cells has stated in an affadavit that it buys the cells from the United States, Taiwan and Germany. But Keith worries that testimony won't be good enough. ""The solar panel tariff is a broad-reaching tariff. In my estimation it shouldn't be geared toward small niche markets like mine,"" Keith said. Unless he can show specific manufacturing documentation by August 29, Keith said he could be fined as much as 250 percent on his solar panels -- an effective rate of $270,000. If that anti-dumping fine is levied, Keith said he will have to shutter his business. ""These guys are going to put me out of business,"" Keith said. ""I don't have any help. I've been trying to get help, no one can help me."" Keith said he has never received government financial assistance and is taxed in the 40 percent bracket. He said he has sat by and watched companies like the now bankrupt Solyndra run through taxpayers' money and not return on the government's investment. He said he doesn't want a handout -- just a helping hand. So he went back to the well one more time, pleading with Greg Nelson, deputy director of the White House Office of Public Engagement who Keith said had been his contact with the Obama administration. Under the subject line his e-mail to Nelson, Keith wrote, ""Hanging on for life here."" ""Can you help me before I have to close my doors and let everyone go?"" Keith asked in the e-mail. ""Please ... I'm pleading with you."" Nelson responded, ""Thanks for bringing it to my attention. I don't know what is possible, but let me talk to a few folks asap. Will circle back soon."" That was nearly a month ago and Keith is still waiting. CNN sent three e-mails to the White House asking about Keith's situation, and received a reply from a spokesman late Wednesday afternoon. The spokesman stated that the tariff ""highlights the degree to which solar panel manufacturers have faced unfair competition from countries like China"" and the president's move to impose a tax on Chinese-made goods is a way to establish ""a level playing field with China for American businesses and workers."" The reply did not address Keith's situation. ""When Obama came in office, there were a lot of small business owners who said, 'Hey maybe he'll help break barriers and help owners' or he says he will, but it never trickles down that far to help us,"" Keith said. ""Maybe it's because we don't have big budgets to donate to campaigns. I don't know. I'm just trying to run my company."" Romney sets goal of energy independence by 2020 .

"(CNN) -- Samsung says it expects to make a second quarter profit of US$5.9 billion, thanks largely to burgeoning sales of its flagship Galaxy smartphones. The record figure -- a 79% rise from a year earlier -- follows a remarkable first quarter performance, which saw the South Korean technology giant overtake rivals Apple and Nokia as the world's biggest phone vendor with 44.5 million handsets sold. Apple's sales of 35.1 million iPhones in the first quarter helped lead the company to double first quarter profits, while Nokia's 11.9 million sales January through March was almost half as many as the Finnish firm sold during the same period last year, eroding its smartphone market share to 8.2% from 23.5% in 2011. In May, Samsung released its new Galaxy S III phone in Europe and has seen brisk sales, which are expected to top 10 million units in July, according to the company's telecoms chief JK Shin. Analysts agree. ""The impact of the Galaxy S III smartphone was maximized thanks to its sole competitor Apple Inc.'s delay in releasing a new product,"" Shinhan Investment Corp. analyst Kim Young-chan said in a report, quoted by South Korea's Yonhap news agency. ""More than six million units of the latest Galaxy phone have been sold since its rollout in late May, with sales likely to top 25 million units in the second half,"" he added. Kim predicted Samsung would sell a total of 204 million smartphones in 2012. Apple, meanwhile, has still to set a date for its much-anticipated iPhone 5 -- seen by many as the challenger to the Galaxy S III. The California-based tech behemoth is also locked in a lengthy legal challenge with its Korean rival in the courts, with numerous patent infringement cases pending in over 10 different countries. Apple wins ban on two devices: What it means for you . Last week, a U.S. judge suspended sales of Samsung's Galaxy Nexus smartphone just days after issuing a similar ruling against its new Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet computer. San Jose District Judge Lucy Koh said Apple ""has shown a likelihood of establishing both infringement and validity."" Samsung is appealing both injunctions. The legal wrangling began in April 2011, when Apple launched a lawsuit accusing the South Korean company of ""slavishly"" copying the interface and design of the iPhone and iPad in Galaxy smartphones and tablets. Samsung countersued, saying Apple has infringed a number of its wireless patents. Samsung's results will be announced later this month.

"(CNN) -- Soccer stars will face a more systematic regime of drug testing following world governing body FIFA's decision to introduce biological profiles for players. The move comes as global sport is trying to crack down on drug cheats in the wake of recent doping scandals. Lance Armstrong's loss of his seven Tour de France titles, followed by his admission of using performance-enhancing substances in an interview with Oprah Winfrey, brought the problem of drug use by athletes to worldwide attention. And last week Australia was stunned by a government report which alleged many professional athletes are using forbidden drugs often supplied by organized crime groups. In Spain, the Operacion Puerto trial is now underway following an investigation, which began in 2006, into the widespread doping network operated by Dr. Eufemiano Fuentes. Now FIFA is taking steps to address any possible use of banned substances within football, announcing its plan to bring in biological profiles following discussions between president Sepp Blatter and his World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) counterpart John Fahey on Thursday. The profiles, similar to the biological passports used within cycling, will first be run at June's Confederations Cup -- a warmup tournament for the 2014 World Cup, also being held in Brazil. Biological profiles are built up by collating an athlete's drug test results over time, therefore making it easier to detect differences which could indicate the use of a banned substance. ""We are very interested in continuing the work on biological profiles,"" Fahey said in a FIFA statement released Friday. ""WADA is very satisfied with the commitment of FIFA on the biological profiles, which will be run not only at the FIFA World Cup in 2014 but already at the FIFA Confederations Cup in June this year."" In an interview with CNN, Fahey said he saw no reason why football and other major team sports couldn't introduce biological profiles. ""I would like to see, particularly team sports, take up the athlete's biological passport,"" said Fahey. ""There is absolutely no reason why not in the major codes of football, and in the major sporting events right throughout the world. ""That will do a lot to stamp out doping in sport, and most of those major codes can easily afford the cost of running (a biological passport) program and doing it well."" FIFA said a total of 662 urine samples had been taken across different competitions last year, namely the FIFA U-20 women's World Cup, FIFA U-17 women's World Cup, FIFA Futsal World Cup, FIFA Club World Cup, Brazil 2014 qualifiers and men's and women's Olympic football tournaments. ""To date, there has been one adverse analytical finding at a FIFA World Cup qualifier in October 2012,"" read the FIFA statement. ""We have been testing this at the FIFA Club World Cup in 2011 and 2012, we will continue at the FIFA Confederations Cup 2013 with blood testing unannounced at training camps and games,"" said FIFA's Medical Committee chairman Dr. Michel D'Hooghe. ""And it's our commitment to have all players participating at the 2014 FIFA World Cup having biological profiles."" FIFA said doping controls will be in place at 114 of the 820 qualifying matches for Brazil 2014 played worldwide, with 456 samples being taken. ""At these selected matches, four players are to undergo a doping control and out of those selected, one is drawn for EPO,"" continued the statement. EPO is a hormone which aids the production of red blood cells, helping athletes train harder for longer. ""There is always more which can be done in the fight against doping, but we know FIFA has always been serious in this domain,"" added Fahey in the statement. ""We think the leagues can complement what FIFA is already doing, but we came here to thank FIFA for its collaboration.""","FIFA will introduce biological passports to combat doping in football .

"(CNN) -- The 222nd El Clasico -- a match between Barcelona and Real Madrid which epitomizes the ultimate in team rivalry -- turned into an individual showcase for the two greatest players in world football and fittingly ended in a 2-2 draw Sunday. Barcelona's Lionel Messi scored twice to put his side 2-1 ahead in their Camp Nou Stadium after an early strike from Real's Cristiano Ronaldo. But the Portuguese star drew the reigning Spanish champions level on the hour mark with his second goal and almost certainly kept their title hopes alive. They trail leaders Barcelona by eight points after seven games, 11 would have been almost insurmountable. A draw was probably a fair result although it is unlikely the majority of the 98,000 fans who crammed into Barcelona's magnificent home stadium would have agreed. Because at stake is not just the result of a football match but the very pride and honor of the Catalan people. Independence calls . Many from this semi-autonomous region of Spain want full independence and last month more than a million people demanded just that in a demonstration in Barcelona. Former Barca manager Pepe Guardiola publicly supported that ambition, which has gathered pace in the austerity-hit country, with many Catalonia citizens believing they are paying more than their fair share into the coffers of the government in Madrid. This feeling of Catalan identity embodied in a football club is summed up by Barcelona's motto ""mes que un club"" -- more than a club, and clashes against Real Madrid are chances to give vent to their feelings. Austerity gives El Clasico added twist . The passionate atmosphere Sunday went up a notch as Barcelona officials allowed fans to display the yellow and red colors of Catalonia in a giant mosaic, holding up cards to get the effect. And at exactly 17 minutes and 14 seconds, chants for independence rang out in reference to the Catalans' military defeat to the Royalists in the War of Spanish Succession in 1714. Political football . Barcelona's central defender Gerard Pique had tweeted Saturday that he wanted politics to say out of El Clasico. ""The games between Barcelona and Madrid increasingly resemble Catalonia against Spain and this should not happen,"" he wrote. ""It's just a football match."" Whether all his fellow players agreed with Pique, they certainly missed him in defense as he was ruled out by injury. The full throated chants had barely subsided when Ronaldo ran through a big gap in the Barcelona back line and shot past Victor Valdes on 22 minutes. It was a record sixth goal in six matches against Barcelona and Real would be left to rue a miss by Karim Benzema soon afterwards which might have led to a different result. His mishit shot hit the post and by halftime Messi had equalized after hesitation in the Real defense. Is this El Clasico a must win game for Real? In the second half, Messi was fouled just outside the Real penalty area and got up to send an unstoppable free kick past Iker Casillas. But Ronaldo replied when weakness at the heart of the home defense was again evident and he equalized with a low shot. Both sides had chances to grab the three points but had to settle for a draw. Controversial invite . The political undertones behind the latest El Clasico found further expression in the decision by Barcelona to invite Gilad Shalit, a former Israeli soldier who was held captive in Gaza for nearly five years. It risked alienating their many supporters in the Palestine region and the Hamas government called for a boycott of the television coverage. Barcelona responded by inviting a former Palestine international player Mahmoud Sarsak, who had been detained by the Israelis, but he declined to come.","Barcelona draw 2-2 with Real Madrid in El Clasico .

"(CNN) -- A day on ... not a day off. These words are written on posters that fill the gymnasium of the King Center in Atlanta. They sit beside the image of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and are meant to inspire others to devote themselves to their ""beloved communities"" on the upcoming holiday. Young leaders from across Atlanta gathered this month during a celebration of the holiday to talk about how they are seeking change in their schools, homes and communities. ""The legacy of Dr. King is oneness in the community, everyone treating each other as they would want to be treated,"" said Monique Barashango, founder of Atlanta's ViZion Dance company. ""Living a life full of love, giving a helping hand wherever you see fit."" Barashango doesn't set aside one Monday a year to give back. The former substitute teacher tries to live in the spirit of King. Passionate yet soft-spoken, Barashango started the performance group when she spotted immense talent in a group of otherwise marginalized youth. ""Some of our children have gone through unimaginable circumstances, and our young adults as well,"" Barashango said. ""But they use their lives as living testimony so that others can live productive lives."" Chaz Wright is one of those offering testimony. A teen poet who started writing in the fifth grade, Wright believes in the power to change his community through spoken word. ""I realized that poetry is really something that people listen to, and I want to get the message out as many ways as I can,"" Wright said. From his poem ""Maturity"": . See now I'd rather have respect then some diamonds around my neck. I want to graduate top of my class. What most don't understand is high school isn't going to last forever. As president of the Stewart Foundation, which Wright says works to build leaders of tomorrow, this teen also lives the legacy of King. ""If you really want to make a change, you have to go out and make it happen yourself. You can't expect somebody else to do it."" What does he hope for Monday? ""I would encourage everybody on this holiday to go out and actually try to make a difference in the world,"" Wright said. Princess Starr encounters talented teens like Wright as co-founder of the Young Voices United Performing Arts School in suburban Atlanta. The former Spelman College music major says her family helps give back to the community in the tradition of King. ""We can bring our youth in and actually teach them life skills through a performing art,"" Starr said. ""We are helping to carry on the dream that Dr. King articulated to let our kids know that they can do anything, they can be anything."" Her words of advice: ""Go out and do something for someone. Be a light to somebody."" Looking for inspiration for your day on?

"(CNN) -- Ford's Europe boss says the car giant is sticking with the UK despite the slumping currency and friction with European partners. Stephen Odell -- chief executive officer of the U.S. automaker's European division -- told CNN the debate over a UK referendum on EU membership is not an ""inhibitor"" to Ford's investment strategy in the short term. U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron is pledging to offer the British electorate a vote by 2017 on whether Europe's second largest economy remains in the 27-nation political union. In January, Cameron said the British people should have a choice about whether to remain in the EU on the basis of a renegotiated settlement -- or to leave. The referendum should not be held until it's clear how changes made after the crisis in the eurozone work out, he said. Speaking from the Geneva Motor Show in Switzerland, Odell told CNN: ""I hope sense prevails as we start to move potentially towards a referendum."" He added: ""From a business perspective to elect and decide to vote to move away from 50% of your business partnership doesn't strike me as a very good view."" Odell also said the weak pound would not deter Ford's operation in the UK. Sterling is under pressure as investors anticipate new stimulus measures from the Bank of England. ""The U.K. [car] industry last year was quite buoyant because the pound was strong against the euro but I don't think that's a principle driver of our decision,"" said Odell. This week Ford is launching its new Tourneo Courier at the Geneva Motor Show, with the people carrier set to hit UK showrooms next spring. Odell says Ford is already beginning to see encouraging signs in sales in the European car industry.

"(CNN) -- There was a time, as she emerged from the rubble of the 2008 campaign, when Sarah Palin was the hottest cultural figure in America. People loved her. People hated her. She had transcended the narrow bounds of politics to become a larger-than-life figure, the woman portrayed by Tina Fey, the mama grizzly from Alaska. Every journalist in the country knew that if you put Palin's name in an online headline or television segment, your clicks and ratings would soar. Little wonder that Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes rushed to sign her as a million-dollar-a-year contributor and built a modern studio for Palin in her Wasilla home. By the time word trickled out Friday that Palin's contract would not be renewed, the reaction was a collective shrug. Her moment had passed. And therein lies a lesson -- about the fleeting nature of fame but also about the nature of media commentary. News: Palin speaks out after leaving Fox . The exiled-politician-turned-pundit has been a growing staple of cable news. CNN began the tradition by returning Pat Buchanan to ""Crossfire"" in between his presidential runs. MSNBC is packed with such Democratic figures as Al Sharpton, Ed Rendell and Howard Dean. And for a time as the 2012 campaign approached, the Fox payroll included no fewer than four potential presidential candidates: Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee and Palin. The former vice-presidential nominee was both newsmaker and news commentator, staging a New Hampshire bus tour in the summer of 2011 to flirt with the idea of making a White House bid, though it was all for show. But Palin never quite had the impact of, say, a Karl Rove as a Fox talking head. She became something of a one-note wonder, jabbing at President Barack Obama for failing to deliver on the hope-y change-y thing but reluctant to challenge her fellow Republicans, especially after Mitt Romney rolled to the nomination. It wasn't clear what Palin stood for. She also reflexively jabbed the media (except for Fox), seemingly more interested in settling scores than driving an agenda. As Palin appeared from Alaska with less frequency, she became less a part of the national conversation. The future seemed limitless in 2009, when Palin wrote a book that was a monster best-seller and starred in a TLC reality series about Alaska. Her daughter Bristol would become a ""Dancing With the Stars"" celebrity (though this would prove to be a mixed blessing). And the former half-term governor was a force in the 2010 midterm elections, even while holding forth on Fox. A low point came after the Gabby Giffords shooting, when some commentators unfairly tried to link Palin to the tragedy by noting that her political committee had (unwisely) put out a map with the contests involving the Arizona congresswoman and other Democrats marked with crosshairs. Against the advice of Ailes, Palin lashed out in a Facebook video, accusing critics of a ""blood libel"" and sparking a debate over whether she was likening herself to centuries of anti-Semitism against Jews. By 2012, tea party fervor had faded, and the GOP had moved on from the Palin era. The movie ""Game Change"" depicted Palin as a temperamental and ignorant candidate who wasn't much interested in learning. And Fox itself, after parting company with Glenn Beck, edged away from the hard right. During the Republican National Convention, Palin complained one night that Fox had canceled her appearances. When her three-year deal was up, Ailes offered Palin a new contract -- but at a fraction of her seven-figure salary. It was a lowball offer, and both sides agreed to an amicable separation. In an interview with Breitbart.com, Palin talks about broadening her audience, saying: ""I know the country needs more truth-telling in the media, and I'm willing to do that."" Palin still has a passionate following and can still make news with a single Facebook posting. But for Fox News, at least, her market value had clearly plunged, and a divorce was inevitable.

"Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) -- The Myanmar government, which has freed hundreds of detainees in recent years, is setting up a committee to look into releasing political prisoners after long refusing to admit they were being held in the Southeast Asian country's jails. President Thein Sein, whose government has introduced a string of political reforms that have led to improved ties with Western nations, ordered the establishment of the committee to define the term ""political prisoner"" and review relevant cases, authorities said Thursday. Terrorized, starving and homeless: Myanmar's Rohingya still forgotten . Myanmar is gradually emerging from decades of authoritarian military rule that resulted in internal oppression and international isolation. Thein Sein, a former military official, has overseen the introduction of greater political freedoms, peace talks with ethnic rebels and the successful participation of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her party in legislative elections. Western governments have responded by easing economic sanctions and stepping up diplomatic ties. In November, President Barack Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Myanmar, giving a powerful symbolic nod to its fledgling reforms. Friday, the United States welcomed news of the committee's formation. ""By establishing an inclusive, transparent review mechanism to ensure the release of all remaining political prisoners, the government has taken an important step towards national reconciliation,"" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. From Burma to Myanmar: Land of rising expectations . Doubts still remain about the commitment to lasting reform by officials in Myanmar, also known as Burma, in the light of sectarian unrest in the western state of Rakhine, recent fighting between the military and ethnic rebels in Kachin, and a heavy crackdown on protesters outside a copper mine project. A stumbling block in talks . One stumbling block the Myanmar government has come up against in talks with other political parties and governments is its refusal to use the term ""political prisoner"" to describe some of those behind bars, according to Ye Htut, a spokesman for the president. Myanmar: Testing the limits of reform . ""We cannot negotiate because of this term,"" he said by phone. ""That's why President Thein Sein instructed to form this committee to find the definition."" The government, which pledged to set up such a mechanism during Obama's visit, says it hopes the committee will include representatives from other political parties and groups representing political prisoners. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), a prisoner rights and support group, said the government had invited it to help with the committee's work. The initiative is ""a good sign,"" said Bo Kyi, joint secretary of AAPP, which is run by former political prisoners. But he added that ""we have to wait and see until more political prisoners are released."" Hundreds believed to still be in prison . Aung San Suu Kyi spent many years under house arrest before authorities released her in 2011. A lot of members of her party, the National League for Democracy, were imprisoned under the military junta. The new committee will try to determine the the number of political prisoners being held in Myanmar, Ye Htut said, noting that the government had received different estimates from different organizations. ""The president also wants to release more political prisoners to implement national reconciliation,"" he added. As many as several hundred political prisoners remain behind bars in Myanmar, Human Rights Watch, a U.S.-based advocacy group, said in a report last week. Furthermore, it said, ""freed political prisoners face restrictions on travel and education, and lack adequate psychosocial support."" Asked whether he would visit political prisoners around Myanmar, Bo Kyi of AAPP said he would rather ""see my colleagues outside, not in the jails."" Journalist Phyo Wai Lin reported from Yangon, and CNN's Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Kocha Olarn in Bangkok, Thailand, contributed to this report.","NEW: United States lauds ""important step""

"(CNN) -- For the first time since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Christine Wilford plans do something remarkable on Thursday that once was routine: drop her child off at school. The last time her 7-year-old son, Richie, was in class was on December 14, when a gunman smashed his way into his school in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 26 children and adults. As shots rang out, Richie's teacher locked the door and huddled her students into the corner as the shooter roamed the hallways, wielding an AR-15 assault rifle and firing. When it appeared safe, the children were then hurried away to a nearby fire station, where teary parents either reunited with their sons and daughters or learned that they had been killed. Nearly a month later, Wilford said her son still has trouble sleeping and is often scared by loud noises. Newtown chooses faith, charity, hope . But on Thursday, he will join hundreds of other Newtown students returning to class for the first time since the tragedy. ""We think it's good he's going back,"" Wilford said. ""If I leave my child anywhere, I'm leaving a piece of my heart, so it's difficult to leave him."" But Richie apparently isn't afraid and says he's looking forward to seeing his friends, she said. They won't be attending Sandy Hook Elementary, which police say remains part of an ongoing investigation into Adam Lanza, the gunman who also killed his mother before opening fire at the school. Instead, Richie and his classmates are expected to travel to Chalk Hill Middle School in the nearby town of Monroe, where a green-and-white banner greeting the children hangs on a fence. Survivor's attorney withdraws lawsuit . Newtown Public Schools Superintendent Janet Robinson said that part of the building had been transformed to resemble an elementary school. ""(We want) to have as much (of) a normal routine as possible,"" she said. ""Tomorrow is a regular schedule, and we will do the kinds of things that we know are good for kids."" The school has also been outfitted with rugs and furniture similar to those at Sandy Hook to help ease the transition for students. Even the school's pet turtle was relocated, Robinson said. Security measures have also been increased, with a new system incorporating more cameras and locks, according to Jim Agostine, superintendent of Monroe Public Schools. ""I think right now it has to be the safest school in America,"" added Monroe Police Lieutenant Keith White.

"(CNN) -- A 2010 video of an airport screener patting down a 3-year-old boy in a wheelchair has become the latest Rorschach test of the public's attitude towards the TSA, pitting agency defenders against those who say the video shows the child being treated like a terrorist. Posted on YouTube Saturday night by the child's father, the video had nearly 100,000 hits by Monday evening. Matt Dubiel, the father of Rocco Dubiel, videotaped the incident in the spring of 2010 at Chicago's Midway International Airport. He posted the video after rediscovering it last week, saying he became enraged anew when reviewing it. ""There is another human being putting their hands on my child. That is not acceptable,"" he said. ""If he was putting his hands on my child at McDonald's or anyplace else, we would immediately have him arrested and call the police."" The Transportation Security Administration noted the agency has changed its procedures since 2010 and said pat downs of children 12 and younger are unlikely, although still possible, under the new protocols. Under the new TSA policy that took effect in September, screeners can work with parents to resolve alarms at security checkpoints. Among other options, screeners can have the children go through metal detectors or body scanners multiple times or can swab their hands to test for traces of explosives. ""The new modified screening measures have greatly reduced, though not eliminated, pat downs of children,"" TSA spokesman Greg Soule said. ""While recognizing that terrorists are willing to manipulate societal norms to evade detection, our officers continue to work with parents to ensure a respectful screening process for the entire family at the checkpoint."" Children in wheelchairs continue to present special challenges, since the metal chairs trigger alarms in metal detectors and scanners. That increases the likelihood of alternate screening methods being used, including limited pat downs, to find the small amounts of explosives experts say could bring down a plane. Dubiel said he faults the TSA, not the individual screener, who he said tried to calm his son. But ""I think the whole exercise was intrusive and disrespectful to a human being, and a 3-year-old human being,"" he told CNN. The videotape shows the screener lifting the young boy's shirt to briefly swab his back, apparently straying from normal TSA protocols. Typically, screeners would only swab a person's hands and articles of clothing or items they are carrying. Dubiel said the screening occurred when his family was departing for a trip to Disney World. ""I tape-recorded it because I wanted to let the gentleman know that was examining my son that there was a camera on him, and anything that he was going to do, that he needed to be comfortable doing on camera. And if he wasn't, he needed to stay away from it."" Dubiel said he was told he could not stand next to his son during the search. ""I was told I couldn't comfort or hug my son. I couldn't hug him. I couldn't hold his hand,"" he said. ""And I tried to make the best out of it. But as I'm standing there as a parent doing this, I'm thinking about, should I do something more? Should I not?"" Dubiel said he disapproved of the pat down, but did not immediately object because he feared the consequences. ""My fear was, if I made a bigger deal out of it, then I could be detained, or we could miss our flight, or we could miss our vacation. All of these things are dancing around in my head,"" he said. Dubiel said he forgot about the videotape, but stumbled upon it Saturday. ""As we watched it, I felt like I was in the moment again,"" he said. ""I was overcome with the same emotion I felt -- anger and sadness and frustration. ""The more I thought about it, the more I thought, 'I'm going to share this,'"" Dubiel said. ""I wanted to share with other parents and let them see firsthand what happened."" In hindsight, he said, he regrets that he didn't stop the pat down. ""There hasn't been one instance in the United States of a 3-year-old carrying explosives onto an airplane or doing ill will to anyone,"" he said. Like some other TSA controversies, this one resulted in heated commentary on the many Internet sites that featured the video. ""Totally unacceptable,"" wrote one YouTube commentator. ""I look at the abject terror in this tiny child's eyes, and I know who caused it. I know who the terrorist is -- it's the creep in the blue shirt."" ""I don't think a man can be called a creep ... for doing what his job requires him to do, especially since he could be easily fired for not following the rules,"" another viewer responded. The TSA, meanwhile, said a new TSA Cares hotline now serves as a resource for passengers with disabilities, medical conditions or other circumstances or their loved ones who want to prepare for the screening process prior to flying. TSA recommends that passengers call approximately 72 hours ahead of travel so that TSA Cares has the opportunity to coordinate checkpoint support with a TSA Customer Service Manager located at the airport when necessary. Travelers can contact the TSA, using Talk To TSA -- a web-based tool that allows passengers to reach out to an airport customer service manager directly. They can also reach the TSA Contact Center at 1-866-289-9673 or via e-mail at TSA-ContactCenter@dhs.gov, with questions, suggestions or to file complaints.","The TSA has changed its screening procedures since 2010 .

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is one of the leading leftist figures in Latin America and one of the United States' most vocal critics, aligning himself with former Cuban President Fidel Castro and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. With a win in Sunday's elections, the 58-year-old Chavez, who has been in power since 1999, will enter a fourth term in office and extend his presidency into 2019, or two full decades in power. Hugo Chavez wins re-election . When first elected on December 6, 1998, in a landslide, Chavez was at age 44 the youngest person in the nation's history to become president. Between June 2011 and May 2012, he underwent cancer treatment in Cuba, raising speculation about his political future and a possible successor when he named 10 people to his inner circle of advisers, known as the Council of State. But the following month he announced his re-election bid, and in July this year he declared himself cancer-free. In a country where more than a quarter live in poverty, the charismatic Chavez has inspired ""fierce loyalty"" among the poor thanks largely to his social programs, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. His socialist agenda has also overseen the nationalization of property and firms in numerous industries, such as finance, agribusiness, construction, oil, steel and gold. Chavez himself came from a modest background -- born the son of schoolteachers on July 28, 1954 in Sabaneta, a city in Venezuela's Barinas state. From a young age he was influenced by Simon Bolivar, the Venezuelan soldier and politician who led the Latin American independence movement against Spain during the early 19th century. Chavez would style himself in the Bolivar mold, dubbing his own revolution ""Chavismo."" His legacy will be one of both ""self-styled Latin American Robin Hood"" and ""shrewd autocrat using and abusing his country's oil riches to stay in power,"" CNN's Paula Newton wrote. According to the World Bank, oil accounts for more than 30% of Venezuela's gross domestic product, 90% of its exports and 50% of fiscal income. Chavez's political and professional ascent was a colorful one. An avid baseball player, he had once dreamed of a baseball career but joined the army after graduating from the Military Academy of Venezuela in Caracas in 1975. Five colorful quotes from Hugo Chavez . Amid festering social tensions in 1992, Chavez, by then a lieutenant colonel, led an unsuccessful coup against President Carlos Andres Perez for which he was imprisoned for two years. Upon his release by the new President Rafael Caldera Rodriguez, Chavez formed the opposition Fifth Republic Movement, a vehicle for him to criticize government corruption and the two-party system. He cast himself as the anti-establishment figure, vowing to dissolve Congress and redistribute the nation's oil wealth. Voters responded, catapulting him to the presidency. After being sworn into office in February 1999, his government created a new constitution that required a ""mega-election"" in 2000 for every elected official. It was under this new constitution that Chavez was reelected to a six-year presidency in 2000. But within two years, he faced major setbacks as opposition to his social agenda grew, culminating in massive protests and a coup in 2002. Although the military had been behind Chavez's removal, his replacement, Pedro Carmona, would dissolve the National Assembly and suspend the constitution, leading the military to force Carmona himself to resign. In a series of musical chairs, Chavez's vice president, Diosdado Cabello, was sworn in as president, after which he immediately restored Chavez to power. These events took place over four days. Another showdown came in the form of a presidential recall referendum in 2004. Chavez survived that one too. Chavez, known for marathon speeches, has long been a critic of the United States. He was a particularly vocal opponent of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in the wake of the 2001 terror attacks and of the Iraq war. In 2006, he rebuked then-President George W. Bush in a speech at the U.N. General Assembly, stating, ""The devil came here yesterday, and it smells of sulfur still today."" He has also speculated that Washington was behind the cancer that afflicted five Latin American presidents, including himself, in recent years. By the end of 2006, Chavez would be re-elected to his third term, with a little less than two-thirds of the vote. His term would see the passage of more constitutional changes, including indefinite re-election, as well as the stifling of political dissent, such as the closure of opposition radio stations and moves against private broadcaster Globovision. He would also strengthen relations with Iran -- a country he has visited nine times and with which Venezuela has signed more than 270 accords. Of the four nations on Ahmadinejad's Latin American tour earlier this year, Venezuela was the first. Chavez has been married twice and has five children.","Chavez's socialist agenda has overseen nationalization in numerous industries .

"(CNN) -- If Black Friday lines and stories of violence, vehicular assault and child abandonment taught us anything, it's that the holiday shopping season is a dark, competitive time. Now search engines are getting into the cutthroat holiday spirit. In a new attack on Google, Microsoft's Bing search engine accuses its rival's Google Shopping tool of being dishonest by only including paying vendors, ranking listings by how much they pay, and not clearly marking the results as sponsored. To make its point, Bing has launched a detailed site accusing Google Search of unsavory business practices and coined a new word: Scroogled. ""In the beginning, Google preached, 'Don't be evil' -- but that changed on May 31, 2012. That's when Google Shopping announced a new initiative. Simply put, all of their shopping results are now paid ads,"" reads the campaign's mission statement. It goes on to say ""when you limit choices and rank them by payment, consumers get Scroogled."" The accusations are based on real changes. To appear in Google Shopping results, merchants must now pay for Google's Product Listing Ads. The company publicly announced the switch from free listings to a paid-inclusion system in May, and the transition was completed on October 17 in the United States. The new Google Shopping will roll out in more countries starting in February. ""The primary point is, we think they should stop the practice of pay to rank, or at least make it very clear what's going on,"" said Stefan Weitz, senior director at Bing. Bing's own search results also include results from companies that have paid to be listed. Weitz says the majority of its listings are from vendors that signed up for free, but it also includes products from third-party aggregators like the eBay-owned Shopping.com. Bing has actually shut down its free sign-up for the holiday season, and any new vendors interested in being listed are directed to Shopping.com, where they will have to pay to be included in search results. Bing does not visually differentiate between the free and paid listings, so shoppers don't know if a vendor paid to be listed. But the search engine also doesn't use any of that information to determine its rankings. By default, both sites sort shopping search results by their own custom ""relevancy"" algorithms. Google's now weighs relevancy by how much a vendor bids, though it also takes into account quality and how relevant the results are to the search terms. To get past this biased listing, searchers can choose to sort by price. ""If you actually were looking at pure price, they would be more comparable,"" said Weitz. The disclosures that all Google Shopping results are paid are somewhat hidden. On the main Google Shopping page, a disclaimer that Google is ""compensated by some"" vendors is buried at the bottom of the page. Search results are formatted to look like a typical Google results page, and you must click on a link that says ""Why these products?"" to see a similar disclaimer. (Bing's big Scroogled marketing push might actually address this problem for Google. Now, everyone will know they're paid.) By working closely with vendors instead of scraping public product feeds, Google is attempting to tap into more current data, with up-to-date inventory and price information. As a result, the quality of the individual product search results should improve. The trade-off is that it is missing some major retailers that do not want to pay to play, most notably Google's actual biggest competitor when it comes to online shopping, Amazon. Bing Shopping still includes Amazon results, but Amazon has positioned itself as an entry point for online shoppers in direct competition with Google and Bing. A Forrester report released in July found that 30% of online shoppers start researching products on Amazon, while only 13% started on Google. The Scroogled page claims the exclusion of free listings could result in ""not getting the best price when you thought you were,"" but cursory test searches of major tech products found prices were comparable on both sites. A camera might have a lower price on one, and a tablet come in a few bucks cheaper on the other. Google Shopping claims a larger volume of product choices than Bing's product tool. Google Shopping currently has around 100,000 vendors and over a billion products in its listings. Bing has 15,000 vendors and ""hundreds of millions"" of products. The Scroogled.com page is just one part of a spirited national campaign that will include digital, print and TV ads that attempt to vilify the first-place search engine. ""This was meant to be a fairly lighthearted holiday campaign,"" explained Weitz. He clarified that Scroggled is a reference to Ebenezer Scrooge, not the similar sounding naughty verb. Seasonal hijinks aside, Weitz said he has real concerns that this could be the start of a trend at Google, spreading to other Google services such as news. Google is not addressing the Scroogled attack directly, but did release a statement touting the benefits of its Shopping service, saying, ""With new 360-degree, interactive product images, social shopping lists and a fast growing inventory of more than a billion products worldwide, Google is a great resource for shoppers to find what they need."" Luckily, with access to browsers that support multiple tabs and basic math skills, shoppers can easily comparison shop their comparison shopping tools.","Google Shopping is the target of a nationwide attack ad from Microsoft's Bing search engine .

"(CNN) -- If Monday's inauguration displayed the gushing, ceremonial aspect of American democracy, Wednesday revealed its more sober and confrontational side -- a Senate committee hearing. The hearing was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton vs. the Republicans on the painful subject of Benghazi, Libya. After a lot of anger from the senators and a surprising amount of emotion from Clinton, the final score was a draw. But some Republicans did better than others, and Clinton probably emerges with a healthier reputation than the administration that she's leaving. Moreover, the debate throws up some tantalizing ""what ifs"" about 2016. Is America ready for Hillary Clinton vs. Rand Paul? To take Clinton first, it's remarkable how much her role as secretary of state has transformed her. Five things we learned from the Benghazi hearings . To conservatives, she was once the Lady Macbeth of liberalism; the feminist power behind Bill Clinton's throne whose every utterance seemed calculated to upset the right. Her book ""It Takes a Village"" was greeted like a manifesto of anti-American collectivism -- so much so that Rick Santorum felt compelled to pen a response called ""It Takes a Family."" But secretaries of state often find themselves elevated from partisan politics in to the heavenly realm of ""national interest"" (think Henry Kissinger or Colin Powell), and therein Clinton has redefined herself as a competent and admirable public servant. Consider John McCain's first words at the Senate hearing: ""We thank you for your outstanding and dedicated service to this nation and ... all over the world where I travel, you are viewed with admiration and respect."" Given her extraordinary hard work and efforts to advance the rights of women and children, she has certainly earned that respect. It's found in ample supply at home, too. According to Gallup, the former controversialist is now America's ""most admired woman."" But even if Clinton did get through the hearing with her reputation intact, that doesn't mean that Benghazi doesn't leave scars on the administration. The critical -- and most electric -- round of questioning was started by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin. He demanded to know why Clinton didn't try to find out what was really happening on the ground sooner and why the administration persisted so long in refusing to label the Benghazi incident a ""terrorist attack."" Opinion: Benghazi blame-game is useless . Clinton's defense was similar to Obama's during the presidential election: something went wrong, we didn't want to interfere with ground operations and it took a long time to gather the intelligence to know what really happened. But Clinton lost her cool and summed up that position in a breathtakingly callous phrase: ""What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator."" All the difference in the world, I would imagine, to the relatives of the personnel who died. This rare loss of composure perhaps underlines the weakness of the administration's case. The White House seems to think -- as John Hayward at the Conservative website Human Events puts it bluntly -- ""the game ends when they say the magic phrase 'I take responsibility,' and they win."" But it does not. Part of ""learning"" from the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi is admitting the basic errors that were made and providing the public with a clearer narrative of what really happened. But all we have at the moment are a catalog of errors that make up a very confusing story. It's obvious that the political situation in Libya is not more stable since Moammar Gadhafi was removed from office (just ask any Algerian), that insufficient security was provided at the consulate, that the administration fumbled its explanation of what occurred on September 11, 2012, that the rescue operation was delayed and that the CIA had some shadowy role to play in the whole mess. Clinton's assurance that ""I do feel responsible"" is not reason enough to stop asking these questions and just move on. Who then made the best case for the prosecution from the Republican side? Given that Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was participating, it felt at moments like an audition for 2016 -- and Rubio's staff put the video of his questions up on his website with remarkable speed. Clinton lays out daunting security challenges in North Africa . But the most impressive performance by far was from Rand Paul. He delivered a cool, withering statement that climaxed in this devastating paragraph (and you have to watch it to get the full effect): ""I'm glad that you're accepting responsibility. I think ultimately with your leaving that you accept the culpability for the worst tragedy since 9/11. And I really mean that. Had I been president and found you did not read the cables from Benghazi and from Ambassador (Christopher) Stevens, I would have relieved you of your post. I think it's inexcusable."" This performance might be -- and should be -- remembered well by the Republican base when the primary campaign of 2016 starts. Ever since the last president election, Rand Paul hasn't set a foot wrong. From his bridge-building visit to Israel to his opposition to the fiscal cliff deal, he seems well placed to become the tea party candidate. And what an unusually satisfying choice Clinton vs. Paul would be. It would be a genuine contest between big government liberalism and small government conservatism: Clinton's internationalism and support for welfare programs vs. Paul's anti-interventionism and opposition to pork. The question of who could win such an unusual contest is difficult to answer. The Paul family has a tradition of winning votes from Democrats, but Clinton's new respectability could also pull votes away from the Republicans. One Kentucky poll found that in a head-to-head contest, she'd even beat Rand in his home state of Kentucky. It would be a campaign that any elections scholar would relish. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Stanley.","Timothy Stanley: Benghazi hearing with Secretary Clinton was emotional, confrontational .

"Canton, Massachusetts (CNN) -- A Massachusetts judge on Thursday unsealed testimony by Mitt Romney in a lawsuit linked to a colleague's contentious divorce battle more than 20 years ago. The Boston Globe, with the support of attorney Gloria Allred, sought to make public the testimony Romney gave in the lawsuit that followed the divorce between Tom Stemberg, a co-founder of business supply chain Staples, and Maureen Stemberg Sullivan. While heading Boston private equity firm Bain Capital, Romney worked closely in the 1980s with Stemberg in the development of Staples. Stemberg spoke at the Republican National Convention in August that nominated Romney for president. A Massachusetts state court judge, Jennifer Ulwick, granted the Boston Globe's request for the testimony, but refused to lift a gag order that prevents Stemberg Sullivan from talking about her dealings and interactions with Romney. Lawyers for Stemberg and Romney told Thursday's hearing they had no objection to releasing the Romney testimony to the Boston Globe. Ulwick said the Romney testimony was being released to the newspaper without restrictions. Allred announced after the hearing she would provide copies of the Romney transcripts to other media outlets. The Boston Globe petitioned the court on October 15 to release Romney's testimony in the lawsuit filed in 1990, but Ulwick said at an initial hearing on Wednesday that she believed the documents had been destroyed. However, Allred and Stemberg Sullivan urged the court to agree to the newspaper's request and, in a surprise move, provided two volumes of Romney's testimony to the court. Stemberg's attorney also admitted to having additional transcripts from the decades-old case. Allred revealed Thursday that her office discovered a third volume of testimony overnight and was additionally seeking to amend the original gag order in the divorce proceedings that date back to 1989. ""My client has been denied her First Amendment right,"" Allred said. ""She apparently is the only person the United States of America, maybe even the world, who cannot speak about Governor Romney."" Ulwick refused to rule on the request to modify or lift the gag order, saying the only motion before the court was the newspaper's request for the testimony.

"Madrid (CNN) -- Spain's unemployment rate has climbed to its highest level ever, the Spanish government said Thursday, as a painful recession takes a toll on the debt-stricken nation. The latest official figures show 26.02% of the population without jobs in the last quarter of 2012, with just over 55% of those aged 16 to 24 unemployed. Explore our interactive: Europe's decade: A tale of boom and bust . The unemployment rate is the highest in the country's history, according to the Spanish National Statistics Institute, with the total number of jobless people at 5.97 million. In 2007, before the global economic crisis hit, Spain had 1.9 million people unemployed -- 8.6% of the active population. By this time last year, the number had climbed to 5.2 million.

But it has stopped short of following in the footsteps of Greece, Ireland and Portugal in requesting a full-blown sovereign bailout. Successive rounds of austerity measures have prompted angry public protests on Spain's streets.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- They may be a far cry from their Western counterparts fighting for the acceptance to breast-feed -- or go topless -- in public, but two girls clobbered a cleric recently in a small town in Iran when he admonished one of them to cover herself more completely. The cleric said he asked ""politely,"" but the girl's angry reaction and some pugilistic double-teaming with her friend landed the holy man in the hospital, according to an account Monday in the semiofficial Mehr News Agency. Hojatoleslam Ali Beheshti said he encountered the girls on his way to the mosque in the village of Shahmirzad for noon prayers in late August. Women's bodies: The public perception of private parts . He told one of the girls to cover up, the report said. ""She responded by telling me to cover my eyes, which was very insulting to me,"" Beheshti said. So he asked her a second time to cover up and also to put a lid on what he felt was verbal abuse. She hit the man of the cloth, and he hit the ground. ""I don't remember what happened after that,"" he said. ""I just felt her kicks and heard her insults."" Beheshti, who emerged from the infirmary three days later, said he did not file a complaint against the girls. But he doesn't mind the local prosecutor's investigation into the matter either ""as long as the case helps the cause of Islamic hijab.""

"(Ars Technica) -- After months of fanfare and anticipation, gigabit home Internet service Google Fiber finally went live on Tuesday in Kansas City. The search giant is offering 1 Gbps speeds for just $70 per month -- significantly faster and cheaper than what any traditional American ISPs are offering. ""We just got it today and I've been stuck in front of my laptop for the last few hours,"" Mike Demarais, founder of Threedee, told Ars. ""It's unbelievable. I'm probably not going to leave the house."" He lives in a four-bedroom house run by ""Homes For Hackers"" on Kansas City's Hanover Heights neighborhood, just on the state border with Missouri. The house has become one of the hubs for the KC Startup Village, an informal group of entrepreneurs who have clustered around homes immediately eligible for Google Fiber. Five cool things about Google Fiber . Meanwhile, Demarais said that on an Ethernet connection, he's seen consistent Google Fiber speeds of 600 to 700 Mbps, with Wi-Fi topping out around 200 Mbps. Even at the slower wireless speeds, that's more than an order of magnitude faster than what most Americans have at home. ""The first thing I did was BitTorrent Ubuntu,"" he said. ""I think that took two minutes, let me try it again right now."" Prior to Tuesday, Demarais—one of the house's first two residents—said he'd been working out of local McDonald's and Panera locations for their free Wi-Fi. Mi Wi-Fi es tu Wi-Fi . The Homes For Hackers, founded by local Web developer Ben Barreth, had originally been conceived as a matchmaking scheme between entrepreneurs who wanted a free place to live and work, and local families who would open their homes to them. (Ars covered that effort back in August.) But once Google announced its fiber rollout schedule, Barreth realized the families that had signed up were not going to get crazy speeds until Summer 2013. So he took matters into his own hands and, with his wife's blessing, he liquidated his Roth IRA to put 20 percent down on a house they eventually bought for $48,000 in September 2012. The couple has no plans to profit from the house. Instead, they want to use it as a way to nurture Kansas City's nascent tech community. He's letting entrepreneurs like Demarais live in the house rent-free and utilities-free for three months—they just have to pay for their own groceries. ""We're strong, devout Christians,"" Barreth told Ars. ""I've been pushing on doors and a lot of doors have opened for me. I feel like this is what I'm supposed to do right now. It doesn't make a lot of financial sense but I really think it will benefit Kansas City. The whole reason why [we bought the house] was that no one in Kansas City was really exploiting fiber like we could be and this is the way I can bring in individuals that will exploit it. It helps that it's not a really expensive house. [My wife] is a stay-at-home mom with two kids too, so we're living off my one salary, and it's still a strain. It's a still a big strain."" He anticipates getting donations, sponsorships, or, the most-likely scenario, renting out one of the bedrooms via AirBnB to the first Google Fiber ""tourists""—people who might want to come for a day or two at a time to try it out. ""$50 a night for 10 nights a month would cover mortgage and most of the utilities,"" he said. Barreth has been so busy dealing with local media requests that he hasn't yet had a chance to use the connection himself—he and his family live about 20 minutes away from the second house, and their neighborhood was not included in the first rollout regions. Kansas City, setting itself apart . Demarais said he knew he's been spoiled: ""Wherever I go after this, my Internet speed is going to be ruined."" His company, Threedee, hopes to provide an added benefit to the growing 3D printing ecosystem. ""We're building a front-end dev toolkit that lets developers view and manipulate 3D models in a browser,"" he said. ""We have an API that lets you communicate those models directly to 3D printers entirely in javascript without need to convert to a 3D model. We want to shake up manufacturing with tools that will allow people to buy products made for them."" Demarais moved to Kansas City from Boston to work on his new startup—and while the move was driven in part by Google Fiber, being able to live rent-free for 90 days was huge. He had considered staying home in Boston or moving to San Francisco, but both cities are notoriously expensive. ""I don't want to raise capital yet and it's hard to do that if I would need to get a part-time job just to pay rent,"" he added. ""All of that stuff is taken care for me, that was the big thing. People are too quick to discredit the value of a free-rent environment with like-minded people. KC needs to separate itself from the other scenes. ""Why here? Fiber is not enough. I think you need to have a dense startup community, and if young people are not moving here and trying to start startups, you need to artificially create that flow.""

"(CNN) -- Colombian authorities have captured the leader of a criminal group that once worked for Pablo Escobar, a police spokesman said Wednesday. The arrest of John Ericson Vargas Cardona was announced by Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, who called it a ""big blow against criminality."" Vargas Cardona, alias ""Sebastian,"" is the leader of a group called the Oficina de Envigado, once affiliated with the kingpin Escobar and now a drug trafficking organization in its own right. He was captured Wednesday morning by an elite group of police in the department of Antioquia, in northwest Colombia, police said. Santos' official Twitter account proclaimed it a ""triple jump against this criminal organization and gold medal for the police."" According to InSight Crime, a Colombia- and U.S.-based research and investigation outfit that monitors criminal groups, the Oficina de Envigado, named after a small city in the Medellin metropolitan area, are the inheritors of Escobar's drug trafficking empire. Today, the group is ""a hodgepodge of smaller organizations that seeks alliances with street gangs to keep control of their territory and businesses,"" according to an InSight Crime profile of the group. ""It is in near constant flux."" It is one of two rival groups fighting a turf war in Medellin that has seen violence in the area rise. In 2011, when a U.S. investigation led to charges against 20 people linked to the cartel, a U.S. attorney referred to the Oficina de Envigado as ""one of the largest and most dangerous drug cartels in Colombia."" In July, a man who served as security chief for former President Alvaro Uribe turned himself in to U.S. agents in Colombia to face drug trafficking charges in the United States. Mauricio Santoyo Velascois accused of accepting bribes from a paramilitary group, as well as the Oficina de Envigado.

"(CNN) -- We tend to think of the 2008 financial crisis as the atom bomb that smashed the American economy, and from which we have yet to recover. But what if our economic woes started far earlier than that? The recession officially began in December 2007, and some scholars, including Jeremy Nalewaik of the Federal Reserve, argue that if we measure gross domestic product by looking at incomes rather than expenditures, it actually started in the last three months of 2006. That is, we started digging the hole even earlier than is commonly understood. And now a number of scholars are suggesting that our troubles really began in the early 2000s, yet they were masked by an unsustainable housing boom. The recovery has been extremely uneven, with college-educated workers faring better than non-college-educated workers. This has led a number of economic thinkers to suggest that the persistence of high unemployment flows in no small part from a structural dynamic. Just as the transition from an agricultural to an industrial economy created tremendous dislocation in the Depression era, and the transition from an industrial to a service-oriented economy devastated America's Rust Belt in the sharp recession of the early 1980s, one possibility is that we are living through another painful transition, only we don't have a good sense of what the United States will look like on the other side. This is the view embraced by thinkers on the left, like Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia University, and in the center, like Raghuram Rajan of the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, as well as many conservatives and libertarians who advocate structural reform. Though these thinkers acknowledge that weak consumer demand plays a role, they vary considerably in what they consider the appropriate formula for jump-starting growth and they are convinced that fixing the demand problem alone isn't enough. Others maintain that our current economic stagnation is almost entirely about weak consumer demand that flows from the damage the housing bust did to household balance sheets, and that some combination of fiscal and monetary stimulus should be our highest priority. This view is most commonly associated with liberals such as New York Times columnist and Princeton economist Paul Krugman. CNNMoney.com: Wall Street faces barrage of data . A related view, which attributes dismal growth to a monetary policy that is far too tight, has been championed by the libertarian Bentley University economist Scott Sumner and a growing number of right-leaning thinkers. These thinkers tend to maintain that the ""structuralists"" are missing the point. Even if there is a big economic transition is going on, its importance is swamped by the more straightforward shortfall in consumer demand. A number of economists, many of them based at the University of Chicago, have been devising new ways to test these theories to determine what has really happened to cause high unemployment. Last year, Atif Mian of the University of California, Berkeley; and Amir Sufi of the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business released a paper arguing that the central driver of the decline in employment levels between 2007 and 2009 -- the massive economic blow from which we have yet to recover -- was a drop in demand caused by shocks to household balance sheets. Mian and Sufi tested this proposition by comparing employment declines in high-leverage counties, in which households had higher ratios of debt to disposable income, and in low leverage counties, in which households had lower ratios. They found that high leverage counties saw a steeper drop in ""non-tradable employment"" than low leverage counties, which led them to conclude that consumer demand shocks were indeed key. The non-tradable part matters because employment in tradable industries such as manufacturing depends on the health of the national and global marketplace while non-tradable employment (think restaurant waiters or physical therapists) depends on the health of the local marketplace. Of the 6.2 million jobs lost between 2007 and 2009, Mian and Sufi attributed 4 million to this hit to consumer demand. Though Mian and Sufi don't make explicit policy recommendations, one implication of their findings is that the best way to restore economic growth might be to address household balance sheet weakness directly, whether through debt forgiveness or an increase in inflation. Debt forgiveness would allow households to reduce mortgage payments, thus giving them more to spend, and inflation would erode the value of accumulated debt, thus making it more manageable. Just this month, Kerwin Kofi Charles of the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy and Erik Hurst and Matthew Notowidigo, both of the Booth School, offered a somewhat different take. Rather than focus exclusively on the period since 2007, Charles, Hurst, and Notowidigo analyze shifts in the composition of employment from 2000 to 2007. Specifically, they focus on how declines in manufacturing employment interacted with housing booms in different cities across the United States. Essentially, the authors find that while a negative shock to manufacturing employment had a big negative impact on employment for non-college-educated men, a positive shock to housing prices more than made up for it. Until, that is, the housing bust wiped out these gains. And so Charles, Hurst, and Notowidigo conclude that in the absence of the housing boom, the unemployment crisis facing non-college-educated men would have arrived much sooner. In other words, the 37% rise in housing prices between 2000 and 2007 functioned as a kind of invisible stimulus that shielded non-college-educated men from most of the fallout from the collapse in manufacturing jobs, 3.5 million of which evaporated over that same period. By way of comparison, there are 12 million manufacturing jobs in the United States today. One irony of the housing boom is that it convinced millions of American men that there was no need to retrain for a new economic landscape, a decision that many might now regret. The views of Mian and Sufi and Charles, Hurst, and Notowidigo are not necessarily at odds. Charles, Hurst, and Notowidigo are very open to the possibility that household balance sheet weakness has played a significant role in the persistence of high unemployment. Yet there are interesting tensions between these views. By offering a compelling structural explanation for the steep employment decline among non-college-educated men in the wake of the housing bust, Charles, Hurst, and Notowidigo reinforce the view advanced by, among others, Booth's Raghuram Rajan. In his well-regarded book ""Fault Lines,"" Rajan argued that one of the reasons the federal government subsidized mortgages and pushed for low interest rates is that politicians saw it as a cheap and easy way to boost the economic prospects of low- and middle-income households in a deindustrializing economy. If Charles, Hurst, and Notowidigo are correct, tackling household balance sheet weakness might not be enough to address the economic challenges facing these men. Rather, men who were well-suited for either manufacturing or residential construction work will have to be retrained for jobs in very different fields. A darker possibility is that many of these men will drop out of the formal labor force entirely, and will find themselves living on the margins of society. This is the kernel of truth in the debate over outsourcing. Though the offshoring of production has greatly benefited the American economy in many important respects -- by lowering the cost of goods and services, by increasing the demand for skilled labor, and by facilitating innovation, among other things -- it has contributed to the deterioration of the labor market position of non-college-educated men. Automation has played a far larger role in declining manufacturing employment than offshoring, and indeed offshoring can be seen as nothing more than a transitional step as increasingly sophisticated machines start displacing less-skilled foreign labor. But it is offshoring that sparks the most anxiety in American workers. By documenting the scale of U.S. manufacturing's decline, Charles, Hurst, and Notowidigo have done a great deal to shed light on why. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Reihan Salam.","Reihan Salam: We think of the 2008 crash as the bomb that caused today's economic woes .
He says evidence is building that U.S. economy was troubled years before that .

"(CNN) -- There are two different races happening at the Golden Globes this year -- one for movies, which is neck-and-neck with the Academy Awards -- and one for television, which lags behind the Emmys. So while the Golden Globes can act in some ways as a salve for Oscar snubs and a predictor of Oscar wins, it doesn't have the quite same breathlessness when it comes to television, since the Emmys are so last year (OK, four months ago) and, unlike movies, TV shows can have a track record of previous Globes wins. Still, they provide a fun game of ""Who will win?"" and ""Who should win?"" To make your awards viewing (and betting?) more manageable, here are some of Entertainment's most educated guesses, thanks to input from the nominees themselves. Golden Globe movie nominees: Who will win vs. who should win . Best television series -- drama . ""Breaking Bad,"" ""Boardwalk Empire,"" ""Downton Abbey,"" ""Homeland"" and ""The Newsroom"" are all up against each other, like sweaty singles in a nightclub. ""Boardwalk"" showrunner Terence Winter, however, doesn't think his show can really compete with ""Walter White in the crazy department. But we might be up there, sure."" He noted that ""it's an amazing time for TV drama,"" and daunting to even think about the competition in that category. The showrunners for ""Homeland"" -- Alex Gansa and Howard Gordon -- were thrilled to be recognized in another category this year: those shows which have been parodied on ""The Simpsons."" ""We're officially in the popular culture!"" Gordon said with glee. That Emmy win doesn't hurt, either -- ""Homeland"" is a shoo-in; it can, will, and should win. Plus, it won last year. Best television series -- comedy or musical . The contenders are ""The Big Bang Theory,"" ""Episodes,"" ""Girls,"" ""Modern Family"" and ""Smash."" ""Modern Family"" also won the Golden Globe last year, but what about giving another show a chance, perhaps one that had its first season last year? ""Smash"" is the only real musical of the group, even though it's also a drama, which makes it an odd duck here, but ""Girls"" feels like a natural winner. ""It's smart, and it's funny, and I find the specificity of the dialogue really refreshing,"" said ""Portlandia"" co-creator Carrie Brownstein. ""I love how it delves into the awkward moments, awkward sex, without shying away from it and in an unrelenting way. I'm really rooting for 'Girls' and I think Lena Dunham is a genius."" You go, girl. Best mini-series or motion picture made for television . Based on the Emmys, you might well guess that ""Game Change"" has this category on lockdown. But it's up against ""The Girl,"" ""Hatfields & McCoys,"" ""The Hour"" and ""Political Animals."" OK, that's not really much competition against the juggernaut that is ""Game Change."" ""At a function for 'Recount,' I mentioned to someone, 'I would have loved to been in the room when they made the decision (to put Sarah Palin on the Republican ticket),"" director Jay Roach said. ""I'd been working on a spin doctors story for a long time, but then I thought, 'This is the story.' "" Even though ""Game Change"" is such a powerful tale that it's getting a follow-up, this category tends to favor mini-series over movies (""Downton Abbey"" won the previous year). If the Hollywood Foreign Press is so inclined, might we suggest the very deserving BBC program ""The Hour,"" which is oft-compared to ""Mad Men"" for its 1960s period setting, but is actually a drama about investigative journalists who get pulled into political and sexual scandals. Best performance by an actress in a television series -- drama . If ""Homeland"" can and should win, so should its star, Claire Danes. Her competition, however, includes Connie Britton for ""Nashville,"" Glenn Close for ""Damages,"" Michelle Dockery for ""Downton Abbey"" and Julianna Margulies for ""The Good Wife"" (who was also nominated last year). But outside of Close (who saw the final season of her show this year, always a cause for awards upsets), it's not even close. As Danes previously told CNN, ""I think people are rooting for (my character Carrie), and I'm so honored to be playing her."" Best performance by an actor in a television series -- drama . We'd say that what is good for the goose is good for the gander -- if Danes should win, so should her co-star Damian Lewis. But that didn't happen at the Globes last year, even though he was nominated. (He did win the Emmy, however). And the race might be tougher for Lewis this time, since his rivals include Steve Buscemi for ""Boardwalk Empire,"" Bryan Cranston for ""Breaking Bad"" (both of whom were also nominated last year), Jon Hamm for ""Mad Men"" and newbie Jeff Daniels for ""The Newsroom."" But since ""Homeland""'s focus shifted this season, from the pressure on Carrie to the pressure on Brody, Lewis might take home a trophy. Plus, he's a Brit and this is the Hollywood Foreign Press, who tend to reward those things. Best performance by an actor in a television series -- comedy or musical . The Hollywood Foreign Press Association awarded this honor to Matt LeBlanc for ""Episodes"" last year, but the show hasn't held up. This gives previous winner and perpetual nominee Alec Baldwin the favorite position -- especially given that this is the last season of ""30 Rock."" However, his competition includes Louis C.K. who is more identified with his program -- and not just because it's his name. He's the creator, writer, director, producer, editor and star of the show and won Emmys for acting, writing and directing ""Louie"" this last go-round. Baldwin may win, but Louis C.K. should win. Best performance by an actress in a television series -- comedy or musical . The nominees this year include returnees Zooey Deschanel (for ""New Girl""), Tina Fey (for ""30 Rock"") and Amy Poehler (for ""Parks and Recreation""), plus two stars of two new shows: Julia Louis-Dreyfus (for ""Veep"") and Lena Dunham (for ""Girls""). If Deschanel, Fey and Poehler couldn't beat winner Laura Dern last year, they don't provide much competition, even if two of them are Golden Globes co-hosts. Though sentimental value (the last season of ""30 Rock""!) might boost both Baldwin and Fey, she doesn't think she'll win; she casts her vote for BFF Poehler. We think it's more likely, however, that Louis-Dreyfus will take it, given her Emmy win and ""Veep"" creator Armando Iannucci's U.K. roots (again, foreign press decides this one). But the one we're rooting for is Dunham, who plays a character who feels more real and authentic than most of what's on television. Best performance by an actress in a mini-series or motion picture made for television . ""Game Change"" may or may not win, but Julianne Moore as Sarah Palin will, even if her competition is Nicole Kidman (""Hemingway & Gellhorn""), Jessica Lange (""American Horror Story: Asylum""), Sienna Miller (""The Girl"") and Sigourney Weaver (""Political Animals""). ""Julianne Moore put so much heart and soul in that,"" her director Ray Roach said. ""There's so much political masking that goes on, you need someone who is a fully engaged human being first and foremost, beyond a candidate, and I thought Julianne did an amazing job."" So did the Emmys. Best performance by an actor in a mini-series or motion picture made for television . Like Julianne Moore, Woody Harrelson will probably take this category. But also in the running are Emmy-winner Kevin Costner for ""Hatfield & McCoys,"" Benedict Cumberbatch for ""Sherlock,"" Toby Jones for ""The Girl"" and Clive Owen for ""Hemingway & Gellhorn."" ""Game Change"" is a little too much of an American story for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to sweep, so they might be willing to give this one to a more deserving Brit -- Cumberbatch. His modern-day Sherlock Holmes is enigmatic, charismatic and wholly singular. Plus, it's his year, what with also playing the mysterious villain in the new ""Star Trek"" movie and the dragon and the Necromancer in ""The Hobbit."" Best performance by an actor in a supporting role in a series, mini-series or motion picture made for television . After this past season of ""Homeland,"" is there any question who should win? Still, Mandy Patinkin has some worthy rivals, including Ed Harris for ""Game Change"" (and he just might win), Eric Stonestreet for ""Modern Family"" (an awards favorite for comedy, but unfortunately he's going against the drama guys), Danny Huston for ""Magic City"" and Max Greenfield for ""New Girl."" Patinkin plays his character Saul with such nuance, fans of the show are still guessing whether or not he's the mole in the CIA -- complicated by his rise in power at the end of last season. ""I have my own theory,"" Patinkin told CNN. ""As a matter of fact, I write my own theories underneath everything I say. And part of the fun for me is when I hit bingo, and get what the writers were doing."" Best performance by an actress in a supporting role in a series, mini-series or motion picture made for television . Can the Dowager Countess take home the Golden Globe now that Jessica Lange has been promoted from supporting to lead on ""American Horror Story: Asylum""? For Maggie Smith's sake, we would say yes. ""Downton Abbey"" deserves some love, and there's no better recipient this year, considering the actress is also up against Jennifer Lawrence for best actress for musical or comedy (and there's no chance there). Still, it's not in the bag, and Hayden Panettiere (""Nashville""), Archie Panjabi (""The Good Wife""), Sofia Vergara (""Modern Family"") and Sarah Paulson (who is nominated for ""Game Change"") are all in the running. We say Smith is the queen of zingers, and who better to liven up the Globes with a well-timed spike? We do hope she's interrupting something.","The Golden Globes are Sunday .
There's lots of speculation as to who will win in the TV categories .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Yair Lapid, the charismatic journalist-turned-politician who surprisingly vaulted to second place in Israel's national election, has long been a familiar face across the Jewish state. The 49-year-old leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party is a former journalist and talk show host, son of a prominent politician, and a one-time amateur boxer with a rep as one of Israel's sexiest men. Lapid segued his journalism into politics and emerged as an archetype -- a voice of the middle-class Israeli striving for success, but anxious about the high cost of living, a voice representing Israelis who've had it with the exemptions from mandatory military service for the ultra-Orthodox, a voice of everyday optimism. Opinion: Split vote offers options to Israeli leaders . He now has the clout to choose between leading the political opposition or becoming the key partner in a Netanyahu-led coalition. Or, the question has been raised, would Israeli President Shimon Peres decide to ask Lapid to form a government? Members of Yesh Atid range across the spectrum, Lapid said after the election in Tel Aviv. The bloc has attracted Jews from the West, the Middle East, and Africa, the religious and secular, centrists, leftists, and rightists, men and women. ""What unites all of them is that they said yes for hope and yes for mutual responsibility and yes to the fact that the truth is not being held in any side,"" Lapid said. Lapid emerged in an election that displayed Israel's political polarization, between staunch right-wingers focused on security and centrists focused on a better economy and society. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains the front runner to be prime minister, with exit polls reporting his rightist Likud-Beitenu party gaining 31 seats in the 120-seat Knesset. Naftali Bennett's far-right Jewish Home pulled in between 11 seats, according to exit polls numbers from the daily newspaper Haaretz. Shas, a religious party, gained 11 seats. But the center and the left showed strength. Lapid's party gained at least 19 seats, onetime powerhouse Labor, 15, former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni's Hatnua, 6, and leftwing Meretz, 6. 'There is a future' The Hebrew Yesh Atid means 'There is a future.' The party's platform is decidedly domestic: Reforming government, seeking affordable housing, improving a ""failing"" education system, and the biggest hot-button issue, putting an end to the exemption from mandatory military service for ultra-Orthodox Jews who have traditionally been legally allowed to avoid military service in order pursue religious study. There's much less from Lapid on how to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But in interviews, Lapid has proposed Israel should give up much of the West Bank -- while retaining control of Jersualem. The bio on his party's website details his career. He worked as a newspaper correspondent, hosted talk shows, published seven books, including children's books, thrillers and a memoir in the voice of his father. He wrote a TV drama, and acted in a film. He's a family man, married to a woman he met on reserve duty, and has three children. Barak: Israeli coalition difficult to predict . Yair Lapid is the son of the late politician Tommy Lapid, whose one-time anti-religious party Shinui battled the power and influence of the ultra-Orthodox. When Yair Lapid transitioned into Israeli politics, he didn't shy away from dealing with ultra-Orthodox military exemptions. ""We will fight for equality in national responsibilities with everyone serving and everyone working,"" he said. But he used diplomatic language and persuasion in an effort to forge partnerships and policies with religionists. That's a contrast to his father's combative stance toward the ultra-Orthodox. His party leadership reflects the championing of the diversity he espouses. They include the mayors of Herzliya and Dimona, a former Jerusalem police chief, Russians, Ethiopians, rabbis and a former personal aide to slain Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Voices from the center . One of the leaders is Rabbi Dov Lipman, a confidant of Lapid and an American immigrant to Israel. He represents the ultra-Orthodox, Yesh Atid's website says, Haredim who want to combine Torah study with national/Israel Defense Forces service and participation in the workforce. In an interview this month before the election, Lipman said he was drawn to the outreach to the religious community from Lapid whom he characterizes as ""very much a secular icon of sorts."" ""He was saying it was time to stop focusing on our own sectors and it was time for us to work together,"" Lipman said. ""That really spoke to me."" Lapid is optimistic, Lipman said, ""that Israeli society has reached a point where they are saying 'no more' to the way things have been handled."" ""One of our slogans is 'The future of Israel is in our hands.' With leadership there are two steps, the first is to give people the belief that something can happen, and then to execute it,"" Lipman said. ""I think Part 1 he's really done. It's a breath of fresh air. In Israel politics, you don't really hear people talking about vision and where we can be and setting our sights high. He's really doing that. I think he on a certain level has instilled that hope. I think he's optimistic because he's seen the response to his call for making this change and that we can actually get this done."" Netanyahu dips into centrists' playbook for Israel's new government . Yossi Klein Halevi, a noted Israeli author, wrote an essay Wednesday in Tablet, an online magazine about Jewish issues. The piece is entitled ""Why I voted for Yair Lapid."" ""As a centrist Israeli,"" he said, ""I have no other political home."" Netanyahu tried to make Likud more of a center-right movement, ""but the ideological right within the Likud revolted. Today's Likud appears more hospitable to the far rightist Moshe Feiglin than to centrists like Dan Meridor, denied a safe seat in the Likud primaries,"" Halevi wrote. In contrast, Lapid has an ""eclecticism"" that ""reflects his ability -- alone among today's leaders -- to define the Israeli center."" ""He is a secular Israeli who has shown increasing interest in Judaism. He supports a two-state solution and opposes settlement construction outside the large settlement blocs. Yet he launched his campaign from the West Bank city of Ariel, sending the message that settlers are part of Israel too. He opposes the wholesale draft exemption of ultra-Orthodox young men, but he advocates a gradualist approach and has an ultra-Orthodox rabbi on his Knesset list. He emerged as the voice of middle class disaffection, yet included in his list two Ethopians, representatives of one of the country's poorest constituencies."" Halevi says Lapid is ""frankly, unapologetically, in love with the state of Israel."" ""There is nothing complicated about Yair's Israeliness. He is not a hyphenated Israeli, whose loyalty to the state depends on its fulfillment of an ideological agenda. Yair conveys the impression of a man comfortable in all parts of Israel,"" Halevi wrote. CNN's Joe Sterling reported from Atlanta.

"Washington (CNN) -- After four years in which he has alternately helped -- and miffed -- the White House, Vice President Joe Biden told CNN that his role as the deal-closer is clearly his most comfortable yet. ""I have spent a lot of time in this town. And I have personal relationships with people I strongly disagree with, but there's trust. And so I'm a logical person, a logical person to, as they say or you guys say, close the deal,"" Biden told CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger in an exclusive pre-inaugural interview. Biden cut the last-minute deal last month with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell that averted going over the fiscal cliff -- after President Barack Obama's negotiations with House Speaker John Boehner failed. He was given the high-profile task of putting together the administration's sweeping gun control proposals and will play a major role in pushing them through Congress. He is quick to emphasize that he was not undercutting the president when he reached deals with congressional Republicans. ""I have his complete support for what I'm saying, because I know what he wants, No. 1,"" Biden said. ""It's the president, not me."" Sworn in again, Obama lingers for last look . Obama and the vice president ran against each other for the 2008 Democratic nomination, and Biden said that helped forge a relationship. ""So when we got into this deal, we didn't have what other administrations have had, where the vice president and the president have a different take on the major issues of the day. We're totally simpatico,"" Biden said. He told Borger that he never had any problem with any assignment he was given in the first term, when he was tasked with overseeing the $787 billion stimulus program, cutting several key fiscal deals with congressional Republicans once they took control of the House of Representatives in the mid-terms and leading the effort to end the U.S. military presence in Iraq. Biden makes second term official . In the second term, one of his major duties will be to help get congressional approval for the most far-reaching gun control legislation in decades. After dozens of meetings with more than 120 groups spanning the various issues related to gun violence, he led the inter-agency effort that came up with the specific proposals. Biden and Obama know they will have to mount a major public relations campaign to try to overcome the strength and opposition of the National Rifle Association. ""There's a growing consensus in this country, a growing consensus among even sportsmen and other groups, about everything from who should own a weapon ... and what information should be available,"" he told CNN, saying he believed it would be easier to pass this type of legislation in the wake of the elementary school shootings in Newtown, Connecticut. Biden, a major gun-control proponent who has gone up against the National Rifle Association for decades, was the major reason the 1994 assault weapons bill passed. A tale of two terms: Unfinished business and battles ahead . Asked if he thought the NRA is stoking fear against the president, he responded, ""Look, I think the NRA's reaction -- overreaction -- is a reflection of the vulnerability of their position."" Biden is also expected to be one of the key players in coming fiscal fights: automatic spending cuts set to take effect in a month, funding the government and the debt ceiling. House Republicans just signaled they would support a three month extension. The vice president said that is a hopeful sign that the GOP would not allow the country to default on its debts. ""The Republicans aren't going to do that. They've finally figured it out. All this bluster about you're going to renege on the debt,"" he said. ""They will not because there are more responsible people in that party than irresponsible. So it's not going to happen."" Biden said he hoped there is still a path forward to allow the White House and congressional leaders to reach agreement on a major deficit reduction deal -- one that has so far eluded them despite optimism in the past. Biden's recommendations on gun control to Obama . ""So we ought to be able to, in the next three months, finish out that grand bargain to get us to the point of ... where debt to GDP (gross domestic product) is about 3%,"" he said. ""Every economist, left, right and center, says that -- when that happens, the economy grows. I think we'll get there."" As the president and vice president have worked to achieve many of the administration's major goals, the two have had some disagreements -- Biden did not agree that the timing of the mission to kill Osama bin Laden was right, and the vice president got out in front of his boss when Biden voiced support for same-sex marriage on ""Meet the Press"" last May. ""We sometimes disagreed on tactics as to how to proceed to try to get what he wanted done, which I've agreed with, but we've never disagreed on policy. And even the so-called discussion about, you know, my saying I was comfortable with gay and lesbians and relationships, I knew his positions,"" Biden said. When Borger asked about those specific comments, he recounted how the president reacted. ""I walked into the office and he got up, smiled, gave me a big hug and he said, 'Now, I'll tell you what, man, that's one of the things I like about you, you say what's on your mind,' "" the vice president recounted. He recently told The New York Times it did cause ""a little apoplexy"" around the White House. ""It did, but not with him. Not with him."" It was with the president's staff. Some of Biden's candor has at times has not gone over well with White House officials. Obama's second-term priorities . Asked how he can tell when he may have done something the president doesn't like or makes him angry, Biden said that is ""easy."" ""We made a deal early on, when either one of us are dissatisfied we just flat tell the other person. And so one -- lunch once a week, you know, that's when we talk. And when he hasn't liked something I've done, he just flat tells me."" Borger asked: ""He says, 'Joe, you shouldn't have done that?' "" Biden responded ""He says, 'Joe, look ... I don't agree with the way you did that. You, you know, why did you do A, B, C or D?' Or he will say, or I will say, 'Hey, look, man, I don't like the way this is going' -- so there's complete openness."" Biden, who at times has been known more by the public for his gaffes than his policy work, has seen his approval ratings rise recently. He has hinted he may seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and told CNN any decision about his future is not imminent. He did attend Iowa's inaugural party in Washington this weekend and invited New Hampshire's governor to his official swearing-in Sunday. Those two states vote first in presidential nominating contests in three years. ""There's a whole lot of reasons why I wouldn't run. I haven't made that decision. And I don't have to make that decision for a while. In the meantime, there's one thing I know I have to do, no matter what I do. I have to help this president move this country to the next stage."" Asked whether he was ready to run against Hillary Clinton, who many Democrats expect to be a candidate in 2016, he responded: ""I haven't made that judgment. And Hillary hasn't made that judgment. But I can tell you what -- everything that should be done over the next two years that I should be part of would have to be done whether I run or I don't run. ""If this administration is successful, whoever is running as a Democrat is better positioned to win. If we're not successful, whoever runs as the nominee is going to be less likely to win.""

"(CNN) -- U.S. politicians must not sacrifice economic growth for the sake of political differences, according to Dutch foreign minister Frans Timmermans. The world's largest economy is facing $85 billion in spending cuts that will begin to take effect on Friday. Timmermans told CNN's Nina Dos Santos that Europe is eager to see growth in the U.S. and says it would be a ""tragedy"" if tribal politics hinders progress on economic expansion. He added: ""I do hope that our colleagues in Congress will be responsible enough to solve that problem."" The cuts are a product of the sequester, a series of automatic, across-the-board cuts to government agencies, totaling $1.2 trillion over 10 years. These would be split 50-50 between defense and domestic discretionary spending. Timmermans also commented on the outlook for the eurozone. Speaking in the wake of the Italian elections on Monday, the Dutch minister said he is ""fairly confident"" that Italy will find a solution to its political problems as it has done in the past. The elections in Italy -- the eurozone's third-largest economy -- ended in political deadlock this week following a three-way battle between center-left leader Pier Luigi Bersani, former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and comedian Beppe Grillo. Timmermans believes political stability is needed in the 17-nation eurozone to implement genuine reform following a debt crisis that has plagued the region for over three years. He says the euro area will gradually move toward more fiscal cohesion while the difference with the 10 European Union nations outside the single currency area should remain ""as small as possible."" The UK in particular is trying to renegotiate its relationship with the 27-nation trade bloc and has promised a referendum on EU membership by 2017. He added: ""I think we already have a two or multi-tier Europe in many domains and I think Europe is so diverse that we need different speeds on different subjects. I'm not afraid of that.""

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN)  -- The top prosecutor of the International Criminal Court arrived in Kenya on Saturday to investigate post-election violence that left more than 1,000 people dead more than two years ago. Hundreds of thousands were also displaced after the disputed December 2007 election sparked ethnic violence nationwide. Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said his five-day trip will include visits with victims. He'll also tour some of the areas hardest hit by the violence, including Rift Valley province and the sprawling Kibera slum in Nairobi. Ocampo said he'll also meet top government officials and those who believe they were unfairly identified as suspects on a list of 20 people handed to him. The names of the suspects have not been identified publicly. Chaos erupted after incumbent President Mwai Kibaki was declared the winner in the election. Opposition challenger Raila Odinga decried the results, prompting violence between their supporters. The election and its aftermath tainted the country's image as an oasis of stability in the region. Former United Nations chief Kofi Annan and other world leaders intervened, and the two contenders signed a power-sharing agreement. Kibaki is the president while Odinga is the prime minister. Annan has said proceedings against culprits should occur before campaigning starts for the next election in 2012.","More than 1,000 killed, hundreds of thousands displaced after 2007 election .

"(CNN) -- In a first for the prestigious organization, a Nobel Prize will go to a man who died just days before being named a winner. Ralph Steinman, a biologist with Rockefeller University, was named a winner Monday of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He would have won half the prize of approximately $1.5 million; the other half will be shared by scientists Bruce A. Beutler and Jules A. Hoffmann. Steinman died of pancreatic cancer Friday at the age of 68, after having extended his life using a kind of therapy he designed, his university said in a statement Monday. The Nobel committee was unaware of his death. Had they known, their own rules would have precluded him being selected as a winner. The decision was made Monday, just before the announcement, Nobel officials said. ""The events that have occurred are unique and, to the best of our knowledge, are unprecedented in the history of the Nobel Prize,"" the Nobel Assembly said in a statement, announcing that Steinman will remain a Nobel laureate. Making the decision meant circumventing one of the Nobel rules. The Nobel Prize website states that since 1974, rules have stipulated that a prize ""cannot be awarded posthumously, unless death has occurred after the announcement."" In its statement Monday, the Nobel Assembly said it interpreted ""the purpose of the rule"" as making sure no one is ""deliberately"" awarded the prize posthumously. Because the committee did not know of Steinman's death, the decision ""was made in good faith,"" the assembly said. The Nobel committee also expressed ""deep sadness and regret"" at the news. Speaking to CNN, Goran Hansson, secretary-general of the Nobel assembly overseeing the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, said the fact that Steinman didn't know he would win ""adds to the sadness."" Hansson said that after the committee chose the winners Monday, he tried to call Steinman to inform him of the good news. Rockefeller University said Steinman ""discovered the immune system's sentinel dendritic cells and demonstrated that science can fruitfully harness the power of these cells and other components of the immune system to curb infections and other communicable diseases."" ""He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer four years ago, and his life was extended using a dendritic cell-based immunotherapy of his own design,"" the university said in a statement. The Nobel committee noted Steinman's ""discovery of the dendritic cell and its role in adaptive immunity."" Bruce A. Beutler and Jules A. Hoffmann won ""for their discoveries concerning the activation of innate immunity."" In 1996, William Vickrey died days after the announcement that he had won the Nobel Prize in economics. Before 1974, two people received Nobel Prizes posthumously -- Dag Hammarskjold won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1961, and Erik Axel Karlfeldt won for literature in 1931. Monday's announcement about the winners kicked off a week of awards that will also honor achievements in physics, chemistry, literature, peace and economics. The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute said Beutler, Hoffmann and Steinman have ""revolutionized our understanding of the immune system by discovering key principles for its activation."" ""Bruce Beutler and Jules Hoffmann discovered receptor proteins that can recognize such microorganisms and activate innate immunity, the first step in the body's immune response,"" the committee said in a written statement. ""Ralph Steinman discovered the dendritic cells of the immune system and their unique capacity to activate and regulate adaptive immunity, the later stage of the immune response during which microorganisms are cleared from the body."" The Nobel laureates' discoveries and work have opened up new opportunities for the development of prevention and therapy against infections, cancer and inflammatory diseases, the committee said. The prize in medicine, worth 10 million Swedish kronor (about $1.5 million), went last year to Robert G. Edwards, ""the father of the test tube baby."" Since the first birth from in vitro fertilization in 1978, Edwards' work has led to the birth of about 4 million babies, the awards committee said in praising his work. On Tuesday, the committee will announce its award for achievement in physics. The next day, the winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry will be announced. The committee will announce the most anticipated of the annual honors -- the Nobel Peace Prize -- on Friday. On October 10, the committee will announce its award for the prize for economics. Since 1901, the committee has handed out the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 101 times. The youngest recipient was Frederick G. Banting, who won in 1923 at the age of 32. The oldest medicine laureate was Peyton Rous, who was 87 years old when he was awarded the prize in 1966.","NEW: Ralph Steinman remains the Nobel laureate, the committee says .

"New York (CNN) -- An unlicensed counselor in Brooklyn's ultra-Orthodox Jewish community was sentenced Tuesday to spend the rest of his life in prison after repeatedly sexually abusing a young girl in his care. Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice John Ingram handed Nechemya Weberman a 103-year-sentence without the prospect of parole. Weberman, 54, was found guilty in December on 59 counts, including sexual conduct against a girl he was advising over the course of three years. ""The abuse of a child cannot be swept under the rug or dealt with by insular groups believing only they know what is best for their community,"" District Attorney Charles Hynes said in a statement. The abuse began in 2007, when the girl's parents hired Weberman to help their then-12-year-old daughter. It continued -- mostly in his office -- until 2010, the district attorney's office said. ""I suffered great psychological damage and fell into severe depression,"" said the victim, whom CNN is not naming because she is a minor. The case brought scrutiny on the Satmar Hasidic community, many of whom live in the insular Orthodox Jewish neighborhood of South Williamsburg, Brooklyn. ""We honestly and truly believe that this was a setup,"" said defense attorney George Farkas after sentencing. ""He knows that his future lies in the appellate process."" The case came to light when four men were arrested and accused of trying to bribe the victim and her boyfriend to get them to drop the case against Weberman, a spokesman for the district attorney said.

"(CNN) -- Two international bridges between Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, and Laredo, Texas, were closed Wednesday because of rising water on the Rio Grande, Laredo officials said. Laredo's International Bridge I is one of four that connect the two cities, but because it has the lowest elevation it was closed, said Laredo spokeswoman Xochitl Mora Garcia. Officials are worried that the high water may damage the bridge and are removing steel canopy shades authorities believe add weight and stress to the span, the spokeswoman told CNN. Officials expect the bridge to be closed for at least three days, Mora Garcia said. The Rio Grande, which usually has a depth of 6 to 10 feet at Laredo, is expected to crest Thursday at nearly 39 feet, the spokeswoman said. A second crossing, the Colombia Bridge, was closed because the water is cresting there at a higher level, Mora Garcia said. The bridge will be closed until further notice. It will take about a day to remove the canopies at International Bridge I and another day to reinstall them after the high waters subside, Mora Garcia said. About 10,000 to 12,000 pedestrians and 12,000 to 14,000 noncommercial vehicles cross International Bridge I each day, Mora Garcia said. Laredo has a population of about 250,000, but that typically swells to 350,000 to 400,000 as Mexicans come to the city to shop, visit family or engage in recreational activities, the spokeswoman said. The city is the nation's No. 1 inland port, Mora Garcia said. International Bridge II and the World Trade Bridge will remain open. Laredo owns and operates the four bridges, Mora Garcia said. ""Pedestrians who have no other alternative to reach Nuevo Laredo are encouraged to return immediately or make arrangements to travel by vehicle by Bridge II,"" the city said in a news release. ""Bridge II will NOT accept pedestrians to return to Nuevo Laredo. Colombia Bridge and World Trade Bridge can accept pedestrians."" In addition, buses from Nuevo Laredo will be transporting would-be pedestrians back and forth over Bridge II over the vehicle-only bridge. The arrangement was made between U.S. and Mexican officials and will remain in effect for the duration of the emergency situation, Mora Garcia said. Laredo was planning to open its emergency operation center Wednesday afternoon. Residents in the 100-year floodplain will be notified to evacuate if necessary, officials said. The Laredo Civic Center can be converted into a shelter, the city said. On Wednesday, Texas Gov. Rick Perry announced that he was sending vehicles, guardsmen, and rescue divers to the Laredo area. ""As South Texas continues to feel the effects of Hurricane Alex, we are closely monitoring a storm system that is expected to bring more heavy rains to the area and increase flooding along the Rio Grande,"" Perry said. Water service in Laredo will not be affected, but residents in Nuevo Laredo may have water service at 50 percent of the city's operating capacity, Laredo officials said. Communities throughout northeastern Mexico have been flooded as a result of heavy rains spawned by Hurricane Alex nearly two weeks ago. In the city of Reynosa in Tamaulipas state, on the border with Texas, 23,000 people were in danger Wednesday because of flooding by the Rio Bravo, the government-run Notimex news agency said. Alex stormed onshore as a Category 2 Hurricane on June 30, causing at least six deaths in Nuevo Leon state.","International Bridge I and Colombia Bridge connect U.S., Mexican cities .

"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- A Kuwaiti court sentenced three former members of parliament to three years in prison -- with hard labor -- on charges of insulting the nation's ruler, a human rights group said Tuesday. Falah Al-Sawagh, Bader Al-Dahoum and Khalid Al-Tahou are currently out on bail. They will appeal the decision, the Kuwait Society for Human Rights said. More than 300 people are currently detained in Kuwait on charges of insulting the emir, which is a crime under the national security law, said Mohammed Al-Humaidi, director of the human rights group. Some have faced prison time for what they said on Twitter. ""We call on the judiciary and the government to create a special law for electronic crimes like in other countries,"" Al-Humaidi said. ""Someone sending a text on a mobile or tweeting or commenting on social media should not be tried or convicted in a court of national security."" On Sunday, a Kuwaiti court sentenced another man, Mohammed Al-Ajmi, to five years of imprisonment for insulting the emir -- the maximum sentence permissible by law. Al-Humaidi said that sentence will also be appealed. The human rights group director said he did not know the exact nature of Al-Ajmi's tweet or why his sentence was longer than others. Kuwait's Ministry of Information said anyone accused of a crime gets ""a fair trial with a comprehensive legal defense and open appeals process."" ""Kuwait has a long-standing proud tradition of open debate and free speech with free, transparent and inclusive elections and the most robust parliament in the region,"" the ministry said in a statement Tuesday. ""We are a country led by the rule of law and our constitution holds our Emir to be inviolable. If our citizens wish to amend the constitution there is a straightforward legal way to do this, but we will not selectively enforce our laws."" Al-Ajmi is the third Kuwaiti to be sentenced this year for insulting Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah on Twitter. In January, Rashed Al-Enezi and Ayad Al-Hirbi were each sentenced to two years. Al-Humaidi said Al-Enezi's tweet implied an opposition member of parliament would do a better job ruling the country than the royal family. Al-Hirbi's tweet quoted a line by a dissident poet interpreted as insulting the emir. ""We call on the Kuwaiti government to abide by international agreements it has signed respecting human rights,"" Al-Humaidi said.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Amory Lovins is an environmentalist and the chairman and chief scientist of the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI). Amory Lovins founded the Rocky Mountain Institute in 1982 to promote energy efficiency. Lovins, who participated in Principal Voices in 2006, has advocated the ""soft energy path,"" which promotes efficiency and renewable energy. He has also propagated concepts based on energy conservation, efficiency as well as the generation of energy at or near the site where it is actually used. The author of 29 books, who has also advised 19 heads of state, Lovins talks about the current state of renewable energy. CNN: Do you think the climate change debate puts too much emphasis on alternative energy and not enough on energy efficiency? Amory Lovins: Yes. They're both important and synergistic, but efficiency is generally larger, cheaper, and faster. CNN: You've said that energy efficiency isn't costly, it's actually profitable for businesses -- why don't businesses focus more on this area? AL: Smart businesses are raising their energy efficiency by about five to 15 percent per year. Inattentive businesses -- distracted by other matters, or forgetting that saved overhead, even if it's a small fraction of total costs, drops straight to the bottom line, or lacking the leadership and attention to turn the many implementation barriers into business opportunities -- suffer high costs, increased risks, and lost competitive advantage. CNN: What are the most promising energy-saving technologies? AL: There's no short list of technologies; energy efficiency can be greatly increased in essentially every use and sector, including uncompromised but safer cars, trucks, and planes, with three times the current efficiency; buildings saving 80 to 90 percent of their energy and costing less to build; and often several-fold more efficient factories. Overall, the U.S. could save half its oil and gas and three-fourths of its electricity at a cost equivalent to about an eighth of their price. RMI's latest $30 billion worth of efficiency redesigns in 29 sectors have consistently found about 30 to 60 percent savings on retrofit, with two to three year paybacks, and about 40 to 90 percent savings in new facilities, with nearly always lower capital cost. Moreover, energy-saving technologies keep improving faster than they're applied, so efficiency is an ever larger and cheaper resource. The big surprise is that integrative design -- not a technology, but a way of combining technologies -- can often make very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings. For more on how to achieve this, read my Stanford Engineering School lecture notes. CNN: Why do you oppose nuclear power? AL: New nuclear plants are so extraordinarily costly that they would save about two to 11 times less carbon dioxide emission per dollar, about 20 to 40 times slower than investing the same money in efficient use of electricity or in ""micropower"" (co-generation and distributed renewables). These competitors already provide the majority of the world's new electrical services because they cost less and have lower financial risk than central thermal power stations do. Indeed, micropower generates more electricity than nuclear power does, and has lately been adding 30 to 41 times more capacity per year. The claimed 'nuclear revival' is not actually happening because, despite new U.S. subsidies rivaling or exceeding new nuclear plants' total cost, no private investors have been willing to finance them anywhere in the world; they're bought only by governments using public funds. Nuclear power has other serious problems -- most importantly, facilitating and cloaking the spread of nuclear bombs -- but since it's unbuildable in a free market, it fails before one reaches those issues. CNN: What can we do as individuals in our everyday lives to waste less energy? AL: Turn off stuff we're not using. Weatherize our homes. Combine trips, bike, walk, carpool, use public transit. Get the most efficient energy-using devices --vehicles, appliances, lights -- we can find. Become informed. Organize efficiency improvements in your workplace and community. Set a good example. Spread the word. Vote mindfully with your ballot, actions, and dollars.","Amory Lovins says smart businesses are becoming more energy efficient .

"(CNN) -- Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy will consider returning to politics to save his floundering center-right party, not because he wants to but because of patriotic ""duty,"" according to an article to be published Thursday in a right-leaning magazine. In an eight-page special called ""In the head of Nicolas Sarkozy,"" the former president discusses his political future in public for the first time. He is quoted as saying in Valeurs Actuelles magazine that he has no desire to return to politics, a world that ""bores him to death,"" and balks at the task of ""picking up France in the state where the Socialist Party will leave it."" But, Sarkozy said, ""there will be unfortunately a moment when the question will no longer be: 'Do you want to?' but 'Do you have a choice?'"" ""In this case, I cannot continue to say: 'I am happy, I take my daughter to school and I give conferences all around the world.' In this case, effectively, I will be obliged to come back. Not by desire. By duty. Only because it is for France."" According to a French Institute of Public Opinion poll released Wednesday, 56% of the supporters of his party -- the Union for a Popular Movement, known as UMP -- prefer Sarkozy as their candidate for the 2017 presidential election. In the article, Sarkozy criticizes President Francois Hollande, saying the Socialist Party leader ""has smashed everything that I managed to build with (German Chancellor) Angela Merkel. Not because he does not get along with her but because his politics are completely opposed to that of Germany."" On the subject of Mali, Sarkozy questioned the government's purpose: ""What are we doing over there? Apart from supporting coup-makers and attempting to control a country that is three times the size of France with 4,000 men?"" Since being defeated by Hollande last May -- and vowing never to return to politics -- Sarkozy has kept a low profile, working at his law firm in central Paris. But rumors of a comeback have intensified since the UMP's confused attempt to elect a successor last November, in which both candidates Francois Fillon and Jean-Francois Cope claimed victory amid intraparty squabbling and allegations of vote-rigging. After a two-day gridlock, Cope was declared the winner.

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel and his Red Bull team have left their Formula One rivals trailing in their wake during a three-year domination of the sport. But ahead of the 2013 season getting underway in Australia later this month, it is the triple world champion and his all-conquering team which has some catching up to do after a preseason which has not gone entirely to plan. Red Bull, and every other team, was left in Mercedes' rear-view mirrors at the final preseason test in Barcelona last weekend, with Vettel failing to top the charts at any of the offseason practice. Vettel insists there is still time for Red Bull to turn it around ahead of 2013's curtain raiser on March 17, when he will begin his bid to become only the third driver to win four consecutive championships. ""I would have loved to work more on the set-up, but I don't think that this is only me. I think everybody struggled in that area,"" the 25-year-old told Formula One's official website. ""We cannot be satisfied with the state of affairs right now ... there is still time before Melbourne to make some significant changes."" Vettel has been left frustrated by the tires introduced by the sport's official supplier Pirelli, which are softer than in 2012. Pirelli claim the new tires will speed up races and promote overtaking. ""It is extremely difficult to pinpoint any exact area we are not satisfied with because the tires are not consistent enough,"" continued Vettel. ""We need to have a good look at the data between now and Melbourne to have a better understanding of what to expect in Australia and the first few races of the season. In my opinion, lap times didn't matter all through the winter tests."" Regardless of preseason statistics, Vettel will be the man every driver on the grid will be targeting when the lights go out at Melbourne's Albert Park. ""I would say that we never had a winter that was less conclusive than this one: the tires last more or less, depending on how much temperature you are able to create,"" added Vettel. ""So I think it is impossible for all of us to read the pace of the cars and to make out any favorites."" Vettel will now head back to the team's British base in Milton Keynes before taking some time out ahead of the start of the campaign. ""Immediately into the simulator!"" said Vettel when asked what was next on his agenda. ""To continue where we left business on Sunday. ""We will then sit down and filter and interpret all the data that we have collected over the testing period to see what we can read out of it. ""Finally, before heading to Melbourne I will allow myself some final quiet days before the season starts with all its force."" Vettel made a slow start to the 2012 as there were eight different winners in the first eight races, but a run of four straight victories in the autumn set him on the way to his title triple, while Red Bull retained the constructors' title.","Sebastian Vettel not satisfied with Red Bull's preseason testing .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Separate blasts rocked three schools in Pakistan's troubled northwest early Friday morning, authorities said. One of the explosions at a school on the outskirts of Peshawar destroyed a wall, said Sahibzada Anis, Peshawar's administrative chief. No injuries were reported. Two other bombs were set up outside a school in the Khyber Agency of Pakistan's semiautonomous tribal areas, according to Azam Jan, a senior local administration official. One blew up and damaged a wall while the other was defused by local officials. A third school was hit in the same area, and the attack destroyed the wall of the compound but not the buildings, Jan said. Peshawar, the capital of the Northwest Frontier Province, is at the core of Pakistan's war on terror. The military has launched multiple offensives targeting homegrown militants, sparking a retaliation. Since October, the city has been the target of a series of attacks launched by militants to revenge a major Army offensive to root out the Taliban. A truck bomb in a popular market killed over 100 people in October and government and security forces have suffered regular attacks. Journalist Umar Aziz Khan contributed to this report.","Three schools in Pakistan's troubled northwest targeted by bomb blasts .

"(CNN) -- Ian Livingstone may not be the father of Lara Croft, but maybe at 63 he can be labeled the grandfather of Lara, the Tomb Raider. On the eve of the reboot of the franchise, with a younger and more realistic Lara, the life president of Eidos told me about that snowy night in March of 1995 when he reluctantly decided to travel to Derby England via car from Birmingham. He is forever grateful that he did. Livingstone was being shown around the offices of Core Design as he was doing due diligence ahead of a possible takeover by Eidos. ""In the very last room,"" Ian recalled, ""I think you could say it was love at first sight. There was this amazing character, on screen. It was the very first character with 3-D model, in a 3-D that was a female character."" For a generation, video games had been 2-D worlds with the action moving across the screen. ""Here is one with the character moving into the screen. And there she was, Lara Croft. And we had to have her. It was quite radical. Up to then, games were played mainly by teenage boys and the games were made were also men, so they tended to make male heroes."" Eidos bought Core Design and in 1996 Lara Croft, with her short trousers and large bust, hit computer screens. The game became huge. Since then, 30 million copies of Tomb Raider have been sold, before the launch of the new Tomb Raider Monday. But before you think Livingstone lucked into finding Lara Croft quietly being designed by Toby Gard at Core Design, this was 20 years in the making. Livingstone and his school friend Steve Jackson enjoyed playing board games, especially role-playing games. They started to write role-playing books and eventually discovered the American game Dungeons and Dragons. They got the exclusive European distribution rights to the board game on the back of ordering just six copies of D&D, according to Livingstone, and the set about trying to sell the games to stores. It wasn't easy. ""We had to live in a van for three months as we tried to get people to understand this strange role-playing game,"" Livingstone told me. However, he added, ""we never shied away from the challenge. We ended up opening our own shops because other people were reluctant to stock the games."" That string of stores, known as Games Workshop, set them on their way. And board games to video games was a natural progression. Now, with a CBE in the pocket and the honor title of Life President for Eidos -- a brand name now owned by Square Enix -- Livingstone is more of a advocate for the British video games and film graphics business. The UK was once in the top three in terms of games and graphics business, but has slipped to six. Livingstone says he knows why. British schools. ""The curriculum was simply teaching children how to use technology, not how to make technology,"" Livingstone told me. ""So it was making digital users, not digital makers."" Livingstone and Alex Hope, of Double Negative, were asked to make recommendations to the government to transform the school curriculum to teach people how to program, and not just use, video games. As Livingstone likes to point out, the UK games and graphics business is bigger than the film industry. And the industry supplies the film industry but also the military, among other customers. As for the new Tomb Raider, the reset is a chance to introduce Lara Croft to a new audience and make her a more realistic role model. ""Back in the 90s, it was more of a sort of cartoon character,"" Livingstone said. ""And now it's a realistic character. And realism goes to looks, behavior, and everything about the woman is real."" That includes Lara being younger and with a smaller bust size. ""In past Tomb Raiders, the combat had not been as real as it might have been. So, the decision was made to give it that gritty realism. And she was no longer that armor-plated Teflon-coated hero. Here was this character that you played as Lara, who could sustain damage."" But not be raped, Livingstone told me, recalling a misstep by an employee who said last year that one scene could be seen as the prelude to a sexual assault. ""There was no rape implication. There was a threat which she survived by throwing off her adversary."" The player has the tools to overcome the man and kill him within seconds, Livingstone said. With the reboot now out, it can't be long before we read of a new Lara Croft film with a new, younger, actress to set the mark for a new franchise. Then, more games must be on the cards. Lara lives on.","Thirty million copies of Tomb Raider had been sold before the launch of the new Tomb Raider on March 4 .

"(CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI's decision to resign caught a lot of Vatican watchers, apparently even some in his inner circle, off-guard. They should not have been so surprised. Canon law includes a provision for a papal resignation. But traditionally, popes continue their reigns until their natural deaths, much as a father can never ""resign"" from his place in a family. Before he was pope, as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, Benedict watched an increasingly frail Pope John Paul II struggle to shoulder his many responsibilities and respond, in his final years, to the scandal of the clerical sexual abuse crisis in the United States and Europe. Another reason it is not a shock: In Peter Seewald's ""Light of the World,"" a book-length interview with Benedict, the pope was unambiguous about his openness to the idea of papal resignation. Too tired to go on, Pope Benedict resigns . Yes, a pope could resign, Benedict said. ""If a pope clearly realizes that he is no longer physically, psychologically and spiritually capable of handling the duties of his office, then he has a right and, under some circumstances, also an obligation to resign."" And by some accounts, Benedict made three pilgrimages to the tomb of Pope Celestine V, who resigned from the papacy in 1294. So what comes next? Presuming that this pope's resignation follows the same protocol as the death of a pope, all major decisions and pronouncements will be on hold after Benedict's reign ends February 28. The See of Peter will be vacant -- officially ""Sede Vacante."" During the vacancy, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Holy See's camerlengo, Italian for chamberlain, takes charge with the help of three cardinal assistants. To prevent forgery, Bertone will break the pope's fisherman's ring by hitting it with a small hammer, a tradition that was started when the ring was used to seal documents. Benedict's apartment will be sealed to prevent any hijinks with official documents. Opinion: Why pope will be remembered for generations . Bertone will organize a conclave of 118 cardinals, who must meet in Rome within 20 days of the end of Benedict's reign to deliberate on a successor. White smoke rising from the Sistine Chapel's chimney will indicate a selection. Guessing who that selection might be, one of the church's favorite spectator sports, has already begun among papal watchers worldwide. Among the ""papabile,"" or possible contenders, are Cardinal Angelo Scola, archbishop of Milan, which would return the job to an Italian; Cardinal Marc Ouellet, former archbishop of Quebec; Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana, president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, which would be a nod to the African church's growing numbers and influence; and Joao Braz de Aviz of Brazil, indicating a liberating take on the church in the future. The Pope's resignation, explained . How about Cardinals Donald Wuerl or Timothy Dolan from the United States? They are outside contenders. The rest of the world thinks Americans are super-powered enough already. Whoever is chosen will face the many challenges that Pope Benedict has no doubt wisely decided he no longer has the stamina to address, including: . • The growing secularization and antipathy of the West. • Violence and intolerance visited on Christians in Islamic nations like Pakistan, Egypt and Syria. • The evaporating Christian presence in the Holy Land, Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East. • More brutal revelations of clerical sexual abuse in Africa and Latin America, which have yet to adequately confront the problem. • The ongoing priest shortage. • Plummeting church attendance. • Growing calls for optional celibacy. • Persisting demands for women's ordination and more. Is there somebody out there who really wants this job? Surprising standards for next Catholic leader . Perhaps now, with confidence that a new precedent has been set and an actual well-deserved retirement would not be completely out of the question, someone will be courageous or foolhardy enough to step forward. And in an oddity of church tradition, that person need not be a cleric, only a baptized male. So if you are, feel free to submit your application to the College of Cardinals. Meanwhile, let us pray whoever is the next pope is also equipped with compassion, mercy and vision. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kevin Clarke.","Kevin Clarke: Pope Benedict XVI's decision to resign caught papal watchers off-guard .

"(OPRAH.com) -- When the first book of the ""Twilight"" series was released in October 2005, no one could have guessed the phenomenon it would become. Four years later, 70 million copies have been sold worldwide. The books have spent 143 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list, and the first movie in ""The Twilight Saga"" grossed $380 million at the box office. The story, a love triangle between a vampire, a human and a werewolf, has ignited an international frenzy, and the woman behind it all is 35-year-old author Stephenie Meyer. Once a stay-at-home mom, Stephenie says the idea for ""Twilight"" came to her in a dream. ""It was two people in kind of a little circular meadow with really bright sunlight, and one of them was a beautiful, sparkly boy and one was just a girl who was human and normal, and they were having this conversation. The boy was a vampire, which is so bizarre that I'd be dreaming about vampires, and he was trying to explain to her how much he cared about her and yet at the same time how much he wanted to kill her,"" Stephenie says. ""It really captured my imagination."" That dream became Chapter 13 of ""Twilight."" Oprah.com: Get your Twilight"" primer . Before the night of the dream, Stephenie says she had lost herself a little in the work of motherhood. ""I was really burned out. I really had gotten into that zombie mom way of doing things where I wasn't Stephenie anymore,"" she says. ""[Writing ""Twilight] was a release. That was the dam bursting. I'd been bottling up who I was for so long, I needed an expression."" Though she'd been married for 15 years, Stephenie says she didn't tell her husband at first about her new passion. ""My husband thought I'd gone crazy. I'd barely spoken to him because I had all these things going on in my head, and I wasn't telling him about this weird vampire obsession because I knew he'd freak out and think I'd lost my mind,"" she says. At first, Stephenie was documenting her dream only to make sure she would remember it, she says. ""The dream was just something I was so interested in, and it was so different from what my everyday was at the time,"" she says. ""I just wanted to remember it so badly. That's why I started writing it down -- not because I thought this would be a great story for a novel."" Oprah.com: Read an excerpt from ""Twilight"" Though Stephenie had been an avid reader all her life, she says she was never a writer before ""Twilight."" ""It seems kind of presumptuous to me [to think] anyone else would want to read the things that are in my head,"" she says. ""I didn't think of it [as a book]. I did the dream. And then I wanted to see what would happen with them. It was just me spending time with this fantasy world, and then when it was finished it was like, 'This is long enough to be a book!'"" Before ""Twilight,"" Stephenie says she read every type of book except for horror. ""That was the genre I just knew I was too chicken for,"" she says. ""I read a little bit of everything. ... When I was 8, I was reading ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"" and all that, not knowing it wasn't my reading level."" Oprah.com: Gift ideas for every reader on your list . Now that ""Twilight"" is a huge success, it's hard to imagine any literary agent rejecting it. But Stephenie says she'd submitted it to plenty of people before she was signed. ""I got nine rejections, five no answers and then one 'I'd like to read more,'"" she says. Stephenie says it was her sister who really pushed her to keep submitting it to more agents. ""She was the only one in the world who knew what I was doing,"" she says. These days, the ""Twilight""series is more than just a literary hit. The first two movies have also created a stir and catapulted three young stars into the limelight. British actor Robert Pattinson, who plays the lead vampire Edward Cullen, is now an international heartthrob. ""I knew that the problem was going to be Edward, because he's the perfect vampire,"" Stephenie says. ""How do you cast that from your pool of human actors?"" When producers found Robert, Stephenie says it was a perfect fit. ""He's got something about him. He doesn't look like everybody else. There's something unusual,"" she says. ""There are moments where he looks exactly like he did in my head."" Stephenie says casting Bella, the book's protagonist, was a bit easier. ""There's plenty of people who look like the girl next door,"" she says. ""We were really lucky [to cast] Kirsten Stewart, who is a phenomenal actress. I didn't know if we were going to get that caliber."" Though Twi-hards, as fans are called, know most everything about the series, Stephenie says there is one secret she's never revealed before. ""There was a different ending to ""New Moon"" originally,"" she says. ""It was a much quieter book. It was very much all in Bella's head."" Oprah.com: Are you a Twi-hard? Take the quiz! Stephenie says fans have her mother to thank for ""New Moon's"" current dramatic ending. ""My mom's like: 'You know, Stephenie, maybe a little more action at the end would be a good idea. Maybe you need that,'"" Stephenie says. ""And she was right, as usual."" Find out more about ""New Moon"" Her mother's suggestion prompted Stephenie to introduce the Volturi, an all-powerful coven of vampires living in Italy, sooner than she'd planned.

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- A plane crashed Tuesday in western Kenya, killing all four people on board, including a Cabinet minister and an assistant minister, President Mwai Kibaki said. The two senior government figures were members of Raila Odinga's party. ""The wreckage has been found and there are no survivors,"" Kibaki said, according to the government Web site. Kenyan Roads Minister Kipkalya Kones and Assistant Minister of Home Affairs Lorna Laboso had been on board the Cessna 210, which was headed to Kericho, in the Rift Valley. The plane crashed in a remote area called Kajong'a, in western Kenya, Kibaki said. The president identified the two others killed as Kenneth Kiprono Bett, who worked for Kones, and the pilot. ""Our country has lost leaders of immense potential at their prime age and with a promising future,"" Kibaki said. ""Let us all remain united at this moment of sorrow as a nation."" Salim Lone, a government spokesman, told CNN earlier that the plane crashed about an hour after it took off from Nairobi's Wilson Airport around 2:18 p.m. local time (7:18 a.m. ET). ""This is terrible, and utterly unimaginable news for us in Kenya, where there has been so much suffering recently,"" Lone said. He did not know what caused the crash, but said, ""There is absolutely no hint of foul play. It looks like a terrible tragedy."" Both Kones and Laboso belonged to the Orange Democratic Movement party (ODM), which joined Kibaki's Party of National Unity (PNU) in a coalition government earlier this year under an United Nations-brokered agreement that brought an end to the violence that ripped the nation after Kibaki's disputed re-election in late December. More than 1,000 people were killed and 350,000 were displaced in the violence, according to the Kenyan Red Cross. Under the agreement, Kibaki retained the presidency while ODM leader Raila Odinga became prime minister. A new cabinet took office in April, with equal representation from both ODM and PNU. The officials' deaths came a day before parliamentary by-elections in five districts in Kenya.","Roads minister, assistant home affairs minister die in plane crash .
