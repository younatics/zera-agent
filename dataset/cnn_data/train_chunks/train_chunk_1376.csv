"Danah Vince, 20, from Bristol was found dead a year after she was cleared of causing or allowing the death of her baby, Paris . A young mother whose boyfriend was jailed for shaking their 16-week old baby to death - killed herself after being 'hounded and harassed' after the court case, her family have claimed. Danah Vince, 20, from Bristol was cleared of causing or allowing the death of her daughter, Paris, after she was found with 'catastrophic' head injuries. But the baby's father William Stephens, 25, was convicted of manslaughter and jailed for six years after he was found guilty of shaking the baby so hard she was bleeding from her eyes. Ms Vince's family have claimed that she was tormented by locals following the trial and killed herself one year later just hours after she was punched by three girls at a pub. Her mother Lisa, 40, said: 'A lot of people would be horrible to her in the street. They would be mean to her and she would also get threats and insults. 'She was harassed which meant that she started to stay in a lot rather than go out. It was obvious there were people who were never going to let it go away. 'There was also a lot of horrible stuff about her on the internet. People would say mean things to her and send nasty messages.' During the trial at Bristol Crown Court, the jury heard the young parents had a 'volatile' on-off relationship and social services became involved. Stephens was subject to a restraining order banning him from contacting Ms Vince, but the court was told he was still living with her and Paris at the time of her death. The thug - who had learning difficulties and an IQ in the low 50s - is thought to have lost control and shaken crying Paris while Ms Vince was out of the house, causing a fatal brain bleed in January 2013. Paris Vince-Stephens was just 16 weeks old when she was shaken so violenty by her father she died . Ms Vince's mother Lisa (looking at a picture of her daughter) said the 20-year-old was threatened after the trial . He was said to have become 'agitated' after running out of cannabis and later admitted that he 'slightly shook' the baby. Medics at Bristol Children's Hospital fought to save her for two days, and experts said her injuries were either caused by shaking or banging her head against a soft surface - or a combination of both. Despite walking free from court, her family claim Ms Vince was taunted via online messages, and when she returned to the Bear and Rugged Staff pub in Southmead, Bristol, she was attacked. Hours after the assault in November last year and almost a year after she was cleared of her daughter's death - she was found dead in her new home. William Stephens was jailed for six years for manslaughter after he caused the death of his daughter . Her father DJ, 41, said: 'I spoke to Danah on the Friday night when it happened. She was going out to the pub for a drink and she seemed fine, she seemed quite happy. 'I heard that three girls picked on her in the pub and intimidated her. She was pushed around and punched. That was the weekend she died. 'At the end of the day she was found not guilty and Williams was sent to prison for killing Paris. When the trial was over she made a real effort to rebuild her life. 'No one is saying that Danah is an angel. She had her problems like anyone else. But she would never have harmed her baby. 'She was a good mother and would have done anything for her daughter. 'There was a lot of stuff said about her in court but it was just not true.' Her family claim some of the accusations made about Ms Vince in court were false - including allegations she blew cannabis smoke into Paris' cot to keep her quiet . Her family claim some of the accusations made about Ms Vince  in court were false - including allegations she blew cannabis smoke into Paris' cot to keep her quiet. 'There were a lot of lies told about Danah in the court and there are a lot of people out there who just refuse to listen to the truth,' said her father. 'She was at her happiest when she was with Paris and she loved that baby. The problem was she kept letting Stephens come back into her life.' Her mother said that Ms Vince had tried to get her life back on track and had taken parenting classes. 'When Danah was found not guilty she was determined to get on with her life and make something of herself,' she said. 'After the court case she moved out of Southmead and took parenting classes. She tried to stay away from the people being horrible to her. 'The problem was all her family and friends are in the area so it was really tough for her. Ms Vince's  death is being investigated by the coroner and an inquest is expected to be held later this year.","William Stephens, 25, was jailed for shaking baby daughter Paris to death .

"Dogs  are digging up the corpses of Ebola victims buried in shallow graves in Liberia and eating them in the street, villagers have claimed. Furious residents of Johnsonville Township, outside capital Monrovia, raised the alarm after packs of wild dogs were spotted digging up corpses from a specially-designated 'Ebola graveyard', dragging them into the open and feeding on their flesh. It is the latest development in the epidemic, which was today confirmed to have reached Senegal. The grisly scenes in Liberia came three weeks after government health officials - desperate to stem the country's rising infection rate - hurriedly buried the bodies despite a heated standoff with villagers who refused to give their permission to use the land. But rather than resolve the dispute, Liberia's Ministry of Health burial team dug the graves at night to avoid further confrontation, making the infected bodies easy targets for scavengers, villagers say. Scroll down for video . Dead in the street: People gather around a man suspected of dying from Ebola in Monrovia . Now  fears are mounting that the dogs - which cannot grow sick from the strain of Ebola  running rampant through  West Africa but can carry it - will be able to pass it on to humans through licking or biting. 'We are very disappointed in the Health Ministry, especially the government that took an oath to defend and protect us,' Alfred Wiah told The New Dawn. 'To see them act in such manner is unacceptable and we’ll never allow the government come to bury any longer.' He added: 'They will be resisted by us because I think the government has failed to protect us. Why bring Ebola bodies and not bury them well?' While the dogs are unlikely to grow sick from the virus, there is a strong chance they could still pass it on to humans, Dr. Stephen Korsman of the University of Cape Town’s medical virology division told News 24. Death toll rising: A Liberian health worker sprays disinfectant outside a house before entering and removing the body of a man that they believe died from the Ebola virus in Monrovia . High death rate: So far Ebola has killed more than 1,500 of the 3,000 people it has sickened in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, according to an official count . Grisly task: Two nurses in protective suits enter a Liberian village to search for locals who have fallen ill . Infected: They escort an infected villager away, watched by a crowd of concerned locals . '[The dogs'] infections appear to be asymptomatic,' he said. 'This means that dogs won’t get sick, but they still could carry a potential risk through licking or biting.' The news comes as it was revealed the killer disease has reached Senegal, making it the fifth West African country to be affected by the outbreak. The country's Ministry of Health said a man infected with Ebola traveled to Senegal, bringing the disease to that country for the first time in an outbreak that has hit four other West African nations and killed more than 1,500 people. Health Minister Awa Marie Coll Seck told reporters that the infected person, a university student from Guinea, sought treatment at a hospital in Senegal's capital, Dakar, on Tuesday but gave no indication he might have Ebola. The next day, an epidemiological surveillance team in Guinea alerted Senegalese authorities that they had lost track of a person who had had contact with sick people. The team said that the person disappeared three weeks ago and may have come to Senegal. Spreading: Senegal's Health Minister, Awa Marie Coll Seck (pictured), revealed today that Ebola had reached Senegalese capital Dakar after a university student from Guinea checked into hospital there on Tuesday . Fears: The news comes as scientists claimed the Ebola virus disease is rapidly and continually mutating, making it harder to diagnose and treat . The student was tracked to the hospital in Dakar that same day and was immediately quarantined, Seck said. A test has confirmed that he has Ebola, and the World Health Organization has been alerted. Ebola emerged in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in Sudan and near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo. There are several strains which vary in how dangerous they are to humans, but death rates have reached as high as 90 per cent. In the current outbreak it is just over 50 per cent. The virus is introduced into humans through direct contact with the blood, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals including fruit bats, which are eaten as a delicacy, and possibly now dogs. The virus then spreads between humans through direct contact with blood, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people. Symptoms include fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. People are infectious as long as their blood and bodily fluids contain the virus and the incubation period can range between two and 21 days. Although the disease has no cure, modern medical treatment and quick isolation help hugely to bring the death toll down. Source: World Health Organisation . And in a further blow to the fight against the outbreak, scientists today claimed the Ebola virus disease is rapidly and continually mutating, making it harder to diagnose and treat. A study of the initial patients diagnosed with the virus in Sierra Leone revealed almost 400 genetic modifications. And it could be detrimental not only to current treatments, but also to future vaccines that are in the works. The team of researchers, led by the Broad Institute in Massachusetts and Harvard University, analysed more than 99 Ebola virus genomes. Also today, the World Health Organization revealed that the past week has seen the highest increase of Ebola cases since the outbreak in West Africa began. The U.N. health agency warned yesterday that the outbreak in West Africa is accelerating and could eventually infect as many as 20,000 people. So far it has killed more than 1,500 of the 3,000 people it has sickened in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, according to an official count. The U.N. health agency said yesterday it assumes that in many hard-hit areas, the actual number of cases may be two to four times higher than is currently reported. In a detailed report on the outbreak published today, the WHO said more than 500 cases were recorded over the past week, by far the worst toll of any week so far. The vast majority of the cases were in Liberia, but the agency said it was also the highest number of cases in one week for Guinea and Sierra Leone. Nigeria has also recorded a small number of cases.","Officials hurriedly buried bodies in middle of night so locals would not know .

"Turkish holiday: Sandra Bainbridge, with Derek Joyner, was stabbed more than 70 times at her home in Derbyshire by Andrea Cutler . A grandmother was stabbed to death by a schizophrenic drug addict who broke into her home while she was on holiday. Sandra Bainbridge, 70, returned from Turkey to find Andrea Cutler had taken over her 18th century listed cottage and assumed her identity. The intruder stabbed her 73 times and left her body under a duvet in the back yard. Mrs Bainbridge’s lover and holiday companion almost suffered the same fate when he turned up 24 hours later. Following a trail of blood upstairs Derek Joyner ran into Cutler holding a knife. After a struggle the 70-year-old grandfather of four fled and called police. But Mr Joyner was himself briefly put under arrest when police arrived and found no sign of Cutler. The 39-year-old had stolen her victim’s Nissan Pixo and was detained when the vehicle triggered a number plate camera the next day. Last night Mr Joyner described his encounter with Cutler as like ‘being in a horror film without the music’. ‘I remember the light from the room catching the eight-inch blade,’ he told the Mail. ‘I just slammed the door and held the handle. ‘She grabbed the handle from the other side and I could feel her getting the better of me and forcing the handle down. ‘I realised right there and then that I was fighting for my life and that I could not let go of that handle. ‘The narrow staircase represented the only way out and as I felt her grip weaken slightly I made up my mind to go for it. ‘I just kept picturing that knife being plunged through my back.’ The pair grappled in the porch before Cutler broke away, allowing Mr Joyner to escape. Detectives discovered that Cutler had adopted Mrs Bainbridge’s identity after forcing her way into the cottage five days earlier. She changed her home phone number and credit card PIN which she was able to use to buy a pair of shoes, a handbag and provisions. Nottingham Crown Court heard that Cutler had a long history of mental illness but was free to wander the streets despite being delusional and psychotic. Her mental health began to deteriorate after she started taking cannabis at the age of 15. She moved on to heroin, amphetamines, crack cocaine and ecstasy and both her children were taken into care. Sean Smith QC, prosecuting, said Cutler first developed mood swings in 1993 and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in 1994. She threatened to kill her adoptive parents at least twice and was sectioned in 2005. Guilty: Cutler, pictured, stabbed Sandra Bainbridge 73 times in the attack. She had a history of mental illness . In the year leading up to the attack, Cutler had repeatedly failed to attend medical appointments and refused to take mood stabilising drugs and other medication. In September 2013 she started a hate campaign against Amelia Horne, a former school friend who owned a café in Derby. She was cautioned for threatening to kill her and was then charged after she made further visits to the cafe. Cutler failed to show up at court in December and a warrant was issued for her arrest. The intruder stabbed Mrs Bainbridge in her 18th century cottage, above, and left her body in the back yard . She had left her Derby home however and slept rough in nearby Belper the night before she broke in to Mrs Bainbridge’s home. Cutler admitted manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility and was given an indefinite hospital custody order. She had been charged with murder until doctors concluded she was suffering from schizo-affective psychosis. Kajal Patel, a psychiatrist who sits on the medical parole board, told Judge Gregory Dickinson QC that Cutler’s history suggested the crime ‘happened largely because she was not complying with her treatment’. In a victim impact statement read to the court, Ms Bainbridge's partner Derek Joyner, right, said it was 'like a horror movie without the music'. Left,  Mrs Bainbridge . Derbyshire Healthcare Trust said staff had made ‘great efforts to try and engage’ with Cutler. It is taking part in an independent homicide inquiry into the case. In the year leading up to the attack, Cutler, above, had repeatedly failed to attend medical appointments and refused to take medication . Mr Joyner, a retired educationalist, met mother-of-three and former civil servant Mrs Bainbridge at a real ale tasting session in 2009. The two divorcees had planned to fly to Mexico for a ‘trip of a lifetime’ last January but the departure date turned out to be Mrs Bainbridge’s funeral. Judge Dickinson said her life had been ‘cut short in the most brutal and shocking’ manner by a ‘feckless, self-centred woman driven only by a desire for drugs’. The judge said Cutler had gone to ground because she realised a warrant would be issued for her arrest. He described the attack as ‘degrading’ and said Mrs Bainbridge was afforded no dignity in death. Of the 73 stab wounds, more than 40 were around the head, face and neck. But Mrs Bainbridge also suffered 13 stab wounds between her legs, possibly after death. In a statement outside court, Mrs Bainbridge’s family said Cutler was ‘aware that she needed to take medication, but refused to do so’. They added: ‘She chose a life of drug taking and crime and rejected the treatment, help and support she was offered. Her conscious choices made her into what she is – a merciless and vicious killer. ‘It is presently unclear whether action could have been taken to prevent what she did to Sandra Bainbridge. The authorities must now ensure that she is never at liberty to kill again.’ 'Sandra Bainbridge was a vibrant, fit person who loved life. She was adventurous, active and full of fun. A marvellous and unique person has been taken from her family and friends. 'They also have to live with the horrific knowledge of what she went through at the hands of Andrea Cutler. 'Andrea Cutler is completely responsible for the terrible crime she committed. She was aware that she needed to take medication, but refused to do so. She chose a life of drug taking and crime and rejected the treatment, help and support she was offered. 'Her conscious choices made her into what she is - a merciless and vicious killer. Her actions were not those of a person lashing out in fear, or even in anger. She was calculating and calm when planning and executing her crimes. 'She stabbed an innocent person 73 times and deliberately and horribly mutilated her. It is purely by chance that she did not kill others. Andrea Cutler is, and will remain, a cruel, unstable and very dangerous person. 'She has shown no remorse and no emotion when the details of her crime have been described in court. It is presently unclear whether action could have been taken to prevent what she did to Sandra Bainbridge. 'The authorities must now ensure that she is never at liberty to kill again.'","Sandra Bainbridge was killed after she returned home from holiday .

"The bailiffs didn’t stand a chance. By the time they arrived to turf cancer patient Tom Crawford out of his home yesterday a crowd of some 500 had gathered to block their way. For a few minutes there was a stand-off between the crowd and the burly men inside a white van and a black car. And then, with cheers ringing in their ears, the bailiffs backed off. Scroll down for video . People power: 500 strangers turn up at the home of cancer-stricken Tom Crawford to stop bailiffs evicting him from his home . It was the latest episode in Mr Crawford’s battle to keep his home. The grandfather, who is suffering from prostate cancer, has been battling the bailiffs over claims he still owes thousands in mortgage repayments on the bungalow. Mr Crawford, 63, said he ‘would rather die’ than give up the home he has shared with his wife Susan for the past 27 years. Last July, after he posted a video online begging for help, more than 300 friends and strangers successfully stopped bailiffs from kicking him out. And yesterday, six months after the first eviction attempt, bailiffs were forced to abandon their efforts again. Bailiffs were greeted by a sea of people after serving their second eviction notice on Mr Crawford and his wife, Sue . The YouTube video has now been shared more than 25,500 times and backing for Mr Crawford’s cause shows no signs of waning, with supporters travelling hundreds of miles to join the protest outside his home in Carlton, Nottinghamshire, again. He had been ordered to leave his property by 10.30am yesterday. But supporters began congregating in the road before 7am. At around 11am a white transit van and black Mercedes containing the bailiffs arrived at the bungalow – only to have to drive away. Tom Crawford, pictured outside his bungalow, had been ordered to be out of his home by 10.30am today . The strangers provided a human shield around the bungalow to stop the bailiffs from getting to it . Yesterday, Mr Crawford said: ‘I am humbled by all the people here. All I did was make a little video about what was happening to us and people supported it.’ Mr Crawford claims he has paid off his mortgage, which he took out with the now defunct Bradford and Bingley in 1988. But UK Asset Resolution Limited, charged with winding down Bradford and Bingley mortgages, claims he still owes £43,000. Mr Crawford, who is battling prostate cancer, has said that he would 'rather die' than leave his home . Surrounded: One of the cars carrying the bailiffs was held back from the Crawfords' home of 27 years . Many of the protesters filmed and photographed the bailiffs as they arrived at the property in two separate vehicles . Last year a judge ruled against the couple and ordered them to pay off the sum or face eviction. But the Crawfords claim that these arrears only exist because of blunder by the bank. They say they believed they were paying off their mortgage when in fact they were paying only interest. In an effort to keep his home, the retired flooring specialist posted a video explaining his predicament on YouTube. The father-of-three said: ‘I will never leave my home. I would rather die than leave.’ Mr Crawford said: 'There are not enough words in the English Dictionary for how I feel' Supporters donned 'I am Tom Crawford' hats as they surrounded his home to keep bailiffs out . The strangers turned up at Mr Crawford's home after he posted a video on YouTube explaining his situation online . Supporters called for the bailiffs to stop harassing the couple. Eric Banner, 30, who lives in Nottingham, said: ‘What has happened to Tom is a complete injustice. He has done nothing wrong.’ Tim Fleming, 69, a charity worker from Twickenham, said: ‘It is important to come and support Tom because it could be me tomorrow. We won’t be beaten.’ Mr Crawford and his wife, 54, took out an endowment mortgage to buy the bungalow for £41,800 27 years ago. They expected to own the property outright when the loan came to an end last year.

"The  jihadi gunman who killed a police woman and four hostages at a kosher deli in Paris was buried near the French capital today after his own country of birth  refused him. Mali had rejected the body of terrorist Amedy Coulibaly on Wednesday- the day before he was expected to be buried in its soil in Bamako. Now police sources say the Islamist- who killed a policewoman and four Jewish hostage during the January 7-9 attacks on Paris-  has been buried in the Muslim section of the Thiais cemetery in the Paris region. Scroll down for video . Nowhere to go: The body of French jihadi Amedy Coulibaly has been rejected by his birth country, Mali. Coulibaly killed four customers of a kosher supermarket as well as a policewoman . The 32-year-old small-time dope dealer-cum-terrorist was gunned down by police as they raided the Hyper Cacher kosher supermarket in east Paris on January 9, the day police tracked down Charlie Hebdo massacre gunmen Chérif and Saïd Kouachi. A day earlier he had shot dead a policewoman in the street and critically injured a street sweeper. His family had asked for him to be buried in Mali, but that country's government made a sudden U-turn the day before his burial. The West African country gave no reason for rejecting the killer's body which had remained in a fridge in the Forensic Institute in Paris until he was interred in Thiais today. Government spokesman Stephane Le Foll had confirmed he would be buried in France if his country of birth refused to accept his body. The Kouachi brothers, who were Frenchmen of Algerian heritage, were both buried in secret locations in their hometowns - Saïd in Rheims and Chérif in Gennevilliers, a suburb north of Paris - last weekend. Both were interred at night in unmarked graves, as authorities feared their resting places could become places of pilgrimage for extremists. The brothers were killed in a shoot-out after hiding in an industrial unit, two days after the attack on the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, in which they killed 12 people. Charlie Hebdo killers: The Kouachi brothers, who were Frenchmen of Algerian heritage, were both buried in secret locations in their hometowns - Saïd in Rheims and Chérif in Gennevilliers, a suburb north of Paris . Neither brothers' hometown wanted the terrorists, but were forced to find graves for them by a French law that grants a right to be buried in the district where the deceased lived or the district where they were killed. French media reports that no request for a grave has been made in Grigny, the impoverished south Paris suburb where Coulibaly grew up and where his mother and sister still live, nor in Viry-Chatillon, where he was registered to vote. So it seems most likely Coulibaly will be buried in Fontenay-aux-Roses, the Paris suburb where he had rented a safe house. A spokesman for the town's mayor said: 'If his family decide to bury him here, I don't think we'll be able to avoid it. The law is strict. But we hope he will be buried somewhere else.'","Sources say Amedy Coulibaly was buried in the Thiais cemetery in Paris .

"A woman who grew up believing that she was a white Jewish girl with two Caucasian parents has created a powerful documentary which details her discovery that her biological father is actually a black man with whom her mother had a brief affair. Lacey Schwartz, 37, only learned the truth about her birth – and her heritage – when she was 18 years old, while she was applying to college and was identified by one of the institutions as being black. After hearing back from the college, Ms Schwartz immediately confronted her mother and learned that she was conceived while her mom was having an affair with a black man named Rodney. Scroll down for video . Family secret: Lacy Schwartz (left) is a biracial woman who grew up believing that she was white. After learning that her biological father was black, she began to film her journey for her documentary Little White Lie . Racial identity: Despite having a dark complexion and curly hair, the 37-year-old filmmaker said she always believed she was a white Jewish girl from Woodstock, New York . The filmmaker, who was raised in an upper-middle-class household in Woodstock, New York, decided to chronicle the discovery of her new racial identity in a documentary titled Little White Lie, which she began filming as a college student. 'I come from a long line of New York Jews,' Ms Schwartz explained in the film. 'I grew up in a world of synagogue, Hebrew school and bar mitzvahs, so it never occurred to me that I was [different].' She noted: 'I wasn't pretending to be something I wasn't. I actually grew up believing I was white.' Her mom never told her husband that Ms Schwartz wasn't his biological daughter and instead credited her complexion to a dark-skinned Sicilian grandfather. Despite questions about her skin color and dark curly hair, Ms Schwartz said she always identified as being white. White lie: Ms Schwartz's mother (pictured), who had a secret affair with a black man named Rodney, credited her daughter's dark skin to a Sicilian grandfather . Family tradition: Ms Schwartz (pictured) said she grew up going to Hebrew school and synagogue in a predominately white community, so it never occurred to her that she was different . 'If you looked too closely at it, it didn't make any sense, so we found ways to see what we wanted to believe,' she said of her family's secret. Ms Schwartz's childhood friend Samara noted: 'I always looked at you like you looked black but not that you were.' She added: 'It really is the power of denial. How the hell did anybody not acknowledge this?' When Ms Schwartz applied to Georgetown University as an undergraduate student she left the box regarding racial identity blank. 'The only box I had known was white,' she said, 'so I just didn't check anything and based off a photograph, I was accepted as a black student.' Following her acceptance, she received a letter from the university's Black Student Alliance. Ms Schwartz was left to confront her parents, who have since divorced, about the truth regarding her race – having never thought to question them about it in the past. Good times: Ms Schwartz (center) posed with her family on the day of her bat mitvah . Next step: Ms Schwartz (pictured) also created a companion website for Little White Lie, where people can anonymously share their family secrets as a way to move forward . 'I was afraid of not being a part of the world she had grown up in anymore,' she said of learning the truth. Her mother explained her infidelity and 'white lie' to her daughter by noting: 'Lacey, you have to realize, before I was your mother, I was a person, and I was a girl and I was a woman.' Ms Schwartz told Vox that she now identifies as 'black/biracial', although she believes that the documentary is about more than just her race. 'I think the film's broader lesson is about the power of telling the truth, having difficult conversations and then moving forward.' Little White Lie was released in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington DC late last year and will air on PBS on March 23. In addition to the film, Ms Schwartz created a website where people can anonymously share their family secrets.","Lacey Schwartz, 37, was raised to believe that she was a white Jewish girl .

The two-toned pouches and contrasting collared shirts are particularly useful during a quick getaway, no matter where you are in the world. Karlie's fellow Victoria's Secret Angel, Candice Swanepoel has also taken to Instagram to share the contents of her carry-all . Candice and fellow supermodel, Joan Smalls, recently headed to London from New York City for the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show . 'Forever packing suitcases,' Victoria's Secret Angel, Candice Swanepoel, captioned her #TravelinStyle Instagram snap. And as one of the top earning models in the world, we're not surprised. Among her most coveted posessions is a personalised black Schutz bag, as well as a collection of trainers and even a baseball cap for a casual off-duty look. And sticking true to her fashion-forward roots, the 26-year-old supermodel was also sure to add some Rag & Bone to her suitcase. Kim's purse essentials include Cosmopolitan, a Blackberry and iPhone, LaMer moisturiser, a snack bar and, of course, stylish sunnies . Proud sis! Reality star Kim Kardashian used a snap of her in-transit essentials as a way to show off her little sister's Cosmopolitan cover . Whether travelling with husband Kanye West or fulfilling her own media commitments around the globe, it seems like Kim Kardashian spends most of her life in transit. Before an early call-time, Kim took to Instagram to share her purse essentials, which would undoubtedly all come in useful during a long-haul flight. Among her must-haves was her little sister Kylie Jenner's most recent accomplishment: a Cosmopolitan cover. Kim also packed a coconut snack bar, Hype energy drink, rosewater (because she's 'obsessed with the scent'), as well as a travel-sized version of LaMer's signature moisturiser. Like Karlie, Kim also opted for both a Blackberry and an iPhone and her trademark accessory: a pair of stylish sunglasses. If you've ever wondered what is inside Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's luggage, the model has taken to social media to reveal all... From day to night: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is always the epitome of travel style perfection, seen here at LAX . As Who What Wear's latest monthly contributor, Rosie Huntington- Whiteley isn't shy when it comes to sharing her style tips. For her first column, the British supermodel and actress revealed all of her airport and travel must-haves, which include everything from a pair of statement Alaia boots to Lena Dunham's best-selling book, Not That Kind Of Girl. 'Travelling is a big part of my job,' she told Who What Wear. 'Over the years, I've learned the importance of an unfussy airport outfit.' 'Long hauls call for pieces that keep you cosy on the plane, but also make you feel good upon arrival.' During a recent trip to London, Rosie filled her suitcase with a cashmere sweater from Acne, a Saint Laurent bag and scarf, Balenciaga leather pants and weekend bag, a casual Paige t-shirt, a Eugenia Kim hat, Miu Miu sunglasses and a coat by The Row. When it comes to serious airport style, model Kendall opts for a matching set of (extremely expensive) Louis Vuitton luggage . Nineteen year old Kendall Jenner has clearly learned a thing or two about packing from her jet-setting older sister, Kim Kardashian . When it comes to travelling in style, it's clearly an instance of younger sisters learning from their older siblings. Model of the moment, Kendall Jenner, posted an impressive collection of Louis Vuitton luggage to the social networking site, along with an emoji of a plane - no doubt inspired by big sister Kim's stylish airport ensembles. Louis Vuitton's Zephyr range starts at £2,140, while the brand's similar rolling Pegase model starts at £1,950.","Models, fashion designers and actresses alike have all recently taken to Instagram to share their travel essentials .

Please change it back,' she said . 'What engineering genius came up with this flawed design? Apart from trying to cut the plastic against a movable cutting edge and ending up in a bloody, every time you go to open the lid you nearly slice your finger open,' an agitated man said.

'All changes were made in response to customer feedback, with the intention of improving the value and usage experience. We wanted to give our customers a much better experience and better value, at no extra cost,' a Glad Wrap representative said. 'Before making these changes, Glad completed rigorous and extensive in-home research in Australia, receiving positive feedback from Australians who participated in the research.

Steve Ellis said he nearly slices his finger open every time he uses the new box . 'Yah I thought I was going mad. I though I opened the box wrong. I'm so pleased you are putting the cutter on the new side. Do not like the new way,' one customer said.

"The world's biggest barbecue pit, which stretches an incredible 76ft and weighs a staggering 40 tons, has gone on sale for  $350,000. With the ability to cook up four tons of meat at any one time, the 'Undisputable Cuz' is the behemoth of barbecue. The pit, which attracts a lot of attention in it's hometown of Brenham, Texas, has seven smokestacks, 24 doors and a walk-in cooler with space for kegs attached to beer taps on the outside.

The 18-speed Peterbilt truck which used to hauled it is thrown in for an extra $50,000. The heat for the barbecue, which is carried along the rig by a tube,  comes from a relatively small fire that burns just a couple of cords of wood. The Folsoms, who park in in their front yard, told USA Today that its original owner used to take it on tour. But Terry, who acquired it in a business deal, said he was happy to sell to a wealthy buyer and has listed the barbecue pit on eBay. 'Some people tell me we ought to put it back on tour,' Kim  said. 'But I'd rather just sell it and get it gone.' 'Get me a certified check and bring it on over here and give it to me they'll own it,' added Terry. 'I'll take it right where they'll need it.'

"A tiny home in south west London that measures just eight and a half feet wide has gone on the market for  £300,000. Sandwiched between two normal-sized houses, the property in Twickenham still manages to contain a fully equipped kitchen and two beds, though one of them is snuggled up on a mezzanine level above the fridge, and the other is tucked into the sitting room. Despite its small size, it backs on to a huge garden that has almost five times as much space as the property itself. The house has 322sq ft of living space, compared to the lawn which measures 1,562sq ft. Tiny terrace: This skinny property in Twickenham, south west London, measures just eight and a half foot wide with 322sq ft of space . Huge: By contrast the lawn at the back of the house measures 1,562sq ft, making it nearly five times larger than the interior . Narrow: The living room opens out on to this narrow walkway, but through the gate at the end of the path is the property's huge garden . Kitted out: It may not look like it from the outside, but the house has a fully furnished kitchen along with two beds, though on is tucked away on a mezzanine above the fridge, and the other is in the living room . Cosy: The home was originally built as a granny flat and was attached to one of the neighbouring properties, but has since been turned into a home of its own . The garden also contains a shed which measures 17.7ft by 6.5ft, making it significantly wider than the main building. The skinny property was originally built as a 'granny flat' for the house next door, but is now being sold as one unit. Set back from the main road, It comes with its own driveway and off-street parking. The previous owner had tried to get permission several years ago to knock down the main home, turn it into a driveway and have the garden turned into a house, but the local authority rejected the application. Although it's only been on the market for a week, Russell Gooden, who is handling the sale for estate agent Jackson-Stops & Staff has been overwhelmed by interest. Russell said: 'It's a fantastic property but quite an unusual one to show people round. It's a bit of a marmite house - people either love it or hate it - but I think it will be sold very quickly. 'Though I don't think it's one for two people unless you're very close! I've never seen anything like it - especially because the garden is so large. 'We're certainly enjoying having it on our books.'

"An Israeli hairdresser has created an 'invisible' skullcap made from human hair so Jewish men can cover their heads without fear of being targeted in anti-Semitic attacks. Barber Shalom Koresh fashioned the skullcap - or kippa in Hebrew - from hair samples to obscure wearers' identities as Jews following a rise in anti-Semitism in Europe. The caps are proving particularly popular in France, Mr Koresh says, which has seen a spate of  attacks on Jews in recent years, including the recent killing of four Jews in the hostage stand-off at a kosher supermarket in Paris. An Israeli hairdresser has created skullcaps made from hair so Jewish men can cover their heads without fear of being targeted in anti-Semitic attacks . The hair pieces were created by barber Shalom Koresh, who has seen particular interest from Jews in France following that attacks in Paris . 'This skullcap is washable, you can brush it, you can dye it,' Mr Koresh said in his salon in central Israel. 'It was created so people could feel comfortable going to places where they are afraid to go, or places where they can't wear it, and feel secure.' The hairdresser's skullcap, which he calls the 'Magic Kippa', comes in different colours. Prices start at around £37 for synthetic hair while caps made from natural hair cost just under £60. The skullcap, which can be washed and dyed, is fastened onto the wearer's real hair with hidden clips. Maor Hania, who models the hairpiece at the salon, said: 'You don't feel a thing. It feels like it is part of your hair. There isn't such a difference between this and a regular kippa. It feels the same.' Devout Jewish men traditionally wear skullcaps as a sign of respect and reverence for God. The kippas come in different colours and cost between £37 and £60 for either synthetic or natural hair caps . The skullcap, which can be washed and dyed, can be fastened onto the wearer's real hair with hidden clips . Rabbi Shlomo Aviner, who teaches at a prominent Jerusalem yeshiva, said that skullcaps must be visible but that Jews who were 'in danger' could conceal them. Recent anti-Semitic attacks have deepened fears among Jewish communities in Europe, with many feeling vulnerable to discrimination. The attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris saw terrorist Amedy Coulibaly kill Jews Yoav Hattab, 21, Yohan Cohen, 20, Philippe Braham, 45 and Francois-Michel Saada, 64. The bodies of all four men were flown to Jerusalem to be buried. Following the attacks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu encouraged European Jews to move to the Jewish state, saying he would welcome them with 'open arms'. A 2013 EU report found that one in five European Jews avoid wearing kippas or other Jewish symbols for fear of being harassed or attacked. The skullcap could also serve Jews travelling to the Middle East, where some Arab countries can be hostile to Jews.","Israeli hairdresser has created 'invisible' skullcap made from human hair .

"A graduate who impressed bosses by standing in a railway station  handing out his CV has returned to the same spot to recruit workers to his new company. Determined Alfred Ajani was so sick of filling in job application forms and getting no reply, he took to the concourse of Waterloo station in London to come face-to-face with city high-flyers. After he was snapped up by a recruitment firm, he's now returned to the same place where he once stood to advertise positions on his team. Scroll down for video . Alfred Ajani stood in Waterloo Station in August (left) handing out CVs to passing commuters as he struggled to find a job. After his attempts paid off, he is now working at a recruitment firm and returned to the same spot yesterday (right) in a bid to find graduate job-seekers . Alfred, 22, received widespread praise on social media last August when a commuter spotted him holding a sign which said: 'Marketing Graduate (BA Hons 2:1 Coventry Uni) - Ask for a CV.' The south Londoner's unique method of finding work paid off and he received a number of offers of jobs in business, marketing and recruitment. Two weeks after his job-seeking stunt, he took a role with recruitment consultancy The Asoria Group, which are based just one hundred yards from the station. Alfred is now part of a team looking to expand the company's workforce and went back to Waterloo yesterday as part of his search for new employees. He posted a picture of himself  five months ago next to a new photo of him holding a new sign stating: 'Now I'm Hiring'. The picture, which has since been retweeted more than 2,000 times, was accompanied by the caption: 'Same spot, different sign'. Alfred told MailOnline: 'It felt great to be back at the same place and be looking for people who, like me a few months ago, are looking for a good job. 'I've loved my role since taking it and there hasn't been one minute where I've regretted my decision.' Alfred had applied for 300 positions before he headed to Waterloo station on an early morning last August. After the stunt was praised on social media, colleagues at his new firm made T-shirts in his honour . He added: 'I didn't want to be back looking for a job again, or standing in the station for a second time, so I'm really pleased with how it has gone. 'The company is expanding and we're looking to take people on to the desk where I'm working so we are now searching for graduates, people in the same position I was last year. We've got around 20 vacancies. 'It feels good to be putting something back and I'm hoping to take the brand to universities over the next year. 'The latest picture has had a good response and I've already been sent some CVs through social media.' Alfred started work at the Asoria Group in September after a boss at the company saw his Waterloo stunt. In recognition of his social media fame, colleagues at the firm wore T-shirts with his picture on them to welcome him on his first day. He has since been made the subject of a short film by youth channel Million Youth Media. It emerged last month that prospects for graduates are improving in the UK, with an eight per cent rise in the number of graduate vacancies at Britain's biggest firms. Latest statistics show  unemployment among 16 to 24-year-olds has dropped from 22 per cent in 2011 to around 16 per cent. As part of his role at recruitment consultancy, The Asoria Group, he is now hiring new employees .

"Federal prosecutors should launch a civil rights probe into the 2013 death of a mentally ill Rikers Island inmate who was locked in his cell for six days without care or medication, a state oversight panel concluded in a review that called the treatment 'so incompetent and inadequate as to shock the conscience.' Bradley Ballard, a 39-year-old paranoid schizophrenic with diabetes, died shortly after a doctor finally went into his cell and found him naked, covered in feces and badly infected from a piece of cloth he tied tightly around his genitals. The review by the New York State Commission of Correction, obtained by The Associated Press, said the lapses by the city and its medical provider, Corizon Health Inc., violated state law and 'were directly implicated in his death.' Probe: Federal prosecutors are being asked to launch a civil rights probe into the 2013 death of Bradley Ballard, 39 (photographed), a mentally ill Riker's Island inmate who was left for days in his cell with no medication and an overflowing toilet . Mother: Here, Beverly Ann Griffin, the mother of Bradley Ballard who died in 2013 at the Rikers Island jail, cries as her lawyer, Jonathan Abady, speaks during a news conference in New York . 'Had Ballard received adequate and appropriate medical and mental health care and supervision and intervention when he became critically ill, his death would have been prevented,' the report said. 'The medical and mental health care ... was so incompetent and inadequate as to shock the conscience.' The AP first reported the details of Ballard's death last year soon after it reported another mentally ill inmate, Jerome Murdough, died last February after he was left unattended for hours in a cell that sweltered to 101-degrees because of malfunctioning heating equipment. The two cases prompted calls for reform, an oversight hearing and contributed to Mayor Bill de Blasio's recent pledge to spend $130 million over four years to divert people with behavioral disorders to treatment instead of Rikers. Officials estimate about 40 percent of the roughly 11,000 daily New York City inmates have a mental health diagnosis. 'Every day I'm thinking about him,' said Ballard's mother, Beverly Ann Griffin. 'I'm so angry with what they did to him.' Found: Ballard, a paranoid schizophrenic with diabetes, died shortly after a doctor went into his cell and found him naked, covered in feces and badly infected from a piece of cloth he tied tightly around his genitals (here Ballard is 16 years old) City officials said in statements that since Ballard's death mental health workers and jail guards have received more training on how to communicate better. Dr. Sonia Angell, a deputy commissioner with the city Health Department, said a Corizon mental health unit chief in charge of the mental observation unit that housed Ballard was transferred to a smaller facility with fewer responsibilities after the death. And jails Commissioner Joseph Ponte said a new housing unit where mentally ill inmates get therapy, along with more training for guards in how to work with mentally ill inmates, would improve conditions. Corizon spokeswoman Susan Morgenstern said an internal investigation was launched after Ballard's death but declined to provide details, citing legal reasons. The medical examiner ruled Ballard's death a homicide and said he was killed by diabetic ketoacidosis which occurs when people don't have enough insulin and the liver breaks down fat instead. Dr. Phyllis Harrison-Ross, the commissioner of the state oversight panel, recommended in the report that the U.S. Department of Justice open a criminal investigation into Ballard's death, as well as more comprehensive investigations into both the 2,300-bed Rikers facility where Ballard was held and Corizon. 'Incompetent:' State investigators called Ballard's treatment at Rikers 'incompetent' even before his fateful final lockup, noting that his psychotropic medication had been mistakenly switched, which made him more irritable, and he didn't receive regular insulin for his Type 2 diabetes . A DOJ spokeswoman said officials would review the report. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are currently suing jail officials to quell what they've called pervasive violence in Rikers facilities. State prosecutors in the Bronx are still reviewing Ballard's case. Jonathan Chasan, one of the lawyers representing his family in a civil wrongful death lawsuit, called the state's review 'profoundly devastating.' Ballard had a long history of mental illness and had an earlier assault conviction in New York. He was brought to Rikers from Texas in 2013 for changing his address without notifying his parole officer. State investigators called Ballard's treatment at Rikers 'incompetent' even before his fateful final lockup,  noting that his psychotropic medication had been mistakenly switched, which made him more irritable, and he didn't receive regular insulin for his Type 2 diabetes. After making a lewd gesture at a jail guard, investigators found that Ballard was locked up alone in his mental observation cell for six days and eight hours, a more detailed accounting than in earlier reports. Water was turned off after he flooded his cell and he was visited only twice in brief, minute-long episodes by health workers making rounds. At one point a jail guard sprayed deodorizer outside his cell, but did not get him help. Training: City officials said in statements that since Ballard's death mental health workers and jail guards have received more training on how to communicate better . Mental Health Diagnosis: Officials estimate about 40 percent of the roughly 11,000 daily New York City inmates have a mental health diagnosis . The review found that at least three top jail officials passed by Ballard's cell during the six-day stretch though none ever summoned medical staff. One official, then-deputy warden Turhan Gumusdere, is seen on video outside Ballard's cell in that time, according to two city officials familiar with the footage who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing criminal probe. Gumusdere has since been promoted to warden of the facility. When Ballard's cell door was finally opened, a doctor and a licensed nurse practitioner ordered two inmates to use a blanket to pick a weak Ballard up and put him on a gurney. 'I need help,' Ballard told the doctor. He died in a hospital hours later after suffering three heart attacks in quick succession.","Federal prosecutors are being asked to launch a probe into the 2013 death of Bradley Ballard, 39 .

"An outgoing Connecticut fire captain stole some vintage photos of a young victim of the historic Hartford circus fire from the walls of the firehouse and burned them at his own home, saying he could not retire knowing the little girl was being displayed in such an inappropriate way. William Pond, the now-former Captain of the Hartford Fire Department, said he felt the pictures of the dead eight-year-old were 'publicly displayed in this horrific manner', particularly because the girl was naked. The victim was Eleanor Cook, who was one of more than 167 people who died in the massive tent fire at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in Hartford in July 1944, according to NBC News. The images of Cook's body are believed to have been part of a display of photos from the scene of the disaster, which had been at the Engine 14 firehouse location for years. Over 700 were injured in the horrific big top blaze, which lead to an overhaul of fire procedure changes and is considered one of the worst fires in U.S. history. Scroll down for video . Historic: The 1944 blaze at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in Hartford killed 167 people and injured another 700, after the big top went up in flames during the show . Killed: Eleanor Cook, 8, was one of the victims of the circus fire. Pictures of her body from the tragedy had been up on the walls of the Hartford Engine 14 fire station until recently . Burnt to the ground: The wake of the fire can be seen in this aerial photo from 1944 . Casualties: There were 7,000 people at the circus at the tie of the fire, and 167 of the died and a further 700 were injured. Here a makeshift morgue is made at the state armory in Hartford to house the dead . What Capt. Pond chose to do with the photos was recently revealed in an email that he sent to the incoming Captain, Carlos Huertas, which was obtained by NBC. Pond explained in the email how he first felt the images were inappropriate when he started at the firehouse as a young man, and that his feelings continued up until becoming captain in 2011. 'When originally assigned to engine 14 in the summer of 1990 I objected to the naked deceased pictures of Eleanor Cook displayed in the hallway,' Pond said in the email. 'I objected verbally to every house Captain through my career where my efforts proved fruitless. 'My first order of business as house Captain was to remove them from display.' Pond said he believed he had to do more than just pull he photos down, the emails said. 'I removed them today and at my home prayed for peace for Eleanor and burned them in my fireplace. 'I hope you understand and also the Cook family had no knowledge that there [sic] loved one was publicly displayed in this horrific manor [sic].' He added that he thought 'this poor girls [sic] soul would never rest' if the photos were put back up after he retired. Pond retired over 18 months ago, however the email has only just come to light. One last job: Outgoing Hartford Fire Department Captain William Pond said he could not leave his position without pulling down the photos of eight-year-old victim Eleanor Cook and destroying them . Criticized: New Captain Carlos Huertas (left) said what Pond chose to do at the Engine 14 firehouse (right) 'demonstrated a lack of professionalism' and 'exercised poor judgment' However, at the time, his judgement was not appreciated by Capt Huertas, Pond's successor, who criticized Pond for acting inappropriately. He said Pond 'exercised poor judgment in removing the photos'. 'He has demonstrated a lack of professionalism in his decision to take matters in to his own hands and circumvented the process put forth to better handle the situation,' Huertas told NBC. Huertas also said that while Pond likely thought he was destroying originals, the photos turned out to be copies with 'no intrinsic value'. During the fire on July 6, 1944, there were 7,000 people at the circus. Most of those in attendance were women and children. The Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus was the largest in the country at the time, and their big top could seat 9,000 people. The big top had been waterproofed with paraffin wax, which was a common waterproofing method. The cause of the fire has never been properly proven, but was suspected to have been caused by a cigarette. Rescue workers bring the bodies of victims of the circus blaze into an emergency morgue set up in the Hartford, Connecticut armory on July 6, 1944 .

Police inspect one of the wild animal runways of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey Circus . Several years after the tragedy, while being investigated on other arson charges, Robert Dale Segeewho, who was an adolescent at the time, confessed to starting the blaze, but was never tried  and later recanted his confession. John B. Stewart, the former Hartford fire chief, was 14 years old at the time of the fire. He remembers being outside the tent when it erupted.

"A 19-year-old suburban Denver woman who tried to go to Syria to help Islamic State militants has been sentenced to four years in prison. Shannon Conley, who received military training when she went to a camp run by the US Army Explorers, learned her punishment in Denver federal court on Friday as her parents watched. Wearing a black and tan headscarf with her jail uniform, she tearfully told the judge that she has disavowed jihad and that the people who influenced her misconstrued the Quran. Conley pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization in September under a deal that requires her to divulge information she may have about other Americans with similar intentions. Scroll down for video . Behind bars: Shannon Conley, 19, from Denver, has been sentenced to four years in prisons for trying to flee to Syria and join Islamic Militants. She is pictured during her time at U.S. Army Explorers Camp . Precautions: A U.S. Homeland Security officer takes a sniffer dog around the federal courthouse in Denver ahead of Conley's sentencing . FBI agents say Conley wanted to marry a suitor she met online who told her he was fighting with the extremists. She repeatedly told them she wanted to fight alongside him or use her skills as a nurse's aide to help. Judge Raymond Moore said the sentence was meant to deter others with similar intentions. Earlier in the hearing he expressed doubt that Conley had disavowed jihad, pointing to a letter she wrote to a friend from jail in which she ridiculed other inmates for denouncing terrorism. He also said Conley has a history of defiance that has played out in the case and that she needs mental help. Happier times: Shannon, pictured in a circle, with her mother (bottom center) and three older sisters in 2012 before her conversion to Islam . Security: Two Homeland Security stand in front of a patrol car and news channel trucks ahead of the hearing . Heads down: Ana and John Conley, parents of Shannon Conley, exit the U.S. Federal courthouse following their daughter's plea hearing on Wednesday, September 10 . 'Defiance has been a part of her fabric for a long time. She has been defiant before this,' the judge said. 'This is not the exceptional act. This is Shannon being defiant yet again.' Conley could have faced up to five years in federal prison after pleading guilty to trying to help Islamic State militants, but her sentence depended at least in part on how helpful she was to authorities still investigating her case and others like it. Authorities became aware of Conley's growing interest in extremism in November 2013 after she started talking about terrorism with employees of a suburban Denver church. They had seen her wandering around and taking notes on the layout of the campus, according to court documents. FBI agents met repeatedly with Conley starting in late 2013 hoping to dissuade her from leaving, suggesting she pursue humanitarian work instead. But she told them she was intent on waging jihad in the Middle East, even though she knew it was illegal, according to court documents. She believed it was her only answer to correcting what she saw as wrongs perpetrated against the Muslim world. Beliefs: Conley (pictured on the right, with a friend) tried out several different religions in college before selecting Islam .","Shannon Conley, 19, from Denver, was handed the term in federal court .

"Lugging kit around and dealing with upset neighbours is part of many drummer's lives. Now a team of British inventors claims to have created a solution to these problems by designing an 'invisible' drum kit. Dubbed AeroDrums, the gadget uses real-time motion-tracking technology to make the musician sound as if they are playing the real thing. Scroll down for video . Dubbed AeroDrums, the gadget uses real-time motion-tracking technology to make the musician sound as if they are playing the real thing. 'My neighbours can't hear me drum,' said inventor Richard Lee (pictured) 'I had to stop drumming when I went to college because of noise and lack of space,' said Richard Lee, co-inventor of the system. 'Now I can carry Aerodrums in my shoulder bag and my neighbours can't hear me drum when I wear headphones.'

"A man who was found stabbed to death alongside his partner in their Queensland home, where a five-year-old boy was found unharmed, was a convicted paedophile who served two jail terms. Corey Croft, 43, spent almost seven years behind bars for child sex offences that he committed in both South Australia and Queensland, including an incident in which he had sex with a five-year-old while recording the crime, the Gold Coast Bulletin reports. He and his partner, Renee Carter, 39, were found dead in their Upper Coomera home on the Gold Coast on Wednesday. Ms Carter's five-year-old son was found wandering the family home on Skylark Street just after 5.30pm by his aunt who located the two bodies, and is believed to have been inside the house for an entire day before the gruesome discovery. Corey Croft, 43, who was allegedly murdered in his Upper Coomera home on Tuesday, was a convicted paedophile who served two jail terms. In 1995 he was imprisoned for having sex with a five-year-old while recording the crime . The 43-year-old and Renee Carter were found dead inside the family home at Upper Coomera on the Gold Coast just after 5.30pm on Wednesday . Ms Carter's ex-husband Christopher Robert Carter, an Afghanistan war veteran and the father of a number of the deceased woman's children, has been charged with murdering the pair. Christopher Robert Carter, depicted in this court sketch, has been charged with murdering his ex-wife Renee Carter, 39, and her partner Corey Croft, 43 . Superintendent David Hutchinson told the Gold Coast Bulletin that Croft, formerly known as Corey Krawtschenko, had changed his name following his convictions. However, he said investigators had ruled out that his former offences where the motive behind his alleged murder. Croft first served four and a half years in prison after videotaping himself sexually assaulting a five-year-old child in 1995. He moved to Queensland after his release, where in 2007 he was sentenced to another year and four months behind bars for possessing child pornography. The revelation of Croft's former offences has led advocacy groups to protest against the legal loopholes that allow sex offenders to change their names and essentially hide their past. It comes as the five-year-old boy, who was found unharmed and wondering the same house in which Croft and his mother had been killed, was revealed to have no comprehension that he will see his parents again. 'Mummy and Daddy are dead and there's blood everywhere,' the child told his neighbours, Nepia and Megan Kino, according to The Courier Mail. 'I'm going to take them to hospital to fix their cuts so they can get better. Mr Carter's son, a five-year-old boy who was also the son of Ms Carter, was found unharmed and wandering the home he shared with the victims. Police say the house will remain a crime scene for at least a week . Mr Carter is a member of the Australian Defence Force and has served on at least one tour of Afghanistan . Police believe the boy was asleep at the time and are confident he did not witness the deaths. He did however spend the following day in the home with his parents' bodies . Police believe the victims were stabbed to death in the home at around 8pm on Tuesday evening. Carter briefly appeared at Southport Magistrates Court on Thursday but didn't speak or show any emotion. He had been divorced from the mother of the five-year-old boy  for seven years. Regional crime co-ordinator Detective Superintendent David Hutchinson said a knife was used in the double murder of Ms Carter and Mr Croft and that the woman's sister found the pair when she visited the house after being unable to make contact. Police believe the boy was asleep at the time and are confident he did not witness the deaths. He did however spend the following day in the home with his parents' bodies. Detective examine a knife outside the Upper Coomera home where the man and woman were found dead . Police are now searching another premises for possible bloodied clothing and have appealed for anyone who saw a white 1999 model Mitsubishi Pajero four-wheel drive in the area over the last week to come forward . Detective searched another premises for possible bloodied clothing and a public toilet block near the accused's home. They have appealed for anyone who saw a white 1999 model Mitsubishi Pajero four-wheel drive in the area over the last week to come forward. Following the gruesome discovery, the boy was consoled outside his home by a detective   dressed in a blue forensic suit, believed to be used when someone may have evidence on their body, the Gold Coast Bulletin reports. Supt. Hutchinson said the boy was not involved in the fatal incident and was unharmed. He is being cared for by relatives after speaking with police. 'You would understand that a five-year-old child being inside the house under those circumstances would have to be very traumatic,' Supt Hutchinson said. 'You've just got to hope at the end of the day that he's young enough to minimise the impact on him.' Police set up an extensive crime scene in Skylark Street, Upper Coomera, and are now seeking wotnesses who saw a white Mitsubishi Pajero in the area over the last week . Police confirmed a little boy with blonde hair was found alone in the house by his aunt who located the bodies of her sister and brother-in-law and hinted that the boy may have witnessed the alleged murders . A neighbour said he heard arguing coming from the family home on Tuesday night but it stopped when he went to investigate. It's believed the family signed a lease on the home six months ago. Tony Smales, another neighbour, told the Gold Coast Bulletin the household was the most family-orientated on the street. 'They had the entire place lit up for Christmas with giant Santas and reindeer, so it just blows you away to see something like this happen,' he said. Carter made no application for bail and has been remanded in custody. The matter has been adjourned until March 27. Police say a knife was used to murder the 39-year-old woman and 43-year-old man . Police 36-year-old Chrsitopher Robert Carter of Upper Coomera had been charged with two counts of murder and that one of his two alleged victims was his former wife . The bodies were found at property in Upper Coomera on the Gold Coast just after 5.30pm on Wednesday .

"Islamic State has published a list of punishments ranging from 80 lashes for drinking alcohol and losing a hand for theft, to death for committing blasphemy. The Sharia code of conduct will be enforced in areas under its control which now covers large swathes of Iraq and Syria. Those who commit adultery will be stoned to death if the adulterer was married and lashed 100 times and exiled if he or she was unmarried. Scroll down for video . Executions: The UN human rights office has condemned numerous executions of civilians in the country by Islamic State . Those engaged in sodomy (homosexuality) will be sentenced to death, along with those who 'spy for the unbelievers'. Those who steal 'as part of banditry' will have their right hand and left leg cut off, and the punishment for terrorising people is exile. Charlie Winter, a researcher for the counter-extremism think tank Quilliam, said the document appeared to be authentic. He told The Independent it was released on 16 December from the Aleppo branch of Isis. Last week, ISIS published pictures of the crucifixions of two men accused of being bandits, and of a woman being stoned to death, allegedly for adultery. The terrorist group also released a video showing the two men being thrown off the top of a tower block in Raqqa, Syria, for being gay. A masked Islamic State fighter announced the charges against the accused using a small handheld radio, before declaring them guilty of engaging in homosexual activities. He said they should be punished by death, in accordance with Islamic State's radical interpretation of Sharia law. The men were then bound and blindfolded before being pushed off the 100ft tower block to their deaths. Shocking: ISIS militants bound and blindfolded men before throwing them off the top of a 100ft tower block for 'homosexual crimes' Back on the ground, men accused of banditry hung from the crosses in agony as their wrists were tightly bound with yellow and green ribbon . Down on the ground, two men accused of banditry have been tied to makeshift metal crosses. Strung up tightly with yellow and green ribbon around their wrists, the men were hanged from the crosses, wincing in agony’. And it's believed the ISIS militants killed three of at least 15 pigeon breeders in Iraq after deciding it is against Islamic religion to keep birds this week. The extremists also executed 13 teenage boys for watching the Asian Cup football match between Iraq and Jordan last week. The young football fans had been caught watching the game on television in the Iraqi city of Mosul, which is controlled by the Islamic State. The final images show a burqa-clad woman being read her charges for adultery before she is stoned to death . The teenagers were rounded up and publicly executed by a firing squad using machine guns, according to anti-ISIS activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently. The small activist group said the teenagers were rounded up by militants in the Al-Yarmouk district of Mosul after 'breaking religious laws' by watching football. Images also emerged of a woman, dressed in a black burqa, being stoned to death by a horde of ISIS militants. Four doctors were recently killed in central Mosul, allegedly after refusing to treat ISIS fighters. The group also reportedly executed 15 civilians in front of a large crowd in Fallujah on January 1, on suspicion they had cooperated with Iraqi security forces, and 14 more in a public square in Dour, north of Tikrit, for refusing to pledge allegiance to ISIS, Shamdasani said.","Code of conduct will be enforced in areas under its control .

"In the lead up to the nation's hottest month, two huge red bellied black snakes have been captured in an intricate act of aggression in one of Sydney's most popular parks. The snakes were shown writhing in a corkscrew motion at the popular Lake Parramatta reserve, in Sydney's Western suburbs. The reserve was officially opened this week for swimming, causing some to worry about the dangers of snakes in the area ahead of what is anticipated to be a busy weekend. Two huge red bellied black snakes have been captured in an intricate act of aggression in one of Sydney's most popular parks . The video was shot by Carmen Bennett, a North Parramatta local, who said that she shared the footage, taken in September, to illustrate that the area was home to many of the red bellied residents. 'I want people to enjoy their time at Lake Parramatta, but I also want them to stay safe and be aware of the red-bellied black snakes which are in their natural habitats, so there’s no warning signs to say what to do if you’re bit by them,' Ms Bennett told The Daily Telegraph. 'It’s (the video is) to say, look come and really enjoy the lake and the wildlife and reserve, but please be aware of the dangers of the snakes and also the dangers of swimming in the lake,' she said. The 60 hectare bush and parkland reserve is a popular destination for families and nature enthusiasts alike, and has at least 12 species of reptiles within it's borders. The red bellied black snake, while one of the two most common snakes in Western Sydney, is not as dangerous as it's exterior might indicate. The snakes were shown writhing in a corkscrew motion at the popular Lake Parramatta reserve, in Sydney's Western suburbs . Red bellied black snakes can grow up to six foot long and are extremely common to the area . Raymond 'Snakeman' Hoser, a reptile expert based in Melbourne, said that red bellied black snakes can grow up to six foot long and are extremely common to the area. 'The snakes are fighting in a corkscrew position. What would normally happen is that they would be fighting over females, but sometimes they fight just when they come up to one another,' said Raymond. 'The peak mating season would be from August until November, which explains this behaviour, but they are still very common during this time of the year and will be moving around,' he said. Raymond, of snake and reptile show Snakebusters, said that red bellied black snakes are not likely to bite, and are actually one of the most docile species in the country. 'I've caught thousands of them, and they just don't bite. They are very fast, and will run away, but even if you catch them they most likely won't have a go at you,' he said. Raymond, of snake and reptile show Snakebusters, said that red bellied black snakes are not likely to bite, and are actually one of the most docile species in the country . Raymond said that he would warn people do not 'muck with' snakes, and to either walk away if they see one or simply observe it . 'However if people do get bitten it's often because they've been interfering with the snake.' Raymond said that he would warn people do not 'muck with' snakes, and to either walk away if they see one or simply observe it. 'Sydney is very urbanised, so the likelihood of seeing one of them isn't high, and if you do, just step back and admire it,' he said. 'Scaremongering and snakes go together, but unless you're really interfering with them, they're very casual.' One of the more significant problems tends to be with domesticated pets being bitten by snakes. The Parramatta Lake Reserve will open officially for swimming at 10am on Saturday, and lifeguards will be patrolling the area from 9am to 5pm on weekends until March . The 60 hectare bush and parkland reserve is a popular destination for families and nature enthusiasts alike, and has at least 12 species of reptiles within it's borders . Australia Lifeguard Service manager Brett Manieri warned members of the public who were anticipating swimming in the reserve to swim between the buoys . 'Contrary to popular belief, most people are sensible, they'll walk away when they see a snake. Dogs and cats on the other hand are at higher risk because they see an animal and they want to kill it,' Raymond said. He said there would be an average of ten to 20 snake bites every day in Sydney, incidents which cost an average of $8000 to treat because of how expensive the anti-venom is. 'If you live in an area where there is bush, keep your yard clean and presentable,' Raymond advised.

"Tourists will no longer have to hold their breath when they visit the loo at certain attractions in China as the country promises a ‘toilet revolution’ to improve standards. Western holidaymakers are often befuddled or disgusted when they first encounter a row of squat toilets on the floor, often with little separation or privacy. And with some facilities lacking or in awful shape, China’s tourism bosses have announced a three-year plan to install more than 33,000 sparkling new toilets at tourist sites and renovate a further 25,000 across the country. Western holidaymakers are often befuddled or disgusted when they first encounter a row of squat toilets . Li Jinzao, chairman of China’s National Tourism Administration, said toilets at sites and restaurants frequented by visitors will be cleaner and will meet the country’s three-star standard. He said the plan will see 13,000 new toilets installed in 2015. China’s Xinhua state news agency said the move follows the government’s acknowledgement that there aren’t enough toilets in tourist areas, some are still ‘dirty and chaotic’, and better management is needed. China plans to install more than 33,000 new toilets at tourist sites and renovate a further 25,000 . Increasing the number – and quality – of toilets is part of China’s ongoing efforts to grow its tourism industry and improve public infrastructure. Traditional water closets in China are squat toilets – holes in the ground or trenches where people do their business while squat elbow-to-elbow. People are required to bring their own toilet paper, and eye contact and conversation are best avoided. It is a primitive concept to Westerners who sit on porcelain thrones in privacy, although ‘Western-style’ sit-down toilets are common in China's tourist hotels.","China plans to install 33,000 new toilets and renovate a further 25,000 .

"She was the blonde event sales manager at a football club who jokingly posed with the slogan ‘sex bomb’. He was the team’s strapping star striker and captain. But when rumours of a fling between Joanne Clay and Marc Richards began to circulate, the club decided there could be only one result. Despite denying they had an affair, Miss Clay was sacked by League One side Port Vale. Richards faced no action, even though she claimed he had tried to seduce her. 'Too attractive': Joanne Clay said that when then Port Vale chief executive Perry Deakin questioned her about the rumours of an affair with Richards, he told her: ‘Your problem is that you are too attractive to work in football' Miss Clay, 33, said the club had a strict rule that female staff must not have relationships with players and she was told by bosses she was ‘too attractive to work in football’. Now she is in line for a payout of tens of thousands of pounds after winning her sex discrimination case against the club and a claim for sexual harassment. The employment tribunal ruled it was ‘striking’ that while she was suspended, investigated and then dismissed over the rumours, ‘no action whatsoever was taken’ against the player. It also found that the Stoke-on-Trent club’s ban on relationships between employees and footballers was ‘a rule that is slanted against women’. Miss Clay said Richards, 32, had pursued her after she joined the club in May 2011 but she had rejected his advances. The father-of-three, who has a long-term girlfriend, left repeated messages on her phone and on social media, wrote his phone number in dirt on her car, followed her to the bank and later visited her at home after persuading her to give him her address, she told the tribunal. Miss Clay, a mother-of-five who was married at the time, said she was the target of frequent crude sexual comments by the club’s sales manager Chris Bedding. He called her a ‘bitch’, teased her about her rumoured affair with Richards, pestered her to date him and demanded that she wear low-cut tops, she said. After she was sacked in October 2011, Mr Bedding asked a colleague to get photographs from the team that he claimed showed her having sex with Richards, the tribunal heard. Miss Clay claimed that at one work dinner Mr Bedding told a waitress to announce her as ‘Joanne Richards’. Star striker: Despite denying they had an affair, Miss Clay was sacked by League One side Port Vale. Richards faced no action, even though she claimed he had tried to seduce her . She said that Mr Bedding had numerous sexual relationships with barmaids and waitresses at the club, but no disciplinary action resulted. Mr Bedding, who has since left the club, denied this – but an unnamed female sales executive said that he made ‘disgusting’ sexual comments both to her and to Miss Clay. Miss Clay, who is pictured on Facebook holding signs saying ‘sex bomb’ and ‘no chance’ at a hen party, said that when then Port Vale chief executive Perry Deakin questioned her about the rumours of an affair with Richards, he told her: ‘Your problem is that you are too attractive to work in football.’ The tribunal accepted Mr Deakin’s denial that he made the comment. But it found Port Vale and Azure Support Services Ltd, the company through which Miss Clay was employed, guilty of sex discrimination in relation to her dismissal and her harassment by Mr Bedding. The panel said a man would not have been treated in the same way. Miss Clay’s compensation will be set at hearing in March. Richards, who played for Port Vale between 2007 and 2012, is now with Northampton Town. He lives with his partner of 12 years, Melanie Gaye, 31, and their three children. Miss Clay, from Stoke-on-Trent, is believed to have divorced her husband James Vernon, 35 – a coach for local rivals Stoke City – last year. She lives with a new partner and runs a wedding planning and bridal wear business in Newcastle-under-Lyme. She did not wish to comment further.

"The parents of a college student who was shot to death 10 years ago are finally breaking their silence and revealing that they believe a SWAT team killed their daughter. Jim and Susan Positano's daughter Sarah was just a few months shy of graduating from Kent State University in Kent, Ohio when she was taken captive in her apartment by James Earl Trimble. Trimble eventually agreed to free the 22-year-old after speaking with a hostage negotiator, yet  the Positanos claim that just seconds later their daughter was dead after a 'rogue' SWAT team member entered the apartment and startled Trimble, resulting in him dropping his his gun which went off and killed Sarah. Sarah Positano (right, with friend) was killed 10 years ago after being held captive in her apartment . Now her parents are opening up saying she was shot after a 'rogue' SWAT team member tried to take out her captor, startling him so much he dropped his gun which went off and killed their daughter . 'Did Sarah have to die? That’s the question that’s been in my head for all these years,' Jim told the Akron Beacon Journal. Jim and his wife have thought about speaking out for years they revealed, and telling everyone how the 'cowboy-like' actions of this one person ended their daughter's life, but have waited until now, 10 years alter. 'I lost the most precious thing to me,' said Jim, 'and I can’t begin to tell you how anyone would get through something like this.' In 2007 the couple did file a $150million wrongful death suit against the township, former Police Chief David Oliver and the Metro SWAT team, but in 2009 it was thrown out by Common Pleas Judge John Enlow in 2009 in a summary judgment order. Susan believes that Oliver, along with Portage County Prosecutor Victor V. Vigluicci and Enlow, were 'all in bed together.' Jim added that he and his wife 'spent a lot of time trying to develop a case that hasn’t worked, and we don’t expect it’s going to work because I don’t think you’re going to beat the government. The government there is controlling the police.' Trimble was high on crystal meth the night he took Sarah hostage, having been firing hundreds of shots at cops as he made his way through the woods in the are after murdering his girlfriend, Renee Bauer, 42, and her son, Dakota, 7, on Jan. 21, 2005. After speaking with a hostage negotiation a little before midnight he finally agreed to Sarah's release. James Earl Trimble (above), the man who killed Sarah, was high on crystal meth and had just murdered his girlfriend and her son . 'He said: ""Give me a couple of hours to get my s--- together, and I’ll let her go,""' said Mike Korach of the New Franklin Police Department in his testimony during Trimble's murder trial. Just moments later, Sarah was dead from a single gunshot wound to her neck. Trimble has maintained that he was holding his gin and dropped in when the 'rogue' sniper appeared from off the patio and took a shot at him - and even Positano's parents agree with this version of events. 'Trimble dropped the gun, it went off and killed Sarah. He was going for a rifle he had,' said Jim. And ballistics seem to back up that a second bullet was indeed fired at Trimble, though it missed. In fact, at one point, claims Jim, they even found a cop willing to go on record and admit what really happened - and confirm their version of events. 'I had my investigator go and speak with him. He knew there was a guy in there. He knew everything. He said straight out: ""I can prove it."" But he was too afraid for his family to stand up in court,' said Jim.Now, it isn't about the money or even justice as much as just knowing what happened to their daughter in those final minutes of her life. 'There must be people out there who want to say something, but they’re afraid to,' said Jim. 'Maybe now that the pressure’s off someone will come forward.' Cops had previously argued that what Trimble saw was a grill on the deck, a claim they backed up by pointing out he had fired eight rounds into  it. More than other drugs, the use of meth does leave some seeing things that are not really there or confusing inanimate objects for people.","Sarah Positano was just a few months shy of graduating from Kent State University in Kent, Ohio in 2005 when she was taken hostage .

"A teacher has been suspended after he went on a rant in support of two female colleagues suspended for allegedly having sex with male students at a beach party. Sean Patrick Kane, who teaches art at South Hills High School in West Covina, California, was placed on paid leave on Thursday. In a lengthy message on his Facebook page, Kane wrote a message directed at the teen victims of the teachers, saying: 'You should have just kept your stupid mouths shut and enjoyed it.' Scroll down for video . Art teacher Sean Patrick Kane was suspended from South Hills High School in West Covina, California after ranting on Facebook in defense of his colleagues . He went on: 'All I want to know is what the f*** is in the heads of the dudes who banged these ladies and then squealed?... Everybody has lost their f****** minds.' A school district spokeswoman confirmed to NBC that Kane had been placed on leave, adding: 'We would expect teachers to be professional.' The latest debacle comes after four teaching staff were arrested or facing lawsuits at the school. Two female teachers were arrested last Saturday for engaging in sexual encounters on the beach with male students, police said. Melody Lippert, 38, met up with the boys from South Hills High at a beach in San Clemente  in November 2014. South Hills High School teacher Melody Lippert, 38, (pictured left) and teacher Michelle Ghirelli, 30, allegedly had sex with a group of male students on an Orange County beach . Lippert reportedly gave the group alcohol and then engaged in a sexual act with one of the students. During a second liaison, Lippert brought along 30-year-old teacher Michelle Ghirelli. The high school's wrestling coach, Anthony Vidales, 29, was arrested for alleged sex with a girl, 17 . The two spent the night on a beach with a group of boys during which they had sex with two students, police said. Police were tipped off and Lippert was charged with conspiracy and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Ghirelli was charged with copulation and unlawful sex with a minor, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Department. Both women were placed on paid leave. The school district gave no comment other than to say the encounters did not take place during events sponsored by the school or district. On January 7, a part-time wrestling coach at South Hills High was arrested for allegedly having sex with a 17-year-old girl on the team . Anthony Vidales, 29, who does not teach in the district, was placed on paid leave. He posted $20,000 bail. The investigation continues. A second wrestling coach, Scott McDonald Stragier, was named in a lawsuit by a former student, Joseph Leyba Jr, who alleged that the staff member choked and berated him in front of students during a March 14 incident.","Sean Patrick Kane, who teaches art at South Hills High School in West Covina, California, was placed on paid leave on Thursday .

With its sugar-sand beaches and gently swaying palms, it's no surprise that the Caribbean has proved a hit with holidaying royalty. A particular favourite is St Barts, which earlier this year saw Princess Beatrice arrive on its shores for a break. Part of the Leeward Islands, the island is one of four that make up the French West Indies, and is home to popular celebrity haunts such as Maya's, a beachside restaurant just outside the capital Gustavia. ‘The Caribbean island of St Barts is synonymous with the rich and famous, from Beyonce and Jay-Z to Roman Abramovich,' says MailOnline acting travel editor, Sarah Gordon. Home: Another royal to love the island was Princess Margaret who owned a home there . While celebrities are certainly seen here, it is the ultra-wealthy media moguls and steel magnates who really love to splash out on holidays in this exclusive spot. ‘All of that makes it perfect for the royals, who can enjoy the island’s relative privacy and lack of “riff raff” – the island can be difficult and pricy to reach, ensuring most holidaymakers head elsewhere.' Almost as popular with the royal set is the exclusive island of Mustique, which in January last year, was the scene of Prince George's first ever trip abroad. While the little prince stayed in a rented villa with his Middleton relatives and will do so again this year, his great aunt Princess Margaret, another royal fond of a Mustique break, sunned in style in the garden of the villa she owned on the island. Although he is not yet two, Prince George has already travelled to Australia and New Zealand on tour, and taken several private jets to Scotland. He also flew to Mustique last year without his father, who was studying at Cambridge University. This year Prince William is meant to be revising for exams to become an air ambulance pilot but seems to have taken some time out. Famed for its pristine beaches and upmarket watering holes, the island is one of the most exclusive destinations in the world. It became famous in the 1960s when its owner, Lord Glenconner, gave Princess Margaret a ten-acre plot of land as a wedding present. Paparazzi are banned – making Mustique a magnet for celebrities including Mick Jagger and David Bowie.","The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have jetted off to Mustique .

"More than $300,000 in world-class wine stolen from Napa Valley restaurant French Laundry has been recovered from a private cellar in North Carolina. The wine was stolen on Christmas night from the eatery in California, which is rated three stars in the Michelin guide and has twice been named the best in the world by Restaurant Magazine. The batch included $10,000 bottles of Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, which have built-in laser and digital technology on its corks and capsules to curb counterfeiting and theft. Napa County sheriff's Capt Doug Pike says it's unclear how the 76 bottles of mainly rare French wine ended up in Greensboro, North Carolina, the Santa Rosa Press Democrat reported. Scroll down for video . World class: More than $300,000 of world-class wine stolen from the famed Napa Valley, California, restaurant has been found in a private cellar in North Carolina a month after the theft on Christmas night . No arrests have been made. Officials from the Greensboro Police Department were not immediately available for comment on Friday. An online wine list shows the bottles sell for $3,250 to $7,950 at the restaurant. Screaming Eagle wines, one of the most highly sought-after American wines, were also stolen. On Monday, after a nearly monthlong investigation, analysis of forensic evidence, and numerous interviews, Napa County Sheriff's detectives traveled to Greensboro to recover the majority of the wines stolen from the restaurant. The investigation is ongoing. The sheriff's office will be working with state and federal law enforcement authorities to following up on leads developed in case, Pike said. He declined further comment. Mystery: Detectives said they currently have no idea how the haul was transported 3,000 miles to Greensboro . The theft occurred on Christmas evening or night at Chef Thomas Keller's famed restaurant, which is known for twice daily serving nine-course tasting menus, none of which uses the same ingredient more than once. In 2003 and 2004, the French Laundry was named best restaurant in the world by Restaurant Magazine. The restaurant had closed one day earlier for a six-month kitchen remodel.","The wine was stolen from French Laundry in Napa Valley on Christmas .

"An enforcer for hate preacher Anjem Choudary yesterday admitted joining a ‘Muslim Patrol’ which threatened to enforce sharia law. Jordan Horner, 19, was a leading member of a vigilante mob that roamed London’s East End attacking non-Muslims in a campaign against Western culture. The gang threatened to ‘kill non-believers’ and ‘shank’ or stab them and uploaded videos to YouTube criticising people’s appearance. Scroll down for video . Accused: Jordan Horner, left, and Ricardo McFarlane, right, were said to be members of the 'Muslim Patrol' The ginger-haired convert, who uses the name Jamaal Uddin, admitted assaulting two men during one confrontation. During a hearing at the Old Bailey, he . also pleaded guilty to two public order offences via video link from . high security Belmarsh Prison. Horner is a close associate of Choudary and was arrested outside his home earlier this year for assaulting a photographer. The outspoken thug has boasted that one of his heroes is Osama bin Laden and said British soldiers will burn in hell. He was held as part of a highly . sensitive Met investigation into the self-titled Muslim Patrol, that . operated in the Tower Hamlets area of East London. The intimidating mob . was seen walking the streets in the early hours of the morning last . December and January. Radical: Horner, 19, is close to jihadist hate preacher Anjem Choudary, pictured during a demonstration . One morning, Horner and others . snatched cans of beers from a group of five men before emptying them in . the gutter. They shouted: ‘Why are you poisoning your body? It is . against Islam. This is Muslim Patrol. Kill the non believers.’ One then told another to ‘go get the . shank’, meaning a knife, but as the men started to walk away, Horner . threw several punches, hitting one on the jaw. At an earlier hearing a . prosecutor said: ‘The victims describe the main aggressor as being . ginger with a ginger beard.’ Horner also admitted threatening two couples and a man in the capital in December and January. The ‘Muslim Patrol’ sparked huge . controversy when it posted a series of videos on YouTube, including one . called ‘The Truth About Saturday Night’. In them they confronted members . of the public, demanding they give up alcohol and that women cover . themselves in a ‘Muslim area’. The hooded men filmed themselves calling . white women ‘naked animals with no self-respect’ and labelled alcohol . ‘evil’ as they stole it from revellers. In one bizarre exchange they filmed an . injured cyclist being treated after a road accident and claimed he was . hurt because he was unclean. One said, ‘We don’t care if you are . appalled at all,’ before calling themselves ‘vigilantes implementing . Islam upon your own necks.’ Threats: Horner told a photographer he could end up like murdered soldier Lee Rigby, pictured . In another clip, the group protested . against adverts for push-up bras by High Street retailer H&M, . pouring petrol over one and setting it alight. They said: ‘The Muslims have taken it upon themselves to command the good and forbid the evil and cover up these naked people.’ Horner was a troubled youth who became an enforcer for Choudary when he converted to Islam after being approached outside a pub. He has said: ‘People need to realise . sharia law is coming. What better person to spread the message than one . whose life was once so corrupted?’ In July, he was jailed for six weeks . for beating up a photographer and causing £3,000 of damage to a car in . an attack outside Choudary’s home. Horner told his victim that he could . be killed like soldier Lee Rigby, who was almost decapitated outside his . barracks in Woolwich, South-East London. The photographer said Horner . shouted ‘you’re scum, brother’, adding: ‘You should be careful. What . happened to the boy soldier could happen to you.’ Horner, of Walthamstow, East London, . appeared at the Old Bailey alongside Ricardo McFarlane and a 23-year-old . man who cannot be named for legal reasons.

"The pub owner who beat Gordon Ramsay in a multi-million pound High Court battle has told how the celebrity chef ruined his life. Gary Love has spoken out for the first time after defeating the celebrity chef in a case which centred on Ramsay's claim that his estranged father-in-law Chris Hutcheson had effectively forged his signature to commit him to a 25-year contract for a London gastropub. But Mr Justice Morgan poured scorn on Ramsay's claim that he had been duped over the use of a signature making machine to sign the agreement, calling his evidence 'entirely implausible' and leaving him facing a £10million rent bill. Scroll down for video . Gordon Ramsay (pictured with wife Tana) lost a £10million court case this week when a judge rejected claims he had been duped over the agreement to guarantee a gastropub’s £640,000 annual rent . Mr Love owned the York and Albany pub, near Regent's Park, when Hutcheson committed Ramsay to personally guarantee the £640,000 a year lease on the premises in 2007. But in 2010 Ramsay sacked Hutcheson, who was chief executive of his companies, claiming he had been secretly siphoning off money from the business and subsequently lodged action against Love. Mr Love said: 'It completely destroyed my life and my family's life. Everything was put on hold. 'He made my life a nightmare with an entirely spurious claim in an attempt to wriggle out of a loss making business, whereas if he had just asked me I could have done what he does on the TV with Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares. Gary Love, the owner of the pub, has now criticised the chef for bringing the lengthy court case . 'I could very easily tell him why his business is losing £4million a year.' The court heard that Ramsay had lined up the property for his star chef Angela Hartnett and before the agreement was signed he had met up with Love to discuss the deal. The film director said that Ramsay had ruined his business and family life, not least because he had put a legal 'notice' against the York and Albany property to alert potential buyers that there was a legal battle surrounding ownership of the property. He said: 'My family and I had arranged to sell up in the UK as we were moving to LA to pursue opportunities. 'We needed to sell the property to provide working capital for my new projects in LA but the notice Ramsay had placed on it meant we couldn't do that. 'The children were already booked into schools in California. I couldn't not go there so we had to go and launch a business without funds. It was a nightmare.' The court heard that Hutcheson, who knew that Love would sue him if Ramsay won in court, initially helped Love prepare his case against before the pair subsequently fell out. Since Ramsay parted ways with Hutcheson, the pair have been at loggerheads in and out of court with the chef saying he felt like a 'performing monkey' and his wife Tana accusing her father of a 'distressing fraud' in the High Court. The High Court had heard that Hutcheson used a 'ghost writer' machine to put Ramsay's signature on a series of contracts but the celebrity chef claimed he did not have his consent to do this. But Ramsay's secretary Jennifer Aves-Elliott revealed that, after Hutcheson had been fired in 2010, she had told Gordon and Tana Ramsay about her concerns about the use of the ghost writing machine. The judge noted  that Ramsay had never mentioned this when he had subsequently taken legal action against Hutcheson the following year despite the apparent significance of this. In his judgement Mr Justice Morgan said: 'Mr Ramsay knew, long before the entry into the agreement for lease and the lease of the premises, that the machine was routinely used to place his signature on legal documents.' The dispute was over the York & Albany, where Ramsay opened a restaurant near Regent’s Park in London . The judge added: 'I do not accept his evidence to the contrary. I find that when Mr Hutcheson committed Mr Ramsay to the guarantee in the lease of the premises, Mr Hutcheson was acting within the wide general authority conferred on him by Mr Ramsay at all times until Mr Hutcheson's dismissal in October 2010. 'Mr Ramsay may now regret the transaction in relation to the premises. He may particularly regret his involvement as a guarantor. He may consider that Mr Hutcheson did a bad deal. Ramsay claimed his estranged father-in-law Chris Hutcheson had effectively forged his signature to commit him to a 25-year contract at the gastropub . 'However, on any finding, he is not able to say that Mr Hutcheson exceeded his authority in any respect. Mr Ramsay - acting through his agent Mr Hutcheson - is bound by the guarantee in the lease of the premises.' Mr Love said of learning about the victory: 'My 50th birthday occurred during the middle of the trial. My wife had booked a special surprise family celebration for me in a secret location at Big Sur. I had to miss it. We are planning something else now, and that also will be a surprise.' Ramsay is now facing estimated court costs alone of £1.6million and was also told this week that his legal team had been refused permission to appeal. The celebrity chef's restaurant empire fell £6.4million into the red last June, driven by one-off costs of £9million, with £6.7million relating to the York & Albany lease and £2million in legal expenses. Of Ramsay, Mr Love added: 'I think he was very badly advised, and I hope that both of our families can now put this behind us and get on with our lives. If he rings me up, I will tell him what he needs to do to run the restaurant at a profit. 'My solicitor Philip Cohen's work cracked the case. On the face of it, Ramsay had an open and shut case of his signature being forged on an important legal document. 'It was through Philip's relentless work in dragging out other documents of Ramsay that we were able to show that the signature on the personal guarantee was not a one-off.' Mr Cohen, of Jeffrey Green Russell, said: 'I think people in public positions like Ramsay should set a better example. What is so worrying is that Ramsay could have got away with it.'","Pub owner hits out at TV chef after winning long-running court case .

"A fast-moving coastal storm is forecast to blast several major cities in the Northeast with a mix of snow, sleet and rain on Saturday all along the busy I-95 corridor. The biggest snowfall amounts are expected in southern New England, but forecasters warned that temperatures hovering near freezing could make for slippery driving conditions across the region. The approaching storm is also likely to plummet in pressure, leading to strong winds which will drive the snow and sleet. If the drop in pressure equals of exceeds 24milibars within 24 hours the storm will then meet the technical definition for a weather bomb - in a process known as bombogenesis. Scroll down for video . Incoming: This forecast from the Weather Channel predicts a maximum of five inches of snow in New York City, with parts of New England facing a potential eight inches . First flakes: This picture, from Leesburg, Virginia, shows the first traces of snowfall . Snowfall: Gaithersburg, Maryland (above), had also started to see frosty downpours . 'It's kind of the first one, so it's a good thing it's happening this weekend,' National Weather Service meteorologist Bill Simpson in Taunton, Massachusetts, said Friday. 'If this happened during a weekday, it could be really slow and messy.' According to the Weather Channel, sleet and snow will begin to hit Washington, D.C., and southern Pennsylvania on Friday night. By Saturday morning, a mixture of sleet and snow is expected to be falling in all major cities from D.C. as high as Portland, Maine - including New York City. As the day warms up slightly, some places could see snow in the morning, sleet in the daytime, then snow in the evening again. The fiercest snow is predicted for Rhode Island, Maine and the Massachusetts coast around Boston. A winter storm warning was issued Friday for a large portion of central Pennsylvania ahead of the storm. It begins: Friday night is set to bring widespread up to the Mason Dixon line, after which sleet and snow will fall . Colder: Snow on Saturday is set to be more widespread, with a long sweep of inland areas in the firing line . Forecasters said the area from Gettysburg to Johnstown, stretching from West Virginia through Maryland to just south of State College and Williamsport, could get 5 to 8 inches of snow between Friday night and Saturday afternoon. Some predictions also say New York City, Porland and parts of Connecticut could face eight inches. The Maryland State Highway Administration warned motorists that travel may become hazardous. The agency said it would have salt, snowplows and chain saws at the ready in case of fallen trees. By Sunday, forecasters say the storm is likely to have headed out into the Atlantic once more. After a relatively tame start to the winter, Connecticut has plenty of salt and snow-treatment chemicals stockpiled around the state and a fleet of 632 plow trucks ready to go, Department of Transportation spokesman Kevin Nursick said. He said crews have been pre-treating some highways and bridges, but there already is some salt leftover from recent, smaller storms. 'We don't need to go full tilt,' he said. Storm's brewin': This satellite image shows the system swirling over the Atlantic around midday Thursday. it is expected to sweep over the north-east bringing snow. A second system bound for New England is developing in the Gulf of Mexico . The storm is expected to begin as snow across much of the region, with areas east of I-95 receiving mostly rain. Forecasters say accumulation amounts will depend on how quickly the rain line moves west. The weather service said the Philadelphia area could receive as much as a quarter-inch of ice Saturday morning before the rain arrives. Meteorologist Peter Wichrowski in Upton, New York, said snow likely would start to fall in New York City in the early morning hours of Saturday, with a mix of rain and maybe a little sleet along the coastal areas. He said snowfall totals were expected to be around 1 to 2 inches across eastern Long Island. Baltimore and Washington were expected to get only rain as temperatures hover just above freezing.","Snow expected across Eastern Seaboard from Maryland to Maine .

"When you slick on your mascara and dab on your blusher in a hurry in the morning do you ever stop to think about the consequences it could be having on your heath? One outspoken beauty guru believes that the products we put on our skin could be damaging our immune system, causing yeast infections and even giving us panic attacks. In the same way that we care about what food we put into our mouths, Rose-Marie Swift maintains the same thought-process should go into our beauty regime before it's too late. Scroll down for video . Miranda Kerr's beauty guru Rose-Marie Swift believes she fell ill at the hands of 'toxic' products . The make-up artist, who works with Miranda Kerr, sticks by the mantra: 'the skin is a mirror to your gut', and she speaks from first-hand experience. The self-confessed beauty junkie tried out all sorts of skincare and make-up through work but as the years went by, she started to lose her hair, memory and, at times, she couldn't remember what she had done the day before. 'I had panic and anxiety attacks continually and my hormones were out of control. I found myself getting sicker and weaker and could not get a proper night's sleep at all,' she writes on her website. 'My body was in a constant struggle with candidiasis - a yeast infection throughout my whole body. For years, traditional doctors told me there was nothing wrong, until I finally ended up in the hospital with a completely weakened immune system.' She finally took responsibility for her own health and paid for some very extensive - and expensive - lab work. When one specialist asked her: 'do you work in the cosmetics industry?', something clicked. The make-up artist, seen beautifying Gisele, sticks by the mantra: 'the skin is a mirror to your gut', and she speaks from first-hand experience . Celebrity fans of her range, which uses ingredients such as coconut oil, cocoa butter, bees wax, rosehip oil and vanilla extract, include Emma Waton, left, and Gisele, right . She said: 'I was dumbfounded to learn that make-up and skincare products could cause serious health issues. Sure, companies advertise how their products make us look, but why doesn't anybody tell us how they can make us feel?' Her tests showed that she had toxic levels of the heavy metals lead, cadmium, aluminum, barium and mercury. She also had high levels of pesticides and many other chemicals in her system. The lab even said to her: 'we can't believe you're even walking around.' As a result of her ordeal, several cleanses, and studying nutrition, Rose-Marie launched her a blog, Beautytruth.com, devoted to exposing the use of chemicals in cosmetics, which she believed was to blame for her ill health. She went on to launch her own organic skincare and make-up range, RMS Beauty, which landed in Urban Retreat in Harrods in November. Rose-Marie believes that ingredients in shampoos, hair dyes, and other everyday products may be playing havoc with our hormones that control reproduction. 'We are polluting our physical form and altering our cell structure with this constant chemical assault,' she writes on her blog. She prides herself on  creating a product that's not only non-toxic, but that actually heals and nourishes skin. 'I was surprised to learn that the majority of ingredients used for natural cosmetics are refined, bleached, deodorized, clarified, fractionated and heated to high temperatures. But this means they are not pure natural ingredients anymore - they are now equivalent to man-made chemicals. 'No matter how hard the beauty business proclaims innocence, the undeniable truth is that many of the ingredients in make-up and skincare are toxic to our bodies. It’s time to uncover some beauty truths.' She explains that her products are formulated with raw, food grade and organic ingredients in their natural state, all the things her friend and client Miranda loves . Rose's products, which cost around £30 each, include the living luminizer, left, which aims to highlight skin and is loved by Emma Watson, and the beauty oil, right, which she says contains only the finest exotic oils and rare herbal extracts . 'I consider it my responsibility to share my personal experience and knowledge about these chemicals in our cosmetic' skincare products so that you too can make informed decisions about your own health and beauty,' she said. She explains that her products are formulated with raw, food grade and organic ingredients in their natural state, allowing their living, healing attributes to penetrate and rejuvenate the skin. 'In their purest form, enzymes, vitamins, antioxidants and their healing properties remain fully intact, encouraging amazing potential for anti-aging effects,' she claims. Celebrity fans of her range, which uses ingredients such as coconut oil, cocoa butter, bees wax, rosehip oil and vanilla extract, include supermodels Gisele Bundchen, Miranda Kerr and Karlie Kloss. She concludes: 'We can all have healthy, radiant, beautiful lives if we know the truth.'","Rose-Marie Swift fell ill because of 'toxic' cosmetics .

Lexi, eight, was looking forward to her up and coming communion and had ambitions of being a vet or on television, while her younger sister Katie loved Taylor Smith and was 'thoughtful beyond her years'. Crews found two bodies on Thursday, the second day of excavating the site, and two bodies on Wednesday, according to Anne Arundel County Fire Department spokesman Capt. Russ Davies. Eve Morrison, the wife of Clint Boone, and the mother of Charlotte and Wesley, posted a message to Facebook about the tragedy on Thursday. The mesage said: 'Clint and I would like to thank everyone again for all of your messages and support. It means so much to us all at this time. I am trying to read all the messages and thank you so much for reaching out to us. Although way too short, our babies lives were incredibly happy and they were loved by so many. Thank you everyone so very much. Love to all. XOXO' The post added: 'And of course Don and Sandy 'Dee Dee and Pop Pop' the two most incredible, generous, hilarious people anyone could ever know. I am thankful for the 16 years I had with them too, as I'm sure everyone else who had the pleasure of knowing them is as well. According to The Baltimore Sun, Randy and Stacey Boone, parents of Lexi and Katie, have a three-week-old son who was not at the Pyles' home on Sunday. Tragedy: A firefighter uses red tape to mark out areas at the Annapolis home following a blaze which entirely destroyed the property. Six people were inside the house - two grandparents and their four grandchildren . Crews continued to search the Maryland mansion for bodies on Thursday, saying that they hoped to give the devastated families closure as soon as possible . Alexis  Boone, eight, Kaitlyn  Boone, seven, Charlotte Boone, eight, and six-year-old Wesley Boone were missing following the fire at their grandparents' Annapolis mansion, their family said Wednesday . Firefighters  took about 10 hours to extinguish hot spots on Monday and one area flared up on Tuesday again. Trapped: Don and Sandra Pyle (pictured), were at home at the time of the fire with their grandchildren: Alexis Boone, 8; Kaitlyn Boone, 7; Charlotte Boone, 8; and Wesley Boone, 6. Emotional: The message put on Facebook by Eve Morrison, mother to two of the child victims, Charlotte, 8, and Wesley Boone, 6 . A previous family statement given to WUSA9 read: 'On behalf of the Boone and Pyle families, we wish to express our gratitude and appreciation for the love and support being shared with us during this tragic event. We are blessed that so many family, friends, and neighbors have come together for us in our time of need. 'We recognize the dedicated efforts from Anne Arundel County Fire and Police Departments, the Naval Academy, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and other first responders. We want our community to know how proud we are of all who have helped us. 'Our love for our family is boundless. Our loss demands time and quiet reflection to process these feelings. We ask that you respect our need for privacy. 'Life is fragile. Make time today to embrace your loved ones.' Investigators on Wednesday found two bodies  in the charred remains of the home in Annapolis, Maryland after the property burned to the ground on Monday. The bodies were with the medical examiner and have not yet been identified. It is not known whether the bodies children of adults. Federal and local investigators returned to the site to continue the search on Thursday. Tech tycoon Don Pyle, 56, lived in the 16,000sq ft home with his wife Sandra. Three people embrace outside the gates of the home, where Investigators found the bodies of two unidentified people on Wednesday . Don and Sandra Pyle were home the night of the blaze along with their four grandchildren . 'I never knew that I could hurt this badly,' Stacey Boone, mother to Lexi and Katie with Sandra Pyle's son Randy Boone, wrote on Facebook on Tuesday. 'It's unreal. All one big nightmare that I can't wake up from.' The Pyles and their four grandchildren have been missing since crews were called early on Monday. The blaze has reduced the 16,000-square-foot waterfront castle to ruins. The fire was reported about 3.30am on Monday by an alarm-monitoring company and a neighbor who spotted flames. Officials said it is unclear whether an alarm sounded inside the home, which might have alerted anyone inside. Some 85 firefighters from several jurisdictions fought the fire. Because there was no hydrant in the area, firefighters shuttled tankers to the site and stationed a fire boat at a pier nearby. Davies said hot spots took about 10 hours to extinguish on Monday. One area flared up on Tuesday, and Davies said crews were monitoring it and extinguishing it as needed. Special Agent David Cheplak, a spokesman for the ATF's Baltimore field office, said earlier this week there were no immediate signs of foul play. Mansion fire: The $9million home in Annapolis, Maryland, caught fire around 3:30am Monday . Picturesque: In 2008, Pyle said the house had been built to be a combination of a castle and a beach house . Sources at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives told CNN that the fire engulfed the mansion so fast that they suspect that chemicals may have been used to accelerate the burning. The official in charge of the ATF's investigation would not confirm whether the blaze was suspicious to DailyMail.com. Special Agent William McMullan said that specialists from across the country were headed to Annapolis, and would send in trained dogs to sniff out any traces of accelerant chemicals, which would help determine whether the blaze could have been a deliberate attack. However, Capt. Robert Howarth, commander of the county fire department's fire and explosives investigation unit, said on Tuesday that investigators were treating the site as a crime scene. Howarth said that is a common practice when there are no eyewitnesses, and it means only that anything recovered in the investigation would be admissible in court. Neighbor Caroline Wugofski said the Pyles often held parties at their home. She described them as 'genuinely nice people'. Before: The 16,000sq ft property boasts two swimming pools and its own courtyard, as well as two outbuildings, one of which is connected to the main house by a covered portion. The image above was taken in 2012 . Inferno: The blaze, pictured from the air, tore through the home. Bottom right, firefighters can be seen standing near the pools as they spray water at the ruins . Don Pyle grew up in nearby Baltimore County and worked his way to the top table of several billion-dollar tech companies. In a recent interview with the Washington Post, he said he started off as a salesman, and moved to progressively more important roles before taking the reins at companies with links to Silicon Valley. His latest role was as the COO of ScienceLogic, an IT support company based in Reston, Virginia. He would hold fundraisers for worthy causes at his house. At one in 2008, he told the Baltimore Sun the house had been especially designed to be a combination of a castle, his preference and a beach house, which Sandra wanted. His luscious property stood facing Church Creek, a picturesque inlet not far from the Chesapeake Bay. It has an estimated $9million value. Situated on its own portion of exclusive Childs Point Road, the home boasted a courtyard, swimming pool and access to a speedboat jetty. Real estate listings for the home say it had seven bathrooms and was part of a 7.8-acre estate. The modern, two-storey home, which was built in 2005, also has attic space and a basement. Photographs of the mansion before it burned down show at least four cars parked outside the elegant stone construction, which has several turrets as part of its architecture. ScienceLogic would only confirm that Pyle works for them. A spokesman told DailyMail.com: 'Don Pyle is the Chief Operating Officer for ScienceLogic. 'There was a fire at his home last night and the case is under investigation. We have no further comment.'","Alexis (Lexi) Boone, 8; Kaitlyn (Katie) Boone, 7; Charlotte Boone, 8, and six-year-old Wesley Boone are believed to have died in the fire .

"Try putting an ice-cube in your mouth. The insides of your mouth and tongue instantly turn numb. Hold it in still and you will feel pain. Now try sucking on peppermint. The mint itself is at room temperature, but your mouth instantly feels cold and numb. How did it do that? The answer is menthol, the ingredient that instantly tricks your brain into sensing that the food is cold. Fresh: Mint (pictured) contains menthol which tricks a receptor protein that senses the change in temperature . Nerves are the wiring of the brain, carrying information in the form of electric currents. Our nervous system is built to sense changes in temperatures – a whole set of nerves running from our skin to the brain is dedicated to conveying just that information. The receptor protein that senses the change in temperature is called TRPM8 and it is found in all cold-sensing nerve cells. TRPM8 is a voltage gated ion-channel protein – meaning it allows entry of calcium ions on sensing change in temperature. We don’t exactly understand how TRPM8 does it. Whenever there is a drop in temperature, the voltage on TRPM8 somehow changes and its shape changes so that it allows calcium ions to flow into the nerve cell. This triggers current to flow from the membrane of the nerve cell. This current carrying vital information warns the brain of the temperature fall. Falling temperatures is not the only factor that switches on TRPM8, though. A waxy crystalline organic chemical, called menthol, found in peppermint and other mint oils, can somehow bind to TRPM8 directly and activate it. Cool mint: TRPM8 protein explains why our mouths feel tingly after brushing our teeth . In fact, TRPM8 was first discovered as a protein that responds to menthol and later acknowledged for its role in sensing temperature fall. We have also found other “cooling chemicals” in nature like eucalyptol and icilin, that act similarly. Peppermint drops fire up TRPM8 in cold-sensing nerves and make your mouth instantly feel cool. Even after you have swallowed, some menthol remains and keeps the nerves activated. Just a sip of water can get the nerves fired up again. In fact, our nerves have similar proteins to sense hot temperatures as well. Scientists have discovered a protein called TRP-V1 that acts like TRPM8 to sense a rise in temperature. Capsaicin, the chemical that gives hot peppers their zing, directly activates TRP-V1, giving that intense feeling of heat. Menthol, eucalyptus oil and other cooling agents have long been used to relieve arthritic and other muscle and bone pain. We still don’t understand exactly how it works, but one way it may act is by activating its receptor, TRPM8. Just like your mouth feels numb when you eat peppermint, applying menthol on your skin activates the cold-sensing nerves making the area go numb. Now you no longer feel the pain. Menthol can also bind to another receptor called kappa opioid receptor that can also produce a numbing effect. Chewing gum has been found to remove harmful bacteria from mouths, according to a study. Researchers found that just a single piece of chewing gum can remove 100 million bacteria - 10 per cent of the microbial load in saliva - in ten minutes. And they say that gum can be just as effective as flossing - although they each targets different areas of the mouth. The study, which appeared in the journal Plos One, was led by researchers from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. They found that the gum was most effective in the first 30 seconds of chewing, and after that it would become less effective in trapping bacteria on a sliding scale. Also, they note that only gum that did not contain sugar was useful; if it did contain sugar, it could ‘feed’ oral bacteria. Rubbing menthol on aching muscles also causes the nearby blood vessels to widen, increasing blood flow in the area. This is called vasodilation. Blood carries in fresh nutrients to repair the area and carries away any toxic waste generated. Healing happens a lot faster because of this. Lastly menthol takes away the bad effects of inflammation. The word “inflammation” comes from the Latin word 'inflammare' which means to ignite or be on fire and came to mean this because of its association with the way an injury causes inflammation and a sensation of heat. Menthol gives a sensation of cooling by activating TRPM8 without any actual fall in temperature in that area. This brings down the inflammation in the area. Of course that is why cooling the injury with ice works as well.","Nerves are brain's wiring, carrying messages in form of electric currents .

"Real Madrid’s 16-year-old £2.3million signing Martin Odegaard confirmed on Thursday that the prospect of working with Zinedine Zidane turned his head away from the Premier League and towards the European champions. The Norwegian teenager, who was presented at the club’s training ground, is on a basic £40,000-a-week for his first half-season but can double that with bonuses. He chose Madrid despite visiting Liverpool and Arsenal on a whistle-stop tour of some of Europe’s biggest clubs. Martin Odegaard holds his shirt after being unveiled as a  Real Madrid player .

Odegaard grins after hearing a question during the press conference on Thursday . The Norwegian sensation answered only in Norwegian during his press conference on Thursday . Odegaard arrived in a black-and-white hooped top before sitting down for his press conference . Odegaard scratches his chin as he sits at the press conference with headphones on . Age: 16 (D.O.B. 17/12/98) Born: Drammen, Norway . Position: Attacking midfielder . Clubs: Stromsgodset (2014-15), Real Madrid (2015- . Appearances: 24 . Goals: 5 . International appearances: 3 . International goals: 0 . Odegaard, who will train with the Real Madrid first and second teams, said: ‘It’s a big advantage for me that Real Madrid have a B team playing in a very competitive league and are managed by someone who was one of the best players in the world.’ Madrid B coach Zidane showed Odegaard around the Valdebebas training complex when he visited the Spanish capital at the start of the year. ‘Madrid had the best conditions for me to develop and my aim now is to become the best player I can,’ said Odegaard. The attacking midfielder had previously said Liverpool were his dream club but believes he will develop better at the Bernabeu. Liverpool could have done little more to charm the teenager when they invited him over in December. The then 15-year-old from Stromsgodset and his father, Hans Erik, were given a tour of Anfield and taken for dinner in Liverpool where they met one of his idols, Philippe Coutinho. He trained with the first team the following day and manager Brendan Rodgers told him he hoped he would see him again.

Odegaard and Butragueno look into the crowd as questions are fired at Real Madrid's newest recruit . Click here to read how Celtic attempted to hijack Real Madrid's deal to sign Martin Odegaard. That hope was forlorn. Odegaard had similar trips to Arsenal, Manchester United and City but, as most players find, when Real Madrid come calling they are hard to refuse. Real director Emilio Butragueno admitted that Odegaard could even make his debut for the first team this season although he would first and foremost be at Zidane’s disposal as Real Madrid’s B team ‘Castilla’ try to win promotion back to Spain’s second tier. ‘I feel very much at home,’ said Odegaard in a press conference in which he gave answers only in Norwegian. Already a full Norway international, he speaks only his native tongue along with limited English and no Spanish. Asked if he preferred Leo Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, he gave the diplomatic response: ‘Right now, I prefer Ronaldo.’ According to Barcelona’s sports paper El Mundo Deportivo he is already playing the political game, deleting his previous tweets praising Messi. Odegaard’s heavily incentivised contract means he will pocket £80,000 a week only by picking up all his bonuses, but even his basic £40,000 is a striking figure for someone who did not turn 16 until the week before Christmas. Odegaard celebrates scoring for Stromsgodest in Norway in May 2014 at the age of just 15 . Real are among the clubs who have paid big money for youngsters in the past — and had their fingers burned. In 2010 they signed 18-year-old Sergio Canales for £4m but he never became a first-team regular and is now with David Moyes at Real Sociedad. On Saturday, Real face Bebe — signed as a 19-year-old by Sir Alex Ferguson for £7.4m five years ago and now on loan at Cordoba from Benfica. But there is firm belief that Odegaard will be a success and Thursday’s high-profile presentation saw Real basking in the glory of having beaten many of Europe’s top clubs to sign him. They will take special pleasure in having denied Barcelona. Banned by UEFA from making any signings until 2016, Barca could not follow up their own interest. While Barcelona signed Leo Messi aged 13 and also brought Neymar to Europe, Real’s record for producing world-class players is not as good as their record for buying them. Odegaard is their chance to change that. Odegaard is the youngest player ever to turn out for the Norwegian national side . Odegaard plays for Norway during the 2016 European Championship qualifier against Bulgaria . He will go straight into the B team for what is left of the season in the hope he can help win promotion. They are currently joint-leaders of one of Spain’s regional third divisions. If they can win it they will play off for a place in the second tier. If the B team go up, Odegaard will spend most of next season training with the first team while playing matches for the B side. If they miss out, Odegaard could stay with the first team squad... his father insisting on an assurance that his son will not play third-tier football next season. Odegaard Snr, who will now take a coaching job with Madrid, has clearly not just taken the deal with the best financial package. He made sure Madrid promised to turn their boy into a top-flight footballer at the same pace that Arsene Wenger, Pep Guardiola and Brendan Rodgers would have done at Arsenal, Bayern Munich or Liverpool. Madrid will need to be as good as their word.","Martin Odegaard has signed for Real Madrid for £2.3million .

"Forget Seventies vibes and parka coats, because there's an even bigger trend taking off at Paris Fashion Week - and it's not on the catwalk. Fashion editors have noticed  manspreading has, quite literally, spread from New York to the French capital via Milan. The term, which was originally coined to refer to men who spread their legs and hog an unfair amount of space on packed subway trains in New York, is apparently gaining momentum on the show's hottest front rows. Scroll down for video . Miles Teller, far right, started the manspread at  the Prada show during Milan Menswear Fashion Week . Times style reporter Matthew Schneier posted an exemplary photo on Instagram with the caption: 'Manspreading, dreaded NYC subway phenomenon, has arrived at the front rows in Paris.' And it seems he's onto something. Elle magazine has also picked up on the trend, noting that Miles Teller went wide at Prada, Renzo Rosso kneed his seatmates at DSquared2 and Giuseppe Zanotti cleared the stands at DSquared2. Marisa Berenson, Lewis Hamilton - opening up but still concealing his modesty - and Bryan Ferry on the Louis Vuitton Menswear Fall/Winter 2015 show frow . Giuseppe Zanotti went wide at  Dsquared2  in Milan, left, while Jeremie Laheurte spread at Louis Vuitton . Ben Nordberg spread so wide that Nick Grimshaw was forced to close his lithe legs on the Burberry frow . Even British racing car champion Lewis Hamilton was keen to open up at the Louis Vuitton show. The term first came to light at the end of 2014, when men taking the New York subway were asked to sit more considerately as part of a new campaign to tackle 'manspreading on the city's public transport. Indeed, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority this month unveiled public service advertisements aimed at men who spread their legs and hog an unfair amount of space on packed subway trains. Robert Rabensteiner went for the leg splay at the Calvin Klein Collection in Milan . Jeremie Laheurte and Lewis Hamilton's legs went so wide at Louis Vuitton that Marisa Berenson's were nowhere to be seen . Perhaps all the men should take note from Charlie Hunnam and Jim Nelson . The poster reads: 'Dude...Stop the Spread, Please', alongside an image of two subway commuters forced to stand because a man is sitting in the typical 'manspread stance - legs splayed into a wide V-shape. The campaign, which carries the slogan, 'Courtesy Counts: Manners Make a Better Ride', is also targeting other subway users, such as those whose bulky backpacks get in the way of other riders. Manspreading has become a hotly debated topic for subway riders, who go so far as to post photographs of the worst culprits on Twitter or even confront them on video. A reporter for The Gothamist set out to confront 'manspreaders' on the New York City subway and did not have trouble finding interviewees. She asked each man if they think their own 'leg splay' is appropriate given the people around them. Many insist this is not normal behavior. One commuter explains that his splay is to accommodate a bag, while another says that he is exhausted. And one defiant passenger insists all men biologically require ample space.","Manspreading - when men spread their legs and hog space on trains .

"Having a bad hair day is something every woman can identify with. So some of the claims made in a hilarious new video may be closer to the truth than most of us would like to admit. Hair Dramas by satirical act Sh*t Girls Say, pokes fun at the hilarious the lengths many women will go to to ensure their tresses remain looking good. 'Oh my God! You're lying on my hair!' Several common 'hair dramas' are shown in the video . Originally a Twitter account with just less than two million followers, Sh*t Girls Say's first episode posted on YouTube has been watched more than 20 million times. And their subsequent three videos helped them become a phenomenon. The new footage, to advertise haircare brand Aussie, is filmed in their signature style mashing together many short clips. The video sees Graydon Sheppard, the man behind S*** Girls Say, which he co-founded with Kyle Humphrey, dressed as a woman. 'I can NOT get it wet': Sheppard, in a dark wig, awkwardly totters around a pool keeping his head above water . S*** Girls Say is back after a two year break, and this time they are focusing on hair . Acing out day-to-day activities, Sheppard runs through the inventory of complaints and trials women go  through with their hair. From it being too flat or frizzy to not wanting to get it wet when swimming or crushed when you go to hug someone, every possible hair grumble is enacted. 'Oh my God! You're sitting on my hair!' Sheppard squeals at his on-screen boyfriend in one scene. 'Did I leave my curlers on?' he asks himself walking down the street in another, and in the swimming pool: 'Don't splash me, I can NOT get my hair wet.' The advert ends when Sheppard, sitting on a beach (worrying about the wind's effect on his hair), is nearly hit by a ball thrown by a stunning carefree blonde. 'Watch the hair!': A hug can bring a whole host of hairstyle dangerous . Sheppard battles the issue of the seat belt flattening his locks . Not restricted by concerns about her hair, she is free to return to playing volleyball, while Sheppard can only watch enviously. The humour in this advert and the success of Sh*t Girls Say lies in their astute observations of the subtly of women's personalities. From inflections in their speak to mannerism, Sheppard and Humphrey have managed to create a highly recognizable satirical character. And while they may have not have created any videos recently, the Sh*t Girls Say's Twitter account has remained active, posting thousands of simple observations about women's behaviour. But it was their move to YouTube that really sent Sh*t Girls Say into popular cultural. The Sh*t Girls Say's Twitter account has remained active, posting thousands of simple observations about women's behaviour . Dressing up in drag, the pair filmed themselves imitating a number of cliches and verbal mannerisms often associated with young women. The videos became an overnight success, with many finding the series funny, because 'it's true.' The formula of Sh*t Girls Say reflects some of the most quotable films of the last twenty years about teenage girls, such as Clueless, Bring It On, Mean Girls, and Juno, by using a compilation of easily retrievable and stereotypical one-liners in a culture that revolves around quick status updates and small bites of informatio . However the global success of Sh*t Girls say could be attributed to the fact that the one-liners come from 'real' women, rather than characters on-screen.","Sh*t Girls Say is satirical act depicting observations about women .

"The Duggar family - who shot to fame with the TLC reality series 19 Kids and Counting - promotes not only abstinence until marriage, but also kissing and even hugging, which makes it incredibly shocking that the sister of patriarch Jim Bob has a daughter out of wedlock. It seems that cousin Amy, who has appeared on the show and is the daughter of Jim's sister Deanna, was born when her mother was not married and, what's more, though it may seem as if her husband, Terry Jordan, is Amy's biological father, that may not be the case. In fact, a 2012 interview in which Terry said he and Deanna had been dating for 20 years, which would be five years after Amy, 27, was born, seems to confirm that he is not her father. Scroll down for video . It has been revealed that Jim Bob Duggar's sister Deanna had her daughter Amy out of wedlock (above) What's more, it appears that Deanna's husband Terry Jordan (above) is not Amy's biological father . Amy (front left) poses with a few of the 19 Duggar children . 'Terry and I knew each other a long time ago, and I got pregnant with Amy. And so, we dated each other on and off for quite some time,' Deanna said in a 2009 interview on the show, according to Radar Online. 'Then we finally decided you know what, we need to get married! So we got married, we’ve been together 3 years.' The couple did wed in 2006, and while that may seem against the Duggar family principles, Jim Bob still very much loves his sister. 'We enjoy getting together every week.' Jim Bob (left) is against even hugging beofre marriage, but still has a close relationship with Deanna and Amy (left) Deanna and Terry (above with Kirk Cameron) were married in 2006 and have been together for 22 years . This comes hot on the heels on the revelation that Michelle, the matriarch of the family, has a sister who is a lesbian. Michelle has never said much of the woman, Evelyn Ruark, who did appear in an early episode of the show without her partner, but her sister has called their lifestyle a cult. We are worried about them,’ said her partner Sharon Callahan. ‘We have often thought that Quiverfull is a cult. It appears to be brainwashing to me.’","It has been revealed that Jim Bob Duggar's sister Deanna had her daughter Amy out of wedlock .

"We all know that when it comes to doing as they're told, toddlers can take a little convincing before they comply. However one particularly stubborn little girl refuses point blank to give into her father's demands and provides a compelling argument despite the fact she is not yet able to speak. Irish father Gareth Roe was captured on camera telling his 15-month-old daughter Lola to get down off their television table. Adorable Lola seems absolutely adamant that she does not want to get down off the television table as her father, Gareth Roe, pleads with her . But the defiant young toddler is determined to stay where she is and gets impressively mouthy with her dad, not letting her lack of speech stop her. The  37-second video has received over one million views on YouTube and is currently being shared across social networking sites such as Twitter. The video begins with Gareth firmly telling his daughter: 'Get your foot down off that table!' The super-cute 15-month old is clearly having a good time standing on top of the television table . At one point Gareth leans over poking his cute young daughter gently in the stomach . But little Lola is having none of it and shouts back at her father, shaking her head confidently while staring straight back at him. Gareth then decides to point out that he is in charge and attempts to reinforce his authority with his daughter. 'You can't tell me what to do' he says while pointing a stern finger at her before adding 'I'm your boss until you're 18, now get down!' Lola does not seem intimidated by her father whatsoever and continues to shout and wave her arms. At this point Gareth decides to play on his daughter's muddled speech and pokes her lightly on the chest asking: 'What did you call me?' The person behind the camera, who we can only assume to be Lola's mother, then giggles as Lola shouts back at her unimpressed father. 'Get down this second' he tells her one more time before Lola simply turns away, leaning nonchalantly on the laundry while ignoring her dad's request.

"Jayden Watson, five, was born with rare genetic condition harlequin ichthyosis, which means his skin grows seven times faster than normal . A mother has revealed her heartache enduring the cruel taunts of parents encouraging their children away from her son because they believe he is 'contagious'. The five-year-old actually suffers from an incredibly rare genetic condition which leaves him with  thick, dry, skin resembling 'fish-scales'. Jayden Watson, of Bedford, Warwickshire was born with harlequin ichthyosis, a condition which causes his skin to grow seven times faster than normal. While there is no cure for the painful condition, it is not contagious. But Jayden's mother Jane Blackford said she has had to listen as other parents berate her, telling her to take better care of her son. The 25-year-old said some people have even ushered their children away from Jayden, whose nickname is Super Jayden. 'We were in the park when a woman came storming over,' she recalled. 'She said: ""Keep your child out of the sun, can't you see you've burnt him?"" 'Another day I saw a mother tell her son to stay away from Jayden in case he was contagious. 'It is heartbreaking, but people just aren't aware of the condition.' Harlequin ichthyosis is an extremely rare genetic  skin condition. Parents who carry the gene have a one in four chance of having a child with the illness. It is caused by a mutation in the gene thought to be involved in the transport of fats into the spaces between the skin cells. The skin appears tight, with thick plates of hard scales resembling armour plating or the harlequin suit of a jester, and splits in different areas, causing deep cracks. A sufferer's face looks stretched with turned out lips and eyelids, and the ears, hands and feet may be hidden by scales. Miss Blackford said doctors realised there was something wrong with Jayden as soon as he was born. She said she couldn't see her newborn son straight away, after her 15-hour labour, because he was being cared for in an incubator. She asked her partner Paul Watson, 28, what their son looked like and he said: 'I can't really describe him – it's like he's got scales.' A nurse then warned: 'His appearance might alarm you.' Miss Blackford added: 'Doctors told me he was very ill and might have just days to live but nothing could've prepared me for how poorly my baby looked. Jayden's condition leaves him with thick, dry, fish-scale skin which has to be constantly removed. He is pictured with parents  Jane Blackford, 25 (left) and father Paul Watson, 28, (right) Harlequin ichthyosis is incurable, and parents have to apply ointment to Jayden's skin three or four times a day (he is pictured left and right as a baby). His mother describes how other parents ignorant about the condition incorrectly believe he is 'contagious' and have ushered their children away from him . Despite his condition, Jayden learned to walk and talk and now attends nursery, where he has lots of friends. He is pictured with his mother during a charity run . 'His mouth was stretched open, as if he was silently screaming. The skin all over his body was cracked and bleeding. 'We were told he was suffering from harlequin ichthyosis which is where the skin is thick and extremely dry. 'Jayden's condition was so severe that it was likely he'd pick up a fatal infection. 'As we held him a nurse told us, ""Every moment is precious"".' Miss Blackford said she felt 'overcome with love' for her son, but was terrified she would hurt him. 'We didn't leave his side,' she said. Harlequin Ichthyosis is extremeley rare and severe skin condition. It is caused by a mutation in the ABCA12 gene which is thought to be involved in the transport of fats into the spaces between the skin cells. It is a genetic condition. The parents of an affected baby are carriers and will have a one in four risk of any baby being affected. The condition causes the skin to grow seven times faster than normal. The skin appears tight, with thick plates of hard scales resembling armour plating or the harlequin suit of a jester. The skin splits at several areas causing deep cracks. And a sufferer's face looks stretched with turned out lips and eyelids, and the ears, hands and feet may be hidden by scales. The extra skin needs to be removed constantly and ointment is also applied four or five times-a-day. Babies with the condition tend to be born prematurely and are usually small. Children who survive will need ongoing intensive skin treatment with creams and courses of retinoid medicine and many require physiotherapy and counselling. There is no cure for it and it cannot be prevented. Source: The Ichthyosis Support Group . 'Doctors told us the skin around Jayden's hands and feet was so thick and tight he wouldn't be able to use them if they didn't operate to remove some of the skin.' On June 25, 2010, when Jayden was just two days old, he was taken in for surgery. Afterwards, he was bandaged from head to toe. His dressings were replaced every hour to stop his skin drying out. His mother continued: 'During the next week we were shown how to care for him. 'Every hour throughout the day and night his body needed to be slathered in oil and then bandaged. 'A fortnight later we were allowed to take him home.' Children with the condition need round-the-clock care, as the extra skin needs to be removed constantly and ointment is also applied four or five times a day. Children who survive will need ongoing intensive skin treatment with creams and courses of retinoid medicine and many require physiotherapy and counselling. Miss Blackford said caring for Jayden was difficult at first. She said: 'Applying his lotion during the night left us both exhausted. 'His skin was so sensitive the slightest knock could cause him to bleed.' But as the months passed Jayden thrived. He learned to walk and talk and now attends nursery. After his first day  he even told his parents 'I made three new best friends.' A spokesperson from the Ichthyosis Support Group said harlequin ichthyosis is 'extremely rare and severe'. They said: 'There are approximately five such children born in the UK each year and some may be stillborn. 'The name comes from the appearance of the skin at birth. 'The skin is covered in tight, thick, plates of hard scale and resembles armour plating or the harlequin suit of a jester. When he was just two days old, doctors carried out surgery to remove the thick skin from Jayden's hands and feet. As Miss Blackford held her son for the first time, a nurse told her 'time was precious'. But as the months went on, Jayden thrived. He is pictured with his mother as a baby . 'It splits at several areas causing deep cracks. 'The face looks stretched with turned out lips and eyelids, and the ears, hands and feet may be hidden in the scale. 'The eyes may be invisible because they are temporarily covered by the swollen eyelids. 'The baby's movement and ability to suck is affected and they suffer all the problems of leaky skin. 'They become dehydrated and have poor temperature control, difficulty feeding and sometimes breathing and are also at risk of serious infection.'","Jayden Watson, five, was born with genetic condition harlequin ichthyosis .

"The bodies of a missing Ohio couple were found in their burnt car on Thursday and police are warning residents to keep their doors locked at nights and the lights on. Police are still investigating how the bodies of Doyle, 88, and Lillian Chumney,79, ended up in their cream-colored Pontiac on a remote dirt road in Bakersille, Ohio roughly 30 miles away from their home in Strasberg. Police believe foul play is involved and as of Friday morning there had been no arrests but police were receiving tips. Scroll down for video . Dead: Police are still investigating how the bodies of Doyle, 88, and Lillian Chumney, 79, ended up dead in their burnt vehicle on a remote dirt road 30 miles away from their burglarized home . Burnt outline: All that remained of the car was a burned outline of where it once stood with the dead elderly couple inside, the cause of death still a mystery . Burglarized: the couple's home was ransacked just days before they were discovered dead 30 miles away . News Net 5 reports that on Friday morning the Coshocton County Coroner positively identified the bodies and that they will be sent over to Licking County Coroner for full autopsies. Police removed the vehicle from the scene on Thursday evening but what remained was a ghostly burnt outline of where the car once stood on the narrow and muddy country road. The couple was reported missing on Wednesday after they failed to pick up their son to take him to the airport. When the couple's eldest daughter went to check on her parents she found their vehicle missing and their home ransacked. Drawers were opened and items were missing. The couple was last heard from during a phone conversation on Tuesday evening at 11:00 pm and disappeared sometime between then and Wednesday morning. Towed away: The burnt vehicle is seen being towed away after the missing Ohio couple's bodies were discovered mysteriously dead inside . Police told News Net 5 that the investigation is ongoing and they are not releasing more information at this time but that people should stay attentive to their surroundings and be on the watch for any suspicious characters. Residents of Bakersfield told reporters they were shocked and horrified by the alleged murder. 'It makes you stick to your stomach. Nobody deserves that,' said one neighbor. 'And whoever did this is evil I hope their caught because they don't deserve to be out in society,' said a resident of Bakersfield who was too afraid to show her face, especially with a suspect still on the loose. After the home was burglarized neighbors held a candlelight vigil for the missing couple. 'You can't say it doesn't happen in a town like this, but it just doesn't happen in a town like this,' said another neighbor. One woman said whoever the suspect is might know the area of Bakersville well since the road was small and only natives might know where it is. Troubled: This Ohio resident said the alleged murder made her sick to her stomach and said nobody deserves what happened the elderly couple and her neighbors agreed .","Police are investigating how the bodies of Doyle, 88, and Lillian Chumney, 79, ended up in a burnt vehicle on a remote road 30 miles from their home .

"Scientists have revealed a groundbreaking 3D map of Greenland ice sheet allowing them to look back in time. Using ice-penetrating radar data collected by NASA's Operation IceBridge, the project allows scientists to determine the age of large swaths of the second largest mass of ice on Earth. They say it could also help predict the future for the sheet, an area containing enough water to raise ocean levels by about 20 feet. Scroll down for video . Scientists are studying the ice during different climate periods so they can better predict how the ice sheet will respond in the future. An east Greenland glacier seen from the NASA P-3 in April 2014. Using radars researchers have been able to look inside it. The CReSIS radar transmits signals into the ice and records the strength and time the reflected signals return. They can detect the visible layers in ice that one would read if they were to take an ice core. Instead of only being able to measure one area, however, it can measure large swaths of the ice sheet. CReSIS stands for the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets. The map gives scientists a better picture of the ice sheet's history. Scientists can now determine the age of large swaths of the ice sheet and see how the sheet evolved. Greenland's ice sheet has been losing mass over the past 20 years due to warming temperatures. Scientists are studying the ice during different climate periods so they can better predict how the ice sheet will respond in the future. 'This new, huge data volume records how the ice sheet evolved and how it's flowing today,' said Joe MacGregor, the study's lead author, a glaciologist at The University of Texas. The ice-penetrating radar, called CReSIS radar, has the ability to detect the visible layers in ice that one would read in ice cores. The radar transmits signals into the ice and records the strength and time the reflected signals return. Using this information, researchers were able to determine where the ice surface, sub-ice bedrock, and layers within the ice are. Ice cores show past snow accumulation and temperatures. They also contain impurities such as dust and volcanic ash, which would have been carried in by the snow. The information in ice cores was accumulated and compacted over a period of hundreds of thousands of years. Prior to using the CReSIS radar, researchers were unable to make maps on such a large scale. The researchers also used the data collected from Operation IceBridge's aerial missions, which included flights across the ice sheet that covered tens of thousands of kilometers. Ice Bridge's aerial measurements often intersected areas where researchers already mapped and dated the layers using ice cores. The core data provided by those sites provided reference points for the radar measurements recently collected. Scientists are interested learning about the ice from the Eemian period, which was 115,000 to 130,000 years ago, because the temperatures then were about as warm as today's. The new data provides the first data-based estimate of where ice from that period lies within the sheet. The ice-penetrating radar, called CReSIS radar, has the ability to detect the visible layers in ice that one would read in ice cores. Comparing this age volume to simple computer models helped the study's team better understand the ice sheet's history. Differences in the mapped and modeled age volumes point to past changes in ice flow or processes such as melting at the ice sheet's base. This information will be helpful for evaluating the more sophisticated ice sheet models that are crucial for projecting Greenland's future contribution to sea-level rise. 'Prior to this study, a good ice-sheet model was one that got its present thickness and surface speed right. 'Now, they'll also be able to work on getting its history right, which is important because ice sheets have very long memories,' said MacGregor.","Scientists built an unprecedented map of the layers inside ice sheet .

"Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are hoping to make bitcoin mainstream by creating the first regulated Bitcoin exchange in the United States. The Winklevoss twins, who famously accused Facebook Inc founder Mark Zuckerberg of stealing their idea, have been seeking regulatory approval for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund. The call their project the 'Nasdaq of Bitcoin'. Twins Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss, who famously accused Facebook Inc founder Mark Zuckerberg of stealing their idea, have been seeking regulatory approval for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.

Bitcoin is not backed by a government or central bank and its value fluctuates according to demand by users. Users can transfer bitcoins to each other over the Internet and store the currency in digital 'wallets.' The investor twins have hired engineers from top hedge funds, enlisted a bank and engaged regulators with the aim of opening their exchange in the coming months. 'Today, my brother Tyler and I are proud to announce Gemini: a next generation bitcoin exchange,' Cameron Winkevoss wrote on their site. ''What exactly do we mean by 'next generation'? We mean a fully regulated, fully compliant, New York-based bitcoin exchange for both individuals and institutions alike. Why? Because it’s about time.' The brothers, who received $65 million in Facebook shares and cash in 2008 after a battle with with its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, will finance the exchange themselves. 'Since last February, Tyler and I have been assembling the Gemini team. 'Our goal was simple: bring together the nation’s top security experts, technologists, and financial engineers to build a world-class exchange from the ground up with a security-first mentality. 'It’s true that Bitcoin’s promise is a new, frictionless money, but that all becomes academic if we don’t build towards an ecosystem that is free of hacking, fraud and security breaches.'

Last March, New York's financial services regulator Benjamin Lawsky said he wanted companies that want to operate virtual currency exchanges in the state to submit formal applications, in a step toward eventual state regulation of bitcoin exchanges. The New York regulator held two days of hearings with industry participants last January, including the Winklevoss brothers, and said he planned to issue 'BitLicenses' to virtual currency firms.

"A distraught mother is living in fear after she found the cross from her 10-year-old daughter's grave buried upside down in her garden and 'RIP' sprayed across her bedroom window. Florica Tiru, 45, said she is too frightened to go outside following the attacks at her home in Willesborough, Ashford. The cross was on the grave of her daughter Ana-Maria who had cerebral palsy and died in July 2010 aged 10. Miss Tiru said only a handful of people knew the location of the grave which made her even more fearful. Florica Tiru said she is too scared to leave her house after her bedroom window was smashed and 'RIP' sprayed on to it . The mother-of-two also discovered her 10-year-old daughter's grave buried upside down in her garden . The mother-of-two, who came to England from Romania in 2008, said: 'What hurts me the most is that someone took my daughter's cross from her grave and brought it here. 'Only a few people know where my daughter's grave is. I'm so angry and hurt. I want to put the cross back but I'm scared it will be taken again or go missing. 'I feel like I am just waiting for the next thing to happen. I'm scared for my life, scared they will hurt me. I haven't left the house since all this started.' She added: 'It has been very hard since Ana-Maria died. I can't sleep very well.' Miss Tiru is currently being cared for by her neighbours as she is too petrified to leave her house . Miss Tiru, who came to England from Romania in 2008, said she was 'scared for her life' after the attacks . The cross was on the grave of her daughter Ana-Maria who had cerebral palsy and died in July 2010 aged 10 . In a second attack, while Miss Tiru was in her living room, a brick was thrown through her bedroom window . The first attack took place last Thursday. Miss Tiru had been in Ashford town until about 3pm and then returned home. At 7pm, a neighbour knocked on her door and asked if she had seen what was outside. She discovered the cross, which had been taken from her daughter's grave, as well as the chilling graffiti sprayed on the window. Her daughter was buried at St Mary the Virgin Church in  Willesborough. Then, on Wednesday night, Miss Tiru, who was in her living room, was woken when a brick came through the same window that had been sprayed, landing on her bed. Eggs were also thrown at her kitchen window. Miss Tiru, who has two children aged 25 and 27 living in London, is currently being cared for by her neighbours. Jeanette Law, 48, said: 'Since Wednesday I have been with her from 8am till midnight every day. 'I stayed the night Wednesday because she was so scared. She hasn't slept in her room since it all started, she's too scared.' Police are investigating reports of an ongoing dispute between neighbours around her home. A spokesman for Kent police said: 'We are aware of all the incidents and are following all reasonable lines of inquiry.

"Samantha Cameron was last night dragged into a Coalition spat over the use of Downing Street after it emerged she hosted a Conservative campaign event at No 10. Tory candidates standing in Liberal Democrat seats across the country were invited to bring constituents to the drinks reception with the Prime Minister’s wife. Lib Dem MPs last night accused David Cameron of misusing the official residence by organising party political events in the taxpayer-funded property less than four months before the election. Samantha Cameron poses with Rebecca Pow (second right), Tory candidate for Taunton Deane, and guests Adam Fouracre (first right) and Barrie Palmer (left) at a Conservative campaign event at No 10 on January 13 . Mrs Cameron hosted the first of a series of parties earlier this month where she posed for pictures with Tory candidates and high-profile community figures from their constituencies who had been invited by the election hopefuls. The prospective MPs were then given the photos to help raise their profiles in their local newspapers, along with almost identical quotes from Mrs Cameron about how pleased she was to welcome them to No 10. Jeremy Browne, Lib Dem MP for Taunton Deane, in Somerset, said he was concerned ‘about propriety and abuse of office’ and described the reception as a ‘bit sleazy’. Lib Dem MPs accused David Cameron of misusing the official residence by organising party political events in the taxpayer-funded property . The Conservative candidate for the seat, Rebecca Pow, took two constituents to the event with Mrs Cameron on January 13, before taking two further guests from her community to a second No 10 drinks reception the following week. Mr Browne, who is standing down at the election, said: ‘It is a scandal. It is the official residence of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Downing Street is not the property of the Conservative Party.’ Another Lib Dem, Chippenham MP Duncan Hames, said the events were ‘a desperate attempt by Conservative Central Office to artificially create some standing for their candidates’. As well as the candidate for Taunton Deane, the prospective Tory MPs for North Devon, Somerton and Frome, Bath, Kingston and Surbiton, Torbay, and Cheltenham attended the reception with two guests with Mrs Cameron on January 13. And on Monday, the Prime Minister hosted a similar event with guests including the candidates for Taunton Deane and Chippenham. The ministerial code states that government property cannot be used for party fundraising. However, official residences can be used, as long as no public money is involved. A Tory spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister hosts events for community and charity champions as part of his and the Conservative Party’s recognition of the incredibly valuable work that they do. 'These events are paid for by the Conservative Party, not the taxpayer.’","Tory candidates were invited to bring constituents for drinks on Jan 13 .

"Armed robbers flee into the street after a smash-and-grab raid on an exclusive jewellery store. But as they run off, a have-a-go hero leaps on one of the gang and grapples with him. The smartly-dressed City worker lets go only when the helmeted robber pulls out a 16in machete. The raider escapes, only for a policeman in plain clothes to chase him down. Last night two accomplices remained on the run. Scroll down for video . An armed robber whose gang had raided a watch and diamond shop in central London was wrestled by a man as he tried to get away . The dramatic scenes in London’s Liverpool Street were filmed by a bystander on his mobile phone. The gang, all wearing dark clothing, masks and crash helmets, smashed their way into Carr Watches and Diamonds on Thursday lunchtime. They used a concrete slab to shatter the toughened glass door before threatening company owner Dominic Carr, 47, with the machete. They smashed glass display cases with sledgehammers and stole watches worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. As the three men, all thought to be in their late teens or early 20s, climbed on two mopeds, a police officer tried to block them in an unmarked car. The man then jumps on the raider  before retreating when he is threatened with a two-foot long machete - the robber then runs away . He was threatened with the machete and backed off. In the confusion, two of the robbers escaped, abandoning the third – who was leapt on by the City worker. After pulling out the machete and breaking free, the raider ran off only to be cornered by the police officer in a car park less than 300 yards away and arrested. One witness said: ‘I could not believe what I was seeing in the middle of Liverpool Street. It was surreal, like something out of a Hollywood movie. We were all looking on in total shock and horror, it did not last long but everything was total chaos. The gang - dressed in black clothing and motorbike helmets - raided Carr Watches and Diamonds  in central London yesterday . Pictures show the brave man running up behind the raider and attempting to tackle him to the floor . ‘The man who tried to stop them was a real have-a-go hero. He could have been killed. He looked tough but when you are against a machete you have no chance. At least he slowed them down though.’ Shop owner Mr Carr was unharmed but extremely shaken following the raid. His staff said the gang struck in ‘a matter of seconds’. Ish Ahmet, 30, said: ‘It was all a shock, it was over so quickly. They came in the shop and then it was a bit of a blur. We are not sure what they got away with, some watches we think, maybe Rolexes.’ The have-a-go hero gets on the man's back, but is then threatened by the robber, who then runs off . The man and a builder who came to his aid had to back off as the raider brandished a machete which he pulled from his trousers . Smash-and-grab gangs, often using stolen mopeds to get away, have struck at several luxury jewellery, clothing and handbag stores in affluent London streets in recent years. Detectives suspect that many of those responsible are young men recruited by older organised criminals, who pay them a fraction of the value of their haul. Alex Parle, 22, of Bermondsey, South East London, appeared before magistrates yesterday charged with conspiracy to commit robbery and threatening Mr Carr with a machete. He was remanded in custody and will appear at the Old Bailey next month. Do you know the have-a-go hero? Phone 0203 615 0988 or email neil.chandler@mailonline.co.uk .

"Cleaners are being paid £3.20 a day to scrub roads, stray dogs are being 'rounded up' and curfews have been imposed on locals as India prepares for the arrival of President Barack Obama. He arrives this weekend for an unprecedented second visit by a serving U.S. president, the honoured guest of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was a Washington outcast only a year ago. And with a visit to the Taj Mahal on the President and his wife's itinerary, authorities are furiously working to ensure it leaves a lasting impression. Scroll down for video . A man scrubs the road leading to the Taj Mahal in Agra ahead of President Obama and his wife's visit . A man hoses down the road where hundreds of cleaners have been tasked with washing away spit stains . In addition to the massive cleaning project, stray dogs are being rounded up and two tonnes of rubbish has been removed from the polluted Yamuna River. Pictured is a man scrubbing the street . A boy runs with a stray dog in one of the slums located close to the Taj Mahal . Stray dogs have been rounded up, two tonnes of rubbish have been cleared from the nearby river and a lockdown has been ordered around the entire Taj Mahal complex. Remarkably, more than 600 cleaners have also been employed, many of which have been ordered to scrub the 10mile stretch of road leading to the complex on their hands and knees, NDTV reported. Paid only 300rupees (£3) a day, the men and women have been tasked with washing away spit stains and dust. KK Mohammed, India's former chief archaeologist, said: 'There are a lot of spit stains and such that need to be washed away. The streets need to be spick and span.' Obama's courtship of Prime Minister Modi is evident from his three-day itinerary, the first time an incumbent president has returned to India. While recent swings through Asia have included multiple stopovers, India is Obama's only destination this time, despite the risk of offending neighbouring Pakistan. 'There's no question this is a defining time in the US-India relationship,' US Ambassador Richard Verma said in New Delhi yesterday. 'Things not only feel different, they are different.' Modi's election in May 2014 was a potential headache for the US, which had blacklisted the Hindu nationalist for more than a decade after deadly communal riots in Gujarat when he was state chief minister. He was only brought in from the cold last February when Verma's predecessor travelled to Gujarat once it appeared Modi was likely to end the centre-left Congress party's 10-year rule.

"A cloistered nun has stunned her mother superior and sisters after giving birth to a baby boy after complaining of severe stomach pains. The sister, who belonged to an order in Macerata, in the eastern Italian region of Le Marche, claimed to have no idea she was pregnant when she was rushed to hospital in agony, after which she gave birth. The South American nun, who arrived at the convent in June, when it is supposed she was already pregnant, was taken to the emergency department of 'Bartolomeo Eustachio' di San Severino Marche by her fellow sisters. The childbearing nun, originally from South America, claimed to have 'no idea' she was pregnant . Doctors quickly unravelled the cause of the mysterious ailment, Il Corriere Adriatico reported. The baby was born healthy but remains in hospital to undergo more checks, while the nun's convent has expressed an interest in taking care of him, according to L'Unione Sarda. The case bears a striking similarity to that of a 33-year-old Salvadorean nun in Italy, who gave birth to a baby boy last year, whom she named after Pope Francis. She told her social worker she did not feel guilty and would raise the child saying: 'I am so happy. 'He is a gift from God. I feel more of a mother than a nun.' In 2011 a Congolese nun in an Italian order gave birth to a baby girl after being raped by a priest. She gave up the baby for adoption but after being refused re-entry to the convent changed her mind and recovered the child.","A nun complaining of stomach pains has given birth to a baby boy in Italy .

"Poaching and wildlife crimes are worth an estimated £11billion ($19billion) annually - and it’s terrorist groups that are cashing in, according to a new report. U.S think tank the Stimson Center, which carried out the study, is urging governments around the world to work with each other, local residents and the private sector to put a stop to the horrific crimes. The most valuable poaching victims are elephants and rhinos that roam Africa in rapidly decreasing numbers and Al Shabaab, which counts Briton Samantha Lewthwaite, aka the White Widow, among its members, is one of the terrorist groups identified as driving the slaughter of the animals. Samantha Lewthwaite's Al Shabaab organisation is one of the terrorist groups cashing in on poaching . The number of black rhinos in Kenya has fallen from about 20,000 in the 1970s to approximately 650 today. Poachers continue their illegal killing because it is highly profitable. Elephant tusks and rhino horns are sold at extraordinary prices - $50,000 (£30,000) a pound for rhino horns on the black market. Al Shabaab mounted September’s attack on Nairobi’s Westgate shopping mall in which more than 70 people died. By some estimates, just ten tusks would have been enough to finance that operation. Declaring that the slaughter of elephants contributes directly to the killing of humans, the Elephant Action League (EAL) calls ivory ‘the white gold of jihad’. Elephant tusks and rhino horns are sold at extraordinary prices - $50,000 a pound for rhino horns on the black market . Al Shabaab apparently pays above the odds for ivory, but so great is the mark-up that it generates up to 40 per cent of its revenues from the trade and can pay its 5,000-odd fighters £180 a month plus food and khat – the drug used by almost every male Somali. It is thought the fanatics make £400,000 a month selling 'blood ivory' on the black market. EAL launched a two year undercover investigation of elephant poaching in Kenya in 2011. Andrea Crosta, who led the investigation, said many poachers he spoke to said they were increasingly selling to al-Shabaab, New Scientist reported. Trade: It is thought terrorist group Al Shabaab earn £400,000 a month selling 'blood ivory' on the black market . Armed wardens with Kalashnikov guns patrol a reserve in Kenya . The ivory is then sold on to markets in Asia, at hugely inflated prices. He said: 'Part of al-Shabaab's funding has been, and is still, from ivory.' He added that according to sources in the militant group, 3 tonnes of ivory were passing through Somalian ports each month.","U.S think tank the Stimson Center has urged governments to intervene .

"A group of daredevil climbers have shown just how fearless they are after camping out on the side of a frozen cliff face in frigid Kyrgyzstan. These jaw-dropping photos show climbers Thomas Senf, Ines Papert and Wolfgang Rusegger taking a break while scaling Mount Kyzyl Asker in Central Asia. The adrenaline junkies were tackling the 19,000ft mountain when a storm forced them to stop in their tracks just 985ft from the summit. Scroll down for video . Thomas Senf, Ines Papert and Wolfgang Rusegger camped out on the side of Mount Kyzyl Asker in Kyrgyzstan when bad weather struck . The adrenaline junkies were tackling the 19,000ft mountain when a storm forced them to stop in their tracks just 985ft from the summit . Unfortunately for the climbers they were forced to abandon their icy climb due to the storm, which brought heavy snow and avalanches . With the deteriorating conditions posing a significant threat to their safety they quickly jumped into their sleeping bags and braced themselves for the storm, which brought heavy snow and triggered avalanches. Thomas’ photographs have only recently been revealed to the public after the 2010 expedition. The 33-year-old said: ‘It was a kind of “1,000-star hotel” experience, a very unique experience.

"School show and tells aren't, by their very nature, normally explosive affairs. But one that took place at Suncoast Elementary School in Florida on Thursday carried a little extra excitement, because one of the pupils took a grenade to it.

Authorities said that no bodies were found inside the vehicle, which is now virtually unrecognizable . Atchison's parents were away at the time so there was a delay in him being reported missing. He attended Miramar High School and Ms Null went to Plantation High School when they disappeared.

"Serbia captain Branislav Ivanovic has blamed his team's 3-1 home defeat by Denmark in their Euro 2016 Group I qualifier on a lack of commitment among the players and their habit of underestimating the opposition. 'We see ourselves as big stars and always think we are better than others and that's a very bad attitude,' the Chelsea defender told reporters after Serbia were blown away by the Danes in an empty stadium on Friday. 'The players are obviously unaware what it means to put on a Serbia shirt and play for the national team. This has been going on for years and we can't carry on like that.' Serbia captain Branislav Ivanovic was unhappy after his side's 3-1 loss at home to Denmark on Friday . Chelsea and Serbia midfielder Nemanja Matic is tackled during Serbia's disappointing defeat to Denmark . The match was played behind closed doors after the Serbians started serving a two-game crowd ban for fan violence in their previous home game against Albania, abandoned after a drone stunt triggered a player brawl and a pitch invasion by Serbian fans. Winger Zoran Tosic gave Serbia an early lead but the home side fell apart in the second half, when a Nicklas Bendtner double and a Simon Kjaer header turned the match on its head. Ivanovic's Chelsea team mate Nemanja Matic, a rare beacon of light on a gloomy evening for Serbia, believes the Balkan nation must adopt a long-term strategy if they are to improve. 'We are simply not good enough,' he said. Nicklas Bendtner (left) scored twice for Denmark as they beat Serbia 3-1 in Belgrade . Former Arsenal striker Bendtner wheels away after scoring for Serbia at the Partizan Stadium . 'We have to be realistic and adopt a 10-year plan like most top teams do. Belgium are a good example as they went through a long barren spell and are now one of the most feared teams in Europe.' The result piled the pressure on Serbia and their Dutch coach Dick Advocaat, who said he was considering quitting, after a tepid 1-1 opening draw at Armenia was followed by the ill-fated match against Albania. The Serbians were awarded a 3-0 walkover win over the Albanians but also docked three points and having appealed the latter part of the verdict, they now have one point from two games ahead of difficult visits to Portugal and Denmark in March and June respectively. 'We will keep going until the bitter end but honestly, our chances to qualify are minimal and it's going to be a mountain to climb,' Matic said.","Serbia lost 3-1 at home to Denmark in their Group I Euro 2016 qualifier .

"Vice President Joe Biden came clean on Thursday about his inability to keep a straight face during President Barack Obama's State of the Union addresses.

"England Under 19s ended 2014 on a high after a resounding 3-0 win against Italy in Rotherham. It was a night in which Chelsea’s young stars shined, as an Izzy Brown brace and a Ruben Loftus-Cheek strike ensured Sean O’Driscoll’s perfect start to his reign continued. It was the head coach’s fourth win in four matches in charge of the Young Lions, and in front of a packed house at the New York Stadium, he put out a side full of attacking intent. Ruben Loftus-Cheek scores the third goal for England Under 19s at the New York Stadium . England U19s (4-3-3): Angus Gunn (Manchester City); Joshua Aina (Chelsea), Brendan Galloway (Everton), Ashley Smith-Brown (Manchester City) Ben Chilwell (Leicester City); Bryn Morris (C) (Middlesbrough), Bamidele Alli (MK Dons), Ruben Loftus-Cheek (Chelsea); Brandon Barker (Manchester City), Isaiah Brown (Chelsea), Patrick Roberts (Fulham). Substitutes: Harry Winks (Tottenham Hotspur) for Morris (62), Charlie Colkett (Chelsea) for Alli, (62), Alex Kiwomya (Chelsea) for Roberts (62), Robert Dickie (Reading) for Aina (72), Kean Bryan (Manchester City) for Chilwell (72), Bradley Fewster (Middlesbrough) for Brown (72), Edward Smith (Southend United) for Gunn (76). Substitutes not used: Russell Griffiths (Everton). Goals: Brown (15, 20), Loftus-Cheek (64). Head coach: Sean O’Driscoll . Captain Bryn Morris lined up in front of the back four, with Dele Alli and Loftus-Cheek given licence to push forward and support the exciting front trio of Patrick Roberts, Brown and Brandon Barker. On a cold night in South Yorkshire, England came out of the blocks on fire with Brown looking lively from the first shrill of the referee’s whistle and firing inches wide with a wicked left-foot effort before many of the sell-out crowd had even taken their seats. Minutes later Roberts, Loftus-Cheek and Brown combined on the edge of the box, but Loftus-Cheek fired just over. England had hit the ground running the crowd though and, growing in excitement, the crowd could sense a goal was coming. And on 15 minutes, Alli broke forward and clipped an excellent cross into the box from the right, perfectly onto the head of Loftus-Cheek. The midfielder’s header was well saved by Simone Scuffet, but he could only push it into the path of Brown who riffled home from close range. Five minutes later England doubled their lead, and it was that man Brown again. The 17-year-old was tormenting the Azzurrini back line and he added the second goal with a wonderful strike . England's Alex Kiwomya takes on Alessio Lo Porto of Italy Under 19s . Italy's Alessio Lo Porto clears the ball under pressure from Bradley Fewster of England . After picking up a short corner from Barker, he carried the ball into shooting range before unleashing an unstoppable curling effort past Scuffet. At the other end, ‘keeper Angus Gunn remained largely untroubled in the England goal. Italian captain Lorenzo Pellegrini whipped a dangerous free-kick across his six-yard box early on, though nobody could get a touch. Luca Vida also went close, but failed to hit the target with a root-foot effort as England kept Alessandro Pane’s side at arm’s length throughout. The second half followed a similar pattern to the first, with England on the attack from the off. Loftus-Cheek went close just after the restart with a shot from inside the box, and captain Morris fired inches over from long range after being teed up with a short free-kick. England forward Patrick Roberts  is fouled by Arturo Calabresi on Italy . The midfield continued to dominate, and just after the hour mark Loftus-Cheek got his reward for a fine display with a goal of his own. As he supplied Brown in the first half, this time his club colleague turned provider. After good work in the box, he squared to Loftus-Cheek who finished with aplomb, clipping it over the onrushing goalkeeper to put the game out of the Italy’s reach. They could have had a fourth too, as Loftus-Cheek rounded the ‘keeper and squared for sub and Chelsea team-mate Alex Kiwomya, but the winger could not shift his feet in time and the ball flew away to safety. Substitute Bradley Fewster could then have added to his impressive tally of five in the past five games, but his shot was blocked in the dying moments and the referee whistled to applause from all four corners of the South Yorkshire crowd.","Sean O’Driscoll's perfect start to his reign continued with fourth win .

"Doctors have found a way of putting healthy people's poop into pills to cure serious gut infections - a less invasive way of carrying out 'fecal transplants'. Canadian researchers tried the new tactic on 27 patients and cured them all after strong antibiotics failed to help. While it sounds like a gross problem, it's also a serious one; half a million Americans get Clostridium difficile, or C-diff, infections each year, and about 14,000 die. The germ causes nausea, cramping and diarrhea. A very potent and pricey antibiotic can kill C-diff but also destroys good bacteria that live in the gut, leaving it more susceptible to future infections. Inventive: Dr. Thomas Louie, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Calgary, holds a container of stool pills that are helping to fight gut infections using samples from healthy people . Recent studies have shown that fecal transplants - giving infected people stool from a healthy donor - can restore that balance. But they're given through expensive, invasive procedures like colonoscopies or throat tubes. Doctors also have tried giving the stool through enemas but the treatment doesn't always take hold. There even are YouTube videos on how to do a similar treatment at home via an enema. A study in a medical journal of a small number of these 'do-it-yourself' cases suggests the approach is safe and effective. Dr. Thomas Louie, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Calgary, devised a better way - a one-time treatment custom-made for each patient. Less invasive: Dr Louie  prepares vials in the process of making stool pills which treat Clostridium difficile, or C-diff, infections. Every year around 14,000 die from this condition in the U.S. The 'poop pills' are being used to treat a serious condition called Clostridium difficile, also known as C-Diff. It is a bacterium that can cause a wide range of symptoms including from diarrhea, cramping and weight loss to kidney failuer and a life-threatening inflammation of the colon. If not treated promptly, the condition can lead to a perforation of the bowel or even death. Elderly patients in hospitals or long-term facilities are most often affected, but young and healthy individuals are also known to get the condition. It can be contracted through the health care facility, where more people carry it, and it is passed in feces and spread to surfaces when infected people do not wash their hands properly. The bacterium can be treated with antibiotics, probiotics, fecal transplants - and now, the poop pills. Each year, more than half a million people get sick from the bacterium and 14,000 die. Donor stool, usually from a relative, is processed in the lab to take out food and extract the bacteria and clean it. It is packed into triple-coated gel capsules so they won't dissolve until they reach the intestines. 'There's no stool left - just stool bugs. These people are not eating poop,' and there are no smelly burps because the contents aren't released until they're well past the stomach, Louie said. Days before starting the treatment, patients are given an antibiotic to kill the C-diff. On the morning of the treatment, they have an enema so 'the new bacteria coming in have a clean slate,' Louie said. It takes 24 to 34 capsules to fit the bacteria needed for a treatment, and patients down them in one sitting. The pills make their way to the colon and seed it with the normal variety of bacteria. Louie described 27 patients treated this way on Thursday at IDWeek, an infectious diseases conference in San Francisco. All had suffered at least four C-diff infections and relapses, but none had a recurrence after taking the poop pills. Margaret Corbin, 69, a retired nurse's aide from Calgary, told of the misery of C-diff. 'It . lasted for two years. It was horrible. I thought I was dying. I . couldn't eat. Every time I ate anything or drank water I was into the . bathroom,' she said. 'I never went anywhere, I stayed home all the . time.' With her daughter as the donor, she took pills made by Louie two years ago, and 'I've been perfectly fine since,' Corbin said. Life saving: Donor stool, usually from a relative, is processed in the lab to extract the bacteria and clean it. It is packed into triple-coated gel capsules so they won't dissolve until they reach the intestines . Dr. Curtis Donskey of the Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center, who has done fecal transplants through colonoscopies, praised the work. 'The approach that Dr. Louie has is completely novel - no one else has done this,' he said. 'I am optimistic that this type of preparation will make these procedures much easier for patients and for physicians.' The treatment now must be made fresh for each patient so the pills don't start to dissolve at room temperature, because their water content would break down the gel coating. Minnesota doctors are testing freezing . stool, which doesn't kill the bacteria, so it could be stored and . shipped anywhere a patient needed it. 'You . could have a universal donor in Minnesota provide a transplant for . someone in Florida. That's where we're heading,' Donskey said. Success: Researchers tried the tactic on 27 patients and cured them all after strong antibiotics failed to help . Other researchers are trying to find which bacteria most help fight off C-diff. Those might be grown in a lab dish and given to patients rather than the whole spectrum of bacteria in stool. The hope is 'we could administer that as a probiotic in a pill form,' Donskey said. Louie sees potential for the poop pills for other people with out-of-whack gut bacteria, such as hospitalized patients vulnerable to antibiotic-resistant germs. 'This approach, to me, has wide application in medicine,' he said. 'So it's not just about C-diff.'","Stool samples taken from healthy relatives processed and packed into pill cases that dissolve when they reach the intestines .

"The great-niece of Walt Disney has come out in support of Meryl Streep after the actress's controversial remarks calling the icon 'anti-semitic' and a 'gender bigot.' Abigail Disney, 54, an activist and filmmaker, took to Facebook to address Streep's indictment of Walt Disney during her National Board of Review presentation on January 7. Ultimately, wrote Disney, although she has 'mixed feelings' about Walt Disney, she 'loved' Streep's comments about her illustrious relative. Disney descendant: Abigail Disney says her great-uncle was, as Meryl Streep says, sexist, racist and anti-semitic . Scathing remarks: Actress Meryl Streep called Walt Disney a 'gender bigot' and 'anti-Semitic' in her speech on Tuesday. But she also praised her friend and fellow actress, Emma Thompson, as a 'beautiful artist' Streep attended the National Board of Review dinner to pay homage to fellow actress Emma Thompson for her portrayal of Mary Poppins' creator P.L. Travers in the Disney film Saving Mr Banks. But in between her praise of Thompson, she managed to include a few scathing comments about Walt Disney, whom she called a ‘hideous anti-Semite’ who ‘formed and supported an anti-Semitic industry lobby. And he was certainly, on the evidence of his company’s policies, a gender bigot’. Streep read a letter that his company wrote in 1938 to an aspiring female animator. It included the line, ‘Women do not do any of the creative work in connection with preparing the cartoons for the screen, as that task is performed entirely by young men.’ ‘Some of his associates reported that Walt Disney didn’t really like women,’ Streep said, quoting esteemed animator Ward Kimball on his old boss: ‘He didn’t trust women or cats.’ Legacy: His grandniece says that Walt Disney (pictured in 1951) was a visionary who has made billions of people happy with his work . Last Friday, Abigail Disney wrote about Streep's speech on her Facebook page. 'I . hadn't heard a word about this Meryl Streep/Walt Disney flap till this . morning. Funny how no one mentioned it to me.... Like I was living in . some kind of information bubble and nobody wanted to hurt my feelings or . something. But if anyone is going to have mixed feelings about a . cultural icon, wouldn't it be a member of the family??? More than anyone . else???' she wrote, reports The Hollywood Reporter. 'And . if you are going to have mixed feelings about a family member (and we . all do) take it from me, you really need to be as honest as possible . about those feelings, or else you are going to lead yourself into many a . blind alley in life!!' She went on to agree with Streep's accusations of racism and sexism. 'Anti-Semite? Check. Misogynist? OF COURSE!! Racist? C'mon he made a film (Jungle . Book) about how you should stay 'with your own kind' at the height of . the fight over segregation! As if the 'King of the Jungle' number wasn't . proof enough!! How much more information do you need?' Meryl Streep branded Disney a misogynist in her speech and rumors have long swirled about his anti-Semitic leanings and the racial stereotypes in his early films. So what are the charges laid against Disney - and are they true?The charge: Disney was racistWalt Disney's films from the 1930s and '40s - particularly 'Song of the South' - are full of offensive racial stereotypes. In one, Mickey Mouse wears black-face, and in 'Fantasia' Sunflower, a half-donkey, half-black centaurette carries around a watermelon. However, biographer Neal Gabler in his 2009 book 'Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination' concludes, 'Walt Disney was no racist. He never, either publicly or privately, made disparaging remarks about blacks or asserted white superiority. Like most white Americans of his generation, however, he was racially insensitive.'The charge: Disney was anti-SemiticIn 1938, a month after the infamous anti-Jewish pogrom Kristallnacht, Disney welcomed German filmmaker and Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl to his Hollywood studios. He was also associated with the very anti-Semitic Motion Picture Alliance.Gabler says Disney was personally not anti-Jewish. 'There is some dispute whether the same spirit of tolerance extended to the studio, but of the Jews who worked there, it was hard to find any who thought Walt was an anti-Semite,' he writes. Jewish author Douglas Brode points out in his book 'Multiculturalism and the Mouse: Race and Sex in Disney Entertainment' that Disney was the first filmmaker to cast a Jewish Santa Claus (Ed Wynn in 'Babes in Toyland') and other Disney films feature Jewish actors in a wide range of roles. The charge: Disney was sexistAs Streep correctly pointed out, women were not permitted to do creative work at Walt Disney. And, according to Ward Kimball at least, Disney did not trust women. However, Disney was a product of his time. According to the Hollywood Reporter, women were confined to inking and painting in animation during the 1930s at all the major studios. Retta Scott became Disney’s first female animator on 1942’s 'Bambi,' and in the ’40s and ’50s, Mary Blair was art supervisor and color stylist for 'Saludos Amigos,' 'The Three Caballeros,' 'Cinderella,' 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Peter Pan.' No angel: Tom Hanks as Walt Disney and Emma Thompson as P.L. Travers in the film Saving Mr Banks . Streep softened the blow during her speech by adding that ‘there is a piece of received wisdom that says that the most creative people are often odd, or irritating, eccentric, damaged, difficult. That along with enormous creativity come certain deficits in humanity or decency. ‘We are familiar with this trope in our business: Mozart, Van Gogh, Tarantino, Eminem,’ Streep added. Abigail Disney agreed with those sentiments too: 'But damn, he was hella good at making films and his work has made billions of people happy. There's no denying it. So there ya go. Mixed feelings up the wazoo.' Documentary-maker: Producer Abigail Disney has worked on films such as The Queen of Versailles and The Invisible War . Ten hours later the documentary producer, who has worked on such films as the Queen of Versailles, which was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance in 2012, posted on Meryl Streep's comments about her great-uncle again. 'I know he was a man of his times and I can forgive him, but Saving Mr Banks was a brazen attempt by the company to make a saint out of the man. A devil he was not. Nor an angel... So I say Brava Meryl.' The film in question, Saving Mr Banks starring Emma Thompson as P.L. Travers and Tom Hanks as Walt Disney, is about Disney's attempts to gain the screen rights adapt Mary Poppins into a film from Travers.","Abigail Disney, the grandniece of Walt Disney, said Meryl Streep's comments about her relative were right .

"Guus Hiddink has confirmed Ron Vlaar suffered a fresh calf injury scare during Holland's defeat to Mexico in Amsterdam on Wednesday night. Vlaar pulled up in the first half and was replaced by Lazio's Stefan de Vrij with the Aston Villa captain clearly in some distress. The new injury scare comes as a blow to both club and country, with Villa facing a fourth consecutive relegation battle and Holland needing their best and most influential players available after losing four of the last five games after finishing third at this summer's World Cup.

Despite Aston Villa's poor form Ron Vlaar's (right) showing in defence has attracted interest from other clubs . But in hopeful news for Villa, Hiddink confirmed it is not the same niggling recurrence of the calf injury that ruled out the former Feyenoord defender for 19 league games during the last three seasons for the club. Karim Rekik has been called-up to the squad to replace Vlaar, but the defender, on loan at PSV from Manchester City, only has one previous cap as a substitute in a 2-0 defeat by France. Hiddink confirmed on Wednesday night to Voetbal Primeur: 'It does not look good, Ron is having trouble with his calf. It's not the same place as last time that was totally different.' Holland sit third in Euro 2016 qualifying Group A with three points from three games, six points behind group leaders Iceland and Czech Republic. They face Latvia on Sunday in Amsterdam. Vlaar's contract is due to expire at the end of the season, and the 29-year-old been linked with a move to Arsenal and Manchester United, but contrary to reports from his agent the player has revealed he has had talks with Villa over an improved deal. Speaking to the Birmingham Mail earlier this week, Vlaar said: 'I have spoken to the gaffer (Paul Lambert) a few times (about a new deal), but that is it so far.'

"People often worry about things that go bump in the night and not what happens to our plants while we sleep. But that has been an ongoing problem for residents in Hornchuch, east London for the last year. That is until they captured a middle-aged man tugging up flowers by their roots. Scroll down for video . The man can be seen walking past and looking into the front garden in Hornchurch, east London . He is then seen leaning over the iron railing, separating the garden and the pavement and grabbing a plant . He then throws the torn up shrub back into the flower bed whilst looking to see if he has been spotted . Footage caught the man pulling up the shrubs, which included Laurels and Privets, and then throwing them back to the ground. A concerned resident set on solving the mystery installed CCTV cameras outside his home. It was after he fell victim to a string of criminal damage incidents in his garden and to his car. The footage was captured on Saturday, July 26 at about 1.50am and revealed a man tampering with his flowers. He walks further down the garden and pulls up another plant before tossing it back into the flowerbed .

"Wayne Rooney is set to win his 100th England cap against Slovenia on Saturday. But despite his haul and a stunning medal collection at Manchester United, debate still rages whether he is a true great of English football. Sportsmail's Three Wise Men - JAMIE CARRAGHER, JAMIE REDKNAPP and MARTIN KEOWN give their verdicts on a brilliant but turbulent career so far and reveal what they think the future holds for England's ninth centurion. Our Three Wise Men: (left-right) Jamie Carragher, Jamie Redknapp and Martin Keown . Carragher holds off Wayne Rooney at Old Trafford in 2010 - but the striker scored in Man United's 2-1 victory . Redknapp takes on Rooney during United's 2-1 win  that condemned Southampton to relegation in 2005 . Keown looks on as a frustrated Rooney protests during Everton's defeat at Arsenal in August 2003 . Q: What is your favourite Rooney memory in an England shirt? REDKNAPP: Probably his first tournament - Euro 2004. He was a boy in a man’s body: so strong, aggressive and raw. He took Europe by storm. He played with real joy, sprinkled with aggression. CARRAGHER: I have to go back to the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon 10 years ago. I will never forget being on the substitutes’ bench for the opening game against France and seeing the look of shock and panic on the faces of the French defenders faces when Wayne started bulldozing his way past them. KEOWN: His second goal against Croatia at Euro 2004, when he was one-on-one with the keeper. It looked like it was his 100th cap, not his first major tournament. He was so cool. Wayne Rooney powers past Zinedine Zidane during England's opening match of Euro 2004 . Rooney slots the ball home for his second goal against Croatia at Euro 2004 . Peter Shilton - 125 caps . David Beckham - 115 . Steven Gerrard - 114 . Bobby Moore - 108 . Ashley Cole - 107 . Bobby Charlton - 106 . Frank Lampard - 106 . Billy Wright - 105 . Q: 100 caps is a great achievement, but has Rooney been the player he could have been? CARRAGHER: After the European Championship, we all thought we had a future World Player of the Year in our ranks who would take England to glory. He was fearless and unplayable in that tournament, his impact was incredible. It hasn’t quite worked out the way we all thought but, listen: very few players get to the level of world’s best. There might not be an international trophy but he’s still had a phenomenal career. REDKNAPP: It is very difficult to criticise someone who has reached 100 caps. But we did expect more from him back then. He’s our most talented player in a long time but he hasn’t scored enough goals in major tournaments. He has just one goal in a World Cup. But he’s had an incredible career and is not the first great player to be better for their club than their country. He will probably admit it hasn’t always gone the way he’d have liked. KEOWN: When he arrived on the scene so young, we wondered if he’d be the greatest who has ever played for England. He is one of the greats but not the all-time great. Only at the last World Cup did he seem to be fit going into a major tournament. There is a feeling that he hasn’t quite lived up to expectations. But we were asking too much of him, especially at tournaments. Rooney (left) laughs as he sprints alongside Jack Wilshere (right) during England training on Friday . The striker encourages team-mates including Raheem Sterling (left) and Theo Walcott (centre) This strike against Uruguay in Sao Paulo in June remains Rooney's only goal at a World Cup finals . Rooney lifts the Premier League (2013), the Champions League (2008) and the PFA Player of the Year (2010) Q: Rooney will be England’s ninth centurion - who is your personal favourite? REDKNAPP: Bobby Moore, because he’s the only one who lifted the World Cup and my dad spoke about him in glowing terms. I love hearing my dad’s stories about him. Everything he did was so meticulous, he even ironed his underpants. KEOWN: I didnt see the 1966 team so I’d choose Steven Gerrard. I saw his brilliant raw material straight away. He was quiet at first and I enjoyed helping him when he first came into the squad. He was less confident than Frank Lampard and I wish had been captain for longer. CARRAGHER: I would have to choose Sir Bobby Charlton. He is the best player we have ever had, he remains our leading goalscorer and, as a member of the 1966 squad, his place in history has long since been secured. He was a truly world-class performer for club and country. Most importantly, he was a gentleman and remains so to this day.

Q: What does Rooney need to do to extend his England career? REDKNAPP: Just stay in the Manchester United team - then he’ll break Peter Shilton's caps record by a long way. He’s got a good chance of beating Shilton if he plays for another three to four years. If he doesn’t break it, it will be because of a horrible injury or a bizarre drop in form. KEOWN: Playing deeper for United and the education from Van Gaal will extend his career. He can ping long passes like Paul Scholes used to and still be a threat in the final third. He can do it better than Scholes as he has extra pace. CARRAGHER: Quite simply, he needs to keep scoring. There are very few players in the squad at the moment who look capable of scoring goals regularly at this level but Wayne always has the belief that he will go out and hit the target. If, for some reason, the goals begin to dry up, that is when questions about his performances and what he is contributing to the team will become more relevant.

"Guus Hiddink could find himself out of a job on Sunday night night - a mere 72 days after embarking on his second spell in charge of Holland. The former Chelsea manager has pledged to resign if his Dutch team - who finished third at the World Cup under Louis van Gaal just four months ago - lose to Latvia in Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifier here in Amsterdam. Hiddink guided Holland to the semi-finals of the 1998 World Cup during his initial tenure but his return has been far from happy with four defeats from five matches so far, including two qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Iceland.

And after Wednesday’s 3-2 home loss to Mexico in a friendly, Hiddink gloomily reiterated his promise made last weekend: ‘Yes, I will stand down if we lose to Latvia.’ Defeat to a team ranked No 99 in the world at the Amsterdam ArenA seems unthinkable but the Oranje are currently a pale imitation of the vibrant and free-flowing attacking force that blew away Spain and Brazil, among others, at the World Cup. This was exposed by Mexico on Wednesday, with Carlos Vela and Javier Hernandez cutting through a shaky defence with ease and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar profligate in front of goal. Hiddink, whose side sit third in qualifying Group A entering this year’s final round of matches, will try and rediscover that attacking verve against Latvia by partnering Huntelaar with Manchester United’s Robin van Persie, who is fully fit again.

"The families of Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have made a desperate plea to Indonesia's president to reconsider the pair's executions in light of the work they have done to improve the lives of fellow inmates. On Thursday, Chan's last ditch attempt at a clemency bid was rejected by President Joko Widodo , following Sukumaran's rejected bid in December, officially exhausting the  legal appeals against their death sentence for attempting to smuggle heroin into Australia. The decision comes as Australian media personalities, including Asher Keddie and Alan Jones, have joined the campaign initiated by artist Ben Quilty to request mercy from Indonesian authorities. Scroll down for video . The families of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran (seen as a child in picture above) are pleading for mercy . Quilty, who became a mentor and close friend of Sukumaran after he was jailed, has used his creative talents to create a powerful video in support of the pair. Claudia Karvan,  Missy Higgins Megan Washington, and  Andrew Denton are among those who have come forward to take part in the I Stand For Mercy video. 'The message is just for the boys to know there are people walking with them in this very dark time,' Quilty told news.com.au. The 41-year-old is trying to organise a candlelight vigil for the pair, to 'send a strong message to the men themselves and their families that there are a lot of prominent Australians in the arts, media and all parts of our community who are on their side.' 'I want the barristers to walk into that prison and tell the boys how many people are thinking of them and supporting them,' he said. The relatives of Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, said they were devastated to hear the decision about the clemency bids, and pleaded for the president to visit the pair in Kerobokan Jail. Australian media personalities, including Asher Keddie (above), have joined the campaign initiated by artist Ben Quilty to request mercy from Indonesian authorities . Megan Washington (above), and Andrew Denton are among those who have come forward to take part in the I Stand For Mercy video . Raji Sukumaran, Myuran's mother, said that she was 'sure he would not have the heart to order them to be executed' if he saw their efforts towards reforming themselves and every aspect of the running of the jail. Mrs Sukumaran told The Sydney Morning Herald that she was confident that if the president could see how much they had changed he would put a stop to the executions, which have been scheduled to happen this year. The pair have been on death row since 2006, and could face death as early as next Sunday under a crackdown by the Indonesia government on drug cases. Their families said that they were at a loss to deal with a prison system that was not structurally built to recognise the efforts of prisoners to reform themselves, but hoped that this would change. Brian Brown joins other Australian media personalities in showing support for Chan and Sukumaran . Richard Roxborough has also joined the I Stand For Mercy Campaign . Ranjini Sukumaran, the mother of Bali Nine ringleader Myuran Sukumaran, said that he is a different person . Myuran's younger brother Chinthu Sukumaran said that Indonesian authorities needed to actually visit the prison to see the changes that had occured. 'Everyone who goes in there and spends a couple of minutes, they are just very impressed,' he said. The pair have dedicated much of their time to advocating against the very illegal activity that landed them in jail- drugs. Chan and Sukumaran have also instigated tertiary courses in computer studies, arts, English, and graphic design. Sukumaran is only a year away from completing his Bachelor of Fine Arts through Monash University, and along with Chan has aided the introduction of cooking, philosophy and psychology lessons and a first aid course. Bali locals have made a show of support, coming out to buy Sukumaran's art in the wake of his rejected clemency appeal.

Chinthu Sukumaran (far left), Michael Chan (left), Ranjini Sukumaran (right) and Brintha (far left) speak to journalists about their desperate plea to have their family members freed . His mother made an emotional appeal on Saturday, speaking of how sorry her son was and how much he had changed as an individual. 'No mother should have to go through this, it's killing us. Please, something has to be done, please help,' Channel Seven reported Mrs Sukumaran as saying. Mrs Sukumaran said that she was 'terrified'. 'I've been told my son will be taken out and shot at any time. I don't know what to do. He doesn't deserve to die.' The Australians may only be given several days notice if scheduled for execution, facing the imminent possibility of their death following the recent increase in criminal executions after a five year respite. They have been informed that when they are executed they will face the firing squad together for their plot to smuggle over 8 kilograms of heroin into Australia. 'He was only a teenager,' said Michael Chan, who is planning to fly over to see his brother in the next few days. 'He was only a teenager,' said Michael Chan, who is planning to fly over to see his brother in the next few days . Mrs Sukumaran made an emotional appeal on Saturday, speaking of how sorry her son was . Mrs Sukumaran said that she was 'terrified' for her son . 'There are no words that would make it better, [it's] just to be there with him,' he said. Prime Minister Tony Abbott spoke to both men's families on Friday and said the Australian government was 'continuing to make every possible effort' to stop the executions. Mrs Sukumaran did not comment on what's being done to try to save her son but said she had full confidence in the Australian government. 'I'm not giving up and I know the Australian government will do everything it can to bring the boys home or even to stop the execution,' she said. 'They can't do this to them.' Andrew Chan's brother Michael said he was not giving up hope because 'there are things that are being done' that would remain 'behind closed doors'. But the reality of his 31-year-old brother's fate was hitting home. 'The last couple of days have probably been worse for wear,' he said. 'I don't think I've felt this way, probably, since the beginning when it first all happened. But to know that we're sort of nearing the end of the road is heartbreaking.' Chan and fellow inmate Myuran Sukumaran have been on death row since 2006 . Sukamaran's mercy plea was rejected by the Indonesian government on December 30th . Mr Abbott (with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, left) said earlier this month that his government would make 'the strongest possible representations' to Indonesia to seek a stay of execution . Despite Indonesian President Joko Widodo vowing not to grant pardons for drug smugglers, the attorney-general's spokesman, Tony Spontana, said earlier in the week that there was a chance for the executions to be delayed. 'But with regards to death penalty, we have the mechanism to review the decision,' Mr Spontana said. 'Starting from the decision made by the District Court all the way to decision in Judicial Review, including the clemency decision,' reported The ABC. If Chan and Sukumaran are executed under the same conditions that previous inmates have faced, they will be taken from their cells at midnight to face their death with their hands and feet shackled. The pair will be offered blindfolds to wear, and will have white aprons around their neck and a red target on their chest. Julian McMahon, the pair's Australian lawyer, said that executions were 'not clean killings', and that prisoners may be tied to a plank before being shot. Chan was arrested at the age of 21 for his role in the Bali Nine drug smuggling ring . 'If the prisoner isn’t dead straight away, the commanding officer is meant to walk up and then put a bullet in the head,' Mr McMahon said. Mr McMahon said that Sukamaran and Chan were traumatised by their impending execution, and often dreamed of being shot in the heart by the prison's firing squad. Sukamaran and Chan attended school together at Homebush Boys High School in Sydney's west, and Chan said the pair had been relying on each other in an attempt to 'trying to stay strong for our family and friends at this difficult time.' 'It is hard to think that our lives are in the hands of two men - Tony Abbott and Joko Widodo - who have the power to grant life and death - please pray for a change of heart for these men and for our families,' he wrote in comments passed onto the Facebook page Friends of Andrew Chan. Mr McMahon labelled the potential executions 'chilling', and said that he could not fathom simply taking prisoners outside and shooting them. 'It seemed impossible to be true that they would take out these people on the weekend and just shoot them. That was my first reaction,' Mr McMahon said. News of the looming executions has galvanised Australians seeking clemency for Chan and Sukumaran, with 2,500 signatures on a petition begging Indonesian president Joko Widodo for mercy on their behalf.

"The city that claims to be 'overwhelmingly united' in its bid for the 2024 Games banned its employees from speaking badly about the Olympics, according to a signed agreement. Boston Mayor Martin J Walsh privately signed a deal with the United States Olympic Committee last year that included a section prohibiting city employees from criticizing the Olympics. The agreement, obtained by the Boston Globe through a public records request, also protects the USOC and the International Olympic Committee from written or spoken criticism. Watch your mouth: Boston Mayor Martin J Walsh privately signed a deal with the United States Olympic Committee last year that included a section prohibiting city employees from criticizing the Olympics . 'I think on its face it’s unconstitutional,' said Sarah Wunsch, staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. 'What’s wrong with this decree is that it has no limits,' she added. 'It doesn’t say you have the right, as a citizen, to speak on matters of public concern.' Speaking about the agreement, Walsh said that no city employees would be punished for speaking their mind about the Olympics outside of work. 'If a city employee isn’t happy and on their own personal time goes to Facebook or Twitter or any other social media, that’s fine,' Walsh said. Asked why he signed the document, the mayor claimed the clause was 'boilerplate' language and said 'we had to get the agreement signed.' The New York Times reports that the city's presentation claimed Boston was 'overwhelmingly united in its bid for the 2024 Games,' though a poll conducted for NPR affiliate WBUR spoke otherwise. Choice: Boston beat out Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington to be the US's entry for a bid to host the 2024 Olympic Games . Big plans: Most structures would be built within a six-mile zone in the city, making much of the Games 'walkable' The poll, conducted by The MassINC Polling Group, found only 50 percent supported the Olympics bid outright, with 33 percent opposed. 75 percent of those polled said they wanted to hold a referendum on the city's bid for hosting the Games, something that Walsh has stated he did not think was necessary. Boston beat out Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington to be the US's entry for the 2024 Games. It is not clear whether indecision among the city's residents would imperil the USOC's choice. Surrounding cities in the Boston area were also cool on the idea of bringing the Olympics, and crowds of fans, to the region. The City Council in Cambridge, where some events would be staged across the river north of Boston, told officials last month not to devote time or resources to help plan the Games. Councilman Timothy Toomey, who put forth the measure, labelled the notion of a Boston Olympic Games 'insane.'","Mayor Martin J Walsh privately signed a deal with the United States Olympic Committee that barred city workers from badmouthing the Games .

"Islamic State has released a video purporting to show the militant group beheading 21 . Egyptian Christians kidnapped in Libya. The video, released this afternoon, shows ISIS fighters dressed head to toe in black, marching the captives, all wearing orange jumpsuits, to a beach. The 21 men can be seen being forced onto their knees before they are beheaded by the militants standing behind them . Scroll down for video . Horror: A new video has been released by ISIS allegedly showing the beheading of 21 Egyptian men . The extremely graphic video first appeared on the Twitter feed of a website that supports Islamic State. A caption on the five-minute video read: 'The people of the . cross, followers of the hostile Egyptian church.' Before the killings, one of the militants stood with a knife . in his hand and said: 'Safety for you crusaders is something you . can only wish for.' Egypt has vowed to avenge the brutal murders, which  have been condemned around the globe, including by British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond. Mr Hammond said in a statement: 'I strongly condemn the murders of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians by ISIL-affiliated extremists in Libya. My thoughts are with the families of those killed. Terrorists: The extremely graphic video first appeared on the Twitter feed of a website that supports ISIS . 'Such barbaric acts strengthen our determination to work with our partners to counter the expanding terrorist threat to Libya and the region. 'Acts of terrorism should not be allowed to undermine Libya's political transition. 'We remain fully supportive of the UN's efforts to build a national unity government for Libya and to bring a political solution to the ongoing security crisis. 'Those who support terrorists can have no part in this process.' Earlier tonight, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said that Egypt reserved the right to respond in a way it sees fit to the Islamic State's beheading of 21 Egyptians in neighbouring Libya. Sisi warned Cairo would choose the 'necessary means and timing to avenge the criminal killings'. 'These cowardly actions will not undermine our determination' said el-Sissi, who also banned all travel to Libya by Egyptian citizens. 'Egypt and the whole world are in a fierce battle with extremist groups carrying extremist ideology and sharing the same goals.' The Coptic Church in a statement called on it followers to have 'confidence that their great nation won't rest without retribution for the evil criminals.' Helpless: Images emerged on Saturday, allegedly showing ISIS militants executing two men accused of spying for the Syrian government . Militants in Libya had been holding the 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians hostage for weeks, all laborers rounded up from the city of Sirte in December and January. The makers of the video identify themselves as the Tripoli Province of the Islamic State group. Libya has seen a rise of powerful armed militias in the wake of the downfall and death of dictator Muammar Gaddafi in the 2011 NATO-backed uprising. Tens of thousands of Egyptians work in Libya, mainly in the construction sector, and they have been targeted as the country has descended into chaos. The killings raise the possibility that the Islamic militant group - which controls about a third of Syria and Iraq in a self-declared caliphate - has established a direct affiliate less than 500 miles from the southern tip of Italy. One of the militants in the video, speaking English, makes direct reference to that possibility, saying the group now plans to 'conquer Rome.' Yesterday, images emerged of ISIS militants publicly executing two alleged spies and mercilessly crucifying another to a road sign in the Syrian city of Al-Bab. On Thursday, the extremist group announced it was holding an Israeli-Arab who posed as foreign a fighter to spy for the country's intelligence agency, Mossad.","New ISIS video allegedly shows beheading of 21 Egyptian Christians .

Jerry Hayes, who was the Conservative MP for Harlow from 1983 until 1997, blasted Mr Grayling, who is also Lord Chancellor, as 'off his trolley'. Mr Hayes, who resumed his career as a barrister in criminal law after losing his seat, launched the vitriolic tirade on his blog, criticising Mr Grayling's reforms to the judicial review process which are set to become law. Scroll down for video . Former Tory MP Jerry Hayes, left, launched the scathing attack on Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling, right, in response to his controversial reforms to the judicial review process . Mr Grayling believes judicial review could be used by campaigners to disrupt government and blackmail public bodies. But Mr Hayes blasted him as 'incompetent and a disgrace', adding judicial review is part of 'the rule of law' - but Mr Grayling believes it is 'the wicked work of smelly socked swampy types'. He wrote: 'If we were not a few weeks away from an election Chris Grayling would have been ventilated from office. 'The man is incompetent and a disgrace. 'His department has been judicially reviewed so many times and spend so much time in the High Court that it is amazing that they haven't put in a right to buy. It is not surprising that he wants to limit it.' Mr Hayes, pictured at a Tory conference in Blackpool in his MP days, said: 'After the election when Cameron returns to Downing Street Grayling is a s*** which will have to be flushed' Describing Mr Grayling as 'gothically comic', he said: 'If your kid has been deprived of a school place, or some dreadful development has suddenly appeared out of nowhere and the government hasn't obeyed the rules laid down by Parliament you can toddle of the the High Court and try and persuade a senior judge that you are not being vexatious or frivolous. 'And it is a rigorous sifting process. We call it the rule of law. But according to Grayling all this is the wicked work of smelly socked swampy types. Bloody lefties. 'The rule of law, like freedom is so precious that it has to be rationed.' Mr Hayes also highlights criticism of the reforms by former chief justices and former Tory cabinet ministers, as well as by the law lord Lord Pannick, who said Mr Grayling's remarks on judicial review 'demean' his office. He concludes: 'After the election when Cameron returns to Downing Street Grayling is a s*** which will have to be flushed.' A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: 'It is crucial that judicial review continues to hold authorities and others to account for the right reasons. 'It should not be abused by people to cause delays or to generate publicity for themselves or their organisations at the expense of taxpayers. 'Our reforms will bring balance to the judicial review system so justice is done, but unmerited, costly and time-wasting applications no longer stifle progress.'","Jerry Hayes was the Conservative MP for Harlow from 1983 until 1997 .

"Broadside: Bill Maher, pictured on the show Friday night, said audiences like American Sniper because it has no nuance and a 'psychopath' hero . It has become the runaway success of this round of Hollywood releases - but Bill Maher thinks American Sniper is only cleaning up at the box office because audiences lap up its 'psychopath' hero. The talk show host characterized the film as a blast of patriotism which made movie-goers feel good about the war in Iraq - then laid into the character of protagonist Chris Kyle. Maher, speaking on his HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher, drew on excerpts from the autobiography Kyle wrote before he was killed in February 2013, in which he said he enjoyed war and referred to his targets as 'savages'. He chose parts of the book, also called American Sniper, where Kyle said 'I love killing bad guys - even with the pain I loved what I was doing.' Maher also quoted the line 'maybe war isn't really fun but I certainly was enjoying it', as well as a point at which he said 'I hate the damn savages', in reference to the at least 160 people he shot dead in his time as a Navy SEAL. The film, directed by Clint Eastwood, was then compared with Hurt Locker, another film centered on the Iraq war which made far less money, though won widespread praise. Maher said: 'Hurt Locker' made $17million because it was a little ambiguous and thoughtful... [American Sniper] is just ""American hero! He's a psychopath patriot, and we love him.""' The movie has prompted rows across the board, with figures as diverse as Seth Rogen and Sarah Palin piling in either to defend or lambast the feature and its protagonist. Blockbuster: The film, shown above starring Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle, has stirred up controversy . 'Psychopath patriot - and we love him': Maher was uncompromising in his criticism of Kyle - and seized . Rogen compared American to a Nazi propaganda film in Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds - but later backtracked and said he didn't mean to make a political statement, only to point out that both segments featured snipers. Meanwhile Palin took Hollywood figures, including Rogen and Farenheit 9/11 director Michael Moore, to task for what she saw as their disrespect for an American hero. She wrote: 'Hollywood leftists: while caressing shiny plastic trophies you exchange among one another while spitting on the graves of freedom fighters who allow you to do what you do, just realize the rest of America knows you're not fit to shine Chris Kyle's combat boots.' The controversies do not appear to have harmed the fortunes of the film, which brought in $107million on its first weekend and has earned six Academy Awards nominations.

"Two paramedics are being hailed as heroes after they saved the life of a 70-year-old airline passenger whose heart stopped beating during a United Airlines flight to Texas and Florida. Donovan George, 32, and Alex Van, 53, were traveling on Flight 333 from John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, to Houston when they noticed an elderly man stand up. The passenger, who had started to move uncomfortably and was clearly 'in distress', complained that he was feeling light-headed and dizzy. Seconds later, he collapsed in Mr Van's arms. 'He was really pale in color and he was sweating profusely,' said Mr Van, who works in urban search and rescue alongside Mr George. 'I asked him if he was OK, and he collapsed into my arms.

'I started noticing that he's not breathing, he does not have a pulse. I immediately started CPR .' The paramedics, who were headed to Houston with their service canines for a Federal Emergency Management Agency search-and-rescue conference, hooked the man up to an IV. Then, using an auto-external defibrillator provided by the flight crew, they worked frantically to save his life, Orange County Fire Authority Captain, Steve Concialdi, told ABC News. After several minutes, the pensioner, who was flying home to Florida via Houston, came round and regained all his vital signs, sparking a round of applause from fellow passengers. The plane was swiftly diverted to Phoenix, Arizona, where the man was taken to a hospital. Thanks to the paramedics' actions, he is now alert and talking, the Orange County Register reported.

One of the commentators said that the man appeared to be quite nervous. 'Was it because it [the proposal] was inside the stadium or because she might have said no?' he asked. 'It was not long ago that Djokovic was in a similar situation,' the commentator said. The 27-year-old Serbian-born sportsman exchanged vows with Jelena Ristic in the grounds of Montenegro's Aman Sveti Stefan resort in July.

"Gunfire erupted during a crowded party in a vacant house in Omaha early Saturday, leaving three people dead and five wounded, and most witnesses refusing to help investigators, according to police. As many as 50 people were in and around the small home when shots were fired 'by multiple shooters' around 2 a.m., Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer said. No arrests have been made, and police said they were confident the shootings were gang-related. The vast majority of people at the scene refused to help police, the chief said during a news conference Saturday evening. He said he understood witnesses' fear but pleaded for them to come forward. Killed: 19-year-old mother-of-one Ja'Kela Foster (left) was shot dead at the house party on Saturday morning . 'Now that you are away from that scene and have opportunity to be away from any intimidation, I'm asking you for the sake of the community to contact law enforcement,' Schmaderer said. Police said 19-year-old JaKela Foster and 24-year-old Latecia Fox were declared dead at the scene, while 26-year-old Cameron Harris died several hours later. Schmaderer said it's unclear if any victims were intended targets or bystanders. Foster's mother, Kristina Young, waited for hours outside the small, tan house in the city's northeast side while investigators gathered evidence. She said she wasn't going to leave until the body of her daughter was taken away. Young said her boyfriend got a call from an aunt shortly before 2 a.m. telling him there was a shooting that may have involved Foster, who had a 1-year-old son. She said a friend later called to say Foster had been shot. Young said her daughter knew the person throwing the party. She said she asked her daughter not to go, knowing there would be drinking and worried there could be violence. 'I've been in Omaha long enough to know generally what happens at these parties,' she said. She said her daughter agreed and told her she was going elsewhere Friday night, but that she apparently went to the party anyway. Family: Foster leaves behind a one-year-old son (pictured), her mother Kristina Young (right) told reporters . Tragic: Foster (pictured with her son) was planning on going elsewhere on Friday but ended up at the party . 'To the person who pulled the trigger, I want to say it's just senseless. It just needs to stop. I now have a 1-year-old grandson that has no mother,' Young said while fighting back tears. The five people who were wounded were identified as Adrelet Bush, 25; Treveon Lillard, 20; Trenelle Miller, 21; Johnny Tiller, 21; and Jordyn Zyla, 20. Schmaderer said they were in stable condition late Saturday afternoon, though other details about their conditions weren't released. Police were investigating whether the shooting was related to another shooting that happened just blocks away about four hours earlier that injured a man and a woman. Schmaderer said that shooting was also gang-related. Douglas County property records list the home as belonging to Alonzetta Stevenson. A phone number for Stevenson at the Parker Street address was disconnected. Dorothy Wayne, who lives across the street from the home, said she and her husband were asleep when a shot passed through the wall of their front bedroom and lodged in the far wall. Neither was hurt. Danger: Foster's mother said she warned her daughter not to go to the house party earlier that day . Also wounded: Three people were taken by ambulance to Nebraska-Medicine-University of Nebraska Medical Center, with all three believed to have died . 'I just immediately hit the floor,' Wayne said. 'I'm just glad we weren't hurt.' Much of Omaha's violent crime happens in the area, but Wayne said she was surprised by the shootings because it's always been a quiet street. 'There are mostly old people on our block,' she said. Police arrested two people on suspicion of disorderly conduct at the hospital following the shooting, police said. Officers were called to the hospital after a disturbance among victims' relatives who had gathered at the hospital erupted.","Two women in their 20s were shot dead in shooting at 2am on Saturday .

"The Government has been hit by a new data security scandal after a secret file on the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan by police went missing. A computer disk containing details of the case which triggered Britain's worst riots in a generation is thought to have been lost in the post by the Ministry of Justice. Scotland Yard confirmed it was looking into the case – and had taken action over the potential security implications. Scroll down for video . Violence: The death of Mark Duggan in 2011 sparked a wave of riots, arson and looting across the UK . According to some sources, the file may contain the name of the policeman who killed Duggan, as well as the identities of other officers involved. None of the officers has been identified since Duggan died four years ago and the Met would not confirm or deny if their names were on the disk. Jurors at the inquest into Duggan's death – who cleared police of killing him unlawfully – were also granted anonymity, and it is possible their details were also on the disk. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has ordered an investigation to try to find out how the disk vanished – and to find it. Britain's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner, is also examining the case. On August 4, 2011, Duggan was in a minicab travelling through North London when the vehicle was stopped by police. The 29-year-old was in the feared Tottenham Man Dem gang and although he only had relatively minor convictions for cannabis possession and handling stolen goods, police feared he was out to avenge the death of a cousin, and so put him under surveillance. Shot dead: Mark Duggan was in a minicab travelling through North London when the vehicle was stopped by police . Duggan is said to have brandished a firearm at officers before running off and was shot twice, dying from a gunshot wound to the chest. A pistol was found wrapped in a sock up to 20ft from his body, over a fence. Two days later, relatives of Duggan, accompanied by local residents, marched on Tottenham's police station, demanding answers about the killing. After a confrontation with riot officers, cars and buses were torched. Looting then began as police stood back and over the next two days the disorder spread across the country, leading to five deaths and £200million of damage. More than 1,400 rioters were later jailed. Investigations into the case were also dogged by controversy. The Independent Police Complaints Commission admitted it had given false information to journalists in the wake of the killing, while Scotland Yard apologised for not telling Duggan's family about his death straight away. Police involved in the shooting refused to be questioned by the IPCC, giving written statements instead, while an inquest was delayed. When it finally began in September 2013, firearms officers were allowed to give their evidence anonymously but were repeatedly challenged about their version of the events. The policeman who fired the fatal shots – identified only as V53 – told how he and his colleagues surrounded Duggan with their guns, and said that he had 'an honest belief he was going to shoot me'. He said it was 'complete rubbish' to say Duggan was not armed when he was shot. Another officer – called V59 in the hearings – said it was 'highly offensive' to claim that police had planted a gun at the scene. The inquest jury returned a verdict of lawful killing on January 8 last year, sparking fresh fury from campaigners. In a later report, coroner Keith Cutler said the police had 'created a perception of collusion' by meeting to discuss their statements after the killing. The scene of the shooting in North London in August 2011. Investigations into the case were dogged by controversy . In October, Duggan's family lost an appeal against the inquest verdict, but at least one Met officer – codenamed ZZ46 – is facing disciplinary action, for not stopping Duggan from obtaining a gun from a supplier. The precise circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the disk have not been revealed but a Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'We have carried out a full risk assessment on the material that we have been informed was on the disk, and have taken the necessary steps. Due to the nature of the material, we are not prepared to discuss what those steps entail. 'The Metropolitan Police Service has offered its full support in attempting to locate the disk.' The Information Commissioner's Office said: 'We are aware of the case and we are making enquiries.' It could be one of the most serious Government data losses since October 2007, when two disks containing the personal details of about half the country's population went missing. Junior staff at HMRC offices in Washington, Tyne and Wear, sent the disks by unregistered post to the National Audit Office but they never reached their destination, prompting then Chancellor Alistair Darling to announce the loss in the Commons, to gasps from MPs. A Government spokesman said: 'We take all issues relating to data handling seriously. 'As such, an immediate investigation has been launched and all necessary steps are being taken. 'It would be inappropriate to comment further until that investigation has taken place.'","Computer disk containing details of Mark Duggan case has gone missing .

"A British woman who travelled to Syria with her young son before escaping an ISIS stronghold has begged her father to take her home after describing life with the jihadists as 'hard'. Tareena Shakil, 25, ran away to the war-torn country last October after telling relatives she was going on holiday to Spain with her 17-month-old son Zaheem. However, the TOWIE fan said life in the ISIS-held city of Raqqa was 'hard' and she escaped back across the Turkish border after, she claims, the militants tried to force her into marrying a one-legged fighter. Now Shakil, from Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, has asked her father for forgiveness and begged him to 'please take me home,' after being told she could potentially be sent back to Syria and into the clutches of the terrorist group. Scroll down for video . Tareena Shakil, 25, (left) who fled to Syria to join ISIS with her toddler son Zaheem (together right) before changing her mind and escaping to Turkey, has now begged her father to free them from a detention centre . Shakil fled back across the Turkish border with her 17-month-old son Zaheem after ISIS tried to force her into marriage, she claims. She fled to Syria in secret in November after telling family she was going on holiday . The mother and her son are currently being held in a Turkish detention centre, and the pair met with Shakil's father in an emotional two-hour reunion yesterday. According to The Sun, the psychology graduate wept to her father as she said: 'Take me home, dad – please take me home. Get me out of here.' Mohammed, her 42-year-old father, has previously told how his daughter was a one-time Spice Girls fan, a school prefect and Girl Guide and was so fascinated with ITV reality show The Only Way Is Essex that she travelled 150 miles to buy clothes at a shop run by one of its stars. He apparently promised his daughter during their reunion that he would 'not leave without her'. Shakil fled to Syria, to join ISIS militants, in secret after telling her family she was going on holiday to Spain. However, she changed her mind about staying in the stronghold after a few days and desperately tried to flee. She told The Sun: 'I hated it. I tried to escape within a few days of getting there. It wasn't what I thought it would be. 'Life is so hard there. There's no hot water, no electricity for hours on end, none of the comforts we are used to in Britain. 'I escaped death so many times. There were bombs coming down on the street where I lived every night. The house would shake. I didn't know if I was going to live or die.' After fleeing her Staffordshire home in November, Shakil entered Syria through the Turkish border. She has since returned to Turkey after describing life in the ISIS-held city of Raqqa as 'hard' and claiming she 'hated it' Shakil, a fan of The Only Way Is Essex, said she 'didn't know if she was going to live or die' during her time in Syria. Pictured: The residential street she lived on in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, before she fled to ISIS . Her brother Tareem, 22, previously told how the family hadn't suspected anything about her escape to Syria, and only found out when she contacted home to say she was at the border. He said: 'She sent us messages saying she'd gone over for a new life, that she had been radicalised. 'She said she wanted to live in the way of Allah. She was promised a good life with a good husband. She wanted to live under Sharia law. 'But it wasn't like that. Then she was texting saying she might not make it back. She was messaging, 'Please help me, I made a stupid mistake. Please Dad, will you come here and get me?' He was planning to go out there, but she made the escape herself.' Her escape saw her dash through a no-man's land near the Turkish-Syrian border, where snipers on the Turkish side did not fire at her. She then scrambled over a barbed wire fence, injuring her feet but somehow keeping young Zaheem unharmed. A Foreign Office source has previously said that Shakil will be questioned over possible terror offences and sent on a course to be 'de-radicalised' if she is sent back to Britain. She is one of more than 500 Britons who are believed to have travelled to join the extremist group in Iraq and Syria. Europol revealed this week that there could be up to 5,000 people from European countries in total who have fled to join the militants. Fears of a terrorist attack on Britain's streets have heightened in response to the threat of returning fighters and in the wake of shootings in Paris, including at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.","Tareena Shakil, 25, fled to Syria with 17-month-old son Zaheem to join ISIS .

"Murder suspect: Raymond Zimmerman allegedly fled an Ohio hospital then took a 70-year-old hostage . A 17-year-old murder suspect who fled from police allegedly kidnapped an elderly woman, assaulted her, then made her drive him to his hideout in an apartment building. Raymond Matthew Zimmerman, who was being held at a hospital in Springfield, Ohio, was seen fleeing in his orange jumpsuit without any shoes on after being treated for an ankle injury which authorities now suspect was faked. After fleeing Friday night, police say Zimmerman, who is accused of murdering his uncle, sneaked to the house of the unnamed 70-year-old in the early morning. They then say he broke in, attacked her, then forced him to drive him away. According to local station WDTN, Zimmerman had hid in her house all night and changed clothes before kidnapping her. The alleged victim told police that he had held her hostage, then forced her to take him to an apartment block in the neighboring town of Ohio before letting her go. Police later tracked him down to the block, and arrested him around two hours after the alleged kidnapping. According to the woman's partner, Zimmerman arrived halfway through an 8:30am phonecall in which he warned her to be on the lookout for him. A police report said the man, halfway through arranging a breakfast meeting, mentioned the fleeing prisoner, only to be met with the response 'he is here' and a dead phone line. The report said there were signs of a struggle at her home - and a missing car. The woman returned while police were investigating - and officers say she had obviously been assaulted. Captured: Zimmerman was caught at a block of apartments in Fairborn, Ohio, near to where the allegedly captured woman had taken him . After giving her testimony, the woman was sent to hospital to be treated. Her injuries were not considered life-threatening. The Clark County sheriff's office and detention center pledged to work together to ensure 'such escapes never occur in the future'. Zimmerman had been in transit from Clark County Juvenile Detention Center for treatment of an ankle injury, which authorities now believe never really existed. According to a Clark County Sheriff's Department spokesman, Zimmerman made his escape after he had his handcuffs removed so he could use crutches. He and 18-year-old Robert V. Winbush, of Fairborn, were arrested last week in connection with the shooting death of William Henson, Zimmerman's uncle. Deputies found Henson's body in his home, which they said was robbed of 38 rifles, various other firearms and a large amount of ammunition. Besides the earlier murder charge, Zimmerman now faces felony charges of escape, aggravated burglary, kidnapping and auto theft.","Raymond Zimmerman fled hospital on Friday night and 'hid in woman's .

"Selfridges believe shoppers no longer want to be limited by their gender (pictured is brand KTZ which the store says is increasingly popular with consumers wanting a more androgynous style) From Grace Jones' angular suits to David Bowie's androgynous costumes, fashion icons have never been scared to experiment with gender. Now Selfridges is launching 'gender-neutral' shopping to allow consumers to buy clothes without being restricted to men's or women's fashions. The Oxford Street department store has announced it will be axing its separate women and menswear  departments in favour of three floors of unisex fashion. It is also getting rid of its traditional mannequins. Selfridges  believe that shoppers no longer want to be defined or limited by their gender as to what they can wear. Instead they are able to shop for unisex or 'agender' clothing. 'We want to take our customers on a journey where they can shop and dress without limitations or stereotypes,' the store told The Times. 'A space where clothing is no longer imbued with directive gender values, enabling fashion to exist as a purer expression of 'self.'' Selfridges have launched five unisex collections and 'agender' pieces from forty of its regular brands. Beauty products and accessories for men and women will also be mixed. Brands at the store, such as KTZ, Trapstar and Hood By Air, are already popular with  women looking for a more androgynous style. While the unisex Boy London  saw a massive surge in popularity when singer Rhianna was seen sporting their range. It comes as Selfridges bosses say they have seen a huge surge in women buying menswear as part of the trends for looser clothing and more masculine tailoring this year. Several designers last year experimented with gender-neutral fashion while Vivienne Westwood's AW14 womenswear collection was inspired by androgynous pinup Tilda Swinton. And Eastie Empire, originally a menswear brand, has previously launched a gender neutral line after its designer Sara Weston said she noticed female clients were buying from the range. The Oxford Street department store has announced it will be axing its separate women and men's clothing departments in favour of three floors of 'gender neutral' shopping . Jane Shepper, chief executive of Whistles which has  collaboration with Swedish company Stutterheim to create unisex raincoats, said the line between men and womenswear was becoming blurred. 'A lot of our men's collection influences our women's and vice versa,' she added. Cos and Gap have all noticed increases in the number of women buying menswear, while men have also been picking up women's knitwear for themselves. While there has been a swathe of high-profile unisex models,  such as Elliott Sailors, who  work for both mens and womenswear brands.

"Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates spoke about the 'perverse' Immigration policies in the U.S. that force foreigners who were educated here leave the country to get jobs elsewhere. Gates, who spoke in Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum on Friday said that the U.S. still has a 'phenomenal' amount of technological innovation in our country. Gates also said that in order to keep the talent in America the U.S. needs to fix the immigration system to create jobs around Americans regardless of their country of origin. Scroll down for video . Change immigration: Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates spoke about the 'perverse' Immigration policies in the U.S. that force foreigners who were educated here leave the country . 'It is kind of perverse to provide the education and then, even somebody who’s being offered a very high-paying job, they’ve got to go to Canada or back to India,' Gates said Friday on Fox's 'Opening Bell with Maria Barroom.' Gates also said that in order to keep the future of technology in America the U.S. desperately needs to improve its education system. Gates mentioned that Common Core, a set of standards for kindergarten through high school, only creates a uniform curriculum that doesn't leave room for new knowledge. He said it also, 'doesn't constrain how teachers do things.' He emphasized that the U.S. needs set standards, 'that are high enough that we are competitive with other countries.' In addition to Immigration Gates spoke on healthcare in our country and how we spend so much more when compared to other countries. He said that the healthcare issue is not partisan, rather we should work as one to study why we are not working as efficiently as we could be. World Economic Forum: Melinda and Bill Gates attend a session at the Congress Center during the World Economic Forum annual meeting on January 23 in Switzerland . 'I’m afraid that we’ve been distracted from the issue of why we spend so much more than others,' he explained. 'This should be a technocratic thing, not a partisan thing, why this system is not working as efficiently as it could.' Bill gates and his wife Melinda released their annual letter on children's mortality rates and mobile banking as a tool for healthcare and the results are astonishing. Gates believes that children's mortality rates will be cut in rates by 2030 and that 82.5 billion people will have access to inexpensive financial services through mobile banking.

"Brown pelicans with slit throat pouches have been washing up this month in south Florida, triggering community outcry as authorities investigate what they suspect are serial slashings. About 10 birds have died, and another four were injured, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The culprit apparently used a knife to slit the large gullets beneath their beaks, spokesman Robert Dube said. Throat slasher: 10 brown pelicans on the Florida Keys have died after having their pouches slashed . It comes just over a year after an almost identical attack on the Florida Keys which saw dozens of birds wash up dead on the shore. The birds use the oversized pouches to swallow fish skimmed from the water. Once slashed, they can starve to death. 'It's a slow, agonizing death for these animals,' Dube said. The maimed pelicans have been turning up around the lower Florida Keys, located in the southernmost part of the state. State wildlife officers are seeking tips about the slayings, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is also investigating. While no longer endangered, brown pelicans are protected by state regulations and the U.S. Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Perpetrators can face fines and even jail time for harming the birds. Identical attack: Last year dozens of the birds were slain an injured by a serial throat slasher in Florida . Local residents have been offering reward money since officials issued an alert last week about the deaths. Wildlife officers suspect teenagers or irate fishermen could be behind the attacks. During winter months, the region also sees many part-time residents from northern states, Dube said. 'Right now we are at a loss,' he said. 'We love our critters down here in the Keys. It's caused a lot of concern.'","10 birds killed and another four injured by throat slashing attack .

"With a price tag of about £70million, this palatial villa on the French Riviera is beyond the reach of all but the wealthiest oligarchs. But while the sprawling 30-bedroom property in St Tropez has all the luxuries any billionaire would demand, Castle St Therese also has a unique place in history – as the spot where Princess Diana and Dodi Al Fayed started their romance. It was also where they began their final break together. They were photographed, apparently kissing, on a yacht that sailed from the villa a few days before the Paris car crash which killed them both. Scroll down for video . The main villa: The imposing nine-bedroom mansion at the estate's highest point, with terraces, a playroom and two kitchens . The final holiday: Diana and Dodi in St Tropez on August 22, 1997, nine days before they died . Mr Al Fayed and his Finnish-born second wife, Heini, first invited the Princess of Wales and her sons William and Harry to spend a holiday at the estate in July 1997, where they stayed in the guesthouse. The Egyptian-born tycoon also invited his 42-year-old son Dodi, whom the Princess barely knew, to join them. During this holiday, Diana and Dodi’s relationship blossomed, and over the following weeks the couple returned to the main villa twice on their own, staying there briefly before taking one of the family yachts for a cruise around the Mediterranean. On the second of these cruises, the couple were famously pictured embracing on the deck of the yacht. They then travelled on to Paris where they died on August 31 in a high-speed crash shortly after leaving the Ritz Hotel. Bath with a view: Jacuzzi, equipped with gold taps in the shape of swans, and a stunning terrace . Inviting pools: Two outdoor pools have stunning views over the bay. There's also an indoor pool . Insiders said the interiors of the St Tropez villa would hardly have changed since Diana was there nearly 18 years ago. A glossy brochure produced by estate agents Knight Frank for potential purchasers, which has been obtained by The Mail on Sunday, shows the property’s magnificent views across the bay from its secluded position in landscaped gardens dotted by trees. Neighbours have included Bernard Arnault, the owner of the Louis Vuitton luxury goods business. The four-acre site within the private community of Les Parc De St Tropez boasts a main villa with nine bedrooms, five of which are ensuite, large reception rooms, two kitchens, a children’s playroom, swimming pool and terraces. The estate also boasts a waterfront beach house with nine bedrooms, an indoor and outdoor pool, a nightclub with a cinema and a bar, and a gym and sauna. There is a boathouse large enough to accommodate a speedboat, with a roof terrace that doubles as a helipad, and a jetty where the Al Fayed yacht was often moored. In addition, the compound includes the four-bedroom guesthouse where Diana and her sons stayed, a security lodge and tennis court, plus staff accommodation. The grand hall: Impressive hall with its wide sweeping staircase. But fixtures and fittings will cost extra . Sleep well: An ornate en suite bedroom - one of 30 the villa boasts, including staff quarters . The property was built in the 1860s and was originally owned by Ferdinand de Lesseps, the developer of the Suez Canal. Although there is no asking price detailed in the discreet brochure, insiders said that a figure of £70 million was being mentioned. Knight Frank was last night unable to confirm this. Mr Al Fayed’s spokesman Michael Cole confirmed that the businessman had decided to sell the property as he had barely used it since his children had grown up. Mr Cole said: ‘Mr Al Fayed has given this a great deal of thought. It is a bittersweet moment for him.’ He added: ‘He and his family have happy memories of St Tropez over many years and will always remember the summer of 1997 with great happiness and, of course, with tremendous sadness and regret at the way it ended.’","Palatial Castle St Therese villa on the French Riviera is up for sale for £70m .

"Amjad Bashir, left, with Ukip party leader Nigel Farage, right, before his defection to the Tories . Nigel Farage was rocked last night as one of his Euro MPs defected to the Tories, saying: ‘Ukip is pointless.’ In a major coup for David Cameron, Amjad Bashir jumped ship less than a year after he was elected as a Ukip MEP. But last night, Bashir’s decision descended into a tit-for-tat battle between the parties. Just hours before news of his defection was due to be made public, Ukip announced they were ‘suspending’ him pending investigations into ‘extremely serious’ allegations. Bashir, a Pakistani-born businessman, has been one of the few . non-white faces in the senior ranks of Ukip and was used to rebut allegations of racism in the party. His defection comes four months after two Conservative MPs – Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless – quit to join Ukip. Now Cameron has turned the tables. It was one of several blows delivered to Farage’s Election hopes last night. First, a senior Ukip official admitted the party was chasing the votes of ‘bigots’. Party secretary Matthew Richardson – who, ironically, was hired to stamp out negative media stories about Ukip – said: ‘People talk about Ukip being bigots but there are hundreds of thousands of bigots in the United Kingdom and they deserve representation.’ Mr Richardson admitted making the remarks, but defended them as ‘the sort of chat people have with their mates while having a drink’. Then The Mail on Sunday learned that Ukip’s economic spokesman, Patrick O’Flynn, told a meeting in Hampshire that Right-wingers in Ukip are ‘away with the fairies’ – and that many egos in the party were ‘slightly out of control’. The comments by the pair, both close to Farage, will be seized upon as proof that the party is dominated by extremists. But it is the row over Bashir’s switch that could prove the most damaging. Ukip immediately went on the offensive against the Euro-MP, making allegations of unanswered financial and employment questions, and interference with the candidate selection process. Bashir dismissed the claims as ‘a crude attempt to smear me’. Writing in The Mail on Sunday, he said: ‘There is not a shred of truth in any of the claims but it has made me more convinced than ever that I made the right decision.’ Mr Bashir was suspended by Ukip over unanswered financial employment questions, it emerged on Saturday . Announcing his ‘suspension’, Ukip said: ‘The UK Independence Party has a zero-tolerance policy and takes the matters at hand extremely seriously. The allegations against Mr Bashir are of a grave nature and we will be forwarding our evidence obtained so far to the police. ‘Ukip will not tolerate anyone abusing their positions in the party as we have a firm commitment to differing ourselves from the existing political classes. As a result, Mr Bashir’s involvement with the party was suspended today with immediate effect pending further investigations.’ The news came after Bashir said he was defecting as he agreed with Cameron that a vote for Ukip could put Ed Miliband in No 10. Bashir said Cameron’s promises on immigration and an in-out referendum on Britain’s EU membership meant there was no longer a need for Ukip – and he suggested the party was essentially a platform for promoting Farage’s personal ambitions. Bashir, who has represented Yorkshire and the Humber since last May, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I entered public life to campaign for a referendum on Europe and a controlled immigration system. Mr Bashir, pictured centre to the right of party leader Nigel Farage, at the Ukip annual party conference. A party spokesman said evidence obtained by Ukip in its investigations had been forwarded to the police . ‘I joined Ukip because I thought it was dedicated to those goals. But I now realise that Ukip is more concerned with furthering its own interests as a political party than delivering for the British people. ‘I have come to the conclusion that it is only with David Cameron and the Conservatives that we can achieve a referendum on Europe, and an immigration system that works for Britain. A vote for Ukip will only deliver a Labour Government, which will deny people a referendum and control over our borders. I have done this with a heavy heart, but I feel I must do right by my country.’ The defection deal was brokered by Tory MEP Dan Hannan and sealed when Bashir met Cameron in the Prime Minister’s constituency office in Oxfordshire on Friday. Bashir, 62, was Ukip’s spokesman on small businesses. He moved to Bradford aged eight and spent 15 years as a member of the Conservative Party before switching to Ukip two years ago in protest at Cameron’s ‘modernising agenda’. He said of gay marriage in 2013: ‘It is a big mistake to meddle in an age-old institution.’ He also wanted to cut EU red tape and tighten border controls, saying: ‘We have to seriously restrict immigration to the people who can add value to our country.’ Last year it was revealed that a Manchester curry house run by Mr Bashir’s sons, Tayub and Mudassar, had been fined an undisclosed amount for employing illegal immigrants. A Ukip party source said Mr Bashir had been aware for some time that he was being investigated and suggested that the suspension was the reason for his defection . Amjad Bashir: 'I have decided to leave Ukip because it has become a vanity project for Farage' I have decided to leave Ukip because it has become a vanity project for Nigel Farage and because many of the criticisms made of the party are true. David Cameron famously said that Ukip was a party of ‘fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’. Certainly, I have experienced racism in Ukip. I have been racially abused on social media by other Ukip members who ask offensive questions like: ‘Are you a Muslim?’ I was angry when I was the only Ukip politician who was cut out of a video of speeches at a party event. I complained that it was because of my ethnic minority background, but was fobbed off. Some of the antics of Ukip MEPs are appalling. They make childish remarks during debates and are abusive towards MEPs from other countries when there is no call for it. I was outraged when I heard Mr Farage talk of a ‘fifth column’ of immigrants in Britain. I have worked hard all my life, and when my father came to this country he worked his socks off to provide for his family. It is an insult for him to talk in this way. I joined Ukip because I wanted a referendum on the EU and wanted better controls on immigration. But now I have no doubt that Mr Cameron will deliver on this, so, in my view, Ukip has outlived its usefulness. Mr Farage wants to use Ukip as a means for getting power for himself, and that is not what the party was set up to achieve. He has created a popularist image for himself as the jolly chap at the bar with a pint in his hand, but the reality is different. He runs the party like a dictator, employs people who are totally inappropriate for party positions and gets rid of anybody who stands in his way. Ukip is guided more by dogma than common sense. Since I became an MEP, I have been amazed that Ukip often votes against Britain’s national interest in the European Parliament. For example, we were told to vote against EU money for flood relief schemes in the UK because the money had come from Brussels. I protested that this was ridiculous because much of the EU money was British in the first place, but I was ignored. And Ukip’s reaction on finding out that I was going to join the Conservatives sums up what is wrong with them. They made a crude attempt to smear me with false allegations of irregularities in the recruitment of Asian members in Bradford. There is not a shred of truth in any of the claims but it has made me more convinced than ever that I made the right decision. There is no escaping one simple fact: when Mr Cameron said: ‘If you go to bed with Nigel Farage on Election night, you will wake with Ed Miliband the next day,’ he was telling the truth.","MEP Amjad Bashir said 'Ukip is pointless' before defecting to Tory party .

"Prince William likes to tackle meaty issues so he should be the perfect man for a new mission – selling British sausages to China. The country has an import ban on processed pork products, including bangers. But when the Prince opens the Great Festival of Creativity in Shanghai in March, he is being urged to champion British pig meat. When Prince Williams opens the Great Festival of Creativity in Shanghai in March he is being urged to champion British pig meat. He is pictured on a trip to Australia last year with wife Kate and baby son George . Overturning the ban could produce a £15 million a year fillip for UK farmers, with the potential for further gains. The fry-up is becoming popular among China’s middle classes, but the sausage is usually an American-style hot dog. China has recently relaxed its ban to allow the importation of non-processed pig products such as spare ribs and pork belly. The popularity of the Royals could drive British exports. If China overturning their ban on importing processed pork products, it could produce a £15 million a year fillip for UK farmers . One firm, Westaways Sausages in Devon, believes it could sell 500,000 sausages a week to China. Peter Hardwick, of the Agricultural and Horticultural Development Board, added: ‘We would love to sell sausages to China but it’s a long process.’ Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said: ‘There’s big excitement about the Duke’s visit. 'This is a big opportunity for us. 'The Chinese are focused on food safety and I’m pushing for more inspections so we can sell more pork.’ William’s spokesman said it was ‘too early’ to discuss the visit.","Prince William is to open Great Festival of Creativity in Shanghai in March .

"British actress Julie Walters has waded into the class row between popstar James Blunt and Labour MP Chris Bryant . Julie Walters has claimed that working-class children 'aren't represented' in the arts. The Hollywood actress, who was honoured with a BAFTA fellowship last year, branded it 'really sad' that youngsters from privileged backgrounds were enjoying all the breaks. The 64-year-old star of Mamma Mia, Harry Potter and Calendar Girls, appears to back the argument of the Shadow arts minister, Chris Bryant. The Labour MP claimed British culture was 'dominated' by stars like Blunt and Eddie Redmayne who went to expensive boarding schools. Harrow educated Blunt hit back calling the politician a 'classist gimp,' and 'prejudiced wazzock' who was using the 'politics of jealousy' to win votes. 'Working-class kids aren't represented,' Mrs Walters said in an interview with the Guardian Weekend magazine. 'It's really sad. 'I think it means that  we're going to get loads more middle-class drama. 'It will be middle-class people playing working-class people, like it used to be.' Mrs Walters, whose grew up in Staffordshire with her builder father and clerical assistant mother, was awarded a 'full grant' to study at Manchester Polytechnic. But she said she would fail to make it today because she would not be able to go to college. After finishing college Walters went onto start her career at Liverpool's Everyman Theatre, working with the likes of Alan Bleasdale and Willy Russell in working-class drama. 'I don't know how you get into it now,' Ms Walter, who was Oscar-nominated for her turn, opposite Michael Caine, in the 1983 film Educating Rita, told the newspaper magazine. She said that she doesn't 'know what to tell,' the kids that write to her asking for advice to break into acting. Mrs Walters, who won a BAFTA in 2010 for her performance as Mo Mowlam in Channel 4's Mo, reportedly said it was not just a problem for actors, but also writers. In his letter to Mr Bryant, Blunt claimed that the £30,000 a year boarding school he attended did nothing to help him break into the music industry. The  Brit award-winner also claims that people in the music industry tried to get him to change his accent so he sounded less posh. Blunt opened his letter to Mr Bryant by accusing him of being a 'classist gimp', despite the fact that the Labour MP himself was privately educated at £20,000 a year Cheltenham College before attending Oxford. Ms Walters, pictured above in the movie Calendar Girls, said that she 'doesn't know how,' people get into acting today . In Blunt's letter, he wrote: 'I happened to go to a boarding school. No one helped me at boarding school to get into the music business.' He added: 'I bought my first guitar with money I saved from holiday jobs (sandwich packing!). I was taught the only four chords I know by a friend. 'No one at school had ANY knowledge or contacts in the music business, and I was expected to become a soldier or a lawyer or perhaps a stockbroker. So alien was it, that people laughed at the idea of me going into the music business, and certainly no one was of any use.' Blunt said even in the army, which he joined after university, he was told that trying to become a pop star was a 'mad idea'. He wrote: 'And when I left the army, going against everyone's advice, EVERYONE I met in the British music industry told me there was no way it would work for me because I was too posh. One record company even asked if I could speak in a different accent. (I told them I could try Russian). Singer James Blunt, pictured left, branded Labour MP Chris Bryant, pictured right, a 'classiest gimp' after he attacked the number of posh actors and musicians . 'Every step of the way, my background has been AGAINST me succeeding in the music business. And when I have managed to break through, I was STILL scoffed at for being too posh for the industry.' He added: 'You come along, looking for votes, telling working class people that posh people like me don't deserve it, and that we must redress the balance. 'But it is your populist, envy-based, vote-hunting ideas which make our country crap, far more than me and my s*** songs, and my plummy accent. 'I got signed in America, where they don't give a stuff about, or even understand what you mean by me and 'my ilk', you prejudiced wazzock, and I worked my a*** off. 'What you teach is the politics of jealousy. Rather than celebrating success and figuring out how we can all exploit it further as the Americans do, you instead talk about how we can hobble that success and 'level the playing field'. 'Perhaps what you've failed to realise is that the only head-start my school gave me in the music business, where the VAST majority of people are NOT from boarding school, is to tell me that I should aim high. Perhaps it protected me from your kind of narrow-minded, self-defeating, lead-us-to-a-dead-end, remove-the-'G'-from-'GB' thinking, which is to look at others' success and say, 'it's not fair'.' Blunt signed off his letter: 'Up yours.' But Mr Bryant accused the pop star of being 'blooming precious'. In a letter in response, the MP wrote: 'I'm not knocking your success. I even contributed to it by buying one of your albums. I'm not knocking Eddie Redmayne, either. He was the best Richard II I have ever seen. 'If you'd read the whole of my interview, you'd have seen that I make the point that the people who subsidise the arts the most are artists themselves. Of course that includes you. 'But it is a statement of the blindingly obvious that that is far tougher if you come from a poor family where you have to hand over your holiday earnings to help pay the family bills.'","Julie Walters says that working-class kids 'aren't represented' in the arts .

"Nervous about flying? There's an app for that. A new app, called 'Am I Going Down?', calculates a plane's chances of crashing in an effort to put apprehensive passengers at ease. Created by London-based Vanilla Pixel, the app uses real flight statistics to analyse flight safety. A new app, called 'Am I Going Down?', shows just how unlikely it is that your plane will crash . If you're flying on a Boeing 777 Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong to Los Angeles, there's a one in 4,068,434 chance that your flight will go down en route. And even the most avid flyers have little to fear. According to the app, if you take a flight every day for the next 11,146 years, you are unlikely to experience even one incident. Developer Nic Johns spoke to MailOnline Travel about the app, explaining that it's meant to calm the fears of those who are uneasy when it comes to air travel. Developed by London-based Nic Johns, the app was initially created to allay the fears of nervous flyers . 'The original inspiration for Am I Going Down? comes from my wife (and co-founder of Vanilla Pixel), Julie,' he wrote in an email. 'Her fear of flying has always made travelling difficult, so I wanted to make an app that demonstrates - after entering airline, aircraft and flight details - that flying is in fact extremely safe. 'As a typical example, flying on a British Airways 747-400 from London to New York has a one in nine million chance of crashing... not quite as long odds as winning the National Lottery, but not far off.' More than 10 million routes have been assessed, using data from such sources as the Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives, the United States National Transportation Safety Board and the Civil Aviation Organisation. 'For my analysis, I only include crashes where there was at least one passenger fatality - which is the relevant stat for those with a fear of flying,' Johns explained to CNN. 'I then incorporate the volume of flights, weighted to the most recent, to provide the final ""one in a million"" statistics.' Users can select their plane, their destination and their departure information for a personalised analysis . Mr Johns has not included AirAsia on the list of airlines, in sensitivity to the recent tragedy . The release of the app, however, did come at a rather awkward time - just days after AirAsia flight QZ8501 went down. 'Admittedly, the timing of the release was unfortunate. I originally developed the app in February 2014, shortly before the first Air Malaysia crash,' he told MailOnline Travel. 'That crash caused me to rethink, so I put the app on hold to work on a few other things. 'I sent the final app to Apple for review in December, just two weeks before the AirAsia QZ8501 crash.' In response to the tragedy, Johns has temporarily removed AirAsia from the airline list, explaining that it will return in a later update. 'Despite all that, the reaction has been extremely positive so far - especially from those with a fear of flying,' he added. The 'Am I Going Down?' app is now available on iTunes and is currently only available for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. An Android version may be released in the future.","'Am I Going Down?' app uses real flight statistics to analyse flight safety .

"Doctors have urged medicine manufacturers to make sweet-tasting Calpol less appealing to children . With 12 million bottles sold each year, Calpol is a medicine cabinet staple in most homes, soothing childhood aches and pains thanks to its main ingredient – paracetamol. But now a leading doctor has warned that children could be at risk of accidental overdose from Calpol and other brightly coloured drugs that ‘look more like milkshake than medicines’. Doctors say that Calpol’s syrup-sweet strawberry taste and pink colouring also makes it ‘almost irresistible’ to some youngsters. ‘Some children go to alarming lengths to get their hands on it while their parents’ backs are turned,’ said one. Health professionals have now urged Calpol’s manufacturers to make the medicine less appealing to youngsters to prevent accidental overdose of paracetamol, which can cause serious liver damage and, in rare cases, prove fatal. The plea comes as figures obtained by The Mail on Sunday reveal nearly five children a day were admitted to hospital with accidental overdoses of over-the-counter painkillers in one year alone. Concerns have previously been raised that children are given too much paracetamol by GPs and parents who do not realise there are doses in other branded products, such as Lemsip. The Health and Social Care Information Centre statistics show that a staggering 1,691 children aged one to four were admitted to hospital in 2012-13 because of ‘accidental poisoning’ by medicines including non-prescription painkillers ibuprofen, paracetamol and aspirin. Although perfectly safe within the recommended doses, paracetamol is one of the easiest drugs on which to overdose. Unlike with other drugs, patients do not need much more than the advised amount before it starts to cause problems. A 2007 study found 84 per cent of babies are given Calpol in their first six months. The brand’s Infant Suspension Formula, suitable for babies aged two months and over, is pink and strawberry-flavoured, while the Six Plus formula is orange-flavoured and coloured. Doctors say that Calpol’s syrup-sweet strawberry taste and pink colouring also makes it ‘almost irresistible’ to some children, but it can be dangerous . Doctor and author Dr Max Pemberton warns that children could be getting ‘mixed messages’ on the potential dangers that lurk inside the bottles. ‘The introduction of child-proof tops and blister packs for pills mean it is harder for children to get hold of medicines these days, but these figures revealing the number of children admitted to hospital show that, sadly, some still do,’ he says. ‘With a medicine like Calpol, the bright packaging and appealing taste means a young child could mistake it for sweets. The purple packaging for the Infant Suspension reminds you of Cadbury’s chocolate, and the medicine itself looks more like milkshake. ‘How can we expect a child to understand that something that looks and tastes so nice actually has the potential to do harm if they have too much?’ Calpol is used to treat common childhood conditions including fever, earache and teething trouble. Official guidelines state babies aged between three and six months should be given no more than 240mg of paracetamol a day. That’s the equivalent of just two 5ml teaspoons of Calpol Infant Suspension formula. Infants aged six to 24 months can be given 5ml up to four times a day. Dr Pemberton has urged Johnson and Johnson, Calpol’s manufacturers, to rethink the formula – and its packaging. Nearly five children a day are admitted to hospital with accidental overdoses of over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol . ‘Paracetamol is an everyday painkiller but it has potential to cause serious harm, particularly to a child as their organs are less developed and more fragile,’ he says. Dr Sally Gibbs, an A&E consultant at Sheffield Children’s Hospital, says worried parents with children who have drunk over-the-counter medicines are a familiar sight in emergency departments. She adds: ‘Sometimes the child has climbed up to get it from the medicine cabinet, or the parents may not have put it properly out of reach or failed to make sure the top is on securely. Older siblings may give it to their little brother or sister. ‘Children may reach for Calpol as they recall having it before, and that it tastes nice.’ Online parenting forum Mumsnet contains posts from concerned parents whose children have obtained the medicine. One wrote: ‘I’ve just found a bottle of Calpol Six Plus open. They [the children] climbed up into the cupboard and managed to open the so-called child-proof lid. Half a bottle has gone.’ Public health nutritionist Dr Helen Crawley says she cannot understand why sweeteners such as sucrose are used to make Calpol more palatable when a spoonful of milk would help the medicine go down just as well. ‘The bright pink colour of Calpol could be related to overdose in children who are picking it up and think it’s something like Ribena,’ she warns. ‘Colourless medicine would be fine, and would reduce this risk. There is no rationale for using colours or artificial sweeteners.’ A Johnson and Johnson spokesman said: ‘We are committed to patient safety and have numerous safeguards in place to prevent any accidental childhood poisoning. ‘The caps on bottles of Calpol are thoroughly tested to resist a child’s attempts to access the product. ‘The pink colour in Calpol Infant Suspension is long-standing and helps compliance for children by making the medicine they need more acceptable for them. A colour-free variant is also available simply to give parents greater choice, and is not related to any safety concerns.’","Doctors urge Calpol to make change taste and appearance of the medicine .

"A Royal bodyguard is suing Scotland Yard, claiming he is being forced to work too many hours. The officer triggered a probe into the Metropolitan Police by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) after complaining his shifts were longer than EU rules allow. Now he has launched an unprecedented case against the Met about his hours and overtime pay. A Royal bodyguard is suing Scotland Yard, claiming he is being forced to work too many hours . Sources said that the officer, still working for the Met, is likely to win a substantial out-of-court settlement in order to prevent the sensitive work of the Royal protection squad, SO14, being discussed in open court. Last night Britain’s biggest force admitted it had not been good enough at checking officers’ hours. A Met spokesman told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The Metropolitan Police Service acknowledges that the monitoring of officers’ hours was not as robust as it could have been. 'Processes have been improved and the Health and Safety Executive will review our practices in due course.’ The Met’s Protection Command provides security for the Royals, Ministers and visiting dignitaries. SO14 guards the Queen and Royals including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at home and abroad. Because the elite officers guarding them are required to travel so much, they cannot work normal shifts and receive a hefty overtime allowance. In 2010, The Mail on Sunday revealed further perks of working with the Royals, with one male officer accompanying Princes William and Harry (pictured) to the World Cup in South Africa . Official figures show a constable in SO14 earns on average £43,345 a year and £11,202 in overtime allowances. The highest-paid constable guarding Royalty received £82,959 a year. In 2010, The Mail on Sunday revealed further perks of working with the Royals, with one male officer accompanying Princes William and Harry to the World Cup in South Africa claiming £300 for ‘warm-weather clothing’ including three items of women’s clothing. Under the Met’s regulations, officers are meant to work an average of 48 hours a week over six months. But they can opt out of the restriction, and the rules acknowledge that the duties of a Close Protection Officer may exempt them from any time limit. Thousands of British troops and their families are in danger of being attacked in their homes by terrorists following huge cutbacks to the Ministry of Defence Police (MDP), it was claimed last night. The MDP used to keep a watchful eye on 60 married quarters, but after 1,800 posts were axed by the Ministry of Defence in 2012, security patrols ceased at 44 of those. Eamon Keating, chairman of the Defence Police Federation, the staff association for the MDP, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I am incredibly concerned about how easy it would be for someone to attack a soldier’s home. ‘Married quarters have been put last in the list of security priorities, even though personnel and their families are the foundation of our Armed Forces.’ Police documents seen by this newspaper state: ‘On the 8th April 2014 the HSE visited the MPS to investigate a complaint made by an SO14 officer pertaining to an allegation that SO14 had failed to comply with the Working Time Regulation.’ Ken Wharfe, the late Princess Diana’s protection officer, said: ‘This isn’t an eight-hour tour of duty. You cannot compromise security.’ As the case will be settled out of court it will not set a legal precedent, but may open the door for others to launch similar claims.","Probe began after officer said his shifts were longer than EU rules allowed .

"A Canadian father has been left with a heart-wrenching decision as he can only donate part of his liver to one of his sick twin daughters. Michael Wagner from Ontario recently found out he is a match to his adopted three-year-old girls Binh and Phuoc, but was told he can only save one of them after a transplant. He and his wife Johanne took the pair in when they were just 18 months old after seeing they were in poor health at a Vietnamese orphanage. Heart-wrenching choice: Michael Wagner recently found out that his liver is a match to his sick three-year-old twin daughters Binh and Phuoc. However he can only give part to one of them . Both of them suffer from Alagille syndrome - a genetic disorder that affects the liver, heart and other organs. Their liver functions are slowly coming to a halt - meaning a transplant could potentially save their lives. However they will need two donors in order to save them both - so have begun a frantic search for another match. They have started a Facebook page in a bid to find a candidate and ask for donations. While the hunt continues, a team of doctors at Toronto General Hospital will now decide which of the girls will receive the transplant. Mrs Wagner told The Canadian Press: 'We told them we didn't want to be burdened with the decision making. Taken in: Mr Wagner and his wife Johanne adopted when they were 18 months old after seeing they were in poor health at a Vietnamese orphanage . She added doctors are expected to perform the surgery in around two weeks, but the family are yet to find a second donor. The Wagners had five of their own children before they decided to take Binh and Phouc in. Mrs Wagner added: 'When we saw them at the orphanage we were shocked, really. 'They were 9 pounds at 18 months. So we left the orphanage that day and went to buy two little containers with dragonflies on them and that's what we were going to lay their ashes in if they didn't make it.' Despite the health problems, Mrs Wagner does not regret her decision. She said: 'We look back and we have no regrets. 'We would travel this path all over again. They have taught us openness, they have taught our children sharing and openness. It's been nothing but a wonderful mess.'

"Trevor Howard, 62, suffered more than 100 bite wounds after he tried to protect his springer spaniel from a pack of dogs . A dog walker   had part of his ear ripped off and flesh torn from his hands and arms after he was set upon by three vicious mastiffs. Trevor Howard, 62, suffered more than 100 bite wounds after he tried to protect his springer spaniel Jess who was killed by the snarling pack. Incredibly, mastiffs owner Yvonne Singh, 46, was allowed to walk free from court this week with a suspended sentence after admitting she was in charge of three dogs that were dangerously out of control. Judge Robin Onions praised the bravery of Mr Howard who used himself as a human shield for dog Jess as he saw the pack approach. 'As soon as he saw them coming he knew what was going to happen,' said Judge Onions. 'With considerable bravery, he lay himself over his own dog as a shield. He was bitten on the arms, hands and body and lost part of his ear. 'Doctors said he had been bitten more than 100 times.' Mr Howard, from Bushbury, Wolverhampton in the West Midlands, told how he and his wife Carol were set upon by the three snarling devil dogs which were in 'attack mode'. 'I don't have to close my eyes,' he said. 'I still see the whole thing. 'We were walking when I heard a sound like the baying of hounds and they came round the corner. The Bull Mastiff was in attack mode. 'I picked Jess up and leaned forward, pressing her between my stomach and thighs, but her rump and head were sticking out. The more I bent over her, the more they ripped at me to get to her. 'I didn't feel the pain. I was just sickened to see the terror in the face of our dog. 'My wife was bitten a couple of times. Then a passer-by said he would try to find the owner. Three young lads in hoodies came along and pulled the dogs off us. His beloved springer spaniel Jess, pictured, had to be put down after the attack in which she suffered terrible injuries . Mr Howard was bitten repeatedly (pictured) after he bravely used himself as a human shield for his dog Jess as he saw the pack approach . The 62-year-old, who said he will never have another dog, was rescued by three boys in hoodies who helped pull off the vicious mastiffs . 'I was very lucky but we will never have another dog.' Despite his brave actions, Jess suffered appalling injuries and had to be put to sleep six days after the attack on April 10 last year. Singh, of Fordhouses, Wolverhampton, had been looking after the dogs when she let them out the house without checking the garden gate was secure, the court heard. The jobless mum-of-three was was handed a four-month prison sentence, suspended for two years at Wolverhampton Crown Court and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. She was also banned from keeping dogs for seven years and told to pay Mr Howard £500 compensation. The three dogs, a Bull Mastiff and two French Mastiffs, were ordered to be destroyed. Oliver Woodhouse, defending, said: 'The dogs are powerful but not prohibited animals. 'Her error of judgement in omitting to check the security of the gate had consequences which she deeply regrets.'

"Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras  (pictured) has rejected suggestions that Athens is under pressure to come to terms with its creditors by the end of next month . The euro stands on the brink of its biggest ever crisis today as Greeks vote in their general election – with the anti-austerity party Syriza maintaining a four-point lead in the polls. With the euro at its lowest value against sterling in seven years, a Syriza victory could trigger panic in the EU and the eurozone – risking bankruptcy for Greece and its exit from the euro. With the fate of Greece’s €240 billion bailout from the European Union and IMF unclear, Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras has rejected any suggestion that Athens is under pressure to come to terms with its creditors by the end of next month. All polls show Left-wing Syriza in the lead and inching towards the numbers needed for outright victory as its message of cancelling austerity and securing a debt write-off attracts Greeks hit by four years of wage and pension cuts. ‘Light has won over darkness. Victory and a majority are within our grasp,’ Tsipras told supporters at his final campaign rally in Crete on Friday. Greece has gone through a deep recession and a quarter of its workforce are still unemployed. Yesterday it emerged that some Greeks have stopped paying their tax bills in recent weeks, hoping a Syriza government would not pursue the debt. The reluctance of so many Greeks to pay taxes was cited as a fundamental cause of the country’s economic woes in the first place. Supporters wave a Greek national flag as opposition leader and head of radical leftist Syriza party, Alexis Tsipras delivers a speech during a campaign in central Athens on January 22 this year . Meanwhile, Greek PM Antonis Samaras warned Syriza posed a grave threat to Greece’s economy and national security. ‘We will not allow them to take us back to the past,’ Samaras told supporters of his New Democracy party, in a last-ditch attempt to bolster support. ‘Syriza isn’t going to change Europe, instead it will turn it against Greece,’ he said.","Euro on brink of its biggest ever crisis as Greeks vote in general election .

"A Japanese hostage held by Islamic State revealed that his fellow captive has been beheaded in a gruesome video released by the terror group on Saturday. In the film, Kenji Goto Jogo was shown holding a picture of Haruna Yukawa’s decapitated body. Mr Goto, 47, a freelance journalist, then delivered a message in English in which he blames Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, for Mr Yukawa’s death and pleads to his wife, Rinko: ‘Don’t let Abe do the same for my case.’ This still image apparently showing Japanese prisoner Kenji Goto holding a picture of fellow captive Haruna Yukawa's body appeared alongside the recording, but some have said it looks photoshopped . The video emerged a day after a deadline passed for Japan’s government to buy the two hostages’ release. On Tuesday, Islamic State (IS) posted a video in which the masked British executioner known as Jihadi John demanded £134 million within 72 hours to free the two men. In the video, the group said it no longer wanted the ransom, but demanded the release of an Al Qaeda prisoner Sajida Al-Rishawi, on Death Row in the Jordanian capital, Amman. Al-Rishawi, 44, took part in co-ordinated suicide attacks on three hotels in Amman in 2005 which killed 60. Her suicide vest failed to detonate and she was later found guilty of terrorism and sentenced to death. Mr Goto said in the video the new demand was easier to meet as the Japanese delegation sent to Amman to secure his release could put pressure the Jordanian government to release Al-Rishawi. Mr Goto (left) appeared in recent footage  alongside Mr Yukawa (right) and ISIS murderer Jihadi John. However experts also believe this footage was doctored, possibly stitched together from several recordings . In his emotional message, Mr Goto said: ‘Rinko, my beloved wife, I love you, and I miss my two daughters. Please don’t let Abe do the same for my case. Don’t give up. You, along with our family, friends and my colleagues in the independent press must continue to pressure our government.’ In a section almost certainly scripted by IS, he added: ‘Abe, you killed Haruna, you did not take the threat of my captors seriously and you did not act within 72 hours.’ Mr Goto finished his message by saying: ‘Rinko, these could be my last hours in this world and I may be a dead man speaking, don’t let these be my last words you ever hear. Don’t let Abe also kill me.’ The video has still to be verified but Shiraz Maher, terrorism expert at London’s International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation, said: ‘It probably is genuine.’ Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said: ‘If confirmed, the brutal murder of Haruna Yukawa is a barbaric and despicable act.’","Kenji Goto Jogo shown with image of Haruna Yukawa’s decapitated body .

"It is one of the most recognisable and popular of all instruments, and yet its design has remained almost unchanged for 100 years. But now Hungarian musician Gergely Boganyi claims to have reinvented the grand piano after spending 8,000 hours and almost £1million building his own in a workshop in Budapest. With its edgy design, finished entirely in glossy black paint, music fans have dubbed the creation the Batpiano - for its resemblance to the Batmobile. Scroll down for video . Gergely Boganyi, 41, has spent ten years, 8,000 hours and almost £1million redesigning the grand piano in a workshop above a disused communist-era factory in Hungary . Bogyani has replaced most of the traditional wood with carbon fibre, designed two legs which act as sound deflectors to project music, and redesigned the key mechanism . Viewers of the new creation at a premiere event in Budapest earlier this month described the instrument as a Batpiano - because its angular body and black pain resemble the Batmobile . It is certainly futuristic, doing away with most of the wood traditionally used in grand pianos such as the Steinway, and replacing it with cutting-edge carbon fibre. Almost every single one of the instrument's 18,000 components has been redesigned. Rather than the traditional three legs, the Boganyi has only two, and both of them have been carefully shaped to help project the sound into the auditorium. He had also reinvented the key mechanism, meaning it applies only the slightest pressure to the soundboard - the anchor of the piano to which everything else is fixed. The board itself, instead of being made from the traditional wood, is made from more than 20 carbon composite layers woven one on top of the other. Boganyi, 41, a feted concert pianist who has spent more than a decade building the instrument in a workshop above a disused communist-era factory, is optimistic about the results. He said: 'What we created will enrich piano history. It is said that old pianos sound friendly, velvety, while new ones are stronger and more powerful. I was hoping for both.' The piano traces its history back to the dulcimer, an instrument made of strings stretched across a board played with hand-held hammers, which was invented in Iran shortly after the birth of Christ. However, the first modern piano was created by Bartolomeo di Francesco Cristofori in Florence, Italy, in 1709 and was called gravicembalo col piano e forte - which roughly translates as 'harpsichord with soft and loud'. Boganyi won his first music prize at the age of six, and has gone on to play as a soloist in some of the most critically acclaimed orchestras in the world, including the London Philharmonic in 2004 . Boganyi says that, unlike other modern redesigns such as though sponsored by Peugeot and Audi, his was focused entirely on the sound, rather than the appearance . Following a premiere concert in Budapest on Wednesday this week, the piano will go on sale later this year. Boganyi does not know how much it will cost yet, but says 'it will be expensive' It was designed to improve upon the harpsichord, the favoured instrument of Bach and Handel, which produced notes by plucking at strings, rather than striking them. The plucking action meant that the harpsichord was only capable of producing one flat tone, while the piano's hammer action meant the tone varied depending on how hard the key was struck. During the late 18th century, around the time Beethoven was playing, craftsmen added more keys to the instrument, as well as the first pedals to dampen or sustain notes. The suit the new styles of playing, the hammers were made heavier, and the strings stronger, producing a powerful new sound. Makers also experimented with upright versions, with the strings stretched vertically in front of the player, and square grand pianos. The last great period of invention came in the mid to late 1800s, when Steinway & Sons developed their grand piano, and added a third pedal underneath. But now Boganyi, who won his first music prize aged six and performs as a soloist in acclaimed orchestras such as the London Philharmonic, is hoping to add to that history with his latest version. He says the new instrument is based on innovations dreamed up, but not widely used, by 19th-century Hungarian piano makers. The instrument's soundboard, the central fitting to which all other parts are fixed, has been refashioned out of 20 layers of carbon composite woven together giving the piano a lighter, airier sound . Jazz pianist Gerald Clayton described playing the new piano as like being 'in a spaceship, like you are hovering above gravity (pictured, Boganyi plays the piano in his workshop) Boganyi and his design team are pictured with the new piano in their workshop in Szigethalom . And it seems that it could have been worth the wait as expert piano players agreed that the sound it produces is entirely new. Karoly Reisinger, CEO of New York piano repair shop Klavierhaus, was 'mesmerized at the sound he said brought lyrical qualities back to the piano after a century of power-focused development. He said: 'In this design you will be able to hear the 1850-1860 era qualities, lyrical, bell-like, precise – and also the modern instrument that our time is used to, which is clarity.' Four-time Grammy-nominated jazz pianist Gerald Clayton said he felt he had played a slick new type of instrument. He added: 'The sound almost feels as if you're in a bubble, it's so clear. It feels like you are in a spaceship, like you are hovering above gravity. 'When you play a lot of notes, or you play a chord, the sensation is different. It's super-clear.' Following a premiere in the Grand Concert Hall in Budapest earlier this month, the piano will go on sale later this year. Boganyi does not know how much each one will cost yet, but he says 'with these materials it will not be cheap.'","Feted classical musician Gergely Boganyi, 41, build his own grand piano .

"The RSPCA is to close the animal hospital made famous in the BBC TV show of the same name presented by disgraced broadcaster Rolf Harris. The closure of Putney Animal Hospital and three other London clinics comes as it struggles with dwindling donations and a negative profile. But critics accused the RSPCA of deserting its role of treating sick animals in favour of ‘politicised’ prosecutions. Scroll down for video . Rolf Harris with co-stars Edwina Silver and Rhodri Williams outside Putney Animal Hospital which is set to close following dwindling donations . Tim Bonner of the Countryside Alliance said: ‘This is in an inevitable consequence of pursuing a politicised agenda that has alienated so many of its supporters. 'It has a choice where to cut. Closures suggest it is again prioritising politics and prosecution over caring for animals on the front line.’ In 2012, the charity was criticised by a judge for its £326,000 prosecution against the Heythrop Hunt, based in David Cameron’s constituency. Figures published last May show the RSPCA’s voluntary income in 2013 dropped from £112.4 million to £105.4 million. The Putney closure is a ‘huge blow’ according to staff. Its clients are pensioners and those on low incomes who cannot afford private pet care. Last night a spokesman said: ‘The RSPCA has to target those animals most in need of our help and streamline our frontline services.’ In 2012 the charity spent £326,000 on prosecution against the Heythrop Hunt (staff pictured above)","Putney Animal Hospital and three other London clinics are set to close .

"Normally when I'm enjoying honey it's spread on a piece of toast or spooned into a cup of tea – not slathered all over my back. But the skyline honey treatment at Jumeirah Frankfurt’s Talise Spa is no ordinary massage. Using a gritty paste containing granulated fruit and honey produced from beehives atop the luxury hotel’s roof, it feels like the massage therapist is giving my back and shoulders the once-over with sandpaper. It may sound uncomfortable, but the spa’s signature treatment is so relaxing that I almost dozed off a few times. Couples who are looking for a romantic getaway can book a double treatment room at the Talise Spa at Jumeirah Frankfurt . Located within the hotel, Talise Spa offers guests the perfect way to unwind with two saunas, relaxation areas and seven treatment rooms . The skyline honey treatment is Talise Spa's signature treatment, using honey from rooftop hives occupied by an estimated 40,000 bees . Guests can enjoy a relaxing drink in a quiet sauna room (there is one for men and one for women) before or after their treatments . From the moment the therapist told me to take a deep breath to the moment I climbed off the table, the exfoliating massage soothed the aches and pains I developed from sitting at a computer for more than 40 hours a week. Capped with a relaxing head massage, I emerged with my skin feeling smoother than ever before. From there I retreated to the sauna – there’s one for men and one for women – before returning to my deluxe studio room inside the 24-storey hotel, located in the heart of Frankfurt. Relaxing at the warm, comfortable Talise Spa proved to be the perfect way to unwind after spending a few hours in the cold. Jumeirah Frankfurt's studio and deluxe studio rooms are designed to provide 'an enriched metropolitan living experience' Each deluxe studio boasts a comfortable king-size bed and the centrepiece of the room - a standalone bathtub that provides a relaxing soak . The deluxe studio bathroom is an open space with a separate walk-in shower and a television embedded in the steam-proof mirror . Each studio and deluxe studio room boasts a spacious living are with a 42in flat-screen TV that swivels to face the couches or bed . Just a few hours before I settled in for the treatment I was downing gluwhein and stuffing my face with bratwurst and gingerbread (and maybe a chocolate-dipped pretzel) at Frankfurter Weihnachtsmarkt (Frankfurt Christmas Market). At every turn along the one-kilometre market visitors encounter tiny log cabins selling mulled wine, sausage on a bun, reibekuchen (potato pancakes), heart-shaped gingerbread or, for those who have had their fill, hand-crafted ornaments and souvenirs. With its central location Jumeirah is just steps from the sprawling and wildly-popular festive market and the Zeil shopping street, and within walking distance to many other attractions that are open year-round. For those who are attending events in central Frankfurt or just doing some shopping on a weekend break, Jumeirah Frankfurt’s location provides the perfect base. Jumeirah Frankfurt's beekeeper visits the property on average once a week in spring and summer to collect honey from the beehives . Jumeirah Frankfurt’s roof terrace on the 28th floor is home to more than 40,000 bees which produce honey used in its breakfast buffet . Guests can sit down fora formal meal or relax on sofas and armchairs in the lounge at Max on One, the hotel's signature restaurant . While the luxurious hotel is largely designed for business travellers, everyone is pampered during their stay at the Dubai-owned chain's lone location in Germany. Friendly employees go out of their way to make guests feel important – from the moment they’re greeted with a complimentary drink upon arrival to the moment they check out. With sweeping views of Frankfurt, my deluxe studio was incredibly sleek and stylish with ultimate comfort. It had warm colours with dark wood finishes that matched the colour of the floor. Each deluxe studio boasts a spacious living room, 42in flat-screen TV that swivels to face the couches or bed, and touch pads that control the curtains, lighting and temperature. Skyline deluxe rooms offer incredible views of Frankfurt's towering skyscrapers, including the 56-storey Commerzbank Tower . Jumeirah Frankfurt’s room tempering system uses body heat and motion sensors to regulate in-room energy consumption . The hotel is located in central Frankfurt and within walking distance to popular shopping areas and a number of museums . But the centrepiece of the room is a large standalone tub that straddles the bathroom and bedroom, and provides a relaxing soak while sipping your beverage of choice (in my case, it was a German wheat beer). The bathroom is an open space with a separate walk-in shower and a television embedded in the steam-proof mirror. The bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept on, although my sleep was disrupted by the sound of people in the room above me stomping around the floor. One of the hotel's most impressive bits of state-of-the-art technology is its innovative room tempering system. Instead of conventional air conditioning it features a hybrid room tempering system using body heat detectors and motion sensors that, according to the hotel, regulate all in-room energy consumption efficiently and sustainably. Still, the room temperature can be controlled with the push of a button. With fresh ingredients and seasonal fare, the food at Max on One is inventive with great attention to detail, and the service is outstanding . Max on One, located on the hotel's first floor, offers a relaxed and warm atmosphere not usually found at high-end restaurants . With access to the hotel and MyZeil shopping centre the El Rayyan restaurant offers an authentic selection of Lebanese cuisine . For dining or drinks, Jumeirah Frankfurt offers three options – Max on One for finer cuisine, El Rayyan for authentic Lebanese dishes, and Ember Bar and Lounge for cocktails. With fresh ingredients and seasonal fare, the food at Max on One is inventive with great attention to detail, and the service is outstanding. The meal I had was absolutely delicious – chestnut soup as a starter, perfectly prepared goose and potatoes as the main, and a specially-prepared spekulatius cake for dessert. For those who want to hit the gym or go for a dip to burn off calories during their stay, all Jumeirah Frankfurt guests have complimentary access to the Fitness First Platinum Swim Club in the neighbouring MyZeil shopping centre.

"The white supremacist attempting to turn a small North Dakotan town into a ‘white enclave’ has undergone a DNA test which proves he is of Sub-Saharan African heritage, MailOnline can reveal. Craig Cobb, 62, submitted to the test as part of The Trisha Show’s ongoing Race in America series and was given the results of the DNA Diagnostics test by the host, Trisha Goddard, to the whoops of her studio audience. On hearing the results Cobb, who insists he is not a white supremacist but a Creator, a religion which favours ‘racial awareness’, immediately dismissed the news that genetically he is 14 per cent Sub Saharan African, 86 per cent European, as ‘statistical noise.’ Scroll down for video . White supremacist Craig Cobb tries to tune out the 'statistical noise' that reveals his genetic makeup is 86 per cent European and 14 per cent Sub-Saharan African . Enemy within: Cobbs recoils from TV talk show host Trisha Goddard's attempted 'fist bump' on learning that he has Sub-Saharan African DNA . 'You've got a little black in you bro': Trisha moves in for a fist bump undeterred by her guest's evident reluctant to meet her hand or eye . If at first you don't succeed....Cobb will make sure you never do. Trisha is left hanging by her guest's refusal to make contact . He said: ‘I tell you. Oil and water don’t mix.’ With a fixed grin Cobb, a man who relies on a dizzying array of statistics to underpin his own agenda of racial discrimination and sexual intolerance, shook his head and tried to wave these ones away. As the studio audience jeered and crowed in delight, Goddard insisted: ‘You have a little black in you.’ When the 55-year-old British host tried to fist bump her guest, with the words, ‘So there you go bro,’ Cobb visibly recoiled and twice refused to meet her touch. Speaking to MailOnline Cobb said: 'I agreed to the test because I assumed it was science.' Instead, he said, it was a scientifically bankrupt procedure, the product of 'craven and debased executives,' whose 'goal is to shock.' He said: 'When I told Jeff Schoep [leader of the National Socialism Movement] he just laughed.' He described it as 'short science' used by a sensationalist television show to 'promote multiculturalism.' When pressed over how he would feel if a test he respected were to show the presence of such DNA he said: 'Well if I did have any n**** we don't want anymore of it.' He would, he said, consider himself a 'border guard for the pure breds.' He explained: 'Keeping the peace if possible but if we have to fight, keeping the frontline in the war.' Condemned: A sign raised by Craig Cobb in the trees above his land in Leith, North Dakota. The words Credo 64 refer to the 'White Man's Bible,' the so-called holy book for Creators - of which he is one . Followers of Cobb: Badge wearing member of the National Socialist Movement, Kynan Dutton, wife Deborah Dutton and their five children are the first family to move to Leith, N.D in an attempt to establish a white enclave . A look down Main Street in Leith, N.D. Many of its 16 residents had never even heard of white supremacy until its proponents tried to take over their town . War, or the threat of it, is what the residents of Leith fear, Cobb has brought to their doors. His plans for the tiny North Dakotan . town of Leith came to light earlier this summer. Then, amid a fury of . local and national reaction, it emerged that the wild-haired eccentric . who had been living in the town for more than a year, was a hate crimes . fugitive who had quietly bought up lots of land with the intention of . turning the community into a haven for white supremacists. But now, after an immediate flurry of rallies and town meetings, residents fear they are powerless to halt the man whose plans they regard as ‘pure evil,' and who has put up a sign condemning their town as  'The Village of the Damned.' Since his plans were exposed, they say, he has goaded and harassed them in an attempt to provoke them into violence and open the way for him to bring charges or a civil suit. Leith's only black resident, Bobby Harper, is a member of the current town council. He says he is 'better' than Cobb but believes the situation can only get worse . Pushed to breaking point: Cobb has publicly blamed councilman Lee Cook, 49, for the murder of his own daughter - killed in 2000 by the then boyfriend of his ex-wife . Mayor Ryan Schock, mayor and lifelong resident of Leith, N.D., is frustrated with the actions of white nationalist Craig Cobb who moved to town with the plan to establish a white enclave and admits they may be out of options . The town’s only bi-racial couple Sherrill and Bobby Harper have come under particular pressure. Bobby is the only black man in town. A note pinned to the couple’s door recently read: ‘What are you doing “married” to a Negro?’ and demanded Sherill leave her husband and ‘join Mr Cobb’s movement.’ Two weeks ago Mr Cobb confronted the Harpers on The Trisha Show, demeaning their relationship with the words: ‘She has her pet you see.’ Speaking to MailOnline Mr Harper was philosophical and dignified. He said he was 'better' than Cobb but expressed his belief that the situation was 'going to get worse.' In an interview with MailOnline Mr Cobb referred to African Americans as ‘jungle bunnies’ and ‘Orks’ and said that black people were: ‘Strolling biological early warning devices. They look bad, they sound bad and often times they smell bad.’ Sherill and Bobby Harper speaking from their home in Leith as the full extent of Cobb's plans became apparent. Their lives have been disrupted but they are determined to stand their ground . A grinning Craig Cobb walks near his home in Leith, ND, with a supporter and the flags that fly almost daily in the background. He wasn't smiling when he was told he was part Sub-Saharan African . In what he referred to as a ‘better world where we are in charge,’ he said that all black immigrants to America would be instructed on arrival: ‘If you try to have sex with our white handmaidens we will hang you.’ He used profoundly offensive racist and mysogynistic language saying he was 'very proud' to do so as he regarded the terms as 'holy words' enshrined in the 'White Man's Bible,' in which, as a Creator, he believes. In a recent town meeting Cobb singled out Leith town councilman Lee Cook, 49, the founder of the town’s Legal Defense Fund established to pay for their fight against Cobb. Leith, N.D. Sheriff Steve Bay, left, and deputy Darwin Roth talk near the entrance of the Leith townhall at a meeting last Sunday. But the town may have run out of legal options to stop Cobb's march. One man's dream...a small town's nightmare: Flags of various organizations, some representing the National Socialist Movement, fly in front of the home of white nationalist Craig Cobb in Leith, N.D. Thirteen years ago Mr Cook’s 17 year old daughter, Crystal was murdered by the then boyfriend of his ex-wife. Now remarried and with three children by second wife Heather, his move to Leith was, in part, a bid to escape the painful associations of the Washington town in which the murder took place. Cobb suggested that Mr Cook was in some way responsible for his daughter’s death. According to Mr Cook: ‘He hoped to get me to beat him up so that he could sue me. He wants to look like the victim but this is all his doing. ‘It was an evil attempt by a demented individual to aggravate me.’ Today Mr Cook sleeps with a loaded by his side and has bought his wife a firearm. In a desperate bit to prevent Cobb from fulfilling his dream in Leith, the town council have voted through a string or ordinances putting a moratorium on building, instituting standards of potable water and sewerage and prohibiting anyone living in a trailer on Leith land for more than 10 days straight. But ultimately, Mayor Ryan Schock, 38, admitted: ‘We don’t know what comes next.’ One family of White supremacists have already responded to Cobb’s call for followers and have moved into his ramshackle home on what passes for the town’s main street. Kynan and Deborah Dutton, both 28, moved to Leith from Oregon on 23 September. Their five children aged between 11 and four are home-schooled by former teacher, Deborah. Dutton, a Marine Corps veteran who served in the Iraq war in 2004 and 2005 is proud to call himself Cobb’s Sergeant in Arms. He puts flags, including that of the Third Reich, The National Socialist Movement, and one symbolising the right to bear arms, in front of Cobb’s home each day. He takes them in at night because, he said: ‘The native Americans are notorious for coming and stealing them.’ With just 16 residents in the town Cobb is confident that his bid to outnumber the locals with his followers and take over the council will succeed. He claims another family is on their way and has threatened to bring member of the ‘hard core Aryan Nations’ group to the town and ex-convicts who have ‘been in Federal prison for 20 years.’ He said: ‘We will become the majority there is no doubt. Do not ask for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for Leith.’ This episode of The Trisha Show, by NBCUniversal, airs on Monday 18 November .","Hate crimes fugitive Craig Cobb confronted with result of genetic heritage test on The Trisha Show .

"Size 22 Mississippi mother Tess Holliday has proven her critics wrong and, after years of trying, been signed by a modelling agency who is hailing her as the largest professional plus-size model in the business. 'I feel like it's breaking ground,' the 29-year-old told The New York Daily News. 'This is a milestone. I never could have imagined that I could be here.' Holliday endured years of bulling during her small town upbringing in Laurel, and the abuse she suffered would continue through to her adult life and career. Scroll down for video . Pushing the envelope: Size 22 mom Tess Holliday has been signed by MiLK Model Management, who are hailing her the largest professional plus-size model in the business . Success: Tess Holliday's modeling career is on the up. She is seen here with her husband, Nick Holliday . Provocative: Holliday has built her name on social media over the years, and now has an agency . 'It took a really long time to get over things that had happened to me during the vital years of my life,' she said. As a teenager, Holliday traveled to Atlanta for a model casting, but, at 5 feet 5, was told she was too short and too big. 'My mom always encouraged me,' she said. 'But the rest of my friends and family thought I was nuts.' Holliday puts her determination down to her activeness. Lazy she is not. Holliday has a nine-year-old son, a husband, she works out with a trainer, and is now getting a steady stream of work. 'I never sit down. If I'm not shooting twelve hours a day, I'm out doing errands and going to meetings,' Holliday told The Daily News. Sexy: The 29-year-old is being hailed as the largest plus-sized model in the business . Unabashed: Holliday's career has proven wrong the bullies that have followed her through life . Her big break came in 2011, when A&E chose her to be the face of their documentary series, Heavy, after discovering her online. Since then she has modeled for Domino Dollhouse, SWAK, Jessica Louise Clothing, Evil Pawn Jewelry, Black Cat Bikinis, and more. In 2013, Holliday started a social media movement she called #effyourbeautystandards, a salute to pushing positive body image. That same year was named by Vogue Italia as one of the top six plus-size models in the world. Last year she became engaged for Australian businessman Nick Holliday, whose surname she has now adopted. Happy: Holliday is a mother and a wife and says she works out each week with a trainer . Love: The model became engaged to Australian businessman, Nick Holliday, last year. They live in LA . But her biggest break yet came on Thursday, when MiLK Model Management announced they had signed Holliday to their plus-size arm, Curves. It was a strange move, given Holliday - at 260 pounds - is the shortest and largest model in their portfolio. Plus-size models are typically size 8 to 16 and at least 5 feet 8 inches. The agency said they cottoned on to Holliday because of her vast social media influence, especially on Instagram. The decision to sign her has been lauded. 'It's radical to have an agency willing to stand behind someone and push the envelope about what way models have to look,' QueerFatFemme blogger Begin Branlandingham told The Daily News. 'Bodies come in all shapes and sizes. 'A good model has more to do with how she works in front of a camera then what her height and weight proportions are.' Peace: Tess Holiday has 308,000 followers on the social media site Instagram. Holliday's trajectory is a triumph over her critics and her bullies. Perhaps in a 'that-will-show-them' move, she has a tattoo of Miss Piggy on her right arm. But success does not nastiness, and Holliday still receives plenty of negativity. 'I'm always still that 13-year-old girl in Mississippi who people told I wasn't good enough,' she said. 'I never could have imagined that I could be here.'","Tess Holliday, 29, was signed by MiLK Model Management on Thursday .

"Serial reality TV star Jamie Otis married a complete stranger on television just moments after branding the wedding 'the worst decision of my entire life' as she didn't find her new husband in anyway attractive. The 27-year-old agreed to  marry software salesman Doug Hehner, 31, on the first episode of FYI's new extreme reality show Married at First Sight.

'I couldn't help but look at his family, because they were like, beaming, huge smiles, looking at me, and I just happen not to be attracted to the guy.'

I'm thinking I just made the worst decision of my life. I am so scared.' Otis had previously appeared on The Bachelor and spin-off series The Bachelor Pad.

Otis told the New York Post: 'In New York City, I feel like the guys are primarily just players until they’re hitting their late 30s. It’s tough to find guys who are serious.' The show is based on a format first used in Denmark. In an interview with The Knot, Otis revealed: 'The truth is, I never envisioned a traditional wedding for myself. 'Nothing about my life is traditional, so why worry about having a traditional wedding? 'It was a genuinely intimate, personal, and real experience.

"A Texas teacher who resigned after being accused of having an inappropriate relationship with one of her students was allegedly caught by an officer straddling the same 15-year-old in her car. Maris Gonzalez, 23, of San Antonio, Texas, was taken to Bexar County Jail on January 20 after an officer reporting to a burglar alarm noticed a car nearby with fogged up, windows and, upon approaching, 'found Gonzalez in the car partially clothed, with the young boy.' The boy originally told the officer he was 18, but later revealed he was 15, at which point Gonzalez admitted as to why she recently resigned from her job. Maris Gonzalez (above) was caught straddling a 15-year-old boy in her car, and later admitted to having sex with him to an officer . Gonzalez was formerly the boy's teacher at Madison High School (above) but resigned after inappropriate texts between the two were discovered . North East Independent School District Aubrey Chancellor told KENS that Gonzalez was a French teacher at Madison High School and that 'allegations were brought forth after inappropriate messages were found on the teen's phone.' Gonzalez denied these allegations and said she and the teenager only texted one another. After her arrest, the officer said she admitted that she had been having sex with the boy for weeks, but not before she had left her job. She was placed on leave on December 9 of last year. 'A teacher knows there are lines that are not supposed to be crossed, and from looking at the phone records in this particular case, those lines were certainly crossed in a way of lengthy phone conversations in the middle of the night, and text messages, text messages that were not appropriate,' said Chancellor. She has now been charged with a felony.","Maris Gonzalez of San Antonio, Texas resigned from Madison High School following inappropriate texts between her and a 15-year-old student .

"A seven-year-old boy has been mauled to death by his family's two dogs. Malaki Mildward died after two six-month-old canines attacked him on Thursday afternoon in College Springs, Iowa. He was pronounced dead 50 minutes later. Killed: Malaki Mildward, seven, was mauled to death by the family's two six-month-old dogs (it is unclear if was the dogs in this photo) Tragic: The little boy was unconscious by the time the incident was spotted by a relative. His father Xavier Mildward shared a picture on Facebook of Malaki, with the words: 'I love you so much my baby boy' Police were notified shortly before 5pm. By the time they arrived within minutes, Malaki was not breathing, a report said. Emergency paramedics were also called to the scene to perform CPR. It was reported both of the dogs stood by calmly as paramedics tried to save the child. Unable to revive him, first responders transported the child to Clarinda Regional Medical Center, where he was declared dead.

Malaki lived with his older sister, his mother, Amber Braymen, Jeremiah Hicks and Hicks’ son. Page County Sheriff Lyle Palmer told Omaha.com that the dogs were mixed-breeds with some bulldog heritage, but neither would be considered a pit bull. He said he saw the dogs in the pound Friday morning before they were euthanized and showed 'no aggressiveness.' Malaki's family also had another dog, a bulldog type that was not involved in the attack - it was also put down on Friday morning. Palmer said Malaki often played outside with the dogs and there had no been any problems.

Cardosa abused one former student, who is now 29, from 1997 to 2001, starting when the child was 12 and attending Chemawa Middle School in Riverside, prosecutors said. In a video posted online on January 17, 2013, the former student telephones Alhambra High School, where Cardosa was working, and receptionists connect her to a woman who identifies herself as Cardosa. The now 29-year-old mother Jamie Carrillo said that she made the video post as the statute of limitations has run out for her to be able to prosecute and that she didn't want Cardosa around other children. In the call, she tells the woman, who identifies herself as Ms Cardosa, that she did something terribly wrong at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside 15 years ago. Cardosa replies: 'Yes, and I regret it.' Ms Carrillo then asks what the woman would do if a student told her that she was having a sexual relationship with a teacher to which she replies that she would involve law enforcement. Confession: The then  28-year-old Jamie Carillo posted a YouTube video where she confronted the woman who allegedly sexually abused her in middle school . She asks: 'So how is that any different from what you did when I was at Chemawa Middle?' To which the alleged molester answers: 'It's not.' Ms Carrillo goes on to tell her alleged attacker that she has children of her own and that her former teacher's actions ruined her life and that she is 'disgusting'. When she hangs up the phone, Ms Carrillo shows that she made the call on the screen and reads out the number. She says: 'And I’m shaking like a leaf... not even an ''I'm sorry.'' Or anything. Just that she regrets it.' Alhambra Unified School District Superintendent Laura Tellez-Gagliano released a statement saying the YouTube link was emailed to the school and they passed it to the Alhambra Police Department. Ms Cardosa, who was named by Ms Carrillo in the, has stepped down from her job. She had worked at the school for four months, according to officials. Ms Carrillo's lawyer questioned whether Chemawa Middle School investigated Ms Cardosa who reportedly met the young girl when she coached her at basketball. Took her on trips: Ms Carrillo said that the teacher (pictured right) took her on out of town trips and made her feel 'special' More than one: After Jamie Carillo (pictured) posted her video on YouTube, a second alleged victim came forward to say that she had also been abused . Ms Carrillo alleges that the coach kissed her in the locker room and put her hand down the then 12-year-old's pants. The former student then claims Ms Cardosa, who is believed to have been in her mid-twenties at the time of the alleged assaults, organized out of town trips so that she could have sex with the underage girl. At a press conference following the video, Ms Carrillo said that she expected others who had allegedly been abused by the teacher to come forward. Horrific abuse: The 29-year-old alleges that her former teacher (left) abused her when she was a student at a California high school . The 29-year-old told KTLA: 'Everything was stolen from me. She just completely manipulated me into thinking that I needed her and I wanted it.' In court papers, prosecutors said Cardosa molested the girl over 100 times, and acts were committed in a locker room and Cardosa's car, and at the home of Cardosa's sister, where the two were almost discovered. Another former student came forward after seeing the video. Brianna, now 18, told detectives that she met Cardosa when she was a student at a middle school in Perris. She said Cardosa drove her to a secluded area in 2010, where she tried to kiss her and inappropriately touched her, court papers state. If convicted of the aggravated sexual assault charges, Cardosa could face a life sentence, prosecutors said. Cardosa was charged with abusing that victim from 2009 to 2010 while she was a student at Tomas Rivera Middle School in Perris. Shortly before she was arrested, Cardosa resigned from her position as an administrator at Alhambra High School.","Andrea Cardosa, a former assistant principal, entered pleas Friday to three counts of lewd acts with a child under 14 .

"Having a car that can drive itself has long been the stuff of science fiction. But scientists have now created a robot car – controlled by an iPad. And the Oxford University team says the technology could be installed in mainstream cars within 15 years. It means futuristic vehicles, like David Hasselhoff’s KITT in the 1980s TV series Knight Rider, could soon be driving us on the commute and school run. Scroll down for video . LOOK NO HANDS . RobotCar, a specially adapted Nissan Leaf electric car, has small cameras and lasers built into its chassis. When the car is driven manually the lasers and cameras act as its ‘eyes’, mapping a 3D model of its surroundings, which is fed into a computer stored in the boot. The car can then ‘remember’ roads and suburbs, allowing it to drive itself along familiar routes. It asks the driver via an iPad on the dashboard whether they want to engage the autopilot and, at a touch of the screen, the car takes over the controls. A laser under the front bumper scans the direction of travel around 13 times per second for obstacles, such as pedestrians, cyclists, or other cars, up to 164ft ahead and in an 85 degree field of view. If the car sees an obstacle, it slows and comes to a controlled stop. The driver can also tap the brake pedal, like in current cruise control systems, to regain control from the computer at any time. Car in control: An Oxford University scientist demonstrates their newly developed navigation system . The . scientists behind the system say it is far superior to conventional . satellite navigation because it is much more precise – reading to within . a fraction of an inch compared with a few yards with sat-nav – and the . car does not need a satellite reference to know where it is. At . £5,000, the prototype is also far cheaper than any other currently in . development – and the aim is to produce one for as little as £100 in the . near future. Project leader . Professor Paul Newman, of Oxford University’s engineering science . department, said that the technology would be especially valuable for . drivers who perform regular routes, such the daily commute or school . run. He added: ‘We are . working on a low-cost auto drive navigation system that doesn’t depend . on GPS, done with discreet sensors that are getting cheaper all the . time. ‘It’s easy to imagine that this kind of technology could be in a car you could buy. Accept? Tapping on the brakes returns control of the vehicle to the driver . ‘Instead . of imagining some cars driving themselves all of the time, we should . imagine a time when all cars can drive themselves some of the time. ‘The sort of low-cost, low-footprint autonomy we are developing is what’s needed for everyday use.’ Last year, Google announced a self-driving car which it said had covered more than 140,000 miles on American roads. The RobotCar has fewer sensors and relies more heavily on an on-board 3D street map. The . basic map could potentially be maintained by local councils or highway . authorities and regularly updated by vehicles. For insurance reasons, . the RobotCar has so far only been allowed to drive on autopilot on the . private roads of Begbroke Science Park, Oxford. But the scientists are in talks with the Department for Transport to see how and when it could be used on public roads. The . next stage of the research will be to make the car recognise and . understand complex traffic flows and make decisions on which routes to . take.

"A former Minister last night took the sensational step of stating that Leon Brittan stood accused of ‘multiple child rape’. Tom Watson, a Defence and Cabinet Office Minister under Labour, said he had spoken to a man who said the former Home Secretary raped him as a child, and a woman who said he raped her in 1967. He added that he knew of two other similar cases. Mr Watson said: ‘Many others knew of these allegations and chose to remain silent. I will not. The police must continue their investigations.’ A former Minister last night took the sensational step of stating that Leon Brittan (pictured) stood accused of ‘multiple child rape’ He said he had not previously spoken out against Brittan, who died of cancer last Wednesday aged 75, because he did not want to prejudice any trial.

Was Brittan protected by a misplaced sense of deference to the powerful?’ Brittan had faced allegations of a ‘lurid sex scandal’ in the 1980s, but at the time the claims were dismissed. Last year he was questioned over the alleged rape of a 19-year-old woman in 1967, although he was not arrested or charged. He was also accused of failing to act on a now-missing dossier on alleged VIP child abusers while at the Home Office. Scotland Yard declined to comment last night, but they have said the 1967 case was under review. Brittan’s supporters have said there is no evidence against him and criticised claims as ‘innuendo’.","Tom Watson claims he spoke to a man who said Leon Brittan had raped him as a child .

"These incredible bouncing bunnies are crushing all preconceived notions about domestic rabbits. The specially-bred, show-jumping bunnies are showing off their hopping skills at a Rabbit Grand National in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. They can leap as high as three feet over hurdles while they navigate a course with their trainers. Professional show-jumping rabbits are showing off their hopping skills at an event in Harrogate . This footage shows the rabbits training for the big event at this weekend’s Burgess Premier Small Animal Show at the Great Yorkshire Showground. It features champion jumpers from Sweden, which have been specifically bred for show-jumping. Matthew Brash, veterinary adviser for Burgess Pet Care, said the jumping event, which first appeared in the UK in 2011, said: ‘We've brought the Swedish rabbit jumping team over. They are really well-trained, they are doing this because they enjoy doing it but it demonstrates just how much rabbits can actually do. The rabbits can leap as high as three feet over hurdles while they navigate a course with their trainers . The rabbits have been specially bred for competition in Sweden, where show-jumping in a pastime . ‘These guys can jump nearly a metre, about 90cm (35.4in) if they're doing a straight jump, and a lot of the time you will see them jumping nearly half a metre, which is just an amazing feat in its own right.’ Tina Larsson, who is appearing at the show with her rabbit Tora, said rabbit jumping is a popular pastime in Sweden, where it began in the 1970s. She said: ‘We breed them for jumping and we have done that for 20 years. It's a known species of rabbit for jumping because we breed them like jumping horses. So they are specially bred for jumping and there are hundreds of jumping rabbits in Sweden. Trainer Tina Larsson said her group has been breeding rabbits 'like jumping horses' for two decades . ‘They have longer legs than other rabbits but mostly it's all about the heads. They have to be smart and intelligent and calm to do jumping. ‘The rabbits who love to jump, they are the best rabbits of course, so we breed the rabbits who love to jump.’ Ms Larsson advised anyone who wanted to train their rabbit to show-jump to begin with low jumps. Trainers say anyone who wants to train their rabbit to leap over hurdles must begin with low jumps . Show-jumping rabbits first appeared at the Burgess Premier Small Animal Show in Harrogate in 2011 . She added: ‘Just love it. If you love it, you will make the rabbit love it. Just decide “I'm going to do this and I'm going to enjoy it”. Don't push the rabbit because you can't push a rabbit, just enjoy it.’ Karin Molin said: ‘My rabbit Micro loves the events and has had several high placements from championships in Sweden and won two gold medals in England this year. ‘His record in high jumping currently stands at 85cm high, we hope to beat it in Harrogate.’","Swedish jumping team appearing at Burgess Premier Small Animal Show .

"A disabled man with the mental age of seven has been barred from his regular visits to Legoland with his carer because of 'child protection' fears. Simon Thomason, 40, who has cerebral palsy, autism and a mental age of seven, has been told his annual pass to the Manchester-based attraction will not be renewed. Legoland Discovery Centre say they have a policy of refusing entry to adults without children and have defended their decision to turn away Mr Thomason, who was accompanied by an adult carer. Scroll down for video . Simon Thomason, 40, who has the mental age of seven, has been barred from Legoland Discovery Centre, Manchester . But families and disability campaigners have slammed the policy as 'discrimination' and say it effectively bans their childless relatives from the attraction. Mr Thomason's sister, Paula, 41, from Irlam, in Greater Manchester, bought the £60 annual pass for her brother  last year after explaining his condition to staff. But after seven months of weekly visits to the attraction in the Trafford Centre Mr Thomason was told he was no longer welcome due to 'child protection'. He was instead offered a pass for alternative venues run by parent group Merlin Attractions elsewhere in the UK. When Miss Thomason argued this was unfair, management said they would honour the last five months on the pass but it would not be renewed. The family also now have to email in advance before he can visit. And in another case, a 20-year-old man with learning disabilities and his carer were also refused entry. The Legoland Discovery Centre, pictured, has a policy of not allowing adults to visit if not accompanied by a child . Elaine Lewis's son Anthony, 20, who has Williams Syndrome and the mental age of six, was also turned away when he tried to visit this week. Mr Lewis's carer was also told adults without children were not allowed entry. The mother, from Gatley, Stockport, said: 'The ridiculous thing is Simon would be allowed in if he went with a child - but neither would be able to look after each other. 'He just wants to go and play with the Lego and look at the models.' Clare Lucas, activism lead at charity Mencap, also slammed the decision. She said: 'It is unfortunate Legoland Discovery's policy has had a negative effect on someone with a learning disability who wanted to go out and access leisure activities many people take for granted. Simon Thomas, pictured with his sister Paula, 41,  had been visiting the attraction on a weekly basis for seven monthswhen he was told he was no longer welcome . The attraction, aimed at three to 10 year olds, features 4D cinema, laser ride, driving school, and offers workshops with master builders. It states on the Discovery Centre website that adults must be accompanied by children to visit. But a spokesman for Legoland Discovery Centre said: 'Our policy not to permit entry to groups of adults, adult couples, or lone adults, regardless of circumstances, who are not accompanied by a child or children under the age of 16 is we believe therefore appropriate and the best way to constantly maintain a welcoming environment for our young visitors. Anthony Lewis, 20, who has Williams Syndrome and the mental age of six, was also refused entry to the attraction . 'We make no apologies for this policy and believe it to be reasonable and appropriate, and one on which we make no exceptions. 'That said, we also very much appreciate the continuing appeal that LEGO has for all ages, and it has never been our intention to deny access to our adult fans, or cause distress to anyone. 'That is why we regularly host evening events specifically for adults in order to showcase specific attractions within the centre and these are very well attended. Anothony's mother Elaine Lewis said her son,  'just wants to go and play with the Lego and look at the models' 'We hope very much that all adult guests will join us at one of these sessions and we are sure that he would very much enjoy it. 'However if an evening event is difficult for him to attend then if his family make contact we would be happy to agree a time when one of our managers is available to show him around.'","Disabled Simon Thomason barred from regular visits to Legoland .

"A 13-year-old boy was arrested on Saturday for allegedly fatally stabbing a 14-year-old boy with scissors outside of a Los Angeles middle school on Friday. Steven Cruz, a student at James A. Garfield Senior High School, was stabbed at a neighboring school in what officials and witnesses say may have been a gang related incident. The youngster was standing by the school's fence as classes were let out at the end of the day when the suspect allegedly approached him, asked him where he was from and stabbed him in the torso. The boy accused of killing him was picked up by police from his Los Anegles home at 1:30am and then transported to an East L.A. sheriff’s station where he was booked for murder. Scroll down for video . Dead: Steven Cruz, 14, was fatally stabbed outside of David Wark Griffith Junior High School in Los Angeles in what police and witnesses are saying may have been a gang-related attack . Tribute: Flowers surrounded a picture of the schoolboy as residents mourned his death on Saturday. A 13-year-old bpy was arrested and charged with murder at his Los Angeles home . Cruz was at the neighboring middle school David Wark Griffith Junior High School for unknown reasons. 'Somebody's been stabbed,' yelled a frantic witness at around 3 p.m. on Friday. The LA Times reports that the witness saw the 'severely injured' Cruz trying to climb the stairs calling for help. KTLA reports that when the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department arrived at the middle school they found Cruz with a stab wound to his torso. 'While the victim was on campus, the suspect approached the victim, stabbed him in the chest, and fled the scene south on Fetterly Avenue,' said a statement from the LASD. He was transported to a local hospital where he died of his injuries. According to news release by the LASD the suspect was seen on foot running down a nearby avenue. The scene: Over a dozen cop cars congregate outside of David Wark Griffith Junior High School where the victim was brutally stabbed . Investigation: An investigation is underway after a 14-year-old student was stabbed to death with a sharp object outside Griffith School . Lt. Holly Francisco of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said that there appeared to be no quarrel before the stabbing. 'The investigators are just doing interviews now, but we don’t have any indication that there was a fight prior to the stabbing,' Francisco said. 'It appears to be an isolated incident.' Some witnesses question whether or not the incident was gang related based on where either victim was from. The stabbing occurred as students were being let out but around 100 students who remained on the campus for after-school programs were on lock-down for hours as officers searched for the suspect. Concerned parents and students gathered outside the school to pick up their children. The LA Times spoke with troubled mother Edith Torres who waited outside the school for hours so she could take her young daughter home. 'You never know, you’re thinking that your kids are safe and the last thing that you expect is for this to happen,' Torres said.

"Leah Gilbert exercises for up to one hour twice a day, six days a week when she is training for sprint triathlons or half marathons. But you would be surprised to learn the fitness instructor, from Newcastle - 160 kilometres north of Sydney - in New South Wales, weighs 90 kilograms. This is the issue Ms Gilbert has addressed in a post she did for fitness blog Sportette, saying she wanted people to change their perception of trimness equalling fitness. Ms Gilbert said people with curvier bodies like hers should be considered as athletes because they trained like athletes and nurtured their bodies like athletes. Leah Gilbert, from Newcastle, has penned a blog post about being a plus size endurance athlete . 'The only difference is, we're larger than most people's perception of an ""athlete"" so you probably think we're out there just trying to lose weight. And that's OK - some of us may well be training down to a race weight - just like other athletes do,' she wrote in a post called 'I'm Plus Size and I'm an Athlete'. Despite the fact triathlons and running event having heats for 'plus size endurance athletes' where 'tens of thousands' participate, Ms Gilbert said these categories of sporting people were yet to make it into the mainstream. 'Why is it that I am in a rather unique position when I present myself as a plus size endurance athlete? Why aren't we all out there seeking sponsorship or promoting our roles as athletes?' she wrote. 'It's easy. Most of us don't even acknowledge ourselves as athletes because we know that physically we don't fit the mould of what society believes an ""athlete"" looks like.' The 36-year-old says people need to stop considering athletes as being trim. She said people who are her size are athletes too . Ms Gilbert knows a lot better than some about body image, having weighed 140 kilograms at her heaviest, and kick-started her rise to exercise queen after she found she had osteoarthritis in 2012. Since finding out about her condition, she has trained for everything from club running events, sprint triathlons and half marathons. 'I just couldn't escape the condition. It had come from having a lot of weight on my joints for such a long time,' Ms Gilbert told Daily Mail Australia. 'I started out walking and then I started running up and down the side of the house while my daughter was asleep and then I progressed to running outside with her in a pram. 'The greatest thing that clicked for me is that I stopped what I was doing for weight loss and I started doing it to achieve what I had always dreamed of doing, which was becoming a runner. That was a greater thing for me.' Ms Gilbert trains for up to one hour twice a day, six days a week when she preparing for a sprint triathlon or a half marathon . Ms Gilbert said she wanted to speak out because she believed young people needed more curvy role models to admire and finally had the courage to speak out about her athleticism. 'I've always been big and I've always enjoyed playing sport from a young age,' she said. 'But because I was always such a big child I guess for everybody me just turning up was enough rather than being encouraged to try really hard at it. 'What tends to happen when you're a bigger person, you don't give yourself credit for physical activity. People struggle to marry the fitness with the physical body type. 'In the end we play it down... and cheapen our experience in fitness and sport. 'I want people to realise they have within themselves the potential to inspire others and do it without fear of judgement.' And it seems a lot of people agreed with Ms Gilbert's view point. She said the blog post had attracted many positive reactions from readers. 'It has been incredible - more than I ever expected,' Ms Gilbert told Daily Mail Australia. 'So many people said they spent the whole time nodding whilst they were reading it. Many people related with what I said about ""cheapening"" our athletic experiences and achievements. 'Others have thanked me for reminding them not to care about what they look like when they are competing and to just get out there and do their best.' Ms Gilbert said she wanted to speak out because she believed young people needed more curvy role models to admire and finally had the courage to speak out about her athleticism . Ms Gilbert said her training helped give her the mental resilience she needed to be 'willing to put myself out there'.

"A mother who is blind was able to see her newborn son for the very first time after using a special piece of high-tech eyewear. Kathy Beitz, 29, from Guelph, Ontario, was able to use a device that allowed her to see her baby just hours after he was born. In a YouTube video, that is quickly going viral, she gasps and says 'Oh my god!' as she holds baby Aksel in her hospital bed for the first time. 'Look at his long toes,' she says. 'I think he looks like us.' Scroll down for video... First look: Kathy Beitz, 29, is legally blind, but high-tech eyewear allowed her to see her son on the day he was born . You're beautiful: The video which has gone viral, captured the first time Kathy Beitz ever saw her baby . Sight for sore eyes: The eSight device is equipped with a video camera. The images captured from the camera are enhanced and projected onto high definition screens in front of the eyes . Ms. Beitz was diagnosed with Stargardt disease, a genetic condition that causes macular degeneration, when she was 11. While she now has some peripheral vision, she developed a blind spot in the centre of her field of vision and is legally blind. The special glasses developed by  the firm eSight is equipped with a video camera from which the images are enhanced and projected onto high definition screens in front of the eyes. About 140 people have eSight glasses in North America, . What a feeling: 'My husband and I got to have the family experience of looking at our brand new baby, and bonding with him and falling in love with him' Getting to know you: 'The moment I got the glasses, I was very ready to put them on,' said Beitz. 'I got to see that he had my husband's feet and toes, and I got to see that he had my lips' The wearer can then adjust the contrast, brightness and shadow to make things easier to see. 'Their eyes actually perceive more when they look at the screen than they can with their natural eyesight,' said Taylor West, a spokesman for eSight to CBC. 'For the first baby that I get to actually look at being my own is very overwhelming,' she told the camera. 'The moment I got the glasses, I was very ready to put them on,' said Ms Beitz. 'I got to see that he had my husband's feet and toes, and I got to see that he had my lips. 'My husband and I got to have the family experience of looking at our brand new baby, and bonding with him and falling in love with him.' The glasses have changed her life profoundly. She said they make it much easier for her to care for the infant, go to the grocery store and complete other tasks that would otherwise be difficult. Feeling every inch: The device, launched in 2013, sells for $15,000. The company has a fundraising department that helps people purchase the eyewear . Seeing is believing: The glasses cost $15,000 and work by capturing real-time video and enhancing it for the legally blind to see . What a view! Kathy Beitz has 20/2,400 vision. Legal blindness is defined as vision being worse than or equal to 20/200 vision with correction . At a cost of $15,000, the device doesn't come cheap, however, the company has a fundraising department that helps people purchase the glasses. The company is even trying to persuade insurers to make a contribution through healthcare plans. Ms. Beitz sister also suffers from Stargardt disease and now works for the company that developed the spectacles. She says she is forever grateful that her sister decided to purchase the glasses for her, although over time she will pay her back. A number of efforts are underway to help raise money for the device and include using crowdfunding. and a campaign based around Ms Beitz's story using the hash tag #MakeBlindnessHistory. 'Being a person with a disability who has two children of her own, she knew the struggles of being a legally blind or blind parent. So she was very adamant about getting the glasses for me and work with me to use them, so when I did have him, I got to experience everything that she didn't,' said Beitz. 'When I knew I was getting the glasses, I got very excited. I knew then I would be able to read books to the baby and be a part of that experience ... it gave a huge independence to my parenting skills.'","Kathy Beitz, 29, is legally blind - she lost her vision as a child and, for a long time, adapted to living in a world she couldn't see .

The outspoken former model holds nothing back in the interview as she reveals the difficulties of living with former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney, how it feels to be the dubbed ‘the most hated woman in Britain’ – and the bizarre moment her false leg fell off when she was on a ski lift. ‘I felt this “whoosh” from my trousers,’ she says. ‘Then there was a scream from behind with a kid shouting, “Her leg has dropped off!” ‘I was hopping around at the top of the lift and a snowboarder emerged carrying my leg shouting, “Whoa! Is this yours? That is so cool!” ’ Ms Mills lost her leg when she was knocked over by a police motorbike in 1993. But she says the amputation was ‘easier to cope with’ than her acrimonious 2008 divorce from Sir Paul. ‘When I woke up in hospital and was told I’d lost my leg I always knew I could cope,’ she says.

"Billionaire property investor Jeff Greene recently spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, saying he believes people in the United States need to stop aiming so high and start living with less. 'America's lifestyle expectations are far too high and need to be adjusted so we have less things and a smaller, better existence,' Greene, who ran for the Democratic Senate nomination in Florida in 2010, said in an interview. 'We need to reinvent our whole system of life.' The only issue Americans took with the 60-year-old's opinions was, well, everything, given he owns a $195 million palace in Beverly Hills, which has 23 bathrooms and a rotating dance floor, as well as four other blue ribbon properties, and is famous for throwing wild parties on a 145-foot yacht, Yahoo! Homes reported. Scroll down for video . This is 'living with less'?: Billionaire property investor Jeff Greene, 60, who recently said the 'lifestyle expectations of Americans is far too high', is the owner of America's most expensive home - this Beverly Hills estate - which is listed for $195 million . Lifestyles of the rich: Jeff Greene is seen here with his wife, Mei Sze Greene, at an event in New York in August . Aerial: The property comes complete with a vineyard that produces private label wine from 'top grapes' Greene's claim to real estate fame is the Palazzo di Amore, or Palace of Love, that sits on 25 acres in Beverly Hills and includes a vineyard that produces 400 to 500 cases of private label wine a year. It became the most expensive home in the U.S. last year when Greene listed it for $195 million. The main house is 35,000-square-feet, with 12 bedrooms, including a master suite measuring 5,000-square-feet. There is a a 15,000-square-foot entertainment center with a bowling alley, 50-seat theater, a 10,000-bottle cellar and a kitchen with a walk-in fridge. Greene paid $35 million for the property in 2007 when it was unfinished, and has since spent between $25 and $40 million completing it. Beach house: Greene also owns this Malibu home, which is currently for sale at $11.5 million . Bungalow: The house backs onto the beach in Malibu and is where Greene often stays . However, the estate is often rented out to royal families and other visiting internationals for hundreds of thousands of dollars a month, and Greene and his wife, Chinese-Australian real estate executive Mei Sze Chan, usually spend their time at a more modest beach-front abode in Malibu. Greene built the three-story modern bungalow in 2010. The home has four bedroom, windows throughout overlooking the ocean, and backs right onto the sand. It is currently listed as for sale at $11.5 million. Prime real estate: When not in California, Greene spends time at this sprawling estate in Palm Beach, Florida . Greene also keeps a prized home in that other luxury real estate mecca, Palm Beach, Florida. There he has a trophy property called La Bellucia - or 'beautiful lady' - which he bought in 2009 for $24 million. The estate dates back to 1920. The main house has nine bedrooms and, like the Malibu home, backs straight onto the water. And, also like his other properties, he performed extensive renovations to expand the existing structure. At the time of the purchase, Greene's estimated fortune was $1.3 billion, which ranked him him as number 317 on the list of the 400 Richest Americans in 2009. Spacious: In 2011 Greene purchased this parcel of land in New Haven, New York, for $36 million . An entrepreneur like Greene would not consider his portfolio complete without a house in Hamptons. And in 2011 he completed that by buying a sprawling 55-acre peninsula in New Haven known as Tyndal Point. The purchase gave Greene three separate houses, two docks, and 3,000 feet of private beach. The initial price was rumored to be $41 million, but Curbed later reported that the final sale was $36 million. Bachelor pad: Before getting married, Greene resided in this Beverly Hills house, which comes complete with a dance club . Greene's fifth property is his oldest. Bought in 2002, before his 2007 marriage, the Beverly Hills abode has come to called Greene's 'bachelor pad'. Yahoo reported the house has five bedrooms and, as every single man needs, a 1,000-bottle wine cellar and a dance club. Greene paid $1.575 million for it and, after languishing on the market for years, recently offloaded it for $8.9 million. Expert: Greene reportedly manages about $2 billion in financial investments, more than $750 million in real estate and at least $1.5 billion in assorted property development projects . Greene's controversial comments at the World Economic Forum came during an interview with Bloomberg. In it he said he said the United States is facing a job crisis that is going to lead to social unrest. Greene said Greene says he  manages about $2 billion in financial investments, more than $750 million in real estate and at least $1.5 billion in assorted property development projects. And he does it all on his own, without investors or partners, he said. 'I'm remarkably long for my level of pessimism,' he said. 'Our economy is in deep trouble. 'We need to be honest with ourselves. 'We've had a realistic level of job destruction, and those jobs aren't coming back.'","Jeff Greene, 60, is a billionaire property investor and entrepreneur .

"A British grandmother convicted of smuggling drugs to Bali in Indonesia fears she may face the firing squad within weeks. Lindsay Sandiford, 58, believes her execution is now imminent after she was asked to sign a court document tomorrow that formally confirms her death sentence. Yorkshire-born Sandiford, who was convicted of smuggling cocaine in 2013, fears it could effectively fast-track her execution after Indonesia’s new president Joko Widodo pledged to show no mercy to foreigners convicted of drug crimes. Scroll down for video . Lindsay Sandiford, 58, (pictured behind bars being visited by her sister Hilary Parsons) believes her execution is now imminent after she was asked to sign a court document tomorrow that formally confirms her death sentence . Indonesia began a wave of executions last Sunday with five foreigners, including a Dutchman and a Brazilian, killed by firing squad. Days later, the second of two Australians on Death Row in the same prison as Sandiford in Bali had their clemency appeals rejected. Andrew Chan, 31, and Myuran Sukumaran, 33, are now expected to be shot dead next month. The deadline for Sandiford, who has two sons in their 20s and a granddaughter aged two, to file an application for clemency passed five months ago and she now fears she will face a firing squad at the same time as the Australians. Speaking from Bali’s Kerobokan Prison, Sandiford told her sister Hilary Parsons in a phone conversation: ‘If I sign the letter, am I signing my own death warrant? Am I saying, “Go ahead and shoot me?” The letter is in Indonesian so I won’t even know what it says.’ Sandiford has no legal representation after the British Government refused to fund a lawyer for her, and yesterday she wrote to Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond asking him to reverse his decision not to pay the £38,000 costs of another appeal against her sentence. Death-row Australians Andrew Chan, 31, (left) and Myuran Sukumaran, 33, are expected to be shot dead next month after having their clemency appeals rejected; they are in the same Bali prison as Sandiford . British judges previously ruled that she should be considered an ‘exceptional’ case after she was sentenced to death while the ring-leaders of the same drug-smuggling gang escaped with jail terms. Former legal secretary Sandiford, who has no previous criminal convictions, was caught smuggling cocaine worth £1.6 million from Thailand to Bali in 2012. Her sentence was upheld on appeal. She claims she was forced to act as a drugs mule by a syndicate who threatened the lives of her sons in England. The other suspected syndicate members – Julian Ponder, 45, Paul Beales, 41, and Rachel Dougall, 41 – were sentenced to six years, four years and one year respectively. Five Supreme Court judges in London last July called on Hammond to ‘urgently’ consider providing legal assistance to Sandiford, concluding that the Indonesian courts had ignored substantial mitigating factors in her case. Hammond wrote to Sandiford in a letter dated August 11 dismissing the judges’ suggestion and saying features of her case were ‘regrettably present in many other cases in which British nationals have been sentenced to death overseas’.","Lindsay Sandiford is to sign a document tomorrow confirming her death .

"America's most lethal sniper claimed he wished he'd 'killed more' Iraqis despite accumulating 160 confirmed kills - with the true number estimated to be as high as 255. Speaking just months before his untimely death, Chris Kyle insisted his only regret was that US lives were lost because he shot too few of the enemy. The late veteran's wartime exploits are portrayed in the divisive Oscar-tipped movie American Sniper, starring Bradley Cooper and directed by Clint Eastwood. Little regrets: In an interview three years ago America's most lethal sniper Chris Kyle claimed he wished he'd 'killed more' Iraqis . Speaking to Toby Harnden of The Sunday Times three years ago, Kyle was asked whether he regretted any of his kills while on tour. Replying in his characteristically soft Texan drawl, the former sniper, said: 'No, sir, not at all. 'To be honest with you, I wish I'd killed more because every kill saved American lives and that was what I was out there for.' Kyle was thrilled by the success of his autobiographical book, which led to 'huge fascination' with the grisly art of snipers. The soldier, played by Bradley Cooper in Oscar-tipped film American Sniper (L), accumulated 160 confirmed kills in Iraq, with the true number estimated to be as high as 255 . In the 2012 interview, he added: 'It's been a taboo for too long, I'm glad that people are actually looking at it with an interest and saying these guys are actually something we need.' Less than a year after the conversation, Kyle was killed on a remote shooting range in Texas by a disturbed veteran he was helping, who was said to have been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Opinion: Seth Rogen caused a Twitter storm with a tweet about American Sniper . The movie based on Kyle's book, produced by and starring Bradley Cooper, has been a box office hit, but has also divided opinion, with some criticising the film's jingoistic stance. Filmmaker Michael Moore caused an online debate when he tweeted about how he was raised to believe snipers were 'cowards' since his uncle died by a Japanese sniper shot in World War II. Taking to Twitter in rage, the Fahrenheit 9/11 director seethed: 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse.' Seth Rogen also caused controversy after tweeting: 'American Sniper kind of reminds me of the movie that's showing in the third act of Inglorious Basterds.' The comedy actor faced a storm of online abuse for his comment and recently issued a clarification and apology. He wrote: ‘It appears I need to further clarify a tweet I sent a few days ago. 'I said a sniper movie kind of reminded me of a scene in another movie that involved a sniper movie. 'I didn't compare the two at all. I merely said that one kind of reminded me of the other, because they both involved plots about the most lethal of snipers. ‘People then claimed that I compared the movie American Sniper to Nazi propaganda, something I would never do. 'I'm sorry if this somehow offended anyone, but that was not my intention. I hope this clears things up.’ Critics of the movie included talk show host Bill Maher, who claimed the film is only cleaning up at the box office because audiences lap up its 'psychopath' hero. Controversy: Rogen said American Sniper (still on the right) reminded him of Nation's Pride (still on the left), a fake Nazi propaganda film from Quentin Tarantino's World War II film Inglorious Basterds . Speaking on his HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher, he drew on excerpts from the autobiography Kyle wrote before he was killed in February 2013, in which he said he enjoyed war and referred to his targets as 'savages'. Kid Rock was one of the first stars to wade in on the debate stirred up by Rogen and Moore, tweeting: ‘: 'F— you Michael Moore, you’re a piece of s— and your uncle would be ashamed of you. Seth Rogen, your uncle probably molested you. I hope both of you catch a fist to the face soon. 'God bless you Chris Kyle, Thank you for your service.' 'Psychopath patriot - and we love him': Talk show host Bill Maher was uncompromising in his criticism of Kyle - and seized . Oscar-tipped: Clint Eastwood's (left) movie is hotly-tipped to pick up a few Oscars, including Best Actor for Cooper (right) He chose parts of the book, also called American Sniper, where Kyle said 'I love killing bad guys - even with the pain I loved what I was doing.' The film, directed by Clint Eastwood, was then compared with Hurt Locker, another film centered on the Iraq war which made far less money, though won widespread praise. Maher said: 'Hurt Locker' made $17million because it was a little ambiguous and thoughtful... [American Sniper] is just ""American hero! He's a psychopath patriot, and we love him.""' American Sniper has earned six Oscar nominations, including Best Actor for Bradley Cooper.","America's most lethal sniper made comment in interview three years ago .

"The immaculate uniform, trench maps and belongings of a First World War officer have been discovered in his 'time capsule' trunk nearly 100 years after they were last folded away. The set of items includes the neatly folded uniform of Lieutenant Howard Hands, his officer's cap, belts, cigarette case, photographs, newspapers and even his bedpan. His own trench maps showing a network of secret tunnels and mine galleries that ran under enemy positions on the Western Front were also found in the stash. Scroll down for video . Lieutenant Howard Hands (second from left, seated) was a signals officer in the Royal Engineers . The time capsule of Lt Hands (pictured) was discovered in storage at a school's history department . Included in the stash was Lt Hands' (left) perfectly preserved and folded First World War uniform (right) Lt Hands was a signals officer in the Royal Engineers and spent much of the war operating underground, helping with the laying of communication cables and mines. The 2.5ft wide metal trunk has recently been found in storage in the history department at the Highfield School in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, the town where Lt Hands was from. Although it's a mystery as to how it got there, it is believed it was donated to the school by a member of Lt Hands' family, probably a grandchild, over 30 years ago. The trunk is now the focus of a history project at the school and will go on display at the Herts at War exhibition - a Lottery-funded project to tell untold stories relating to the First World War. Lt Hands fought throughout the First World War and served in every major theatre including Egypt, Palestine, Iraq and the Western Front. He collected copies of newspapers from each country he served in, including a rare edition of the Balkan News, a satirical paper for British troops similar to the Wipers Times but not as well known. As a commanding officer he oversaw the laying of communication cables, mine galleries and maintaining vital communications links with the Front line trenches. He was awarded the coveted Military Cross in the New Year's honours list in 1919 for his gallant conduct over a sustained period of time during the war. Other items found in the trunk included pocket manuals, newspapers and a satchel . Lt Hands also collected newspapers (pictured) from every theatre of war he fought in, including Egypt, Palestine, Iraq and the Western Front . Maps found in the container showed trench lines and tunnels that ran under enemy territory . A rare copy of the Balkan News (pictured) was found in the trunk. The publication was a satirical newspaper for British troops . Dan Hill, of Herts at War, said: 'The items in the collection relating to the Lieutenant Hands offer a fascinating glimpse into the life of a man who rose from the ranks to become an officer and whose entire military career and personal artefacts are contained within the trunk. 'To find something of this nature is now very rare and to see these items in such good condition almost a century on really brings the history to life. 'Howard's war was incredibly varied; he saw service in every major theatre and the newspapers, hand-marked trench maps and personal effects that he chose to preserve form a poignant time-capsule of one man's life in The Great War. ' 'Howard's wartime experiences and his movements are a great reminder of the fact that the First World War was not only fought in the muddy fields of Flanders but also in the deserts and mountains in locations across the globe'. John Grant, head of history at the secondary school, uncovered the trunk.

The rare stash of items is now the focus of a history project at The Highfield School in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, and will go on display at the Herts at War exhibition . 'Recently we have been able to share this incredible time-capsule with students when teaching about The Great War and for them to be able to interact with artefacts from a man who experienced the war first-hand, yet called the same town home, has been a hugely beneficial experience. 'We hope that Howard himself would have been pleased that his possessions would go on to teach others.' After leaving the army, Lt Hands worked as a designer for the aircraft industry and then set up the oilfield engineering company Hands-England. He died while on holiday in Zimbabwe in the 1950s at the age of 69.","First World War officer's time capsule found stored at Letchworth school .

"Pope Francis has urged people to put away their iPhones and start talking  as he warned his new cardinals to avoid lavish parties which stun 'worse than grappa on an empty stomach'. He said a great challenge facing people today is learning how to talk to one another again, rather than simply generating and consuming information on social media sites. In his annual message for the church's World Day of Communications, Francis said media can  help family members keep in touch, but also enable others to avoid one another. Pope Francis has urged people to put away their iPhones and start talking to each other again, pictured during an audience in the Paul VI hall, Vatican City, on Wednesday . He said a great challenge facing people today is learning how to talk to one another again, rather than simply generating and consuming information, pictured posing for a 'selfie' during an audience at the Vatican . 'The great challenge facing us today is to learn once again how to talk to one another, not simply how to generate and consume information,' he said. The Pope said children first learn to communicate in the family and work out how to get along with people of different ages and experience. As a result, he said, families are the model for all communications as it is in the family where children first learn to forgive. 'A perfect family does not exist,' he said. 'We should not be fearful of imperfections, weaknesses or even conflict, but rather learn how to deal with them constructively.' The Pope said children first learn to communicate in the family, pictured shows a man using a 'selfie stick' to get the best picture . Francis also warned the new cardinals to avoid ostentatious festivities that 'stun worse than grappa on an empty stomach' In a letter written to the 20 new princes of the church he also told them to avoid ostentatious festivities that 'stun worse than grappa on an empty stomach' after they are formally elevated. Traditionally new cardinals are thrown lavish parties in Rome, often funded by  parishioners, after the Vatican ceremony where they receive their red hats -  expected to take place next month. Francis, known for his personal simplicity, said it would be fine to celebrate but urged his new cardinals to accept a party 'with humility' and keep their egos in check. 'Maintaining humility in service isn't easy if you consider being a cardinal as a prize, as the culmination of a career or a superior power,' he said in the letter published in the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano. He has frequently spoken out against careerism in the church.","Pope Francis said people should put away their  iPhones and Twitter feeds .

"The lawyer for a NYU student accused of setting his classmate's bed on fire while she slept claims the victim could have been participating because she was drunk. Part-time real estate agent Jaime Castano, 20, allegedly burned the 19-year-old's mattress in his dorm room last August while singing to her, recording the incident on a cell phone and posting it on Snapchat. At his arraignment last week, the student's attorney Alyssa Gamliel suggested the victim had blacked out during a booze binge and may have been complicit, according to the New York Daily News. Allegations: Jaime Castano, 20, has been accused of setting fire to the to the 19-year-old's (not pictured) mattress in NYU accomodation last August while singing her, recording the incident and posting it on Snapchat . 'I do not think she knows what happened or her participation in this, nor do I think the People will be able to prove that she was not sort of participating in some of this activity,' she told a judge at Manhattan Criminal Court on Tuesday. The teenager suffered 'painful burns and scarring to her torso', it was alleged in a criminal complaint. However Gamliel argues that the injuries became infected because she failed to treat them and could have been a result of her 'continued behavior of intoxication'. The victim claims she and a third person were with Castano at his dorm room on Lafayette Street when she fell asleep at about 11pm on August 23. Case: If convicted of first-degree assault, Castano could be jailed for up to 25 years . At around 6am the following the morning she woke to find holes and burn marks on her bed and blankets, burns on her clothes, and painful burns on her body, prosecutors told the broadcaster. But she wasn't aware of what caused the fire until she saw Castano's video, which he had shared with the photo-messaging application, it is claimed . The victim reported the attack to university officials but they did not alert police until October 27 - more than two months after it allegedly occurred. If convicted of first-degree assault, Castano could be jailed for up to 25 years. He was expelled by NYU in September after an internal investigation, although his attorney told the judge Monday that he left the private university voluntarily.

"This is the shocking moment two men chained up and abandoned a pit bull outside a supermarket in freezing temperatures - prompting her to chew off her own paw in a desperate bid to escape. The fugitive suspects, who are yet to be identified, were captured on surveillance video dumping the mixed-breed dog, named by rescuers as Courtney, outside a Wal-Mart in Detroit, Michigan. They then drove off, leaving the animal alone in the frigid weather, with a thick cable around her leg. As she grew colder, it is believed Courtney chewed off and ate her numb paw to try to escape. Fortunately, the two-year-old dog was later rescued by a horrified store employee, who stumbled across her in a bloodied state and called the police. Officers then notified Animal Control. Scroll down for video . Wanted: Two men are captured on surveillance video driving up to the exterior of a Wal-Mart in Michigan . Horrific: The pair then grab hold of a pit bull, named by rescuers as Courtney, and dump her on the ground . Ready to go: They then drive off, leaving the animal alone in the frigid weather, with a cable around her leg . Saved: As she grew colder, it is believed Courtney chewed off and ate her numb paw to try to escape. Above, the pit bull is pictured at the offices of the rescue charity 4 Paws 1 Heart following her rescue last Sunday . During an examination, vets found part of Courtney's paw in her stomach. They believe the cord was wrapped around her leg so tightly it may have stopped blood gushing from the wound. Although Courtney did not chew off her entire paw during her ordeal last Sunday, vets decided to amputate her leg, deeming it the most humane course of action to avoid the risk of infection. Diana Rascano, the president and co-founder of rescue charity 4 Paws 1 Heart told the Detroit Free Press: 'They thought the toxins could have easily gotten into her blood system.' She added that following the amputation, vets examined Courtney's stomach. 'They felt a lump in her stomach and saw there were shards of bones, which were her paw,' she said. Freezing: The two-year-old dog was rescued by a horrified store employee, who stumbled across her in a bloodied state and called the police. Above, Courtney is seen tied up in the cold outside the Wal-Mart store . Fleeing the scene: On Saturday, the surveillance footage was released in a bid to help Roseville Police track down the two men who apparently left Courtney to die.

Maltreatment: Although Courtney did not chew off her entire paw during her ordeal last Sunday, vets decided to amputate her leg to avoid the risk of infection. Above, Courtney is pictured following the amputation . 'She had not only chewed it but eaten it. They had to do surgery because the shards from the bone could have caused issues with her intestine.' Incredibly, Courtney is now recuperating from her injuries and is expected to make a full recovery. The pit bull is currently being looked after at Wittner's Hopeful Heart Rescue home. After she has completely recovered, she will be adopted via the home, Click On Detroit reported. On Saturday, the surveillance footage of the local Wal-Mart's exterior was released in a bid to help Roseville Police track down the two men who apparently left Courtney to die in the cold.

On the road to health: Incredibly, Courtney is now recuperating from her injuries and is expected to make a full recovery. Above, she is pictured with a charity worker at 4 Paws 1 Heart following her various surgeries . Speaking of the horrific footage, Ms Rascano said: 'The leash, it was like a cable, it was very thick and had tied around her leg and actually acted as a tourniquet. 'The vet said what saved her was the tourniquet that caused the blood flow to stop. And the subfreezing weather may have frozen some of the wound so that she didn't bleed to death.' She added that Courtney is a 'sweetheart' who has not let her traumatic experience impact her friendly demeanor. 'She's been walking around licking everyone. She's just the sweetest dog,' she said. A police investigation is ongoing.","Surveillance video released on Saturday in bid to track down suspects .

"Dr. Ben Carson, a pediatric surgeon-turned-politician, emerged as a major conservative darling on Saturday in Iowa by harping on the Obama administration's immigraton and health care policy – and saying a new approach to energy could put Russian Presdient Vladimir Putin 'back in his little box.' The long-shot potential White House hopeful drew the biggest ovations by far at the morning session of the Iowa Freedom Summit, as GOP presidential hopefuls jockeyed for position. 'We need to use our natural resources' to generate a new economic recovery, Carson said. 'We're the number one producer of oil now, on 3 per cent of the land! The federal governmnt has no business owning all this land. This is craziness!' The thousand-plus crowd roared. 'And all the natural gas we have! Now we have the ability to liquefy natural gas,' Carson reminded them, 'which means we can export it.' 'THIS IS CRAZINESS!': Ben Carson said Saturday that federal public lands should be in private hadns so they can be tapped for oil and gas . IN A BOX: Russian President Vladimir Putin's economic running room is getting smaller as oil prices drop, and Carson says America should tighten the screws even more . John Bolton, a former US ambassador to the United Nations, said Russia is in an ever-tighter spot as oil prices fall – whether from Saudi price manipulation or American drilling and fracking . Then the soft-spoken man with a dramatic following and a fundraising-savvy 'draft' movement pushing him to run took aim at Russia. 'We need to use those energy resources not only to enhance our economic situation, but also to pay down our debt – and to put Putin back in his little box, y'know?' Plummeting oil prices on the global market, driven by a Saudi Arabian strategy designed to cripple Iran, have also created a near-existential crisis in Moscow. In June 2014 the price of a barrel of Brent crude hovered near $115. On Friday it was $49. While Russia has its conglomerate natural gas production to fall back on, its economy has faltered more as the bottom of the oil market slips lower. And U.S. economic sanctions leveled after military incursions into neighboring Ukraine have added to Putin's headaches. Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, who spoke after lunch, told Daily Mail Online in an interview on the summit's sidelines that 'The Russians live hand to mouth with their oil revenues, as do the Iranians, and who knows what could happen if prices plummet again and again?' 'I think the Saudis' main target in allowing the price to fall was Iran, but they got a lot of collateral damage out of it as well – in Russia, in Venezuela, in Algeria.' Bolton also cited 'our fracking here' as a factor. 'While the Saudis, the Emiratis, the Kuwaitis and others can sustain for some considerable period of time oil at this level, it has an immediate palpable effect on Iran and russia and others.' 'And I think the Saudis understood that.' Carson believes the United States should grasp the idea too, and use it as a foreign affairs sledgehammer. He got bigger applause with a proposal to shrink the federal government 'by attrition.' 'Thousands of government employees retire every year. Don't replace them,' he said. 'You do that for about four or five years, and all of a sudden you've got the government down to a manageable size ... They won't have time to stick their big noses in everybody's business. 'The government tries to insert itself into everything,' he emphasized. 'They want to tell you how to take care of your children, what you should feed them, how you should discipline them.' 'You know what? I would be happy to accept the advice of the government if they were doing everything perfectly.' Carson spoke at the Iowa Freedom Summit on January 24 in Des Moines, Iowa as a host of potential 2016 Republican presidential candidates jousted on core conservative principles . RUSSIA NEXT?  Sliding oil prices have sent Venezuela on a downward spiral and sent President Nicolas Maduro on a trip to China to make an urgent appeal for cash; government-controlled supermarkets are limiting what citizens can purchase as the bottom falls out of the nations economy . And the rafters shook when he gave a quiet but firm sermon on immigration policy – squarely targeting President Barack Obama's plan to mainstream 5 million or more illegal immigrants with residency IDs and work permits. 'We already have laws that demonstrate how a person becomes an American citizen,' Carson said. 'We don't need to relitigate that.' 'If we do relitigate that, it has to be by the proper branch of government – Congress – not by the president, not by the Supreme Court.' Whichever Republican wins the White House – his assumption – 'should make it their goal to seal that border within a year,' he intoned. 'Do we have the ability to seal the border? Sure we do. We just don't have the will to seal the border.' He insisted, though, that Republicans should 'integrate compassion' into their immigration policy and give illegal immigrants a pathway to work in the U.S. – under certain strict circumstances. 'I don't think they should have to hide in the shadows,' he said, pointing to Canada's guest worker program as a model. 'We shouldn't offer jobs unless Americans won't take them. And in order to get a guest worker permit, you have to apply for it from outside of America.' 'You shouldn't get an advantage for breaking the law,' he said. DRILL, BABY, DRILL: Saudi Arabia dropped oil prices by more than half in order to cripple regional rival Iran – but Russia, Venezuela and Algeria have become collateral damage . Carson leaped into the national consciousness in 2013 by saying during a National Prayer Breakfast speech that the Affordable Care Act – Obamacare – was the worst thing to happen to the United States 'since slavery.' Carson, an African-American, said so with a more famous black man, President Obama, sitting two seats away. 'We do not need the government controlling our healthcare,' he reiterated on Saturday. 'Even if it worked, I would oppose it. [But] it doesn't.' 'I don't believe in taking the most important thing a person has, which is their health, their healthcare, and putting it in the hands of the government,' Carson said, 'because if they control your healthcare, it's not long before they control your whole life.' 'And that changes the entire relationship.'","America should drill for more oil and gas, and sell public lands to do it, said the African-American presidential long-shot with a cult-like following .

"An explosive row has erupted between diplomats and Ministers over their reluctance to help a British man on death row in Ethiopia. A series of extraordinary emails, obtained by The Mail on Sunday, reveal officials’ increasing frustration at political inaction over Andargachew Tsege. Tsege, 59, a father-of-three from London, was snatched at an airport in Yemen last June and illegally rendered to Ethiopia. There are concerns he may have been tortured. Family torn apart: Kidnapped Briton Andargachew Tsege with wife Yemi and their children, before his abduction . Yet Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond's office said he could not ‘find time’ for a phone call to raise the issue and did not want to send a ‘negative’ letter. In one email, an exasperated official asks: ‘Don’t we need to do more than give them a stern talking to?’ Tsege, who has lived in the UK since 1979, has been called Ethiopia’s Nelson Mandela. Tsege fell out with his university friend ex-Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, after he exposed government corruption and helped establish a pro-democracy party. In 2009, he was sentenced to death in his absence for allegedly plotting a coup and planning to kill Ethiopian officials – claims he denies. He was abducted on June 23 while en route to Eritrea, emerging two weeks later in Ethiopia, where he has since been paraded on TV. It is not known where he is being held. The diplomatic exchanges disclose how officials were dismayed when British Ministers rejected requests to raise the case with Ethiopia in a firm and robust manner. ‘I feel so shocked and let down,’ said Tsege’s wife Yemi Hailemariam. ‘I thought Britain was a nation driven by fairness but it seems my husband’s life is simply not valued.’ The series of emails begins on July 1, with Foreign Office officials confirming his capture: ‘His detention in Yemen is significant news, and could get complicated for the UK.’ Yemi Hailemariam is campaigning for the release of her husband . Diplomats noted that neither Yemen nor Ethiopia informed Britain about the rendition of its citizen. ‘It feels a bit like I’m throwing the kitchen sink at the Yemenis but I want them to think twice before they do this again,’ wrote one senior figure at the British Embassy in Addis Ababa. He also noted that a prominent Ethiopian minister had given assurances over Tsege’s treatment –‘but I wouldn’t take them with complete confidence’. Ethiopia has claimed Tsege tried to recruit other Britons to become involved in terrorism. But the regime has used anti-terror laws to jail journalists and silence political rivals, and UK officials had not seen credible evidence. One diplomatic cable says: ‘All we have seen are a few pictures of him standing in an Eritrean village – hardly proof that he was engaged in terrorist training.’ Three weeks after Tsege’s kidnap, the Foreign Office’s Africa director wrote that Ministers ‘have so far shied away from talking about consequences... their tone has been relatively comfortable’. On July 21, Hammond’s office was still reluctant to talk to his Ethiopian counterpart on the phone. ‘I don’t think we are going to be able to find time for that at the moment,’ wrote his private secretary. He also turned down sending a ‘negative’ letter, asking for it to be rewritten ‘setting out areas of co-operation. It can end with a paragraph on the Tsege case.’ Despite concerns over Ethiopia’s human rights record, the nation receives £376 million a year in UK aid. One farmer there is suing Britain, claiming the money was used to usurp him from his land. Hammond is believed to have finally called his counterpart at the end of July, one month after the kidnap. It is understood he focused on requesting consular access rather than condemning the capture. Reprieve, which campaigns against the death penalty said: ‘These shocking emails show the Foreign Secretary appears to have blocked any meaningful action that could potentially bring this British father home to his family, unharmed.’ The Foreign Office said they were ‘deeply concerned’ by Tsege’s detention and were lobbying for further consular access as well as seeking confirmation the death penalty would not be carried out. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said he could not ‘find time’ for a phone call to raise the issue and did not want to send a ‘negative’ letter .","Andargachew Tsege was snatched by officials at Yemen airport last June .

"After her month-long imprisonment in a Chinese jail late last year, Sydney woman Kalynda Davis' life appears to have returned to normal. Ms Davis was arrested at Guangzhou International Airport in southern China on November 8, along with travel companion Peter Gardner, 25, and the pair were accused of smuggling 'ice' - the drug crystal methamphetamine. They had met in dating app Tinder weeks earlier and decided to take a last-minute trip to China before heading back home.

'I'm blessed n thankfull I have this girl back home n in my life, best friends for life (sic)', he wrote earlier this month. Mr Stella went on to describe the emotion he felt when he discovered he may never see Ms Davis again, saying he felt truly 'blessed' to have her back. She has been spending time with her close friend Dan Stella who is ecstatic to have Ms Davis home . The pair visited Naru Beach in Newcastle together in the first week of 2015, with Ms Davis joking she wanted to forget how sunburnt she was after spending the day in the sun. Mr Stella likened Ms Davis' return to 'winning the lottery' to which she replied 'love you so much' and 'Makes each time we spend together so much more special'. A video montage of pictures of the pair was also uploaded by Mr Stella, alongside a caption which read in part 'endless smile on my face ... #tearsofhappiness'.

"The Conservatives have come under fire for another 'dodgy' election advert after critics accused them of fattening-up Ed Miliband. Commentators also slammed the Tories latest poster for its poor photoshop, which saw them switch Ed Ball's head for Alex Salmond's. The latest own-goal comes after Tory spin doctors used a German road in a poster that claimed Britain is on the 'road to a stronger economy.' Scroll down for video . The Tories have come under fire for their latest election poster, pictured above,  for its poor photoshop . On social networking sites people accused the Conservatives of being 'skinflints' and branded the latest poster 'terrible.' Others suggested the Tories had put the Labour leader in a 'fat suit.' The poster, released on Friday,  targets both Labour and the Scottish National Party. Miliband has refused to rule out an alliance with Scottish nationalists. It tells voters: 'The SNP would prop up Ed Miliband - meaning chaos for Britain.' Above the doctored image of Miliband and former SNP leader Alex Salmond hugging, it reads. 'Your Worst nightmare... just got worse.' The original image was of Miliband and the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, embracing in front of a pink backdrop. At the beginning of the month the Conservatives unveiled their first poster of the election campaign claiming that Britain is on the road to a stronger economy. The image, depicting an empty road carving through green field, was initially criticised for being 'a bit French.' The new image shows the Miliband hugging the former Scottish National Party leader, Alex Salmond . Original image: In the original picture the Labour leader was embracing Ed Balls . But the Chancellor George Osborne was left with some explaining to do, after it was revealed that the image used was actually German and taken by photographer Alexander Burzik in Weimar. Some efforts were made to cover up the deception. The entire image was flipped, cracks and discoloration removed from the road surface and the white lines erased. The white clouds in the blue sky were also rearranged. The words on the image also caused problems for Mr Cameron, with the claim: 'The deficit halved'. It infuriated some experts, who pointed out that the deficit – the annual gap between the Government's spending and income – has been reduced from a peak of £153billion at the time of the election to £91billion this year, a fall of just over 40 per cent. Back in March last year Osborne was forced to defend another advert aimed at working class voters, claiming 'they' enjoy bingo and cheap beer. It was widely mocked online, and spawned spoof versions referring to whippets, clogs, eating swans, shooting poor people and suggesting the Tories think it is still 1961. The advert read: ‘Bingo! Cutting the bingo tax and beer duty to help hardworking people do more of the things they enjoy. A spokesman for the Conservative party today 'categorically' denied that they had done anything to alter Miliband's appearance in their latest poster . 'We definitely didn't do anything to it,' he said. 'The picture obviously just caught him from the wrong angle.' The spokesman refused to discuss the quality photoshop, saying he did 'not notice it' and he suspected that it was produced by a graphic designer. David Cameron unveiled the controversial 'Let's stay on the road to a stronger recovery' poster at the beginning of the year .

"Ted Cruz is running for president, unless he's engaged in a method-acting experiment to prepare for a movie role – as a senator who's running for president by channeling his preacher father. At the Iowa Freedom Summit, the Texas Republican senator boomed a Reaganesque sermon complete with G-rated jokes, scripture references – 'You shall know them by their fruits – and an altar call of sorts. 'Text the word ""Constitution"",' he implored, to a specific number. It was an Obama-like organizing stroke that no one else at the Saturday conservative cattle call thought of. But then no one else shouted with with consistency that occasional moments of normal volume were packed with whisper-like drama. Love him or hate him, Ted Cruz is a powerful communicator. The Princeton graduate has a debating award named for him there. He worked without notes and hired hands followed his departure from the stage by re-erecting the omnipresent teleprompter. He was one of only a few speakers who asked for it to be moved out of the way. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . FIRE AND BRIMSTONE: Sen. Ted Cruz could be mistaken for a revival-tent preacher on Saturday in Iowa as he quoted scripture, shared his father's Christian conversion story and insisted America is a 'blessed' nation . Cruz hammered President Obama for his foreign policy in a speech that's likely to be a preview of an aggressive campaign to inherit his Oval Office desk . The thousand-plus tea party sympathizers attracted by the promise of hearing – maybe – the next president, exploded at the first mention of his name by emcee David Bossie. 'God bless the great state of Iowa!' Cruz practically exploded back once his applause calmed. Iowa Rep. Steve King brought two dozen speakers to Des Moines for the one-day event, including firebrands Sarah Palin and Donald Trump, and outsiders Ben Carson and John Bolton, and perennial candidates Mike Huckabee and Rick Perry. 'Steve and I spent all week in Washington, D.C.,' Cruz said of his Iowa host. 'So it's great to be back in America.' It's an old joke, one that Cruz has told for more than a year at public gatherings. But it was new to this audience. Just like his constantly recycled story about what to do with the hated Internal Revenue Service. 'There are 110,000 employees at the IRS,' he said Saturday. 'We need to padlock that building and put every one of those 110,000 on our southern border.' HALLELUJAH: Sen. Ted Cruz played religious fervor to the hilt in Des Moines on Saturday, peppering his speech at the Iowa Freedom Summit with G-rated jokes . The idea, he said, was to put illegal immigrants face to face with the thing Americans fear most – an army of IRS agents – and send them screaming back to Mexico. The senator knows his crowd, and he held them like a practiced sermonizer and let his Christianity hang out. At the mention of Jesus three-quarters of them applauded. 'From the beginning of this country,' Cruz said, 'God's providential bessings have been on the United States of America.' He credited the almighty for beating the British, sewing America back together after a bloody Civil War and defeating Naziism. ''When we stood up with Winston Churchill ... it was only with God's blessings that we saved freedom,' he said, . He torched the White House for suing the Little Sisters of the Poor over their anti-Obamacare civil disobedience. 'If you're litigating against nuns, as the Obama administration is, you're probably doing something wrong,' Cruz snarked. And at the end of a story about how he helped organize 50 Houston pastors to stand with five others whose sermon notes were subpoenaed by the city government, Cruz was a trumpet on legs. 'Caesar has no jurisdiction over the pulpit,' he preached. 'When you subpoena one pastor, you subpoena every pastor.' His biggest applause line – one that brought the crowd to its feet en masse, was a call to strip U.S. citizenship from Americans who 'take up arms with ISIS,' the Middle Eastern terror army. But most of his stump material was in the vernacular of the church-going. His own redemption story involves his father, who abandoned him and his mother in Calgary and moved to Houston alone. Cruz the elder later found God and then returned to raise his son and regain his marriage. He's now a pastor. He might also be the senator's greatest political liability – his Jeremiah Wright – catnip for the political left. HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM: Paster Rafael Cruz (left), the senator's father, has made statements in the past that could come back to haunt his son's presidential ambitions . The Iowa event brought together two dozen big conservative names including Chris Christie, Rick Perry, Mike Huckabee, Sarah Palin and Donald Trump (pictured) 'Socialism requires that government becomes your god,' Pastor Rafael Cruz said in 2013 at a family summit. 'That’s why they have to destroy the concept of God. They have to destroy all loyalties except loyalty to the government. That’s what’s behind homosexual marriage.' In 2012 he told a tea party meeting in north Texas that President Barack Obama should be sent 'back to Kenya, back to Indonesia.' 'We have to unmask this man,' Cruz's father continued. 'This is a man that seeks to destroy all concept of God. And I will tell you what, this is classical Marxist philosophy. Karl Marx very clearly said Marxism requires that we destroy God because government must become God.' The senator's flavor of this rhetoric is less blunt, more constitutional. 'Our rights, they don't come from government,' he said Saturday. 'They come from God almighty.' That's his segue to 'abolish the IRS' and reduce tax filings to 'a postcard.' And to tense foreign affairs. 'You cannot fight and win a war on radical Islamic terrorism if you're unwilling to utter the words ""radical Islamic terrorism"",' he said. And those 9/11 hijackers? 'They weren't a bunch of ticked-off Presbyterians.'","At the Iowa Freedom Summit, he boomed a Reaganesque sermon complete with scripture references and an altar call – just send a text message!
Cruz had spent all week in Washington, he told a Des moines crowd, 'So it's great to be back in America'
He said the US should close the IRS and post all 110,000 employees on its southern border – an army of tax agents to scare illegal immigrants .

Cruz's father is a controversial preacher who advocated sending Barack Obama 'back to Kenya' and said gay marriage is about abolishing God from the public arena ."
"Pauline Cafferkey has made a full recovery after battling ebola for almost a month . A British nurse struck down by ebola said last night she had come so close to death fighting the killer virus that she had told herself: ‘That’s it.’ Pauline Cafferkey, 39, was speaking after making a full recovery and being discharged from the Royal Free Hospital in London. She spent almost a month in an isolation tent, and for nine days during that time she was in a critical condition. She caught ebola in Sierra Leone, and as the virus took hold, Ms Cafferkey began to wonder if she would survive. She said: ‘There was a point when I remember saying “That’s it, I’ve had enough.” I was frightened but ebola is so unpredictable. When I was told I had it I just said, “Well, I’ve got a battle on my hands”, which I did.’ Ms Cafferkey, from South Lanarkshire, was treated with experimental antiviral drug called ZMAb. She also received blood plasma from an ebola survivor containing antibodies which are thought to have helped her battle the virus. Dr Michael Jacobs, who led the medical team at the Royal Free, said they had ‘delved into the world of experimental treatments’ to save her. He said Mrs Cafferkey had now recovered completely and was ‘not infectious in any way’. The nurse added to the antivirals and antibodies with her own regime, saying: ‘I had lots of Irn-Bru to help me!’ She said: ‘I am just happy to be alive. I feel weak, but I’m looking forward to going home.’ She caught ebola in December while volunteering with Save The Children. She is the second Briton to have beaten the virus after catching it in Sierra Leone. Nurse William Pooley, 29, was flown back to the Royal Free for treatment in August. The 39-year-old contracted the disease while volunteering at a Save the Children treatment centre in Kerry Town, Sierra Leone . Ms Cafferkey spent more than three weeks in an isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London (above)","Pauline Cafferkey was discharged from the Royal Free Hospital in London .

"History was made yesterday as the top three teams in the Premier League crashed out of the FA Cup, capping one of the most remarkable days in the 144-year history of the competition. Third-tier Bradford City stormed back from two down to beat league leaders Chelsea 4-2 at Stamford Bridge. Reigning Premier League champions Manchester City lost 2-0 at home to the Championship's Middlesbrough, and third-placed Southampton lost 3-2 at home to struggling Crystal Palace. Bradford's Mark Yeates looks up to the skies as the League 1 side celebrate their victory over Chelsea . Chelsea's starting line-up cost around £98 million – Bradford's team of free signings and loanees, just £7,500 . Bradford City's players can scarcely believe their improbable victory over the Premier League leaders . Middlesbrough also enjoyed a famous victory - beating Premier League champions Manchester City 2-0 . Jubilant Middlesbrough fans celebrate their giant killing fourth round victory away at Manchester City . The greatest shock of the day came in west London where Bradford City - roared on by 6,000 travelling supporters - embarrassed the Premier League leaders. Prior to the match, Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said it would be 'disgrace' if his side made up of international stars failed to defeat the League 1 outfit. Chelsea's starting line-up cost around £98 million – Bradford's team of free signings and loan players, just £7,500. Their only player to cost a fee was James Hanson, a former supermarket shelf stacker. And with the home side leading 2-0 after 40 minutes, it looked like Mourinho's men would romp to victory. But a goal by Football League journeyman Jon Stead shortly before half-time brought Bradford to life and they netted three goals in the last 15 minutes to win 4-2 and send their fans in to delirium. They became the first third-tier team to score four against the Blues in 57 years. After the game, Mourinho said he was 'ashamed' and 'embarrassed' by his side's fourth-round exit, but went in to the away dressing room after the game to congratulate his opponents. 'It's a disgrace for a big team to lose to a small team from a lower league. Me and the players must feel ashamed', he said. For Bradford, the giant killing is the latest in a series of remarkable recent cup upsets. While in the fourth tier of English football, the Bantams defeated Arsenal and Aston Villa en route to the League Cup final in 2013. Manager Phil Parkinson told BBC Radio 5 live: 'The lads are absolutely bouncing in that dressing room and what they've done today will be remembered for a very long time - not just in Bradford but all around the country.'

The day was no less embarrassing for Manchester City. After squeezing through the last round against lower league opposition, they were underdone by Championship high-flyers Middlesbrough at the Etihad Stadium. Patrick Bamford, a loan signing from Chelsea, scored the first and the Spaniard Kike sealed the victory in stoppage time in front of their ecstatic army of travelling fans. An incredible round of shocks began on Friday night when League Two Cambridge United held Manchester United to a goalless draw at the derelict Abbey Stadium. It continued on Saturday lunchtime as Swansea City exited at the hands of Championship Blackburn Rovers.

"A 19th-century cannonball discovered in the chimney of a family home caused a commotion in Georgetown, Washington D.C. when the military had to be called in after fears it could still explode. Having lived in their house in the historic neighborhood of the nation's capital for 18 years, the Norregaard family decided that the time had come to have their chimney and fireplace cleaned out professionally. Until then they had only lit candles in the hearth rather than used logs. For 18 years the Norregaard family had only lit candles in their fireplace, but when they decided to have it professionally cleaned to burn wood the cleaning crew discovered a 19th-century cannonball in the chimney . To their surprise the cleaning crew discovered a cannonball dating from the Civil War-era. The cannonball became an object of fascination for the Norregaard family. The children showed their friends, and Mr Norregaard used it as a paperweight . Homeowner Rula Norregaard found the cleaning crew holding the cannonball and was thrilled. The family treated the heavy piece of lead as an object of fascination and it became a talking point, with the children showing it off to their friends and Rula's husband even keeping it on his desk as a paperweight. It was only at their Christmas party that a physicist friend pointed out that it could still be active and suggested that they call the authorities. On Wednesday after the family had returned from vacation, Norregaard did just that, dialing 311 instead of 911. The 311 operators thought the situation could be very dangerous and soon the police, fire department and bomb squad were at the Georgetown house. The bomb squad had never dealt with a cannonball before and so called in the military. Soldiers from the 55th Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Company responded to the unexploded ordnance, and they ordered an evacuation of the block on Wednesday afternoon. As the bomb squad had never dealt with a cannonball before, the military had to be called in. Their first command was to evacuate the block before they could remove the potentially dangerous explosive device . There was much commotion in the neighborhood and a @gtowncannonball twitter handle was generated. 'It was a Civil War cannon ball,' said Staff Sgt. Dewon Crumpton, the team leader who retrieved the cannon ball from the townhouse. An Iraq War veteran from Ocala, Florida, Crumpton and his team took the cannon ball to Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia. Analysis confirmed that the cannonball still had gunpowder inside it and was therefore still live. The army had no choice but to carry out a controlled detonation and destroy it. The Norregaard family were disappointed, having hoped that it might be deemed safe and returned to them to display in the house, which had once been a girls' school. The mystery remains as to how it got to be in the chimney in the first place. Crumpton said the cannon ball was not the most unusual unexploded ordnance call he had received. He previously rendered safe two artillery rounds that were found in a garage in Virginia. Having found that the Civil War-era cannonball was still live, the 55th EOD Company had no choice but to destroy it. EOD soldiers conducted more than 2,000 such operations around the nation in 2014 . The Fort Belvoir, Virginia-based 55th EOD Company is part of the 192nd EOD Battalion, 52nd EOD Group, 20th CBRNE Command (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, Explosives), the U.S. Defense Department's only formation that combats chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive threats around the world. Command Sgt. Maj. Harold E. Dunn IV, the senior enlisted leader of the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland-based 20th CBRNE Command, said Army EOD technicians regularly respond to unexploded ordnance calls. In 2014, EOD Soldiers conducted more than 2,000 explosive mitigation missions around the nation, both on and off military installations. A seasoned EOD leader from Fredericksburg, Virginia, Dunn said unexploded ordnance (UXO) can be found anywhere. 'You name it,' said Dunn. 'Mantles in homes, basements, scrap yards, trash cans, dumps, offices, garages and on desks.' 'If you find UXO, stay away from it and notify your local authorities,' said Dunn.","The Civil War-era cannonball was found in a chimney by a cleaning crew hired by the Norregaard family who had lived in the home for 18 years .

"Illegal immigration jumped to the front of Iowa conservatives' minds on Saturday when a group of protesters heckled two potential presidential candidates for disagreeing with President Barack Obama's recent moves on the subject. 'If you become president, will you deport our families?' the group of eight shouted over and over from the balcony, after former Texas Gov. Rick Perry spoke about how he had mobilized his state's National Guard troops to patrol America's southern border. One was heard shouting 'We are Americans!' Security at the Iowa Freedom Summit escorted them out with their signs, which read 'DEPORTABLE?' – but not before the near-capacity audience drowned them out by applauding and cheering nonstop for two minutes. Perry kept talking, but no one could hear him. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Protesters tried to shout over former Texas Gov. Rick Perry in Des Moines, Iowa on Saturday, yelling about immigration and deportations . SPITTING IN THE WIND: Perry kept his speech rolling whiel his audience cheered to drown out the heckers, so he was inaudible for 2 minutes straight . 'DON'T THEY KNOW I""M FROM NEW JERSEY?' Gov. Chris Christie heard from the last immigration protester, 32-year-old Marco Malagon, but mocked his group after his arrest . The signs also carried a smaller message: ' Do potential presidential candidates agree with Rep. Steve King?' King, the Saturday summit's organizer, represents Iowa's rural westernmost counties and stands out as right-wing in a blue-trending state. He's staunchly in favor of increasing deportations of people living in the U.S. illegally, and of increasing security on America's southern border. Last week he castigated first lady Michelle Obama for inviting a 'deportable' student to watch the State of the Union address from her balcony box in the House of Representatives chamber. That comment inspired the signs. The protesters, from a group called DRM Action, advocate for so-called 'DREAMers,' illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as chidren. Obama announced in 2012 that he would protect them from deportation while he's president, but Congress hasn't passed a law to make the move permanent. Des Moines Police told Daily Mail Online that Cesar Vargas and Marco Malagon, a 32-year-old Dallas man, were arrested. Vargas is the group's co-chair. A crush of photographers both inside and outside captured the protests and the police action in digital images. Marco Malagon, a 32-year-old immigration protester, heckled CHris Christie and was arrested . The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program stands, however, and immigration activists fear that a Republican-run Congress could throw up roadblocks forbidding the White House from implementing it. The president expanded his controversial move in December, enlarging his unilateral action to include 5 million additional illegal immigrants, granting them residency cards and work permits. One activist in the balcony on Saturday, later identified as Malagon, managed to stay behind and elude security. Ten minutes later when New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie took the stage, he rose and picked up where his friends had left off. 'Governor Christie? If you become president will you stand with Steve King and deport our families?' he shouted. Over a quiet groan from the audience, Christie waited for security officers to eject the young man. Then he quipped: 'Don't they know I'm from New Jersey?' The Garden State, unlike Perry's Texas, is far away from the contentious U.S-Mexico border. The DRM Action coalition made a small wave in Des Moines along with Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz . OUTFOXED: Rep. Steve King was the protesters' original target but he avoided them by leaving immigration issues out of his own speech . DRM Action filled its Twitter feed on Saturday with promises to 'confront' King, the Iowa congressman. But King left immigration out of his stump speech on Saturday, and avoided it while introducing other speakers. King embraced other tea party themes: 'the degredation of American exceptionalism,' Obama's executive 'overreach,' and abolishing the IRS. Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida congresswoman in a shrinking House minority, held a small event across the street from the Hoyt Sherman Place auditorium in which she claimed potential presidential candidates on the right had come to 'give extremism a stage' and 'kiss Steve King's ring.' The DNC put out an online video on Saturday mocking King and the Freedom Summit's speakers. A Des Moines Police officer told Daily Mail Online that the protest 'was just a handful of people. No trouble.' 'I've seen more energy from little-league mothers.'","'If you become president, will you deport out families?' a group of immigration activists shouted from the balcony of a Des Moines auditorium .

"A Muslim woman has filed a federal lawsuit against the city of Dearborn Heights, Michigan, its police department and police chief, after being forced to remove her hijab following her arrest. Malak Kazan, 27, claims that officers at Dearborn Heights Police Department violated her First Amendment right to religious freedom by making her remove her head scarf when booking her. A further part of the law suit covers the fact that there were no female police officers present at the time of her booking, adding to her humiliation. Malak Kazan, 27, claims that officers at Dearborn Heights Police Department violated her First Amendment right to religious freedom by making her remove her head scarf when booking her for traffic violation . She expressed concern but was told there were no female police officers available. A supervisor then told her that if she did not remove her hijab she could be detained further. Her Islamic faith requires her to cover her hair and neck in the presence of men who are not part of her immediate family. 'Your religious freedoms are not stripped at the jailhouse door. It's part of the cannons of their faith to wear a head scarf. For her to have it removed in front of a non-relative male, would be a non-pleasant experience for her,' said Kazan's attorney, Amir Makled. Kazan's attorney, Amir Makled (pictured left), told Fox 2: 'Your religious freedoms are not stripped at the jailhouse door'. Kazan (pictured right) in a previous booking shot for Dearborn Heights PD . The lawsuit described her experience as a 'deeply humiliating, violating, and defiling experience'. Kazan was arrested for a warrant following a traffic stop in July 2014 and was arrested having let her driver's license expire. There were two warrants for her arrest because she never appeared in court. She was booked and detained in November 2014. Dearborn Heights PD stands by its procedures. 'Articles such as hats, caps, hijabs, can contain concealable items that could pose a threat or chance of injury to the cops or to themselves,' said Dearborn Heights Police Chief Lee Garvin. 'Our procedure is to have them take the hijab off in the presence of a female,' Garvin added. 'We don't always have enough female officers present in the station. Our Number one concern is security of our officers and the prisoners.' 'Articles such as hats, caps, hijabs, can contain concealable items that could pose a threat or chance of injury to the cops or to themselves,' said Dearborn Heights Police Chief Lee Garvin . Makled counters that there was no such threat from Kazan's hijab and sees the policy as discriminatory. 'At this point she is only doing a booking photograph. They can't get in here and say officer safety. It's a booking photo it's used for identity purposes only.' Professor Larry Dubin from the University of Detroit Law School thinks Kazan has a good religious discrimination law suit . Kazan filed the federal lawsuit to get the department to modify its current policy and allow Muslim women to wear a head scarf during booking procedures to avoid her humiliation. The word hijab comes from the Arabic word 'hajaba', which means to conceal or hide from view. Makled is also seeking compensatory and punitive damages for Kazan. The lawsuit also claims Kazan's Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights were also violated – the right to be secure from unreasonable searches by the government, and the right to equal protection of the laws. Professor Larry Dubin from the University of Detroit Law School told myFoxDetroit.com that he thinks Kazan has a good religious discrimination lawsuit. 'The First Amendment guarantees religious freedom,' Dubin said. 'She is entitled to wear the hijab and not have it taken off unless there is a more state compelling interest that needs to be satisfied. 'And that's what a federal judge is going to have to decide.'","Malak Kazan, 27, claims officers at Dearborn Heights Police Department violated her First Amendment right to religious freedom .

"A teenager hacked to death in a machete attack was trying to protect a group of young girls from a 'lunatic' when he was killed, according to his family. Zacary Evans, 19, was one of three friends attacked with a machete as he tried to act as a peacemaker outside the Pike and Musket pub in Tuffley, Gloucester, in the early hours of Saturday. Detectives are questioning a 44-year-old Gloucester man on suspicion of murder and officers are still searching for the weapon – thought to be a machete at least two feet in length. A spokesman for Mr Evans's family told the Sunday Telegraph: 'It's something that should never have happened, he stepped in to help someone else.

Prayers were said for the family and friends of the murdered teenager earlier today at St George's Church in Tuffley. Mr Evans's childhood friend Harry Lauder, 19, laid flowers on the pavement outside the pub with a message saying 'Sleep well young man, you and your memories will never be forgotten. Hope to see you again one day.' Mr Lauder, who works in a warehouse, said he was in shock. 'Zac just wasn't the type of lad to get into situations like this,' he said. 'He didn't often go out at night even.

Sophie Jadie wrote on Twitter: 'RIP Zac Evans, such a kind, caring and good friend, you will never be forgotten, I'll see you there one day, shine bright angel.' Detective Chief Inspector Steve Porter said: 'We are keen to trace what we believe to be the weapon in this attack, which is a large machete-type weapon with a large blade at least 24 inches long. 'If anybody knows the location of that weapon, or where it could be discarded we would ask them to come forward. 'We believe we have identified the victim and have spoken to the family, who are obviously distraught at this incident and their loss.' The officer added: 'We'd appeal to anybody with any information in relation to what occurred this morning, or anybody with knowledge of why this incident occurred, and particularly anybody who knows the whereabouts of the weapon, to please contact us as soon as possible.' Anyone with information is urged to call Gloucestershire Police on 101. The family of Mr Evans have said he may have been trying to defend a group of girls during the attack .

"Dignified and solemn, and a display of all the ceremony that Britain could muster, Sir Winston Churchill’s State funeral 50 years ago was the country’s epic farewell to its revered wartime leader. But Buckingham Palace courtiers were initially opposed to giving such an honour to a mere ‘commoner’, previously unpublished official papers reveal. Their concerns have come to light as Britain prepares to mark the 50th anniversary of the funeral, which took place on January 30, 1965. Scroll down for video . Anniversary: Sir Winston Churchill, left, died 50 years ago. Right, guardsmen carry the Prime Minister's coffin . Official documents in the Parliamentary Archive in the House of Commons show that Royal representatives first raised their concerns in 1959 – just as civil servants were beginning to plan the event. A record of a ‘Garter Meeting’ which took place on June 23 that year states: ‘It was clear that Garter and the Palace representatives did not appreciate the vast scale on which this occasion is likely to develop – at any rate as regards the lying in state. In this they were considerably influenced by the theory that the funeral of a commoner must in all respects be on a smaller scale than that of a Royal person.’ The same document also refers to a proposal to include French and American troops in the event alongside representatives of the police, civil defence and Commonwealth forces. It states: ‘Opinion seemed to be against this, partly on the grounds that the procession must not be larger than that of a reigning Monarch and partly because it would be difficult to know where to stop.’ At one point it was even suggested that Prince Philip should act as one of the pallbearers. News of the Palace’s concerns will surprise many because the Queen was known to have been close to Sir Winston, who was Prime Minister when she came to the throne in 1952. Sombre: Crowds gathered in Trafalgar Square on 30 January 1965 to pray for the great wartime leader . Ceremony: Attended by dignitaries from 112 countries – a record – it was the largest State funeral to date . Mourning: The Duke of Edinburgh and Queen Elizabeth led other members of the Royal Family in St Paul's . Historian Andrew Roberts, the author of the book Eminent Churchillians, said it was quite possible that the Queen herself had not been aware of the opposition. He said: ‘It is interesting that Buckingham Palace didn’t want Churchill’s funeral to overshadow Royal funerals. On one level you can see their point a bit. But this isn’t necessarily the Queen herself – it sounds like courtiers, who are often more conservative than the Monarch. ‘The very fact that the Queen went to the funeral of a commoner was a complete break with precedent.’ The files show that preparations for Churchill’s funeral were revised seven times in the years leading up to his death and that the last revision occurred just a month before he died on January 24, 1965. Tributes: Lord Charles Spencer-Churchill, Lady Blanford and the Marquis of Blanford at Churchill's grave . Dignified: Crowds gathered as the coffin is carried up the steps of St Paul's Cathedral in London . Respects: Queues outside St Martin's Parish Church in Blandon, Oxfordshire, where Churchill was buried . Officials spent a great deal of time planning what to do in the event of Sir Winston dying abroad. The files show that the Royal Navy was charged with bringing Churchill’s body home in the event of him dying in France, Belgium or Holland. In any other country, the Royal Air Force would have been responsible for repatriation. In the event, he died in his London home. Attended by dignitaries from 112 countries – a record – it was the largest State funeral to date. The former Prime Minister’s body lay in state for three days in Westminster Hall and more than 300,000 people waited to pay their respects. Silent crowds lined the street as the cortege made its way from Westminster to St Paul’s Cathedral and dockers bowed their cranes as the coffin was carried down the River Thames. Last night, Buckingham Palace declined to comment.","Death of Sir Winston Churchill was marked with a dignified State funeral .

"George Jung, the heavyweight cocaine smuggler who inspired the Johnny Depp film 'Blow', has been released from prison. The 71-year-old walked free today following a nearly 20-year stint at FCI Fort Dix in New Jersey, according to TMZ. He will live in a West Coast half-way house as he adjusts to life on the outside. The ex-drugs boss, originally due for release in November this year, was responsible for more than 85 percent of the cocaine smuggled into America in the 1970s and 1980s.

'Basically I was no different than a rock star or a movie star. I was a coke star.' Nicknamed 'Boston George' after the Massachusetts city in which he was born, Jung first entered the drug underworld in the 1960s selling marijuana. He was sent to prison in 1974 for smuggling 660 pounds of marijuana, and while inside met Carlos Ledher who facilitated his entry into cocaine trafficking. Lehder introduced Jung to the Medellín Cartel, and Jung taught Lehder how to smuggle. The two earned millions of dollars together.

"She spent most of the winter so far in Massachusetts, lingering around the waters of Cape Cod. But on Saturday, Katharine  - a 2,300 pound great white shark that is being tracked by research team Ocearch - reared her head just north of Jacksonville, and appears to be heading south searching for warmer climes. Fortunately for Floridians, Katharine's whereabouts can be checked online. Scroll down for video . She's back: Katharine the great white shark has returned to the waters off Florida less than a month after being clocked leaving  Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where she has been all season . Here she comes: Katharine, who sends a radio signal every time she surfaces after being implanted with a transmitter, pinged off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida, on Saturday afternoon . Due south: On Friday, Katharine pinged near Fernandina Beach, right at the Georgia-Florida border . Katharine, who is 14 feet long, sends a signal every time she surfaces as part of a pioneering programme to show shark movements live online. Katharine is one of a group of great whites that  Ocearch have been following. The sharks are tagged with a transmitter and the research groups use radios to follow them. One of the others, Mary Lee, who at 3,456 pounds is much larger than Katharine, likes to stay in far-out Atlantic, keeping off Georgia and the Carolinas, according to WJCL News. But Katharine likes to travel up and down the east coast throughout the year, often passing through Mary Lee's territory. Katharine was first tagged on August 20, 2013. Transmitter: Katharine has wondered the east coast since she was tagged on August 20, 2013 . Signal: The transmitter allows research groups like Ocearch to track Katharine when she surfaces . In the first 10 months, she traveled over 5,000 miles. The tags can last up to five years. Having spent most of the season in Cape Cod, many thought Katharine might stay there. She has even gone as far north as the southern coast of the panhandle. However as the Massachusetts waters got holder she made a sharp journey south, according to The Inquisitr. Within  days Katharine was in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, and came so close to shore she startled locals. Traveler: In the first 10 months of her tracking, she traveled over 5,000 miles . Then on Thursday, Katharine and Mary Lee were quite close to each other, before Katharine turned up in north Florida Saturday. It will be interesting to see whether Katharine revisits the route she took last year, when she traveled all the way down to the Gulf of Mexico. The largest ever recorded great white was 21 feet long. Revisiting?: Last year he shark was first spotted near Miami, passing close to Key west before going to the Gulf . Route: In June last year, Katharine was clocked off the coast of Florida, heading towards Texas .","Katharine, a 14-foot Great White, sends a signal every time she surfaces .

"A shocking series of images that show the moment a hot air balloon collided with power lines and burst into flames, killing the 11 people on board, have been released to the public. Considered one of New Zealand's worst air disasters, the Carterton balloon tragedy occurred almost three years ago, however photographs of the disaster have only just been made available in the name of 'public interest' following a lengthy court battle with the photographer, TVNZ reports. The graphic images, only a few of the 600 taken of the incident by Geoff Walker, document the precise moment the balloon struck a set of power lines and instantly burst into flames. Scroll down for video . The images of the Carterton balloon tragedy, taken by local photographer Geoff Walker, were used as evidence in the coroners inquest . Drifting away from the point of contact, black smoke is shown billowing from the basket which appears to be completely engulfed in flames after hitting the power lines . The shrivelled and burnt balloon is swallowed by the surrounding plumes as it plummets to the ground, while the basket is unrecognisable behind the inferno . Drifting away from the point of contact, black smoke is shown billowing from the basket which appears to be completely engulfed in flames in the second image. In the final and most disturbing photo, a shrivelled and burnt balloon is swallowed by the surrounding plumes as it plummets to the ground, while the basket is unrecognisable behind the inferno. Initially all of the images, which were submitted as evidence for the public inquest into the disaster, had been banned from public release due to their sensitive nature. However after requests from local media and the families of the victims, the coroner in charge of the case, Peter Ryan, authorised the public release of four. Eleven people died in the tragedy: (Pictured, left to right) Alexis Still, Denise Dellabarca, Ann Dean, Diana Cox . More victims: Stephen Hopkirk, Belinda Harter, Howard Cox, Johannes Jordaan also died in the fatal hot air balloon crash in 2012 . Desmond and Ann Dean, aged 70 and 65 years respectively, were two more of the victims . Mr Walker challenged the decision, claiming copyright and arguing that their release 'didn't do anyone any good', however this was dismissed by Justice Allan Mackenzie, who ruled that the evidence presented at a public inquest should be accessible, according to Stuff.co.nz. The father of Alexis Still, who was one of the victims in the crash, said he supported the publication of the images as he believed they could prevent further tragedies. 'You can read about the accident, but when you see it in action, it brings it home,' he told Stuff.co.nz. The inquiry heard that pilot Lance Hopping, who also died during the accident, was a long-term pot smoker. A post-mortem found traces of the drug in the 53-year-old's system . The coroner is yet to release his findings on the disaster, however in 2014 the hearing heard that the balloon's pilot, Lance Hopping, was a regular cannabis user who hid his addiction from authorities, according to testimonies from his partner and an associate. A post-mortem found traces of the drug in the 53-year-old's system, which could possibly have affected his judgment while flying the vessel. Coroner Ryan stated that the inquest's purpose was to determine the facts of the event and establish recommendations that will help prevent similar incidents in the future. The crash area, near the town of Carterton, was only a short distance north of New Zealand's capital . Local media and the families of the victims argued for the graphic pictures to be made public to prevent further tragedies . 'You can read about the accident, but when you see it in action, it brings it home,' the father of one of the victims said . The head of the investigation, Detective Inspector Sean Hansen, testified that the balloon hit 33kV lines before the electrical arc sparked a fire. This was followed by the LPG tank rupturing, the gas adding to the fire. The victims of the tragedy include Lance Hopping, Desmond and Ann Dean, Alexis Still and Chrisjan Jordaan were Valerie Bennett, Ms Bennett's cousin Denise Dellabarca, husband and wife Howard and Diana Cox, Stephen Hopkirk and Belinda Harter.","Eleven people were killed in the disaster in Carterton, New Zealand in 2012 .

"Police in the Texas city of Rosenberg are hunting an armed robber who held up a family inside a gated community at gunpoint. However the sketch that investigators released of the armed gunman shows he was wearing a grey Los Angeles Dodges shirt and not much else. The aggravated robbery occurred last Saturday inside the parking lot of the Place Apartments on Vista Drive about 6.30pm. The victim, Olivia Bell, said she was getting out her car with her boyfriend and two-year-old daughter when the man approached them in a ski mask. Wanted: Police in Rosenberg, Texas, have released this sketch of a  masked gunman who robbed a mom and her young daughter last weekend. The white male suspect was wearing a Los Angeles Dodgers jersey . Ms Bell said her first instinct was to slam the door of the car to protect her daughter, who was still on the backseat. 'I just thought please Lord, don't let him hurt my baby, not my baby,' she told KHOU. Th robber demanded everything the couple had, and made off with their phones, iPad, wallets and diaper bag. 'I guess he was hoping there was something so great in the diapers,' Bell said. It was at that point the bandit realized Ms Bell had a child and said to her: 'I'm sorry, but I have to pay my bills.' Police believed the man is linked to at least two other robberies in the area. They warned Rosenberg residents to be careful at night, particularly parents, who seem to be the man's prey. The suspect is described as a white male, of about 5 feet 10 to 6 feet tall. Ms Bell and her boyfriend worked on the sketch for police. No injuries have been involved in the robberies. Anyone with information can contact Detective R. Leonhardt - anonymously or not - at 832-595-3700 or contact Crime Stoppers at 281-342-TIPS (8477).","Robbery occurred in Rosenberg, Texas, last Saturday about 6.30pm .

"The wife of Google tycoon Sergey Brin had their unborn daughter DNA tested to discover the girl’s risk of developing breast cancer, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s later in life. Anne Wojcicki, founder of DNA screening service 23andMe, also had the couple’s son gene-tested in the first few months of his life to obtain a ‘road map’ of future risks to his health, and advocates British parents using her company to do the same for their own children. As a result of the tests, Ms Wojcicki discovered that her son is lactose-intolerant. She believes parents should know the genetic flaws of their offspring so they can better care for them, arguing: ‘Forewarned is forearmed.’ She also predicts that within a decade, all babies born in the UK and US will have a DNA test at birth. Scroll down for video . Anne Wojcicki (right), the wife of Google tycoon Sergey Brin (left), had their unborn daughter DNA tested to discover the girl’s risk of developing diseases in later life . But watchdogs have fiercely criticised such ‘fishing expeditions’. ‘You are imposing this information on the child at a time when they have no say about whether they would ever want it,’ says Oxford University genetics professor Dagan Wells. ‘And once you have the test done, you’ve got it. You can’t undo it – the information is out there.’ Ms Wojcicki revealed that with her daughter, now three, she sent her amniotic fluid – the liquid that protects the unborn baby inside the womb – to be checked. Amniotic fluid tests are often carried out on mothers over 35 to determine the risk of their unborn child having Down’s syndrome. Mr Brin's son was also DNA tested in the early stages of his life . ‘I couldn’t wait,’ Ms Wojcicki says. ‘If you have a road map, if you know what certain risks are [as a parent], you can alter behaviour accordingly.’ She declined to say if either of her children carry genes that put them at high risk of any particular hereditary disease. For £125, 23andMe will analyse DNA in saliva samples for genes linked to dozens of inherited conditions, including cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anaemia, breast cancer, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Among the genes it looks for are BRCA1 and BRCA2, which greatly increase the chance of breast and ovarian cancer. In 2013, actress Angelina Jolie had a double mastectomy after finding out she had the BRCA1 gene. Yet Dr Helen Wallace, of think-tank GeneWatch UK, warns: ‘The link between genes and many diseases are poorly understood. These tests should not be on the market at all, let alone offered for use on children.’ Ms Wojcicki flew to Britain last month to launch the testing service here. Giving children the DNA test is entirely legal in the UK – but official guidelines advise against it unless there is a pressing medical reason. In 2013, 23andMe was barred from giving health advice to American customers after the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), cited concerns over the accuracy of the health interpretations. The test searches for genes that can cause serious diseases in later life, including the BRCA1 gene which can cause breast cancer. Angelina Jolie had a double mastectomy after discovering she had the gene . While European laws have deemed testing kits safe, the EU has yet to legislate on the offering of such services. ‘They [23andMe] have pressed ahead in Europe despite being banned in America,’ says Dr Wallace. ‘In effect, they are exploiting a loophole.’ Despite the FDA action, the company has struck a deal with drugs giant Pfizer to share its database of genetic information to be used for research. Customers can consent for the results of their children’s genetic testing to be included in the research. Dr Wallace argues: ‘A baby wouldn’t be able to consent to this. You don’t know how that information is going to affect them when they are older, so it’s a huge step to take.’ But Ms Wojcicki stresses: ‘If we are not doing a great job, then you can download your data and delete your account.’","Wife of Google tycoon Sergey Brin had her unborn daughter DNA tested .

"A 24-year-old Muslim convert has admitted taking her infant son to live among Islamic State terrorists in the Syrian city of Raqqa because she believes he will lead a 'better life' under their brutal regime. Asiya Ummi Abdullah denied that children are unhappy living under the oppressive rule of ISIS' religious fanatics and explained that she felt her three-year-old son's spiritual well-being was better served in the group's de facto capital, where public crucifixions and beheadings are commonplace. Ummi Abduallah - who had lived in Turkey since her teens but was born in Kyrgyzstan - said moving to the militant stronghold in Syria was in part to shield the young boy from the sex, crime, drugs and alcohol she sees as rampant in her home town Istanbul. 'Who says children here are unhappy?... He will know God and live under his rules,' she said. Scroll down for video . Missing: Sahin Aktan, 44, shows photos of his ex-wife Asiya Ummi Abdullah during an interview at his lawyer's office in Istanbul, Turkey. The 24-year-old Muslim convert took their child to territory controlled by ISIS . Radicals: ISIS supporters slogans as they carry the group's flags in front of the provincial government headquarters in Mosul, Iraq. A growing number of people are moving to the region to live under Shariah law . Ummi Abdullah's journey to radical Islam was born of loneliness and resentment. Born Svetlana Hasanova, she converted to Islam after marrying Aktan six years ago. The pair met in Turkey when Hasanova, still a teenager, came to Istanbul from with her mother to buy textiles. Ummi Abdullah had travelled from former Soviet republic Kyrgyzstan, where 80 per cent of the population are Muslim and Russian Orthodoxy is the minority religion. Her story, told to The Associated Press in a series of Facebook messages, illustrates how the vast swaths of territory under the control of ISIS in Syria and Iraq have become home to thousands of devout Muslim families, despite the extreme violence so often found there. Many of these highly religious families are Turkish and have made their way to ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa with young children in tow in order to live among murderers and terrorists. 'The children of that country see all this and become either murderers or delinquents or homosexuals or thieves,' Ummi Abduallah wrote, attempting to justify moving her young son into ISIS' brutal realm. ISIS, the self-styled caliphate straddling Iraq and Syria, appears eager to attract families. One recent promotional video shows a montage of Muslim fighters from around the world cuddling their children in Raqqa against the backdrop of an amusement park where children run and play. Mr Aktan holds up a picture of the son he's not seen since July, when his ex-wife took him over the border to ISIS-controlled Raqqa where she now lives . A man, identified in the footage as an American named Abu Abdurahman al-Trinidadi, holds an infant who has a toy machine gun strapped to his back. 'Look at all the little children,' al-Trinidadi says. 'They're having fun.' It may promote itself as a family-friendly place, but ISIS' bloody campaign for control of Syria and Iraq has uprooted hundreds of thousands of people in a wave of destruction involving brutal punishments and  acts of cultural vandalism. None of that matters to Ummi Abdullah. 'The blood and goods of infidels are halal,' she said - meaning she believes that Islam sanctions the killing of non-Muslims. Ummi Abdullah's story has already made waves in Turkey, where her disappearance became front-page news after her ex-husband - a 44-year-old car salesman named Sahin Aktan - went to the press in an effort to find their child. Many others in Turkey have carted away family to ISIS territory under far less public scrutiny and in much greater numbers. In one incident earlier this month, more than 50 families from various parts of Turkey slipped across the border to live under ISIS, according to opposition legislator Atilla Kart. Kart's figure appears high, but his account is backed by a villager from Cumra, in central Turkey, who told AP that his son and his daughter-in-law are among the massive group. The villager spoke on condition of anonymity, saying he is terrified of reprisals. The movement of foreign fighters to the Islamic State group - largely consisting of alienated, angry or simply war-hungry young Muslims - has been covered extensively. The arrival of entire families, many but not all of them Turkish, has received less attention. 'It's about fundamentalism,' said Han, a professor of international relations at Istanbul's Kadir Has University. The Islamic State group's uncompromising interpretation of Islam promises parents the opportunity to raise their children free from any secular influence. 'It's a confined and trustable environment for living out your religion,' Han said. 'It kind of becomes a false heaven.' 'Before we were married': Aktan shows a picture of him and his wife in happier times, before the birth of their son and before her increasing interest in radical Islam . Aktan, speaking from his lawyer's office in Istanbul, said the relationship worked at first. 'Before we were married we were swimming in the sea, in the pool, and in the evening we would sit down and eat fish and drink wine. That's how it was,' he said, holding a photograph of the two of them, both looking radiant in a well-manicured garden. 'But after the kid was born, little by little she started interpreting Islam in her own way.' Aktan said his wife became increasingly devout, covering her hair and praying frequently, often needling him to join in. He refused. 'Thank God, I'm a Muslim,' he said. 'But I'm not the kind of person who can pray five times a day.' Asked why she became engrossed in religion, Aktan acknowledged that his wife was lonely. But in Facebook messages to the AP, many typed out on a smartphone, Ummi Abdullah accused her husband of treating her 'like a slave.' She alleged that Aktan pressured her to abort their child and said she felt isolated in Istanbul. 'I had no friends,' she said. 'I was constantly belittled by him and his family. I was nobody in their eyes.' These photos are all Aktan has left of his son and ex-wife after she took the boy away to ISIS-controled territory . Aktan acknowledged initially asking his wife to terminate her pregnancy, saying it was too early in the marriage to have children. But when she insisted on carrying the pregnancy to term, Aktan said he accepted her decision and loved the boy. Meanwhile Aktan's wife was finding the companionship she yearned for online, chatting with jihadists and filling her Facebook page with religious exhortations and attacks on gays. In June, she and Aktan divorced. The next month, a day before her ex-husband was due to pick up their son for vacation, she left with the boy for Gaziantep, a Turkish town near the Syrian border. Aktan, who had been eavesdropping on her social media activity, alerted the authorities, but the pair still managed to slip across the border . It isn't clear how many families have followed Ummi Abdullah's path, although anecdotal evidence suggests a powerful flow from Turkey into Syria. In Dilovasi, a industrial town of 42,000  halfway between Istanbul and the port city of Izmit, at least four people - including a pair of brothers - recently left for Syria, three local officials said. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to talk to the media, said that dozens of people from surrounding towns were believed to have left as well. Aktan says he is in touch with other families in similar circumstances. He cited one case in the Turkish capital, Ankara, where 15 members of the same extended family had left for Syria 'as if they're going on vacation.' Even with U.S. bombs now falling on Raqqa, Ummi Abdullah says she has no second thoughts. 'I only fear God,' she wrote. For Aktan, who says he hasn't seen his son since his ex-wife took the boy, her decision is a selfish form of fanaticism. 'If you want to die, you can do so,' he said. 'But you don't have the right to bring the kid with you... No one can give you this right.' Ummi Abdullah's Facebook account has now disappeared. Her messages to the AP were also removed, replaced with a message from Facebook saying they were 'identified as abusive or marked as spam.' Facebook did not immediately return a message seeking comment.","Asiya Ummi Abdullah, 24, admitted taking son to live among ISIS terrorists .

"President Barack Obama's intelligence briefings have provided him with specific information since before he won re-election in 2012 about the growing threat of the terror group now known alternatively as ISIS and ISIL, an administration insider told MailOnline on Monday. 'Unless someone very senior has been shredding the president's daily briefings and telling him that the dog ate them, highly accurate predictions about ISIL have been showing up in the Oval Office since before the 2012 election,' said a national security staffer in the Obama administration who is familiar with the content of intelligence briefings. The staffer declined to share anything specific about the content of those briefings, citing his need to maintain a security clearance. But 'it's true,' he said, 'that the [intelligence] community was sending pretty specific intel up to us.' 'We were seeing specific threat assessments and many of them have panned out exactly as we were told they would.' Too little, too late? American-led coalition airstrikes against  targets near Aleppo, Syriaare welcome relief but don't change tough questions about when the White House knew ISIS had become a genocidal terror army . While ISIS claims it is plotting attacks on US and European targets, President Barack Obama says his intelligence chiefs failed to tell him how dire the threat was all along . Obama campaigned in 2012 while US intelligence services provided him with specific information about the moves and threats of militants who would later declare themselves a state as ISIS . The aide said he is familiar with some of the material regarding the Middle East that reaches Obama's desk. In a '60 Minutes' interview that aired Sunday, the president singled out James Clapper, his director of national intelligence, for blame in failing to understand the significance of the threat posed by the terror army that calls itself the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham. 'Our head of the intelligence community, Jim Clapper,' Obama said, 'has acknowledged that, I think, they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria.' That finger-pointing, MailOnline's source said, is not sitting well in the White House. 'It's starting to affect morale around here,' he said. 'Any time you're hired by a boss to advise him about what to do in a high-stakes area, and he ignores you for a long time, it's going to gnaw at you.' And choosing a fall guy, he said, has a smell of desperation about it since the president was warned long ago what could happen if ISIS, formerly known in the West as Al-Qaeda In Iraq, were left alone to fester following a U.S. military withdrawal. The last American boots on the ground were airlifted from Iraq in December 2011. In the months that followed, he explained, U.S. intelligence services compiled detailed information about what the groups he called 'bad guys' were doing to take advantage of the sudden power vacuum. And those briefings were specific about both the breadth of ISIS's aims and their ability to run roughshod over large swaths of two countries. There's 'no way' the president should blame the alphabet-soup of intelligence agencies for what resulted, the aide said. 'He had enough to go on ... He knew what was at stake. He knew where all the moving pieces were.' 'By February [2014] we had generals basically reading out their memos to Congress,' he added, referring to testimony from Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Flynn predicted ISIS 'probably will attempt to take territory in Iraq and Syria to exhibit its strength in 2014.' The Islamist terror group had already seized Fallujah and Ramadi, he said, had the 'ability to concurrently maintain multiple safe havens in Syria.' By the time Flynn spoke on Capitol Hill, Congress had already heard the story at least once before. Assistant Secretary of State Brett McGurk told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee in November 2013 that ISIS had been militarily active all year because of 'a permissive operating environment due to inherent weaknesses of Iraqi security forces, poor operational tactics, and popular grievances, which remain unaddressed.' 'It has also benefited from a sanctuary across the porous border in Syria, control of lucrative facilities there, such as oil wells, and regular movement of weapons and fighters between Syria and Iraq,' McGurk said. Is an air campaign enough? Obama is sending planes like these Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles over targets in Northern Iraq and Syria, but his enthusiasm for defeating the loathed Islamist radicals is late in coming if he has been briefed about them for more than two years . Under the bus: Obama told the '60 Minutes' program on Sunday that 'our head of the intelligence community, Jim Clapper, has acknowledged that, I think, they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria' Asked Monday whether the president heard that early warning and found it credible, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told an ABC News reporter that 'nobody could predict ... the (lack of) willingness of the Iraqi security forces to stand up and fight for their own country.' But MailOnline's source said that even McGurk's warning bells were old news in the White House. The president, he said, was hearing information about ISIS 'long before that. It goes back to the autumn of 2012.' Al-Qaeda in Iraq, he said, had already begun to metamorphose into ISIS before Obama ran for president the first time. In 2006 the group's Mujahideen Shura Council declared an Islamic 'state' in western and central Iraq, a development U.S. military intelligence was aware of since they were stationed 'in country.' By the late autumn of that year the nascent self-proclaimed Sunni country was organized and holding open-air military parades. President Obama ordered America's military to pack up and return home at the end of 2011. By that time, the would-be nation ISIS's goals had exploded to encompass controlling land in Syria. And its tactical toolbox had grown to include the kind of genocidal preferences that ISIS has showed in 2013 and 2014. While the U.S. officially left no residual military force in Iraq, the aide told MailOnline, small contingents of Special Operators and intelligence assets did remain behind. And the information they provided became part of the president's briefings in the months that followed – right in the midst of presidential campaign season. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shots across the bow: The president is seeing significant pushback now from members of the intel and national security communities who resent the White House ignoring their warning for years . Still, Obama repeatedly claimed in his campaign speeches that his administration had left Middle Eastern terror groups hamstrung and hurting. 'Four years ago, I promised to end the war in Iraq – and we did,' he said during a Sept. 13, 2012 speech in Colorado. 'I said we’d wind down the war in Afghanistan – and we are.' 'And while a new tower rises above the New York skyline, al-Qaeda is on the path to defeat and Osama bin Laden is dead.' Those words came two days after a terror attack that left a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans dead in Benghazi, Libya. The administration later claimed he was referring to 'al-Qaeda core,' the Pakistan-based mother ship once helped by Osama bin Laden. But ISIS's roots as an al-Qaeda faction now make Obama's pronouncements look questionable. Since the president's CBS interview aired Sunday night, a few intrepid whistle-blowers have poked their heads above Washington's parapets to disagree with his claim that his intelligence advisers failed to pinpoint the growing ISIS threat. One former senior Pentagon aide told The Daily Beast that 'either the president doesn't read the intelligence he’s getting or he’s bulls***ting.' Like that former official, MailOnline's source requested anonymity. He echoed the Pentagon veteran's concerns about how the president digests the information that Clapper and others distill for him on a daily basis. 'It's pretty well-known that the president hasn’t taken in-person intelligence briefings with any regularity since the early days of 2009,' the aide said. 'He gets them in writing.' 'And it's well-understood why. No one sits and watches him read them, and no one can come back later and tell Congress in a closed session that ""I told the president this specific thing was likely to happen"".' ISIS, which has its roots in Al-Qaeda In Iraq, is a 31,000-strong terror army that has seized massive land areas in Iraq and Syria and now occupies about one-third of both . House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican, said late Monday in a statement that U.S. intelligence agencies have 'specifically warned' for 'over a year' that ISIS 'was taking advantage of the situation in Syria to recruit members and provoke violence that could spill into Iraq and the rest of the region.' In 2013, he said, his committee 'formally pressed the administration for action to address the terrorist threat present in Syria.' 'We all knew that former Iraqi Prime Minster Maliki had mismanaged his military and gutted the ISF (Iraqi Security Forces) of its top commanders. Indeed, over a year ago, our Arab League partners sought U.S. support and leadership for a coordinated effort to address the extremist threat in eastern Syria.' 'This was not an Intelligence Community failure,' Rogers said, 'but a failure by policy makers to confront the threat.' Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain told a CNN audience on Monday that he was 'puzzled by the president, some of his statements. ... We predicted what would happen if we didn’t leave (a) residual force' in Iraq. 'The intelligence people are pushing back hard,' McCain observed. 'We predicted this and watched it, it was like watching a train wreck, and warning every step of the way that this was happening.'","A national security staffer in the Obama administration said the president has been seeing 'highly accurate predictions' about the rise of the ISIS terror army since 'before the 2012 election'
Obama insisted in his campaign speeches that year that America was safe and al-Qaeda was 'on the run'
The president said during Sunday's '60 Minutes' program that his Director of National Intelligence had conceded he underestimated ISIS .
But the administration aide insisted that Obama's advisers gave him actionable information that sat and gathered dust for more than a year .
'He knew what was at stake,' the aide said of the president, and 'he knew where all the moving pieces were'
Obama takes daily intelligence briefings in writing, he explained, because no one will be able to testify about warning the president in person about threats that the White House doesn't act on ."
"A 92-year-old war veteran who shot dead an intruder at his home says he has only one regret - that he didn't shoot the alleged burglar's accomplices. Earl Jones from Boone County, Kentucky, killed Lloyd (Adam) Maxwell after the intruder broke into his home at 2am on Monday with two accomplices. He told the Enquirer: 'These people aren’t worth any more to me than a groundhog. They have our country in havoc. We got so many damned crooked people walking around today.' Second World War veteran Earl Jones at the door the intruders entered to gain access to his basement . Lloyd (Adam) Maxwell who was shot dead by Earl Jones after breaking into the pensioner's farm . Jones said that on the night of the shooting, he heard a bang . coming from the basement and walked eight paces to get his loaded .22 . caliber rifle from behind the bedroom door. He then returned to his armchair . in the living room where he had been watching the TV and lay in wait for . the intruders to enter. When Maxwell kicked the basement door open 15 minutes later Mr Jones fired off a shot at his chest and killed him. Maxwell's accomplices Ryan Dalton, 22, and Donnie Inabnit, 20,then fled, dragging the dead man with them. It was the third time the pensioner, who has worked on the same farm since 1955, has been broken into this year. Earl Jones said she was only sorry that two others who took part in the raid escaped unharmed. 'I was hoping another one would come up – I aimed right for his heart,' he said. Jones also showed little emotion over killing 24-year-old Lloyd Maxwell who was gunned down during the home invasion. 'Was I scared? Was I mad? Hell, no. Escaped unhurt: Ryan Dalton, 22, left, and Donnie Inabnit, 20, fled with their accomplices' body .

Police do not expect to charge Jones . with a crime as Kentucky as the state has a ""stand your ground law"" that . allows householders to use deadly force if they are in fear of their . lives. Jones is adamant that he was within his right to shoot the intruder at the home he has lived in since 1955. The break-in was the third he has experienced in this year. 'I didn’t go to war for nothing. I . have the right to carry a gun. That’s what I told the police this . morning.” according to the Enquirer newspaper. Police said Dalton, 22, and  Inabnit, 20, were arrested later. The pair called police to report their friend had been shot. They later admitted to taking part in the raid on Jones's home. Dalton and Inabnit, both from Dry . Ridge, have been charged with second degree burglary and tampering with . evidence, but Mr Jones may yet escape conviction thanks to Kentucky's . 'castle doctrine' which is enshrined in law. Nationally the killing of criminals by individuals trying to defend their property has increased in recent years, from 196 in 2005 to 278 in 2010, according to FBI Uniform Crime Report statistics. Kenton County Police found Maxwell’s body and two uninjured men in a 2001 Chevrolet Impala who later admitted to being at Jones' home. In April, thieves stole 90 of Mr Jones' cows from a field behind his property and in August burglars took a television, a several thousand dollars and a personal cheque from his house.","Earl Jones, 92, insists: 'These people aren’t worth any more to me than a groundhog'

"Nine thousand Nazi war criminals fled to South America after the Second World War, it has been revealed for the first time. After receiving tip-offs, German prosecutors were recently granted access to secret files in Brazil and Chile that confirmed the true number of Third Reich immigrants. According to the documents, an . estimated 9,000 war criminals escaped to South America, including . Croatians, Ukrainians, Russians and other western Europeans who aided . the Nazi murder machine. War criminals: Secret files have revealed that an estimated 9,000 Nazis, including Holocaust mastermind Adolf Eichmann (left) and  Auschwitz . doctor Josef Mengele (right), fled to South America in the aftermath of the Second World War . Most, perhaps as many as 5,000, went to Argentina; between . 1,500 and 2,000 are thought to have made it to Brazil; around 500 to . 1,000 to Chile; and the rest to Paraguay and Uruguay. These numbers do not include several hundred more who fled to the safety of right-wing regimes in the Middle East. Previous estimates as to how many Nazis fled to South America have varied wildly from 5,000 to 300,000. The files also showed that during the war Argentine President General Juan Peron . sold 10,000 blank Argentine passports to ODESSA – the organisation set . up to protect former SS men in the event of defeat. Kurt Schrimm, 62, head of the central war criminal authority in Germany, is among the legal team sifting through archives. He said: 'These documents provide the hottest leads we have had for years.' Mr . Schrimm said a female historian provided the clues about the Nazis who . got away, who included Holocaust mastermind Adolf Eichmann, Auschwitz . doctor Josef Mengele and Treblinka death camp commander Franz Stangl. During the war, Argentinian President Juan Peron, pictured with his wife Eva in Buenos Aires in 1950, sold 10,000 blank Argentine passports to ODESSA - the organisation set up to protect former SS men in the event of defeat . Adolf Eichmann hid under the alias of Ricardo Klement in Argentina as early as 1952. He raised his family and worked in a car plant. During the war, Eichmann was the right-hand-man to SS chief Heinrich Himmler in the Third Reich -  who was responsible for the trains that carried millions to their deaths at extermination camps in Nazi occupied Poland. Eichmann was hanged in Israel in 1962. Josef Mengele was known for his horrific genetic experiments in concentration camps including the dissection of live babies and injecting dye into the eyes of prisoners. He hid out in Argentina until his death in 1979. Several others escaped to Chile. Walter Rauff a high-ranking SS officer who invented the 'Death Trucks' - with which 500,000 prisoners were murdered with lethal gas at Auschwitz - arrived in South America in 1950. He spent a short amount of time in jail and died in Santiago in 1984. Paul Schaeffer began his career in the Hitler Youth before rising through the ranks and arrived in Chile in 1960. He was a known paedophile but was not locked up by Chilean authorities until 1996. He died in 2010. There is also the hope that the mountain of documents may throw up a living fugitive. But . Mr Schrimm added: 'Each day that passes makes that less and less likely . but I do not want people to say in the future that we did not try.' Mr Schrimm and his colleague Uwe Steintz, 52, believe the archives may also provide clues to Nazis who sneaked back to the Fatherland to live out their days undetected. Of particular interest to the hunters are details of the so-called 'rat lines' - the escape routes out of a shattered Europe after WW2 that allowed an estimated 800 murderers to escape on passports provided by the Vatican. Since arriving in South America three weeks ago, Mr Schrimm and Mr Steintz have pored over the Arquivo Historico records in Rio de Janiero. The Archivo Nacional is the repository for all immigration documents. They show that 20,000 Germans settled in Brazil alone between 1945 and 1959. Mr Schrimm said: 'Many are under a false name with a dark past.' Many South American countries postwar were ruled by fascist-style military dictatorships that welcomed the brutal servants of Nazism with few questions asked. Mr Steintz said: 'Already we see something of a pattern in the way these criminals operated. They almost always entered the country alone and sent for their families afterwards. 'And most entered on a passport of the International Red Cross. Eight hundred higher functionaries of the SS and Nazi state entered Argentina alone on such passports.' The files show that the contact point for many was German Bishop Alois Hudal, priest-confessor to the German Catholic community in Rome. Investigators hope that the files will yield up cross references to the secret services of Chile and Brazil detailing names of intelligence agents who helped the Nazi war criminals.","As many as 5,000 Nazis went to Argentina .
Between 1,500 and 2,000 ended up in Brazil .
Around 500 to 1,000 settled in Chile .
The rest started new lives in Paraguay and Uruguay ."
"Crowds of pro-Russian demonstrators have stormed government buildings in several major cities in eastern Ukraine. In Donetsk, 50 miles west of the Russian border, a large group of people, including many in masks carrying sticks and stones, surged into the provincial government building and smashed windows.

A photographer reported seeing people bringing car tyres to be used as barricades against any presumed attempt by authorities to retake the building. Eastern Ukraine was the heartland of support for Viktor Yanukovych, the president who fled to Russia in February after months of protests. About half of the region's residents are ethnic Russians, many of whom believe Ukraine's acting authorities are Ukrainian nationalists who will oppress Russians.

"The Moroccan-born mayor of Rotterdam has said Muslim immigrants who do not appreciate the way of life in Western civilisations can 'f*** off'. Ahmed Aboutaleb, who arrived in the Netherlands aged 15, spoke out in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris last week. Appearing on live television just hours after the shootings, Mayor Aboutaleb said Muslims who 'do not like freedom can pack your bags and leave'. Dutch courage: Ahmed Aboutaleb, mayor of Rotterdam, said that Muslim immigrants who do not appreciate freedom of speech enjoyed in the Netherlands can 'f*** off' Labour politician Ahmed Aboutaleb, a former journalist who was appointed mayor of the Dutch city in 2008, is known for his straightforward stance on integration. The 53-year-old won the praise of London-mayor Boris Johnson over his comments last week attacking fellow Muslims who move to Western nations but refuse to accept the Western way of life. 'It is incomprehensible that you can turn against freedom,' Mayor Aboutaleb told Dutch current affairs program Nieuwsuur (Newshour). 'But if you don't like freedom, for heaven's sake pack your bags and leave. 'If you do not like it here because some humorists you don't like are making a newspaper, may I then say you can f*** off. Speaking out: Mayor Aboutaleb, a Moroccan-born Muslim, told immigrants to 'vanish from the Netherlands if you cannot find your place here' 'This is stupid, this so incomprehensible.  Vanish from the Netherlands if you cannot find your place here. All those well-meaning Muslims here will now be stared at'. 'My hero': London Mayor Boris Johnson said Aboutaleb was 'straight to the point' Mayor Aboutaleb grew up the son of an imam in northern Morocco, but moved to the Netherlands in 1976. After working as a reporter he became a civil servant before being appointed State Secretary for Social Affairs and Employment in 2007. When he was appointed mayor of Rotterdam, the second largest city in the country with a population of more than 610,000, he became the first immigrant in such a position in the Netherlands. Mayor Aboutaleb, who represents the Dutch Labour Party, de Partij van de Arbeid, has long had a no-nonsense approach to immigration and integration. Speaking to the Observer shortly after his appointment he said his message to immigrants is 'stop seeing yourself as victims, and if you don't want to integrate, leave'. This week, London Mayor Boris Johnson hailed Mayor Aboutaleb as his 'hero'  and 'straight to the point'. 'That is the voice of the Enlightenment, of Voltaire,' Mr Johnson wrote in the Daily Telegraph. 'If we are going to win the struggle for the minds of these young people, then that is the kind of voice we need to hear - and it needs above all to be a Muslim voice.'","Ahmed Aboutaleb, a Moroccan-born Muslim, spoke after Paris attack .

"Children born as a result of IVF are a third more likely to get cancer, a major study found. Scientists said those born after fertility treatments were 33 per cent more likely to have childhood cancer. They were 65 per cent more likely to develop leukaemia and 88 per cent more likely to develop cancers of the brain and central nervous system. Children born as a result of IVF are more likely to develop childhood cancer . The study suggests fertility treatment may change the way certain genes function when they are passed from parent to child in a process known as ‘genomic imprinting’. These faults in genes are linked to childhood cancers, the Danish researchers said. They warned these changes could be triggered by aspects of fertility treatment such as exposure to hormones, semen preparation, freezing embryos, growth conditions of embryos or delayed insemination. But they could not rule out the chance that the increased risk was the result of parents’ infertility, not the treatment. Earlier this year, British research on more than 100,000 children born after fertility treatment found they had no increased risk of cancer. In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is among the most widely used fertility techniques, with around 18,000 IVF babies born in Britain each year. The study suggests fertility treatment may change the way certain genes function when they are passed from parent to child in a process known as 'genomic imprinting' An egg is removed from the woman’s ovaries and fertilised with sperm, then returned to the womb to grow. The research, in the journal Fertility and Sterility, reviewed 25 studies from 12 developed countries, including the US, the UK, Denmark, France and Israel, from 1990 to 2010. Plans for Britain to become the first country to create babies using DNA from three parents were condemned by MPs last night. The treatment can reduce the risk of children having potentially fatal illnesses. Damaged DNA from a mother at risk of passing on a mitochondrial disease such as muscular dystrophy is substituted with some from a healthy female donor. The technique was recommended to Government by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority this year after a consultation. The eight MPs were among 34 members of the Council of Europe, the human rights group made up of European politicians, who called it ‘incompatible with human dignity and international law’. ‘The results of the largest meta-analysis on this topic to date indicate an association between fertility treatment and cancer in offspring,’ wrote author Dr Marie Hargreave, of the Danish Cancer Society research centre, Copenhagen. ‘The etiology [origin] of childhood cancer is still largely unknown, but it has been hypothesized that fertility treatment may play a role.’ One theory is that anti-oestrogen drugs that stimulate ovulation are similar to diethylstilbestrol, a drug once given to pregnant women to stop complications, but later linked to childhood cancer. The researchers stressed that the risk of cancer among children born after fertility treatment remains low. They wrote: ‘Infertile couples may already have an increased number of epigenetic defects . . . which come to light through the treatment process.’ Most children in the studies were born after IVF but some couples used other techniques such as intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection or intrauterine insemination. Dr Allan Pacey, the chairman of the British Fertility Society, said: ‘Although this paper reports an apparent increase in the incidence in childhood cancer, the association is small and it is still not possible to say whether it is a consequence of IVF or the underlying infertility of the parents.’ Cancer is the second biggest cause of death of children in developed countries. Around 1,600 children are diagnosed each year in Britain. A spokesman for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority said: ‘A recent UK study found there to be no increased risk of cancer to children as a result of assisted reproduction treatment.’ Geeta Nargund is medical director at Create Health Clinics, which promotes ‘mild IVF’, with fewer fertility jabs and lower dosages. She said: ‘This is an interesting study which raises concerns about potential long-term effects of fertility treatment on children.’","IVF babies are 65 per cent more likely to develop leukaemia .

"A number of militants have been killed in Islamic State's very first battle with U.S. ground troops after the extremists attempted to overrun an Iraqi military base. The militants attacked Ein al-Asad military base on Sunday where more than 100 U.S. military support troops are based. Despite launching the surprise attack just after midnight, ISIS's offensive was swiftly repelled when U.S. troops and F18 jets joined in the skirmish in support of the Iraqi Army. Scroll down video . A US Navy Seal team secures the airfield at Ein al-Asad base during a visit by former president George W Bush . US military experts arrived at Ein al-Asad airbase (pictured) last month to help train and support Iraqi forces . Facing both Iraqi and US troops supported by F18 jets, an unknown number of ISIS attackers were killed during the two hour firefight before being forced to retreat. Ein al-Asad came under repeated attack by ISIS troops in October, however, now bolstered by the U.S. assistance, it poses a much more formidable target. Sheikh Mahmud Nimrawi, a tribal leader in the region, said 'US forces intervened because ISIS started to come near the base, which they are stationed in, so (it was) out of self-defense,' Shafaq News reported. He added: 'We have made progress in (the) al-Dolab area, in which ISIS has withdrawn from.' During the Iraq War, it was the largest airbase located within Iraq's Anbar province. Although it scaled down in size following the conclusion of the war, it remains in use by the Iraq Army and is located deep within the remote areas on the front line against ISIS. Meanwhile, Kurdish forces have launched an operation to retake the town of Sinjar in northwest Iraq after coalition planes pounded Islamic State positions overnight, Kurdish officials said. The peshmerga fighters made gains against ISIS throughout the day, the officials said, driving the militants out of at least eight sub-districts in the Zumar area, east of Sinjar. Ein al-Asad military airbase is located north-west of Baghdad (illustrated) and is a strategically important site for the Iraqi Army . ISIS militants (pictured) failed to overrun the large military base in western Iraq after US troops stationed at the base assisted the Iraqi Army to repel the extremists' attack . If the peshmerga succeeded in recapturing the town, it would open up a corridor to Sinjar mountain, where hundreds of minority Yazidis have been besieged by ISIS militants since August. It would also be a symbolic victory for the Kurds, whose reputation as fearsome warriors was bruised after Islamic State overpowered the peshmerga in Sinjar and killed or captured hundreds of Yazidis. 'At 8.00 this morning the ground offensive began to liberate Sinjar town,' said one official in the Kurdish region's Security Council, adding that coalition planes had bombed the area for several hours beforehand. 'There's evidence that a lot of ISIS fighters abandoned their weapons and fled the area.' Several other Kurdish security officials gave similar accounts. U.S. President Barack Obama cited the duty to prevent an impending massacre of Yazidis by Islamic State militants as one of the main reasons for authorising the first air strikes in Iraq this summer.

"Learning to ride a bike is an important childhood milestone, but it can be expensive to upgrade models as children grow up. But now an engineer has created a bike that’s designed to grow with a child. The ‘LittleBig Bike’ is extendable so it can fit children for a full five years, during which time they would usually outgrow three bicycles. Scroll down for video . Room to grow: The ‘LittleBig Bike’ is extendable so it can fit children for five years, during which time they would usually outgrow three bicycles. The first balance bike phase is shown left and the final pedal bike, right . Aimed specifically at children from the age of two to seven, the bicycle has three different adjustable sizes, so it grows longer and taller when needed. Parents can adjust the height of the handlebars, saddle and frame to suit their child and its inventor claims there is no need for stabilisers. The bike starts its evolution as a pedal-less balance bike, its creator says is ideal for little ones learning to ride. Parents can adjust the height of the handlebars, saddle and frame to suit their child and its inventors claim there is no need for stabilisers. Here, children between the ages of two and seven show the different phases of the bike, with the oldest child riding a pedal bike instead of balance bikes (shown in red and pink) Phase one: The bike starts its evolution as a pedal-less balance bike (pictured) that its creator says is ideal for little ones learning to ride . Mr Evans was working in a bike shop when he got the inspiration for the bicycle. ‘I was working as a mechanic and sales person and it was there that I came across balance bikes and saw how quickly kids were comfortable on them. ‘Often small kids would just jump onto one and start zooming around the shop, it just seemed so natural for them. ‘Unfortunately though, normal balance bikes are very small and kids quickly grow out of them. ‘On top of that, when a child is ready to begin using a pedal bike, the parents needed to come back and buy a new bike. ‘Being an engineer, my creative mind began churning out ideas and many iterations, prototypes and pondering sleepless nights later, the LittleBig was born.’ By moving and reattaching the rear frame, it can be turned into a larger balance bike with a taller seat and handlebars. As the child becomes bigger, parents can increase the bike to its largest size - equivalent to a 16-inch bike - and attach pedals to it. Engineer, Simon Evans, 33, set up the company LittleBig Bikes in his hometown of Wicklow, Ireland. ‘The LittleBig is great for kids aged two to seven as it allows them to learn to balance and steer with the comfort of having their feet near the ground,’ he said. ‘While sitting on the low saddle, the child pushes off the ground with their feet ""Fred Flintstone"" style and as their confidence increases they can glide along easily.’ The third stage means the bicycle can be converted into a proper pedal bike. He said: ‘It's suitable for kids up to age seven and there's no need for stabilisers. ‘Having learned to balance first, the child will have a quick and effortless transition to the pedal bike. ‘These adaptions allow the LittleBig to be used for five years, over twice as long as traditional kids bikes, while giving the parent good value for money. ‘It's high quality and built like a proper bike, unlike many of the throwaway kids bikes that are currently on the market.’ The bike is made from aluminium and weighs 11.3 lbs (5.1kg) in its simplest form and 14.6 lbs (6.6kg) fully extended with pedals. It can be bought online from LittleBig Bike's website for £155 ($243).

"Dutch soldiers are responsible for the massacre of 300 Muslims at Srebrenica in the 1995 Bosnian war and must pay their families compensation, a court has ruled. Peacekeepers from the Netherlands who were meant to be guarding the town turned away the victims from their compound in the village of Potocari during the bloody conflict and handed them over to Bosnian Serb forces. They were then killed by the Bosnian Serb army led by General Ratko Mladic - who is himself on trial for war crimes. Scroll down for video . Victims: Pictured are mourners at a memorial service this year for victims of the Srebrenica massacre . Graves: A Bosnian Muslim stands among graves erected in memory of the 8,000 victims of the 1995 killing . This week a district court at The Hague decided that members of the Dutchbat force could have known the refugees would be massacred if they did not help them - and were therefore liable for their deaths. The court ruled that the . Dutch peacekeeping troops could have protected the 300-plus men and . boys who were among thousands of Muslims - mainly women, children and . elderly people - taking shelter in a Dutch compound inside the . UN-declared safe haven of Srebrenica. The troops - part of a Dutch UN battalion known as Dutchbat - handed over those in the compound two days after the town fell. The . Bosnian Serb troops then killed the Muslim men and boys, who 'would . have survived if Dutchbat had acted properly,' said Presiding Judge . Larissa Alwin. In total 8,000 were killed at Srebrenica, although the court cleared the Dutch of responsibility for the other 7,700 deaths. Investigations: An excavator is pictured in 2005 excavating a body believed to be one of the Srebrenica victims who was transported to a distant mass grave . The . court said the Netherlands was not liable for the deaths of those who . had fled into the forests surrounding Srebrenica, where many of the men . and boys were later buried in mass graves. Although those people had protection in the UN safe haven they were never directly in the custody of the Dutch troops, the court ruled. 'Dutchbat cannot be held liable for their fate,' the ruling read. In . an emotionally-charged hearing attended by a handful of victims' relatives, the judge said the peacekeepers should have known that the . men taken from the compound would be slain because there was already . evidence of the Serbs committing war crimes. 'By co-operating in the deportation of these men, Dutchbat acted unlawfully,' Judge Alwin said. The ruling could set a precedent with implications for future peacekeeping deployments by the Netherlands or other countries. It could be appealed, however, meaning it is unlikely to resolve . the Dutch national trauma over the country's role in the worst massacre . on European soil since the Second World War. During the . Bosnian war, the Dutch battalion Dutchbat had been deployed to protect . Srebrenica, which had been designated a safe haven by the United . Nations. But on . July 13, 1995, the peacekeepers bowed to pressure from Bosnian Serb . forces commanded by General Mladic and forced thousands of Muslim . families out of their fenced-off compound. Evidence: This video, shown at the trial of former Serbian president Slobadan Milosevic, was said to show victims of the killings along with Serbian soldiers . The Bosnian Serb forces . sorted the Muslims by gender, then drove the males away and began . killing them in what would become the bloody climax to the 1992-95 . Bosnian war, a slaughter that international courts have ruled was . genocide. The war claimed 100,000 lives in all, and was the bloodiest of a series of conflicts that accompanied the break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. The Srebrenica bodies . were piled into hastily-made mass graves, which were later bulldozed . and scattered among other burial sites in an attempt to hide the . evidence. The . case was brought by the Mothers of Srebrenica, a group representing . surviving relatives of the victims. They had failed in their bid to have . a court find the United Nations responsible for the massacre. 'At . the moment that the men were sent away, Dutchbat knew or should have . known that the genocide was taking place and therefore there was a . serious risk that those men would be killed,' said judge Peter Blok. The . failure of Dutch soldiers to protect the Muslim men and boys of . Srebrenica had deep repercussions, contributing to the resignation of . the Dutch government in 2002. Relatives of the dead welcomed the limited finding of liability but lamented that it did not go further. 'Obviously . the court has no sense of justice,' said Munira Subasic, president of . Mothers of Srebrenica. 'How is it . possible to divide victims, and tell one mother that the Dutch state is . responsible for the death of her son on one side of the wire and not for . the son on the other side?' The court did not say how much compensation the families should receive, and the figure will be worked out between lawyers and the Dutch government once any appeals have run their course. A lawyer for the relatives, Marco Gerritsen, said he would study the 89-page ruling before deciding whether to appeal. It remains to be seen what effect the ruling will have on UN recruitment for peacekeeping missions. Dutch Defence . Ministry spokesman Klaas Meijder said the Dutch government began . insisting on stricter safeguards for its troops involved in UN missions . after the Srebrenica massacre, but would not speculate on whether . Wednesday's ruling would have a further impact. 'What this means for future missions, I can't say,' he said.","Dutch peacekeepers turned victims away from their compound .

"A massive European satellite is expected to plummet down to earth Monday - and no can predict with accuracy where exactly its debris is going to land. Europe's Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer, or GOCE, was just 99 miles above Earth and dropping at a rate of 8 miles per day, operations manager Christoph Steiger wrote in a status report posted on the European Space Agency's website. ‘Re-entry into the atmosphere (is) probably less than two days away,’ Steiger said. The European Space Agency (ESA) claims one of its sleek research satellites, dubbed the 'Ferrari of space' has plummeted somewhere into the South Atlantic ocean . The 1.2-ton, $466million science satellite built by German and Italian engineers was launched in 2009 to map variations in Earth's gravity, and now it is doomed by its force. Scientists assemble the data into the first detailed global maps of the boundary between the planet's crust and mantle, among other projects. Full name: Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer . Launched: 17 March 2009 . Launcher: Rockot (with Breeze-KM upper stage) by Eurockot Launch Services GmbH . Launch site: Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia . Nominal life: 20 months . Cost: $466million . Orbit: About 161.5 miles altitude, polar, Sun-synchronous . Mass: 2,000lbs . Dimensions: 17.4 feet long, about 3.3 foot body diameter . Propulsion tank: 88.2lbs of xenon gas . Mission: Measuring Earth's gravity field and modelling the geoid with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution . The arrowhead-shaped GOCE ran out of xenon fuel on October 21 and has been steadily losing altitude since, tugged by Earth's gravity. The satellite was intended to orbit at 160 miles, but on Saturday morning it hovering at just 105 miles. With its aerodynamic design featuring wings and tail fins, GOCE has been called the ‘Ferrari of space.’ Most of the spacecraft will burn up as it blasts through the atmosphere, but up 25 per cent of the satellite is expected to survive re-entry and end up somewhere on the planet's surface. Jeffrey Kluger, senior science and technology editor for Time Magazine, told CBS that earthlings have no cause for panic, but people should be ‘a little bit worried’ about the plunging pile of scorched space debris. ‘Whenever you have one ton of hardware coming down, no one knows where, that's not a good thing,’ he said. With two-thirds of Earth covered by water and vast areas of sparsely populated land, the risk to human life and property is considered extremely low, the European Space Agency said. Rocket science: GOCE is seen on show at the Turin Thales Alenia space facility before press day, on July 18, 2007 . Space mission: GOCE was launched in 2009 to map variations in Earth's gravity with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution . Kluger explained that it is estimated that about 45 pieces of satellite debris, each weighing no more than 200lbs, will breach the atmosphere and land within a footprint of 190 square miles. ‘So a satellite would practically have to be aiming at your house to strike it,’ Kluger wrote in his Friday Time column. Skyfall: Jeffrey Kluger, senior science and technology editor for Time Magazine, said that earthlings should be 'a little bit worried' about the plunging pile of scorched space debris . Due to constant changes in Earth's upper atmosphere, scientists cannot yet predict where and when GOCE will re-enter. Satellites that are too bulky to bring down safely to Earth after they had served their purpose are sometimes boosted into one of the graveyard orbits more than 22,000 miles up, where they can hang around for centuries. For GOCE, however, it was not a viable option because the satellite only has a small, weak ion engine on board. The last big satellite to fall back through the atmosphere was Russia's failed Phobos-Grunt Mars probe. The 14-ton spacecraft re-entered in January 2012. In 2011, NASA's 6.5-ton Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite and Germany's 2.4-ton X-ray ROSAT telescope re-entered. Heiner Klinkrad, head of the European . Space Agency's space debris office in Germany, told the site Spaceflight Now that statistically . speaking, it is 250,000 times more likely to win the jackpot in the . German lottery than to get hit by a GOCE fragment. About . 100 tons of space debris falls to Earth every year, and so far there . have been no reports of injuries of fatalities caused by extra-terrestrial . scrap metal. In living color: In this handout image supplied by the European Space Agency, a rendering of the variations in Earth's gravitational pull is shown as seen by the Europe's GOCE satellite . However, under UN’s Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects created in September of 1972, should a space fragment cause damage upon re-entry, the country that launched the satellite would be held accountable, Fox News reported. The treaty, which has been ratified by 88 countries as of January 2013, guarantees that the state responsible will pay compensation. In the case of GOCE, the satellite was launched from Russia, so that country would be on the hook for any damage.","Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer, or GOCE, was launched in 2009 to map variations in Earth's gravity .

"MI5 and Scotland Yard were close to arresting hate preacher Abu Hamza four years before the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001, court papers reveal. The documents represent a blow to Hamza’s claims in a New York Court that he had been working with the security services while he was at Finsbury Park Mosque in north London as a force for good. Hamza was eventually jailed in 2005 for inciting murder and racial hatred.

Hamza claimed that he was a force for good in his ramblings and worked with the police and security services. MI5 has announced it was close to arresting him in 1997 . The 56-year-old was extradited to the US nearly two years ago on terror charges. Recording a meeting with Hamza in October 1997, an MI5 officer wrote: ‘I reasserted the view that over the past few months in particular, he had walked a dangerous tightrope and had come close to being culpable for incitement to violence .  .  . the Security Service, in particular, took a dim view of those advocating violence, even if the violence was perpetrated overseas.’ Muslim cleric Abu Hamza said that he was helping to keep the streets of Britain safe but still felt the need to have a masked bodyguard . MI5 claims that it was planning to arrest Abu Hamza four years before the terrorist attack on New York on September 11, 2001 . MI5 agent Reda Hassaine, who infiltrated the mosque, said: ‘Hamza was able to recruit and brainwash vulnerable young men and raise huge amounts of cash for his contacts overseas. ‘The security services seemed incapable of putting it in its proper al-Qaeda context. 'They continued to view it as a little local skirmish by a clown.’","On trial in New York Hamza claims he helped to keep British streets safe .

"Russia today dispatched six warships to its naval base in Syria in a move that is likely to spark concern in the West. A flotilla led by an anti-submarine destroyer have sailed from the Arctic port of Severomorsk to Tartus. However, military sources claim the deployment is nothing to do with the growing tensions in the country where the crackdown by . government troops against opposition forces has intensified in recent . weeks. Dispatched: The Russian Admiral Chabanenko destroyer (file photo) and three landing craft will be joined in the Mediterranean by a Russian patrol ship and an assistance vessel in a move likely to concern the West . It comes as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has . proposed ending Syria's conflict 'step by step', starting with districts . that have seen the worst violence, UN secretary general Kofi Annan . told a news conference in Tehran today. 'He made a suggestion of building an . approach from the ground up in some of the districts where we have . extreme violence - to try and contain the violence in those districts . and, step by step, build up and end the violence across the country,' Annan said. He declined to give details, saying the plan needed to be discussed with the Syrian opposition. Violence: A man looks at a damaged area in Deraa, Syria, yesterday. Russian military sources have said the deployment of the ships 'was not linked to the escalation of the situation in Syria .

'The programme of the voyage includes a call in the Syrian port of Tartus,' a military source told Interfax news agency. He claimed the deployment 'was not linked to the escalation of the situation in Syria.' The West may not see it the same way, having strongly criticised Russia for refusing to cut its military and political ties to Damascus despite the bloodshed in the country. 'In Tartus the ships will top up on supplies of fuel, water and foodstuffs,' said the source. The flotilla is deploying in the Mediterranean, it was claimed. The naval deployment can only buttress Russia's diplomatic muscle. Moscow is adamant that Syria should resolve its own problems without outside interference. Last month, Britain forced a cargo vessel loaded with Soviet-era helicopter gunships and possible missiles to return to Russia by withdrawing its London-based insurance which contravened an EU embargo on military supplies to Syria. Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 17,129 people have been killed . in the country's 16-month-old revolt so far. Around 884 defectors have been killed in . the crackdown on the protest movement that began in spring 2011 and has . since turned into an armed rebellion. The total death toll included members of the security forces still loyal to Assad, of whom 4,348 have died. Cyprus has also drawn up plans to take in up . to 200,000 refugees from the fighting.

"Islam: The Untold Story, a documentary by historian Tom Holland, pictured, sparked a backlash by viewers and has now been cancelled . Channel 4 has been forced to cancel a screening of the controversial documentary Islam: The Untold Story, after the presenter was threatened with physical violence. Historian Tom Holland received abusive messages on Twitter and warnings he would come to harm because of the film, in which he suggests that Islam is a 'made-up' religion. The programme has already been aired on Channel 4, sparking more than 1,200 complaints, but the broadcaster was planning a screening for 'opinion formers' at its London headquarters later this month. It had hoped to organise a debate around the screening but the whole event has had to be axed because of fears it would be targeted. Critics have accused Holland of distorting the history of the religion in Islam: The Untold Story. His investigation into its origins claimed that there is little written contemporary evidence about the prophet Mohammed. He also suggests the Koran makes little or no reference to Islam’s holy city of Mecca, and argues there is no evidence for the general assertion that Islam began 'fully formed' in the 7th century. Instead Holland says it has developed over the centuries into the religion we know today. The Islamic Education and Research Academy accused him of making 'baseless assumptions' and engaging in 'selective scholarship'. Holland received abusive tweets questioning his views on the religion. Some posted physical threats to the Cambridge-educated historian via Twitter, while one called him a ‘fool’ for suggesting Islam is a ‘made-up religion’. Ofcom – which received 150 of the complaints regarding the programme’s inaccuracy, alleged bias and offence to Muslims – said it was considering launching an investigation. A Channel 4 spokeswoman said: 'Having taken security advice, we have reluctantly cancelled a planned screening of the programme Islam: The Untold Story. We remain extremely proud of the film which is still available to view on 4oD.' Holland's investigation into Islam's origins claimed that there is little written contemporary evidence about the prophet Mohammed . Holland, the author of best-sellers Rubicon and Persian Fire, said that Islam is 'a legitimate subject of historical inquiry'. Writing on the Channel 4 website after complaints to both the channel and watchdog Ofcom, he said: 'We were of course aware when making the programme that we were touching deeply held sensitivities and went to every effort to ensure that the moral and civilizational power of Islam was acknowledged in our film, and the perspective of Muslim faith represented, both in the persons of ordinary Bedouin in the desert, and one of the greatest modern scholars of Islam, Seyyed Hossein Nasr.' Holland was defended by Dr Jenny Taylor who runs the charity Lapido Media, which encourages better understanding and reporting of religion in the media. 'He’s shown all of us that Islam is interesting enough to be taken seriously. He’s refused to stick his head in the sand and play blind about the problems or internal tensions that all thinking Muslims know are there,' she said. 'He’s not trammelled the sacred heart of an ancient mystery but found hints of an even greater and more awesome reality that is tantalisingly beyond our grasp at the moment, but could just be the key to a shared past and shared future.' Last month BBC comedy series Citizen Khan, about a Muslim community leader, received 200 complaints following its first episode. Citizen Khan, about a Muslim community leader, sparked hundreds of complaints from viewers who said it took the 'mickey out of Islam' It was claimed that the programme 'takes the mickey out of Islam', was guilty of 'stereotypes about Asians' and was 'disrespectful to the Koran'. One scene that particularly provoked anger was where a heavily-made up girl, Mr Khan's daughter, rushed to put on a hijab and pretended to be reading the Koran when her father entered. The six-part series, which aired for the first time on BBC1 in August, was created by British Muslim Adil Ray, who also plays the lead role.","Historian Tom Holland received online abuse after programme prompted more than 1,200 complaints ."
"Each month a new planet is discovered that bears similarities to our own - and it is becoming increasingly apparent Earth is not unique. So it stands to reason that of the billions of Earth-like planets in our galaxy alone, there might be another that hosts life. It’s a thought that is gaining more credence all the time, and now Nasa has released a fascinating book detailing how, or if, we might communicate with some of these worlds. A new book made for Nasa called Archaeology, Anthropology and Interstellar Communication details the methods through which we might communicate with aliens. Although this artist's illustration is a bit fanciful, the authors suggest that Earth may already have been visited . Some of the most interesting chapters tackle the issue of alien communication in the past, present and future. In . one section, for example, William Edmondson from the University of . Birmingham considers the possibility that rock art on Earth is of . extraterrestrial origin. ‘We . can say little, if anything, about what these patterns signify, why . they were cut into rocks, or who created them,’ he writes. ‘For all intents and purposes, they might have been made by aliens.’ The book is titled Archaeology, Anthropology and Interstellar Communication. In 1959, . Cornell physicists Gieuseppi Cocconi and Philip Morrison published an . article discussing the potential to use microwave radio to communicate . between stars. A . year later in 1960, astronomer Frank Drake conducted the first hunt for . alien life with an 85-foot (25 metres) antenna in West Virgina, but . after two months concedes defeat.In the 1960s, Soviet Union performs extensive searches for ET, again with no success. In the 1970s Nasa began to take an interest in Seti, with the chances of success seemingly growing as technology advanced. In 1988, Nasa began sweeping surveys of the night sky for signals, but Congress terminated funding a few years later. The independent Seti Institute, established in 1984, took over the job. In 1992 the first planet outside the solar system is confirmed, an almost certainly uninhabitable world orbiting a pulsar. In 2009 Nasa’s Kepler telescope launches and, over the next few years, finds hundreds of planets. And . just last month, the first planet of a similar size to Earth and at the . correct distance from its parent star to host water, called Kepler . 186-f, was found. It is the most likely place that has been found that could host life as we know it. It was edited for Nasa by Douglas Vakoch, Director of Interstellar Message Composition at the Seti Institute. With the help of other experts he tackles a number of topics including the prospect of life on other planets and the means through which we might send or receive a message. Vakoch begins the 330-page book by postulating how difficult it might be to make first contact. ‘If a radio signal is detected in a modern Seti experiment, we could well know that another intelligence exists, but not know what they are saying,’ he writes in the book’s introduction. He goes on to add: ‘Even if we detect a civilisation circling one of our nearest stellar neighbours, its signals will have traversed trillions of miles, reaching Earth after travelling for years.’ But, all hope is not lost – throughout the book Vakoch and his colleagues tackle these very problems, and provide solutions that may prove invaluable in the future. ‘To move beyond the mere detection of such intelligence, and to have any realistic chance of comprehending it, we can gain much from the lessons learned by researchers facing similar challenges on Earth,’ he continues. ‘Like archaeologists who reconstruct temporally distant civilisations from fragmentary evidence, Seti researchers will be expected to reconstruct distant civilisations separated from us by vast expanses of space as well as time. ‘As we attempt to decode and interpret extraterrestrial messages, we will be required to comprehend the mindset of a species that is radically Other.’ Rock art, an example in Niger pictured, is cited as one possible example of aliens visiting Earth before. Ultimately, however, the authors detail some of the methods we might employ to search for alien life including scouring exoplanets for signs of civilisation . Elsewhere in the compendium the authors tackle the question of the possible biology, evolution and physics of an extraterrestrial race. Vakoch explains how the methods via which aliens communicate might be vastly different from our own, making contact difficult. He says that messaging through sound, as we are used to on Earth, might not be possible. ‘On the other hand, vision and the use of images would appear to be at least plausible,’ he writes. The authors also detail way we could send messages of our own through methods such as Active Seti, using giant radio dishes like the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico (pictured). They say their are immense challenges in making first contact, but we can learn lessons from the history of civilisations on Earth . And, he adds, imaging the surface of habitable planets in the future might reveal ‘the physical arrangement of objects’ that suggests the presence of alien life. Edmondson suggests, for example, that ‘an optical telescope of diameter 620 miles (1,000 miles) could resolve an object of diameter one kilometre (0.62 miles) at a distance of 100 light-years.’ Vakoch concludes his introduction with the monumental task awaiting scientists and scholars across the world, but highlights the importance of these studies and research. ‘These scholars are grappling with some of the enormous challenges that will face humanity if an information-rich signal emanating from another world is detected,’ he writes. ‘By drawing on issues at the core of contemporary archaeology and anthropology, we can be much better prepared for contact with an extraterrestrial civilisation, should that day ever come.’","A new book details the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (Seti)

"Expelled: Jordan Ford was accused of abusing a teacher online after he was told off for dying his hair . When he was suspended after turning up for school with a dyed red mohican hairstyle, Jordan Ford decided to take revenge. The 14-year-old searched his head teacher’s Facebook page and found an old picture of her with her hair dyed a bright colour. Jordan then posted the photograph, showing Keziah Featherstone dressed flamboyantly to promote World Book Day, on Facebook. Underneath the image of Miss Featherstone in a yellow and green dress, fluorescent pink Dr Martens boots, purple hair and wearing fake tattoos, he wrote: ‘This is not an example to set to other students.’ The posting attracted 50 comments, many of them abusive, and as a result Jordan was expelled from Bridge Learning Campus in Whitchurch, Bristol. The academy school said he had been excluded permanently for inciting abuse on Facebook and failing to apologise. It claims Jordan posted a number of derogatory comments about Miss Featherstone’s looks and weight. The school’s chief executive Mark Davies said the post encouraged other students to cyber bully a member of staff. But Jordan’s parents Patricia Hedges, 43, and John Ford, 46, defended their son. Mr Ford said: ‘My wife went up to the school to see if there was any chance of him going back but because he is a bit of a clown they were looking for an excuse to get rid of him. ‘We think it’s unfair. He dyed his hair red and the school made a really big thing of it but there are teachers up there with coloured hair. ‘You can’t even go to the council [to appeal against the expulsion] because the school is an academy.’ Mrs Hedges, a mother of four, said of the posting of Miss Featherstone’s picture by her son: ‘If she doesn’t want this, she should have private settings. ‘The other children commenting said much worse stuff but Jordan is the only one punished. He’s no angel but I just want him back in education.’ Image: Jordan posted his photograph of headteacher Keziah Featherstone on his Facebook page . Jordan was first told off about his hair shortly before half-term in October, when he turned up with the red mohican. The Year Nine student was told that he needed to alter the style before returning to school after the week-long break. But because his hair was still auburn, he was suspended from class for three days. It was then he took to Facebook to express his anger, using the picture of Miss Featherstone in fancy dress to promote reading. It is believed the photograph was taken before she joined Bridge. Kicked out: The teenager is now banned from returning to the Bridge Learning Campus, pictured . After teachers discovered the post, Jordan was temporarily excluded before Christmas. He was permanently excluded on January 5 and sent to another school but is now completing his studies from home. Jordan has since apologised for the Facebook post and said that he wishes to return to Bridge. He said: ‘I regret doing it. I have apologised. I shook Mr Davies’ hand and said I was sorry.’ Mr Davies said: ‘His actions were against the morals of the school. It invaded a person’s private space and he copied pictures from a staff member’s personal Facebook profile.’ Mr Davies said Jordan had refused to take part in meetings with Miss Featherstone over the postings, which were now being investigated by police as ‘malicious communications’.

"This week I must admit I’ve been feeling the January blues a tad. Winter has hit London with full freezing force and I’m still pining after the sun, sand and sea from my trip to Mexico a few weeks ago. To top it all off, my skin was really feeling the effects from soaking up all those Mexican rays. So to combat my dull, dehydrated complexion, I thought I’d treat myself to a facial at the Premier Laser Clinic in Fulham. I wanted a treatment that would refresh and clear my skin without the downtime of a peel, so I opted for the Vitamin C Rejuvenation Facial. Binky has been feeling a bit down in the dumps lately so treated herself to a Vitamin C facial in order to perk herself and her skin up . The Vitamin C facial exfoliates the outer layer of the skin by gently removing dead skin cells, leaving the complexion looking radiant and rejuvenated. It also targets the deeper levels of the dermis to promote skin cell renewal, overall resulting in a fresher, more youthful look. I was lucky enough to be treated by the Premier Laser Clinic’s treatment director Lucy Xu, who has years of experience in skincare. The Vitamin C facial exfoliates the outer layer of the skin by gently removing dead skin cells, leaving the complexion looking radiant and rejuvenated . Lucy began by applying a retinol serum to my face, to tighten skin and boost collagen production. The serum is made up of a unique blend of vitamins A, C and E, which infuse the skin with its nourishing and anti-oxidising properties. It also includes hyaluronic acid, to hydrate the skin and reduce the appearance of blemishes. After this, Lucy applied a mixture of botanical stem cells to my face to renew and revitalise the skin, as well as gently nourishing the delicate eye area. While the mixture was left to penetrate the deep layers of my skin, I was treated to a pampering shoulder and scalp massage. It was so soothing I could almost feel myself drifting off at one point! The treatment also helps to promote skin renewal resulting in a more youthful look . Finally, Lucy massaged a clarifying serum containing brightening Kojic extract into my skin, to leave it looking clear and refreshed. After a highly relaxing 45 minutes, I checked my reflection out in the mirror and was thoroughly impressed. My skin looked bright, clear, and as the facial’s name promised, completely rejuvenated. Lucy also prescribed me with a set of aftercare products from the Obagi 360 system range (their Exfoliating Cleanser, Retinol Serum and HydraFactor SPF moisturiser) to help me maintain my radiant glow by preventing pigmentation, dullness and breakouts. Binky says that the facial is the perfect quick fix to a flawless complexion . The Vitamin C facial is suitable for all ages and skin types – including dry, sensitive, mature and rosacea-prone skin – providing instant results that last for 6-8 weeks. One session costs £89 – book at londonpremierlaser.co.uk. If your lacklustre skin is in dire need of a pick-me-up – or if you’ve got a big night out coming up and want a quick fix to a flawless complexion – I can’t recommend it enough! That night I headed out to the Thomson Scene party with my fellow MIC castmates Lucy, Tiff and Proudlock. Thomson Scene is a new holiday offering for 18-35 year olds that love having chilled days and lively nights whilst away. The bar was set up into different ‘scenes’ which represented some of the ultra-glam destinations on offer such as Mykonos, Santorini and Ibiza and more exotic long-haul destinations like Goa, Mexico and Thailand. Binky recently returned from sunny Mexico where she tried out the ultra-glam glitter lips trend . I kept my make-up minimal as I wanted to show off my glowy visage, but discovered these amazing Glitter Lips at the party which completely transformed my look! You can easily create this look for yourself in three simple steps: . Step 1: PREP . Exfoliate your lips with a sugar scrub or toothbrush to get rid of any chapping or dry skin. This will encourage blood circulation in your lips too, making them appear plumper. Follow up with a non-greasy lip balm like DHC Lip Cream to give your pout a super-smooth, soft finish. Binky rocking the beauty look with Lucy (left) and Tiffany Watson (right) who joined her on holiday . Step 2: COLOUR . Next it’s time to add your base lip colour. Opt for a product with a bold, matte finish to give the look optimum longevity. To recreate my vivid purple-pink look, sweep two layers of Too Faced Melted Liquified Long Wear Lipstick in Melted Violet over your lips. Step 3: GLITTER . Now it’s time to get glitzy! Start by applying a slick of clear lipgloss like Guerlain Gloss d’Enfer in L’Oiseau De Feu over your pout to hold the glitter in place. Then gently pat a glitter pigment such as Too Faced Glamour Dust in Pink Fire all over your lips with your fingertip, focusing on the middle for fuller-looking smackers. Finally, set your glittering pout in place with a spritz of Clarins Fix’ Make Up Spray to ensure your lips’ll be sparkling all through the night.

"When Lisa Holmes decided to give up smoking, she was looking forward to improving her health and her bank balance. Like most ex-smokers, she was braced to gain some weight  - but was totally unprepared for what happened to her bust. Ms Holmes, 46, says her fluctuating weight - simply going from a size 10 to 12 - 'destroyed' her 34B breasts. This is due to the stone in weight she gained suddenly after quitting - most of which went on her chest - and subsequently lost. Lisa Holmes, 46, says quitting her 30-a-day smoking habit 'destroyed' her 34B breasts (she is pictured here before quitting). Ditching cigarettes made her gain weight, which she then lost, affecting her bust size . And she claims quitting left them so deflated that she was forced to spend the cash she saved on cigarettes getting a breast enlargement. Her new £4,000 breasts are, she says, an expensive reminder never to smoke again. She said: ‘I never considered giving up smoking would have an effect on my bust but the changes my body went through completely ruined my breasts. ‘The cup size didn’t change, but because I gained and then lost weight on my boobs I lost all the volume so looked very flat and withered. ‘It was later explained to me that the sudden weight gain and loss on my breasts had caused sagginess. ‘I gave up smoking because I wanted to feel better about myself but I actually felt worse. ‘I couldn’t believe I had gone through not only giving up smoking but then gaining and losing weight which only seemed to go to and from my breasts only to end up more unhappy with myself. ‘I’d saved a fortune on cigarettes so I decided to go for surgery to reward myself.’ Mrs Holmes, who works as a lorry driver, started smoking when she was 16. For many years, she maintained a slim size 10, weighing around nine stone while smoking 30 a day. At 5ft 6in tall, with a 34B, bust she felt perfectly in proportion. But that all changed three years ago in January 2012 when she gave up smoking as her New Year resolution. Ms Holmes said: ‘The cup size didn’t change, but because I gained and then lost weight on my boobs I lost all the volume so looked very flat and withered. I gave up smoking because I wanted to feel better about myself but I actually felt worse' And she claims quitting left them so deflated that she was forced to spend the cash she saved on cigarettes getting a breast enlargement, going from a 34B to 34E (pictured) Her new £4,000 34E breasts are  an expensive reminder never to smoke up again, she says . She says: ‘I’d been thinking about it for a long time. I was worried about the effects on my health and the long term damage I had already caused to my body. ‘I should have done it years earlier and didn’t want to leave it any longer.’ Former smokers gain up to 11lbs in weight after they kick the habit. UK and French researchers found that former smokers gained an average of 10lbs in the 12 months after they quit. Most of the excess weight is gained during the first three months, they found. It is nearly double the typical 6.6lbs quoted in quitting advice leaflets. Analysing the results from 62 studies, the authors discovered that in the first three months after giving up, former smokers gain an average of 6.3lbs. However, researchers found a large variation in weight change, with 13 per cent of people gaining more than 22lbs and 16 per cent losing some weight. The study, published on bmj.com, was accompanied by an editorial which suggests that health benefits from quitting outweigh the excess weight gain. But like many who stop smoking, Mrs Holmes began to put on weight  - and found most of it settled on her chest. She said: ‘I filled the gap left by smoking with biscuits ands nibbles. It kept my fingers busy but unfortunately that meant it started to show on my body. ‘I filled out a little all over but the difference was mainly to my bust which seemed to swell. 'I told myself it was still preferable to smoking and that I would tackle the weight gain once I was smoke free.’ So the following year when she was confident that she had beaten her addiction, Mrs Holmes who had gone up to a size 12, decided to lose the weight. She ditched snacking and started running until she was back in a size 10 dress and then even slipped down to a size eight weighing around eight stone. But when she became very aware that the process had had a terrible effect on her bust - which she describes as looking like ‘two empty flaps of skin.’ She said: ‘There was never a huge amount there but what I was left with was awful. ‘I started wearing padded bras and trying to disguise the loss of volume. I was very self conscious about my bust for the first time in my life. ‘It felt like a bit of a kick in the face when I had worked so hard on quitting smoking and losing weight only to be left with another problem.’ She said: ‘The odd thing is that I don’t look massively different now to before when I smoked, but the volume is back and I’m delighted' So when she calculated how much she had saved by breaking her habit she decided to reward herself with breast surgery. She said:  'I booked a consultation at the Transform cosmetic surgery clinic and explained that giving up smoking had destroyed my boobs. 'I asked if I could be restored to how I looked before. ‘The surgeon was wonderful and honestly explained that the sudden weight gain and loss on my breasts had caused sagginess. ‘To avoid needing an uplift too he suggested I go for slightly larger implants to fill out the loose skin I had been left with.’ Last year she went under the knife at the company's hospital in London to go from a 34B to a 34E. She said: ‘The odd thing is I don’t look massively different now to before when I smoked, but the volume is back and I’m delighted. ‘This is my reward to myself and every time I look in the mirror I am reminded how far I have come and never ever to smoke again.’","Lisa Holmes, from Stevenage, had always been happy with her 34B breasts .

"A social worker who was high on drugs as she hosted an all-night party where children as young as 13 were given cocaine and vodka has quit her job in disgrace. Susan Downing, 37, who was said to be 'gurning with her jaw swinging' during the party, pleaded guilty to allowing her house to be used for the supply of cocaine and amphetamine. She was given a two-year suspended jail term after claiming she had been 'stressed' at the time.. A 13-year-old schoolboy and a girl aged 15 who were at the 5am party in Rishton, Lancashire, said they were given cocaine to sniff through a straw and one snorted it off a key. Disgraced: Susan Downing, 37, admitted allowing her house to be used for the supply of cocaine and amphetamine . At least one other child took drugs alongside an 'all and sundry' gathering who were also offered wine, beer and spirits in the kitchen, Burnley Crown Court heard. It emerged the drugs had been supplied by a female friend of Downing who offered amphetamine to the 15-year-old girl saying: 'In order to take it, you would put it in a skin and bomb it.' Rachel MacLachlan, 32, of Rishton, pleaded guilty to supplying cocaine and offering to supply amphetamine and was jailed for three years. Police who were alerted to reports of youngsters taking drugs at Downing's party spoke to the 15-year-old girl at the party who said cocaine made her 'feel alive and gave her lots of energy.' She said parties were a 'regular thing' at the property and if the police had not become involved 'it would still be going on.' Downing, who worked alongside social services as a support worker for families and children, was also fined £250. Prosecutor Stephen Parker said the party which took place early last year came to light when a friend found out the 13-year-old boy had been 'sniffing coke' at the party and told his relatives. He was confronted but said he 'wasn't telling as he wasn't a grass.' Downing, 37, (left) was given two-year suspended jail term after pleading guilty to hosting the party and her friend Rachel MacLachlan, 32, (right) was jailed for three years for supplying drugs . Mr Parker said: 'After being pressed further and being threatened with being taken to the police station, he eventually admitted that he had had some. They then went to the police station and the child provided a urine sample which tested positive for cocaine.' The 13-year-old boy later told police 'loads of people turned up to the party' and he had vodka and cocaine. Mr Parker said: 'He said at some point everyone seemed to go to the kitchen so he and another teenager went in and people were taking cocaine. 'He said there were numerous small bags on the worktops containing what he presumed to be cocaine and they were making it into lines and snorting it through straws. 'He said another teenager was taking it, as well as Downing, MacLachlan and various others who were present. He said the teenager he was with asked Rachel if she would 'sort my mate out,' at which point she handed him a key with cocaine on, telling him not to grass. 'Downing also told him not to tell anyone. He took the cocaine through a straw, like everybody else was doing.' The 15-year-old girl  at the party  said she was given cocaine by MacLachlan after she asked for some. Mr Parker said: 'She said she saw both the defendants taking lines of cocaine. People were taking it off keys and doing lines when they split it with a credit card and snorted it through a straw or a rolled up note. She said she couldn't believe she actually knew all this.' A 13-year-old boy and a girl aged 15  snorted cocaine at the party, Burnley Crown Court (pictured) heard . 'At some point Rachel left and returned with a bag of amphetamine and asked her if she wanted some, but she declined. She said in order to take it, you would put it in a skin and bomb it.' The prosecutor said the teenager thought amphetamine had made Downing 'bad,' as she couldn't speak or stand up, was gurning and her jaw was swinging. Police searched Downing's home and recovered a bag containing cocaine from the living room, various straws with traces of cocaine on them and a  bag containing cannabis and a cannabis grinder. Downing initially claimed nobody was taking any drugs at her house and said she had never taken cocaine. But when she was later interviewed she admitted she allowed her premises to be used for drugs usage. 'She stated she worked alongside social services as a support worker for families and children and drug use would not be encouraged in any way by her employers,' said Mr Parker. Downing's defence lawyer Mr Sukhdev Garcha said his client had since referred herself for counselling and now working for a charity for the homeless, advising on housing issues. He said: 'Her behaviour was abhorrent morally and I can understand public disgust at it - but this young woman had a blip.' The lawyer said at the time, she had been at a very low ebb, had problems and was stressed. 'She worked for social services. She thought she couldn't ask for help as she thought that is being a failure,' he said. Downing (not pictured) was seen 'gurning with her jaw swinging' after taking drugs at the all-night party . 'She was isolated. She sought solace in drink which had a slippery slope to drugs. She's not proud for doing that but that's an explanation as to why the events came about. 'The arrest was a wake-up call and she had realised her behaviour was not acceptable to her and to society. She is now using her life experience she gained as a result of this offending to assist others.' MacLachlan claimed she didn't get Downing 'hooked on cocaine and she was already a user when they met. In mitigation Robert Elias, for MacLachlan, said her behaviour, committed when she was in drink and had taken drugs herself, had been dreadful and disgraceful and she had now sought counselling. He added: 'Any person hearing of that sort of behaviour, giving a young child a Class A drug, merely because he's asked for it, would be absolutely horrified. Casual drug taking is no longer for her. She seems to have turned the corner. She seems to have realised that she really has got to stop doing that. 'She is ashamed and upset. She is dismayed at what she did. She realises she has behaved in a way no right-thinking person would condone. It's a completely thoughtless and stupid thing for her to have done and she knows that.' Judge Ian Leeming, QC, said the party involved 'disgraceful and very serious criminal behaviour'. But he decided it was appropriate to suspended the custodial sentence on Downing 'after some misgivings.' He told her: 'The acts done by you are not all that different to the acts done by Miss MacLachlan. The offence of supplying cocaine to two children is a grave one.'","Social worker Susan Downing, 37, given two-year suspended jail term .

"Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad was taken to the hospital in an ambulance on Monday after he 'fell ill' at a public event. 'The governor was conscious and alert during the transport to the hospital,' Branstad's office said in a statement, noting that the 68-year-old had been 'suffering from the effects of a cold for a couple of days.' 'During the transport, paramedics took the governor’s vitals and initial tests indicate that the spell was caused by a seasonal illness,' his spokesman said. Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad was taken to a hospital on Monday after he fell ill at an event in Johnston, Iowa. Branstad's  spokesman said he was conscious during the ambulance ride and that the governor has been fighting a cold. The spell Branstad experienced was c'aused by a seasonal illness,' his office said . Recently inaugurated for a sixth term, Branstad was giving remarks at the grand opening of a research facility in Johnston, Iowa, when he began having problems with his speech and balance. The Des Moines Register said an attendee first offered him a bottle of water. He was later offered a chair, then laid down on the ground and transported to Iowa Methodist Medical Center. Branstad remained hospitalized as of Monday afternoon but he 'doing much better,' the state's Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds said at an event later in the day, according to Des Moines TV station KCCI. 'He'll be fine,' she added. The governor's public schedule was cleared for the rest of the day as a precaution, his office said, and the governor was to remain in the infirmary overnight. Branstad has had health issues in the past, including a heart attack in 2000 and a blocked artery several years ago. During a press conference on Monday morning, Branstad admitted to reporters that he both he and Reynolds were sick. 'I have a bad cold, and so does the lieutenant governor, and we are not alone,' Branstad said, according to multiple reporters in attendance. 'We have had it off and on for some time. A couple weeks or more,' he revealed. After Branstad took ill at DuPont Pioneer on Monday, Reynolds told the crowd that she and governor had 'both been fighting the flu over the past four days,' the Register said. 'We've tried very hard to keep up our schedule. If you know our great governor, he is not one to slow down or let up,' she said before officials cleared the room. Branstad was coming off a long weekend. Prospective Republican presidential candidates were in town for Iowa congressman Steve King's Freedom Summit, where they jockeyed for likely caucus-goers' support and Branstad's endorsement. Branstad was coming off a long weekend. Prospective Republican presidential candidates were in town for Iowa congressman Steve King's Freedom Summit, where they jockeyed for likely caucus-goers' support and Branstad's endorsement. Branstad is seen here speaking at the forum . Branstad was inaugurated for a sixth term earlier this month. The 68-year-old will soon become the nation's longest serving governor . The Republican governor advised probable GOP candidates in attendance to visit all 99 of Iowa's counties if they want to win his state's voters in 2016. 'My advice is you skip Iowa at your own peril,' Branstad said, per the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. 'Rudy Giuliani thought that would be a good strategy and it didn’t work,' he said, referencing the former New York City mayor's ill-fated 2008 bid for the GOP nomination. Other speakers at the conference included Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Hewlett Packard executive Carly Fiorina, and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Likely 2016 candidates Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, Rand Paul, the junior senator from Kentucky and Marco Rubio, the junior senator from Florida, skipped the forum. Branstad told reporters on Monday that he'd spoken to Bush recently, however, and warned him not to avoid Iowa altogether if he runs. Bush's father, George H.W., ultimately lost the 1980 presidential election to Ronald Reagan, but he won the Iowa caucuses that year, Branstad recalled. 'The key to Iowa is hard work. It is come here early and often and connecting with Iowans' Branstad said at his press conference this morning at the Iowa Statehouse, according to the Des Moines Register. 'I think some of the speakers did a good job of that on Saturday. I am glad that they are coming and I hope they will come back again and again.'","'Spell was caused by a seasonal illness'; Branstad's office said the 68-year-old had been 'suffering from the effects of a cold for a couple of days'

"It's not just Barbora Zahlavova-Strycova’s name that’s long. In the mind of Caroline Wozniacki, who exited these Championships on Monday, the speed of her play is on the lengthy side as well. Indeed, so agitated was the Dane that she supported calls for a shot clock as a means of tackling slow play between points — a suggestion that came after something of a tantrum on the subject during her fourth-round defeat. The flashpoint came when Wozniacki, a set and a break of serve down, took exception to the time it was taking Zahlavova-Strycova to tie her shoelaces. Dejected: Caroline Wozniacki crashed out in straight sets against Barbora Zahlaova Strycova . Unexpected: Caroline Wozniacki was a shock loss on Monday at Wimbledon . ‘She’s taking a minute between points,’ the 16th seed said to the umpire, who replied: ‘She was tying her shoes.’ But Wozniacki was unimpressed, saying: ‘There’s always something.’ She had calmed down by the time she addressed the press but still called for a measure to address what has become a serious problem in the game. Players in a Grand Slam are given 20  seconds between points, though umpires rarely enforce the rule, and Wozniacki said: ‘I thought she was very slow. But I guess the referee has the time on it. It’s up to the referee or up to the umpire to say if she is or not.’ When asked about a shot clock, she added: ‘I wouldn’t mind. I think that’s fine. You have a clock and it shows exactly how much time you take in between points. ‘If it’s there, it’s great. If it’s not, it’s up to the referee to say if it’s slow or not.’ Of course, gripes over the time between points should not disguise the fact that Wozniacki, formerly the world No 1, was comprehensively outplayed by her unseeded Czech opponent. Or that she failed, once again, to raise her game in the later rounds of a Grand Slam. Surprise package: Barbora Zahlavova Strycova pulled off a stunning victory to beat Caroline Wozniacki . For Zahlavova-Strycova, the world No 43 who was suspended for six months last year after testing positive for a banned stimulant, this run to the quarter-finals marks her best performance at a Slam and a vindication of sorts for not quitting the sport during her ban. She claimed at the time she had not intended to enhance her performance by ingesting the stimulant via a supplement, and the game’s authorities accepted her explanation. But it has, nonetheless, been a difficult journey for the 5ft 4in Czech with the big groundstrokes. ‘I didn’t want to play again because I felt like it was a little bit unfair,’ she said. ‘I was feeling that for about a month (during her ban). I was like, “I don’t want to be here and see the same people every week”. I was empty. I took off and I didn’t focus on  tennis at all. I didn’t follow any results. ‘But then I thought, “Yeah, what am I going to do? I love the sport.” And then I didn’t ask myself any more.’ Tears of joy: Barbora Zahlavova Strycova reacts after her stunning victory . VIDEO Wimbledon: Day seven roundup . Meanwhile, Sabine Lisicki’s mission to exorcise the memories of her collapse in last year’s final continued with a three-set win over Ana Ivanovic in the third round. Ivanovic was booed off on Saturday evening when she refused to play on because of the darkness, with Lisicki 6-4, 1-1 ahead. The Serb returned to take the second set  6-3, but she fell apart in the third, losing 6-1.  Petra Kvitova, the sixth seed and 2011 champion, needed only an hour and one minute to beat Shuai Peng 6-3, 6-2 and reach the quarter-finals for a fifth straight year. She faces fellow Czech Zahlavova-Strycova in the last eight, while Lucie Safarova, a third Czech, is also through after crushing Tereza Smitkova 6-0, 6-2 in 48 minutes.

"A music fan who created an Ed Sheeran parody video using his  goatee to replicate the singer's famous ginger locks has told of his shock after it went super-viral racking up over 22 million hits in just two days. Shaun Solomon says he spent about four minutes making the clip which sees him lip-syncing along to Sheeran's smash hit Thinking Out Loud. His ginger goatee has been  prepared to recreate the singer's trademark hair with two eyes and a nose crudely painted on upside down to complete the effect. Spot the difference: Multi-platinum singer Ed Sheeran and retail manager Saul Soloman's goatee which has racked up an incredible 22 million internet hits in just two days . But Mr Solomon, a retail worker from Northampton, could never have guessed just how popular his singing chin was about to become. After posting the clip on his own YouTube page it was picked up LadBible which placed it on its Facebook page where  it has so far received around nine million hits. It was also posted by the UniLad Facebook page where it has gathered over 13 million  hits. Added to the 180,000 hits on Mr Soloman's YouTube page it means his chin has been watched by well over 22 million people. Mr Solomon said he is amazed by how many people have watched his singing chin and says he'd be in 'big trouble' if he decided to shave . Hitmaker: Ed Sheeran performs on the catwalk during the  Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in London, in December last year . Mr Solomon, 23, said: 'It's amazing how it's exploded. It started as a just a giggle between a few mates. 'I'm a big Ed Sheeran fan and it was either going to be him or Mick Hucknall, so I think we made the right choice. 'It's mad to think that he might have seen it.' 'I've had the goatee for three years and it's got me a bit of stick, but if I shaved it now I'd be in deep trouble.'","Music fan spent four minutes making parody clip that has gone viral .

"Iona Bain is disappointed that PanOxyl has disappeared  from the shops without explanation . As a consumer journalist, I'm always on the hunt for cracking deals so that I can shave a few pounds off my shopping bill. But when it comes to skincare, cost considerations don't apply. I've bought countless expensive lotions and potions, hoping that just one will clear up my complexion. You see, I'm one of millions in the UK who have battled 'acne vulgaris', simply known as acne. This happens when sebaceous glands near the surface of the skin produce too much sebum, or oil, which mixes with dead skin cells. It blocks the hair follicles, tiny holes in the skin, forming blackheads and whiteheads. Nasty pustules and cysts occur when those blocked follicles come into contact with otherwise harmless bacteria on the skin's surface. The condition is believed to affect 80 per cent of those aged between 11 and 30, according to the British Skin Foundation. And it can last into adulthood - I'm 27 in March and still expect breakouts whenever life takes a stressful turn. I have been plagued by pimples since I was 14 but my condition reached ghastly new heights three years ago. When a painful breakout on the side of my neck triggered speculation from a colleague that I was overly fond of love bites, I resolved to find a cure for good. I tried anything and everything. There was high-tech heat therapy, supposed to kill acne-causing bacteria in the skin, as well as French seaweed (known as thalassotherapy). But nothing worked. After spending a small fortune, I finally discovered the miracle - a blackhead-buster that was worth its weight in gold. And it cost £5. That miracle was PanOxyl, an over-the-counter topical gel. Its main ingredient was benzoyl peroxide, widely considered the 'gold standard' in acne treatment. It came to skin specialists' attention in 1963, when Canadian Dr William Pace realised that the ingredient, used to treat infections of hair follicles, was also highly effective for acne. 'It injects air into the pore, helping to remove bacteria, dirt and oil, and is anti-inflammatory,' explains Dr Victor Sagoo of the Solihull Medical Cosmetic Clinic in Warwickshire. It doesn't contain antibiotics, so resistance isn't a problem, adds Dr Neill Hepburn, a dermatologist at Grantham Hospital in Lincolnshire. 'It's simple, safe and effective.' For more than a year she used PanOxyl every week until two years ago she was told it had been discontinued . I started using the white cream an hour before bed each night. It had a strong antiseptic smell and made my skin tingle, but the next day I noticed a reduction in the size and redness of the spots on my neck and jawline, and within two weeks most were gone, with no scarring. For more than a year I used PanOxyl every week - until two years ago I was told it had been discontinued. I found out through social media that the maker of PanOxyl - a U.S.-based GlaxoSmithKline subsidiary called Stiefel - had halted production due to a 'global manufacturing supply issue'. It had been taken off the market, along with other Stiefel acne products. I was devastated, and so were others. Stiefel's Facebook page has been flooded by complaining customers. One of them, Ian Charlesworth, a 32-year-old charity worker from Hackney who had been using PanOxyl for two years, said his breakouts returned instantly when he stopped using it. 'It's a really important product. It would be like Nurofen being pulled from the painkiller market,' he said. Stiefel representatives have told customers on Facebook that the company is 'expediting a solution for [PanOxyl's] production issues'. Glaxo would not tell Good Health which ingredients were in short supply. PanOxyl, an over-the-counter topical gel, cost £5 . On eBay, benzoyl peroxide products are selling for as much as £299 for a small tube. But the British Skin Foundation has urged patients to consult a 'qualified medical professional' rather than buy PanOxyl online. The problem is that effective alternatives to PanOxyl are hard to come by. Only two out of seven pharmacies I visited in Edinburgh and London could recommend a product with benzoyl peroxide. Quinoderm is the nearest equivalent - this contains both benzoyl peroxide and potassium hydroxyquinolone sulphate, which is antibacterial. But this, too, has been temporarily taken off shelves due to concerns about supply of non-EU approved ingredients. As Dr George Moncrieff, an Oxfordshire-based GP, says: 'This means there are no benzoyl peroxide products available over the counter. It's a disaster.' The particular benefit of PanOxyl is that it comes in two strengths of benzoyl peroxide, he adds. The 2.5 per cent formulation, which I used, was perfect for patients with 'milder' acne. There are other benzoyl peroxide remedies such as Duac and Epiduo, but both require a prescription and contain other ingredients which can be problematic. The proportion of women over the age of 25 who develop acne . Duac has 5 per cent benzoyl peroxide, which Dr Moncrieff says can cause dryness, as well as clindamycin phosphate, an antibiotic to which some people may be resistant. Epiduo has 2.5 per cent benzoyl peroxide. Dr Sagoo also notes that both treatments are much more expensive than Panoxyl, costing from around £14. Ian Charlesworth has tried both Duac and Epiduo 'but they made my skin very dry and didn't work'. So why, two years on, has PanOxyl not returned to the shelves? According to a Glaxosmithkline spokesman, PanOxyl 10 per cent Aquagel and PanOxyl 4 per cent Cream were 'returned to the market earlier this year' - though, like me, others have had trouble obtaining these. The spokesman added 'due to strict European regulatory and quality requirements in addition to GSK standards, we were unable to restore other strength formulations at the time'. There are other options, such as the Pill or acne drug Roaccutane, which reduces the action of the oil glands and bacteria that cause acne. But there have been concerns about side-effects - both drugs have been linked to depression and Roaccutane to suicide. Thankfully, my skin has cleared up of its own accord - I decided to stop using products, only splashing my face with water, though I occasionally resort to my last tube of PanOxyl. I still hope that miraculous PanOxyl will soon be back on the shelves.","PanOxyl, an over-the-counter topical gel at £5, was a miracle for many .

"U.S. company Kythera claims to have invented an injection which can banish fat under the chin. James Corden, known to have a double chin, is pictured at the HBO Post Golden Globe Party . A double chin is the dreaded sight faced by many people looking into a mirror. Now, a U.S. company claims to have invented an injection which can banish that chin bulge. ATX-101, an experimental drug made by California-based Kythera Biopharmaceuticals, is injected into the skin over a series of treatments spaced no less than one month apart. The drug is a type of deoxycholic acid - a naturally-occurring molecule that helps the body break down fat, according to Kythera's website. It acts 'immediately on targeted fat cells' but is 'rapidly cleared' from the chin, leaving surrounded tissue largely unaffected, Kythera claims. It says fat under the chin is influenced by ageing and genetics, and can often not be changed by diet and exercise alone. While this area of the face is important to patients, it is undertreated, according to Kythera. ATX-101 not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the body that regulates medicines and cosmetics in the U.S. But in clinical trials the injections were tested on more than 1,600 people, with 90 per cent reporting it reduced the fat under their chin after two years, Kythera said. As part of the trial, ATX-101 was injected up to four or six times, based on the amount and volume of the fat under the chin. However, common side effects included pain in the chin, numbness, bruising, swelling, redness, firmness, itching, a burning or prickling sensation and nodules. While Kythera said these side effects were 'temporary' and 'mild-to-moderate in severity', in previous studies 13 per cent of participants dropped out of the trial due to these  effects. If approved by the FDA ATX-101 will be a 'first-in-class' drug to stop double chins, Kythera said. Other treatments for fat under the skin are invasive, or lack evidence, according to a study on ATX-101 published in the British Journal of Dermatology. ATX-101 is made from a purified synthetic version of deoxycholic acid, a naturally occurring molecule in the body. The molecule aids in the breakdown of dietary fat. It is currently in late stage clinical trials for the reduction of fat under the chin, which commonly presents as a double chin. Treatment with ATX-101 contours the area under the chin by destroying fat cells, while leaving surrounding tissue largely unaffected, it's manufacturers Kythera claim. The destruction of fat cells is followed by a natural healing response that involves clearing away dead cells. Common side effects included pain in the chin, numbness, bruising, swelling, redness, firmness, itching, a burning or prickling sensation and nodules. While Kythera said these side effects were 'temporary' and mild-to-moderate in severity, in previous studies 13 per cent of participants dropped out of the trial due to these side effects. Source: Kythera and NHS Choices . These include a neck lift, known as a platysmaplasty, which is a procedure to lift sagging skin in the neck, or liposuction of the neck and chin. While these procedures are effective, they are expensive and can have long recovery times of up to a year. Liposuction is the most common treatment for fat under the chin but it can result in complications and an unfavourable result, the study said. There is little evidence proving non-surgical treatments work to reduce double chins long term, it added. A 2012 report by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) found that chin surgery grew more than breast augmentation, Botox and liposuction combined in 2011. The procedure skyrocketed in both women and men, as well as in all patients over the age of 20, with the largest increase seen in patients age 40 or older, it said. There were 20,680 procedures in 2011, a 71 per cent increase compared to 2010, making it the fastest growing plastic surgery trend at this time. Dr Malcolm Roth , who was president of the ASPS when this report came out, said: 'The chin and jawline are among the first areas to show signs of aging. People are considering chin augmentation as a way to restore their youthful look just like a facelift or eyelid surgery.' 'We also know that as more people see themselves on video chat technology, they may notice that their jawline is not as sharp as they want it to be. Chin implants can make a dramatic difference.' A 2012 report by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) found cases of chin surgery in the U.S. were rocketing. It was the fastest growing plastic surgery trend in 2011, it said .","U.S. company claims to have invented an injection for double chins .

"Astronomers around the world have been training telescopes on an asteroid and returning images and data as it flies past Earth. At 4.20pm GMT (11.20am EST) asteroid 2004 BL86 made its closest approach to Earth at a distance 3.1 times greater than that of the moon - far too distant to be of any threat. Observers on Earth were able to view the asteroid with binoculars or a telescope  -and Nasa's high powered telescopes revealed it had its own moon. Scroll down for video . The 20 individual images used in the movie were generated from data collected at Goldstone on Jan. 26, 2015. They show the primary body is approximately 1,100 feet (325 meters) across and has a small moon approximately 230 feet (70 meters) across. The images show the asteroid, which made its closest approach today (Jan. 26, 2015) at 8:19 a.m. PST (11:19 a.m. EST) at a distance of about 745,000 miles (1.2 million kilometers, or 3.1 times the distance from Earth to the moon), has its own small moon. The 20 individual images used in the movie were generated from data collected at Goldstone on Jan. 26, 2015. They show the primary body is approximately 1,100 feet (325 meters) across and has a small moon approximately 230 feet (70 meters) across. In the near-Earth population, about 16 percent of asteroids that are about 655 feet (200 meters) or larger are a binary (the primary asteroid with a smaller asteroid moon orbiting it) or even triple systems (two moons). Asteroid 2004 BL86 was initially discovered on 30 January 2004 by a telescope of the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (Linear) survey in White Sands, New Mexico. Astronomers had thought the asteroid was about 1,640ft (500 metres) wide, but new images have revealed it to be smaller at about 980ft (300 metres) across. But, even passing at a distance of 745,000 miles (1.2 million kilometers), Nasa said the asteroid posed absolutely no threat to Earth. This was the closest pass of an asteroid this large until 2027 when another - (137108) 1999 AN10 - passes our planet within one lunar distance. The asteroid will be at its closest point to Earth at 4.20pm GMT (11.20am EST) today. However, observers in the Americas, Europe, and Africa will have the best chance to view it when it is fully illuminated by the sun and at its brightest, at 1.00am GMT tomorrow (8.00pm EST today). During this time 2004 BL86 will be heading northward through the dim constellation Cancer, and should be visible just above Jupiter. It will then skim the eastern edge of a star cluster called the Beehive (or Messier 44) from about 5am GMT tomorrow (midnight EST tonight). The asteroid will continue to be visible until tomorrow night, giving astronomers a rare opportunity to study an object of this type and size. 'The asteroid's close pass will enable ground based radio astronomers to bounce radio waves off the object, to get a much better determination of its overall shape and true size,' astronomer Nick Howes, who works with the Kielder Observatory in Northumberland, told MailOnline. 'This data, combined with that from many ground based visual observations will give us more insights into these near-Earth objects, and hopefully play a part in mitigating the risk of any future ones possibly hitting Earth.' Dr Don Yeomans, who is retiring as manager of Nasa's Near Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, after 16 years in the position, added: 'Monday, January 26 will be the closest asteroid 2004 BL86 will get to Earth for at least the next 200 years. 'And while it poses no threat to Earth for the foreseeable future, it's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid, so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more.' 2004 BL86 made its closest approach to Earth at 4.20pm GMT (11.20am EST). The asteroid passed about 3.1 times the distance of Earth to the moon (illustrated). It is estimated that the asteroid is 980ft (300 metres) in size. Novice stargazers should be able to view it with binoculars or a telescope through today and tomorrow . In a live Slooh webcast, images of the asteroid from Mauna Kea in Hawaii (shown) were also shown. Over the next day it is expected that more images of the asteroid will be returned, revealing new details . One way Nasa scientists plan to learn more about 2004 BL86 is to observe it with microwaves. Nasa's Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone, California, and the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico will attempt to acquire science data and radar-generated images of the asteroid during the days surrounding its closest approach to Earth. 'When we get our radar data back the day after the flyby, we will have the first detailed images,' said radar astronomer Dr Lance Benner of JPL, the principal investigator for the Goldstone radar observations of the asteroid. 'At present, we know almost nothing about the asteroid, so there are bound to be surprises.' At the time of its closest approach on 26 January, the asteroid was approximately 745,000 miles (1.2 million kilometers) from Earth - and it is now moving away from our planet . This image shows the asteroid moving through the night sky on 23 January. The asteroid has a tail in the image due to its fast speed. Astronomers will be hoping for even better views later today . Where to watch: Observers in the Americas, Europe, and Africa have the best seats for seeing the asteroid. It will begin to be visible in the night sky from about 4.20pm GMT (11.20am EST) today, but will be at its brightest at 1.00am GMT tomorrow (8.00pm EST today) when it is fully illuminated by the sun . Almost exactly when it becomes brightest (about 9th magnitude), asteroid 2004 BL86 skirts very close to the Beehive Cluster, M44. During this time 2004 BL86 will be heading northward through the dim constellation Cancer. It will later skim the eastern edge of a star cluster called the Beehive (or Messier 44) The asteroid orbits the Sun every 1.84 years. It was discovered 11 years ago by the Linear telescope in New Mexico, which was designed to hunt for such objects. Despite the asteroid's two close visits then and now, it won't approach Earth again this closely for another 200 years. Astronomers have also assigned this asteroid a permanent number, 357439, but it has not yet been named. Because it's relatively large, 2004 BL86 will brighten rapidly as it approaches and passes Earth. The asteroid will brighten, despite the increasing distance, because we're seeing its face become more fully illuminated. 'One good technique for [finding] fast-movers like 2004 BL86 is to identify and lock onto a star along its path,' explains Kelly Beatty from Sky and Telescope. 'Then just watch at the time that the asteroid is predicted to pass by that particular star.' The asteroid is expected to be observable to amateur astronomers with small telescopes and strong binoculars. 'I may grab my favorite binoculars and give it a shot myself,' said Dr Yeomans. 'Asteroids are something special. Not only did asteroids provide Earth with the building blocks of life and much of its water, but in the future, they will become valuable resources for mineral ores and other vital natural resources. 'They will also become the fueling stops for humanity as we continue to explore our solar system. There is something about asteroids that makes me want to look up.'","2004 BL86 made its closest approach to Earth at 4.20pm GMT (11.20am EST) today .

"New York Police Department detectives have a 50-year-old murder case  on their hands after the medical examiner ruled an elderly Brooklyn man's death to be due to a stabbing from the 1950s. Antonio Ciccarello passed away at the age of 97 in September, more than five decades after being stabbed in the stomach in the Lower East Side on his way to work. The New York Daily News reports the family was shocked when their father turned up in the morgue, instead of a funeral home, with his death ruled a homicide. Death: Antonio Ciccarello died at 97, more than five decades after being stabbed in the stomach in the Lower East Side on his way to work, and the medical examiner has ruled it a murder . 'It was way out of left field for me,' said his daughter Mary Paloglou, 57, who thought the hernia that finally killed her father was caused by strain inflicted on the job as a porter. But the medical examiner said the hernia was lasting damage resulting from  Ciccarello being blindsided with a knife on the streets of New York. Paloglou said she'd heard stories about how her father was stabbed, when she was around three, but had no idea the extent of the attack. In the 1950s, an unknown assailant jumped Ciccarello on the street. He got away from his attacker and went to the hospital after the pain became unbearable, only then learning he'd been stabbed. Doctors left a scar on his stomach after performing an operation on him to fix any internal bleeding the stabbing may have caused. The internal injuries he suffered eventually led to his death half a century later, according to the city medical examiner. Passed away: Ciccarello refused an operation on his hernia last year because he was worried he wouldn't survive the surgery in his advanced age . His daughter said he never reported the attack to police since he didn't know the identity of the perpetrator, and that the person who committed the assault is now likely passed away as well. 'It could of been a bum in the street,' said Paloglou. 'It was just a random act. He wasn't robbed.' Ciccarello refused an operation on the hernia last year because he was worried he wouldn't survive the surgery in his advanced age. 'We were afraid that he was going to die on the table,' said Paloglou.","Antonio Ciccarello died last September from a hernia .

Murdered Crimewatch presenter Jill Dando tried to get BBC bosses to investigate an alleged paedophile ring in the corporation, it has today been claimed . The former staff member, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Daily Star Sunday that she raised the claims with management in the mid 1990s. The source said that the names were 'surprisingly big'. She said: 'I think she was quite shocked when told about images of children and that information on how to join this horrible paedophile ring was freely available.' They added that Ms Dando had also been told that female work colleagues told her they had been groped or assaulted, and that nothing had been done. A former friend and retired BBC worker has claimed that the television host was told that 'big name stars' and BBC staff were involved in abuse . 'She compiled a file of complaints but she was not really an investigative journalist, just a presenter. 'She passed the information to someone else and they gave it back. No one wanted to know.' The BBC said it had not seen anything to substantiate the claims. Miss Dando, 37, was gunned down outside her home in Fulham, west London, on April 26, 1999, moments after stepping out of her car. Dando was killed with a single muffled bullet to the skull and neighbours found her in a pool of blood on her doorstep in a crime that shocked Britain. Part-time stuntman Barry George was jailed for the killing in 2001, but his conviction was overturned in August 2008 following the emergence of fresh evidence. Her killer has never been found.","Retired BBC worker claims that 'big names' were involved in abuse .

"Lord Mandelson warned the party leadership not to demand the resignation of Nick Clegg as the price of joining forces . Ed Miliband should prepare for a Coalition with Nick Clegg, according to Labour heavyweight Peter Mandelson. The former business secretary said the party should not make the same mistake as 2010 when it refused to contemplate having to do a deal with the Lib Dems to stay in power. Lord Mandelson warned the party leadership not to demand the resignation of Mr Clegg as the price of joining forces. The Labour peer said: ‘In 2010 some senior Lib Dems said a precondition of a viable deal with Labour was Gordon Brown’s departure. ‘Gordon did eventually agree to stand aside in the autumn, but I don’t think it would be any more appropriate to say who their leader should be than it was for them to do so in 2010.’ Lord Mandelson also said it was too early to contemplate a deal with the SNP – warning that many in the party would find it too ‘difficult to stomach’. He said: ‘There is talk of a coalition with the SNP, rather than or in addition to the Liberal Democrats – I just think it is far too early to contemplate that, and who knows how they will do on the day.’ The Labour peer insisted that preparing for a Coalition did not mean he thought Mr Miliband was on course to fall short of a majority at the next election. He said it was ‘not defeatist to consider the different scenarios in which we can get the Tories out’. Speaking to the Guardian, he said: ‘Labour has to be careful about two things – it must not appear tribal or exclusive in its politics and it must not repeat its 2010 lack of preparation.’ He added: ‘Ed Miliband is an intelligent and adaptable person. If Labour is ahead on seats I am sure he will want to give it his best shot.’ The former Cabinet heavyweight – the First Secretary of State under Gordon Brown – said Labour and the Lib Dems would be able to iron out its differences. He said: ‘Where there is a will there is a way, but it will be harder to scramble something together at the last moment if there has been no thinking through beforehand.’ Lord Mandelson added: ‘Achieving greater fairness and protecting those most in need would be relatively easy to agree between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, as would the position on Europe, while the harder issues would be reducing the financial deficit and long-term debt. ‘We cannot achieve anything we want without economic growth and policies to achieve that will have to come first. Security against terrorism would also have to be hammered out.’ Lord Mandelson (left) was the First Secretary of State under Gordon Brown and served in the Cabinet with Ed Miliband (right) Mr Miliband should consider how Labour could form a coalition with the Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, said Lord Mandelson . He said Labour under Gordon Brown had failed to prepare properly for Coalition. The peer said: ‘Some of us certainly contemplated beforehand what would happen if we lost our overall majority in 2010, but we did nothing about it, and during the weekend after polling day we had to make up in 48 hours what we had failed to do in the previous three months. ‘No real attempt had been made to get on working terms with the Liberal Democrats. ‘Gordon Brown had good personal relations with Menzies Campbell and Vince Cable, and he talked to them regularly – a relationship that continued in the weekend of talks in 2010. But he was not on the same terms with Nick Clegg. ‘We were rapidly trying to make up for lost time. Gordon asked me to lead the Labour coalition talks [and] though I doubted the post-election arithmetic would add up I gave it all we had. ‘But it was all too makeshift. If we had been serious the talking should have started long before, as I suspected it had informally between the Liberal Democrats and the Tories. For them, the chemistry fell into place quite quickly. We were fighting a losing battle.’","Mandelson warned Labour not to demand resignation of Nick Clegg .

Gonzalez, an Iraq army veteran with a knife in his pants, scaled the fence from the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it inside. He overpowered an officer at the entrance and ran through most of the main floor and made it to the East Room before he was finally captured. The shocking security breach  launched congressional hearings and led to Secret Service director Julie Pierson's resignation. Just 24 hours later college student Kevin Carr was arrested for trespassing after he parked his car at a security checkpoint outside the estate and refused to leave. And in the same month a man wearing a Pikachu hat and carrying a plush doll of the Pokemon jumped the fence and walked on to the North Lawn. August 2014: The White House went on lockdown after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates. May 2014: A man was arrested for indecent exposure after stripping off all his clothes when he was denied access outside the White House.

"Terror: Baghdad Meziane was convicted of funding Al Qaeda but cannot be deported from Britain because of the Human Rights Act . A convicted terrorist who cannot be deported from the UK once ran off with £40,000 belonging to his British wife, it has been claimed. Baghdad Meziane, who is linked to the jihadists responsible for the Paris terror attacks, was married to an English woman for 12 years and lived with her in London. But when the relationship went sour, he transferred thousands of pounds from their joint funds into an Algerian bank account and promptly absconded, according to his former in-laws. Soon after splitting from his wife Meziane, 50, was convicted of helping to finance Al Qaeda and sentenced to 11 years in prison. But last week it emerged that the Home Office is unable to send him back to Algeria because he claims he has a right to a family life with his new wife and their two children in Leicester. Meziane, who holds British as well as Algerian citizenship, is a close associate of Djamel Beghal, mentor to two of the terrorists who attacked Paris earlier this month. He married his first wife Rachel Whitcombe in 1989 when he needed a British passport, according to The Sun. The couple - who were childless - owned a home in Leytonstone, east London, but they sold the property when they split up in 2001. They were planning to share the £40,000 profit - but Meziane took the whole amount and transferred it into a bank account in Algeria. His former sister-in-law, Anna Whitcombe, said she feared that he might have used the money to fund terrorism. Fraud: Meziane used this fake French passport as part of a plot to support Al Qaeda's terrorism . 'He promised to give her half back and he never did, we obviously assumed that was what it was for,' she told The Sun. 'Looking back she thinks she was a bit blind. He must have been leading a double life.' She added that Meziane did not seem to be a devout Muslim during his marriage - he never prayed and regularly drank alcohol. But he was jailed in 2003 after being found guilty of 'entering into a funding arrangement for the purposes of terrorism' - using credit card fraud to raise money which was then passed on to Al Qaeda extremists. Meziane also collaborated with another jihadist, Brahim Benmerzouga, to secure military equipment and fake travel documents for the use of terrorists. Close: Meziane had links to Al Qaeda recruiter and convicted terrorist Djamel Beghal, pictured, who is said to have radicalised kosher supermarket killer Amedy Coulibaly and Charlie Hebdo gunman Chérif Kouachi . After leaving prison in 2009, he re-married and had two children, while his first wife has now moved abroad. A Home Office source claimed last week that efforts to deport Meziane are under way, but he has used the Human Rights Act to stay in the country. His ally Beghal converted Amedy Coulibaly, who killed four hostages in a kosher supermarket in Paris, to radical Islam when the pair were in prison together. Beghal is also linked to Cherif Kouachi, one of the two brothers who murdered 11 people in the attack on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.","Baghdad Meziane, 50, was married to Brit Rachel Whitcombe for 12 years .

"Alexis Tsipras may have been described as the ‘Greek Che Guevara’ but many believe 'Betty' – the new Greek Prime Minister's partner for 20 years – is the true radical. Peristera Batziana, who is the mother of his two children, encouraged the 40-year-old to enter politics when he was apparently more into sport. They were fellow engineering students and Miss Batziana convinced him to join the Communist Youth of Greece in 1990 despite his middle-class background. Scroll down for video . Power couple: Peristera 'Betty' Batziana convinced Greece's new Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to join the Communist Youth of Greece in 1990 after they had met three years earlier at high school in Athens . Publicity-shy: The couple, who graduated from university as engineers, are rarely seen together in public . Within a year, they were leading a revolt in Athens against unpopular education reforms. The new Prime Minister has deliberately kept his family out of the limelight as he led his anti-austerity Syriza party into power. But many believe the strong willed Betty, who has been at his side for more than 20 years, may become the power behind the throne. Mr Tsipras was born into a bourgeois family and before meeting Miss Batziana was more interested in sports than politics. Then a knee injury kept him out of sport. That coincided with him meeting Miss Batziana, a fellow student who convinced him to join the Communist Youth of Greece in 1990. A year later, when the students of Athens revolted against unpopular education reforms, the pair, as leaders of the movement, led protests at the Ampelokipoi Branch High School. Changing direction: A knee injury kept Mr Tsipras out of sport at the same time as he met Miss Batziana, a fellow student who convinced him to join the Communist Youth of Greece in 1990 . Couple: Mr Tsipras and Ms Batziana got together in 1987 when they were at high school together in Athens . Pupils ate and slept at the school and Mr Tsipras told an interviewer at the time: ‘We want the right to judge for ourselves whether to skip class.’ They both went on to attend the National Technical University of Athens and became engineers. According to friends from the University of Patras, where Miss Batziana graduated in electrical engineering, she is strong-willed, militant and dynamic. She once took one of her professors to court when he tried undermine her work on a doctoral thesis, it was reported by the Greek Reporter. She also hates spending hours shopping and doesn’t like going for regular trips to the hairdresser. Miss Batziana avoids the media spotlight and the couple have made very few public appearances. They live in a flat in a seven-storey apartment block in Kypseli - a modest, working-class area of Athens. Humble: The ramshackle block of flats where Tsipras and his partner, Betty Batziana, an electrical and computer engineer, live with their two children in one of the most densely populated areas of Athens . New home: The couple will now have to get used to the opulent surroundings of the Maximos Mansion . Wave: New Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on the steps of the century-old official residence in Athens . Once a brash motorbike-riding Communist activist, Mr Tsipras preferred to take advantage of the cohabitation law that has been in effect since 2009 rather than get married at the courthouse or the church. The unconventional political leader - regarded as a true man of the people – takes out the rubbish, is an avid football fan and puts their boys, Phoebus and Orpheus, to bed. His youngest son’s middle name is Ernesto – a tribute to Che Guevara, one of his idols. There will be one major change, as the family swaps their modest working-class home for Athens' Prime Ministerial palace. With its grand portico and white marble columns, the opulent Maximos Mansion has been the official residence of Greek Prime Ministers since 1982. It could be a culture shock for a leader who has lived so far as a man of the people. Avoiding the perks of political life, Mr Tsipras still opts to get around on a motorbike, flies economy and has never been seen wearing a tie. In the weeks before Sunday’s momentous election, the question of whether he would opt to wear a tie as Prime Minister was widely asked. Invariably Mr Tsipras replied no, ‘After all,’ he joked ‘I didn’t wear one to see the Pope.’ Right behind her man: Mr Tsipras, followed by his partner Peristera (Betty) Batziana, greets his  supporters outside Syriza's headquarters after his party's win in Sunday's general election .

"Ex-PM Tony Blair received a briefing about UFOs from the Ministry of Defence because of his concerns over the disclosure of classified information on extraterrestrials . Former prime minister Tony Blair received a briefing about UFOs from the Ministry of Defence because of his concerns over the disclosure of classified information on alien life-forms. Downing Street requested the advice for the PM in 1998 as the Freedom of Information Act was being introduced, which allowed the public to obtain information on alien mysteries. Mr Blair's concerns were raised after he received a letter from a member of the public referring to a 'cover-up' and asking him to make UFO reports and other information available. According to The Daily Telegraph, Mr Blair sought advice from the MOD for their policy on the issue. He was told by staff at the ministry that it has 'only a limited interest in UFO matters' but that they ' remained open-minded' about 'extraterrestrial life forms'. Details of the briefing emerged yesterday ahead of today's release of files by the Government of more than 6,700 pages  detailing seemingly close encounters with UFOs over the last 30 years. Among a series of UFO sightings in the files is a  policeman's report of a mystery cluster of lights darting across the sky during an FA Cup replay between Chelsea and Manchester United. The mounted officer’s claims to have seen the bright object hovering over Stamford Bridge in March 1999 for almost 15 seconds, slowly changing shape, were corroborated by a colleague. The ‘credible witness report’ is one of a series investigated by the Ministry of Defence, whose top-secret files are being released in sections by the National Archives following the closure of the ministry’s UFO desk in 2009.

"An entire Scottish island has gone up for sale for £350,000 - less than half the price of a one-bedroom flat in central London. Holm of Huip - one of the smaller of the Orkney Islands which lie 10 miles north of the Scottish mainland - boasts 62 acres of land, picturesque beaches and its own pod of seals. But the drawbacks to any potential owner are that the island is only accessible by boat or helicopter and has no electricity, running water or habitable buildings. Scroll down for video . The Orkney Island of Holm of Huip has gone up for sale for £350,000 - for which a buyer will get 62 acres of beautiful Scottish coastline . The tiny island, which has not been inhabited for a century, boasts a number of picturesque beaches and its own pod of seals . There are no buildings on the island and rules mean the potential buyer may only be allowed to live there for three months in the summer . Holm of Huip lies just off the coast of Stronsay, a better-known Orkney island which has a population of around 350. Sellers Vladi Private Islands, have listed the island for sale for around £350,000 - more than £400,000 lower than the average one-bed property in inner London. The seals and the ruins of a stone house  are all that remains on the island, which is formed from old red sandstone. If an interested party were to buy the island, it would be lived-on for the first time in more than 100 years, although there are legal barriers restricting anyone from living there permanently, with short stays of up to three months in the summer generally permitted. Pedro Arez, director ofVladi Private Islands, said: 'The area was thought to be occupied by Vikings and is known to have a number of archaeological sites containing artefacts which are centuries old.' The 250,000 square-metre island was bought by a German family who were interested in its history and is also used by local fisherman . The ruins of a  house are the only signs of civilisation on the island - which was once used by the Vikings and is of archaeological interest . Mr Arez added: 'A German family bought the island from me because they were so interested in its rich history. 'The remains of Viking longboats and cairn have been discovered up and down the island, usually by local fishermen. The island has been uninhabited for more than 100 years, with the only remaining building the ruins of an old stone house. 'Due to Scottish property laws, permanent living could be problem, but the eventual owner would be free to use the island as a home away from home in the summer.' According to the latest Right Move price index, the average price for a property in inner London is £755,655 as of January 2015 - more than two times the asking price of Holm of Huip. Moss-covered dry stone walls and a few wire fences are among the few remnants of the islands former inhabitants . Despite being only accessible by helicopter or boat in good weather, the islands boasts stunning views of the surrounding coastline . The seller of the island says Holm of Huip would make a perfect summer getaway for any potential owner because of its remote location . According to the latest Right Move price index, the average price for a property in inner London is £755,655 as of January 2015 - more than twice the price of Holm of Huip.

The kitchen comes with a fitted dishwasher, cooker, induction hob, built-in fridge with freezer compartment and washer dryer . Unlike the sprawling island, the second-floor flat is just 523 square feet in size, with three windows on to the busy road outside. While it is a fraction of the size of the Holm of Huip, the flat is more accessible, being just five minutes from both the City of London and the West End. This one-bedroom, 523-square-foot flat in central London is on the market for £740,000 - more than twice the price of the Scottish island .

"The mother of a mentally ill 16-year-old girl who was held in a police cell for two days due to a lack of hospital beds claims she suffered heartbreaking failings in her care. The unnamed teenager was arrested in November at Torbay Hospital, in Devon, for an alleged breach of peace and later sectioned. But she spent two days in a cell at Torquay police station because no mental health beds were available.

'When I walked in and saw her lying there, on that floor... heartbreaking,' she said. 'She was on a blue thing on the floor - it's not even what you class as a police bed. 'She needed the right help. 'The police, I can't fault them, they did an amazing job looking after my child.' More than 24 hours after the girl was put in the cell, Paul Netherton, Assistant Chief Constable at Devon and Cornwall Police, tweeted his frustration at the situation. He wrote: 'We have a 16yr old girl suffering from mental health issues held in police custody.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was 'totally unacceptable for someone with severe mental health problems to be placed in a police cell' His comments provoked a national debate and questions in Parliament. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was 'totally unacceptable for someone with severe mental health problems to be placed in a police cell'. The girl was arrested at Torbay Hospital for an alleged breach of peace, and was then taken to Torquay police station where she was sectioned under the Mental Health Act the following morning. She was never charged with any offence. Once someone is sectioned under the act, it is the responsibility of the NHS to find a place in a specialist hospital where appropriate care can be provided. As no bed was made available, the girl had to remain in a police cell until Saturday evening. However, Exeter Labour MP Ben Bradshaw has claimed a bed was available, but the private provider declined the referral. NHS England would not comment on the specific case, but said providers 'sometimes decline to accept referrals if they feel they cannot meet the individual's needs'. The girl's mother praised the intervention of Mr Netherton and said that evening - two days after the teenager was first placed in the cell - a bed on an adult psychiatric ward was found. 'My daughter shouldn't have been held in a police cell for that long,' she added. Following the case, the government announced the use of police cells as a 'place of safety' for teenagers experiencing mental health problems would be banned. Home Secretary Theresa May said: 'There is no place for this in our society' In a joint statement, the South Devon and Torbay Clinical Commissioning Group, NHS England and Torbay and Southern Devon Health and Care NHS Trust, said the care was 'unacceptable and we apologise'. 'Following a review of this case, we have agreed a system to ensure that, in any case where a child cannot be found an appropriate placement rapidly, a clear escalation process will be followed,' the statement added. However, the mother said she was yet to receive an apology from the NHS. The girl has now been moved to a specialist hospital more than 200 miles (320km) from her family home. 'My daughter needs her family. We need her, she needs us. We are a close family and we don't cope without each other,' her mother added. 'The fact she's so far away from all of us hurts her even more.' Following the case, the government announced the use of police cells as a 'place of safety' for teenagers experiencing mental health problems would be banned.

"China publicly intervened for the first time in America’s looming debt crisis yesterday, demanding the US take 'concrete measures' to prevent a default on government debt that could be globally catastrophic. China is the U.S’s biggest foreign creditor, holding at least £794 billion in US Treasury bonds, and its leaders warned Washington against jeopardising its huge stake in the American economy. Expressing concern over the continuing deadlock in Washington about raising the government’s debt ceiling, China’s vice finance minister, Zhu Guangyao, said the 'clock was ticking' for the U.S. As the world’s two biggest economies, 'China and the US are inseparable,' he said. Scroll down for video . China warned the U.S. about the potential global financial fallout of the deadlock. File picture . Referring to a similar Washington impasse in 2011 that led to the humiliating downgrading of America’s credit rating, Mr Zhu said: 'We hope the United States fully understands the lessons of history.' The U.S. has until October 17th to agree to raise its debt ceiling or the Treasury will run out of money to pay what it owes. Shares on Wall Street and in Europe continued to fall yesterday as the US government headed into a second week of a partial shutdown with no signs of any agreement over the budget. The White House reiterated that President Barack Obama will not negotiate with the Republicans over the threat of a debt default, the first in U.S. history. Aides say Mr Obama believes that negotiating will set a dangerous precedent for future debt ceiling talks. Protestors holds signs against the government shutdown on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol building . Yesterday, Mr Obama said he believed Congress would vote both to reopen government and to raise the debt limit if they did it now. 'My very strong suspicion is there are enough votes there' to pass legislation, he said. 'Hold a vote. Call a vote right now. Let’s see what happens.' However, the Republicans control the House of Representatives. And Republican House Speaker John Boehner vowed on Sunday not to raise the U.S. debt ceiling without a 'serious conversation' about what is driving the debt. With tensions rising in Congress, Democrats countered that their opponents are being irresponsible and reckless to raise the possibility of the US defaulting. The chances of a deal are further hampered by the increasingly venomous war of words between the two main leaders in Congress - Mr Boehner and Democrat Senate leader Harry Reid. The gathering storm: Shares fell as Obama reiterated he would not negotiate with the Republicans . Yesterday, a spokesman for Mr Reid accused Mr Boehner of 'refusing to come to grips with reality' and saying 'things that fly in the face of facts'. White House economic chief Gene Sperling has suggested that Washington could buy some more time to reach a deal if Congress approved a bill to boost the debt ceiling for a few weeks. Conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives have been accused of holding the U.S. to ransom by resisting a deal to keep funding the government unless Mr Obama agrees to delay his healthcare reforms. Many Republicans want a similar condition, as well as others to cut the huge US deficit, placed on raising the debt ceiling. The two parties faced off over the same issue two years ago, agreeing only to a last-minute deal after pressure from the financial markets. Mr Obama has already appealed to Wall Street to force the hand of the Republicans once again. But investors are hardly reassured. Shares on European markets fell to a four-month low on Monday with those on Wall Street tumbling even lower.","China is America's biggest creditor and warned against financial peril .

"Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky died penniless and £300m in debt, including £46m owed to HMRC . Boris Berezovsky, once known as Russia's second richest man, died penniless and in debt, including owing the taxman £46million. The former tycoon, an outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin, was worth an estimated £1.9 billion. But after he was found dead it was revealed Berezovsky died penniless and with debts of more than £300million - including £46million owed to the British taxman. Sitting at the High Court, Mr Justice Morgan said his estate was insolvent. He said because Mr Berezovsky was a debtor unable to pay his debts, his estate became the debtor and was now insolvent. The next stage of the process would be a creditors' meeting. Accountants Grant Thornton were appointed to handle most of the administration of the estate and told the court that HM Revenue and Customs officials had calculated that the estate had a tax debt of £46 million. The 67-year-old one time billionaire was found hanged at his ex-wife's £20million home in Ascot in Berkshire in March 2013. His family do not believe he killed himself and last year a coroner recorded an open verdict into his death. His death has been shrouded in mystery, with his daughter previously claiming the Russian government could be responsible and last year Alexander Lukashenko, the leader of Belarus, claimed he did not believe the Russian oligarch was actually dead. Probate records reveal that he died without a will and left an estate valued at 'nil' in England and Wales. Scroll down for video . In May 2014 another High Court judge had analysed litigation involving the estate and Mr Berezovsky's former partner Elena Gorbunova. Ms Gorbunova had become embroiled in a High Court battle with Mr Berezovsky in late 2012 - after complaining that she had not been given millions he had promised. And Mr Justice Mann had been told - at a High Court hearing in London in May - that following Mr Berezovsky's death Ms Gorbunova had claimed an interest in two French properties. Berezovsky was was found dead  at his ex-wife's £20 million home in Ascot, Berkshire (entrance pictured) Mr Justice Mann had heard that ownership of the properties - one a chateau - lay within a 'corporate structure'. The judge had said it appeared that Mr Berezovsky had not asserted a 'directly-held' interest but possibly a 'beneficial' interest as a trustee. He had heard that an application had been made for permission to sell the properties and lawyers for Ms Gorbunova said an agreement had been reached with some companies involved in the corporate ownership structure. The former tycoon (left), also known as Platon Elenin, lost a multi-billion pound London High Court battle with Roman Abramovich (right), the Chelsea football club owner, just seven months before his death . Ms Gorbunova and Mr Berezovsky had two children and she had been his partner until 2012, Mr Justice Mann had been told. Mr Berezovsky had also previously lost a multi-billion pound High Court fight with Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich in 2012. Just seven months before his death, a judge dismissed a series of claims he made against Mr Abramovich. He lost a £1.8billion damages claim over rightful ownership of the oil group Sibneft and was also left with an estimated £100million legal bill in the aftermath of the case. HMRC declined to comment on how the money would be repaid or if it would have to be written off.","Boris Berezovsky was once Russia's second richest man, worth £1.9 billion .

"The first woman bishop in the history of the Church of England was today officially consecrated - but the ceremony at York Minster was disrupted by a protesting vicar. The Reverend Libby Lane became the Bishop of Stockport in a service conducted by the Archbishop of York, John Sentamu. The historic event was briefly interrupted by the appearance of an ultra-conservative priest, Rev Paul Williamson, shouting 'Not in the Bible' as she was presented to the congregation. Joy: Rev Libby Lane with the Archbishop of York after being consecrated as Bishop of Stockport . Rev Paul Williamson, an outspoken opponent of women in the church, heckled the ceremony . Rev Williamson interrupted the ceremony by shouting 'Not in the Bible'. A Church of England spokesman said his attempt to disrupt the ceremony was 'expected' Disruption: Rev Paul Williamson, circled, shouted 'Not in the Bible' during the consecration service . Historic: Mrs Lane, centre, entering York Minster for a service consecrating her as Bishop of Stockport . First: Rev Libby Lane today became a bishop in the Church of England, overturning five centuries of tradition . A  Church of England spokesman described him as a 'serial protester' who had been expected to attend. He said: 'He's got the right to protest but the contrast was between a lone voice protesting and a sea of voices affirming.' Rev Williamson, priest in charge at St George’s Church, Hanwell, London, has previously mounted several legal challenges against women in the church. Mrs Lane, an Oxford-educated mother of two, was appointed as a bishop last month, in a historic move which ends five centuries of all-male leadership in the church. That announcement came just weeks after the General Synod formally adopted legislation allowing women to take the role, following years of furious debate on the issue. Emerging: Mrs Lane comes out of the church after being officially consecrated as a bishop . Gathered together: Mrs Lane with the Archbishops of York and Canterbury after the service . Congratulations: The new bishop hugs another priest during the ceremony . At today's service - described by the new bishop as 'an occasion of prayer and of party' - Mrs Lane, 48, was greeted by the ringing bells of the medieval Minster as a congregation of 2,000 awaited her arrival. She entered the cathedral through the south door in a procession with other ministers and members of the clergy. The Archbishop of York introduced the service and welcomed Mrs Lane and her family before she was presented to be ordained and consecrated by the Bishops of Exeter and Chester. She spoke to affirm her faith and swore oaths of allegiance and canonical obedience, followed by hymns, Bible readings and psalms. As Dr Sentamu asked the congregation if they wanted Ms Lane to be ordained, Mr Williamson stepped forward to the altar and shouted: 'No. Not in the Bible,' demanding to speak to the prelate. Support: The Archbishop of York, John Sentamu, gives a thumbs-up sign outside the cathedral . Shepherd: Mrs Lane with other female priests outside York Minster following the service . Archbishop: Dr Sentamu, centre, oversaw the service which was attended by 2,000 people . The Archbishop read out a pre-prepared legal statement then repeated his question, 'Is it now your will that she should be ordained?' The congregation replied, 'It is,' and the service continued despite the disruption. After the litany and an ordination prayer, Rev Lane knelt before the Archbishop while he and 100 other bishops present laid their hands on her head. Dr Sentamu presented the new bishop with a Bible and anointed her head. The congregation applauded as she was officially presented as the Bishop of Stockport. Mr Williamson, the vicar of St George's, Hanworth in south-west London, is a well-known campaigner against female priests who tried to launch a lawsuit stopped Prince Charles from marrying Camilla Parker Bowles. Unprecedented: Mrs Lane is the first woman ever to become a bishop in the Church of England . Service: The new bishop looks straight ahead during the service of her consecration . Procession: Dozens of church officials attended the service at York Minster today . Speaking after her consecration, Mrs Lane said: 'Archbishop Sentamu has observed, ""The way that we show our faith and our love for one another is with two simple things, prayer and parties."" 'Today is an occasion of prayer and of party and I am thrilled that so many want to share in both. 'I cannot properly express how encouraged I have been in the weeks since the announcement of my nomination, by the thousands of messages I have received with words of congratulation, support and wisdom. 'Thank you to all who are praying for me and partying with me today.' The bishop added: 'I cannot possibly live up to everyone's expectation. And so today, at my consecration, I hold on to words of promise from the Bible, a reassurance that all this does not depend on me. 'My consecration service is not really about me. With echoes of practice which has been in place for hundreds of years in the church, it is a reminder that what I am about to embark on is shared by the bishops around me, by those who have gone before me and those who will come after.' Authority: The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby was in York today for Mrs Lane's consecration . Embrace: Kate Bottley, a priest who features in TV's Gogglebox, greets Bishop of Manchester David Walker . Excitement: Two members of the clergy run into York Minster ahead of the service . On duty: TV presenter Adrian Chiles, who was sacked as ITV's football anchor last week, was in attendance . At the time of her appointment, Mrs Lane said it was a 'great honour' to be the first female bishop - but insisted that she would not simply be a token face. 'This moment is significant, but it is not simply a gesture,' she said. 'I'm the first, but I won't be the only. 'And I follow in the footsteps of women across the Anglican Church and globally.' The announcement prompted fears that it could lead to a split in the Anglican community, as traditionalists have long fought against the prospect of women becoming bishops. However, Mrs Lane said she wanted to 'heal and not to hurt, to build up and not to destroy'. Capturing the moment: A priest takes a photograph as he waits for the start of the ceremony . Service: Many of those attending were dressed in their formal ecclesiastical vestments . Her husband George is also a reverend, while the couple have two children - Connie, 20, and Benedict, 18. Mrs Lane, originally from the Peak District, was already a pioneer as one of the first female priests in the Church of England, having been ordained in July 1994 after studying theology at St Peter's College, Oxford. Her last job was as vicar of St Peter's, Hale and St Elizabeth's, Ashley - both in the North-West - and she was appointed to her new post after initially serving on the committee trying to find a bishop. In her spare time she is an avid Manchester United supporter who has learned to play the saxophone and enjoys solving cryptic crosswords. Rev Lane said she was excited by the possibilities . Rev Libby Lane comes from an Anglican, but not particularly church-going, family. She became interested in the church after attending a small Anglican church community in rural Derbyshire. Rev Lane studied theology at St Peter's College, Oxford, where she met her husband and trained for the ministry at Cranmer Hall, Durham. The 48-year-old was ordained as a deacon in 1993 and a priest in 1994 - the first year that women were ordained into the priesthood. Mrs Lane was ordained with her husband and they were one of the first married couples to do so. She has held a number of roles in the north of England in the dioceses of Blackburn, York and Chester. She was team Vicar in the Stockport South West Team and Assistant Diocesan Director of Ordinands in the Diocese of Chester. Rev Lane has been vicar at Hale in Greater Manchester and Ashley in Cheshire since 2007. She is married to the Rev George Lane, coordinating chaplain at Manchester Airport. They were one of the first married couples in the Church of England to be ordained together. The couple have two children, Connie, 20, and Benedict, 18. Her interests include being a school governor, encouraging social action initiatives, learning to play the saxophone, supporting Manchester United, reading and doing cryptic crosswords. Mrs Lane was originally part of a committee tasked to find a candidate for the bishopric but was invited to apply herself following the vote in the Synod last month. Her position at the Bishop of Stockport makes her an assistant in the Chester Diocese. But because the post is fairly junior she will not be allowed to sit in the House of Lords.","Rev Libby Lane, 48, was today consecrated as the Bishop of Stockport .

"A pilot whose plane was running dangerously low on fuel used the aircraft's parachute system to ditch the plane in the Pacific off Hawaii on Sunday. The man's landing was all caught on camera - as well as the moment he was plucked to safety by rescuers out of the water. Coast Guard video shows the plane releasing its parachute and briefly dropping nose-first before leveling out and plopping into the sea. The pilot escapes out the top of the aircraft and drifts away in a small raft from the plane before it rolls over on its top. Trouble: The pilot traveling from Tracy, California, to Maui radioed authorities of plans to ditch at 12:30:pm because of dwindling fuel . Heading down: The plane makes toward the water - 253 miles off of Hawaii . Pilot: The man used the plane's parachute system and landed in the water . Maneuver: The Coast Guard directed the pilot to put down near a cruise ship called the Veendam . Recovery: The pilot is seen peering out after his plane landed in the water . The pilot safely landed in the water after being in contact with the US Coast Guard . Adrift: The pilot lies in his life boat after he managed to ditch the Cirrus SR-22 in the water . The cruise ship then plucked the pilot to safety unhurt shortly before 5:30pm, the Coast Guard said . Danger: The pilot only had about three hours' worth of fuel when he made the ditch . Later that day, four people on a different plane were rescued after they, too, had to ditch their plane. The Coast Guard says the separate incidents Sunday involved a Cirrus SR-22 plane carrying a solo pilot 253 miles off the island of Maui, and a Cessna with four people aboard just a few miles off the island of Oahu. In the first incident, a pilot traveling from Tracy, California, to Maui radioed authorities at 12:30 p.m. about plans to ditch a Cirrus SR-22 aircraft because of dwindling fuel - only about three hours' worth. The Coast Guard directed the plane to go down near a cruise ship called the Veendam. 'At approximately 4:44 p.m. the pilot was able to deploy the aircraft’s airframe parachute system and safely exit the aircraft into a life raft,' the Coast Guard said in a release. 'The pretty unique thing about about a Cirrus is that the aircraft itself has a parachute on board,' co-pilot Lt. JG. Michael Carman told KHON. 'So the aircraft orbited and when they were 5,000 feet above the water, slightly in front of the cruise ship, they deployed their parachute.' Amid 9- to 12-foot seas and winds of 25 to 28 mph, the cruise-ship crew rescued the pilot, who was in good condition, authorities said. Later Sunday, the single-engine Cessna plane with four aboard ditched 11 miles off shore. The Coast Guard said in a release 'At 6:18 p.m., the pilot contacted the Hawaii Control Facility at Honolulu International Airport and declared and in flight emergency 30 miles west of Oahu. The pilot reported the aircraft was running out of fuel and that the aircraft may have to ditch. 'At 6:27 p.m., the aircraft disappeared from radar and lost communications.' A Coast Guard helicopter hoisted the three adults and one child. KHON reported there was a 22-year-old woman, a 24-year-old man, a 37-year-old man and a 1-year-old girl on the plane, and listed their conditions as stable. Lt. Commander Clay Cary told the affiliate station 'We searched for a little bit and were able to locate a light in the water, that’s the only thing we saw, we didn't see any wreckage right away. 'So we came down into a hover and found the light was attached to a life jacket down there and when we looked a little closer we saw we had survivors in the water.' Petty Ofc. Donnie Walker told KHON 'Seeing the small child and how small and in fact and in - young it was was emotional, but you just get it done and get 'em out of there, you know, so it's over for them.' Officials say all four were treated for undisclosed injuries. The plane was flying from Kauai to Oahu. Second rescue: Later Sunday, the single-engine Cessna plane with four aboard ditched 11 miles off shore . Treatment: Officials say all four of the rescued plane's passengers were treated for undisclosed injuries . Survival: A Coast Guard helicopter hoisted the three adults and one child to safety after their Cessna plane was extremely low on fuel on Sunday .

"Joan Rivers's daughter has filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit against the New York-based endoscopy clinic where the beloved comedian fell into a coma just days before her death, it  today emerged. In a statement, Melissa Rivers's lawyer announced she is suing Yorkville Endoscopy in Manhattan, where her mother suffered a fatal complication during routine throat surgery on August 28, 2014. The 47-year-old TV producer is also suing the doctors who treated Rivers prior to her death aged 81 on September 4, claiming their 'negligence' and 'carelessness' triggered the star's fatal coma. She explained that the lawsuit stems from her 'unwavering belief' that no-one should have to suffer the high levels of 'medical mismanagement, incompetency and disrespect' that her mother did. 'Not only did my mother deserve better, every patient deserves better,' said Melissa. Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Joan Rivers's daughter Melissa (pictured with her mother in 2005) has filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit against the New York-based endoscopy clinic where the comedian fell into a coma before her death . Rivers, who rose to fame on The Tonight Show, died of brain damage due to lack of oxygen after she stopped breathing during what was meant to be a simple endoscopy and throat exam at the clinic. In the lawsuit, her daughter alleges that doctors did not only carry out those procedures, but also conducted an unauthorized exam of her vocal chords and windpipe, leading to a laryngospasm. During the spasm, Rivers's throat seized up and deprived her brain of oxygen so she could not expel carbon dioxide from her lungs, the suit, filed in Manhattan Supreme Court on Monday, states. But despite the star's vital signs showing clear symptoms of distress, doctors decided to continue with the laryngoscopy, causing Rivers to ultimately suffer a heart attack and brain damage, it adds. Clinic: In a statement, Melissa Rivers's lawyer announced she is suing Yorkville Endoscopy (pictured) in Manhattan, where her mother suffered a fatal complication during routine throat surgery on August 28 . Suing: The 47-year-old television producer is also suing the doctors who treated Rivers prior to her death aged 81 on September 4, claiming their negligence triggered the star's fatal coma. Above, a photo of the lawsuit . The suit goes on to claim that although doctors tried to revive the comedian for around 20 minutes, no-one performed a trachetomy to open up her airways, the New York Daily News reported. 'Had doctors acted as physicians for Joan Rivers instead of groupies, Joan Rivers would have been doing ‘Fashion Police’ last week,' one family lawyer, Jeffrey Bloom, told the newspaper. Instead, Rivers was rushed to nearby Mout Sinai hospital in a coma, where she was put on life support. However, she never regained consciousness and passed away a week later, . The complaint names five doctors - as well as the clinic on East 93rd Street - as defendants. 'Negligent': Melissa explained that the lawsuit (part of which is pictured above) stems from her 'unwavering belief' that no-one should have to suffer the levels of 'medical mismanagement' that her mother did . Accused: One of the doctors the suit refers to is River's private doctor, ENT specialist Gwen Korovin (right), who 'was permitted to do an unauthorized biopsy on Rivers by medical director, Lawrence Cohen (left)' One of the doctors it refers to is River's private doctor, celebrity ENT specialist Gwen Korovin, who was 'permitted to do the unauthorized biopsy by the clinic's medical director, Lawrence Cohen'. At the time, Korovin wasn't cleared to work at the clinic, it states, adding that Cohen 'failed to mention' the procedures carried out by by the doctor and even the fact that she was in the room. Experts told the Post that Melissa could win millions of dollars in the suit because her mother was still making good money from stand-up gigs, books and TV shows in the weeks before her death. Indeed, the comedian performed at a Manhattan club the night before she fell into a coma. She had arranged the throat procedure because her voice had turned raspy and she did not know the cause. 'Unauthorized biopsy': This section of the lawsuit shows some of the allegations against Cohen and Korovin . Celebrity: Experts said Melissa could win millions of dollars in the suit because her mother (pictured on Celebrity Apprentice) was still making good money from stand-up gigs, books and TV shows  before her death . The lawsuit comes just two weeks after it was revealed that Yorkville Endoscopy has lost its federal accreditation and will stop receiving funds at the end of January. In a letter sent to the clinic, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told the clinic it no longer meets their conditions for coverage after failing to identify Rivers's deteriorating vital signs. 'Therefore, CMS is terminating the Medicare Health Benefits Agreement between Yorkville Endoscopy and the Secretary, effective January 31, 2015,' it said on January 12. 'As of January 31, 2015 Yorkville Endoscopy will no longer be eligible to receive federal funds for services provided to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.' Despite those losses, the clinic later issued a statement  indicating its intention to remain viable. 'Yorkville Endoscopy LLC does not intend to cease operations. Yorkville is hoping to cooperate with regulators to have the recent decision reversed or modified,' the clinic told ABC News. Yorkville Endoscopy did not immediately respond to a request for comment from AP.","Melissa Rivers has filed a lawsuit against Yorkville Endoscopy in New York .

I prayed for a baby and it was answered. ‘I couldn’t win though - I had three boys before I had a girl, then I had three girls and they asked for a brother.’ Mrs Derrick has outlived two of her children and a baby, named Emma, was stillborn. She added: ‘Of course, there have been some good times and some bad times, but I have always thought the best way to get through life is to concentrate on the good times. ‘My mother always used to say if you can’t look after them then you shouldn’t have them in the first place, and I always kept to that. ‘I got a lot of help along the way from friends and family but I did a lot of it myself, I was always cooking and cleaning.’ The family lived in two houses in Knowle and Mr Derrick ran a garage in nearby Ashton Vale. Now, the family occasionally get together for celebrations but there are so many relatives that parties are usually held at a community hall. Mr Derrick died 20 years ago and his widow now lives on her own, but she often has someone coming over to run errands or help out around the house.","Emma Derrick, of Bristol, was plagued by rheumatic fever as a child .

"The judge banned the parents from naming their daughter after the popular Nutella spread - and renamed her Ella instead . A French judge banned parents from naming their daughter Nutella - because it is the trademarked name of a chocolate spread - and renamed her Ella instead. After a newborn baby in Valenciennes was named after the spread, the judge ruled the parents' decision was not in the interest of the child. But in the absence of the parents, the judge chose to rename the girl Ella. 'The name ‘Nutella’ given to the child is the trade name of a spread,' the court ruled, according to La Voix Du Nord. 'And it is contrary to the child’s interest to have a name that can only lead to teasing or disparaging thoughts.' As the parents failed to appear in court on the appointed day in November last year the judge ordered the child, born on September 24, to be renamed Ella. And a second family, from Raismes, who named their child Fraise - or Strawberry - were told the name could ‘be the cause of mockery’ that ‘could have a negative impact on the child’. So they opted to used the name Fraisine, which was popular in the 19th century. In France, parents are free to choose the names of their children, but the registrar checks the name at the time the birth certificate is registered. If the chosen name seems contrary to the child's interest, the registrar must notify the prosecutor -who may then enter a family court order to change the name. The court ruled the parents' decision was against child's interests and would only lead to 'teasing'. File photo .","Judge said parents couldn't use trademarked name of a chocolate spread .

"The future of robots is here - and it hints at a world in which nothing can stand in the way of the mechanical bots. Called Deployable Air-Land Exploration Robot (Daler), the robot adapts to different terrains and changes shape automatically, so it can instantly switch from walking to flying. It was inspired by the movement of the vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, and could one day be used by search-and-rescue teams. Scroll down for video . The Deployable Air-Land Exploration Robot (Daler) robot adapts to different terrains and changes shape automatically, so it can instantly switch from walking (pictured) to flying. It features a foldable skeleton mechanism covered in fabric that can be used both as wings and as legs . Daler features a foldable skeleton mechanism covered in fabric that can be used both as wings and as legs, also known as 'whegs'. ‘The issue of how to use robot in multiple terrains is an ongoing question in robotics research,’ said doctoral assistant Ludovic Daler at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems at the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne. The US military is hoping to develop hawk-like drones that can not only scan dangerous locations from the air, but also fly through buildings. It hopes its new generation of drones will be able to fly up to 45 miles per hour (20 metres per second) while navigating unfamiliar indoor spaces. And, the military wants the drones to be able to do this without any communication from outside operators, and without relying on GPS. The drones are being developed as part of its Fast Lightweight Autonomy (FLA) program, which is currently writing the algorithms to improve their navigation. According to Darpa, these drones could help military teams patrol dangerous environments, as well as help rescue teams respond to disasters such as earthquakes. ‘This project aims to design robots for exploration, search-and-rescue, or surveillance applications. ‘Within these contexts, the robots have to deal with very complex terrains, such as semi-collapsed buildings, deep caverns, or forests with a lot of vegetation.’ He added that the majority of current  robots use only one so-called ‘locomotion strategy’, such as rolling, walking, flying, hovering, climbing, swimming, crawling, or jumping. By using just one range of movements, Mr Daler said existing robots' flexibility and adaptability to different environments is limited. For example, in a search-and-rescue mission winged robots can quickly fly over extended areas, but, exploring confined environments then becomes challenging. ‘For these reasons, robots capable of both ground and flying-hovering locomotion are well suited to navigate complex environments,’ added Mr Daler. He calls this approach ‘adaptive morphology’, in which parts of the robot are shared between the different forms of movement. This approach also means the robot can self-adjust to adapt to which movement it needs to use. Daler was inspired by the movement of the vampire bat (pictured). The designers hope their adaptive robotic ‘bat’ could be used to find victims in dangerous areas after a natural disaster by being remotely deployed to fly to an affected area, before walking through the rubble to search for victims . Mr Daler hopes his adaptive ‘bat’ could be used to find victims in dangerous areas after a natural disaster by being remotely deployed to fly to an affected area, for example. It would then be able to walk through a disaster zone to locate victims, meaning human rescue teams can concentrate their efforts in other areas. Future development of the Daler will include the possibility to hover and to take off autonomously from the ground so the robot can return after a mission. The researchers are also hoping to make adaptive deployable wings that will improve the mobility of existing flying robots. Wing shapes could be modified to increase the efficiency of forward flight, hover flight, and landing. Scary? The strange snake-legged robot could one day help save lives in disaster zones . It walks, crawls, kicks ... and looks like the stuff of sci-fi nightmares. But the terrifyingly named 'Snake Monster' may in fact be bringing robotic rescue workers closer to reality. Scientists hope that research into the six-legged machine will enable robots to become more responsive to their surroundings and move more intuitively, much like living animals. The walking robot owes its name to the snake-like limbs it uses to skillfully manoeuvre its surroundings. In the long-term, scientists hope these machines could be used for urban search and rescue, archaeological exploration and, thanks to the robots' ability to move through pipes, inspection of power plants, refineries and sewers. Carnegie Mellon's Biorobotics Lab developed the mechanics over six months and it is just one example of a robot that could one day be built using a modular system. Researchers are already working on other modules such as force-sensing feet, wheels and tank-like treads that will make it easier to create totally different machines adapted for different environments. 'By creating a system that can be readily reconfigured and that also is easy to program, we believe we can build robots that are not only robust and flexible, but also inexpensive,' said Professor Howie Choset, who led the research. Experts said current robots that only have one movement are limited. They call their new approach ‘adaptive morphology’, in which parts of the robot are shared between the different forms of movement (pictured). This approach also means the robot can self-adjust to adapt to which movement it needs to use .","The robot is called Deployable Air-Land Exploration Robot (Daler)

The most remarkable thing about the two images is their sheer similarity. While the colour is brighter in the 'after' image and her skin tone and hair appear warmer, Petra's body and her proportions appear to be exactly the same. The rest of the images have the same casually seductive feel. In one picture, Petra leans against a French window, in the mulberry pink Jessie set of lace laid on to gold fabric. The bra cup also includes a secret sling that promises to banish the 'double boob' effect. In the Ana, she perches on the edge of the bed wearing the black mesh bra which features extra straps over both cups and a diamante feature at the centre of the Brazilian pants.

"A Mexican photographer has captured the mysterious behavior of Munk's devil rays shooting into the sky. Octavio Aburto, 41, took the stunning shots of the animals leaping more than 10 feet into the air in Cabo Pulmo National Park on Mexico's Gulf of California coast. The photographer and conservationist looked on as the startling spectacle unfolded - where thousands of the rays swim together and burst into the air in unison. Scroll down for video . Up in the air: Munk's devil rays, which live along the Pacific coast of Central and South America, can jump up to 10 feet above the water . Lift off: Theories suggest that the rays may jump to remove parasites or impress mates . Munk's rays, which flap their wings like birds when they leap above the sea, is one of the species of devil rays that leap out of the sea . Mr Aburto, who is an assistant professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California, said it is not known why the rays 'jump' out of the water. Common theories include that the rays jump to remove parasites from their skin or as part of a mating ritual, though both male and female Munk's rays jump. One theory holds that the rays leap by accident because they are moving quickly beneath the water's surface and do not realize that moving upwards will send them flying into the air. Oceanographer Walter Munk, for whom the animals were named in the  1980s, said 'They just jump for the joy of it. Why shouldn't they jump for the joy?' Jumping for joy: Walter Munk, the oceanographer for whom the rays were named in the 1980s, likes to think his namesake leaps because it is happy . Acrobats of the sea: The rays are known for doing flips after they jettison themselves into the air and then landing flat on their bellies with a splat . The rays are about three feet in wingspan and are called 'tortilla' by local fisherman, according to Science Friday. The food-inspired name came from the animal's acrobatic flips while in the air, which are followed by flat landings reminiscent of the Mexican flatbread. 'They are some of the great acrobats in the marine world,' Mr Aburto said. Though all species of devil rays jump out of the water, Munk's rays are the only type that do so while swimming around in groups, which can be as large as 250,000. The fish jump out of the water and flap their wings like birds regularly during mass migrations along the coast. Rays-ing the bar: While other species of devil ray are known to jump, the Munk's devil ray is the only one that jumps while swimming in schools . School's out for summer: Swarms of jumping Munk rays undergo mass migration along the Pacific coast in groups as large as 250,000 . Known as Mobula munkiana, the sea creatures are most commonly found along in the eastern Pacific from Mexico to South America. 'Seeing these devil rays jumping out of the water is something extraordinary,' said Mr Aburto, who has been photographing Mexico's coastal waters since 1994. The conservationist said that the sound of the rays hitting the water when they land creates a strange rain-like sound. 'You can wake up very early in the morning and hear the noise almost in darkness,' he said. Soaking up the rays: The animals are found on the sunny coastlines of the eastern Pacific from the Gulf of California in Mexico down to Peru . Ray-ning on the sea: Mr Aburto says that the pattering of thousands of rays falling back into the water can sound like rain on the sea . 'Tortilla': Fishermen who encounter the rays have nicknamed the small, flat creatures after the floury staple of traditional Mexican food . 'Suddenly, when the sun starts coming out, all the ray silhouettes can be seen everywhere.' Mr Aburto said that at the jumping's peak rays can be seen leaping for several miles, and 'Sometimes the frenzy is so high that some of these animals can land on the boats.' Though the teeming mass of Munk's rays are impressive, conservation group Red List says that the species is under threat. The large schools are susceptible to gillnet fishing, where nets are hung vertically to catch animals by their gills, where more than 60 Munk's devil rays can be caught in one net. Not just any old Munk: The species is sometimes caught accidentally by gilnetting fishermen and has been listed as near-threatened by Red List . The life aquatic: Octavio Aburto, 41, has been photographing and working with marine animals on Mexico's Pacific coast since 1994 .","Octavio Aburto, 41, has captured stunning shots of Munk's devil rays leaping off Mexico's Gulf of California coast .

"Luis Moreno Jr., 26, was arrested for kidnapping after police pulled him over and discovered  two hostages in the back of his SUV . A New Jersey man was arrested for kidnapping after police pulled him over for apparently driving solo in a carpool lane and discovered two men were being held against their will in the back of his SUV. Luis Moreno Jr., 26, was pulled over by Port Authority cops on Friday shortly after 8am when he appeared to be driving alone as he entered the carpool lane approaching the George Washington Bridge on I-95 in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Moreno told an officer he had two passengers sitting in the back of his 2002 Toyota Sequoia, which had a Texas license plate, and rolled down the rear driver's side window so the policeman could see two men seated in the third row of the SUV, reported New York Daily News. The officer let Moreno go. But just as he began to pull away one of his passengers hung out of the open window and began yelling for help, a police spokesman said. Moreno kept driving after the officer  ordered him to stop, but was soon  stuck in thick rush-hour traffic. More Port Authority officials arrived on the scene and ordered him to shut off his car. Officers interviewed one of Moreno's passengers, a 33-year-old man, in Spanish. The man said Moreno had picked him up in Texas and agreed to drive him to Maryland for a fee. But on arrival Moreno had demanded more money than initially agreed. When the man was unable to pay Moreno locked the doors, took the man's cell phone away and began driving towards New York. When police inspected the vehicle they discovered Moreno had disabled the locks for the rear window and doors, giving only the driver the ability to control them. One passenger said Moreno had agreed to drive him from Texas to Maryland for a fee. But when they arrived Moreno demanded more money, and then took away the man's cell phone and locked him in the SUV when he couldn't pay . Language barriers prevented officials on the scene from communicating with Moreno's second passenger, a 24-year-old Asian man who did not speak English. Personnel from the U.S. Department of State were then called and the man revealed he had also been held against his will. Moreno, who is wanted on numerous parole violations in Texas, was arrested at the scene and his car was impounded by Port Authority police. Moreno has been charged with kidnapping and criminal restraint, as well as receiving stolen property and driving with a suspended license. He is being held in jail and his bail is set at $1million.","Luis Moreno Jr. was driving in a carpool lane when he was pulled over .

Losing your sexual appetite, and rejecting your partner (2%) 15% of women said there partner realised their cheating ways by their varying mood swings, claiming their extreme moments of happiness were a dead giveaway. Unless she is genuinely swamped with her workload, being consistently late home from work is the number five mistake women make when they cheat. 9% of males found out about their partner's cheating due to their inability to contact their other half when they were late home from work. Rounding off the remaining five mistakes are a sudden trend in women concealing their feelings, being sarcastic or impassive towards their relationship, a loss of interest and affection in their partner, flirting with other men and the loss of a sexual appetite. Experts from Victoria Milan found that the results were in line with their predictions based on existing data. Rejecting sex with a partner is not an especially tell-tale sign for female cheaters because most men in all kinds of relationships report that they have higher sexual expectations from their relationship than do their female partners. Loss of interest in your partner, and a resulting lack of affection came in at eighth place on the list .
